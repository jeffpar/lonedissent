Briefs in current Supreme Court cases can *finally* be obtained directly from the Supreme Court, through
its website, without relying on a third-party service.  Historically, that was done through the
[American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/preview_home/briefs-from-past-terms/).  However, they were a poor custodian of U.S. Supreme Court briefs, and in fact,
all the briefs they used to provide seem to have disappeared.  In recent years, [SCOTUSblog](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/terms/) has been a better source for briefs, and it's a shame that the Supreme Court "outsourced" this important responsibility for so many years to the ABA.

To find briefs from the Supreme Court, you must use their [Docket Search](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docket.aspx) feature.  For example, if you search for [No. 17-1594](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-1594.html), you'll see links to all the documents electronically filed with the Court for that particular case.
For briefs that predate the electronic age, your best bet is to visit the nearest law library that the Supreme Court
has [designated](https://www.supremecourt.gov/meritsbriefs/briefsource.aspx) an official "depository" of Supreme Court briefs.

You may also find something interesting in the tiny collection of [Archived Briefs](/briefs/archived) that we and others have scanned over the years.
