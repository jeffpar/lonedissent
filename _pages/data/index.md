Our data comes from a variety of sources, including:

- [The U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)
- [The Supreme Court Database](http://scdb.wustl.edu/)
- [The Oyez Project](https://www.oyez.org/)
- [The Library of Congress (U.S. Reports Collection)](https://www.loc.gov/collections/united-states-reports/)

From those data sources, we build our own tables, cross-check the data, look for [discrepancies](/blog/2019/02/18/),
and then build an assortment of pages:

- [Cases](/cases)
  - [All Cases](/cases/all)
  - [Lone Dissents](/cases/loners)
  - [Terms of the Court](/cases/terms)
- [Justices](/justices)
  - [Lone Dissents](/justices/loners)
  - [Majority Opinions](/justices/all)
- [Transcripts](/transcripts)
  - [Featured Transcripts](/transcripts/featured)
  - [All Available Pre-1968 Transcripts](/transcripts/pre-1968)
  - [All Available 1968-Present Transcripts](/transcripts/scotus)
- [Advocates](/advocates/top100)
  - [Top Advocates](/advocates/top100#top-advocates)

We've also created a few random pages that have no real value but struck us as mildly interesting:

- [Loner Parties](/trivia/parties)
