Our data comes from a variety of sources, including:

- [The U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/)
- [The Supreme Court Database](http://scdb.wustl.edu/)
- [The Oyez Project](https://www.oyez.org/)
- [The Library of Congress (U.S. Reports Collection)](https://www.loc.gov/collections/united-states-reports/)

From those data sources, we build our own tables, cross-check the data, look for [discrepancies](/blog/2019/02/18/),
and then build an assortment of pages:

- [Cases](/cases)
- [Justices](/justices)
- [Transcripts](/transcripts)
- [Advocates](/advocates/top100)

We've also created a few random pages that have no real value but struck us as mildly interesting:

- [Loner Parties](/trivia/parties)

If you have ideas for other kinds of reports or summaries you'd like to see, [let us know](mailto:loners@pcjs.org).
