<p style="text-align:center"><b>OPENING ARGUMENT OF <br>
H. ALBERT YOUNG, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>It seems that I have a Herculean task to perform in attempting to add to what 
has already been presented for some eight hours of argument before this Court. But 
there are some points which I will only touch upon briefly since it has been so 
ably presented by counsel in all of the other cases that preceded mine for argument.
</p>
<p>In this case, involving the State of Delaware, a petition for writ of certiorari 
and supporting brief was filed on November 13 of this year. The Delaware Supreme 
Court handed down its mandate on September 9, 1952, and certiorari was granted on November 24, 1952, the Court advising me that I would be permitted to file my brief not 
later than three weeks after argument, and I can assure the Court that the brief 
will be in before the three weeks are out. </p>
<p>Jurisdiction in this case is invoked under 28 United States Code, section 1257, 
paragraph 3. The validity of the Delaware constitutional provisions and the statutes 
invoked was challenged by the respondents. The pertinent provisions of the Delaware 
constitution and statute are as follows, section 1, Article 10 of the Constitution of the 
State of Delaware being as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The General Assembly shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a 
general and efficient system of free public schools, and may require by law that 
every child, not physically or mentally disabled, shall attend the public schools, 
unless educated by other means. </p>
  <p>Section 2. In addition to the income of the investments of the Public School Fund, the General Assembly shall make provision for the annual payment of not less than one hundred thousand dollars for the benefit 
of the free public schools which, with the income of the investments of the Public 
School Fund shall be equitably apportioned among the school districts of the State 
as the General Assembly shall provide; and the money so apportioned shall be used 
exclusively for the payment of teachers&#39; salaries and for furnishing free textbooks;
provided, however, that in such apportionment, no distinction shall be made on account of race or color, and separate schools 
for white and colored children shall be maintained. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The statutory counterpart provides</b>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The State Board of Education is authorized, empowered, directed and required 
to maintain a uniform, equal and effective system of public schools throughout the State, 
and shall cause the provisions of this Chapter, the bylaws or rules and regulations and the policies of the State Board of Education to 
be carried into effect. The schools provided shall be of two kinds: those for white 
children and those for colored children. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The State contended that under our constitution and statutes, segregation in 
the public schools was lawful and not in violation of the equal protection clause 
of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that if inequalities were found to exist, any judgment 
in favor of the plaintiffs should be limited to an injunction directing the defendants
to equalize the facilities within a reasonable time. 
</p>
<p>The Delaware Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court held that these 
provisions, insofar as they require segregation in the public schools based on race or color, do not offend against the provisions 
of the Fourteenth Amendment forbidding any state to deny any citizen the equal protection 
of the laws, so that the Delaware Supreme Court did sustain the State&#39;s position 
that segregation per se is valid in the State of Delaware. </p>
<p>The cases of Plessy v. Ferguson and Gong Lum v. Rice, the Delaware Supreme Court 
said, are decisive of the question. </p>
<p>It is important in the approach to the question in our case, which is a very 
narrow one with respect to the form of the decree, if Your Honors please, that I 
read from portions of the opinion in order to demonstrate to this Court how the 
Delaware Supreme Court arrived at its decision. On page 43—and I am sorry that I 
cannot refer to a brief, but I can assure the Court that it will be fully covered—
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Page 43 of what? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Page 43 of the opinion, which will be found in the supplementary appendix 
of appellees—it is the blue-covered book —at the bottom of page 43, the supreme 
court said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A detailed review of these cases is unnecessary since we are cited to no case 
holding to the contrary. They establish the principle that the constitutional guarantee 
of equal protection of the laws does not prevent the establishment by the state 
of separate schools for whites and Negroes, provided that the facilities afforded 
by the state to the one class are substantially equal to those afforded to the other—often 
referred to as the `separate but equal&#39; doctrine. The question of segregation in the schools, under these authorities, is one of 
policy, and it is for the people of our state, through their duly chosen representatives, 
to determine what that policy shall be. When so determined, it must be given effect 
by our courts, subject always to the rule enjoined both by the Constitution of the 
United States and our own statute, that substantially equal treatment must be accorded 
. . . </p>
  <p>The refusal of the Chancellor to enter the declaratory judgment prayed for was therefore, in our opinion, correct. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Delaware Supreme Court, however, held that an injunction where an inequality is found to exist commanding the defendants to admit plaintiffs to the designated schools maintained for white children was 
required by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The asserted 
conflict, the court held, of our constitutional and statutory provision with the 
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was the sole basis for the judgment of the 
Delaware court upholding the type of relief that was granted. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Mr. Attorney General, may I ask you whether I am to 
assume that the finding of the Chancellor on page 194a of your blue appendix, Folio 
579— </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: What page is that? </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: 193a, Folio 579. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: If Your Honor please, the reason for the confusion in these things—
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I will hand you mine. </p>
<p>Am I to assume that that is a finding which persisted through the decision of 
the Supreme Court of Delaware? I marked it. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: I see, Your Honor. </p>
<p>No, Your Honor, because the supreme court held that that was not—if it was a 
finding, it was an irrelevant finding, and that it had—as a matter of fact, the 
decision was that segregation per se is valid in the State of Delaware, and that 
had no relevancy to the finding or the conclusion. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: To the finding. But that paragraph is in terms of a finding on the evidence as to what factors, whether any legal 
inference is to be drawn from it or not. You will notice the terms in which Your 
Chancellor stated that on the evidence—doesn&#39;t he say something about &quot;on the evidence I find this is a fact&quot;? 
Does that survive his modification of the decree by the supreme court? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: It does not. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: It does not? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: It does not, Your Honor, and I will come to that in the course of 
my argument. </p>
<p>The Delaware Supreme Court held that the right to equal opportunity is a personal 
right; that the rights under the equal protection clause are personal and present, 
and for its authority relied on the cases about which so much was said during the 
course of the arguments here, the Gaines case, the Sipuel case, and the Sweatt case.
</p>
<p>Those cases, however, did not involve a constitutional provision of a state. Furthermore, there was no showing in those cases that equal facilities 
could be provided in a reasonable time. There is quite a difference, I submit, between 
not being able to afford any facilities, and correcting certain disparities that 
exist, which would equalize the existing facilities and educational opportunities;
and for that reason, I submit that the Chancellor and the supreme court, which affirmed the decree of the Chancellor, were in error. </p>
<p>Those cases, the Gaines case, the Sipuel case, and the Sweatt case, were not 
considered by the three-judge court in the Davis and Briggs cases as requiring any 
relief other than an injunction compelling the defendants to equalize the facilities 
and giving them a reasonable time to do so. </p>
<p>Now, this case involved two school districts. One is known as the Claymont School 
District, and the other the Hockessin School District. </p>
<p>In the Claymont School district, there is one high school, the 
Claymont High School, for white children only. There is 
also a high school in the city of Wilmington, some nine miles away, the Howard High 
School for Negro children. The plaintiff Belton, fifteen years of age and of high school age, attending the tenth grade and living in 
Claymont, was required to go to the Howard High School in the city of Wilmington. 
There are about 404 pupils in the Claymont High School and there are 1274 pupils 
in the Howard High School. </p>
<p>I would like to point out that with the Howard High School there is an annex 
some nine blocks away known as the Carver School, which is devoted primarily to 
vocational study. </p>
<p>This particular plaintiff, who went to Howard High School, took up typing and 
shorthand, and two afternoons a week would be required to go from Howard High School 
to Carver in order to take up those studies. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs contended that there was inequality. The State took the position 
that there was no inequality; that the curricula were the same or substantially 
the same; that the physical facilities were the same; that the teacher preparation 
was the same; and many other factors to show that there was equality. We also pointed
out, if the Court please, that the Carver Annex, which was some nine blocks away 
from the Howard School, was to be abandoned, and that there were plans for its abandonment before the suit was even started, 
and that there was to be a consolidation at the Howard High School for Negro students 
with respect to its academic studies and vocational work. 
</p>
<p>The court found that there was disparity between the two schools, and they found 
that the disparity existed in some items, some factors, one being the gymnasium—not 
that the gymnasium at Howard High was not a good gymnasium—it was a fine gymnasium,
but that it was overcrowded, and would be overcrowded because of the number of 
students attending. 
</p>
<p>They found that travel, not because of distance itself, made for inequality, 
but because the petitioner or the plaintiff had to go to Howard High, and then from 
Howard High had to walk the nine blocks to Carver, which, we contended, would be 
abandoned; and the court also found that the physical education classes were larger 
than they should be in order to afford proper and adequate instruction. </p>
<p>They also found disparity with respect to the playground at Carver—Carver, 
the annex that we said was going to be abandoned, and that we had admitted was inadequate; but because Carver had no playground, 
although Howard High had the opportunity to permit its pupils to go to a park which adjoined Howard High consisting of some ten acres, the fact that Carver had no 
playground was considered as one of the factors making for inequality, and, of course, it was held that the Carver building itself was wholly inadequate.
</p>
<p>We contested these questions, but nevertheless we showed the court that the State 
had embarked upon a plan and program of improving the conditions in Howard High 
School, and we showed that Howard High School was going to be enlarged. We also 
showed that there was going to be a school built in the county, another school in Middletown for Negroes, which is not in the record. But I would like 
to say to the Court, it is about to be completed at a cost of L35 million dollars; and we were going to show that the students 
at the Howard High School in the junior high grades were going to be transferred 
to another school known as the Bancroft School, which is presently occupied and 
attended by white children, and that will be a school primarily for Negroes, so 
that the tension of overcrowding will be relieved at the Howard High School. </p>
<p>The court, in finding these items of disparity with respect to the Carver building, 
which it was not going to ignore, the fact that this was a building that we said 
we were going to abandon, and the fact that the gym was overcrowded, and the fact 
that there was this travel required by the plaintiff from Howard High to Carver, 
found that as to the allocation of public funds, there was equality of treatment; 
that as to the buildings proper they were the same; that as to accreditation, they 
were equal; that as to equipment and instruction material, they were equal; that the libraries were the same, 
with the library of Howard being larger; that the physical and mental health and 
nursing services at Howard, the colored school, were superior; and the court went 
on to say that the other differences were too insubstantial to find—to support a 
finding of inequality. </p>
<p>The other case had to do with an elementary school in what is known as Hockessin. 
School 107 is the school for colored children, a two-room school, having 44 pupils. Number 29 is a four-room school having 111 pupils. There are two teachers in 107; there are four teachers 
in 29. In that case, travel—with respect to travel, no bus transportation was provided 
the plaintiff, although there was bus transportation provided for white children.
</p>
<p>In that case it was held that 107 receives equal or greater support now, and it did receive equal and greater support at the time of the hearing, 
although there was evidence that prior thereto the colored school did not receive 
equal support, which, perhaps, made for the disparity in the maintenance and upkeep 
of that particular school. </p>
<p>Both buildings—both are brick buildings; both are substantially
contructed, so that the court in the case involving the elementary schools which have classes from the first grade to the sixth grade, held there 
was disparity in value, in upkeep, in exterior painting and floors, in toilet facilities, fire hazard, auditorium and custodial 
services. 
</p>
<p>We contend that these items making for disparity, as was found in the Delaware 
case, are such as can be readily corrected, and that the State should have been 
given the time, or the Board of Education should have been given the time, where 
there was this recognition of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, in order to correct 
the inequalities that exist. </p>
<p>The defendants showed the court that there was under way in the City of Wilmington, 
as I stated before, a far-reaching program for the improvement of facilities in the Negro schools. As I said, the Carver 
School was to be abandoned. The junior high school pupils at the Howard School, 
that is, the Negro high school, were to be transferred to the Bancroft School so 
as to relieve it from crowding, and the Howard School was to be enlarged. There 
were to be new shops; the laboratories would be added, and the Bancroft School is 
to be a completely modern junior high school. All of these things were to be equalized, 
and will be equalized, by September of 1953, and the Middletown High School, as 
I indicated before, will be completed at a cost of 1.35 million dollars. </p>
<p>As to the form of the decree, the court enjoined the defendants from denying plaintiffs admittance to the two schools, retaining— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Your objection here, Mr. Attorney General, is as to the fitness of the decree with respect to immediacy? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Correct. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Your contention is that it should wait until later? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is correct. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Will you address yourself as to why we should overrule the 
findings of the Chancellor? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Yes. The contention is that, based on the ground of the Chancellor 
and the Delaware Supreme Court, in affirming the Chancellor, did not interpret the 
cases upon which they relied, the Sipuel case and the Gaines case and the Sweatt 
case, in making a finding that unless they grant immediate relief it would be in 
violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p>May I refer to the portion of the opinion of the supreme court on page 63:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In affirming the Chancellor&#39;s order we have not overlooked the fact that the 
defendants may at some future date apply for a modification of the order if, in their judgment, the inequalities as between the Howard and Claymont schools or as between School No. 29 and School No. 107 have then been removed. 
As to Howard, the defendants, as above stated, assert that when the Howard-Carver changes are completed, equality will exist. The Chancellor
apparently thought the contrary. We do not concur in his conclusion, since we 
think that that question, if it arises, is one which will have to be decided in 
the light of the facts then existing and applicable principles of the law. The Chancellor 
properly reserved jurisdiction of the cause to grant such further and additional
relief as might appear appropriate in the future, and we construe this reservation 
to be a general reservation to any party to the cause to make an application to 
modify the order in any respect if and when changed conditions are believed to warrant such action. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Has this litigation had any effect upon other school districts in your State, Mr. Attorney General? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Well, I must speak outside the record. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Yes, that is my question. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: As a matter of fact, that is the reason I am here now, because of 
the terrific impact upon the rest of the State by this decision. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Would not each district, whatever the units may be, call for a separate assessment of the conditions in that district, the way your court did here? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: What it would mean, Your Honor, is that each case might involve litigation.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: And it would also prevent, perhaps, the legislators from voting for 
particular allotments for particular school districts, not knowing whether they can maintain the &quot;separate but equal&quot; phase of it or 
not. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I may be wrong, but I should assume 
that it is almost inevitable that the conditions in the various districts would not be identical, and therefore differentiation would be almost 
inevitable, and the claim that the two colored and white schools are not the same 
would almost inevitably be made, and it would have to be decided with proper reference 
to each set of circumstances. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: I absolutely agree with you, sir; I absolutely agree, but what I contend 
is this: that in a state which recognizes the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, where 
inequalities exist, and it can be shown that those inequalities can be corrected, 
let us say overnight or within a week, to make an order that the Negro children shall be admitted 
into the white school is indirectly saying—abolishing segregation. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Am I to infer that you think that the thrust of the 
decision of the Supreme Court is that if inequity is shown, and this whole litigation is unlike the litigation in all the other 
records—that if inequality is shown, a decree must be issued at once, although it 
might be corrected overnight? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is correct. That seems to be my feeling about it and my understanding 
of that opinion—that as long as inequality— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: In other words, you are arguing on the assumption that that is what the opinion of your supreme court means? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Exactly. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: How can you say that when you yourself, as I understood it, 
said that it would not be corrected until September 1, 1953? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That, Your Honor, went as far as the Claymont School, the high school, 
was concerned, where we said a new building had to be constructed. But in the Hockessin situation, a two-room school, where we could, perhaps within ten days, put on an additional room or 
improve the toilet facilities or those other things that Your Honor will note in 
the opinion, we feel that they can be corrected with dispatch. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: So it is a problem of weighing the time it would take to make 
the corrections? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is correct. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Even in the one that is not to be ready until 1953? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is correct. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: You take the position that that is an adequate time? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: We think that is a reasonable time, as long as we have shown— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: As long as there are facilities and institutions afforded? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Precisely; and as long as it is shown that we are willing and able 
to do it, and that there is every reason to believe that it will be done, the &quot;separate 
but equal&quot; doctrine being recognized by the court—there should be no immediacy for the entrance of those Negro pupils into the white schools. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Has litigation of this type reached your supreme court in the 
last five or ten years? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: This is the first in the history of the State. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Do I understand that the inequality is largely a matter 
of overcrowding, relative overcrowding? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: I want to differentiate between the two cases. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: 
Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: In the Claymont High School, they claimed it was due to overcrowding, 
not in the school entirely, but only in physical education classes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Has there been a shift of population? That is, have you 
had a migration which has occurred since the war, with war industries? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Well, we have some, yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: You have some. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: But I do not know whether we can attribute too much to that. But the 
fact is that the Howard High School had both the junior and the senior pupils there, 
and the fact that we are taking those pupils away from the Howard High School into 
this other school will certainly correct this situation. </p>
<p>But apparently the Delaware Supreme Court seemed to term this inequality only 
as to the overcrowding in a particular class, which did not make for proper instruction 
in physical education; but it seemed to hold that as to all other classes the difference 
in size between 25 pupils in white schools and 30 or 31 or 32 in classes in the 
colored schools did not make for inequality so as to affect educational opportunity 
or instruction. </p>
<p>The State contends that where disparity exists, under the 
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the rights of Negro children are protected by a decree compelling school administrators to equalize the facilities in the segregated schools involved where a state constitutional 
provision makes mandatory the maintenance of separate schools for white and colored children, and where school administrators 
have reasonably shown that the existing inequality can and probably will be corrected within a reasonable time. </p>
<p>So the court of chancery, of course, sat as a court of equity, and the form of 
the decree, we contend, violates the fundamental equitable principles as laid down 
in Eccles v. Peoples Bank. In that case the court said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is always the duty of a court of equity to strike a proper balance between 
the needs of the plaintiff and the consequences of giving the desired relief.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no showing that the State could not equalize or that it was unwilling 
to equalize, and the effect of the decree is demoralizing to the Negro pupils as 
well as to the white pupils, to the teachers, to the State Board of Education. There 
is no permanency, there is no stability, as one of the counsel mentioned during the course of the argument in the Virginia case. </p>
<p>The decree in its present form, which says that the Negro children shall be permitted to go to the white school and that the Board of Education 
may come in next week, next month, and modify the decree, would result in shunting 
those Negro children back and forth. There would be no stability, there would be 
no permanency. I would rather if the court had said that segregation per se is bad: &quot;Let the 
Negro children go to the white schools.&quot; </p>
<p>[Whereupon, a luncheon recess was taken.] </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>AFTERNOON SESSION </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Mr. Justice Frankfurter, you asked me whether the Chancellor&#39;s finding 
on the evidence that segregation produces detrimental results so far as educational 
opportunities are concerned, if it is applied—and I call the Court&#39;s attention to the opinion of the Supreme 
Court of Delaware on page 44, beginning with the third paragraph: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is said that the uncontradicted evidence adduced by the plaintiffs shows that 
state-imposed segregation in the public schools and equality of educational opportunity are inherently incompatible, and that the Chancellor so held. The Chancellor indeed found on 
the evidence that segregation itself results in the Negro&#39;s receiving inferior educational 
opportunities, and expressed the opinion that the `separate but equal&#39; doctrine should be rejected.
He nevertheless recognized that his finding was immaterial to the legal conclusion drawn from the authorities above cited. 
We agree that it is immaterial, and hence see no occasion to review it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Therefore, it is not before us. 
</p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is right.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: But does that necessarily follow? They did not set it aside, 
so that you have a finding of your Chancellor so far as segregation is concerned 
in Delaware that the result of it is the affording of an inferior opportunity of 
education, and your supreme court says that nevertheless the Supreme Court of the 
United States, in effect, has held that that can never be a constitutional ground. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: So did the Chancellor, Your Honor. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: But you still have your finding that, so far as Delaware is 
concerned—and I presume he was not looking at evidence anywhere but Delaware—that 
the system of segregation there, even though the facilities, physical facilities, are equal, results in 
inferior education for them. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: He did so state. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: We have that finding without its being set aside. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Well, I think we have it, in effect, set aside when the supreme court 
says that he considered it immaterial to the conclusion in his case and the decision in his case. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: That is right. He considered it immaterial; but nevertheless, are we not faced with this situation: Do you conceive that 
segregation might be held on evidence in some places to supply equal opportunities 
for education, while in other it might be held that the situation was such that 
it gave an inferior opportunity for education? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Depending on the facilities offered, and the educational opportunities. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: I mean assuming that the facilities are 
the same— </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: —do you conceive that it is impossible for segregation in 
one place to result in an equality of opportunity of education, while in another 
it might result in inequality of opportunity for education? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: No, I cannot conceive of that myself. </p>
<p>Now, it may be that— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: There might be many things involved, might there not? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is true, but I am not prepared to say whether, all factors being 
equal, mere segregation of and by itself will bring about inferiority so far as 
educational opportunities are concerned. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Well, assuming that you had facts, and that your court found 
on the facts that in Delaware, where your two schools functioned, and with the general 
conditions of education in Delaware and the relationship between the races and all of that was such that 
even though the facilities were identical—physical facilities—nevertheless, in Delaware, the results of segregation were to give 
an unequal opportunity of education to the colored people. Would you say that, assuming 
that finding on local facts, and it is accepted, that the separate but equal doctrine 
would not make it necessary to state that? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: I would not, if Your Honor please, under our constitution and its statutory counterpart—we are required to maintain separate schools for white and colored as long as we afford them equal opportunities 
and equal facilities, and I think that that would merely be an oblique way of striking 
down segregation and desegregating schools. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: If you assume that the facts are correctly found. Suppose 
I asked you to assume that the court found those facts, and assume that he is right, 
and you had no way to overturn them. He would say that conditions in Delaware—given 
consideration on the facts—require him to see whether or not the colored people get an equal 
opportunity for education. </p>
<p>Now, I find that they do so far as the physical results are concerned, but I am led to the conclusion from the evidence and find from the evidence that 
they do not because the relationship that exists here, and by reason of the manner 
of the going to school, and the mixture in other places and so forth—I find that 
the effect on the children is that they get an inferior opportunity for 
education. </p>
<p>Would you say that that would still not bring them within the &quot;separate but equal&quot; 
doctrine? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: I would, Your Honor. I would because I say that would be violative 
of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and would also be violative 
of our own constitutional provisions, because we are assuming now facilities being equal, educational opportunities 
being equal; I would like to say I do not know what evidence Your Honor is referring 
to that the chancellor could rely on, other than the sociologists and anthropologists and psychologists.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: I just read the findings, and I asked you the question at 
the beginning of these arguments, you may remember. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: I remember. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: About the difference in findings, and I wondered—both sides 
seem to be relying on the findings so much, and I wondered if the assumption we 
must make from that is that both sides believe that it could be found in one state 
and one locality by reason of a different situation that opportunities were unequal, even though 
the facilities were equal, while in another state that would not be the case.
</p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: I do not subscribe to that, Your Honor. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Mr. Attorney General, since I got you into this trouble, 
perhaps I might help straighten out the way the matter lies in my mind. I had not 
read that sentence to which you called attention in the opinion of the supreme court. 
I think for myself this situation is very different from the Kansas situation. In 
the Kansas situation, we have a finding of fact similar to the finding made by your Chancellor, and the court said that finding does 
not bear on the legal question; namely, that the State has power to segregate, no 
matter what the psychological consequences may be, and that is what your Chancellor found. </p>
<p>As I understand it myself, when your supreme court came to review the decision 
of the Chancellor, it said that, inasmuch as his finding of fact is irrelevant, 
it was not going to review it. Therefore, we have a finding of an inferior court specifically not reviewed by the highest court of the State. </p>
<p>The Chancellor found that on his appraisal of the evidence—insofar as I am concerned, it may well be that your supreme court might not have reached 
that conclusion, and might not have weighed the evidence that the Chancellor did, 
and therefore we have not got, for myself, in this case, what we have in 
the Kansas case, a finding of fact which binds us, because for all I know your supreme 
court might have disagreed with your Chancellor, and then we would be in a position 
where the highest court said that the evidence does not yield to the conclusions 
that the Chancellor thought it yielded. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is precisely the point, Your Honor, and what is more, a review 
of the opinion would show that the Delaware Supreme Court did not agree with many 
things that the Chancellor said in his opinion in the lower court. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Yes. The legal position that you take is on the assumption 
that was presented by the Kansas case. I think that your record presents a different 
set of facts. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Exactly. There was no finding of fact that was considered at all. 
It was considered immaterial to the issue. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: A very powerful finding by the Chancellor. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Oh, yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: I do not like to interrupt again, but taking that as true, if we assume and admit such a finding is relevant, you would be 
in a situation of having a finding by your Chancellor which is relevant, which might cause the case to turn one way or the other, which 
has not been reviewed by your highest court. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is right. But there is one thing I want to make plain: that notwithstanding 
that finding, and notwithstanding the fact that it was disregarded by the supreme 
court, I nevertheless address Your Honor&#39;s attention to the point that the shape 
of the decree, in any event, was not a proper decree under the circumstances,
even if that were so. 
</p>
<p>Let us assume that were so, and it just desegregated the schools; nevertheless, 
the form of the decree being in conflict with the other jurisdiction, was not a 
proper decree, taking into account the needs and the relief to be granted, and the public interest involved. </p>
<p>This Court, as I contend, is not exercising—it was not a question of abuse of discretion, and it is not a matter of administration nor a matter of enforcing the injunction. </p>
<p>Both courts, my position is, said that under and only by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment was it justified to make the kind of decree it did.
</p>
<p>The decree in the court below, while asserting that the plaintiffs were entitled to relief, made no attempt to assess the effect of its decree on the defendants, on the children and their parents, both white and 
colored, in the school districts affected. No consideration was given to the ability of the defendants to equalize the facilities involved 
within a reasonable time; no consideration was given to the effect of a possible 
later decree based on changing circumstances; no consideration was given to the effect of the decree on the 
school administrators who would be faced with the problem of determining how and 
where to enroll children in the various school districts in the State. No consideration 
was given to the effect of the decree on the public generally and on the legislature
in planning for the future, in allocating funds for the maintenance and construction of school facilities. </p>
<p>The court below stated that the plaintiffs&#39; rights were personal and present, and this does not necessarily mean that they are entitled immediately 
to admittance to the schools maintained for white children only. The plaintiffs&#39; 
rights are given full consideration when the court orders the defendants to proceed forthwith to make the facilities 
of the respective schools equal. </p>
<p>In this case, too, I am grateful to the Attorney General for his brief, and in 
his amicus curiae brief on page 28 I would like the Court to take note of what he 
said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If, in any of the present cases, the Court should hold that to compel colored 
children to attend `separate but equal&#39; public schools is unconstitutional, the 
Government would suggest that in shaping the relief the Court should take into account 
the need, not only for prompt vindication of the constitutional rights violated, 
but also for orderly and reasonable solution of the vexing problems which may arise in eliminating such segregation. 
The public interest plainly would be served by avoidance of needless dislocation 
and confusion in the administration of the school systems affected. It must be recognized that racial segregation in public schools has been in effect in many states for a long time. 
Its roots go deep in the history and traditions of these states. The practical difficulties 
which may be met in making progressive adjustments to a nonsegregated system cannot 
be ignored or minimized. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: I asked a question similar to this before. Why do you contend 
that that is a problem here? Is it a violation of the federal law or a violation 
of the Federal Constitution that the Delaware Supreme Court has acted somewhat precipitately, 
from your point of view? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: It is because, Your Honor, we contend that the 
supreme court, affirming the Chancellor who acted in this matter, in shaping the 
form of the decree, said that he was compelled to make that kind of a decree under 
the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It was not a question of 
exercising discretion; in fact, it negated that proposition. </p>
<p>If, for example, he would reach the same result by saying that he is exercising 
his discretion, perhaps we would have another matter. But he said he was compelled 
to issue that kind of a decree under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS</b>: Is that because the right is personal? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Because the right is personal, and depending upon the cases of Sweatt 
and the Gaines case; and, of course, we differentiate between those cases, cases where there was no facility; there was no expectancy 
of any facility within a reasonable time, as compared with a case where there is 
the ability and the willingness to equalize. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: It is difficult for me to grasp what the state court of Delaware 
was saying when it said it was not acting within its discretion. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Well, the supreme court pointed out in its opinion and stated that 
they were relying solely— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: It is on page 44. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: On page 57 the court cast aside—the Delaware Supreme Court—two preliminary matters upon which, perhaps, the injunction could have 
been or the decree could have been handed down, but said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But we prefer to rest our decision upon another ground. With deference to the decisions in the Briggs and Davis cases, which 
we have carefully examined and considered, we cannot reconcile the denial of prompt 
relief with the pronouncements of the Supreme Court of the United States. If, as 
we have seen, the right to equal protection of the laws is a `personal and present&#39; 
one, how can these plaintiffs be denied such relief as is now available? The commendable 
effort of the State to remedy the situation serves to emphasize the importance
of the present inequalities. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: I think you will find some language in the Sipuel case, if I remember rightly, about &quot;personal and present.&quot; </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: That was the admission into the school in Oklahoma. 
I think that language is in the Sipuel case. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: I mean &quot;personal and present.&quot; </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Well, there it was proper, I state, because there is quite a distinction 
between higher education and facilities that can or cannot be offered on a higher 
educational level as compared with the common school level; and the court—our contention 
is that the lower court, the inferior court, the court of chancery—was in error when it thought that it was compelled to issue the kind of decree it 
did without giving any regard to the public interest and to the parties involved. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Your court says in the opinion: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To require the plaintiffs to 
wait another year— </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am reading at page 58— </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>—under present conditions would be in effect partially to deny them that to which 
we have held they are entitled. It is possible that a case might occur in which 
completion of equalization of facilities might be so imminent as to justify a different result, but we do 
not pass on that question because it is not presented. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether that is discretion—your position is that they are bound under the Sipuel 
case to give immediate relief; they thought they were bound to give immediate—
</p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Yes, they thought they were bound. MR. JUSTICE REED: To give immediate 
relief. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Yes, that is correct. </p>
<p>In the light of what I have read from the amicus curiae brief, when it was urged 
that the Court should be slow in desegregating even where segregation per se was 
held to be invalid, our contention is that the fact that it is even more serious where the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine is held to be valid, and where it is recognized that the State, upon a showing that any existing inequality relating to facilities 
and educational opportunities is capable of being corrected within a reasonable 
time, for a court to compel the immediate amalgamation of Negroes and whites in 
the same school, and then later, upon a showing of equalization, 
again separate the Negro children from the white school—a decree requiring the defendants to equalize the facilities within a reasonable time would give 
the plaintiffs relief as quickly as practicable, consistent with an orderly administration of the school system and a specific adjustment 
of inequalities where such inequalities have been found to exist in the past.
</p>
<p>The same situation occurred in the Virginia case and also in the South Carolina 
case, perhaps not with the finding that Your Honors find to exist in the opinion 
of the Chancellor in the lower court, but I believe that the language of— </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: The language can be found in the Virginia case, can 
it not? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Not that particular finding that segregation of and by itself under 
the evidence is harmful. I think that they did— </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: They had findings there that it was not equal. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That it was not equal, that is correct; and I believe there was some 
comment, as I recall, that whether it does harm or does not do harm is not for the 
Court to determine. But this is what Judge Parker had to say in disposing of the 
case, the South Carolina case: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is argued that, because the school facilities furnished Negroes in District No. 22 are inferior to those furnished white persons, 
we should enjoin segregation rather than direct the equalizing of conditions. Inasmuch 
as we think that the law requiring segregation is valid, however, and that the inequality suffered by plaintiffs results, not from the 
law, but from the way it has been administered, we think that our injunction should 
be directed to removing the inequalities resulting from administration within the 
framework of the law rather than to nullifying the law itself. As a court of equity, 
we should exercise our power to assure to plaintiffs the equality of treatment to which they are entitled with due regard to the legislative policy of the State. In directing that the school facilities 
afforded Negroes within the district be equalized promptly with those afforded white 
persons, we are giving plaintiffs all the relief that they can reasonably ask and 
the relief that is ordinarily granted in cases of this sort. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Court, as it was said in the Briggs case, should not use its power to abolish 
segregation in a State where it is required by the constitution and laws of the 
State if the equality demanded by the Constitution can be attained otherwise. This 
much, the court went on to say, is demanded by the spirit of comity which must prevail 
in the relationship between the agencies of the Federal Government and the State if our constitutional system is to endure. </p>
<p>What we ask in this case is that the Delaware Supreme Court&#39;s judgment be reversed 
and that the Delaware Supreme Court be instructed that affording reasonable time 
for the board of education to correct inequalities capable of being corrected, as we have shown, is not 
in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Mr. Attorney General, may I trouble you again? Has the 
supreme court, your supreme court in terms, not as a necessary consequence of what 
it has decided but has your supreme court in terms taken the position that if the 
Chancellor finds inequality then the immediate opening of the doors of schools of 
whites who have no segregation in schools is legal compulsion? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is, we contend, the position the supreme court took. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Has it taken that in terms? Here is what troubles me. 
It is asking a great deal of this Court, for one-ninth of this Court, to overrule 
the judgment of the Chancellor, affirmed by the supreme court of the State, that the equity of the situation 
requires the decree that they entered. If they base that on their interpretation 
of what the decisions of this Court require, then it was not the Chancellor&#39;s exercise of discretion, but it was a result 
caused by the requirement that they must follow the decisions of the Court. As I 
read their opinions, they did not say that in terms, did they? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: No, but the general mandate, it would seem to me the blanket mandate, 
in affirming the judgment of the court or chancery or the Chancellor— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Did the Chancellor think that was the thing to do?
</p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: He thought so, yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That as soon as inequality is shown, then at once there 
must be— </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: How could he? We did not do that in one of the cases. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: We tried to point out to the Chancellor that 
he was wrong, and we tried to point out to the Chancellor that that was not so. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: The question is whether he was wrong or what rule of 
law did he apply. If he said that in this situation, considering the circumstances in Delaware, your county or school district—or 
he may not have been explicit about it—that is one thing. If he says that the Supreme 
Court demands, &quot;and I am an obedient judge,&quot; that is another thing. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: He said where there is an injury, as he found such to be here, then 
the injury should be redressed immediately. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Well, that may be his view as an equity judge. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: But he based it on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: If I may say so, a chancellor who shows as much competence 
as this opinion shows probably can read the opinions of this Court with understanding.
</p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: There is no question about the Chancellor&#39;s competency, Your Honor. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: If I may say so, it was an unusual opinion, as opinions go. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: May I read from just the opinion of the Chancellor on page 203, at the bottom of the page: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Just what is the effect of such a finding of a violation of the Constitution, 
as has here been made. It is true that in such a situation some courts have merely 
directed the appropriate state officials to equalize facilities. I do not believe that such is the relief 
warranted by a finding that the United States Constitution has been violated. It 
seems to me that when a plaintiff shows to the satisfaction of a court that there 
is an existing and continuing violation of the `separate but equal&#39; doctrine, he is entitled to have made available to 
him the state facilities which have been shown to be superior. To do otherwise is 
to say to such a plaintiff: `Yes, your constitutional rights are being invaded, 
but be patient, we will see whether in time they are still being violated.&#39; 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Judge Parker had that problem before him in the South Carolina case, and 
the same problem was there in the Virginia case. But is it a violation that is going 
to continue upon a showing that we, the State, are able and willing to correct the 
existing inequalities between the two races? </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Suppose your supreme court had said that, &quot;It is our 
view that when a violation of the Constitution is shown, that is such an overriding equity that we regard the inconvenience 
or the difficulties to the State as subordinate to that overriding equity.&quot; That 
would be a view of equity, the balancing of considerations by the local court, and not at all derived from the necessities 
of the Fourteenth Amendment? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: I agree with Your Honor. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I was wondering whether that is not really implicit 
in these decisions. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: I do not believe so. I think that they were fully cognizant of the 
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that they were aware of the South Carolina case at the time, the Virginia 
case, and that the leading cases, the Sweatt case and, of course, the Gaines case, 
and it was on that basis that they felt that they were compelled to make the kind 
of order— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Automatically because there was a violation of the Fourteenth 
Amendment, and the Fourteenth Amendment requires automatic redress; that is your 
view of it? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is right, precisely. That is our view, and I think it is borne 
out by a reading of the two opinions in the court of chancery and in the Delaware 
Supreme Court. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Mr. Attorney General, I call your attention to page 204(a), as I understand it, of the Chancellor&#39;s opinion, and towards the bottom he says, &quot;If it be a matter of discretion, I reach the same conclusion.&quot; </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Well, I think that is the language in the opinion; but it is clear 
that the decision rested— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: He thought to the contrary, too. He also said that if it is 
a matter of discretion, &quot;I reach the same conclusion.&quot; </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: But he did reach the conclusion upon the basis and the interpretation 
of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that is the way 
the Delaware Supreme Court found that he ruled, and thought that it was proper because 
it was a matter of compulsion where there is such a finding. </p>
<p>I want to say, of course, there was much more that I would <a name="page23">
</a>like to have brought to the Court&#39;s attention. I know it 
would be impossible for me to review the cases on the question of segregation
per se that were so ably presented by my distinguished colleagues. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: In addition to that, your time has expired. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is true. Is it at an end now? </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: Yes. 
</p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Thank you. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OF LOUIS L. REDDING, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>In this fifth and last case before the Court on this subject, the fundamental 
question is still the same as in the four preceding cases; namely, what rights has 
the individual to protection against arbitrary action by government? </p>
<p>In four cases, including the Delaware case, the government involved is the state government; in the fifth case, the government involved is the Federal 
Government. </p>
<p>This case differs from the other cases in that the persons who were originally 
plaintiffs appear here not as appellants but as respondents. Judgment in the trial court was rendered for the persons who were originally 
plaintiffs, and that judgment, as well as a finding of fact that there was substantial 
inequality in facilities, was affirmed by the state supreme court. </p>
<p>Now, that affirmance was not merely a formal affirmance. The state supreme court 
concluded that because a constitutional question was involved, that is, a question 
involving the constitution of the State of Delaware was involved, it had a right to completely disregard the findings of fact of the Chancellor and make its own independent 
findings of fact, and it did so, and it sustained the Chancellor&#39;s findings of fact that there was substantial inequality in physical 
facilities. </p>
<p>The Chancellor made a second finding of fact. He made a finding of fact which, 
in language, is something like this—and I think, perhaps, I had better refer to 
the exact language: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I conclude from the testimony that in our Delaware society, state-imposed segregation in education itself results in the Negro children, 
as a class, receiving educational opportunities which are substantially inferior 
to those available to white children otherwise similarly situated. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the respondents here say, first of all, just as has been said in the four 
preceding cases, that classification on the basis of race to determine what educational 
facilities may be enjoyed is arbitrary and unreasonable, and because it is arbitrary 
and unreasonable, it is unconstitutional. We say that such a classification has no relationship 
to the education of a State&#39;s citizens. </p>
<p>Now, there has been some discussion arising, I think in part, from questions 
from Your Honors as to the basis for the type of legislation that is here under 
attack. I cannot answer what the basis for this type of legislation in other states was, but I should like to indicate 
what I think the basis was in Delaware. </p>
<p>Delaware has never, by the normal process of ratification, ratified the Fourteenth 
Amendment. The only ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment which has occurred 
in Delaware is a ratification by implication from judicial action. </p>
<p>When the Fourteenth Amendment was being circulated among the states for ratification, 
the Delaware legislature, in joint session, concurred in a joint resolution, the words of which I shall read: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whereas, this General Assembly believes the adoption of the said proposed Amendment 
to the Constitution would have a tendency to destroy the rights of the states in 
their sovereign capacity as states, would be an attempt to establish an equality not sanctioned 
by the laws of nature or of God, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>therefore they refused to ratify. </p>
<p>Now, this is not an isolated action. That action was taken in March of 1869, 
and it is found recorded in 13 Laws of Delaware 256. This is not an isolated action. 
The legislature took the same action with respect to the Fifteenth Amendment. In 
language which is as follows, it stated: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is resolved that the members of this General Assembly do hereby declare their unqualified disapproval of said Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and hereby 
refuse to adopt and ratify the same. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say it is not isolated, and I refer to still another resolution if Your Honors 
will indulge me. This resolution was unanimously adopted by a joint session of the 
Delaware legislature, and I think its language will be self-explanatory: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Resolved, that the members of this General Assembly do hereby declare uncompromising 
opposition to a proposed act of Congress introduced by the Honorable Charles Sumner 
  at the last session and now on file in the Senate of the United States, known as the Supplemental Civil Rights bill, and all other measures intended or calculated to equalize 
the Negro race with the white race, politically or socially, and especially do they 
proclaim unceasing opposition to making Negroes eligible to public offices, to sit on juries, and to their admission into public schools 
where white children attend, to their admission on terms of equality with white 
people in churches, public conveyances, places of amusement or hotels, and to any and every measure designed or having the effect to promote 
the equality of the Negro with the white man in any of the relationships of life.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We say, sirs, that that is the background of this legislation. </p>
<p>However, Delaware did not include in its state constitution a requirement that 
there be separation of Negroes and whites in public schools until 1897, the year 
after this Court decided Plessy v. Ferguson. Apparently, the Delaware legislation, 
which passed the amendment of the Delaware constitution—it was amended by two successive 
legislatures—apparently the Delaware legislature felt that there was warrant in 
Plessy v. Ferguson for a so-called &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. </p>
<p>Now, we think that these resolutions indicate that this separation of the Negro and white in public schools was not based on any rational consideration. 
At the trial of the case evidence was introduced further to show that such legislation 
was not based on any rational or reasonable grounds. </p>
<p>I should like the indulgence of the Court to call attention to this testimony 
at page 122 of the appendix of the appellees, plaintiffs below. Doctor Otto Klineberg, a professor of psychology at Columbia University, 
was testifying. He was asked this question— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: What was the page, please? </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: I am sorry, sir; page 122 of the thick blue book. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dr. Klineberg, are there differences in inborn intellectual capacity among individuals which are determined by whether an individual
is Negro or white? </p>
  <p>A. No. There are, of course, differences in intellectual capacity, but we have 
no scientific evidence that those differences are determined in any way by the racial 
origin of the individual. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think that completely removes any possibility of a contention that this legislation today, with the advances in scientific knowledge about 
the measurement of mental capacities of human beings today, could have any rational 
basis. </p>
<p>Now, the Delaware statute provides for separate but equal education for Negroes 
and whites. The form of the statute itself predetermined the nature of the action; 
that is, these plaintiffs felt that they were required to show that there was not 
equality although there was separation, and they attempted to do it on two bases: They showed inequality 
of physical facilities, and they got a finding of fact from the Chancellor, which 
was sustained by the supreme court, on that; and then they attempted to show inequality
flowing from the harm done by segregation on the individual student. I might 
say that twelve expert witnesses testified with respect to this second aspect of inequality. </p>
<p>I should like to call the attention of the Court to just a small portion of that 
testimony. I should like to call the Court&#39;s attention to the testimony of a witness whom the Chancellor characterized in his opinion as one of America&#39;s foremost psychiatrists. This witness was not 
testifying merely from abstractions of scientific knowledge. This witness had examined, among other Delawareans, some of the respondents in this case, and, as a result of his learning and as 
a result of this examination, this witness testified as follows, at page 76 of this same book, which is the transcript of the testimony. Dr. Fredric Wertham testified: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, the fact of segregation in public and high school creates in the mind of 
the child an unsolvable conflict, an unsolvable emotional conflict, and I would 
say an inevitable conflict—it is inevitable that it cause such a conflict. This conflict is, in the child&#39;s mind, what a foreign body is in the child&#39;s 
body. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, Doctor Wertham testified that segregation, state-imposed segregation, created an important inequality in educational opportunities for the various reasons. He said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, of course, these facts that I have mentioned are not caused only by the school segregation, but the school segregation is important, of paramount importance, for a number of reasons. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BURTON</b>: Where is that? </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: This—I am sorry, Your Honor—is at page 86 of <a name="page27">
</a>this same transcript of testimony. He says: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is of paramount importance for a number of reasons. In the first place, it is absolutely clear cut. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, he says, the State does it; thirdly, it is not just the discrimination, 
it is discrimination of very long duration; it is continuous; and fourth, it is bound up with the whole educational process. </p>
<p>Now, sirs, I say that the Chancellor&#39;s finding of fact with respect to the harm done in Delaware society by state-imposed segregation on the minds of these children is based on that testimony. </p>
<p>Some discussion has been had as to what the Supreme Court of Delaware did with 
that finding of the Chancellor. It is our view that the supreme court did not reject 
that finding. It is our view that that finding survives; and because we have that 
view, and because the supreme court, in our view, did not give legal effectuation to a finding of fact made by the trial court, we ask that this Court give legal 
effectuation to such a finding. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Aren&#39;t you really asking that the decree below be affirmed?
</p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: We ask, of course, that the decree below be affirmed; but we ask that it be affirmed not merely for the reason given by the Supreme 
Court of Delaware, but for other considerations which this Court has taken into account in, for example, the Sipuel case and 
the McLaurin case. </p>
<p>In those cases this Court did take into account factors like the isolation of 
the student from other students. The Delaware Supreme Court did not take that into account, and in affirming the opinion of the Delaware 
Supreme Court, we respectfully ask that this Court take those factors into account 
and grant a judgment of affirmance which will indicate that segregation in and of 
itself inflicts inequalities of educational opportunities on the respondents here, so that no matter what attempt to equalize facilities may be made by the 
Attorney General of the State of Delaware, there will still be inequality of educational 
opportunity which the State is not correcting. </p>
<p>We think that in the Sweatt case— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: If we just affirmed this decree below without an opinion, 
that would be an end of the matter, and the plaintiffs in this case would get all 
they asked, would they not? </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: No, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: They would be admitted into the school into which they 
wanted to be admitted. </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: They ask for the equality of educational opportunity. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is what they would get if the decree was affirmed.
</p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: They would get it, sir; but they would get it under the shadow of the threat of the Attorney General that the moment he has shown to the court that facilities are equalized they would then be ejected 
from the schools. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: Was it the threat of the Attorney General or was that the condition stated by the Court? </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: Well, the Attorney General now threatens that, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: I say though— </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: I say that is the explanation of his appearance here. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: —isn&#39;t that what the court said? </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: Yes, 
the court said that. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: And he held that it would be contingent and motions 
might be made if conditions were changed. </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: We think that— </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: Isn&#39;t that what the court said? MR. REDDING: That is 
correct, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Did the court say that they would exclude those children 
if new arrangements were made? Did the court say what they would do if in the future 
an application were made to deal with this decree? They simply let the decree open. Almost every decree in equity is left open. </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: That is correct, sir. But we have no reason to believe that the 
court at that time will not take the same position with respect to its limitation 
that it took originally. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Mr. Redding, we have had cases where we had to dismiss 
a case as moot because the child had gone through the education, a case from New 
Jersey, and it was a case in a totally different field—so that by the time there 
may be a new threat, these boys and girls might be in various universities of the 
country. </p>
<p><b>MR. REDDING</b>: We feel, sir, that the decree should be affirmed.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OF JACK GREENBERG, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: If it please the Court: </p>
<p>We are seeking affirmance of the judgment below. In addition to the reasons submitted by Mr. Redding, which, we submit, will permanently settle 
respondents&#39; right to the relief which they sought, and settle on the basis of the 
really important factors present in this case, we submit that the judgment rendered below should at least be affirmed 
for the reasons given by the court below. </p>
<p>The court below found that the State was offering education to respondents inferior 
to education offered white children similarly situated. The petitioners, on page four of their petition for certiorari, expressly 
disclaim any challenge to this finding of inequality. </p>
<p>To give the Court an idea of the degree of the more measurable inequalities present in this case, I had merely intended to mention a few of 
them; but since the Attorney General has taken them up in detail, I should like 
to, for a moment, go through our brief where they are listed on pages 27 through 
41, and outline them rapidly so that the Court will have an idea of the severe degree
of the inequality. </p>
<p>There is travel, and the significance of travel, as testified to by a psychologist, 
who indicated that travel has important consequences for the learning process, that it induces fatigue and irritability and takes up valuable portions of the child&#39;s time when he could be engaged in 
self-initiated activity that is very important to the learning process. </p>
<p>There were inequalities in sites and buildings, and inequalities in teacher preparation, 
and there was inequality in teacher load, which the Attorney General did not bring 
out. </p>
<p>We contended there were inequalities in curricula and extra-curricular activities; there was no finding that these were equal, but we submit, and the 
Supreme Court of Delaware found that, perhaps, they were <i>de minimis</i>, and nothing 
to be taken into account in a case of this sort; and it is our contention, concerning inequalities of, 
perhaps, this small nature, that a child should not be submitted to them merely 
because of his race. </p>
<p>There were inequalities in the elementary school case in sites and buildings, 
which the Attorney General brought out; in instructional materials and accessories, which the Attorney General brought out; there were 
inequalities in relative expenditures for schools 29 and 107, which I do not believe 
were brought out; and, very important, there were inequalities in teaching in 
the cases. The teachers in the Negro elementary school were not as well trained 
and were not as highly rated by the county supervisor, who had rated them as B 
teachers, whereas he had rated the teachers in the white schools as A teachers. </p>
<p>So, we submit that the palpable, perhaps the more measurable, inequalities in this case are of a very severe and extensive nature. </p>
<p>The Attorney General expressed willingness in both courts below, and he expresses 
it in this Court, to accept the decree ordering the State to equalize the schools in question. But, as was pointed out in a portion 
of the Chancellor&#39;s opinion which was read here before, the Chancellor wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This would be to say, `Yes, your constitutional rights are being invaded, but be patient, we will see whether in time they are 
still being invaded.&#39; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chancellor cited Sweatt against Painter for this proposition, and he ruled that respondents were entitled to relief immediately in the only way that relief was available; namely, by admission to the schools with the superior facilities, and he wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To postpone relief would be to deny relief. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed on this express ground. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Is it your position that the court, finding </p>
<p>a right being denied, has no power to take into consideration the time that it 
will take to correct it? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: It is our position, Your Honor, that if constitutional rights are being denied our respondents, they are entitled to those rights as quickly as those rights can be made available; and in this case they could be made available most quickly by admission to the 
superior facilities—that is, without regard to the other factors that have been 
discussed in the other cases. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: You do not agree with the Attorney General&#39;s suggestion, 
then? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: No. It is our position, for example, that if the State guarantees 
a child ten years of education, and the child has spent approximately five of those 
years in inferior schools, and it is possible to give him the remaining five years 
on a parity with white students, that to deny him the sixth, seventh and eighth 
years of equality is to inflict an irreparable injury on him. Those three years 
cannot be completely recaptured, and we feel there is no reason in justice or under the Fourteenth Amendment 
why we should not demand it. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: When you say there is no reason in justice, of course— </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: And under the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: When you say that the Attorney General&#39;s plan for a gradual correction of this situation is impossible, it has to be done 
all at once? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: That is our view. First of all, it does not afford the right; and, second of all, as I intend to come to in a moment, there is no showing on this record, no showing whatsoever, and both courts so 
found, there is no evidence that equality would occur at any time in the future.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: What is there in the Constitution which prevents a chancellor from taking into consideration the consequences of 
a decree in cases involving constitutional rights or any other rights? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: There is nothing in the Constitution one way or another on the 
question. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: He behaved the way a chancellor should behave, in the way of balancing the public interest on one side as against 
an immediate relief on the other? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: But there is no showing of any public interest— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is a different story. A chancellor has no business 
not to enforce a right which he decrees in the ordinary property case— </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: I think that if a showing had been made on that point, something 
of that sort might be taken into consideration. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I was referring to the broader question that Justice 
Jackson raised by referring to the considerations of the Attorney General&#39;s previous answers, the whole broad problem of relief 
in these cases on the assumption that rights are involved. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: That is right, sir. </p>
<p>I would like to address myself to something close to that question, Your Honor. There have been questions apparently in this case and in other cases 
concerning the administrative problems that might be involved in the integration 
which was involved in these cases. As to this case, we can only say that the 
decree of the Supreme Court of Delaware came down, I believe, on August the 
28th, at which time both counsel for the respondents were on vacation; and before we could even return from vacation, the children who had read about the decree in the newspaper had applied to the schools and 
had been admitted, and there was no more administrative problem involved than admitting anybody else. I certainly heard of nothing unusual in this particular case that would indicate any serious 
administrative, or any administrative, difficulty. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Are you suggesting that on the broader issue there is 
no problem at all in just eliminating segregated school systems throughout the country, no problem at all? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: Of course, there may be a problem, but in this case there was 
no problem, and in fact no problem whatsoever. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Then there is no occasion for not doing what the Delaware 
court did? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: As far as administrative problems are concerned, I see no problem. </p>
<p>The Attorney General&#39;s contention that the schools can be equalized within one 
year does not take several factors into account. The first one is, how the Wilmington School Board, which is not a party to this 
case, and which would have to equalize the Howard School in question, can be compelled 
to equalize the Howard School, since it is not a party to the case. The Court of 
Chancery and the Supreme Court of Delaware both know that they could not order the 
Wilmington Board to do anything to which it was not a party. And the Attorney General 
in his petition for certiorari and also in his argument nowhere indicated how Delaware
courts of equity could administer the type of decree which he said that they 
should have handed down, as both the Court of Chancery, which would have to administer 
such a decree, and the Supreme Court of Delaware have ruled that they cannot engage 
in the sort of business which he wants them to become involved in. </p>
<p>I read from page 57 of the thin blue book, at the end: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>. . . it is difficult to see how a court of equity could effectively supervise 
and direct the expenditure of state funds in a matter committed to the sound administrative discretion of the school authorities. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chancellor wrote similarly that he did not see how he could order the State 
to put into effect the equalization which the Attorney General suggests this Court should order the State 
to do. </p>
<p>A reference to the pages of the record to which the Attorney General referred 
for his assertion that equality will occur sometime in the future does not reveal that there is any likelihood of equality at all 
in the future. Both courts below found no likelihood of future equality. </p>
<p>The court of chancery wrote on page 352 of this thick white book: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I do not see how the plans mentioned will remove all the objections to the present arrangement. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on page 353: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I conclude that the State&#39;s future plans do not operate to prevent the granting 
of relief to these plaintiffs . . . </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on page 356, he indicated that the same considerations applied to the elementary 
school cases. I was talking about the high school cases in the other two. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Delaware likewise noted that the Attorney General had proffered no evidence whatsoever of future equalization, and he noted 
that claims of equality would have to be judged when made in the future. That is 
on page 58 of the thin blue book. </p>
<p>So the Attorney General&#39;s request for a decree ordering equalization is based upon a factual premise that such equalization will occur at some ascertainable 
time in the future, and it is nowhere supported in the record in either of the opinions 
of the courts below. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: You mean to say that the record does not show about the construction of the new high school, costing a million 
and a quarter dollars, that the Attorney General referred to? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: Yes, Your Honor. It showed that a new high school is being constructed. 
That high school is thirty miles south of where respondents live, in the high school 
case; and it nowhere indicates what effect that high school will have upon the future 
education of respondents. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: Does it consider the additions at Howard, and how they 
would be ready for use next September? Is that in the record, or is the Attorney 
General speaking out of the record? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: There is a stipulation, Your Honor, which I will quote in full, and I think it will thoroughly answer your question. The stipulation is on page 36 of the clipped-in portion of the thin blue book, 
and Item 3 of that stipulation states: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The present schedule of the Wilmington Board of Education calls for a transfer 
of grades seven, eight and nine of the Howard High School to the Bancroft School 
and the closing down of the Carver School at the beginning of the school year in September, 1953. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: Is there anything about the additional facilities at Howard? We were told that there is quite a bit of it, and that 
that would be ready in September. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: I think, in justice to the Attorney General, I can take the petition 
for certiorari and refer to every record reference that he gives. On page five of his petition for certiorari, speaking of future 
equalization, he refers first to pages R-36 and 57, which are in the clipped-in 
portion of this thin blue book. On page R-36 is Item 3, which we just read. On page 
57, there is the statement that the court held: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As to the Howard-Carver buildings, plans have been approved for the transfer 
of the junior high school pupils at Howard to another junior high school, for the enlargement of the Howard building, with additional 
equipment, and for the closing of Carver and the transfer of its pupils to Howard. It is 
said that all these changes are expected to be completed by September 1953, and 
that they will completely equalize the Howard facilities. It is also shown that plans are under way to 
build a modern high school for Negroes in Middletown, New Castle County. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is our item. I might say that this nowhere takes into account contemplated future changes at the Claymont School, and the record indicates 
a very fast expansion program is under way there. </p>
<p>He then refers in that same paragraph to page 57, which I read; and then he refers 
to page A-312, which is page 312 of the thick white book. George Miller, who was 
State Superintendent of Education, stated: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The construction program in New Castle County provides for a four-year high school 
in Middletown which is under way now, and we are just waiting for materials until 
that is completed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it nowhere indicates what effect that will have. This 
is thirty miles south of where respondents live. It in no way indicates what effect 
that will have on respondents&#39; education. </p>
<p>He then, in the elementary school case, refers to pages R-59 to 62, where it 
is stated that until recently the white elementary school was favored in the receipt 
of public funds, and that that inequality has been eliminated; and on page 62, there 
is the statement that, speaking of the fact that the inequality of funds had been eliminated:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The burden was clearly upon the defendants to show the extent to which the remedial 
legislation had improved conditions or would improve them in the near future. This the defendants failed to do. It is natural to suppose that with the equality of funds, any substantial
disparities will shortly be eliminated; but we must take the record as it was 
made below. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that only refers to the equalization of teachers in the two schools. It does 
not refer to any other disparities. </p>
<p>As Mr. Redding indicated, Your Honor, it is our contention in this case that 
from the Attorney General&#39;s position in this case and from the express provision 
in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Delaware, this litigation is open to resegregate 
those plaintiffs at any time that the physical facilities, they believe, may become 
equalized. </p>
<p>Now, if the physical facilities were all that were involved in this case, it 
would be our contention that this merely might be another unfortunate burden that these respondents have to bear solely because of their race. But where the record proves that the injury from which the right flows will exist in segregated schools so long as segregated 
schools exist, we submit that this Court should recognize these facts and assure 
the respondents&#39; admission permanently. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Do you say that the record shows that? What are you depending 
upon? The findings? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: We are depending upon the findings and the evidence upon which 
the findings were made. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Do you take the position that the findings affect the matter generally, or only in Delaware? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: The findings expressly refer to Delaware, Your Honor, in our Delaware 
society. As to the other states, I have read the record in some of these other states, 
and there is similar evidence. But speaking of the Delaware case, the findings
refer to Delaware specifically, and indeed, by our witnesses there was a very 
heavy emphasis upon the fact that these Delaware children were examined by one of America&#39;s most eminent psychiatrists, and by psychologists. An ex-head of the Delaware Psychological Association testified for us. The head of the sociology department of the University of Delaware testified for us. A professor of education at the University of Delaware testified for us. It was all to the 
effect that in Delaware society, this is the effect. 
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Is that what you are limiting this part of your argument to, 
that on the basis of cases of this kind and the findings of fact based on oral testimony, 
it may be expected, under the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, to show that there is an inferiority in educational 
opportunity in one community where there might not be in another? </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: Yes, Your Honor, that is part of what you might call a three-pronged 
attack. But that is only one part of it. We also contend, of course, that the classification 
is entirely unreasonable. But we are urging all the reasons we can for affirmance of the judgment below, and that is one of the reasons. </p>
<p>So as I said, in the doctrine announced in the case of Helvering v. Lerner Stores, which is in our brief at page eleven, we urge these additional 
reasons for affirmance of the judgment below. We urge again that this Court recognize 
the unreasonableness of the classification involved in this case, and also that 
this Court adopt as its own the factual finding of the Chancellor that state-imposed
segregation in Delaware society injures the Negro child. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: How can we do that? The Supreme Court says that we are not going to review that. That means that we must take 
the testimony of Doctor Fredric Wertham, for whom I have a great respect, and say 
that his testimony, his appraisal and his judgment, are like mathematical pronouncements, and there they are.
</p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: Well, Your Honor, there are several things involved. It is a very 
full and completely uncontradicted record. Secondly, there was a thorough review 
by the Chancellor. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: But the testimony of a witness is subject to intrinsic 
limitations and qualifications and illuminations. The mere fact that a man is not contradicted does not mean that what he says 
is so. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: As far as that is concerned, the Chancellor— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: If a man says three yards, and I have measured it and 
it is three yards, there it is. But if a man tells you the inside of your brain and mine, and how we 
function, that is not a measurement, and there you are. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: That is true, Your Honor. But it is our contention that as far as the value to be placed upon the facts, the trial judge was able 
to see and hear the witness, and that is certainly in the record. The Chancellor saw him. Now, as far as the record is concerned, 
Your Honors are as free to review that record as the Supreme Court of Delaware. 
They cannot recapture the mood and the word of the witness, either, and this bears 
on a constitutional right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I do not know about that. They are dealing with Delaware 
conditions. They are dealing with situations that they know about. It makes a lot 
of difference, whether you have two so-called minority children in a group of twenty 
or two out of fifty or ten out of forty. Those are all local conditions, as to which 
the Supreme Court of Delaware has some knowledge, having lived there and thought 
about these things. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: All we can say is that whatever consideration was given to the 
matter by the Delaware court, all added up to the fact that segregation injured 
these children. And as far as what I assume Your Honor is referring to, I assume 
Your Honor is referring to what other counsel has referred to, the untoward effects of the abolition 
of segregation. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I am not referring to anything, except that we are here 
in a domain which I do not yet regard as science in the sense of mathematical certainty. 
This is all opinion evidence. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: That is true, Your Honor. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I do not mean that I disrespect it. I simply know its 
character. It can be a very different thing from, as I say, things that are weighed 
and measured and are fungible. We are dealing here with very subtle things, very subtle testimony. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: Our only answer to that is that to the extent that it did receive 
a review below, and to the extent that the Chancellor was able to view these witnesses, and to the extent that the cross-examination 
affected their testimony, and to the extent that the Supreme Court of Delaware felt 
that the abolition of segregation would have any untoward effect, none of that weakens this testimony at all, because 
in fact segregation was abolished as far as these particular children were concerned, 
and they are now attending the schools. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I do not mean to raise the question of testimony. All I am saying is that I do not have a record such as I would 
have if I merely had the Chancellor&#39;s findings, or if the supreme court had said, 
&quot;We agree with the Chancellor.&quot; </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: I agree that if more people had reviewed this— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Not more; the very simple fact, the fact that the supreme 
court said, inasmuch as we deem this immaterial, we do not review it, and therefore 
we have merely a finding of an intermediate court, as to which I know not what the 
highest court of Delaware would have said if they had reviewed it. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Did you say that the children are now attending these schools?
</p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: That is right, sir. They registered from the beginning of the 
semester. I thought I mentioned that the decree— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: I thought the argument was that they could not get in, that 
it would disrupt the schools. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: The Attorney General of Delaware applied for a stay of execution, 
but it was not granted to him. One of the reasons was that he applied too late, 
and another reason was that to grant the stay would be inconsistent with the mandate.
</p>
<p>And so, for the reasons that Mr. Redding has submitted, and particularly for 
those reasons, because we feel that our respondents&#39; rights can be more fully protected and more permanently protected in that way, 
we urge that this Court affirm the judgment below, and assure that the respondents&#39; stay in the schools to which they have 
been admitted and which they are now attending will be one unharassed by future litigation and attempts to segregate them once

<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: No. 10, <i>Francis B. Gebhart, et al.</i>, v. <i>Ethel Louise

<p><b>THE CLERK</b>: Counsel are present. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Mr. Young? </p>
<p align="center"><b>OPENING ARGUMENT OF <br>
H. ALBERT YOUNG, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: The petitioners in this case, Your Honors, seek review of final judgments 
of the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware affirming orders of the Court of Chancery. 
The petitioners are members of the Board of Education of the State of Delaware, 
and the boards of the Claymont Special School District and the Hockessin School 
District. The provision from which the petitioners seek relief is the same in both 
cases: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That the defendants, and each of them, are enjoined from denying to infant plaintiffs 
and others similarly situated, because of colored ancestry, admittance to the public 
schools. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the court of chancery the respondents urged the proposition that segregation 
in and of itself is contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment and prayed for a declaratory 
judgment to that effect. The petitioners appealed from other rulings of the chancellor 
which enjoined the petitioners from refusing admittance to the plaintiffs to schools 
maintained for white children. The basis of these rulings was that the physical 
and educational facilities of the schools maintained for Negro children were inferior. 
Simultaneously, the respondents appealed from the denial of a declaratory judgment, 
and the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the decrees of the chancellor. </p>
<p>The petitioners applied for certiorari to this Court on the narrow issue, namely, 
the type of relief which should have been granted, the form and shape of the decree, 
and asked for an opportunity to equalize the facilities. The respondents did not 
file a cross petition, nor did they seek any review of the decision that 
segregation in and of itself is not contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>The basic question, then, of segregation <i>per se</i> is, therefore, not before this 
Court in the Delaware case; but the respondents, however, take a different view, 
and because of this position taken by the respondents and the importance of the 
questions raised, and the wishes of this Court, and a sense of duty, we have attempted 
to answer the questions that are posed to counsel. </p>
<p>There is no evidence that Delaware refused to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment 
because of a belief that it would require the State to admit Negroes into its public 
schools on a mixed basis. The respondents draw from the historical facts in Delaware 
the remarkable conclusion that the General Assembly, in a series of discriminatory 
statutes, demonstrated that it fully understood that equality before the law demanded 
nonsegregation, and that school segregation in Delaware is based upon white superiority. 
A few important facts, taken out of the pages of history from the State of Delaware, 
will throw some light on its position with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment and 
segregated schools. </p>
<p>Delaware did not secede from the Union, nor did it join the Confederacy. Its 
geographical position alone was sufficient to assure Delaware&#39;s loyalty to the 
Union. Its situation on the Wilmington-Philadelphia-Baltimore Railroad and the Delaware 
Railroad, along which troops could be moved south, and on the Delaware River, controlled 
by the Union fleet which lay off Hampton Roads in Virginia, would have made resistance 
hopeless. In addition, the material prosperity of the State had become increasingly 
dependent upon Northern markets. Reinforcing the material ties was a long Delaware 
tradition of loyalty to the Constitution, and pride in having been the first State 
to ratify it. </p>
<p>Delaware&#39;s adherence, however, to the Union cause was a reluctant one. Attempts 
to obtain from the legislature a resolution of adherence to the Union failed. There 
were many manifestations of Southern sympathies throughout the State, throughout 
the war, and although slave-owning was clearly on the decline, particularly in Wilmington 
and other sections of New Castle County, one of the three counties of the State 
of Delaware, and although a vast majority of the Negroes were no longer slaves, 
it was pretty clear that slavery was a part of the social and economic life of the 
citizens of the remaining two counties, Kent and Sussex, as it was a part of the 
lives of the citizens of the Southern states. </p>
<p>Throughout the Civil War, the Democrats maintained firm control of the State 
government. It proclaimed itself the White Man&#39;s Party, and was in power until 
the late eighties or early nineties. It disapproved of suffrage or political or social 
equality for Negroes. </p>
<p>The dominant mood in Delaware, both during and after the Civil War, was opposed 
to abolitionism and equality for the Negroes, and in our own state legislature, 
in a joint resolution of the house and senate opposing the Freedmen&#39;s Bureau Bill, 
the Civil Rights Bill, the Negro suffrage, we witnessed the expression of the feeling 
that equality cannot be sanctioned under the laws of God or nature; and Senator 
Saulsbury at that time stated that he was proud that his State was the last to abolish 
slavery. </p>
<p>The Thirteenth Amendment was unqualifiedly rejected by the legislature in 1865. 
The legislature expressed its unqualified disapproval of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth 
Amendments, and refused to adopt them in 1867 and 1869, respectively. After the 
passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, poll tax laws in Delaware, designed particularly 
to disfranchise the Negroes, were adopted with great effect. </p>
<p>In the meantime, Negroes&#39; education in Delaware had made small progress. In the 
Constitution of 1792, we provided for a public school system; in 1829 we provided 
for schools for white children by statute; and by the Constitution of 1831 we reaffirmed 
what we had said in our Constitution of 1792 and provided for a public school system. 
This was all before any consideration of the Fourteenth Amendment by the State of 
Delaware. </p>
<p>In 1875 there was a statute imposed upon Negro property holders, and the funds 
that were obtained were used to supply and furnish education to the Negroes through 
a Delaware Society for the Advancement of Negro Education. </p>
<p>It was in 1881, for the first time, that Delaware did make some appropriation 
from its treasury for the education of Negroes, but the provision was rather meager 
and rather inadequate; but it is significant that it was the first step and the 
first stride forward in helping the Negro in his education in the State of Delaware.
</p>
<p>In 1897 the Constitution that was rewritten and now under attack by our friends, 
and now in force in the State of Delaware, provided for segregated schools on an 
equal basis in the State of Delaware. That section reads as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to the income of investments of of the public school funds, the General 
Assembly shall make provision for the benefit of the free public schools which shall 
be equitably apportioned among the school districts of the State; provided, however, 
that in such apportionment no distinction shall be made on account of race or color, 
and separate schools for white and colored children shall be maintained. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the late eighties or early nineties, a political revolution took place in 
the State of Delaware. The Republicans began to be a serious threat to the control 
of the Democrats, who proclaimed themselves as the White Party. This was partly 
due to the activities and the financial contributions of a political adventurer, 
John Addicks by name, who was a wealthy stock manipulator from Pennsylvania, and, 
reading of the contest for the United States senatorship in 1889, came to Delaware 
and stated he was available, and because of his contributions to the party at that 
time, the Republicans got in control; and he also accomplished the enfranchisement 
of a great many of the Negroes by paying their poll tax. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: To an outsider it does not appear as one of the great 
social reforms of this country, does it? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is correct, Your Honor. </p>
<p>And by 1898 the Republican Party, through his efforts, however, had upset the 
Democratic control, so that the white supremacists in the State of Delaware had 
been overthrown. It was against this background that the Constitution of 1897, now 
in force, was adopted. It is evident that the constitutional provision and its statutory 
counterpart in Delaware were, in the cause of education of the Negroes, a long stride 
forward. </p>
<p>The attitude of the people of Delaware had undergone a change, for the slogan 
&quot;White Man&#39;s Party&quot; had finally lost its political potency, and the ineffaceable 
stamps of superiority were no longer present, and the doctrine of Negro inequality 
was no longer a guiding force in the framing of the statute. </p>
<p>The change may be said to have been formalized on February 12, 1901, when the 
Delaware legislature, without a dissenting vote, accepted and ratified the Thirteenth, 
Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. In Delaware, we ratified those three Civil 
War Amendments thirty years after they had been submitted for ratification. Thus, 
the argument of the respondents to the effect that school segregation in Delaware 
is based on the doctrine of white superiority is refuted. The resolutions about 
white superiority cited by the respondents in support of their argument belong to 
an era in Delaware history that had passed when the present school law and the present 
school system were enacted. </p>
<p>The constitutional provision for a separation of the races in the public schools 
in Delaware was not based upon any declaration of natural or God-made inequality 
or inferiority of the Negro. It was adopted in the light of the history and tradition 
of the people of the State of Delaware as the wisest and most workable and most 
acceptable method of educating the youth in that State, both white and colored. </p>
<p>Now, in answer to Question 1, I do not want to burden the Court—I know much argument 
has been presented—but it seems to me that in connection with Delaware&#39;s position, 
in order for the Court to obtain some idea of what the thinking was in the Congress 
at the time, I would like to touch upon some of the action and debates, although 
briefly, if I may, of Congress. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: May I ask a question whether there is any other case in the 
courts of Delaware? I should like to be informed. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: No, Your Honor. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Just for my information. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: This is the only case. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: This is the only case? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: This is the only case, the first case of its kind. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: We know nothing, then, as to the federal performance? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: No, this is the only case. </p>
<p>In attempting to evaluate the understanding of Congress, of course, we have got 
to consider the debate in Congress and the action of Congress, the action of Congress, 
for example, on the bill to enlarge the Freedmen&#39;s Bureau; the Civil Rights Act 
of 1866; the Fourteenth Amendment; and also the debates on the Civil Rights Act 
of 1875. </p>
<p>The debates in Congress on legislation of a similar character afford strong evidence 
that the Fourteenth Amendment was considered to have no effect on public school 
segregation. A majority of the Senate and House came from the states which had segregated 
school systems. I have no doubt that Senator Sumner and Representative Stevens wanted 
to include in the Fourteenth Amendment mixed schools for white children and colored 
children. </p>
<p>I have no doubt that those who opposed the Amendment attempted to stigmatize 
the bill, and made every effort they could to see to it that the Negroes received 
no rights, civil, political, or social; but I do believe that between the proponents 
of those measures and the opponents of those measures there was that responsible 
majority that saw the distinction between civil and political rights and social 
rights. </p>
<p>The members of Congress, I respectfully submit, would not have remained silent 
if they thought it would invalidate segregation in the schools in the states which 
they represented and which held to segregation of public education. The suggestions 
that it would do so came from the white supremacists who sought to stigmatize the 
bill; they sought to present a parade of horror to the existing state of public 
opinion, and their expressions should be taken cautiously. </p>
<p>Much has been said about the legislation in the District of Columbia at the time 
when they provided for a segregated school system and, at the same time, also abolished 
certain acts of discrimination, and did so both prior to any consideration of the 
Fourteenth Amendment, and also took up the question of the Negroes&#39; rights during 
a consideration of the Fourteenth Amendment, and after a consideration of the Fourteenth 
Amendment. But at no time did they change the system in the District of Columbia 
with respect to segregated schools. </p>
<p>Mr. Grimes or Senator Grimes of Iowa, in reporting the bill, had this to say 
in offering an amendment—and if Your Honors would permit me I would like to read 
from it because it illustrates that Congress did not sit by nor was Congress asleep, 
apparently, or that this act of providing segregated schools in the District of 
Columbia was not just a perfunctory or routine matter about which no one knew anything.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Grimes. Before the bill is read, I wish to propose some amendments on which 
the question can be taken altogether. In line 7 of section 9, after the word `the&#39; 
and before the word `taxable,&#39; I move to insert the word `white&#39;; in line 19 of 
section 9 before the word `inhabitants,&#39; insert the word `white&#39;; in line 30-3 of 
section 9, after the word `District,&#39; insert the words `owned by white persons.&#39;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so forth and so on; and then he concludes: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose is to make the bill conform to the view of the Committee—the bill 
was not printed in consonance with their views—and to confine the levy of taxes 
to white persons in the District, and to open the schools to the admission of white 
children. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does not seem likely that with this language, and with this introduction with 
respect to the provision for segregated schools in the District of Columbia, the 
window of the Republic at that time, that such equalitarians as Ben Wade of Ohio, 
and Senator Sumner and Senator Sprague, and Representative Stevens and all the other 
equalitarians would have sat by and said nothing. </p>
<p>The amendment was adopted, and another amendment was offered 
by Senator Grimes to provide separate schools for Negroes in the county, without 
any dissent; and it is interesting to know that these amendments were adopted without 
any opposition, even though 23 members of the 39th Congress that considered the 
Fourteenth Amendment served in the Senate at that time, and not a single member 
of the House raised his voice against segregation in schools in the District of 
Columbia. </p>
<p>In the 40th Congress no suggestion was made to abolish segregation in schools 
in the District of Columbia when a bill to transfer the duties of the trustees of 
the colored schools for the cities of Washington and Georgetown came under consideration, 
and this bill was passed after the Fourteenth Amendment was declared and ratified; 
and again, the 41st and 42nd Congresses, in those Congresses attempts were made 
to abolish segregation in the public schools, and in 1874, Congress reaffirmed its 
segregation policy in the District of Columbia. </p>
<p>It is hardly conceivable that the Congress which proposed the Fourteenth Amendment 
was attempting to prohibit the states a type of school which it had endorsed and 
failed or refused to change in the District of Columbia. </p>
<p>It is clear that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended, as contended by the 
respondents, to write into the Constitution the principle of absolute and complete 
equality so as to include the prohibition by the states against school segregation. 
Thaddeus Stevens realized that this notion of equality had not been achieved in 
the passage of the Amendment when, at the opening of the debate on the Fourteenth 
Amendment, he had this to say: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This proposition is not all that the Commission desired. It falls far short of 
my wishes. But it fulfills the present state of public opinion. Not only Congress 
but the several states are to be consulted. Upon a careful survey of the whole ground, 
we do not believe that 19 of the loyal states could be induced to ratify any proposition 
more stringent than this. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then at the close of the debate on July 13, 1866, he said this: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We may perhaps congratulate the House and the country on the new approach to 
the completion of a proposition to be submitted to the people for the admission 
of an outlawed community into the privileges and advantages of a civilized and free 
government. When I say that we should rejoice at such a completion, I do not 
  thereby intend so much to express joy at the superior excellence of the scheme 
  as that there is to be a scheme, a scheme containing much of positive good as 
  well, I am bound to admit, as the omission of many better things. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am going to skip some of it, but he concluded: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Do you inquire why, holding these views and possessing some will of my own, I 
accept so imperfect a proposition? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is talking about the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>I answer</b>: Because I live among men, and not among angels; among men as intelligent, 
as determined and as interested as myself, who, not agreeing with me, do not choose 
to yield their opinions to mine. Mutual concession, therefore, is our only resort, 
or mutual hostilities. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that one of the things which Stevens at that time found lacking 
was a provision to compel the elimination of school segregation, and that he thought 
then, as we urge now, that it is a matter of policy for the states, within their 
police power. </p>
<p>The debates and the absence of reference to school segregation in the House led 
to the conclusion that the House understood that the Fourteenth Amendment did not 
affect the right of the state to educate the Negro in segregated schools. Of the 
183 or so congressmen, 129 came from states which either had mandatory segregation 
or no education for the Negroes, and at least six others from states which had segregated 
school systems. </p>
<p>It is unlikely that they would have ignored the consequences of such measures 
on the school systems of their own states if they believed that they were abolishing 
school segregation. </p>
<p>The respondents state that the debates which followed the bill to enlarge the 
power of the Freedmen&#39;s Bureau amounted to a forthright assault on the idea that 
there could be racial segregation in the public schools, and then they rely upon 
Representative Hubbard of Connecticut, who made no mention of racial segregation 
in public schools; they rely on Representative Rousseau of Kentucky, who opposed 
the bill because he said the Bureau would take over all the schools used by white 
children; and they rely upon Representative Dawson, a white supremacist who, every
time the occasion arose, castigated the extreme radicals 
and suggested that the bill would permit white and Negro children to sit side by 
side. 
</p>
<p>In the debates on the Civil Rights bill, Representative Rogers of New Jersey 
and Kerr of Indiana stated that the bill would out-law segregation in the common 
schools of the various states. However, Representative Wilson of Iowa, Chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee and floor leader of the bill in the House, stated that 
it did not mean that Negro children would attend the same schools as white children, 
these not being civil rights or immunities. </p>
<p>In the amendment to the Freedmen&#39;s Bureau bill proposed by Representative Donnelly 
of Minnesota to require the Commissioner to provide common school education to all 
refugees and freedmen who shall apply therefore, was defeated—not a single reference 
or quotation by any proponent of the bill to support the statement that this was 
an assault on the idea that there could be racial segregation in the public schools.
</p>
<p>In the debates on the Civil Rights bill in the Senate, only Senator Cowan of 
Pennsylvania suggested that the bill would abolish segregation in the school systems 
in his State. No such suggestion appears to have been made in the Senate with respect 
to the Freedmen&#39;s Bureau or the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p>The silence in the Senate on the school question leads only to the conclusion 
that it was the understanding of the Senate that the measures would not affect segregated 
education. The senators and representatives were not oblivious to the effect of 
these measures on the school systems in their own states, nor would they have failed 
to discuss the consequences if they believed that segregation would be outlawed.
</p>
<p>The respondents state on page 91 of their brief that none of the bill&#39;s supporters 
in the House, except Wilson, deny that the bill had any effect of ending all caste 
legislation, including segregated schools, and that this was the view of the Senate. 
Well, the significant thing is not that no one contradicted the white supremacists, 
such as Rogers and Kerr and Cowan, but that no one contradicted Wilson, the man 
responsible for the bill, on the floor of the House, who specifically stated that 
the bill did not mean that Negro children would attend the same school as white 
children, holding that these were not civil rights or immunities. </p>
<p>Wilson&#39;s statement constituted an official interpretation, and neither Stevens 
nor Conkling nor Bingham nor Donnelly nor any other Radical Republican contradicted 
him; and the respondents have introduced nothing to explain the silence of the proponents 
of the bill with respect to segregation in schools. </p>
<p>The actions of a majority of the state legislatures which ratified the 
Fourteenth Amendment, in re-enacting school segregation laws or allowing such 
laws to stand, demonstrate the understanding of those legislatures, that the 
Fourteenth Amendment did not abolish such segregation; and we agree with the 
appellants&#39; statement on page 140 of their brief that if there was any 
authorization or requirement of segregation in state school laws, and after 
ratification the legislature took no action to end this disparity, undoubtedly 
it would appear that this state did not understand the Amendment to have the 
effect which appellants urge; and all the more reason, we state, that if the 
state legislature actually took action to continue or to compel school 
segregation, the legislature must have understood the Fourteenth Amendment not 
to abolish such segregation.</p>
<p>In some of the cases, the legislatures which ratified the Fourteenth Amendment 
provided for segregation; others permitted segregation; others had no segregation. 
In some instances, the segregation in schools was declared invalid under state laws, 
but not under the Fourteenth Amendment. In some cases, as in the case of New York, 
of ringing declarations that Negroes shall have full equality and the enjoyment 
of all civil and political rights, segregation was not regarded as a violation of 
such rights. Wherever segregation was abolished, whether by statute or by court 
decisions, there is no evidence that the Fourteenth Amendment entered into the question.
</p>
<p>As to the action by future Congresses under section 5, we state that the enforcement 
clause, section 5, was inserted in order to give Congress the power to supplement 
any civil remedies or other protection which might be available or through the courts 
by providing penalties for violation of the Amendment. The provisions of the Fourteenth 
Amendment do not permit Congress to broaden the Amendment, but merely provide for 
more effective remedies than those which might be obtained through the normal judicial 
process. </p>
<p>It cannot logically be argued that, although the Amendment was properly understood 
to be broad enough to eliminate segregation in public schools at the time it was 
enacted, that it was, nevertheless, understood that Congress might in the future 
make segregation illegal. </p>
<p>In answer to Question 3, we take the position that the problem obviously is a 
legislative one and not a judicial one. To construe the Amendment as requiring the 
abolition of segregation in the public schools would be to give the Amendment a 
meaning and an effect directly contrary to the understanding of the framers. It 
was clearly understood by both Congress which submitted, and the states which ratified, 
the Amendment that it was to have no effect on the public school system of the state. </p>
<p>The Court, if it should abolish segregation, would not be interpreting the document 
to meet new conditions, but would be meeting a problem which existed at the time 
of the Fourteenth Amendment—the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted—in a manner 
directly contrary to the intent of those who proposed and adopted the Amendment.
</p>
<p>The wisdom of abolishing segregation in public schools of the states was considered 
by Congress at and about the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. Congress 
consistently, whenever the matter arose, decided to leave this problem to the states.
</p>
<p>This Court is not in a position to judge to what extent the prejudices and tensions 
which gave rise to the segregation laws and the congressional decision to leave 
these matters to the states, have abated in any particular state or district, or 
to judge the wisdom of abolishing segregation in public schools of that state. The 
matter should be left where Congress originally left it, in the state legislatures.
</p>
<p>The problem before the Court is whether the people of those states, providing 
for a segregated school system, in the exercise of their judgment, based on 
firsthand knowledge of local conditions, decide that the state objective of free 
public education is best served by a system of separate but equal schools; and 
if I may borrow from—
</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: General, may I ask you what is the situation in Delaware 
today, as of this moment? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: In Delaware, in the high school district which is the Claymont School 
District—and I might say it is the northern part of the State, almost on the borderline 
of Pennsylvania—there are 19 school children in that school out of 22 eligible Negro 
children. The total enrollment, you might be interested in knowing, is five hundred 
in the high school, but about eight hundred in the entire school; it is a combination 
elementary and high school. </p>
<p>Now, in the other district, which is the elementary school district, and which 
is referred to as the Hockessin School District, there are six out of 46 that are 
attending that school, and that is also in New Castle County and on—near the Pennsylvania 
border, but more towards the west, the southwest; and I might add here that I heard 
the statement from—one of counsel, our adversaries, said that he was very happy 
to report that they were in those schools. Well, I do not know to what extent he 
is happy, but I might say, if I am permitted to say it outside the record, that 
in a recent survey there was an indication that there was not too much happiness 
in the district, in the school, particularly where the six out of the 46 are attending, 
and that situation is not solved in that particular district in New Castle County.
</p>
<p>MR, JUSTICE JACKSON: At any rate, Mr. Attorney General, we have no question in 
your case of shaping the remedy? I suppose the questions accidentally went to you 
as well as to the other counsel? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is right, yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: But in your case we have no problem of a decree? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: If segregation <i>per se</i> is declared invalid, that is the end of it.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: It goes to the state courts? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: So we have nothing to do with that? 
</p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is right.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: So that those questions should not really have been addressed 
to you, I think. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: It would have been very much appreciated if they had not been. </p>
<p>[Laughter.] </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: We have had the benefit of your observations. </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Thank you, Justice Frankfurter. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: In that county are there still existing segregated schools?
</p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: All except in two districts? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: Just the two districts 
are affected. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: And they are maintaining segregated schools? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: They are maintaining segregated— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: There are Negro residents and it is— </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is right. </p>
<p>If I may borrow from a statement made by the venerable Mr. John W. Davis, and 
quote from his brief this statement, he said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An emotional approach to this question is a poor substitute 
for a rational discussion of the problem at hand, which is to be judged by the application 
of well-settled principles governing the effect of the Fourteenth Amendment on the 
police power of the state. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arguments, I respectfully submit, such as I have heard in this courtroom 
for three days by our adversaries, have great emotional appeal; but they belong 
in an entirely different forum and in a different setting. Any change in state policy 
is for the legislature. The Fourteenth Amendment is a pact between the Federal Government 
and the individual states. </p>
<p>The intention of the parties was clear at the time it was adopted and ratified. 
In order to make that provision in the Constitution cover the question of public 
school segregation, it must be done within the framework of the Constitution, for 
as between providing for integrated or mixed schools in those states, where it is 
deemed best to maintain separate but equal schools, and preserving the meaning 
and intent of the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the sanctity of the 
pact between the Federal Government and the states, it is more important that this 
problem, however worthy, be dealt with within the meaning of our Constitution.
</p>
<p>As author Stanley Morrison, in conjunction with Charles Fairman, in a very scholarly 
article which appeared in the Stanford Law Review on &quot;The Judicial Interpretation 
of the Fourteenth Amendment&quot; aptly put it: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No matter how desirable the results might be, it is of the essence of our system 
that the judges must stay within the bounds of their constitutional power. Nothing 
is more fundamental, even the Bill of Rights. To depart from this fundamental is, 
in Mr. Justice Black&#39;s own words, `to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution.&#39;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal. </p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE 
WARREN: Mr. Redding? </p>
<p align="center"><b>ARGUMENT OF JACK GREENBERG, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: Mr. Greenberg. </p>
<p>If it please the Court, Mr. Redding and I shall argue only briefly in support 
of our position. </p>
<p>In this case, as the Attorney General of Delaware has indicated, plaintiffs prevailed 
in the courts below. The plaintiffs and members of their class are now in schools 
to which they sought admission, but the Attorney General is trying to get them out, 
and we appear here in an effort to keep them in the schools permanently. </p>
<p>As respondents here, we urge that the decision of the court below did not give 
respondents all that the Constitution guaranteed. Therefore, in this Court we urge 
that the decision below should be affirmed on grounds other than those given by 
the court below, and that segregation in elementary and high schools in the State 
of Delaware should be declared unconstitutional. </p>
<p>At the argument last term we submitted it was clear that the decision below could 
be affirmed on independent state grounds, and that this Court need not reach the 
constitutional question. But since this Court has seen fit to address to respondents 
in this case the same questions which it addressed to petitioners in numbers one, 
two, and four, we inferred that this Court believed that the constitutional question 
may be reached in this case. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I do not quite understand the general invitation to 
counsel to submit arguments on a certain point changes the relevant issue within 
the controversy; I do not quite understand that. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: I do not believe it changes the relevant issues, but we thought, 
perhaps, the Court was interested in the question of the constitutionality of segregation 
in the Delaware case. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: As with the Attorney General of Delaware, I am glad 
to get his observations; and I am glad to get yours; but I do not see that something 
which is not in issue before we asked specific questions in a group of cases becomes 
the issue because we had asked them. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: We submit that, although the decision below may be supported on 
an independent state ground, that in reality, equal protection of the laws will 
not be given to the respondents unless the constitutional 
question is reached, because, in truth and in fact, they are attending the 
schools in which they now are, so to speak, under a cloud. They are not like the 
rest of the students in the school; they are under— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I think you should have cross-appealed. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: You have not cross-appealed. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I understand you can sustain a decision below on any 
ground, but I do not understand that you can object to a decision below on a ground 
that you have not appealed from. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: Well, we did not cross-appeal, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, because 
we believed that we could urge other grounds for the affirmance of the judgment 
below. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: You can urge any ground you please that will justify 
the decree below; but you cannot go outside of the decree below. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: Well, it is our understanding— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I am glad to get your observations, but I might suggest 
I do not think the nature of the issues has been changed. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: I think the question was addressed in this case along with 
all the others, so if there were any variations they could be called to your attention. 
I do not think that we—speaking for myself—took into account the fact or expected 
in this case to deal with the problem of the decree and the relief or questions 
addressed to those things, because we cannot direct the state court as to what decree 
it shall enter. All we can say is, &quot;You shall not go beyond a certain point,&quot; which 
we say is the constitutional limit. Here affirmance is as far as we can go. We could 
not order them to shape their decree. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: It is our position, Mr. Justice Jackson, that the decree below 
does not give equal protection of the laws. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: You did not appeal. </p>
<p><b>MR. GREENBERG</b>: No, we did not. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: So far as this case is concerned, the most that we can do 
would be to affirm the decree; but you probably will have the benefit of anything 
said in any other case that is helpful. </p>
<p>[Whereupon, at two o&#39;clock p.m., a recess was held.] </p>
<p align="center"><b>AFTERNOON SESSION </b> </p>
<p align="center"><b>ARGUMENT OF THURGOOD MARSHALL, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS—RESUMED </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>During the luncheon recess, counsel in this case conferred, and it was agreed 
among—at least so far as we are concerned—that instead of going into the main part 
of the argument, that we would merely make a brief statement on it. And in the first 
point we wanted to make it clear the reason that we did not file cross-petitions 
in the court—and we have set out in our brief on the argument, the small one, on 
page two, three cases, Helvering v. Lerner, and Langnes v. Green; and we gathered 
from those cases that in the situation such as this, where we were not opposed to 
the decision of the lower court and merely wanted to urge other grounds for the 
decision in the case, that we should proceed with the case and merely urge in argument 
the point, specifically the point as to the validity of the segregated school statutes.
</p>
<p>We are afraid that, in that particular posture of the case, if the Court should 
rule that we should have cross-appealed, it could be interpreted that we have waived 
the other part of the case, and I merely wanted to briefly state our position on 
the main part, and that is that our primary responsibility here is to urge the Court 
not to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Delaware, and not to take the 
position urged by the Attorney General to reverse and send the matter back. In other 
words, so far as we are concerned, we are asking that the Court affirm the decision 
of the Supreme Court of Delaware. </p>
<p>The other point we wanted to urge upon the Court was, even if the Court is of 
the opinion that they should not pass upon the validity one way or the other of 
the Delaware statutes, because we did not cross-appeal or for some other reason, 
it appears to us that these cases are all consolidated, the state cases in particular, 
and that if the Court, in the Virginia and the South Carolina cases in particular, 
should make it clear that the state was without power to enforce such statutes in 
the State of Virginia and the State of South Carolina, then merely affirm the decision 
of the Delaware case, I have no doubt at all that the Supreme Court of Delaware 
would follow the rationale of the decisions in the Virginia and South Carolina cases; 
so that if, as has been urged over and over again—and as I understand the position of the Attorney General 
of Delaware—that when these physical facilities become equal they will then either 
put the colored children out or take some proceedings to have them removed, that 
if the Court goes the way I have just suggested, I have no doubt that at that time 
the same Supreme Court of Delaware, having considered the decision in the Virginia 
and South Carolina cases, would hold that the Attorney General could not have the 
children removed because as of that time it would clearly be the decision of this 
Court that in such instances the State of Delaware as well as the State of Virginia 
and South Carolina are without power to enforce such statutes. </p>
<p>So it seems to me to narrow down to the position that in this case, if the 
Court merely affirms the decision of the Supreme Court of Delaware, the first 
task that we have before this Court is to urge this Court to affirm that 
decision; at least go that far, because to us the decision in the Supreme Court 
of Delaware is the minimum that we could expect on our theory of what the 
Fourteenth Amendment requires. And with that, I don&#39;t need the McLaurin or any of the other cases to urge that 
upon the Court. </p>
<p>I go all the way back to the Gaines case, where Chief Justice Hughes said that 
the laws segregating the races depend for their validity upon the equality that 
is offered under it. So I think in that case, and despite all Mr. Young said earlier 
about what was peculiar to Delaware and what have you, I do not find anything that 
says that this Court should reverse the decision which said merely that in the absence 
of equal physical facilities the colored children have to be admitted to the existing 
facilities. So on that very narrow basis, it seems to me that the judgment of the 
Delaware court should be affirmed, at least on that narrow basis. </p>
<p>Our other ground that we urged, which was that in the decision and opinion of 
this Court, the expression be—or rather not, instruction—but that it should be made 
clear to the Delaware court that they are not required, as they thought, by the 
prior decisions of this Court to uphold the validity of the statutes, so that at 
future times it can be applied to the same plaintiffs in this case. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I do not think that we should reply in detail to the Attorney General 
of Delaware&#39;s argument about the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, because our 
argument in the other cases has been full; and I do not know anything to add to 
our other argument; and I do not see anything that has been added by Mr. Young&#39;s 
argument which would require us to meet it, except the peculiar situation in Delaware.
</p>
<p>He thinks it is peculiar; we think it is peculiar. We have both dealt with it 
in great detail in our briefs, and I think that is as far as I would like to go 
on that. </p>
<p>I agree that the remedy point is most certainly not involved in this case. I 
think, as in the South Carolina and Virginia cases, the only points involved are 
the points as to the congressional intent and the reliance that I understand from 
Mr. Young&#39;s argument runs the same as the others. We have the segregation in the 
schools of the District of Columbia, that they did not intend to exclude—rather, 
they did intend to exclude—school segregation. </p>
<p>All of the lawyers have repeatedly argued that, since the states had segregation 
statutes when they ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, we would gather something 
from that, when in truth and in fact, this Court in the case of Neal v. Delaware 
and specifically—of course, they were speaking of the jury situation—in that case 
the Court said specifically, this Court: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Fourteenth Amendment was intended to strike the word `white&#39; out of all those 
statutes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems to me when you pick up one point or another point it will do the 
Court no good. </p>
<p>The other point urged by the Attorney General is on the power argument and what 
this Court can do in the situation; and as I understand the power argument, it is, 
so far as we are concerned, that the authority of this Court is clear, and no one 
disputes that. </p>
<p>The real question involved is as to whether or not the states involved as of 
now, today, do or do not have power to use race and race alone for the basis of 
segregation, and that applies, our theory, that the states have been effectively 
deprived of that power hold as true—Mr. Young emphasized this—in Delaware, which 
is just beside Pennsylvania. It applies as well there as it applies in South Carolina 
and Virginia; and therefore, unless there are questions, we submit this case and 
urge the Court to affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Delaware. </p>
<p>Thank you, sirs. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Might I ask General Young whether the specific judgment 
we have before us is the final order that was entered by the Chancellor, which was 
adopted by the court? Is that your understanding? </p>
<p><b>MR. YOUNG</b>: That is right. There is nothing in rebuttal. </p>
<p>[Whereupon, at 2:40 o&#39;clock p.m., oral argument in the above-entitled matter 
was concluded.] </p>
