Five cases are broadly considered part of the **Brown v. Board of Education (I)**
decision.  The initial arguments in those five cases occurred on December 9-11, 1952, followed by rearguments
on December 7-9, 1953.  The decision, also known as "Brown I", was issued on May 17,1954.  The arguments in
those five cases are listed below.

A second round of arguments, focusing on the question of relief, occurred on April 11-14, 1955, and a second
"Brown II" decision was issued on May 31, 1955.  See [Brown v. Board of Education (II)](/transcripts/pre-1955/brown2/)
for a list of those arguments.
