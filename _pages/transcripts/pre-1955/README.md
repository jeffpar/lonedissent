This collection extends our selection of [Pre-1968 Transcripts](/transcripts/pre-1968/) with even older
transcripts from the U.S. Supreme Court Library and other sources, such as the "Landmark Briefs and Arguments"
series.

The focus here is on cases that don't have an audio recording (i.e, pre-1955 cases), since
[The Oyez Project](https://www.oyez.org) already does a fine job providing unofficial transcripts
of all tape-recorded cases argued since October 1955.  See [Transcripts](/transcripts/) for further discussion.

## October Term 1947

The [Parker v. Illinois [PDF]](/transcripts/pre-1955/#1947-062) case is interesting because it featured a
*pro se* litigant who was also not a lawyer.  It's also unclear to what extent the Court was aware
of this fact, because there's this curious exchange near the end of the argument:

> **JUSTICE RUTLEDGE**: Mr. Parker, I would like to ask one question and I would like to state
it very carefully and have you answer it just as I put it.

> **MR. PARKER**: Yes, sir.

> **JUSTICE RUTLEDGE**: Does the record show -- I don't want yes or no to anything else -- does this
record show whether you are a member of the Bar or not?

> **MR. PARKER**: I am not. The record shows I am not.

> **JUSTICE RUTLEDGE**: All right.

> **MR. PARKER**: The record shows I am not. Oh, no, I am not a lawyer.

Mr. Parker didn't prevail (although he did garner 3 dissenting votes).  And *pro se* non-lawyers do sometimes
win, as Mr. Sloan did in [SEC v. Sloan (1978)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1977/76-1607).  But Mr. Sloan was the
last non-lawyer to argue at the Supreme Court, and ever since the Court [changed its rules in 2013](https://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2013RulesoftheCourt.pdf#page=40), non-lawyers have not been permitted to argue
their own cases at the Supreme Court.
