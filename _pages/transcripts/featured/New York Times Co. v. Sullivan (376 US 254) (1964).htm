<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: No. 39, <i>New York Times Company,</i> petitioner, versus <i>L. B. Sullivan.</i></p>
<p>BAILIFF: Counsel are present.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Mr. Wechsler?</p>
<center>OPENING ARGUMENT OF HERBERT WECHSLER, ESQ.,<br>
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER</center>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</p>
<p class="P1">This case is here together with No. 40 on writ of
certiorari granted a year ago to the Supreme Court of Alabama. It
summons for review a judgment of that court which poses, in our
submission, hazards to the freedom of the press with a dimension not
confronted since the early days of the Republic.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: I am sorry; I am having difficulty hearing you.</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I was saying that the writ calls for review of a
judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama which, in our submission,
poses hazards for the freedom of the press not confronted since the
early days of the Republic. The questions presented are, in general:
first, how far the civil law of libel may be used by state officials to
punish the publication of statements critical of their official conduct
or of the conduct of the agencies of which they are in charge; and
second, how far a state may force a newspaper which publishes a
thousand miles away to defend libel actions instituted in its forum
because its correspondents go there on occasion to cover news of
national importance, a very small amount of advertising emanates from
sources within the state, and a very small circulation of the paper—in
this instance, 394 copies of a total daily circulation of 650,000—found
its way into the state.</p>
<p class="P1">The problems arise in this context: The action was instituted by the respondent, Mr. L. B. Sullivan, one of the three elected <b>[*2]</b>
Commissioners of the City of Montgomery, Alabama. It was brought
against The Times and four co–defendants who were then residents of
Alabama—four clergymen, the Reverends Abernathy, Shuttlesworth, Seay
and Lowery. These are the petitioners in No. 40. The complaint demands
damages of half a million dollars for libel allegedly contained in two
paragraphs of a full page advertisement that was published in The Times
on March 29, 1960.</p>
<p class="P1">I should say that similar actions based on the same
advertisement were instituted by the other two City Commissioners, by a
former Commissioner, and by the then–Governor of the State of Alabama,
Governor Patterson. The <i>ad damnums</i> in these other suits total
two million dollars. But this was the first of the five cases brought
to trial and it resulted in a verdict and judgment against all
defendants for the half million dollars claimed.</p>
<p class="P1">Of the other cases, only the <i>James</i> case, the case
by Mayor James, has gone to trial. There was the same verdict there,
but that is pending on motion for new trial in the Alabama court. The
other three cases were removed by The Times to the United States
district court. The removal was sustained by the district court. But
remand was ordered in a divided judgment of the Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit, and that case, involving the order of remand, is
also pending in this Court on petition for writ of certiorari in No. 52
of this term.</p>
<p class="P1">The publication claimed to libel the respondents—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: The <i>James</i> case, was that not another Commissioner of Montgomery?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: He was the Commissioner, called the Mayor.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: One of the three Commissioners is the Mayor?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes, sir; one of the three Commissioners.</p>
<p class="P1">That case, of course, was not removed. That was after verdict.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: And what’s the status of that case now?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It’s pending in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County
on an as yet undetermined motion for new trial, presumably being held
pending the decision of this Court here.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Was it averred in that case also for 500,000 dollars?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It was, Mr. Justice.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Was that the amount requested as damages?</p>
<b>[*3]</b>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It was.</p>
<p class="P1">The publication which the respondent claims to have
libeled him was attached to the complaint and it’s most readily
available, in facsimile form, at the back of our brief. Since, in my
submission, the case not only begins with the publication, but ends
there as well, I respectfully invite the Court’s attention to the text.
As it shows upon its face, it was an advertisement published on behalf
of an organization—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS: Where is that printed?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It’s in the appendix to the brief, Mr. Justice
Douglas—which, of course, is a facsimile copy. This reproduces the way
it looked in The Times when it was published, as well as the text.</p>
<p class="P1">It was published on behalf of a committee, the name of
which is on the bottom, which is called “The Committee to Defend Martin
Luther King in the Struggle for Freedom in the South.”</p>
<p class="P1">The Chairman of the Committee was A. Philip Randolph. The
Co–Chairman was Gardner C. Taylor—Dr. Taylor of New York. The other
officers of the Committee are listed at the bottom of the page. They
include such names as Father Ford and Dr. Fosdick. The members appear
under the statement, “Your Help Is Urgently Needed Now,” some sixty
names of well known people—actors, lawyers, clergymen, politicians like
Norman Thomas, and the name of Mrs. Roosevelt.</p>
<p class="P1">The object of the publication was to obtain financial
support for the three needs—and I am now quoting—which were stated in
the last paragraph, the paragraph beginning, “We urge you to join
hands.” And those needs are put as the defense of Martin Luther King,
who, I should add, was then facing trial for perjury in Montgomery,
Alabama. The funds were for the defense of Martin Luther King, the
support of the embattled students, and the struggle for the right to
vote. These are the stated goals of the solicitation.</p>
<p class="P1">The recitation in the text, these ten paragraphs of small type, is, of course, a statement designed to support this cause.</p>
<p class="P1">The lead caption, “Heed Their Rising Voices,” is a phrase
that was taken from a New York Times editorial of some days earlier, as
is indicated in the top right–hand corner, where there’s a quotation
from the editorial which indicates accurately the sympathy with which
this newspaper has viewed the Negro mass demonstrations in the South.</p>
<p class="P1">The text itself begins with the assertion that:</p>
<blockquote>Thousands of southern Negro students are <b>[*4]</b>
engaged in widespread nonviolent demonstrations in positive affirmation
of the right to live in human dignity as guaranteed by the U.S.
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</blockquote>
<p class="P1">And it proceeds to claim that:</p>
<blockquote>In their efforts to uphold these guarantees they are being
met by an unprecedented wave of terror by those who would deny and
negate that document which the whole world looks upon as setting the
pattern for modern freedom.</blockquote>
<p class="P1">Now, the succeeding paragraphs recite a series of alleged
abuses visited on student demonstrators in some dozen southern cities,
including Montgomery, Alabama. Then the paragraphs go on to praise Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr., as a symbol and the inspiration of the
movement, to allege that his peaceful protests have been answered by
what the ad calls “the southern violators” with intimidation and
violence designed to remove him as a leader. They urge the importance
of defending Dr. King, and the need of material help by those who, in
the language of the advertisement, “are taking the risk, facing jail
and even death in glorious reaffirmation of our Constitution and its
Bill of Rights.”</p>
<p class="P1">I suggest, therefore, that the text was thus a statement
of protest, an encomium, interwoven, to be sure, with a recitation of
events. But it names no names but Dr. King’s, and plainly makes no
personal attack on any individual. And reading it in this way, noting
the prominence of the names of some of the signatories, the employees
of The Times who received the copy and the order for its publication
from a New York advertising agency, received it, of course, in New
York, approved its publication as what is called in newspaper parlance
an editorial–type advertisement. And so the publication appeared.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, the respondent claimed in the complaint, and the
court and jury found, that he was libeled by the third paragraph of the
advertisement, the paragraph that begins, “In Montgomery, Alabama,” and
by the first eight lines of the sixth paragraph, at the bottom of the
middle column, the words that begin, “Again and again the southern
violators.” These were the portions of the advertisement set forth in
the complaint on which the action was based.</p>
<p class="P1">Turning from the complaint to the record, the
respondent’s evidence showed that this third paragraph beginning “In
Montgomery, Alabama” was indeed inaccurate in some particulars, and I
would like to state as faithfully as I can what those inaccuracies <b>[*5]</b>
were. It was shown by the evidence, which I might say consisted of a
very imposing record which proves to be very much less difficult than
it seems, because a great part of it consists of nothing but the
reproduction of newspaper stories that were published by The New York
Times and which the respondents claim showed it was doing business in
Alabama—but at least half of these five volumes consist of nothing but
these stories. The evidence in the libel action is all in the second
volume, and it doesn’t run to more than a couple of hundred pages,
actually. It might be helpful if I said that it runs from page 567 to
818. The whole case on the merits is in those pages.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, I say respondent’s evidence, which consisted
principally of reports that were made to The New York Times by its
investigators after this controversy started and the suit was
threatened or instituted—The Times had Claude Sitton, its Atlanta
correspondent, and a lad named McKee, who was a stringer in Montgomery,
investigate what had happened, and these reports came in. They were
then obtained on discovery by the plaintiffs and put into the record,
and they really constitute the—I shouldn’t say the whole, because the
respondent cavils with this, but I’ll say the heart of the case as to
what actually occurred.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, what it shows is that there was a big demonstration
in Montgomery. A thousand students went down from the Alabama State
College, the Negro college there, went down to the capitol steps as a
group, and, massing on the steps, they said the Lord’s Prayer and sang
the Star–Spangled Banner, and then they walked back to the campus. This
was a protest against the earlier denial of lunch counter service in
the courthouse building to some thirty students who had demanded
service.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Alabama State College is entirely Negro?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: So I understand, Mr. Justice.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: And it’s in or near Montgomery, Alabama?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It is.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, after this had happened, nine of the student leaders
of this lunch counter demonstration were in fact expelled from college.
They were expelled by the State Board of Education, of which the
Governor was <i>ex officio</i> chairman, and of which he appointed the
members, I believe. The minutes of that meeting showing their expulsion
also appear in the record. They were proved independently by another
witness by respondent. And, of course, when the expulsion took place
there was a student strike in protest. That, <b>[*6]</b> I think, is consistent with what the paragraph says.</p>
<p class="P1">But the statement was inaccurate in saying, as it did,
that the students refused to re–register. They didn’t refuse to
re–register, or at least only an infinitesimal number may have. And,
more than that, the ad was wrong in stating that their dining hall was
padlocked in an attempt to starve them into submission. There is no
evidence that the dining hall was padlocked. The evidence is that it
was not padlocked, and perforce there was no attempt to starve the
students into submission.</p>
<p class="P1">And, reverting to the first sentence, which says that
“Truck–loads of police armed with shotguns and tear gas ringed the
campus,” the evidence doesn’t show that the police ever ringed the
campus in any literal sense. It shows that they were deployed near the
campus in large numbers on three occasions. Their armament is not shown
by the record one way or another. And then it is true that after a
subsequent—within a period of a few days, there was another student
demonstration, this time on the campus, and the superintendent of
grounds called the police and they came in, the students had grown
rowdy, and they made some 32 arrests. The arrested students
subsequently, the record shows, pleaded guilty and were fined in
varying amounts for minor crimes like disorderly conduct.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, if I turn to the sixth paragraph, the southern
violators paragraph, I have to say that it was shown by the evidence to
be a lot more accurate. Dr. King’s home had at that time been bombed,
not once but twice. One of the bombs failed to go off; the other did go
off. He and his wife were home at the time. He claimed, at least, to
have been assaulted on one occasion when he was arrested, though the
arresting officer denied that there had been a physical assault, and
there is a controversy in the record about that. And he was arrested
not seven times, to be sure, as the paragraph says, but it was
established that he was arrested four times. And, as I said earlier, he
at this very time was charged with perjury in an indictment on two
counts which did indeed carry a potential sentence of ten years if he
had been convicted. He was in fact subsequently acquitted of that
charge.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, these are the essential facts about the publication
that the courts below held unprotected by the First Amendment. I come
now to the theory—I shall not permit myself to call it evidence—that
was relied on to sustain a verdict that these statements to which I
have called attention libeled this respondent.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Before you do that, may I ask you this: Dr. King’s four arrests, were they in Montgomery?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: There were four in Montgomery. There actu–<b>[*7]</b>ally
was another one outside of Montgomery, Mr. Justice. But when I said
four I meant four in Montgomery. I’m glad you asked me that because it
reminds me that I failed to call attention to the perfectly obvious
fact that this sixth paragraph doesn’t say a thing about Montgomery.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: That is what the purport of my question was. I
wasn’t clear from the recitation in the briefs. This refers to southern
violators. The rest could be anywhere in the South?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Exactly.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: You say he was arrested a total of five times in the South?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: He was arrested four times in Montgomery, and my
recollection is that that didn’t count another arrest at Atlanta. I
think perhaps it was on a perjury charge. He had been in Atlanta and
was arrested there. I am reasonably confident of my recollection about
the fifth. It would be easy to check.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Was there anything specifically in the fifth paragraph that they object to?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: No, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: The sixth?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It is the sixth, yes. The words beginning “Again and
again,” and down through the italicized words “ten years” on the eighth
line.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Mr. Wechsler, is the college within the city limits?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I believe it is. I believe it is.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: All within the city limits. But it is a state college?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It is a state college.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: And it is state property?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I assume so.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: And it is state–supported?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I know that it is a state college under the State Board of Education, with the Governor of the State the <i>ex officio</i> chairman of the board of trustees.</p>
<b>[*8]</b>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: May I ask, Mr. Wechsler, turning again to that
sixth paragraph, is it every statement of every sentence to which the
libel charge is addressed? In other words, “Again and again the
Southern violators have answered Dr. King’s peaceful protests with
intimidation and violence.” Is that it?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I would have to answer your question in this way, Mr.
Justice: I would have to refer to what the respondent argued at various
times of this case. The pleading did not separate out any particular
statement, and under the Alabama practice no innuendo need be alleged.
So that we are at a loss—and it gives, I may say, a very unreal quality
to this proceeding—we are at a loss to know precisely in what respect
the respondent claims that he was libeled.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: But as I understood you so far, in effect you
have conceded there was either a misstatement or inaccuracy in the word
“seven.”</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: But do you otherwise?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: No, I don’t concede any inaccuracy. But I say that the
record shows a contrarity of evidence on the question of whether Dr.
King was assaulted.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: Yes. The only concession you’re making as to inaccuracy is as to the word “seven.”</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Exactly, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: I suppose the ad really charges eight, doesn’t
it? Seven arrests of a certain type. Now they have charged him with
perjury. Does that make the eighth?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Well, that’s a problem of construction. That point was
not made by our opponents. They made almost every other point, but they
didn’t make that one.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: I suppose that is technically inaccurate when
it says perjury on one count, punishable by ten years. It takes two
counts, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes. But I think, in order to understand Commissioner
Sullivan’s position fully—and I would like to put it now as I
understand it—but let me say first that he has been a commissioner,
elected commissioner, of the City of Montgomery, since October 5, 1959,
and he is specifically the Commissioner of Public Affairs, and as such
his jurisdiction includes the supervision of a number of
departments—police, fire, scales, and cemeteries being <b>[*9]</b> the
four, as I understand the record indicates. He doesn’t supervise the
police force daily in the sense that the police chief does, and there
is a police chief. But the police chief reports to Sullivan and is
responsible to Sullivan. So it’s simply like the relationship, in large
cities, between the police commissioner and the mayor. The commissioner
is in charge of day–to–day operations. The mayor is his boss, in charge
of the whole show.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, Commissioner Sullivan testified, and what he said
was, quite simply, that he felt that the statements in the
advertisement that referred to events in Montgomery reflected on him,
on the other commissioners, and on the whole community. And he added
that when they described police action or police activities, they were
associated particularly with himself as the Commissioner who had
jurisdiction over the police department. And this really is the basic
claim of the respondent and the case on which he won, that references
to the police brought this publication home to him because he was the
Commissioner who had jurisdiction over the police. And the witnesses
who testified for him, people in Montgomery, some of them friends of
his, testified to just about that.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: Did the police chief himself bring an action?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: No, he did not, Mr. Justice. He apparently took a
different view of the appropriate response to this type of publication.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Has the statute of limitations run out?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I think it has, sir.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, I think the most helpful thing that I could do next
is to emphasize what the references to the police and the police
activities are, and I call to the Court’s attention that there are only
two allusions to police in the parts of the ad that are involved. There
is the statement in the first paragraph that, “After their leaders were
expelled from school, truckloads of police ringed the campus, armed
with shotguns and tear gas.” The rest of that paragraph refers to state
authorities; when the entire student body protested to state
authorities, their dining hall was padlocked.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Does the word “police” necessarily refer to local police? Could it be state police?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It could be the state police. It could be.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: What were the facts two days later? You mentioned there were more police and a number of arrests.</p>
<b>[*10]</b>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: No, these were the Montgomery police who made these arrests.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: On this occasion, those who were there on this occasion were Montgomery police?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: You said they were stationed nearby or something like that?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: These Montgomery police, the record shows, were deployed nearby. That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, as far as the sixth paragraph is concerned—I do want
to say this: So far as the padlocking statement is concerned, I submit
that from the context—and this is the real grievance about this
paragraph, incidentally, the padlocking—I submit that that grievance
has just absolutely nothing to do with the respondent. If anybody has a
grievance about it, it’s the state authorities that are referred to in
those words, and not the Commissioner of the City of Montgomery, or any
local authority, even if this theory of reference to the individual
could be accepted, which I deny.</p>
<p class="P1">And the sixth paragraph, of course, makes no allusions to
Montgomery at all, as I indicated earlier in response to Mr. Justice
Goldberg’s question, and the only reference to the police is on the
seven arrests, which was wrong; it should have been four.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, we urged below, and we argue here, that such a
reference as that to the police cannot be read as an allusion to the
respondent, as Commissioner in charge, in the context of a prosecution
of an action for libel. But even if it could, what I have said I think
makes clear that any evidential basis for the claim of falsity must
rest on very small discrepancies indeed between what was said and what
the record shows to have been the case.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, at this point I think I should recognize that the
respondent takes a wholly different view of what this case is about,
and I wish to state his view. He says that the claim of libel was that
this publication charged Commissioner Sullivan with padlocking the
dining hall, with bombing Dr. King’s home, with assaulting and
arresting him, with charging him with perjury, and indeed, with
everything that happened except that, for some reason that I don’t
quite understand, he makes an exception to the expulsion of students.
He acknowledges that that was the jurisdiction of the State Board of
Education, and he doesn’t take that to allude to himself.</p>
<p class="P1">When it came to the testimony about this reading of this
document, which I submit is fantastic, the respondent merely said that
he considered that, since these statements appeared in paragraphs that
contained a reference to the police, that they all refer <b>[*11]</b>
to the same people, or at least could reasonably be taken to refer to
the same people, and that he did take them all to refer to himself. And
accepting this theory, the trial court permitted him solemnly to prove
that he hadn’t really bombed Dr. King’s home, and that the police in
fact had done everything they could to solve that atrocious crime, had
worked overtime on it and so on, which of course was not challenged by
anybody; and counsel for the defense, caught in this position, found
himself saying, well, we don’t claim that this was true, and of course
they didn’t claim that it was true, that Commissioner Sullivan bombed
Dr. King’s home. On the contrary, what we claimed, and claimed
throughout the trial, was that this piece of paper couldn’t be read to
make the charge that Commissioner Sullivan had bombed Dr. King’s home.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, I don’t think any of the other facts in the record
add significantly to the case. The Times did retract these two
paragraphs formally at the request of the Governor of Alabama, the
then–Governor, Governor Patterson, who claimed to have been libeled,
and The Times published a retraction saying that they didn’t intend to
imply by this statement any misconduct on the part of the Governor. In
explaining why they did this, they said they did it in deference to the
high office that he held as Governor of the State.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: What is the effect of retraction under Alabama law?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: The effect of it, Mr. Justice, was to bar punitive
damages, if considered adequate under the Alabama retraction statute.
Governor Patterson obviously didn’t think it adequate because he sued
for a million dollars after he got it. But that would be an issue in
that case if it ever went to trial, as to whether he would be entitled
to any punitive damages.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, The Times didn’t apologize to the respondent, and
indeed, when he wrote a demand for a retraction, The Times’ counsel
replied that, as far as they could tell, the third paragraph of the ad
was accurate except for the padlocking statement, and they couldn’t see
how that or anything else referred to Commissioner Sullivan. And they
asked him to let them know, if he would, how he did feel that it
referred to him. And, of course, he brought suit at that point instead
of undertaking correspondence. And that didn’t surprise The Times,
which knew that he wanted to bring suit.</p>
<p class="P1">The only other thing is that at the trial itself, Harding
Bancroft, who was then Secretary of The New York Times, repeated what
in substance had been said in the interrogatories earlier, that while
it was very hard to say what The New York Times thought <b>[*12]</b>
about the truth of these statements, since The Times is a large
enterprise composed of many individuals, that he could say that all of
the knowledge that The Times had was embodied in these reports to which
I have referred, and that as he read them he considered that, except
for the padlocking statement, the material was generally—the general
tenor of the material was substantially correct. And of course the
Supreme Court of Alabama made a great deal of this testimony of Mr.
Bancroft on the appeal, and viewed it, I should say, as the prime basis
for sustaining the punitive award.</p>
<p class="P1">Now I come to the rulings.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: Could I ask you a question?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes, indeed, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: How many days was this advertisement published?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: One day.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: Just one day?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes, just March 29th.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: 394 copies, you say?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: 394 copies went to Alabama, of which some 350 went to
mail subscribers in Alabama, being put in the United States mails in
New York, and the balance went by carrier, by mail carrier, perhaps a
few even air mail, or air carrier, I mean, to news stands, news
dealers, in Alabama, who simply sold them. So that I suppose you get
The New York Times at a few news stands in Alabama the way you would
get The Montgomery Advertiser in Time Square in New York City if you
look for it.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, the courts below denied our contention that this
publication was protected by the First Amendment. All they said about
it was that the First Amendment did not protect libelous statements.
Then, on the libel part of the case they ruled that these paragraphs in
suit were libelous <i>per se,</i> testing that by the general test,
whether they tended to injure reputation. And that was the ruling made
by the court. No jury ever passed on whether these statements were
libelous.</p>
<p class="P1">But the trail court did submit to the jury the question of whether these statements, which the jury was told were libelous <i>per se,</i> were made of and concerning Commissioner Sullivan. That question was put to the jury.</p>
<p class="P1">As to the rest, the court told the jury that, when a statement is libelous <i>per se,</i> falsity and malice, and special damage—falsity <b>[*13]</b>
and malice and general damages are presumed, that there was no need for
any proof of damage by the plaintiff, actual damage by the plaintiff
whatsoever, and that punitive damages were available.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Before you develop that, let me see if I
understand the court’s ruling. Would there be encompassed in the
court’s ruling that since this, in the language of Mr. Sullivan’s
testimony, reflected upon the community as well as himself, and since
the ad refers to southern violators, did the court mean that any member
of the community was libeled by this?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Well, I can’t say that the court went that far, Mr.
Justice. I think that emphasis was placed on the official position of
Commissioner Sullivan. The Alabama Supreme Court made its view quite
explicit. It encountered the question on the issue whether, either as a
matter of state law or as a matter of constitutional law, there was
here sufficient evidence connecting this publication with the
respondent, so that even on conventional grounds there was any basis
for a verdict. And what the court said is at page 1157 of the record,
and the substance of it was that, in measuring the performance or
deficiencies of groups, public groups like police, fire department,
other municipal agents, praise or criticism is usually attached to the
official in complete control of the body, that this is common
knowledge, and, as they said, has its origin in established legal
patterns. I don’t know what those legal patterns were. But in any
event, this comes very close, but does not actually become, a kind of
presumption, that if you talk about the police you’re talking about the
commissioner. I can’t say that the New York police tap wires, for
example, though I believe they do, without giving Commissioner Murphy
an axe against me, since it’s illegal for them to do it without a court
order in New York under the federal law. And I have got to prove truth
and make my defense by proving truth, if this doctrine is
constitutional libel law. And, of course, we submit that it is not.</p>
<p class="P1">And our contention that the verdict and the judgment,
including, of course, the separate attack on the enormous award, worked
an abridgment of the freedom of the press, were all rejected.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: The award is a single award?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It is, Mr. Justice, yes.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: To include, I gather, both general and punitive damages?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes.</p>
<b>[*14]</b>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: It is the practice, I gather, to separate the two?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: We prayed for a separation, which was denied. We
argued that this was error in the Supreme Court of Alabama. It’s not
adverted to in the opinion, and I assume therefore that there is no
requirement of state law that there be such a separation.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: In any event, I gather, there was no proof of
actual damages, other than as flows from the supposed presumption?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Exactly. I would say the presumption, if there is a
real presumption, was rebutted on the record, because the respondent’s
own witnesses said they didn’t believe it of him, and they didn’t think
any the less of him. And he was asked if he could show he was hurt in
any way. In no way had he been hurt, and the record is absolutely clear
on that.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: Does the record show how long the jury was out?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I have it in my mind, Mr. Justice, that the jury was
out two hours, and I believe the record shows it. But I can’t be sure
the record shows it. I’m pretty sure it was two hours and a few minutes.</p>
<p class="P1">My opponent says a little over two hours.</p>
<p class="P1">Now I come to my legal submissions. We have, on the libel
part of the case, essentially two, perhaps three, really. Our first
proposition is that this action was judged in Alabama by an
unconstitutional rule of law, a rule of law offensive to the First
Amendment, and offensive on its face to the First Amendment. Taking
that rule, what it amounts to is that a public official is entitled to
recover presumed and punitive damages, subject to no legal limit in
amount, for the publication of a statement critical of his official
action or even of the official action of an agency under his general
supervision, if the court finds that the statement tends to injure
reputation—which the court did find here—and the jury finds that the
statement makes a reference to him. And the only defense available is
that the statement is true in all its factual and material particulars.
There is no qualified privilege in Alabama, as there is in some states,
as the court pointed out in <i>Barr</i> v. <i>Matteo.</i> The
qualified privilege rule that goes beyond allowing truth as a defense
doesn’t apply in Alabama, and indeed, the writers say it’s a minority
rule. So in that sense, I’ll grasp that nettle and say that, as applied
to this kind of a statement, we are attacking the <b>[*15]</b> constitutionality of the majority rule as it appears in the black letter of libel law.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: The basic assumption behind that contention,
if I understand you correctly, is that a state fashioning of a common
law rule may violate the Constitution. Does that underlie this facet of
your argument?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Certainly. Certainly we assume that, but I shouldn’t
suppose that is controversial. That was certainly true in the <i>Bridges</i> case, as to contempt. And it was true in the <i>Cantwell</i> case as to breach of the peace.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Proceeding from that, which is an established
doctrine, the second proves that the state may obviously fashion libel
and slander rules under the common law without offending the First
Amendment. But it is the particular rule which is fashioned under these
circumstances that you assail?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It’s this rule, as applied to officials and the
criticism of official conduct which we submit is what the First
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States—I would not say was
exclusively about, but was primarily about. And we are actually making
here, in relation to this rule of law, the same argument that James
Madison made and that Thomas Jefferson made with respect to the
validity of the Sedition Act of 1798.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: How far does this go, Mr. Wechsler? As long as the criticism is addressed to official conduct?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: To official conduct? Are there any limits
whatever which take it outside the protection of the First Amendment?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Well, if I take my instruction from James Madison, I
would have to say that within any references that Madison made I can
see no toying with limits or with exclusions.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: You say, then, the First Amendment gives it, in effect, an absolute privilege to criticize—</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: The proposition is that the First Amendment was
precisely designed to do away with seditious libel, and seditious libel
was the punishment of criticism of the Government and criticism of
officials.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: And this applies not only to newspapers but to anybody?</p>
<b>[*16]</b>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Exactly; of course.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: In other words, you are not arguing here for a special rule that applies to newspapers?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Certainly not. We are talking about the full ambit of
the First Amendment. Now, I realize the weight of this argument at this
time. The Sedition Act was never passed on. But on the other hand, as I
see our case, we’re in the same position that the contempt cases were
in in 1940, when the scope of the contempt power had never been
considered by this Court. When obscenity was here, that issue had never
been considered. In short, this is a field of constitutional
interpretation which is 35 years old. That is a fact of life. And this
is the first time that we have had the opportunity—that the opportunity
has arisen to make this submission in this Court. But I believe that if
James Madison were alive today, so far as anything that I can see in
anything that he wrote, particularly in the report on the Virginia
Resolutions, that the submission that I am making is the submission he
would make.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Your argument would be the same and would cover
this situation if The New York Times or anybody else had accused this
official of taking a bribe?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Certainly.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Or buying his office?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Certainly. Of course, in the historic period in which
Madison was writing, charges of bribery were common, and it was this
type of press freedom that he saw in the First Amendment.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Mr. Wechsler, we don’t have here a case of a deliberate falsehood.</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: No.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: So we don’t really need to—I don’t suppose that’s really posed here.</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Oh, I think it’s posed because the constitutionality
of the rule by which the case was judged, when challenged, as this was
challenged, is surely in issue. But there are different points that can
be made. And this brings me to my second—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: The next are narrower?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: The next are narrower, and there are two.</p>
<p class="P1">First, I would like to emphasize what it comes to. The issue <b>[*17]</b>
is, I think, whether a state may constitutionally, for the sake of
protecting individual—I am sorry, for the sake of protecting official
reputations—we’re not dealing with individual reputations here, we’re
dealing with official reputations. It’s criticism of his official
conduct that’s involved, not private conduct, not his private life,
though I admit that that’s not an easy line to draw, since obviously
private affairs do bear on official competence, and I’m not trying to
oversimplify this.</p>
<p class="P1">But if this is a valid rule of law, the proposition must
be that it is constitutional to prefer the protection of official
reputation against that diminution which arises from the criticism of
your official conduct, that it’s constitutional to prefer that to the
freedom of criticism, or at least to do so where the criticism can be
proved to be false. Now, that pitches everything—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Now, do we assume that it is false, if the jury has found that it is?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I don’t think you can assume it was false here—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: You mean, assume that it was not deliberate, as I understood you had something to say about that.</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes. But the record shows how far it was true and how far it was false, Mr. Justice.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: And the jury passed on it?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: The jury passed on it.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: And they held that it was false?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Well, the jury actually didn’t have the issue of
falsity submitted to it. The jury was told that it was presumably
false. And it is true that we couldn’t plead truth, and the reason why
we couldn’t plead truth was that we couldn’t say that the ad said that
Commissioner Sullivan bombed Martin Luther King’s home. We didn’t think
the ad said that. So the case had to be litigated in the trial
court—and it wasn’t litigated under happiest circumstances for the
defendant, anyhow—but it had to be litigated in terms of whether these
statements made an actionable reference to Commissioner Sullivan.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Truth is a complete defense, is it?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It is a complete defense in Alabama, but there is no privilege beyond that.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Well, how about fair comment? That’s suggested—</p>
<b>[*18]</b>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Only on facts truthfully stated. So under Alabama law
you lose your privilege of comment, as indeed under the laws of many
states, you lose your privilege of comment unless your facts are right.
This, of course, is the rule of the <i>Hallinan</i> case that Circuit
Judge Taft wrote in the nineties and which pretty well determined the
black letter law on this point, and the Restatement in the books.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: But truth is a complete defense?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It is a complete defense.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: And it has to be specially pleaded?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: And it has to meet the charge. It must be as broad as the charge.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Well then, in short, and putting it bluntly,
the reason you couldn’t plead that defense is that some of these
statements were not true.</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: But beyond that—and the point I’m trying to make, Mr.
Justice Stewart—is that the plaintiff was contending that the statement
said that Sullivan had bombed King’s home. Now, it was true that King’s
home was bombed. But it was not true that Sullivan bombed his home, or
that we conceived that anybody in the world in his right mind could
read this to say that Sullivan bombed his home. That was the difficulty.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: To the extent to which the jury passed on
anything, the jury finding, I take it, was this meant that Sullivan
bombed King’s home?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I don’t know, Mr. Justice.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: Well, wasn’t that issue of the identification—</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: We don’t know what the jury thought referred to
Sullivan. The jury did find that the statements referred to Sullivan.
But does that mean that all the statements referred to Sullivan or only
some of the statements?</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: What was the actual submission to them? On the
premise that if they found that any one of these statements, which on
its face was libelous under that rule, referred to Sullivan, they could
bring in a verdict against The Times?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: This issue was not clarified by the charge. The charge
was, you must consider whether the statements refer to—you must be
satisfied that the statements refer to Commissioner <b>[*19]</b>
Sullivan, without referring to which statements, or whether any of the
statements would be enough. I think that leaves us in the position
where there was—we have basis for grievance, really, if any of the
statements are not enough. I think it is a stronger case.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Was the jury also free to believe that all of these statements were false?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It was free, except that the evidence didn’t support such a view.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Was there no submission on this matter at all? No
submission on the matter at all? The jury wasn’t instructed?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: No. We asked for a directed verdict, of course. And our main grievance was that a directed verdict was denied.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Mr. Wechsler, your basic position, if I
understand it correctly, is that under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, no public official can sue for libel constitutionally and
get a verdict with respect to any type of false or malicious statement
made concerning his conduct, his official conduct?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: That is the broadest statement that I make. But I wish
in my remaining time to indicate what the lesser submissions are,
because there are many that I think must produce a reversal in this
case. And I make that submission because of the impact on me of
Madison’s report and other historic material about the First Amendment
as applied to criticism of officials.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: So, to follow this through, it is a logical
conclusion that a citizen would have the right under that broad
proposition to state falsely, knowingly and maliciously that his mayor,
his governor, had accepted a bribe of one million dollars to commit an
official act, and a citizen could not—the mayor could not sue for libel?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: That’s right. What he would have to do is to make a
speech, using his official privilege as mayor, to make a speech
answering this charge. And that, of course, is what most mayors do, and
what the political history of the country has produced, as I should
say, using the words in a different sense, in a common sense, the
American libel law. Not that these actions are brought, but that
they’re not brought.</p>
<p class="P1">And indeed, Madison himself observed that if the law of
libel as it then was had been enforced, we would never have had a
Republic. That has been a point throughout the history of law, that
these provisions are not enforced, and these actions are not <b>[*20]</b>
brought. It’s only when you encounter a monolithic situation of the
sort that we encountered in Montgomery that there is any profit in
bringing the actions.</p>
<p class="P1">But my further points are these:</p>
<p class="P1">First, that even if I am wrong, you have then a situation
here where law should surely attempt an accommodation of conflicting
interests, the interests in protecting official reputation and the
interests in freedom of discussion. But there is no accommodation here.
The qualified privilege rule is one way to work out an accommodation.
Judge Clark in the old <i>Sweeney</i> case suggested limiting the
action to proof of damage. In Massachusetts there are no punitive
damages, and so on. There are all sorts of accommodating <i>via media</i> that are possible but are rejected by Alabama here.</p>
<p class="P1">And then thirdly, on this point, we have of course the
submission—and we think this a constitutional submission—that there was
in this record no evidence sufficient to support a finding that these
particular statements in this particular advertisement threatened this
particular respondent’s reputation in any tangible way. And since that
is the finding which justifies, on this assumption, the suppression of
a constitutionally protected freedom, we submit that the normal scope
of Supreme Court review as to the facts on this obtains, and it’s <i>Fiske</i> against <i>Kansas,</i>
or one of the sedition cases, in which the prosecution failed to make a
record that warrants a finding of the jurisdictional basis for
infringing the federal rights.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: Are we entitled to review the evidence here, short of finding that there was no evidence on the <i>Thompson</i> against <i>Louisville</i>—</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes, I think very definitely, Mr. Justice. I’m not making—we have the <i>Thompson</i> argument. But I think <i>Norris</i> and <i>Alabama</i>—we brought the cases together at the beginning of the second point in the brief—made perfectly clear that this Court—<i>Bridges</i> and <i>California</i>
is the perfect illustration—this Court has the responsibility and the
duty to satisfy itself that the record sustains the basis on which the
constitutional right asserted has been held to be untenable.</p>
<p class="P1">Discrimination, coercion in a confessions case, and here
that fact is the threat of injury to individual reputation. And if
there is no threat of injury to individual reputation on the facts,
then does it not follow under this general principle of the scope of
review that we are entitled to reversal?</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: You are saying that the state fact–<b>[*21]</b>finding cannot relieve us of our function of determining whether the constitutional right was abridged?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Certainly. And, as a matter of fact, I thought, Mr.
Justice Harlan, that in your own opinion in one of the outstanding
cases where you talked about individualized judgment in individual
cases, you were making precisely this point in what seems to me an
analogous context.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: May I ask, in any one of these three arguments, is the size of the award peculiarly important?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: The size of the award is part of our argument on the
evidence, exactly. We say there was no evidence for a finding of threat
or injury. But we add to that that surely there wasn’t any evidence to
sustain a judgment of this sort, which is a death penalty for any
newspaper if multiplied.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: What I really meant was, I take it one of the
things that you think really trespasses upon the First Amendment
rights, apart from everything else, is the extent to which this
practice leaves the jury completely at large in arriving at an award.
Now, my point was, whether that argument is addressed to any of these
three special grounds or all of them. Or is it an independent argument?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: It is a part of the argument on the sufficiency of the
evidence, really. But it is an independent one. We say there wasn’t any
evidence here for any award. But certainly there wasn’t any evidence
for a half a million dollar award. And it is the half million dollar
award that, from the point of view of the press of this country,
carries the hazard, of course, that this case entails.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, I should say in closing that there is a separate submission on the jurisdictional point. I must submit that on the brief.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Mr. Wechsler, what is the fact in the record
about whether The Times knew these statements were true or false?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: The exact facts, Mr. Justice, are that at the time
when the publication was made, The New York Times had nothing by way of
information to indicate that the statements were false. Now, I know
that that is inconsistent with what the Supreme Court of Alabama says.
It says that we had in our files dispatches, stories, from our
correspondents, that would show that the statements were false. But the
record does not sustain that statement.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Then if you accept the Supreme Court of Alabama’s version, we must deal with your broader first ground?</p>
<b>[*22]</b>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: And if we are obliged—</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: But you have to accept the Supreme Court of Alabama’s
version also, Mr. Justice, on the “of and concerning” point, in order
to get to the broad ground, actually, if you start with the narrow
ground and work to the broad ones. Because if there was no evidence
sufficient to relate this publication to Sullivan, I submit we are
constitutionally entitled to reversal even if we knew it was false as a
matter of history.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Then that latter point depends on whether there
was evidence—whether the evidence that Sullivan was the Police
Commissioner and had charge of the police, was responsible for their
actions, is enough to justify a jury in finding that the charge that
the police acted in a terribly bad manner, as indicated, the jury
couldn’t find that that was a charge against Sullivan?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: In this case, on this statement, I most vigorously submit that the answer to that question is that they could not.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Why?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: The reason why they could not is because the record
shows there were 175 policemen, that there was a police chief in
addition to the Commissioner, and there is not the slightest bit of
suggestion here, in my submission, that what the police did they were
ordered to do by Commissioner Sullivan as the City Commissioner with
jurisdiction over the police.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Wouldn’t the jury have the right to determine
that if the police of a city, who were armed with shotguns and tear gas
bombs, go around and throw their weight around with all that, and it’s
shown that the chief of police, the man acted as chief of police, the
Commissioner, wouldn’t that be enough for a judge or jury reasonably to
find that the head of the department was responsible for it,
particularly if it’s charged to be a continuing thing?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Well, it isn’t charged to be a continuing thing in
Montgomery, Alabama, in this document. There are two statements about
the police, and only two. And ringing the campus was practically true.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE CLARK: How about the one, arrested seven times?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I, in stating the case, Mr. Justice, accepted, for purposes of argument, Commissioner Sullivan’s statement <b>[*23]</b>
that when you talk about arrests, you’re talking about police. But
obviously, it is not explicitly put that the police arrested him. I
assume police do make arrests, and that’s all right.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE CLARK: That is paragraph six?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: That is paragraph six.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE CLARK: Each charge was apparently an individual citizen doing this?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE CLARK: This one said, “They arrested him.” An individual, I suppose, couldn’t arrest him. Could they make arrests?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: There are citizen’s arrests, certainly. But I accept
the proposition that that sentence can reasonably be taken as a
reference to police action. I don’t accept the proposition that they
had arrested him, that the “they” who may have arrested him is the same
as the “they” who bombed his home. Obviously, this was a recitation of
all the grievances that this man has.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE CLARK: Four of those were made in this particular town?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes, in Montgomery. Of course, the ad doesn’t say they
were made in Montgomery. But in fact they were made in Montgomery.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE CLARK: Where does Dr. King live?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Well, he at one time lived in Montgomery, as I understand it, but he left, and moved to Atlanta.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE CLARK: At this time he lived in Atlanta?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: At the time of this publication he lived in Atlanta. Atlanta was his home, yes.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE CLARK: At the time of his arrest he lived in Montgomery?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: At the time of the four arrests that the evidence
showed, I believe he lived in Montgomery. It could be that one of those
was after he left, and it could be that the record isn’t certain about
that, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Do you think that the court and jury would treat
these separately? Suppose the document as a whole showed it was
intended to be charged, either by innuendo, insinuation, or direct
express statement, that the police department had <b>[*24]</b> joined
with a bunch of bad people to permit what I would call the offenses
that are charged here. Would you say that if it’s by insinuation and
innuendo, it would not be equally chargeable if you are wrong on your
first big broad ground?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I think that’s a question of whether the innuendo is
proved. And the first thing you have to do in deciding whether it’s
proved is to look at the document and ask yourself whether the document
is reasonably susceptible of being read in the way that the innuendo
charges. I believe this is the way a libel case would normally be
tried. And many courts would rule, I believe, I think most courts would
rule, that this document could not be libelous under the common law of
the United States, because the only references here that could be taken
to refer to respondent are references to police; that that’s too large
a group in the setting of this evidence, 175, to permit the statement
to be read to mean either all policemen or to mean not all policemen
but just the commissioner in charge.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: What difference would it make if he was one of the group, and there are 175 or 200? Do you accept <i>Beauharnais?</i></p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: I distinguish <i>Beauharnais</i> on the ground that it
had nothing to do with official conduct and that the issue with respect
to official conduct was expressly reserved in the majority opinion. It
was deemed by the Court to be a different issue. But if you ask me
beyond that, Mr. Justice, whether I think <i>Beauharnais</i> should be
followed and was correctly decided, I do not. But I do believe it’s a
different case than this and it does involve the state court finding of
danger of violence, which is an important public end and which is not
involved in this situation at all.</p>
<p class="p1">The main distinction I say is, that was not official
conduct. And I can’t believe that in the State of Illinois, where Judge
Floyd Thompson wrote that great opinion, when the City of Chicago tried
to sue for libel and got thrown out on the ground that you can’t libel
a city, I can’t believe that he’d have turned around and sustained that
action if Mayor Thompson had brought the action instead of the city,
and that’s what this was. That’s what this case was.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Mr. Wechsler, was there an issue made out in the
instructions or for the jury to decide about the knowledge of The Times
as to the accuracy of these statements in regard to punitive damages?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Yes.</p>
<b>[*25]</b>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: So the jury was supposed to decide that one way or another?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Well, no. There was an issue made, but it didn’t work
that way. It’s requested Charge 18, which is in the record. The essence
of the charge, of the requested charge, was that the jury—that punitive
damages could not be returned—I’m summarizing, of course—could be
returned only in the event that you, the jury—it’s at page 844 of the
record—are convinced by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the
defendant, The New York Times Company, in publishing the matter
complained of, was motivated by personal ill will, that is, actual
intent to do the plaintiff harm, or that the defendant was guilty of
gross negligence and recklessness, and not just of ordinary negligence
or carelessness, in publishing the matter complained of, so as to
indicate a wanton disregard of plaintiff’s rights.</p>
<p class="p1">That, I think, is as close as we come to this, Mr.
Justice. That request was made and denied. And there is no equivalent
of that instruction in the charge that was actually given.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: No definition of punitive damages?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: No. Well, yes, punitive damages are given to deter the offender and to deter others. But no indication of the—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Of the relevance of knowledge?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: Exactly. No indication that the jury had to find
malice in fact, as libel lawyers talk about malice, in order to justify
a punitive award. That is not in the charge.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: The way the case was tried, it was irrelevant whether they knew it or not? And in the submission to the jury?</p>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: There was in the testimony, of course. The testimony
of Mr. Bancroft was the story from The Times’ point of view. When it
came to the request, I think this is where it came up. Our great
exception was to the ruling that it was libelous <i>per se</i> and,
secondly, to the proposition that there was evidence that it was of and
concerning Sullivan. That was the main contour of the trial.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: You don’t argue at law that punitive damages
are unconstitutional in that they impose a penalty in a civil
proceeding without the burden of proof and safeguards surrounding the
criminal proceedings, and because the purpose of punitive damages is,
as you have said, to punish; you don’t argue that?</p>
<b>[*26]</b>
<p>MR. WECHSLER: No, we have not made that point, Mr. Justice.</p>
<center>ORAL ARGUMENT OF<br>
ROLAND NACHMAN, JR., ESQ.,<br>
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT</center>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: May it please the Court:</p>
<p class="p1">I would like to address myself at the outset to what I
consider to be a sharp difference between Mr. Wechsler’s analysis of
the facts and the facts as I see them. And I would like to do that in
the context that this case is here, obviously, after a jury verdict,
after the case has been before a trial court on a motion for a new
trial, after it has been before the highest state appellate court. And
we do not rely on there being something in the record to support it. We
say there was ample and, indeed, overwhelming evidence to support the
jury verdict. But we do remind the Court at the outset, in view of the
trend of the argument as it has gone up to now, that we are not here,
like in <i>Norris,</i> on a question of whether a judge in a pretrial
proceeding correctly decided the question of whether there was
discrimination against Negroes in the selection of a grand jury panel,
and we’re not here, as in <i>Bridges,</i> on the question of whether a
judge was correct when he decided a contempt proceeding. We’re here
after a jury trial, with all that that means in terms of the Seventh
Amendment.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, on the issue of falsity, which is where Mr. Wechsler
began, I would like to take this step by step as this lawsuit
progressed. A demand for retraction was filed, as it had to be filed
under Alabama law, before the lawsuit began. An answer was received,
and this is in the record.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: I don’t want to disturb you, but you made a
rather provocative statement I would like to ask you about. You said a
jury trial in terms of the Seventh Amendment.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Is it your idea the Seventh Amendment applies
to the states by the Fourteenth? Is that part of your argument?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: <i>CB &amp; Q</i> v. <i>Chicago,</i> which we have
cited in our brief, Your Honor, and many other cases, say the
protections of the Seventh Amendment which surround the re–examination
of jury verdicts apply equally to state jury verdicts as they do to
federal jury verdicts. That was the point that I had in mind, sir, yes,
sir.</p>
<p class="p1">The answer to the demand for retraction admitted at the
outset that one of the serious charges contained in the ad was false,
namely, that the dining halls had been padlocked, but there was a
refusal <b>[*27]</b> to retract. This refusal to retract came, the
evidence shows, after an investigation made by a string correspondent
in Montgomery, in which he outlined the falsity of these charges. There
was still a refusal to retract. Then the lawsuit was filed, and after
certain procedural matters were out of the way, motions to quash and a
demurrer, The Times filed six separate pleas to the complaint. Not one
of these pleas, not one of the six, had the slightest suggestion in it
that this ad was true in any particular.</p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Wechsler made the argument that it might be difficult
for The Times to plead truth because it might have to spell out its
theory that there was some question in its mind as to whether the ad
applied to the plaintiff. But we would like to call the Court’s
attention to the scope and detail of one of the pleas, plea six, which
appears on page 102 of the record, a plea which extends for almost
three and a half pages of the printed record of this case, a plea which
sets out the entire law of New York on libel, cites statutes as well as
judicial decisions, on the theory that the law in New York as a matter
of choice of law should be applied to this case.</p>
<p class="p1">There was no difficulty in pleading truth in this case,
we submit. If The Times had felt this ad was true or any part of it was
true, it could have set that out in its plea. But it did not do so. It
did not suggest in any one of its pleas that any part of this
publication was true.</p>
<p class="p1">Then we move to the trial. We have excerpted in the appendix of our brief in opposition to the petition for <i>certiorari,</i>
on page 48 we have excerpted ten examples of comments made by counsel
during the course of the trial, suggestions to witnesses and comments
to the court in the course of objections to evidence, and so on,
suggestions in the presence of the jury, if it please the Court, that
this ad was false.</p>
<p class="p1">An example, if I may be indulged in reading:</p>
<blockquote class="P1">Isn’t it a matter of common knowledge in and around Montgomery that what we have been reading from this ad is not true?</blockquote>
<p class="p1">This was to a witness, page 625 of the record.</p>
<blockquote class="P1">Answer: Yes, sir, they know it’s not true.</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Another example:</p>
<blockquote class="P1">You didn’t believe it to be true when you read it, did you, Mr. Kaminski?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="P1">Answer: No, I didn’t think Commissioner Sullivan would do that.</blockquote>
<p class="p1">That’s at page 638 of the record.</p>
<b>[*28]</b>
<p class="p1">Another example, to another witness:</p>
<blockquote>You didn’t believe that it was true, did you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Answer: I knew it wasn’t true.</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Another question to the same witness:</p>
<blockquote>You never thought it was true or had any idea it was true?</blockquote>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: What are you talking about now? What was true?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: I’m addressing myself to Mr. Wechsler’s argument that this ad is inaccurate in certain particulars, Your Honor.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Let me ask you this. I don’t know what
references you are making, but if the witness were asked, “Would you
believe it true that Mr. Sullivan bombed Mr. King’s home?” I assume the
answer would be, “No, I would not believe it is true.” Is that the type
of questioning you have reference to?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: No, sir. The type of question I have reference to is
whether the ad, the words in the ad—I’m addressing myself to Mr.
Wechsler’s contention, as I understood it, sir, that this was only
incorrect in some particulars. I’m saying that what went to the jury
was an admission, really, by counsel for The New York Times, from the
very outset of this case, from the pleadings, from what happened during
the trial, and from the evidence—which I will get to in a moment,
sir—that this was false not just in some particulars, but completely
false, and there was no attempt made at the trial by The Times to say
that any of this was true.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: I looked over the record, and I thought there
was evidence at the trial which showed the truth in part of some of the
allegations of the ad. There were some inaccuracies, as I read the
record, in the ad, and it’s correct there was no attempt to show that
Mr. Sullivan bombed the home, et cetera. But I didn’t read the record
to do what you now are saying, in saying that the ad at large and every
sentence of it was totally and completely false. Are you arguing to us
the case went to the jury on the posture that this ad was from
beginning to end totally false?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: You are?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: I am not saying that there was no attempt made by The
Times to justify it. As a matter of fact, as Mr. Wechsler here pointed
out, Mr. Bancroft, the Secretary of the corporation, who was there at
the counsel table throughout the trial, on <b>[*29]</b> cross–examination stated that he thought it was substantially correct, with the exception of the padlocking statement.</p>
<p class="p1">What I am saying, sir, is that there was evidence from
The Times itself, from its pleadings, from statements of its counsel,
from evidence in the case, in addition to this, which could justify a
jury verdict that the entire ad was false. And as I began by saying,
this case comes here, obviously, after a jury verdict. And I am saying
that there is evidence in the record that the entire ad was false.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: By “the entire ad” you mean paragraphs three and six?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Excuse me. Yes, sir, the two paragraphs we complained
of, Mr. Justice Stewart. The second paragraph and the sixth, I believe.
I didn’t mean to address—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: I don’t follow all these references to the
statements of The Times’ counsel. Are you suggesting that whatever he
may have said, whatever you want to put on it in the way of
interpretation, that this was evidence for the jury to consider?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir. He brought out questions from these witnesses
that this isn’t true, and the witness said, “No, it isn’t,” and this
went to the jury. We say that’s evidence to support a finding of
falsity on the part of the jury, not just falsity in part but falsity
completely.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re not saying that The Times at some point did not
seek to justify it, as indeed with Mr. Bancroft’s statement. What we
say is, here is evidence which went to a jury on complete falsity, not
just partial falsity.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: May we re–examine that?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: We say no, sir, unless there is no basis whatever, it’s devoid of reason—the <i>Thompson</i> test.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: You mean re–examine the facts?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Correct, sir. In other words, we say that the Seventh
Amendment protects this verdict unless this Court finds there’s no
reasonable basis whatever for it, no evidence at all to support it. <i>Thompson</i> versus <i>Louisville</i>—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: The Seventh Amendment?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir, the Seventh Amendment.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: A state trial?</p>
<b>[*30]</b>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: A state trial—the jury verdict re–examined otherwise in
accordance with the rules of common law, which, as we understand the
decisions of this Court, protects state verdicts as well as federal
verdicts.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: I suppose if it’s your assertion—which I gather
it is—that libel falls outside the protection of the First Amendment,
that someone has to finally decide what libel is that falls outside the
protection of the First Amendment?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: The jury isn’t the final answer on that, I suppose?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: You mean the characterization of the ad as libelous?
Your Honor, that was a question that the court decided, but there we
say that that is a question of state law.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: That we can’t re–examine here as a constitutional question?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Your Honor, I would answer that in two ways. Up to now,
as we read the cases, the Court has left the characterization of
publications as libelous or not libelous to the states. Now, we would
certainly concede that if a statement was made that somebody had blond
hair and a state court held that this statement was libelous <i>per se,</i>
well, of course this Court could review it. But, adverting to some of
Mr. Justice Black’s observations in his questions, we say that when
this kind of conduct is charged this is within the normal, usual rubric
and framework of libel. It charges them with criminal offenses, charges
which would certainly hold them up to contempt and ridicule and
disapproval, and we think we’re well within the classic definition of
libel.</p>
<p class="p1">We don’t say, sir, in no circumstances could this Court review a state characterization.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS: I read in the charge to the jury that they were
not given the issue of truth or falsity, because the judge charged, at
the bottom of page 823, that this is libelous <i>per se,</i> and then on page 824 he says libelous <i>per se</i>
carries the presumption of falsity and knowledge. And later on down he
says, so, in a case of the kind that we have here, where the court
charges you that this is libelous matter, that this libelous matter is
libelous <i>per se,</i> falsity and malice are presumed.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir. That’s a prima facie presumption. This is not
an absolute presumption. In other words, if a case is libelous <i>per se,</i> that’s enough to get the plaintiff to the jury. This <b>[*31]</b>
does not mean that the defendant cannot introduce evidence to show that
it’s true. But in this case the defendant didn’t even plead truth. I
submit that this is what the court had in mind. It’s a prima facie
presumption under Alabama law, and certainly not an absolute
presumption which cannot be rebutted by the defendant.</p>
<p class="p1">So we say that we come then to the question of the
retraction. Now, as Mr. Wechsler said, The Times retracted the same ad
on the basis of the same demand from the Governor of Alabama. It
refused to do so for this plaintiff, and this, may we remind the Court,
was approximately six months before the trial, and it was, the evidence
shows, after a second investigation had been made, this time by Mr.
Sitton, who was a regular full–time regional correspondent of The
Times, who was stationed in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="p1">He advised The Times that the first paragraph, to use his
words, was virtually without foundation. As to the second paragraph, he
noted the four arrests of Dr. King for speeding and loitering and the
bombing and the fact that he was under indictment for perjury, a charge
on which he was later acquitted.</p>
<p class="p1">The Times in its retraction stated that there were errors
and misstatements in the ad, and accordingly it was retracted. It
didn’t specify that any part of it was true. It retracted the whole ad,
and it didn’t simply apologize. As I say, it stated that there were
errors and misstatements in the ad.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, six months later, almost, when this case came to
trial, The Times, with no plea of truth, with these investigations in
the record, with live oral testimony from witnesses, including the
respondent, that the matters were false, with the judicial admission,
we submit, of a failure to plead truth, which is an absolute defense
regardless of motive under Alabama law, this matter went to the jury
and the jury found that it was false.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, we submit that there is ample support in this
record. We submit that Mr. Wechsler should fail before a jury and
certainly before this tribunal on the question of whether or not there
was ample evidence to sustain a jury verdict of falsity.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, let’s get to the question of the association of the Police Commissioner with these statements in the ad.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: You said, as I understood you, that the
retraction which The Times made at the request of Governor Patterson
admitted that the whole ad was false. Did you say that?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir. It said errors and misstatements, and there
was nothing in the ad, Your Honor, even suggesting, as we recall it,
that there was any truth in the ad.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: They didn’t go that far, as I read <b>[*32]</b> the retraction. I am reading from page twenty of the brief of the petitioner, and that doesn’t say that. It says:</p>
<blockquote>...herewith retracts the two paragraphs complained of by
the Governor. The New York Times never intended to suggest by the
publication of the advertisement that the Honorable John Patterson was
guilty of grave misconduct or improper actions and omission. To the
extent that anyone can fairly conclude from the statements in the
advertisement that any such charge was made, The New York Times hereby
apologizes to the Honorable John Patterson therefor.</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Is that the statement you have reference to?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: That does not go as far as you said.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: We read that, Your Honor, and the qualification there
as a question of reference, not the underlying statements in the ad. We
say that that statement qualifies on the question of whether or not
this ad can be read as referring to Governor Patterson, not as to
whether or not the underlying subject matter of the publication itself
is true or false. That was the basis for my statement that there’s no
attempt made to say that any of this ad was true. They simply say: We
don’t think it can be read to refer to Governor Patterson, but we’re
retracting anyway, so to speak.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: But you can’t infer from this that it said it was false.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: The errors and misstatements, Your Honor, I think are different ways of saying that it’s false.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: What they merely say, as I read it—unless I
read it improperly, Mr. Counsel—is, with respect to this ad, they never
intended to impute misconduct to Governor Patterson.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: What page is this?</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Page twenty of the brief for the petitioner.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: Of September 9?</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Filed September 6.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: If I might, sir, could I call your attention to page
596 of the record, about midway down. It is just before Folio 1715:</p>
<b>[*33]</b>
<blockquote class="P1">Since publication of the advertisement, The
Times made an investigation, and consistent with its policy of
retracting and correcting any errors or misstatements which may appear
in its columns, herewith retracts the two paragraphs complained of by
the Governor.</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Now, we say that there is no qualification there as to
any part of those paragraphs being true. The clear implication is that
both paragraphs, to use the words, were erroneous or misstated. They
were exactly the same two paragraphs that this plaintiff complained
about, and we say, as the Alabama Supreme Court said, if it was false
for Patterson it was equally false for Sullivan, and this went to the
jury on the question of falsity.</p>
<p class="p1">On the matter of association, we certainly feel that—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: I don’t want to keep you from pursuing this,
but then there was testimony, as I read the record, with respect to
this retraction by Mr. Bancroft.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: That’s right, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: And he explained, I take it, the circumstances
of the retraction, in which he, as I remember it, said that by reason
of the Governor’s high position it was not intended to cast any
reflection upon him. Isn’t that correct?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: That’s what he said first before cross–examination, but then he said—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: What did he say on cross–examination?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: On cross–examination he was asked whether the Governor and this plaintiff were not on a par:</p>
<blockquote class="P1">They are put on a par, aren’t they, Governor Patterson and this plaintiff?</blockquote>
<p class="p1">That is from page 779 of the record.</p>
<blockquote class="P1">Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="P1">But there was a retraction for Governor Patterson and there was no retraction for this plaintiff, that’s correct, isn’t it?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="P1">Answer: That’s correct.</blockquote>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Wasn’t that explained on Mr. Bancroft’s
testimony, that he believed that the language with respect to the state
authorities might refer to the Governor, but he didn’t think any of the
language referred to Mr. Sullivan?</p>
<b>[*34]</b>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: That was the first thing he said, Your Honor, but then
he said that they were on a par in this record, and that there was no—I
assume the jury could determine from that that there was no greater
reference, no more precise reference, to Patterson than there was to
the plaintiff in this case.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Would you, referring to the paragraph, state
to us—take paragraph three; what in that paragraph refers to Mr.
Sullivan and what does not refer to Mr. Sullivan, in your opinion?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: In my opinion, everything except the academic
discipline of expulsion from school refers to Mr. Sullivan. We think it
can reasonably be read, in fact irresistibly be read, as describing
“police action” resulting from the “singing of My Country ‘Tis of Thee
from the capitol steps,” and Mr. Sullivan conceded at the trial, of
course, that he had no academic disciplinary function, and that this
expulsion, of course, does not refer to it.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: You include the padlocking of the dining room as referring to the police official?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir. It’s a clear sort of police action, especially in view of the earlier reference to police in there.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: What about this? Read the whole sentence:
“when the entire student body protested to state authorities.” Do you
get an implication from that that something was done by the state
authorities?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Your Honor, municipal authorities can reasonably be
construed by a jury to be state authorities, too. They’re police
authorities within a state. We don’t say that a reasonable argument
can’t be made that state authorities in certain contexts doesn’t mean
police. But again, sir, I return to the context. This is a question of
whether a jury could reasonably make a connotation—and we say certainly
that police authorities in a state can reasonably connote to the
average, ordinary reader, which is the test that the jury has before
it, that these statements have reference to the man who is in charge of
the police.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Why don’t you say that about the expulsion
from school? I presume the police authority could expel them from
school.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: We simply don’t because the respondent conceded at the
trial that he had no jurisdiction in that regard and made no contention
whatever at the trial that that particular statement referred to him.</p>
<b>[*35]</b>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Does he have jurisdiction to padlock the school?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: He would in certain circumstances where peace and order were threatened, I am sure he would.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Would you refer to paragraph six and point out there what you think referred to Mr. Sullivan, please?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Your Honor, in paragraph six, we would like to advert
to an observation which Justice Clark made, and which was, I thought,
was rather notably underplayed in Mr. Wechsler’s argument—the repeated
use of the word “they.” Here I am not simply relying on my analysis or
a hypothetical analysis. I asked on cross–examination a witness for The
Times, Mr. Aaronson, whether the “they” as used repeatedly in this
paragraph referred to the same persons, and after some backing and
filling he stated that it did or could be read that way. Now, this
evidence went to the jury, and it is our contention that an ordinary
reader of normal intelligence knows that the people who arrest for
loitering and speeding are the municipal police. There is no attempt
made in this paragraph to differentiate in any manner the “they” who
arrest for loitering and speeding from the “they” who bombed and the
“they” who assaulted and the “they” who indicted for murder.</p>
<p class="P1">We don’t say that this is an irresistible connotation in
all contexts. We not only say it is a reasonable one, but that it was
indeed made by The Times’ own witness, Mr. Aaronson, who had had more
than twenty years’ experience in a screening process of this kind of
editorial–type ad, as The Times describes it.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: I’d like to ask what I asked Mr. Wechsler.
Since the advertisement as a whole refers to southern violators, and
since your client testified that the community itself was libeled,
since there are many, many law–abiding citizens in the South as well as
some who are not law–abiding, as in all sections of the country, what
would prevent, under your theory of the case, any citizen in the South
saying that, “I am libeled by this ad of The Times,” and by innuendo
then to allege and go to the jury on the assumption that, I am a
southern citizen, this refers to southern violators, the “they” means
that I bombed, that I did all these things?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: The thing that would prevent it in Alabama, Your Honor, is Alabama jurisprudence, which requires—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: What in Alabama jurisprudence?</p>
<b>[*36]</b>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: —which requires that a group be sufficiently small that
the identification can readily be made, and that a person in an entire
community under Alabama law would not have standing to sue because the
diffusion of the attack, the diffusion of the invidious remarks, would
be so great that under Alabama law it could not be applied to this man
as a member of the community with no other identification as a
plaintiff in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Would Alabama law prevent a suit for libel if
an ad were published which said every citizen of Birmingham is a thief
and scoundrel and a crook?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: I think it would.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: You couldn’t sue as a citizen of Birmingham?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: The cases which the Supreme Court of Alabama has cited
repeatedly in these matters, as we construe them, require, as we submit
most states do, that where you have this area of group libel, the group
has to have a bound—and, in Alabama, reasonably small bounds—in the
context of your question, Your Honor. I think a member of the community
could not. But I don’t think we have that question in this case. I
think that the association is certainly clear enough. We think it’s
very clear, but certainly it’s clear enough to warrant a jury finding
that the charges of this sort about terrible and indefensible police
action reflect on the man who is police commissioner of the city, and I
don’t think we need to go beyond that. I think it sufficient unto the
day if this matter arises, but I don’t think it would arise in Alabama
because of the court’s restrictions in this matter.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Within your Alabama law the police
commissioner is one of the commissioners of the city. Can any public
official involved in a command position in the police department sue
under your theory of the case?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: The question was asked earlier about the police chief.
I would say that he could, yes, sir, although I do say that an elected
official, such as a commissioner, has a larger notoriety and
identification. I think that when something goes wrong in a massive
sort of way like this, that people think of the mayor and the council.
They’re the ones who are supposed to run the city, and when something
like this happens, they are the ones that people think of, and
especially at election time and that sort of thing. But I would think
that the police commissioner could.</p>
<p class="P1">In answer to an earlier question, I would reaffirm what Mr. Wechsler said. The statute of limitations has run. It’s one year in <b>[*37]</b> Alabama, and there has been no suit by the police commissioner.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: Is there any evidence to prove special damages?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: To this extent, Your Honor. One of the witnesses
testified that he was a former employer of Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan,
as the record shows, had formerly been in the Public Service Commission
of Alaska, in the transportation safety field, and after he left there
and before he was elected Commissioner he had worked for a truck line
in a similar capacity. And this man testified, his former employer,
that if he had believed the matters contained in this ad, that he would
not re–employ Mr. Sullivan. We think that this kind of thing certainly
enabled the jury to find that in the future, long after this man could
come back into court and ask the jury to give him some special damages,
that he might be damaged specially in this regard.</p>
<p class="P1">But in the sense of showing any actual out–of–pocket loss
of money at that time, no, sir, there was no showing of that. But we
submit that the jury could fairly take into account future losses of
earnings of that sort if the occasion arose, and of course we also— I
don’t know to what extent Your Honor would refer to what we call
general damages, that is, damages for injury to reputation, for hurt
feelings, for that sort of thing. That is also allowed in Alabama, and
that is different from what I have just described as special damages.
And then, of course, in addition to that there are punitive damages.</p>
<p class="P1">I would like to remind the Court that under Alabama law
there is a very broad retraction statute. I understand from, I believe
it’s Mr. Chafee’s article, which we have cited in our brief, that
Alabama and Virginia were two of the earliest states which enacted
these retraction statutes, and that a defendant in Alabama can
eliminate entirely special and general damages, as I have described
them, by retraction. The Times, we submit, has done this in the
Governor’s case. It refused to do it in our case, and if The Times had
done it, if The Times had done for this plaintiff what it did for
Governor Patterson, it would not be in the situation in which it finds
itself today.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: You say the retraction takes out of the case special and general damages?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: But leaves the punitive, is that it?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Excuse me. I beg your pardon. It takes out punitive and general and leaves in special. I am glad you corrected <b>[*38]</b>
me on that. We have cited the statute on page 68 of our brief. It is
Title VII, Section 915, and makes actual damages only recoverable where
there has been a retraction.</p>
<p class="P1">We submit that this, plus the Alabama defense of fair
comment, plus the absolute defense of truth in Alabama, are means which
Alabama, within not only the constitutional command of the United
States Constitution but the command of its own Alabama Constitution—the
accommodation which Alabama seeks to make with the freedom of the press
and freedom of speech.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Do you happen to know how many states have that retraction statute now?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: No, sir, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not. I believe there are a good many, sir, but I couldn’t say exactly how many.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: I would like to refer to your retraction point
of view. Would you look at the ad again. Suppose the ad in paragraph
three had merely said, the police were called to the campus; the
leaders were expelled from school and the police were called to the
campus, police armed with shotguns and tear gas, and ringed the campus,
which I understand is correct. Police were called to the campus. Do you
deny that?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Your Honor, there are two reports. Mr. Wechsler talked
about one of them. The first report, the report from McKee, the
stringer, said that a passing police car came by. Mr. Wechsler stressed
a later investigation which they asked, I believe, a month or so later,
which said at one time they were deployed in large numbers.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Let us assume the ad was written in that way
and in all other respects remained the same. Would you regard your
client to have been similarly libeled and calling for a retraction in
the terms that you have just described?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: May I be sure I understand the question correctly?</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: In other words, the ad remains exactly as it
is, but instead of saying that truckloads of police armed with shotguns
and tear gas ringed the Alabama State College campus, suppose it said
in place of that language that police were called to the campus, and
everything else remained the same.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: I certainly would contend that a retraction was in
order, Your Honor. I think that a great deal more of the ad than that
one sentence applied to this plaintiff.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Putting that sentence aside, where <b>[*39]</b>
do you find that anything else applies to your plaintiff? Putting that
aside, if that is not the linkage, where are the allegations relating
to your plaintiff that you could make by innuendo?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: The first paragraph; the third paragraph. The first one
that we complain about, other than the unprecedented wave of terror in
the preamble—we think that the padlocking does refer to the police.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: You would say that when police were called to the campus the padlocking then referred to the police?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: That’s right, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: What else?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Then in the other paragraph, as I have stated, the
repeated use of the word “they”; Mr. Aaronson’s testimony that the
“they” refers to the same people who arrest for loitering and
speeding—that’s the police—the same people who did that either
participated in or condoned the bombing and the rest of it.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Let me ask you this: Assuming the reference to
truckloads of police armed with shotguns is eliminated from the ad and
there was no reference to that, what would your position be then?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: That was the question I attempted to answer before. I still think that the—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: No, it wasn’t, because in the hypothetical I
said police were called to the campus. I am now giving you a different
hypothetical. I am giving you one that eliminates that entirely and the
ad remains otherwise the same.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: I would take the same position, Your Honor, and I would be in accordance with Mr. Aaronson of The Times.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: You would take the position your client is still libeled?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir, I would. Not as much, possibly, but certainly
he is libeled, and certainly the reference, we submit, is clear enough
for a jury to find, especially when there is testimony from the
defendant’s own witness that the association was made through the
repeated use of the word “they.”</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Even though “police” is not referred to anywhere?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Well, “police action,” we submit, is clearly <b>[*40]</b>
described, and we don’t think, Your Honor, that you’ve got to say the
police arrest in order to contend that “arrest” refers to the police.
We think that if you use the test of what a normal, intelligent reader
understands, that a normal, intelligent reader understands that arrests
are made by the police. An argument can be made that private persons
arrest, but this doesn’t mean that a jury as a matter of constitutional
law has to find that arrests in that context doesn’t relate to police.</p>
<p class="P1">On the question of malice and deliberateness, to get to a
matter that Mr. Justice White raised earlier in the argument, we
submit, sir, that there was plenty from which the jury could find
deliberateness. We think that the inconsistent treatment of Governor
Patterson and this plaintiff, the treatment of this plaintiff after
investigations showed falsity, the treatment of this plaintiff by the
testimony of the Secretary telling the jury it was not substantially
incorrect, after his own lawyers couldn’t even plead truth, the failure
of The Times to apply a very rigorous set of advertising acceptability
standards, as they call them—that booklet is in evidence—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: I gather that under the Alabama law it’s the same
as knowing the statement is false at the outset if you refuse to
retract after you know it is false.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: And the jury was given to understand that?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir. And, beyond that, the jury had before it a
deliberate failure of The New York Times personnel, of people who were
put on the stand, who were brought down there and put on the stand by
the defendant, two of its three witnesses—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: So you are saying this case unavoidably presents
the question of whether or not a person may tell a deliberate lie about
a public official. Is that the issue?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: No, sir, that is not the issue.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Doesn’t it present that question under the First Amendment, whether you may publish a deliberate lie—</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: —about a public official?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: We think that the defendant, in order to succeed, must
convince this Court that a newspaper corporation has an absolute
immunity from anything it publishes. And, in answer <b>[*41]</b> to
one, I believe, of Mr. Justice Stewart’s questions, as I understand
their contention and as I understand what they said it to be, if a
newspaper charges, say, a mayor or police commissioner with taking a
bribe, that there is absolute immunity against a libel suit in that
regard. And we think that’s something brand new in our jurisprudence.
We think that it would have a devastating effect on this nation.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: But if it were held here that a newspaper could
publish a falsehood which it thought to be true, that would still not
save The Times here?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: You mean a reasonable belief in truth?</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Yes.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: No, sir, not under Alabama law. It would have to be true.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: But on the facts of this case you say they knew it was false or essentially false?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir, we say that on the facts of this case there
was ample evidence from which a jury could find that there was the kind
of recklessness and abandon and inability to look at facts at the
beginning before publication, which could be the equivalent of intent.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Don’t you also say that the failure to retract after learning of the falsehood—</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Later, after knowledge came. But I say even before that
they have, as I was going to say, these advertising acceptability
standards. They’re supposed to screen these ads under newspaper
procedure, not under Alabama law, but under the procedure that The
Times has set up. They brought down presumably the two people under
that screening process, who were supposed to look at this ad and see
whether it passed muster under the libel laws, among other tests. The
first man said he scanned it hurriedly —this is Mr. Aaronson—and didn’t
find anything offensive in it. I even asked him whether he found any
extravagant or superlative language, and he said he did not, even
though the ad uses the phrase “unprecedented wave of terror.” And then
the man who is in charge of the department, Mr. Redding, who was in
charge of the advertising acceptability department, was put on the
stand, and he said he didn’t do anything at all. He didn’t check with
any of the signers of the ad.</p>
<p class="P1">The Times specified in answers to interrogatories 16 separate news articles which related to the subject matter purportedly des–<b>[*42]</b>cribed
in this ad. We asked that specific question. They specified 16 stories,
and Mr. Redding said he didn’t look at one of them before this ad was
sent on for publication. And so at that stage we say there was a
recklessness that was the legal equivalent of intent. And then, beyond
that, as Mr. Justice Stewart points out, we have the retraction for one
and not for the other in precisely similar circumstances. And that’s
the case that went to the jury. And certainly the intent, we submit, of
the author of this ad, the man who wrote it and sent it in and paid
almost 5,000 dollars to have it published as a paid ad in The New York
Times—that man certainly intended, as he testified unequivocally, to
make this ad as devastating as possible, because the purpose of the ad
was to raise money, and he wanted, to use his phrase, to make it as
appealing as possible.</p>
<p class="P1">We submit that this Court and no other court has ever
made a distinction between libel of public officials and libel of
private persons. Public officials, as this Court pointed out in <i>Pennekamp,</i> have a right to sue for libel when they have been defamed.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Where in the record is there any way of finding
out what the jury found about the question of knowledge of falseness,
or any other Alabama court about the question of knowledge?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Your Honor, under Alabama practice a jury has a right
to bring back a general verdict, as distinguished from the federal
practice. The Times, and I think the individual defendants, asked for
special verdicts, but the court—we’ve cited several Alabama verdicts in
our brief that say that under Alabama practice a jury has a right to
bring back a general verdict, and there is no special verdict in this
case and I know of no way to determine what they deliberated on.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Did the Alabama Supreme Court feel it was
necessary to sustain the verdict to announce its own conclusions about
whether The Times was guilty of malice?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir. The Alabama Supreme Court made a specific
finding that there was evidence in the record from which malice could
be found.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Did they find it?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir, they found it. They found that the matter
involving Mr. Bancroft—and I am reading from 273 Alabama 686: “On the
other hand, during his testimony it was the contention”—the Court had
mentioned this retraction that we discussed—</p>
<b>[*43]</b>
<blockquote>. . . of the Secretary of The Times that the advertisement
was ‘substantially correct.’ In the face of the cavalier ignoring of
the falsity of the advertisement, the jury could not but have been
impressed with the bad faith of The Times and its maliciousness
inferable therefrom.</blockquote>
<p class="P1">In other words, once all of the facts were on the table
from the very early investigations, through the retraction, through the
conduct of The Times attorneys in the trial, where they conceded
falsity, the Secretary nevertheless, and in the face of all that, told
the jury that this was substantially correct.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Did the plaintiff ask for a charge?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: The plaintiff asked for no charge.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Any charge at all?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: No, sir.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Could the plaintiff have asked for a charge that “We the jury find all the issues in favor of the plaintiff”?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: I don’t believe that would be permissible.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Is that normal practice?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: I don’t believe that would be permissible, sir. Plaintiff could have asked for a directed verdict.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Is it normally the practice that, if the
plaintiff did not want to take the risk of a general verdict with
reference to some of the issues, he could have asked the court to
charge the jury, “We the jury find all of the issues in favor of the
plaintiff,” and under those circumstances it would have foreclosed all
issues, where a general verdict might not? Has that rule been abandoned?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: I don’t know, sir. I am not prepared to say. I have never done it, and I have never seen it done.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: It was formerly the practice. I know from experience.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: But in this case there was no requested charge from the
judge to the jury. In this connection, we would like to point out
again, in answer to some of Mr. Justice White’s questions to Mr.
Wechsler with regard to the charges, that there were very precise
exceptions made to the oral charge by the defendant <b>[*44]</b> New
York Times, and none of them related to any of these matters. We submit
that certainly at this stage The New York Times could not contend that
there is any deficiency in the oral charge which the judge gave to the
jury. Indeed, he makes no such argument in its brief and in this Court.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: Incidentally, if you hadn’t asked for 500,000
dollars but for five million, and the jury had come in with five
million, I take it on this record you would still be entitled to it?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Your Honor, on that, as we have argued in our brief, as
we understood the cases of this Court, it has not heretofore gone into
the question of the excessiveness or inadequacy of damages.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: You mean on the basis of the constitutional level.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir, under the Seventh Amendment. The <i>C, B &amp; Q</i>
case which I cited earlier was a case in which one dollar was brought
back in a condemnation case, a railroad. This Court held that it would
not go into the question of the adequacy of that award.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: Would that case square with our holding in <i>Haynes,</i>
where we said this Court could examine into the facts where federal
constitutional rights are involved, even where there is a jury verdict?
There is an expression in the case you cite, but I would like to
venture to suggest that perhaps that case of rather ancient vintage
doesn’t still hold.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: The latest case on this question of damages that I know of is <i>Neese</i> against <i>the Southern Railway,</i> where this Court expressly refused or declined to go into this question.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG: I am challenging the breadth of your statement.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: I was going to say, Your Honor, that we will concede
that at some point you get into a question of whether there is any
evidence at all, the <i>Thompson</i> against <i>Louisville</i> test, so to speak.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: Why 500,000, but not five million? I don’t follow.</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Well, we think that if this Court went into the
question at all, as we submit it has not heretofore done, the question
would be whether there was any reasonable basis whatever <b>[*45]</b>
for this verdict. In our brief we have pointed out citations, a New
York verdict seven times this big, three and a half million dollars.
Since we wrote the brief, it has been cut to 350,000 dollars by the
appellate division.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: What kind of case?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: <i>Falk</i> against <i>Aware.</i> It was a case in which the publication—</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: A libel case?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: Yes, sir, a libel case. It was a libel case, and as I
say there was a three and one–half million dollar award in this case.
And The Times itself on the issue of reason said that this has a
healthy effect.</p>
<p class="P1">We submit that in the context of this case a small
verdict would have been a bagatelle. It would have been a slap on the
wrist to The Times for this sort of conduct, even if you consider this
as being entirely punitive damages.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK: That verdict wasn’t against The Times, was it?</p>
<p>MR. NACHMAN: No, sir, it was against a much smaller publication
with, I think, a circulation of about 2,000, a publication with
obviously nothing like the prestige that this ad carried—“All the News
That’s Fit to Print” and all the rest of it. We think that that all
impelled a large and substantial verdict in this case, which the jury
awarded.</p>
<p class="P1">Thank you, sir.</p>
