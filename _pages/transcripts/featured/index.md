## October Term 1947

The [Parker v. Illinois](/transcripts/pre-1968#1947-062) case is interesting because it featured a
*pro se* litigant who was also not a lawyer.  It's also unclear to what extent the Court was aware
of this fact, because there's this curious exchange near the end of the argument:

> **JUSTICE RUTLEDGE**: Mr. Parker, I would like to ask one question and I would like to state
it very carefully and have you answer it just as I put it.

> **MR. PARKER**: Yes, sir.

> **JUSTICE RUTLEDGE**: Does the record show -- I don't want yes or no to anything else -- does this
record show whether you are a member of the Bar or not?

> **MR. PARKER**: I am not. The record shows I am not.

> **JUSTICE RUTLEDGE**: All right.

> **MR. PARKER**: The record shows I am not. Oh, no, I am not a lawyer.

Mr. Parker didn't prevail (although he did garner 3 dissenting votes).  And *pro se* non-lawyers do sometimes
win, as Mr. Sloan did in [SEC v. Sloan (1978)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1977/76-1607).  But Mr. Sloan was the
last non-lawyer to argue at the Supreme Court, and ever since the Court [changed its rules in 2013](https://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2013RulesoftheCourt.pdf#page=40), non-lawyers have not been permitted to argue
their own cases at the Supreme Court.
