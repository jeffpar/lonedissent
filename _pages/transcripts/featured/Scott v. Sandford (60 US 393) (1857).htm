<p>[D<font size="1">RED</font> S<font size="1">COTT</font>, the
plaintiff in error, instituted an action of trespass in the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Missouri, describing
himself as a citizen of the State of Missouri, against John F. A.
Sandford, described as a citizen of the State of New York, for
imprisoning himself, (Dred,) his wife Harriet, and his two children,
Eliza and Lizzy, as slaves, the action being what is commonly called a
suit for freedom. The defendant filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the
Court, alleging that the plaintiff is not a “citizen” of Missouri,
because he is a negro of African descent, his ancestors being of pure
African blood, brought into this country and sold as slaves. The
plaintiff demurred to <b>[*2]</b> this plea, and the Circuit Court
sustained his demurrer, thereby deciding him to be a “citizen,” and
ordered the defendant to plead over. The defendant then pleaded over,
justifying the alleged trespass on the ground that the persons named in
the writ were his slaves; and, after issue joined upon these pleas, the
parties agreed upon the following statement of facts:—</p>
<p>In 1834, Dred Scott was a negro slave, belonging to Dr. Emerson, a
surgeon in the army of the United States. In that year, Dr. Emerson
took the plaintiff from the State of Missouri to the military post at
Rock Island, in the State of Illinois, and held him there as a slave
until 1836. Dr. Emerson then removed the plaintiff to the military post
at Fort Snelling, in the territory of the United States north of 36°
30', and north of the State of Missouri, where he held the plaintiff as
a slave until 1838.</p>
<p>In 1835, Harriet, who was the negro slave of Major Taliaferro, an
officer of the army, was taken by her master to Fort Snelling, where
she was held as a slave until 1836, when she was sold to Dr. Emerson,
who held her as a slave at Fort Snelling, until 1838. In 1836, the
plaintiff and Harriet, with the consent of Dr. Emerson, intermarried at
Fort Snelling. Eliza and Lizzy are children of that marriage. Eliza was
born on board a steamboat, on the river Mississippi, north of the north
line of the State of Missouri; Lizzy was born in the State of Missouri,
at Jefferson Barracks, a military post. In 1838, Dr. Emerson removed
the plaintiff and his wife and children to the State of Missouri, where
they have ever since resided. Before the commencement of this suit, Dr.
Emerson sold the plaintiff and his wife and children to the defendant,
Sandford, who has ever since claimed to hold them as slaves.</p>
<p>Upon these facts the jury, under the instructions of the Court,
returned a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff then sued out a
writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States. The cause was
argued at the December <b>[*3]</b> term, 1855, and was then ordered by the Court to be reargued at the present term upon the following questions:—</p>
<p>1. Whether, after the plaintiff had demurred to the defendant’s
first plea to the jurisdiction of the court below, and the court had
given judgment on that demurrer in favor of the plaintiff, and had
ordered the defendant to answer over, and the defendant had submitted
to that judgment and pleaded over to the merits, the appellate court
can take notice of the facts admitted on the record by the demurrer,
which were pleaded in bar of the jurisdiction of the court below, so as
to decide whether that court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the
cause?</p>
<p>2. Whether or not, assuming that the appellate court is bound to
take notice of the facts appearing upon the record, the plaintiff is a
citizen of the State of Missouri within the meaning of the 11th section
of the Judiciary Act of 1789?</p>
<p>The latter question involved, among others, the inquiry whether the
condition of the plaintiff was changed from slavery to freedom by
residence in the territory subject to the operation of the restriction
contained in the Act of Congress of 1820, commonly called the Missouri
Compromise Act. This drew into the case the constitutionality of that
act.</p>
<p>Mr. C<font size="1">URTIS</font> was retained in the cause, after it was opened by Mr. B<font size="1">LAIR</font>
for the plaintiff in error, for the purpose of assisting in the
argument of this question on behalf of the plaintiff in error, and the
following argument was made by him in reply, after the counsel for the
defendant in error had closed, and after Mr. Blair had also replied.]</p>
<p>M<font size="1">AY IT PLEASE YOUR</font> H<font size="1">ONORS</font>:
—In rising to speak to the single question on which I am to address the
Court in this cause, I may naturally give utterance to the reflection,
that with the political relations of this subject of the power of
Congress over the Territories we here have nothing to do. Whether the
power to legislate <b>[*4]</b> on the domestic and social relations of
life in a Territory, if it exists, ought to be exercised; whether it
ought to be conferred in its plenitude on the people of the Territory
or held in the hands of Congress; whether it ought to be used for one
purpose or thrown into abeyance for another; whether it ought to be
employed for or against the supposed interests or wishes of one class
of States as distinguished from another class,—are matters that will
never aid anybody in determining whether the power is to be found in
the Constitution. This question, with whatever aspects it may go
elsewhere, with whatever influences or elements it may be elsewhere
surrounded, comes into this pure atmosphere of juridical truth to be
debated and decided as a proposition of constitutional law, bearing
upon the rights of parties to a judicial controversy. Treating it in no
other light, approaching it for no purpose beyond the little aid I may
give to the Court in the decision of the cause, I profess myself able
to consider it as a purely juridical question; for, may it please the
Court, I am free to say that if I held the legislative authority of
this Government, or any fraction of it, and had satisfied myself, as I
am satisfied, of the existence of this power, I would exercise it or
refrain from exercising it precisely according to what I believed to be
the exigencies of the particular case; and I would prohibit the
relation of master and slave, or permit or sanction it, according to
the nature of the soil and climate, the character of the present or the
probable character of the future settlers, and according to what I
might believe to be for the interests of the particular Territory.
Acting upon this principle, I should <b>[*5]</b> hope to do something,
though that hope might be vain and illusive, to eradicate from the
public mind those feelings, which in one part of the country lead to a
claim of the power in order that it may be exercised always in one way,
and in another part of the country lead to a denial of the power in
order that its exercise in any way be prevented.</p>
<p>But I hold no part of the legislative power of this Government, and,
by the blessing of Heaven, shall always be free from that
responsibility; and I feel no other interest in this question than that
which every jurist should feel in the true construction of the
fundamental law of his country. As a jurist, I believe that Congress
has full power to prohibit the introduction of slavery into the
Territories of the United States; as a citizen, I can conceive of cases
in which it would be unjust to a portion of the Union to exercise that
power, and in which I never would exercise it. And now, in coming to
the question on which I am to address the Court, I desire to state to
the counsel for the defendant in error (Hon. Reverdy Johnson and Hon.
H. S. Geyer) that they will hear no references from me to the
Constitution “generally.” They have called upon us to point out the
provision in the Constitution which gives this power, and not to assert
it, and then to support the assertion by citing the Constitution <i>passim.</i>
Their call shall be answered. I give them notice that my argument will
be confined to the 3d section of the 4th article; and, if I do not
succeed in satisfying even them that there resides in that section a
legislative power over the Territories adequate and competent to all
the purposes for which Congress has <b>[*6]</b> ever undertaken to use
it, they shall have my free permission to turn their batteries against
those who are in the habit of asserting the power and referring in
support of it to the Constitution “generally.” I do not propose even to
debate the question whether a power to legislate on personal rights can
be derived, as an independent power, from the right to acquire
territory by purchase or conquest. Whatever may be the value of the
suggestion which fell from the great Chief Justice of a former day, (C.
J. Marshall,) in the case of the American Insurance Company <i>v.</i>
Canter, in 1 Peters, (and no suggestion ever fell from him that was
without value,) it is certain that he and the Court over which he
presided, placed the source of the power of Territorial government, for
the decision of that case, in the 3d section of the 4th article of the
Constitution. I may desire hereafter, if the time shall permit, to
consider what is the probable explanation of the language of the Chief
Justice in that case, and to state what I understand to be the
relations between the right of acquiring territory and the power of
governing it. At present what I wish to say is, that as to the source
of the power to govern a territory, or to organize it into what we call
a Territorial Community, or to legislate upon any of the relations of
its inhabitants, whether to this Government or <i>inter sese,</i> my argument will be confined to the 3d section of the 4th article.</p>
<p>I wish, in the next place, to say, may it please your Honors, what
indeed is obvious to every one,—that this is eminently a historical
question. But I shall press that consideration somewhat further than it
is generally carried on this subject, and much further <b>[*7]</b>
than it has been carried by the counsel for the defendant in error; for
I believe it to be true of this, as it is of almost all questions of
power arising under the Constitution, that when you have once
ascertained the historical facts out of which the particular provision
arose, and have placed those facts in their true historical relations,
you have gone far towards deciding the whole controversy. So true is it
that every power and function of this Government had its origin in some
previously existing facts of the national history, or in some then
existing state of things, that it is impossible to approach one of
these questions as one of mere theory, or to solve it by the aid of any
merely speculative reasoning. Hence it is eminently necessary, on all
such occasions, to ascertain the history of the subject supposed to be
involved in a controverted power of Congress, and, above all, to
approach it with the single purpose of drawing that deduction which the
constitutional history of the country clearly warrants.</p>
<p>The first proposition that I shall maintain, then, is the following:—</p>
<p>1. That the last clause of the 3d section of article 4 is by no
means an independent provision, standing by itself, and to be construed
by itself, as both the learned counsel have treated it, but that it was
placed there with a purpose; that it is intimately connected with the
first clause of the same section, and that it embraces a provision
historically necessary to the exercise of the power clearly and
unequivocally granted in the first clause. The whole section is as
follows:—</p>
<p>“S<font size="1">EC</font>. 3. New States may be admitted by the
Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected
within the jurisdiction <b>[*8]</b> of any other State, nor any State
be formed by the junction of two or more States, or parts of States,
without the consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned, as
well as of the Congress.</p>
<p>“The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful
rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property
belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall
be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States or of
any particular State.”</p>
<p>Now, if there is any thing certain with respect to the Constitution,
it is that these two subjects are not placed there by an accidental
coincidence. They are not there in the mere accident of juxtaposition.
They were placed there with a purpose, which it is my duty now to show.
Not to stand here and relate notorious facts, but in the briefest
possible order in which I can place them, I desire to refer to those
great historical events which surround the origin of these provisions.</p>
<p>We know, then, that the vast domains included within the indefinite
and unsettled boundaries of some of the larger States formed the chief
and almost the only subject of contention between the States of this
Union after the Declaration of Independence and during the progress of
the Revolutionary war. We know that no sooner was the Union cemented by
the magnificent cession made by Virginia—“mother of great men,” she has
been called; doer of great deeds she might be called—no sooner had
Virginia ceded to the United States the country north–west of the Ohio,
than the question arose how that country was to be formed into States
and those States admitted into the Union. This question was of
necessity precipitated upon the Union by the deed of cession itself;
for that deed—and I beg our learned opponents to note the
fact—contained an express condition <b>[*9]</b> that the country ceded
should be formed into distinct republican States, and that those States
should be admitted into the Union; so that the United States, from the
moment when they received that deed, stood as trustees to execute these
great purposes. Moreover, it will be found that, in order to enable the
United States fully and completely to effect the purposes of the grant,
Virginia ceded all her “right, title, and claim, as well of <i>soil</i> as of <i>jurisdiction,</i> which the said Commonwealth hath to the <i>territory</i>
or tract of country within the lines of the Virginia charter, situate,
lying, and being to the north–west of the river Ohio, to and for <i>the uses and purposes</i> and <i>on the conditions</i>
of the said recited act.” The recited act was the act of Assembly
passed by Virginia authorizing the conveyance, and declaring the trusts
and conditions on which it was to be made. (Journals of the Old
Congress, IX. 67–69; XI. 139, 140.) The deed was executed on the 1st
day of March, 1784. Mr. Jefferson immediately undertook a measure (in
Congress) to provide for the formation of States in the territory, and
for their future admission into the Union. But the power of Congress to
admit a new State, so originating and so formed, was nowhere to be
found in the articles of confederation. Mr. Jefferson’s resolves
contained a prohibition against slavery in the territory, that was to
operate <i>after the year</i> 1800; but this clause was stricken out.
The resolves, however, were passed, providing for the formation and
admission of States. But Mr. Jefferson has himself informed us, that
there were great differences of opinion in Congress, as to the power to
admit a new State formed in the territory; and that, although his
measure was adopted, <b>[*10]</b> the delegations of most of the States reserved themselves on the question of power to admit a State, and on the rule of voting.<a href="#fn*" name="fnref*">(*)</a></p>
<p>We leave the year 1784 with these facts, and come down to the year
1787. In the interval, encouraged by Mr. Jefferson’s measure, a great
emigration had begun to take place across the Ohio, chiefly from the
Northern and Eastern States. The direction of this emigration after it
entered the Territory, its wants, and the surface and shape of the
country, rendered Mr. Jefferson’s measure inadequate to the purposes it
embraced, and the ordinance of 1787 was prepared and brought into
Congress to take its place. It has been correctly said, on the other
side, that the ordinance embraced two distinct classes of provisions.
One branch of it contained legislation for the establishment of States
and their admission into the Union; the other contained legislation on
the rights and capacities of persons, not only upon this subject of
slavery, but upon many other subjects. Of course the power of Congress
to legislate on any of these interests was no greater in 1787 than it
was in 1784.</p>
<p>We have arrived, then, at the summer of 1787 with these facts—the <i>exercise</i> of a plenary power of legislation by Congress over the Territory, and a complete <i>want</i>
of such power of any express character, or resting on any express
provision. Now, I place very little value upon the mere fact that the
ordinance, as passed by the Congress of 1787, contained a prohibition
against slavery. In my humble judgment this fact, in the argument that
is to prove the power of Congress <b>[*11]</b> under the Constitution,
is not worth the ink that it takes to write it down; for, whether the
fact is used to establish a supposed policy of the founders of this
Government, or as proof of their views, and feelings, and purposes with
regard to this institution, it is undeniable that the Congress which
passed that ordinance had no express, reliable, or ascertainable
authority to legislate on any of the subjects embraced in it. No; the
corner–stone of the whole argument is the want of power in that
Congress; and he who wanders away from this into the region of private
correspondence and individual declarations of feeling or opinion about
slavery, and its destinies and duration, seems to me to desert the
foundation of his case, and to do all he can to weaken his position. I
believe the truth to have been, in point of fact, that the States in
Congress, in 1787, legislated as they did respecting slavery in the
North–western Territory because they saw that the region was likely to
be occupied chiefly by those who were unaccustomed to the use of
slaves, who would not wish for or require them, and would not desire
their presence among them; and, seeing this, the delegations of all the
States in that Congress were willing that the predominating wishes and
interests of the great body of the probable settlers might be consulted
and secured. And I am the more confirmed in this view by the fact that
when other territories came to be organized south of the Ohio, after
the adoption of the Constitution, Congress, seeing that they must
naturally be occupied by those who from custom and interest would
desire this species of labor, undoubtedly sanctioned and authorized the
institution. (See the acts <b>[*12]</b> organizing the Territories of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Orleans, referred to <i>infra.</i>)</p>
<p>But we must take along with us constantly in the investigation of
this subject, that the power of the Congress of 1787, as undertaken to
be exercised in the ordinance, was strenuously denied. Mr. Madison
emphatically denied it in the 38th number of the Federalist, quoted by
my friend on the other side, (Mr. Johnson). Indeed, it is impossible to
examine the articles of confederation, and not to see that the Congress
had no authority to admit a new State formed out of territory not
belonging to the United States at the time those articles were framed.</p>
<p>Quitting the city of New York, where that Congress sat, and coming
to the city of Philadelphia, where the Convention was at the same time
engaged in framing the Constitution, the next historical fact is, that
it was known to the Convention that the Congress had passed the
ordinance. Most persons have contented themselves, in investigating
this subject, with saying that this knowledge must be <i>presumed.</i>
May it please your Honors, it does not rest upon a presumption. A copy
of the ordinance, which was passed July 13, was communicated by R. H.
Lee to Gen. Washington, the President of the Convention, by letter
dated July 15. (Correspondence of the American Revolution, vol. 4, p.
174. Writings of Washington, vol. 9, p. 261.) The ordinance was
published also in a Philadelphia newspaper on the 25th of July,
probably by Gen. Washington’s direction.</p>
<p>Here, then, are the facts that the Congress had passed this ordinance, that they had no proper constitutional <b>[*13]</b>
authority to pass it, and both these things were known to the
Convention. At that very moment the Convention was engaged in framing
provisions to supply this defect of constitutional power. To their
proceedings on this subject I now invite the attention of the Court.</p>
<p>Among the resolutions brought into the Convention on the third day
of its session (May 29), by Edmund Randolph, and which contained nearly
all the germs of the Constitution, your Honors will find the tenth in
these words:—</p>
<p>“10. <i>Resolved</i>, That provision ought to be made for the
admission of States lawfully arising within the limits of the United
States, whether from a voluntary junction of government and territory,
or otherwise, with the consent of a number of voices in the National
Legislature less than the whole.”</p>
<p>This resolution, in every form in which a proposition can be
subjected to the action of a deliberative body, passed the Convention;
and, finally, on the 27th of July, is found among the resolutions sent
to the Committee of Detail for the preparation of a draft of the
Constitution, where it takes its place as the seventeenth resolution,
in identically the same words. The Convention, therefore, had arrived
at this solemn decision, that the new Government was to have power to
admit into the Union two classes of States: one, those which should
“arise” out of a voluntary junction of the government and territory of
parts of the existing States; the other, those which should arise
“otherwise.” Now, what was the actual state of affairs in reference to
which this language was used? On the North, Vermont, in the somewhat
rebellious attitude of an over–grown <b>[*14]</b> boy, was in the
actual exercise of an independent jurisdiction adversely to the State
of New York. On the South–west, Kentucky, of whose matured sovereignty
we are reminded by the benignant presence of my venerable friend, her
Senator, (Mr. Crittenden,) was then just ready, in her stalwart youth,
to be separated from her parent, Virginia. Tennessee was almost
beginning to ask permission to exchange the tutelage of her mother,
North Carolina, for the guardianship of the United States. In the
North–west, the emigration of which I have spoken had already begun to
lay the foundations of that infant society which has since expanded
into five princely and powerful States. To meet this condition of
things power was wanted for the new Government of a double character.
In the first place, power was wanted to “admit” all of these
anticipated and new States, whether arising out of the old States or
arising within the territory. But as to the new States that might be
formed out of a part or parts of the old States, no power was needed to
form them or to determine when they had “lawfully arisen;” for that was
the affair of the old States, to which as settlements they then
belonged. But within the reputed or asserted boundaries of those old
States, and beyond and around the actual settlements, there were
unoccupied lands, claimed, on the one hand, by the United States under
the treaty of peace, and on the other by the States themselves as
successors of the Crown of England under the Revolution. Power was
needed, therefore, to deal with, assert, and dispose of the interest
which the United States then had or might afterwards acquire from the
States in these lands.</p>
<b>[*15]</b>
<p>With respect to the new States that were to “arise” in the territory
north–west of the Ohio, besides the powers I have now described, there
was needed a further and a distinct power, namely, the power to execute
the purposes embraced in the cession of Virginia. It is true that the
United States, before that cession, had claimed title to that country
as well as Virginia; but having invited and received a cession of the
Virginia claim, under an express and solemn undertaking with Virginia
to form the country into distinct republican States and to admit those
States into the Union, the United States must be taken to have waived
their own original title, and to have held the country subject to the
conditions and trusts declared in the deed of Virginia, or at least to
have subjected their own independent title to the provisions and
conditions of that deed. This view of the subject is confirmed by the
fact that when, in 1786, it became expedient to vary the number and
form of the new States contemplated by the original plan embraced in
the cession and in the resolves of Congress, it was deemed necessary to
obtain the consent of Virginia, which was given. (Journals of Cong.,
XI. 139, 140, July 9, 1786.) Power was wanted, therefore—legislative
power—to superintend the formation of States in the territory; to lay
the foundations of society; to protect its growth; to give it law,
order, security; to lead it on from the first crude condition of a
dozen log–cabins to that grand system of human association and
self–sustaining authority that constitutes a State; and when all was
done, and the whole of the vast region should be filled as it is now
filled, to be able, with grateful and patriotic <b>[*16]</b> hearts, to turn to generous and magnanimous Virginia and say to her, “Behold what <font size="1">YOU</font> have enabled us to do.”</p>
<p>These were the objects to be accomplished, and the framers of the
Constitution addressed themselves to their work. Their Committee of
Detail, in the first draft of the Constitution which they reported,
made no provision on this subject, except to declare that “new States,
lawfully constituted or established within the limits of the United
States, may be admitted by the Legislature into this Government” by a
vote of two thirds of each House; that “if a new State shall arise
within the limits of any of the present States, the consent of the
Legislatures of such States shall be also necessary to its admission;”
that “if the admission be consented to, the new States shall be
admitted on the same terms with the original States, but the
Legislature may make conditions with the new States concerning the
public debt which shall be then subsisting.” (First draft of the
Constitution, Art. xvii., Elliot’s Debates, v. 381.) These provisions
embraced neither a power to dispose of the public lands, nor that
legislative power which I have described as necessary to the formation
of new States in the territory. Mr. Madison, with the instant sagacity
that always characterized him, saw the omission and proceeded to supply
the defect. He moved two propositions as additional powers of Congress:—</p>
<p>“To dispose of the unappropriated lands of the United States;</p>
<p>“To institute temporary governments for new States arising therein.”</p>
<b>[*17]</b>
<p>These propositions were referred to the Committee of Detail; but,
before they had reported upon them, the seventeenth article of their
draft of the Constitution was reached and taken up for consideration.
Thereupon various objects, which different classes of the States
desired to accomplish, were at once developed. On the one side were
those who sought for restrictions to prevent the dismemberment of any
of the old States without their consent. This provision was made. Then
came the subject of the vacant lands lying within the asserted
boundaries of some of the old States and claimed by the United States
under the treaty of peace; and the question was, in what attitude the
Constitution was to leave the claims of the United States and the
claims of the individual States? At this precise point, Gouverneur
Morris—surveying the whole field, aiming to comprehend the political
jurisdiction needed for the territory north–west of the Ohio, the power
to dispose of the lands of the United States wherever situated, and at
the same time to leave the titles to unoccupied lands claimed both by
the United States and by individual States without prejudice from any
thing in the Constitution—rose and presented the very clause that now
constitutes the last branch of the third section of the fourth article,
in these words:—</p>
<p>“The Legislature shall have power to dispose of and make all needful
rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property
belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution
contained shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims, either of
the United States or of any particular State.”— (Elliot, v. 492–497.)</p>
<b>[*18]</b>
<p>This proposition was at once adopted with almost universal consent.
It satisfied everybody, and accomplished all that had been suggested,
and which ought to have been accomplished. It was one of those
fortunate achievements of the pen by which a man of great experience
and legislative tact, sitting as if in the centre of men’s minds, and
combining their thoughts and purposes into a single sentence, engraves
the needed provision upon the record by a single stroke, and leaves it
to do its office through all coming time.</p>
<p>Having now established, as I respectfully submit I have, the
connection between the two clauses of the third section, I proceed to
state the second proposition that I am to maintain in this argument:—</p>
<p>2. That the power to “make all needful rules and regulations
respecting the territory” is a power to legislate—plenary; embracing
all the subjects of legislation of which any full legislative power can
take cognizance, subject only to the restrictions which qualify all the
legislative powers of Congress, wherever exercised, with respect to
certain great public and private rights.</p>
<p>I admit and claim that the power of territorial legislation is
subject to these restrictions, which I shall presently enumerate; and I
do so because my learned friend (Mr. Johnson) expended a vast force of
denunciation upon the idea that citizens of the United States, by
quitting a State and going into a Territory, may pass out of the pale
of the Constitution and within the pale of an enormous, unlimited, and
irresponsible power, and so subject themselves to an “inequality.” Now,
<b>[*19]</b> that a citizen of a State, when he emigrates into a
Territory, lays down the character of a citizen of the State from which
he removes, so far as the rights and privileges secured to him by the
Constitution <i>as a citizen of a State</i> are concerned, I believe
to be entirely true. For example, he cannot sue a citizen of another
State in the courts of the United States, <i>by reason of his citizenship</i>,
after he has become an inhabitant of a Territory. But let us see
whether it be true that he subjects himself to an arbitrary and
unlimited power of legislation and government. In the Constitution, as
originally adopted, there are certain very important limitations
imposed upon <i>all</i> the legislative powers of Congress, wherever
they may be exercised, and in the amendments there are many more. The
provisions of the Constitution respecting the habeas corpus, bills of
attainder and ex–post facto laws, titles of nobility, the definition,
evidence, and punishment of treason, and religious tests for office,
are positive restrictions, which Congress can violate <i>nowhere</i>.
I hold the same to be true with respect to trial by jury for crime.
With respect to the rights secured by the amendments, it is clear that
Congress can make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of
speech or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble and to petition for a redress of grievances; that no soldier
can in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of
the owner, nor in time of war but in a manner prescribed by law; that
unreasonable searches and seizures are prohibited, and that warrants
must issue upon probable cause, supported by <b>[*20]</b> oath,
&amp;c.; that for capital or otherwise infamous crimes, there must be a
presentment by a grand–jury; that no man can be compelled to be a
witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law; and that private property cannot be taken
for public use without just compensation; that in suits at common law,
exceeding twenty dollars in value, there must be a trial by jury; that
excessive bail cannot be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor
cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. All these are restrictions
upon all the legislative powers of Congress, and it would be idle to
contend that they apply only to those powers when exercised in the
States. I do not say that they would be applicable to a district of
country conquered from an enemy, while it remained in our military
occupation, or to a place purchased for a military or naval station
without the limits of the Union. I am treating now of “<i>the</i>
territory” contemplated and intended in the third section of the fourth
article, in respect to which I have shown that the framers of the
Constitution intended to provide a legislative power; and I say that if
there is any legislative power whatever provided in the authority to
“make all needful rules and regulations,” it is, like all the other
legislative powers, subject to these restrictions, which declare that
certain things shall not be done, and that certain other things shall
be done.</p>
<p>But to return to the power itself. I submit to your Honors that,
considering the object for which it was to be created, and the
relations between the United States and Virginia under the deed of
cession, it was, <i>a priori</i>, to have been expected that the Convention would <b>[*21]</b>
create such a power as I have described. What was the object for which
the power was to be given? To prepare, in a new and unoccupied country,
“States” for admission into this Union. What is a State? Is it an
aggregation of men living without law? No; it is a political society
founded in social order; and for that order it must be trained. Before
the particular form of the body politic, called in our system a
“State,” is formed, there must be an interval. That interval must be
occupied with the restraints and protections of law. In other words
there must be government; which is only saying that there must be
legislative power. Where shall that legislative power reside? By the
law of nature it is in the individuals settling on the soil of the
territory. But the framers of the Constitution were not legislating to
enact the law of nature, or to carry it out; but to provide a positive
code of political law that should <i>vest</i> somewhere this
legislative power necessary to the wants of a new society. They said,
therefore, this power of legislation shall not reside where the law of
nature would leave it, but in the Congress of the United States. <i>They</i>
shall have power to make all the needful rules and regulations required
to accomplish the work that is to be done: first, because there is to
be an interval during which there must be authority somewhere;
secondly, because there is cast upon the United States, by the cession
of Virginia, the trust of superintending the formation of that region
into States; and, thirdly, because to admit the law of nature to
operate would be to surrender the whole control, municipal government,
corporation, private rights, political relations, every thing out of
the hands of the <b>[*22]</b> United States, who are the trustees under the cession, into the hands of those who are <i>not</i> the trustees. I say, therefore, there were reasons, <i>a priori</i>, for this provision; and this brings me to the phraseology of the clause.</p>
<p>We have had much criticism by both of the learned counsel for the
defendant in error upon the meaning of the word “territory” in this
clause of the Constitution. It is insisted that it means <i>land</i>,
and nothing else. If this be so, the consequence seems to follow, as in
one part of their arguments they have contended, that the power or
powers granted in the section extend to nothing but the disposal of the
soil. How the learned counsel in that case get the right to establish
municipal government or a “municipal corporation,” which they
distinctly admit in their brief, they have not informed us. But I think
that the history of the formation of this clause opens to us the source
of municipal and political government, as well as of the power to
dispose of the soil. The primary and general sense in which the framers
of the Constitution used the term “the territory” was that in which it
was used in the deed of cession, and in which it had always been used
since the cession. They meant by it the region of country ceded by
Virginia to the United States, and they spoke of it as “<i>the</i>
territory.” The United States had no other territory; they did not then
expect to have any other, except such as might be ceded to them by
other States under similar circumstances and for similar purposes. Now,
that the framers of the Constitution intended to use this term in the
clause before us (using it but once) in a sense which admits of its
application to the <i>soil</i>, is manifest from the context. The rule, <i>reddendi singula</i> <b>[*23]</b> <i>singulis</i>,
refers the term “territory” to the power to “dispose of,” and gives it
the signification of land. In that construction the subject qualifies
the power and the power qualifies the subject. The same rule refers the
term “territory” to the power to “make all needful rules and
regulations respecting” it, and gives it the signification of the
country or region belonging to the United States. These terms embrace a
legislative power just as complete, just as efficacious, as if the
words “exclusive legislation” had been employed. But if you say that
they are a mere repetition, in another form, of the power to “dispose
of” the soil, you make them merely tautological; whereas <i>there are no tautologies to be found in the Constitution of the United States</i>.
It would be a violence of construction unwarranted by any thing else in
the instrument to suppose that words of an altogether wider scope and
signification were employed as a bare repetition of the idea of <i>disposing of the soil</i>.</p>
<p>In this connection I wish to notice an objection taken by the
learned counsel (Mr. Geyer) who opened the cause for the defendant in
error. He put to us the inquiry, with great significance, how it
happens, if these words “to make all needful rules and regulations”
were intended to give a legislative power, how it happens that the
framers of the Constitution did not employ the terms “exclusive
legislation,” which they used to establish the authority of Congress
over the District of Columbia and over places that might be ceded for
forts, arsenals, and dock–yards? I think I can tell him. The framers of
the Constitution knew very well that if a seat of government were to be
obtained for the United <b>[*24]</b> States, which they did not mean peremptorily to direct, it must be obtained here, somewhere in the centre of the Union, by a <i>future</i>
cession from a State or States that had always had jurisdiction over
the tract that might be ceded. It was necessary, therefore, to employ a
term which should, by its immediate operation upon the cession, exclude
the possibility of any exercise of State authority after the cession,
and fix the authority of Congress as the sole authority by which the
ceded tract was to be governed. The same was true of the places that
might thereafter be ceded for forts and dock–yards. But, with respect
to the territory north–west of the Ohio, there was no such necessity
for excluding the possibility of State jurisdiction. The jurisdiction
of Virginia, or all her claim and possibility of jurisdiction, had
passed to the United States years before the Constitution was framed.
There was no necessity, therefore, to give effect and operation to the
idea that the jurisdiction of the United States was to be exclusive of
any State jurisdiction. But it was necessary, in order to vest in
Congress a full legislative power to exercise the jurisdiction of the
United States, to use words which would describe such a power; and this
was done by the terms “to make all needful rules and regulations.”</p>
<p>But our learned opponents think that they find in the terms “or other <i>property</i>,” which follow immediately after the word “territory,” conclusive proof that the latter term meant nothing but <i>land</i>.
The simple answer to this is, that it was just as proper to follow the
word “territory” with the expression “other property,” if “territory”
mean the region of country whose soil and <b>[*25]</b> jurisdiction
had been quitclaimed by Virginia to the United States, as it would have
been upon the supposition that “territory” included nothing but the
soil; for, whether this term includes more or includes less, every
thing that it did include was the <i>property</i> of the United
States. It is obvious, however, from the history of the clause, that
the words “or other property belonging to the United States” were used
to extend the powers of disposal and regulation to those other claims
which the United States had within the asserted boundaries of other
States, or might thereafter have under the cessions of other States
besides Virginia.</p>
<p>Having, then, arrived at two results—first, that the clause embraces
two separate but connected powers; second, that one of them, which I
call the legislative power, was intended to effect a great purpose of
national policy in the preparation of new States for admission into the
Union—I proceed to inquire whether that purpose can be answered, by
treating the power as any thing less than what is described by the
words in which it is granted.</p>
<p>And here it is immaterial which branch of the argument the other
side may elect to take. They must admit that the words mean something.
Take first the establishment of governments within the territory.
Congress makes a law having reference to the organization of a
territorial government. Somebody refuses to obey it, under the
allegation that Congress have exceeded their powers by going beyond the
object of the clause; he is prosecuted, and brings his case here by
writ of error. Your Honors look into the Constitution, and find that
Congress has power to make “<i>all</i> needful rules and regulations <b>[*26]</b>
respecting the territory,” and you tell him that the particular law of
which he complains was made respecting the territory in question. But,
says the plaintiff in error, this law was not within the power, because
it was not “needful” in the exercise of the power to erect a
government. Is that a judicial question? Is it a question which your
Honors can decide? What means has the judicial department for
determining it? And yet, if the doctrine contended for on the other
side be correct, your Honors must determine it, either with or without
means; for if the power granted in this section be any thing less than
a full legislative power—if it is confined to certain specific
objects—the question whether the subject of a particular law is within
those objects can only be determined by determining whether the
particular legislation is “needful.”</p>
<p>This illustration shows that the moment you reduce the words below
their natural import and say that they are not applicable to this or
that particular subject, you bring into this Court as a judicial
question one that is not only in its nature a political question, but
one that is made political by the very terms of the grant; for if the
terms of the grant are made to embrace only a few specific objects—less
than <i>all</i> the objects of legislative power—then the question
whether the particular subject of a law is “needful” for the purposes
of the granted power will be identical with the question whether the
subject of the law is within the scope of the granted power. But, on
the other hand, if the words are held to include all subjects of
legislation within the territory, the question whether a particular law
is needful cannot become confounded with the question whether its
subject is within the granted power.</p>
<b>[*27]</b>
<p>Let me illustrate my meaning by supposing another case. The
gentlemen on the other side claim that the power is limited to the
disposal of the land. Very well. Congress pass a law that no land in a
particular Territory shall be sold to anybody but a white man. A
colored man makes an entry, pays his money, and by some oversight gets
his patent. The title descends, gets into dispute, and the case is
brought here. Those who claim under the colored man allege that the law
was not within the power of Congress, because it was not “needful” to
the exercise of the power of selling land; and your Honors must
determine whether it was “needful” in order to determine whether it was
within the particular and special power alleged to be the only subject
of the grant. But let us suppose that Congress has a general
legislative power over all subjects within the Territory, and the same
case comes here. Your Honors’ answer to it will be, “Congress have full
authority to legislate about every thing in a Territory that can be the
subject of legislation anywhere; and the question of the <i>needfulness</i>
of their legislation does not determine the extent of their power. If
you are aggrieved, there are chambers above and a mansion at the other
end of the avenue, to which you must go for relief.”</p>
<p>Now, may it please your Honors, is not this reasoning justly
applicable to the matter of slavery in a Territory, which nobody will
deny to be a subject of legislative regulation, wherever legislative
power exists? Let me press the considerations which I have urged, not
upon the feelings, but upon the judgment of the bench. Are your Honors
to sit here between the contending parties of the Republic, or its
extremest factions, the <b>[*28]</b> pro–slavery and the anti–slavery, and, as their successive projects take the form of legislation for Territories, are <i>you</i>
to determine what is “needful” for the welfare of the country? Is this
bar,—sacred to the high debates of jurisprudence and renowned for them
throughout the world,—to be turned into an arena for political
combatants to discuss questions of social theory, the value, the
dignity, the blessing of this or that form of labor, the equality or
inequality of races, the claims of sections upon the Territories? And
when the wrangle is ended, terminated by your Honors’ rule, or worn out
by its own ferocity, <i>you</i> are to retire, and, by such principles and upon such considerations as you may, <i>you</i>
are to determine what is “needful” for the public good! The idea is
somewhat startling; and yet to this it must come, unless Congress is
admitted to be the absolute, supreme, and final judge of what the
Constitution has committed to its political discretion. I think, Mr.
Chief Justice, when what I have described shall occur, that, speaking
for your brethren and yourself, you would be entitled to say, “W<font size="1">E</font> sit to administer the <i>judicial</i>
power. Go to those who can determine such a question, and who are
entitled to speak the voice of the people. Our voice is the
interpretation of the law; and from that interpretation the
Constitution has withdrawn the question of what is a true policy.”</p>
<p>But it remains for me, before I leave this part of the subject, to
attend to one of the positions taken by the learned counsel (Mr. Geyer)
who opened on the other side. “Creating a municipal corporation,” he
said, “is a different affair from legislating on the rights of
individuals.” <b>[*29]</b> One of them he admits, the other he denies
to be within the power of Congress. Now, in a certain very obvious
sense, there may be a great difference between creating a municipal
corporation and legislating on the rights of individuals. But the
question here is, whether that difference shows that either of them is
not within the granted power? Let us examine that question. What
constitutes the difference with respect to the power? Both are within
the Territory; both are subjects of ordinary legislation; both are
equally restrained or unrestrained by the restrictions of the
Constitution, according as you hold that those restrictions do or do
not extend to the Territories. So far they are alike. Are they not
equally alike in reference to the standard by which the Constitution
places every law respecting a Territory within the judgment of Congress
as to its necessity? The corporation is clearly to be referred to that
standard. Whether it shall be made at all; how it shall be made; how
and when it shall be changed—all this rests in the judgment of
Congress, as to its necessity. Is it any otherwise with regard to the
rights of individuals, except so far as they may be fixed by the
Constitution itself? What constitutes the distinction? If both
corporation and personal rights are within the Territory, if both are
subjects on which legislative power can act, if both are unrestrained
by any special provision of the Constitution forbidding legislation
respecting them, then both are equally to be referred to the standard
of what is “needful,” and that standard is fixed by the terms of the
grant in the judgment of Congress, and nowhere else.</p>
<b>[*30]</b>
<p>The last proposition which I am to request the Court to examine
is,—3. That the objections which have been here urged to the existence
of this power, all resolve themselves into abuses of it, which in no
degree touch the question or define the limits of the power itself. One
of the principal objections to which we have listened is, that if it is
a general legislative power it becomes perpetual. Both the learned
counsel have insisted on this in different forms. My friend (Mr.
Johnson) who closed the case upon the other side, declared with great
emphasis that the power is “not exhausted with the termination of the
territorial existence;” and he cited in proof of this the 8th section
of the Act of 1820, commonly called the Missouri Compromise, by which
Congress undertook to prohibit slavery north of a certain line “for
ever.” The other counsel (Mr. Geyer) spoke of the power as a power of
“dictating the State constitution,” and one that would “make white men
slaves.”</p>
<p>I marvel that two such experienced, able, and distinguished
advocates and jurists, did not see two or three very obvious answers to
this. In the first place, they might have remembered that the very
terms of the grant <i>limit</i> the power to the territorial
existence. And did they not know that even during the territorial
existence there is no potency in the word “forever” that can
irrevocably fasten any line of policy upon any Territory? The
legislation of the last few years shows plainly enough that there is no
magic in that word to prevent its being expunged from the statute–book
at any time; as, indeed, it must be, in any legislation, a term of the
merest surplusage. I marvel, <b>[*31]</b> also, that the learned
counsel did not see that by no exertion of the power in a Territory,
however long continued, can any character be impressed upon the State
constitution which the people of the State, after they have become
such, cannot change in an instant. The learned counsel (Mr. Geyer)
referred us to the attempt that was made in Congress, when Missouri
first sought admission into the Union, to dictate to her concerning a
feature of her constitution. If he referred to the effort made in 1818,
1819, to compel Missouri to form a constitution prohibiting slavery, I
say it in his presence, with all the pain that can belong to one
generation when speaking of the acts of another, that the attempt was
wrong. Congress has no right, when a State asks admission into the
Union, to dictate the provisions of its republican constitution; and,
had I a vote to give on such an occasion, I know of nothing that would
induce me to exclude a new State, whose people, without improper
interference and without fraud, appeared to have voluntarily and
deliberately chosen to have slaves among them. But the learned counsel
should have placed that act of wrong where it belongs, not as an
exercise of the power of making rules and regulations for a Territory,
but as an exercise of the power to admit a State. Of <i>that</i> power
it was an abuse. It was neither an abuse nor a use of the power of
territorial regulation; and its occurrence in history is no more to be
cited as proof that the power of Congress over the Territories is not a
full legislative power while the territorial condition continues, than
it would have been if it had occurred in the exercise of the power to
regulate commerce, or of any other power with which Congress is
invested.</p>
<b>[*32]</b>
<p>As a further proof of the perpetual character of this power, both of
the learned counsel have suggested that its exercise, in a certain way,
upon certain subjects, may leave upon the structure of society in a
Territory consequences that may last for ever, and that this is
contrary to the spirit of American liberty. I beg to know if it has not
been true of all legislative power since the world began, that it has
left upon us some consequences of the manner in which it has been
exercised? Have not all the dynasties that have passed over that branch
of the race of Adam to which we belong left upon us the impress of
their legislation? All that has been done by government, all the former
structure of civilization, all past habits of thought and feeling, all
that has been made and unmade as law, all that has been permitted and
all that has been prohibited, has contributed directly or indirectly to
mould the present form and spirit of society. Are we therefore any the
less free? What is that political freedom which we value above the
rubies and the riches of earth? Is it that we have inherited nothing
from the past? Is it the test of freedom to be able to say that the
legislative power of a former day has left no traces upon the framework
of society? No; the test of freedom is this: that when we have reached
the full stature of a State, and have put on the authority of
independent self–government, we are at liberty to wipe out all that has
come down to us, and to reconstruct society according to the pleasure
of our own sovereign minds. As it has been with us, so will it be with
the people of every Territory that this Government may organize. You
may legislate as you please, you may <b>[*33]</b> construct their
social system as you choose, the day will come, when they take their
place among the sovereign States of this Union, that they will be
absolutely free to undo all your legislation, and to adopt any
condition or form of society that is consistent with a republican form
of government.</p>
<p>I now beg the attention of the Court for a few brief moments, while
I endeavor to state what I understand to be the legislative
construction which the Constitution received at the hands of its
framers and their contemporaries in respect to this power. I shall not
detain the Court long upon the reënactment or confirmation of the
ordinance of 1787 by the first Congress that sat under the
Constitution. There it stands upon the statute–book, and no man can say
that it was not an exercise of legislative power over personal rights
and relations in a Territory. But that was an exercise of power to <i>prohibit</i>
the relation of servitude. I turn from it, therefore, to an exercise of
the power to confirm, to sanction, and to perpetuate that relation. On
the 2d of April, 1790, Congress accepted a cession of the claim of
North Carolina to a certain district of Western territory which has
since become the State of Tennessee. One of the conditions of the deed
of cession was “<i>that no</i> <font size="1">REGULATION</font> <i>made or to be made by Congress shall tend to emancipate slaves</i>.” (Statutes at Large, vol. 1, p. 106.)</p>
<p>I pause for a moment upon this remarkable language. The State of
North Carolina, assuming that Congress has power to regulate slavery in
a Territory, and using the very word which the Constitution employs as
synonymous with law, thinks proper to lay <b>[*34]</b> that power
under a restriction with respect to the Territory of Tennessee.
Congress, by an act passed May 26, 1790, (Stat. at Large, vol. 1, p.
123,) organized a government for the Territory <i>upon the conditions of the deed of cession</i>.
The learned counsel opposed to us will call this a compact. It is no
matter whether it was a compact or something else; it proceeded upon
the assumed principle that, without a restriction, Congress would have
power to <i>regulate</i> the emancipation of slaves. This occurred in
the Presidency of Washington, Mr. John Adams being Vice–President, Mr.
Jefferson Secretary of State, Mr. Hamilton Secretary of the Treasury,
and many of the framers of the Constitution being in Congress.</p>
<p>The next action of Congress to which I wish to refer is that
relating to the Territory of Mississippi, organized by statute of April
7, 1798. The 7th section of that act prohibited the importation of
slaves into the Territory from any place out of the limits of the
United States, leaving, by clear implication, a right to introduce them
from places within the United States. The 3d section of the act made
this implication perfectly conclusive; for it excluded the operation of
the freedom clause in the ordinance of 1787, by an exception which
prevented its application to Mississippi. When the bill was pending in
the House of Representatives, Mr. Thatcher, of Massachusetts, moved to
strike out this exception, upon the ground that the Government of the
United States, having itself originated in and been founded on the
rights of man, could not consistently establish a subordinate
government in which slavery was to be both tolerated and sanctioned by <b>[*35]</b>
law. A very instructive debate ensued upon this motion, but it received
only twelve votes; and the act was passed containing a clear and
unequivocal sanction of slavery by law. (Annals of Congress, 5th
Congress, vol. 2, p. 1306–1312.)</p>
<p>Afterwards, in 1804, (March 26,) comes the act to organize the
Territory of Orleans. This act contained a prohibition against the
introduction of all slaves, “except by citizens of the United States
removing into the Territory for actual settlement, and being at the
time of such removal <i>bonâ fide</i> owners of such slave or slaves; <i>and
every slave imported or brought into the Territory contrary to the
provisions of this act shall thereupon be entitled to and receive his
or her freedom</i>.” I know not how there could be a more direct and
explicit assertion by Congress, both of a power to emancipate within a
Territory and a power to sanction within a Territory, than was here
asserted. The whole subject is regulated in both ways, by prohibition
and by permission.</p>
<p>Here I think that legislative constructions of the Constitution
should cease to be resorted to; for at this point of time we leave the
actual presence of its framers and their contemporary generation.</p>
<p>It only remains for me to submit to the consideration of the Court
the view which I entertain of the right of acquiring territory, and of
the power of governing it when acquired, in order to see whether the
territorial clause, as it is sometimes called, is or is not applicable
to possessions acquired by conquest or treaty with a foreign power,
and, if so, when its application can be said to commence.</p>
<p>It is not probable, so far as I have ever been able to <b>[*36]</b>
ascertain, that the framers of the Constitution, or the people of the
United States at the time of its adoption, expressly contemplated the
acquisition of any territory in addition to that ceded by Virginia
north–west of the Ohio, excepting such as might be ceded by some of the
other States under similar circumstances and for the same purposes.
Although the right to navigate the Mississippi through its outlet to
the sea was, for a long time before the Constitution and immediately at
that time, a subject of national consideration and of actual
negotiation with Spain, it does not appear, so far as I know, that the
people of the United States then contemplated the acquisition of the
country lying at the mouth of the river, or that they looked to the
acquisition of any other foreign territory. The framers of the
Constitution, therefore, shaped the territorial clause (art. 4, § 3)
with reference to the special object of the formation and admission of
new States to be formed out of the territory already within the limits
of the United States, and already ceded by one of the States of the
Union; but at the same time they made it a general provision by
extending it to “other property belonging to the United States;” for
these words, as I conceive, considering their context and the objects
at which the framers of the instrument were aiming, must be construed
to mean other <i>territorial</i> property besides that intended to be described as “<i>the</i> territory,” which meant the particular region north–west of the Ohio.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, we are to remember that this Government
possesses the great national and international powers of making war and
of making treaties. It is the settled doctrine of this Court that these
powers <b>[*37]</b> involve the power of acquiring territory, either
by conquest or by treaty; and upon this ground of right acquisitions
have been made by treaty which have been incorporated into the Union.
To determine the extent and kind of authority which this Government may
exercise over a conquered country, we must look to the law of nations.
Having the power of making a conquest, this Government has all the
powers over the conquered country that are possessed by any nation when
it has made a conquest. It may be governed according to the pleasure of
the conqueror, which pleasure is limited, if at all, only by the usages
of civilized nations in like cases. With respect to a country acquired
by treaty, if the treaty contains any stipulations concerning the
treatment of the inhabitants, the power of the nation receiving the
cession is limited by those stipulations. If the treaty is silent, the
power is the same as in the case of a conquest, and its nature and
limits are to be determined by the law of nations. The power to
acquire, in both forms, is derived to the Government of the United
States from the Constitution. The right to govern after the acquisition
is made is derived from and regulated by the law of nations, and it is
what Chief Justice Marshall described as “the inevitable consequence of
the right to acquire.” (1 Peters, 543.)</p>
<p>From these positions it seems necessarily to follow, that, when the
United States make an acquisition by conquest or by treaty, (if the
treaty contains no stipulations that limit their power,) they may hold
and govern the country acquired in any manner, and for any length of
time in any manner, that they may see <b>[*38]</b> fit, so long as
they choose to keep it in the position of a dependency external to the
Union. They may give it a military government or a civil government, or
no government other than the arbitrary will of a proconsul; and this
power continues indefinitely until Congress shall determine that the
country shall be incorporated into the Union. When that time
arrives—and its arrival is in the uncontrollable judgment of Congress,
in the absence of treaty stipulations—I submit that a change takes
place with respect to the source of the power to govern and regulate.</p>
<p>The American Union is a peculiar incorporation of States and the
people of States into a General Government. Into this Union no
community of people, however previously existing, can be admitted save
in a peculiar form, known in our polity as a “State.” It must have
prepared a republican form of government, adapted to the Constitution
of the United States. When, therefore, Congress has decided that the
people of such a country shall have the privilege of erecting or
forming themselves into a “State,” the power to govern them under the
war or treaty power ceases, for this manifest reason—that the continued
exercise of a power which is arbitrary and despotic in its nature is
inconsistent with the condition of society necessary to the successful
formation of the institutions which are to constitute what we call a
“State.” But before the “State” is formed there must be an interval,
and during that interval the authority of the United States must, in
some form and from some source of power, continue to be exercised. The
form and the source of power here applicable are to be found in the
territorial clause.</p>
<b>[*39]</b>
<p>If I have rightly stated the history and construction of that
clause, it was framed for the purpose of providing a legislative power,
by which Congress can govern a Territory while it is in the process of
being formed into a State, preparatory to its admission into the Union.
There is, undoubtedly, a <i>hiatus</i> in the text of the
Constitution, inasmuch as there are no express words which in terms
establish a connection between the two clauses of the section. But the
history of both the clauses conclusively establishes this connection,
and shows the purpose of the last one. The nature of the authority
which is provided in this territorial clause is clearly distinguishable
from the authority that results as an “inevitable consequence” from the
acquisition by conquest or by treaty. It is a legislative authority; it
must be exercised in the forms of law, by rule, by regulation. The
legislation, moreover, must be such as, in the judgment of Congress, is
“needful;” that is to say, the authority which is to be exercised is
not to be arbitrary, not to be capricious, and not to be exerted by the
will of the Executive under the war power or the treaty power; but it
is to be exercised through the judgment of Congress as the legislative
department, and by such provisions of law as that department shall
determine to be “needful.” Concerning the fitness of such a power, and
the propriety of applying it to the condition of things existing after
it has been decided that a community external to the Union shall be
formed into a “State,” there cannot be two opinions.</p>
<p>I have submitted these views for the purpose of asking the Court to
consider whether they do not reconcile the language used by Chief
Justice Marshall in the <b>[*40]</b> case of <i>The American Insurance Company</i> v. <i>Canter</i>,
and whether they do not show that the alleged uncertainty in his mind
concerning the source of the power of territorial government had in
truth no real existence. But I am trespassing upon time that belongs to
other suitors, and detaining the Court. I connected myself with this
cause solely from an impulse of duty, or what seemed to me a duty, in
the peculiar position in which the counsel for the plaintiff in error
(Mr. Blair) stated himself in his opening to have been placed, by
circumstances which had made it impracticable for him to obtain
assistance in the argument of his case. Having discharged that duty in
a necessarily imperfect manner, I now commit the cause to the Court.</p>

<p><i>Extract from a paper furnished by Mr. Jefferson in answer to
questions addressed to him by one of the authors of the Encyclopedie
Methodique, in</i> 1786 <i>or</i> 1787.</p>
<p>“The 11th Article of Confederation admits Canada to accede to the
Confederation at its own will, but adds, ‘no other colony shall be
admitted to the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine
States.’ When the plan of April, 1784, for establishing new States was
on the carpet, the committee who framed the report of that plan had
inserted this clause: ‘Provided nine States agree to such admission,
according to the reservation of the 11th of the Articles of
Confederation.’ It was objected, 1. That the words of the
Confederation, ‘no other colony,’ could refer only to the residuary
possessions of Great Britain, as the two Floridas, Nova Scotia,
&amp;c., not being already parts of the Union; that the law for
‘admitting’ a new member into the Union, could not be applied to a
Territory which was already in the Union, as making part of a State
which was a member of it. 2. That it would be improper to allow ‘nine’
States to receive a new member, because the same reasons which rendered
that number proper now, would render a greater one proper, when the
number composing the Union should be increased. They therefore <b>[*42]</b>
struck out this paragraph, and inserted a proviso, that ‘the consent of
so many States, in Congress, shall be first obtained, as may, at the
time, be competent;’ thus leaving the question, whether the 11th
Article applies to the admission of new States to be decided when that
admission shall be asked. See the Journal of Congress of April 20,
1781. Another doubt was started in this debate, namely: Whether the
agreement of the nine States, required by the Confederation, was to be
made by their legislatures, or by their delegates in Congress? The
expression adopted, namely: ‘So many States, in Congress, is first
obtained,’ shows what was their sense of this matter. If it be agreed
that the 11th Article of the Confederation is not to be applied to the
admission of these new States, then it is contended that their
admission comes within the 13th Article, which forbids ‘any alteration,
unless agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and afterwards
confirmed by the legislatures of every State.’ The independence of the
new States of Kentucky and Franklin, [Tennessee,] will soon bring on
the ultimate decision of all these questions.“—(Jefferson’s Works, vol.
9, p. 251, 252.)</p>
<p>No date is affixed to the paper from which the above extract is
taken; but it would seem from the final remark respecting Kentucky and
Tennessee, that it must have been written shortly before the calling of
the Convention which framed the Constitution, or before Mr. Jefferson,
who was then in France, had heard that such a Convention was
contemplated.</p>
