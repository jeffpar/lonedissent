<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: Mr. Carter.

<p style="text-align:center">
  <b>OPENING ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. CARTER, ESQ., <br>
  ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS</b></p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: This case is here on direct appeal pursuant to Title 28, section 
1253, 2101(b), from the final judgment of a statutory three-judge court, 
District Court for the District of Kansas, denying appellants&#39; motion, 
application for a permanent injunction to restrain the enforcement of Chapter 
72-1724 of the General Statutes of Kansas, on the grounds of that statute&#39;s 
fatal conflict with the requirements and guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>The statute in question empowers boards of education in cities of the first 
class in Kansas to maintain and operate public elementary schools on a 
segregated basis, with the exception of Kansas City, Kansas, which is empowered 
to maintain segregated public high schools also.</p>
<p>The law of Kansas is clear, as construed by the highest court of that State, 
that except for this statutory authority, the appellees in this instance would 
have no power to make any distinction whatsoever in public schools among 
children on the basis of race and color; or, to put it another way, the law of 
Kansas is this: that it is a violation of state law for any state officer to use 
race as a factor in affording educational opportunities unless that authority is 
specifically, clearly, and expressly granted by the legislature.</p>
<p>The state cases, which are set forth and would set this out, are cited at 
page two of our brief.</p>
<p>Now, it is to be noted that this statute prohibits any type of color 
discrimination in high schools, with the exception of Kansas City, Kansas.</p>
<p>The Topeka school system is operated on a six-three-three plan: elementary 
schools going through the sixth grade, thereafter junior high schools through 
the ninth grade, and thereafter senior high schools.</p>
<p>So that in this instance, appellants are required to attend segregated 
elementary schools through the sixth grade, but thereafter they go to high 
schools without any determination being made as to which school they will attend 
on the basis of race. If appellants are of Negro origin, they are minors who are 
not eligible at the present time to attend the public elementary schools in 
Topeka.</p>
<p>The appellees are empowered by state law to maintain the public school system 
in Topeka, Kansas. The City of Topeka has been divided into eighteen territorial 
divisions for public school purposes. In each of these divisions appellees 
maintain one school for white residents; in addition, they maintain four 
segregated schools for Negroes.</p>
<p>It is the gravamen of our complaint—it was the gravamen of our complaint 
below, and it is the gravamen of our appeal here—that the appellees have 
deprived—we have been deprived of the equal protection of the laws where the 
statute requires appellants to attend public elementary schools on a segregated 
basis, because the act of separation and the act of segregation in and of itself 
denies them equal educational opportunities which the Fourteenth Amendment 
secures.</p>
<p>In the answer below, the appellees, the school board, defended this action on 
the ground that they were acting pursuant to the statute; that appellants were 
not entitled to attend the elementary schools in Kansas, the eighteen elementary 
schools, which they maintained for white children, solely because of race and 
color, and that they wouldn&#39;t be admitted into those schools because they were 
Negroes.</p>
<p>The State of Kansas in the court below, and in its brief filed here, defends 
the constitutionality of the statute in question, and affirmatively asserts that 
the state has the power to authorize the imposition of racial distinction for 
public school purposes.</p>
<p>The only state or federal constitutional limitation which the State of Kansas 
concedes on that power is that when these distinctions are imposed the school 
physical facilities for Negro children must be equal. With that limitation, they 
say that there can be no constitutional limitation on their power to impose 
racial distinctions.</p>
<p>A three-judge court was convened in the court below, pursuant to Title 28 of 
the United States Code, section 2281 and 2284, and there a trial on the merits 
took place.</p>
<p>At the trial, appellants introduced evidence designed to 
conclusively demonstrate that the act of segregation in and of itself made the 
educational opportunities which were provided in the four schools maintained for 
Negroes inferior to those in the eighteen schools which were maintained for 
white children, because of racial segregation imposed which severely handicapped 
Negro children in their pursuit of knowledge, and made it impossible for them to 
secure equal education.</p>
<p>In the course of the development of this uncontroverted testimony, appellants 
showed that they and other Negro children similarly situated were placed at a 
serious disadvantage with respect to their opportunity to develop citizenship 
skills, and that they were denied the opportunity to learn to adjust personally 
and socially in a setting comprising a cross section of the dominant population 
of the city.</p>
<p>It was testified that racial segregation, as practiced in the City of Topeka, 
tended to relegate appellants and their group to an inferior caste; that it 
lowered their level of aspiration; that it instilled feelings of insecurity and 
inferiority with them, and that it retarded their mental and educational 
development; and for these reasons, the testimony said, it was impossible for 
the Negro children who were set off in these four schools to secure, in fact or 
in law, an education which was equal to that available to white children in the 
eighteen elementary schools maintained for them.</p>
<p>On August 3, the district court filed its opinion, its findings of fact and 
its conclusions of law, and a final decree, all of which are set out at page 238 
of the record.</p>
<p>We accept and adopt as our own all of the findings of fact of the court 
below, and I wish specifically to call to the Court&#39;s attention the findings 
which are findings four, five and six, which are set out at page 245, in which 
the court found that there was no material difference between the four schools 
maintained for Negroes and the eighteen schools maintained for white children 
with respect to physical facilities, the educational qualifications of teachers, 
and the courses of study prescribed.</p>
<p>Here we abandon any claim, in pressing our attack on the unconstitutionality 
of this statute—we abandon any claim of any constitutional inequality which 
comes from anything other than the act of segregation itself. In short, the sole 
basis for our appeal here on the constitutionality of the statute of Kansas is 
that it empowers the maintenance and operation of racially segregated schools, 
and under that basis we say, on the basis of the fact that the schools are 
segregated, that Negro children are denied equal protection of the laws, and 
they cannot secure equality in educational opportunity.</p>
<p>This the court found as a fact, and I will go into that finding, which is 
also set out on page 25 of the brief, later in the development of my argument. 
But suffice it to say for this purpose that, although the court found that 
racial segregation created educational inequality in fact, it concluded, as a 
matter of law, that the only type of educational inequality which was cognizable 
under the Constitution was an educational inequality which stems from material 
and physical factors; and absent any inequality of that level, the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We are bound by <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>, and <i>
  Gong Lum v. 
  Rice</i> to hold in appellees&#39; favor and uphold the constitutionality of that 
  statute.</p>
</blockquote>
We have one fundamental contention which we will seek to develop in the course 
of this argument, and that contention is that no state has any authority under 
the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to use race as a factor 
in affording educational opportunities among its citizens.<p>We say that for two 
reasons: First, we say that a division of citizens by the states for public 
school purposes on the basis of race and color effects an unlawful and an 
unconstitutional classification within the meaning of the equal protection 
clause; and, secondly, we say that where public school attendance is determined 
on the basis of race and color, that it is impossible for Negro children to 
secure equal educational opportunities within the meaning of the equal 
protection of the laws.</p>
<p>With regard to the first basis of our attack on the statute, Kansas has 
authorized, under certain conditions, certain boards of education to divide its 
schools at the elementary school level for the purpose of giving them 
educational opportunities.</p>
<p>It is our position that any legislative or governmental classification must 
fall with an even hand on all persons similarly situated. This Court has long 
held that this is the law with respect to a lawful classification, and in order 
to assure that this evenhandedness of the law in terms of classifications 
exists, this Court has set standards which say that where the legislature of a 
state seeks to make a classification among persons, that that classification and 
those distinctions must rest upon some differentiation fairly related to the 
object which the state seeks to regulate.</p>
<p>Now, in this case the Negro children are—and other Negro children similarly 
situated are—put in one category for public school purposes, solely on the basis 
of race and color, and white children are put in another category for the 
purpose of determining what schools they will attend.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE MINTON</b>: Mr. Carter, I do not know whether I 
have followed you or all the facts on this. Was there a finding that the only 
basis of classification was race or color?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: It was admitted—the appellees admitted in their answer—that the 
only reason that they would not permit Negro children to attend the eighteen 
white schools was because they were Negro.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE MINTON</b>: Then we accept on this record that the only showing is 
that the classification here was solely on race and color?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir. I think the state itself concedes this is so in its 
brief.</p>
<p>Now, we say that the only basis for this division is race, and that under the 
decisions of this Court that no state can use race, and race alone, as a basis 
upon which to ground any legislative—any lawful constitutional authority—and 
particularly this Court has indicated in a number of opinions that this is so 
because it is not felt that race is a reasonable basis upon which to ground 
acts; it is not a real differentiation, and it is not relevant and, in fact, 
this Court has indicated that race is arbitrary and an irrational standard, so 
that I would also like to point out, if I may, going to and quoting the statute, 
that the statute itself shows that this is so. I am reading from the quote of 
the statute from page three of our brief. The statute says: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Board of Education . may organize and maintain separate schools for the 
  education of white and colored children, including the high schools in Kansas 
  City, Kansas; no discrimination on account of color shall be made in high 
  schools except as provided herein.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We say that on the face of the statute this is explicit recognition of the fact 
that the authorization which the state gave to cities of the first class, and so 
forth, to make this segregation on the basis of race, carried with it the 
necessary fact that they were permitted to discriminate on the basis of race and 
color, and that the statute recognizes that these two things are interchangeable 
and cannot be separated.</p><p>Now, without further belaboring our classification 
argument, our theory is that if the normal rules of classification, the equal 
protection doctrine of classification, apply to this case—and we say they should 
be applied—that this statute is fatally defective, and that on this ground, and 
this ground alone, the statute should be struck down.</p>
<p>We also contend, as I indicated, a second ground for the unconstitutionality 
of the statute. A second part of the main contention is that this type of 
segregation makes it impossible for Negro children and appellants in this case 
to receive equal educational opportunities; and that in this case the court 
below found this to be so as a fact; and I would turn again to quote on page 245 
of the record, finding No. 8, where the court in its findings said—and I quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a 
  detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it 
  has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually 
  interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group. A sense of 
  inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the 
  sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to restrain the educational and 
  mental development of Negro children and to deprive them of some of the 
  benefits they would receive in a racially integrated school system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as we had indicated before, this finding is amply supported by the 
uncontroverted testimony, and we feel that what the court did in this case in 
approaching this finding was that it made the same approach on a factual basis 
that this Court made in the <i>McLaurin</i> and <i>Sweatt</i> cases.</p>
<p>It is our contention, our view, that when this Court was confronted with the 
question of whether <i>McLaurin</i> and <i>Sweatt</i> were afforded equal 
educational opportunities, that it looked at the restrictions imposed to find 
out whether or not they in any way impaired the quality of education which was 
offered and, upon finding that the quality of education that had been offered 
under the segregated conditions—that this Court held in both instances that 
those racial restrictions could not stand.</p>
<p>The court below, based on this finding, starts its examination in this same 
way. It finds that the restrictions which the appellants complained of place 
them and other Negro children in the class at a disadvantage with respect to the 
quality of education which they would receive, and that as a result of these 
restrictions Negro children are—the development of their minds and the learning 
process is impaired and damaged.</p>
<p>We take the position that where there exists educational inequality, in fact, 
that it necessarily follows that educational inequality in the law is also 
present.</p>
<p>But the court below felt, as I indicated before, that the only 
concern of the Constitution with the question of educational equality was that 
the physical facilities afforded had to be equal; and absent any inequality with 
regard to physical facilities, they say, &quot;We are bound by <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>
Ferguson</i> 
and <i>
Gong Lum v. Rice</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>It is also clear from the court&#39;s opinion that it was in a great deal of 
confusion and doubt and, perhaps, even in torture in reaching these results.</p>
<p>I would again like to quote from the record the court&#39;s opinion, on page 243, 
and the court says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If segregation within a school as in the <i>McLaurin</i> case is a. denial 
  of due process, it is difficult to see why segregation in separate schools 
  would not result in the same denial. Or if the denial of the right to 
  commingle with the majority group in higher institutions of learning as in the <i>
  Sweatt</i> 
  case and gain the educational advantages resulting therefrom is lack of due 
  process, it is difficult to see why such denial would not result in the same 
  lack of due process if practiced in the lower grades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We say that but for the constraint which the court feels was imposed upon it 
by the <i>McLaurin</i> case—</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: We will recess for lunch.</p>
<p>[A short recess was taken.]</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>AFTERNOON SESSION</b></p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: Mr. Carter?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Just before the recess, I was attempting to show that in the 
opinion of the court below, that it was clear from the opinion that the court 
felt that the rule of law applicable in the <i>McLaurin</i> and <i>Sweatt</i> 
cases should apply here, but felt that it was constrained and prevented from 
doing that by virtue of <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson</i> and <i>
Gong Lum v. 
Rice</i>. We believe that the court below was wrong in this conclusion. We think 
that the rules of law applicable to <i>McLaurin</i> and <i>Sweatt</i> do apply, 
and that there are no decisions of this Court which require a contrary result.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Was there any evidence in the record to show the inability, 
the lesser ability, of the child in the segregated schools?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir, there was a great deal of testimony on the impact of 
racial distinctions and segregation on the emotional and mental development of a 
child. Now, this is, in summary, Finding 8 of the court, a summarization of the 
evidence that we introduced on that.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: And the findings go to the ability to learn or merely on 
the emotional reaction?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: The finding says that—</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: I know about the finding, but the evidence?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: The evidence, yes, sir. The evidence went to the fact that in the 
segregated school, because of these emotional impacts that segregation has, that 
it does impair the ability to learn, that you are not able to learn as well as 
you do if you were in a mixed school; and that, further than that, you are 
barred from contact with members of the dominant group and, therefore, your 
total educational content is somewhat lower than it would be ordinarily.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Would those citations be in your brief on page nine?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir. In fact, what we attempted to do was to pick up in 
summary and refer the Court to the record of the various disabilities to which 
our witnesses testified, and we covered the question of the content of 
education. They are all set out on page nine of our brief as citations.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BURTON</b>: It is your position that there is a great deal more to 
the educational process even in the elementary schools than what you read in the 
books?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir, that is precisely the point.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BURTON</b>: And it is on that basis which makes a real difference 
whether it is segregated or not?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir. We say that the question of your physical facilities is 
not enough. The Constitution does not, in terms of protecting, giving equal 
protection of the laws with regard to equal educational opportunities, does not 
stop with the fact that you have equal physical facilities, but it covers the 
whole educational process.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: The findings in this case did not stop with equal 
physical facilities, did they?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: No, sir, the findings did not stop, but went beyond that. But, as 
I indicated, the Court did not feel that it could go in the law beyond physical 
facilities.</p>
<p>Of the two cases which the court below indicates have 
kept it from ruling as a matter of law in this case that educational, equal 
educational, opportunities were not afforded, the first is the <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>
Ferguson</i> 
case. It is our position that <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson</i> is not in point 
here; that it had nothing to do with educational opportunities whatsoever. We 
further take the position that, whatever the court below may have felt about the 
reach of the <i>Plessy</i> case, that this Court in the <i>Sweatt</i> case made 
it absolutely clear that <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson</i> had nothing to do with 
the question of education.</p>
<p>The Court, in its opinion, after discussing the <i>Sipuel</i> 
case, the <i>Fisher</i> case, and the <i>Gaines</i> case, in the <i>Sweatt</i> 
opinion said that these are the only cases in this Court which control the issue 
of racial distinction in state-supported graduate and professional education. We 
think this was a pointed and deliberate omission in <i>Plessy</i>, and that the 
Court is saying that <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson</i> certainly has nothing to 
do with the validity of racial distinctions in graduate and professional 
schools.</p>
<p>By the same logic, we say that, since <i>Plessy</i> had nothing to do with 
the higher level of education, it certainly has nothing to do with equal 
educational opportunities in the elementary grades. For that reason we think 
that
<i>Plessy</i> need not be considered; that it has nothing to do with this case, 
and it is out of the case entirely.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: Well, in regard to the findings, it was found that 
the physical facilities, curricula, courses of study, qualifications and quality 
of teachers, as well as other educational facilities in the two sets of schools 
are comparable?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: And the only item of discrimination, an item of 
discrimination, was transportation by bus for the colored students without that 
facility for the white students.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: That is true. But the court—these are the physical factors that 
the court found; and then the court went on to show how segregation made the 
educational opportunities inferior, and this, we think, is the heart of our 
case.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: That is all that you really have here to base your 
segregation issue upon.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: That is right.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: I mean, of course, you could have the issue as to 
equal facilities on the other, but so far as all the other physical facilities, 
curricula, teachers, and transportation and all that, and so forth, there is a 
finding that they are equal?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir, and we do not controvert that finding.</p>
<p>The other case that the court below cited was the <i>
Gong Lum v. Rice</i>  
case. We do not think that that case is controlling here either. In that case it 
is true that what was involved was racial distinction in the elementary grades.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS</b>: Was that a Chinese student?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: That was the Chinese student. But we think that case is so 
different from our case that it cannot control the decision in this case, 
because there the issue which was raised by petitioner of Chinese origin was 
that she did not at all contest the state&#39;s power to enforce a racial 
classification. She conceded that the state had such power. What petitioner was 
objecting to was the fact that, as a Chinese, a child of Chinese origin, that 
she was required to have contact with Negroes for school purposes which, under 
the segregation laws of Mississippi, white children were protected against. She 
said that if—her contention was that if there were some benefits or harms that 
would flow to white children from being forced to have contacts with Negroes, 
that she had an equal right to benefit or to be free of that harm from such 
contact, and that to require her to be classified among Negroes for school 
purpose was a denial to her of the equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p>Our contention is that in that instance that case cannot control a decision 
when here we are contesting the power of the state to make any classification 
whatsoever, and we think that what the court did below, this Court, in defining 
what was the issue in this case, said that the question was whether an American 
citizen of Chinese origin is denied equal protection and classed among the 
colored races for public school purposes, and furnished equal educational 
opportunities. It said that, were this a new question:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We would think it would need our full consideration, and it would be 
  necessary for full argument, but it is not a new question. It is the same 
  question that we have many times decided to be within the purview of the 
  States, without the intervention of the Federal Constitution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we do not believe that <i>
Gong Lum</i> can be considered as a precedent 
contrary to the position we take here. Certainly it cannot be conceded as such a 
precedent until this Court, when the issue is squarely presented to it, on the 
question of the power of the state, examines the question and makes a 
determination in the state&#39;s favor; and only in that instance do we feel that <i>
Gong Lum</i> can be any authority on this question.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Mr. Carter, while what you say 
may be so, nevertheless, in its opinion the Court in <i>
Gong Lum</i> did rest on 
the fact that this issue had been settled by a large body of adjudications going 
back to what was or might fairly have been called an abolitionist state, the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, going back to the Roberts case.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I want to ask you—and may I say, particularly in a 
case of this sort, a question does not imply an answer; a question merely 
implies an eager desire for information—I want to ask you whether in the light 
of that fact—this was a unanimous opinion of the Court which at the time had on 
its membership Justice Holmes, Justice Brandeis, Justice Stone—and I am picking 
those out not invidiously, but as judges who gave great evidence of being very 
sensitive and alert to questions of so-called civil liberties—and I should like 
to ask you whether you think that decision rested on the concession by the 
petitioner in that case, and the problem of segregation was not involved and, in 
fact, that underlay the whole decision, the whole adjudication—whether you think 
a man like Justice Brandeis would have been foreclosed by the concession of the 
parties?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, Your Honor, in all honesty, I would say that only partially 
would I consider that to be true. I think that what the Court did in <i>
Gong Lum</i>, 
the Court was presented with the issue or the question, and it assumed that 
facilities were equal; and the Court at that time, with regard to this issue 
which was raised, although they conceded the power and did not have to make any 
full examination, it felt after reviewing those other decisions that the only 
question that they would have to consider or settle was the question of equal 
facilities.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Yes. But the Court took as settled by a long course 
of decisions that this question was many times decided, that this power was 
within the constitutional power of the state legislatures, this power of 
segregation.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: The more specific question I would like to put to 
you is this: Do we not have to face the fact that what you are challenging is 
something that was written into the public law and adjudications of courts, 
including this Court, by a large body of decisions and, therefore, the question 
arises whether, and under what circumstances, this Court should now upset so 
long a course of decisions? Don&#39;t we have to face that, instead of chipping away 
and saying, &quot;This was dictum,&quot; and &quot;This was a mild dictum,&quot; and &quot;This was a 
strong dictum,&quot; and is anything to be gained by concealing that central fact, 
that central issue?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, I do not think, Your Honor, that you have to face that 
issue. My view is that, with regard to this particular question this Court 
decided with
<i>Sweatt</i> v. <i>Painter</i>—in <i>Sweatt</i> v. <i>Painter</i> in this 
Court, the only decision here which was decided on the question of &quot;separate but 
equal&quot; was a dictum coming out from <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson</i>, and this 
Court in the <i>Sweatt</i> case, it seems to me very carefully to have decided 
that it did not have to face the question because <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson</i> 
was not involved.</p>
<p>I think in this particular case the only decision of this Court which can be 
said to have decided a question of the validity of racial distinction in 
elementary schools is this case that I am discussing. Now, I think that, in view 
of the concession, in view of the fact that the Court felt this was not a case 
of first impression, although I think it was and is a case of first impression 
in this Court at the time it came here, that this Court did not give the 
arguments at all a full consideration which we think that they require.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: You are quite right in suggesting that this question 
explicitly as to segregation in the primary grades has not been adjudicated by 
this Court. This question is, in that frame, in that explicitness, unembarrassed 
by physical inequalities, and so on, before the Court for the first time.</p>
<p>But a long course of legislation by the states, and a long course of 
utterances by this Court and other courts in dealing with the subject, from the 
point of view of relevance as to whether a thing is or is not within the 
prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment, is from my point of view almost as 
impressive as a single decision, which does not mean that I would be controlled 
in a constitutional case by a direct adjudication; but I do think we have to 
face in this case the fact that we are dealing with a long-established 
historical practice by the states, and the assumption of the exercise of power 
which not only was written on the statute books, but has been confirmed and 
adjudicated by state courts, as well as by expressions of this Court.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I would say on that that I was 
attempting here to take the narrow position with regard to this case, and to 
approach it in a way that I thought the Court approached the decision in <i>
Sweatt</i> and <i>McLaurin</i>. I have no hesitancy in saying to the Court that 
if they do not agree that the decision can be handed down in our favor on this 
basis of this approach, that I have no hesitancy in saying that the issue of 
&quot;separate but equal&quot; should be faced and ought to be faced, and that in 
our view the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine should be overruled. But as I said 
before, as the Court apparently approached <i>Sweatt</i> and <i>McLaurin</i>, it 
did not feel it had to meet that issue, and we do not feel it has to meet it 
here. But if the Court has reached a contrary conclusion in regard to it, then 
we, of course, take the position that the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine should 
be squarely overruled.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: May I trouble you to clarify that? Do I understand 
from what you have just said that you think this Kansas law is bad on the 
record, is bad in the Kansas case, on the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, and 
that even by that test this law must fall?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: No, sir, I think—</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Then why do we not have to face the &quot;separate but 
equal&quot; doctrine?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Because insofar as this Court is concerned, as I have indicated 
before, this Court, with the exception of <i>
Gong Lum</i>, has not at the 
elementary level adopted the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. There is no decision 
in this Court, unless the Court feels that <i>
Gong Lum v. Rice</i> is 
that decision.</p>
<p>As I attempted to indicate before, that was a case of first impression, 
although the Court did not seem to think it was, and that here actually we are 
now being presented—the Court is now being presented—with a case of first 
impression, when it has a full record which you can give full consideration to, 
and that <i>
Gong Lum</i>, which did not squarely raise the issue, ought not to 
be controlling.</p>
<p>All I am saying is that you do not have to overrule &quot;separate but equal&quot; at 
the elementary school level in deciding the Kansas case because you have never 
decided the &quot;separate but equal&quot; applied at the elementary school level.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Are you saying that we can say that &quot;separate but 
equal&quot; is not a doctrine that is relevant at the primary school level? Is that 
what you are saying?</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS</b>: I think you are saying that segregation may be all right 
in streetcars and railroad cars and restaurants, but that is all that we have 
decided.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: That is the only place that you have decided that it is all 
right.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS</b>: And that education is different, education is different 
from that.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS</b>: That is your argument, is it not? Isn&#39;t that your 
argument in this case?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: But how can that be your argument when the whole 
basis of dealing with education thus far has been to find out whether it, the 
&quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, is satisfied?</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS</b>: You are talking about the gist of the cases in this 
Court?</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I am talking about the cases in this Court.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: As I interpret the cases in this Court, Your Honor, as I 
interpret the <i>Sweatt</i> case and the <i>McLaurin</i> case, the question of 
&quot;separate and equal,&quot; as to whether the separate and equal doctrine was 
satisfied, I do not believe that that test was applied there. In <i>McLaurin</i> 
there was no separation.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: But take the <i>Gaines</i> case, take the beginning 
of the &quot;separate but equal,&quot; and unless I completely misconceive the cases I 
have read before I came here and those in which I have participated, the test in 
each one of these cases was whether &quot;separate and equal&quot; is relevant or whether 
it was satisfied, and we have held in some of the cases that it was not 
satisfied, and that in a constitutional case we do not have to go beyond the 
immediate necessities of the record, and we have said as to others that for 
purposes of training in the law you have a mixed situation; you cannot draw that 
line.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, take the <i>Gaines</i> case, Your Honor; the only thing 
that I would say on the <i>Gaines</i> case is that what the Court decided in the <i>
Gaines</i> 
case was that, since there were no facilities available to Negroes, that the 
petitioner Gaines had to be admitted to the white school.</p>
<p>Now, it is true that there is certain language in the <i>Gaines</i> 
case which would appear to give support to <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson</i>, but 
the language in terms of the decision—you have to take the language in regard to 
what the decision stated in the <i>Sipuel</i> case—I think it is the same thing, 
and when we get over to <i>Sweatt</i> and <i>McLaurin</i>, we have a situation 
in which this Court went beyond certain physical facilities and said, &quot;These are 
not as important as these other things that we cannot name,&quot; and it decided then 
to set standards so high that it certainly would seem to me to be impossible for 
a state to validly maintain segregation in law schools. </p>
<p>In the <i>McLaurin</i> case, without any question of 
separation, what the Court did was that you have the same teachers and so forth, 
so there could have been no question of his being set apart, except in the 
classroom, and so forth—there could be no question of the quality of instruction 
not being the same. This Court held that those restrictions were sufficient in 
and of themselves to impair McLaurin&#39;s ability to study and therefore to deprive 
him of the equal protection of the law.</p>
<p>So, in my view, although the <i>Gaines</i> case is a case where you have the 
language, the decisions really do not hinge on that.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: In the <i>Gaines</i> case it offered what they called equal 
facilities, did it not?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: They offered facilities out-of-state, out-of-state facilities.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: But which they said were equal.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: The Court said that they were not equal.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir; this Court said not only were they not equal, but that 
the state had the obligation of furnishing whatever facilities it was going to 
offer within the state.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Well, we did have before us in the <i>Gaines</i> case the 
problem of &quot;separate and equal.&quot; We determined that they were not equal because 
they were out of the state.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, Your Honor, I do not conceive of &quot;separate and equal&quot; as 
being the type of offering that the State of Missouri offered when they 
attempted to give out-of-state aid.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Neither did this Court; but Missouri claimed that they were 
equal.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I am sorry, I do not think you have understood my answer. I do 
not conceive of the out-of-state aid which Missouri offered to petitioner Gaines 
to go to some institution outside of the state as being within the purview of a 
&quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. I think that in terms of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; 
doctrine, that there must be the segregation. The &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, 
I think, concerns itself with segregation within the state and the setting up of 
two institutions, one for Negroes and one for whites. All the state was doing, I 
think, there, was that it knew that it had the obligation of furnishing some 
facilities to Negroes, and so it offered them this out-of-state aid. But I do 
not believe that actually it can be—I mean, my understanding is that this cannot 
be classified as a part of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: No. This Court did not classify it that way. They said it 
is not separate and equal to give education in another state and, therefore, 
&quot;You must admit him to the University of Missouri.&quot;</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: The University of Missouri, yes.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Yes.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: But there is another aspect of my question, namely, 
that we are dealing here with a challenge to the constitutionality of 
legislation which is not just one legislative responsibility, not just an 
episodic piece of legislation in one state. But we are dealing with a body of 
enactments by numerous states, whatever they are—eighteen or twenty—not only the 
South but border states and northern states, and legislation which has a long 
history.</p>
<p>Now, unless you say that this legislation merely represents man&#39;s inhumanity 
to man, what is the root of this legislation? What is it based on? Why was there 
such legislation, and was there any consideration that the states were warranted 
in dealing with—maybe not this way—but was there anything in life to which this 
legislation responds?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, Your Honor, I think that this legislation is clear—certain 
of this legislation in Kansas—that the sole basis for it is race.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Is race?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Is race.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Yes, I understand that. I understand all this 
legislation. But I want to know why this legislation, the sole basis of which is 
race—is there just some willfulness of man in the states or some, as I say, of 
man&#39;s inhumanity to man, some ruthless disregard of the facts of life?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: As I understand the state&#39;s position in Kansas, the State of 
Kansas said that the reason for this legislation to be applicable in urban 
centers, is that although Negroes compose four percent of the population in 
Kansas, ninety percent of them are concentrated in the urban areas, in the 
cities of the first class and that Kansas has people from the North and the 
South with conflicting views about the question of the treatment of Negroes and 
about the separation and segregation, and that, therefore what they did was that 
they authorized, with the power that they had, they authorized these large 
cities where Negroes appeared in large numbers to have segregated public 
elementary schools.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: When did that first appear in 
the Kansas law?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I am not sure, but I believe in 1862.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: In 1862, and the next amendment was 1868?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: 1862, Mr. Wilson tells me. The legislation on which this statute 
arose was first enacted in 1862.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: That was amended in 1868.</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: That is right. But our feeling on the reach of equal protection, 
the equal protection clause, is that as these appellants, as members of a 
minority group—whatever the majority may feel that they can do with their rights 
for whatever purpose, that the equal protection clause was intended to protect 
them against the whims, as they come and go.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: How would you establish the fact that it was 
intended to protect them against them? How would I find out if I liked to follow 
your scent; that is, what the Amendment is intended to accomplish, how would I 
go about finding that out?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I think that this Court in, certainly since <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>
Ferguson</i>—this Court, and in <i>Shelley</i> v. <i>Kraemer</i>, has repeatedly 
said this was the basis for the Amendment. The Amendment was intended to protect 
Negroes in civil and political equality with whites.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Impliedly it prohibited the doctrine of 
classification, I take it?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I would think, Your Honor, that without regard to the question of 
its effect on Negroes, that this business of classification, this Court has 
dealt with it time and time again.</p>
<p>For example, in regard to a question of equal treatment between a foreign 
corporation admitted to the state and a domestic corporation, where the only 
basis for the inequality is the question of the residence of the foreign 
corporation, this Court has held under its classification doctrine that there is 
a denial of equal protection.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Meaning by that that there was no rational basis for 
the classification?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, I think that our position is that there is no rational 
basis for classification based on that.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: But do you think that you can argue that or do you 
think that we can justify this case by some abstract declaration?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, I have attempted before lunch, Your Honor, to address 
myself to that point, and that was one of the bases for our attack; that this 
was a classification, an instance of a classification, based upon race which, 
under these decisions of this Court, does not form a valid basis for the 
legislation.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Mr. Carter, you speak of equal protection. Do you make a 
distinction between equal protection and classification, on the one side, and 
due process on the other? Is that your contention, that this violates due 
process?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: We do not contend it in our complaint. We think that it could, 
but we thought that equal protection was sufficient to protect us.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: And do you find a distinction between equal protection and 
due process in this case?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I do not. I think that the Court would, in terms of equal 
protection and due process, decide that under the equal protection clause and, 
therefore, do not consider due process. But so far as my understanding of the 
law, I would say that there would be no real distinction between the two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to reserve the next few minutes for rebuttal.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: General Wilson.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OF PAUL E. WILSON, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES</b></p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: May it please the Court:</p>
<p>I represent the State of Kansas, who was an intervening defendant in this 
proceeding. The issue raised by the pleadings filed by the State in the court 
below was restricted solely to the matter of the constitutionality of this 
statute, and I want to limit my remarks to that particular phase of the subject.</p>
<p>This Court heretofore noted an apparent reluctance on the part of the State 
of Kansas to appear in this case and participate actively in these proceedings. 
Because of that fact, I would like to digress for a moment and explain to you 
the position that the State takes with regard to this litigation.</p>
<p>As my adversary pointed out, the effect of the Kansas statute is local only; 
it is not statewide. Furthermore, the statute permits, and does not require, 
boards of education in designated cities to maintain segregated school systems. 
Pursuant to that statute, the Board of Education of the City of Topeka set up 
and does operate a segregated school system affecting students in the elementary 
grades.</p>
<p>Now, this lawsuit in the court below was directed at the 
Topeka Board of Education. The school system set up and maintained by that board 
was under attack. The Attorney General, therefore, took the position that this 
action was local in nature and not of statewide concern. We did not participate 
actively in the trial of the case.</p>
<p>However, after the trial in the court below there was a change in personnel 
and a change in attitude on the part of the Board of Education. The Board of 
Education determined then that it would not resist this appeal. The Attorney 
General thereupon determined that he should be governed, his attitude should be 
governed, by the attitude taken on the local level. Consequently we did not 
appear.</p>
<p>I mention this to emphasize the fact that we have never at any time 
entertained any doubt about the constitutionality of our statute.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: General Wilson, may I state to you that we were 
informed that the Board of Education would not be represented here in argument 
and would not file a brief, and it being a very important question, and this 
case having facets that other cases did not, we wanted to hear from the State of 
Kansas.</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: We are very glad to comply with the Court&#39;s request. I was simply 
attempting to emphasize that we did not intentionally disregard our duty to this 
Court.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: I understand it.</p>
<p>As I understand it, you had turned it over to the Board of Education and 
expected them to appear here, is that right?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: That is correct, sir.</p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON</b>: And when we found out that they were not going to, 
we did not want the State of Kansas and its viewpoint to be silent.</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Now, the views of the State of Kansas can be stated very simply 
and very briefly: We believe that our statute is constitutional. We do not 
believe it violates the Fourteenth Amendment. We believe so because our supreme 
court, the Supreme Court of Kansas, has specifically said so. We believe that 
the decisions of the Supreme Court of Kansas follow and are supported by the 
decisions of this Court, and the decisions of many, many appellate courts in 
other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In order to complete the perspective of the Court with respect to the Kansas 
school system, I should like to allude briefly to the general statutes of Kansas 
which provide for elementary school education. There are three types of 
municipal corporations in Kansas authorized to maintain public elementary 
schools. There is the city of the first class, cities consisting of 15,000 or 
more persons, of which there are twelve in the state; then there are cities of 
the second class, and cities of the third class, which are included within the 
common school districts.</p>
<p>Now, this statute, I want to emphasize, applies only to cities of the first 
class, to those cities which have populations of more than 15,000. It does 
authorize separate schools to be maintained for the Negro and white races in the 
elementary grades in those cities, with the exception of Kansas City, where a 
separate junior high school and high school is authorized.</p>
<p>My adversary has conceded, and the court below has found, that there was no 
substantial inequality in the educational facilities afforded by the City of 
Topeka to these appellants. The physical facilities were found to be the same, 
or substantially alike.</p>
<p>Not only was that finding made with regard to physical facilities, but the 
course of study was found to be that subscribed by state law and followed in 
both systems of schools. The instructional facilities were determined to be 
substantially equal. There was the item of distinction wherein transportation 
was supplied to the Negro students and not to the white students. That certainly 
was not an item which constituted one of discrimination against the Negro 
students.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is our theory that this case resolves itself simply to this: 
whether the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine is still the law, and whether it is to 
be followed in this case by this Court.</p>
<p>My adversary has mentioned—again I want to emphasize that the Negro 
population in Kansas is slight. Less than four percent of the total population 
belong to the Negro race.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: What is that number?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Sir?</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: What is that number?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: The population of the State, the total population, is 
approximately two million. The total Negro population is approximately 73,000.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: And of those, how many are in the cities of 15,000, 
about nine-tenths, would you say?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Our brief says that nine-tenths of the Negro population lived in 
cities classified as urban. The urban classification includes those of 2,500 or 
more. I should say that two-thirds of the Negro population lived in cities of 
the first class.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: And this, according to your 
brief, as I remember—the present situation in Kansas is that this segregated 
class of primary schools are in only nine of those cities?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: In only nine of our cities.</p>
<p>As I recall, there are eighteen separate elementary schools maintained in the 
State under and by virtue of the statute. There is one separate junior high 
school and one separate high school. In other communities we do have voluntary 
segregation, but that does not exist with the sanction or the force of law.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Do you have any Indians in Kansas?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: We have a few, Your Honor.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Where do they go to school?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: I know of no instances where Indians live in cities of the first 
class. Most of our Indians live on the reservation. The Indians who do live in 
cities of the first class would attend the schools maintained for the white 
race.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Those who live on the reservations go to Indian schools?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Yes, sir; attend schools maintained by the Government.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Do any people go to them besides the Indians?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: I do not believe so, sir.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: May I trouble you before you conclude your argument 
to deal with this aspect of the case, in the light of the incident of the 
problems in Kansas, namely, what would be the consequences, as you see them, for 
this Court to reverse this decree relating to the Kansas law; or, to put it 
another way, suppose this Court reversed the case, and the case went back to the 
district court for the entry of a proper decree. What would Kansas be urging 
should be the nature of that decree in order to carry out the direction of this 
Court?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: As I understand your question, you are asking me what practical 
difficulties would be encountered in the administration of the school system?</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Suppose there would be some difficulties. I want to 
know what the consequences of the reversal of the decree would be, and what 
Kansas would be urging us the most for dealing with those consequences in the 
decree?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: In perfect candor, I must say to the Court that the consequences 
would probably not be serious. As I pointed out, our Negro population is small. 
We do have in our Negro schools Negro teachers, Negro administrators, that would 
necessarily be assimilated in the school system at large. That might produce 
some administrative difficulties. I can imagine no serious difficulty beyond 
that.</p>
<p>Now, the question of the segregation of the Negro race in our schools has 
frequently been before the Supreme Court of Kansas, and at the outset I should 
say that our court has consistently held that segregation can be practiced only 
where authorized by the statutes. The rationale of all those cases is simply 
this: The municipal corporation maintaining the school district is a creature of 
statute. It can do only what the statute authorizes. Therefore, unless there is 
a specific power conferred, the municipal corporation maintaining the school 
district cannot classify students on the basis of color.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Have there been efforts made to remove the act permitting 
segregation or authorizing segregation in Kansas?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: I recall—I think I mentioned in my brief—in 1876 in a general 
codification of the school laws, the provision authorizing the maintenance of 
separate schools was, apparently through inadvertence, omitted by the 
legislature. It was nevertheless deemed to be repealed by implication. But 
thereafter, in 1879, substantially the same statute was again enacted. Since 
that time, to my knowledge, there have been no considered efforts made in the 
legislature to repeal that statute.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Mr. Attorney General, you emphasized the four percent 
and the smallness of the population. Would that affect your problem if there 
were heavier concentrations?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: It is most difficult for me to answer that question. It might. I 
am not acquainted with the situation where there is a heavier concentration, in 
other words.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: I mean, your statute adapts itself to different 
localities. What are the variables that the statute was designed to take care 
of, if any, if you know, at this late date?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: My theory of the justification of the statute is this: The State 
of Kansas was born out of the struggle between the North and the South prior to 
the War Between the States, and our State was populated by squatters from the 
North and from the South.</p>
<p>Those squatters settled in communities. The pro-slavery 
elements settled in Leavenworth, in Atchison, and Lecompton. The Free Soil 
elements settled in Topeka, in Lawrence, and in Wyandotte. The Negroes who came 
to the State during and immediately subsequent to the war also settled in 
communities.</p>
<p>Consequently, our early legislatures were faced with this situation: In some 
communities the attitudes of the people were such that it was deemed best that 
the Negro race live apart. In other communities a different attitude was 
reflected. Also in some communities there was a substantial Negro population. In 
other communities there were few Negroes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature sought by this type of legislation to provide a 
means whereby the community could adjust its plan to suit local conditions, and 
we believe they succeeded.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: You mentioned Topeka as one of the Free State 
settlements, and that seems to be the subject that is involved here with the 
segregation ordinances. Is there any explanation for that?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: As I explained these matters—I am speculating—we have in Kansas—</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Your speculation ought to be worth more than mine.</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: We have in Kansas history a period of migration of the Negro race 
to Kansas which we call the exodus, the black exodus, as spoken of in the 
history books. At that time, which was in the &#39;eighties, large numbers of Negro 
people came from the South and settled in Kansas communities. A large number of 
those people settled in Topeka and, for the first time, I presume—and again I am 
speculating—there was created there the problem of the racial adjustment within 
the community.</p>
<p>The record in this case infers that segregation was established in Topeka 
about fifty years ago. I am assuming that, in my speculation for the Court, that 
segregation began to be practiced in Topeka after the exodus had given Topeka a 
substantial colored population.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: You spoke of the density of the Negro population, of about 
four percent covering the State as a whole. Have you in mind what city has the 
largest concentration of residents by percentage?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: The city with the largest concentration of Negro population is 
Kansas City, Kansas.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: That is by percentage?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: By percentage, as well as in absolute numbers.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: How high is it there?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: The Negro population, I should say—perhaps Mr. Scott can help me 
with this—I should say not more than ten per cent; is that correct?</p>
<p><b>MR. SCOTT</b>: That is about right, yes.</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: This statute has been squarely challenged in our: Kansas Supreme 
Court and has been upheld, and I cite in my case the leading case of <i>Reynolds</i> 
v. <i>The School Board</i>, where in 1903 the court held flatly that the Kansas 
statute does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States That opinion is an exhaustive one wherein the court drew on the 
Roberts case in Massachusetts and numerous other cases cited in the appellate 
courts of the State, and the court followed specific ally the rule laid down in 
the <i>Plessy</i> case.</p>
<p>It is our position that the principle announced in the <i>
Plessy</i>, case and the specific rule announced in the <i>
Gong Lum</i> case an 
absolutely controlling here. We think it is sheer sophistry to at tempt to 
distinguish those cases from the case that is here present ed, and we think the 
question before this Court is simply: Is the <i>Plessy</i> case and the <i>
Gong 
Lum</i> case and the &quot;separate but equal&#39; doctrine still the law of this land?</p>
<p>We think if you decide in favor of these appellants, the Court will 
necessarily overrule the doctrines expressed in those case and, at the same 
time, will say that the legislatures of the seven teen or twenty-one states, 
that the Congress of the United States that dozens of appellate courts have been 
wrong for a period o: more than seventy-five years, when they have believed and 
have manifested a belief that facilities equal though separate were with in the 
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: There is a third one—</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BURTON</b>: Don&#39;t you recognize it as possible that within 
seventy-five years the social and economic conditions an( the personal relations 
of the nation may have changed, so that what may have been a valid 
interpretation of them seventy-five years ago would not be a valid 
interpretation of them constitutionally today?</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: We recognize that as a possibility. We do not believe that this 
record discloses any such change.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BURTON</b>: But that might be a difference between saying that these 
courts of appeals and state supreme courts have been wrong for seventy-five 
years.</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>We concede that this Court can overrule the <i>
Gong Lum</i> 
doctrine, the <i>Plessy</i> doctrine, but nevertheless, until those cases are 
overruled they are the best guide we have.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: As I understood my brother Burton&#39;s question or as I 
got the implication of his question, it was not that the Court would have to 
overrule those cases; the Court would simply have to recognize that laws are 
kinetic, and some new things have happened, not deeming those decisions wrong, 
but bringing into play new situations toward a new decision. I do not know 
whether he would disown me, but that is what I got out of it.</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: We agree with that proposition. But I repeat, we do not think 
that there is anything in the record here that would justify such a conclusion.</p>
<p>Now, something has been said about Finding of Fact No. 8 in the district 
court, and I would like to comment briefly upon that finding of fact. The Court 
will recall that that is the finding of fact wherein the lower court determined 
generally that segregation of white and colored children in the public schools 
has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. It may be significant that 
this finding of fact was based upon the uncontroverted testimony of witnesses 
produced by the appellants in this case. I should also like to point out that 
that finding of fact was based upon the uncontested evidence presented by the 
case.</p>
<p>We think it is obvious, however, that the district court regarded Finding of 
Fact No. 8 as being legally insignificant, because, having made a finding of 
fact, Finding of Fact No. 8, where-in the general statement is made that Negro 
children might be benefited by attendance at an integrated school system, the 
district court concluded in its conclusion of law simply this: The court has 
heretofore filed its findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with an 
opinion, and has held that, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs have failed to 
prove that they were entitled to the relief demanded. In other words, Finding of 
Fact No. 8 is immaterial, we believe, so far as the issues of this case are 
concerned.</p>
<p>The court did find—and we have mentioned the finding specifically—that 
physical facilities were equal; the court found that instructional facilities 
were equal; the court found that courses of study were equal. Those are the 
items that the State and the school districts have within their power to confer.</p>
<p>This additional item, the psychological reaction, is something which is 
something apart from the objective components of the school system, and 
something that the State does not have within its power to confer upon the 
pupils therein. Therefore, the district court—and we believe rightly—regarded it 
as something that is inconsequential, immaterial, not governing in this case.</p>
<p>We make one further point in our brief that may be significant, and that is 
that Finding of Fact No. 8 is a general finding. It does not relate to these 
specific appellants.</p>
<p>As we understand the law, in order to obtain an injunction, obtain injunctive 
relief, which is prayed for here, it is necessary that these appellants show in 
the court below, first, that they have actually suffered personal harm from 
attending segregated schools in Topeka, Kansas; they must show that either they 
have been deprived of some benefit that is conferred on the rest of the 
population or they must show that they are being subjected to some detriment 
that the rest of the population does not suffer.</p>
<p>Now, we must submit that there is nothing in the Finding of Fact No. 8 which 
indicates that these appellants specifically have suffered any harm by reason of 
being compelled to attend a segregated school system in the City of Topeka.</p>
<p>I think it is significant that all of the other findings of fact relate 
specifically to the Topeka school system. They use the definite article when 
describing &quot;the&quot; system, until Finding of Fact No. 8, and there the general 
statement is made indicating that the court believes that Negro children 
generally would be better off if they were attending an integrated school 
system.</p>
<p>Now, we submit on the basis of that finding of fact the plaintiffs below and 
the appellants here have not shown their right to injunctive relief because they 
have not shown the injury that the decisions of this Court seem to require.</p>
<p>The position of the State of Kansas, to emphasize again, is simply this: Our 
statute is constitutional; it does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, and 
that position is supported by all of the decisions of the Kansas courts. That 
position, we think, is supported by the decisions of this Court.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. CARTER, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS</b></p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: We think that finding of fact of the court below makes necessary 
a reversal of its judgment. Without regard to any other consideration, the court 
below found that inequality flowed from segregation, and our position, as stated 
previously, is, ii there are facilities, educational opportunities, in fact, 
that educational opportunities cannot be equal in law.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Why do you think that would apply?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Because of the fact, sir—</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Suppose it had been found differently?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: If it had been found, or I should say, if the Court agrees that 
the findings are correct—</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Suppose another court finds strictly to the contrary with 
reference to the general principle; what would you say?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, this Court, of course, in a question like that reexamines 
the findings or the basis for the findings and can reach its own conclusion in 
that regard.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Do you think the Court can make a finding independent of 
the basis of fact?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: No, sir, they do not. What I meant to say was that this Court, if 
they agreed with the findings on an examination of this record, agreed with the 
findings of fact of the court below, and came to the conclusion that the court 
below had correctly found the facts on its own independent examination, that 
this Court would—it would necessitate a reversal of that court&#39;s judgment. I do 
not mean that the findings of the court below come here and that you have to 
accept them. Of course, I do not agree with that.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Do you think that there should be a different holding here 
with reference to the question involved, according to the place where the 
segregation might occur, and if not, why do you say it depends—why do you say 
that it depends on the findings of fact at all?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I say that about the findings of fact because what I think the 
court below did was, in approaching this question, it followed the example of 
this Court in <i>McLaurin</i> and <i>Sweatt</i> and, I think, it approached the 
question correctly; so that it found that inequality in educational opportunity 
existed as a result of the racial restrictions.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Is that a general finding or do you state that for the 
State of Kansas, City of Topeka?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I think I agree with the fact that the finding refers to the 
State of Kansas and to these appellants and to Topeka, Kansas. I think that the 
findings were made in this specific case referring to this specific case.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: In other words, if you are going to go on the findings, 
then you would have different rulings with respect to the places to which this 
applies; is that true?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, the only thing that I think the findings do when this Court 
reached the question and held this finding, it seems to me that the only thing 
that the findings would do is that—without regard to the question, the court 
below, examining the facilities, found that they were unequal.</p>
<p>Now, of course, under our theory you do not have to reach the finding of fact 
or a fact at all in reaching the decision because of the fact that we maintain 
that this is an unconstitutional classification being based upon race and, 
therefore, it is arbitrary. But all I was attempting to address myself to was to 
the specific examination by the court below on the impact of segregation on the 
equality of educational opportunities afforded.</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Are you planning to attach relevance to anything except 
the question of whether they are separate but equal?</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I think that they are relevant to the question of whether there 
are equal educational opportunities that are being afforded. I think whether, in 
fact, you have equal education in the opinion of the court below, that the 
findings are relevant, and I think that the court below found that the 
educational facilities were unequal as a result of segregation; but it felt that 
it could not reach the legal conclusion that they were unequal because of two 
decisions we have discussed.</p>
<p>Now, to conclude, our feeling is that this case could be decided on the 
question of the illegality of the classification itself. This case also could be 
decided on the question of equal educational opportunities as they are examined 
by the approach of <i>McLaurin</i> and <i>Sweatt</i>.</p>
<p>We think that the court below did the same thing. The court below did what 
this Court did in <i>McLaurin</i> and in <i>Sweatt</i>, and we think that in the 
examination of the equality of education offered, that what it did was, it found 
that these restrictions imposed disabilities on Negro children and prevented 
them from having educational opportunities equal to white, and for these reasons 
we think that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the Kansas 
statute should be struck down.</p>
<p>[Whereupon, at 3:15 o&#39;clock p.m., the argument was concluded.] </p>

<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: No. 1, <i>Oliver Brown, Mrs. Richard Lawton, Mrs. Sadie

<p><b>THE CLERK</b>: Counsel are present, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Mr. Carter? </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>OPENING ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. CARTER, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Mr. Chief Justice: </p>
<p>The facts in this case are similar to those involved in the cases preceding. 
The appellants are of elementary school age, of Negro origin, and they are required 
to obtain their elementary school education in segregated elementary schools maintained 
pursuant to the laws of the State of Kansas, and pursuant to the rules and regulations 
of the Topeka School Board. </p>
<p>The statute in question, whose constitutionality we are here attacking, is chapter 
172 of the Kansas Statutes of 1949. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Is your case moot, Mr. Carter? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I hoped that I would get a little further into the argument before 
that question was asked. </p>
<p>[Laughter.] </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: We take the position, Your Honor, that the case is not moot. The 
government—the State, that is—takes the same position. We take that position because 
of the fact that, although the plan which I had hoped to get to when I discussed 
questions four and five—but if you want me to discuss it now, I will—the plan which 
is presently in operation, and the resolution of the School Board of Topeka under 
which they have decided that they will eliminate segregation in the elementary schools 
in Topeka—under this plan, two schools have been desegregated, and the Negro children 
have been admitted. However, with respect to the remaining schools, Negro children 
are still segregated. </p>
<p>The brief which the Topeka Board filed with this Court gives no indication as 
to how long they feel the plan which they now have in operation will take before the other Negro children will be able to go 
to an integrated school system. We feel further that the case is not moot because 
the statute is still involved, and if the Court were without these problems being 
settled, we still have—while we have only one appellant here who has been admitted 
to the school, unsegregated school, pursuant to this plan—our position is that the 
case is not a moot case, and we have to address ourselves to the questions which 
the Court asked. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Is Topeka here apart from—I understand the State 
takes a different view. Is the immediate respondent—appellee here? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: If Your Honor will remember, last year the Topeka School Board did 
not appear. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: No. </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: This year they did not appear. So far as I know, they have no 
intention of appearing, if I am right in that—Mr. Wilson? </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: They have every intention of giving you what you want, 
is that it? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I beg your pardon? </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: They merely have the intention of giving you what you 
want, and not contesting your claim? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is what I call a moot case. </p>
<p>[Laughter.] </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Do I understand that the parties you represent here are 
now admitted to unsegregated schools? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: No, sir. One of the appellants has been admitted to a school in the 
district in which he lives; that school has been opened to Negroes. Just one of 
the appellants has been admitted. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: What about the others? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: The others are still attending the four segregated schools. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: You have clients, then, who are still subject to the rule of segregation? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: But by the authorized pronouncement of the appellee, they will be admitted just as soon as it is physically or administratively 
or whatever the adverbs are—Topeka is able to admit them, and they do not contest 
your position. </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: That is true. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Kansas does contest? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is a different story. But Kansas is not a party.
</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, Kansas appeared in the court below as a party. It intervened 
in the court below as a party, specifically for the purpose of defending the constitutionality 
of the statute. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Yes. But abstractly to defend a statute does not give 
this Court jurisdiction to pass upon it. </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, frankly, Your Honor, my only feeling on this is that, with 
respect to the plan which is in operation, the appellees have certainly 
indicated an intention— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: And you do not question the good faith? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I certainly do not. </p>
<p>But the point that I think that we need to, that we have to have in mind, one, 
I think, insofar as the plan itself is concerned, I have serious questions about—with 
respect to the plan, as to whether this is the forum to raise that, I do not 
know. Also, I think, insofar as the other appellants are concerned, as I 
indicated, I do not know when they will be free from the imprint of the 
statutes, and it does not seem to me that at this point in the litigation I can 
say that the case is moot, when the State of Kansas— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Perhaps I ought to change my inquiry. I do not mean 
to shut off your argument. Having heard you before, it gives me pleasure to hear 
you again. But as I understand it, then, the position is that the respondent, the appellee, meets your claim, and you do not question the purpose is to meet it; and 
the question is whether, as a matter of formality, in fact the concession of your 
claim would be appropriately carried out. </p>
<p>So I suggest what you ought to say to us is that we ought to enter a decree sending 
the case back to the district court to enforce that which the respondent or the 
appellee concedes. Therefore, it is a question of the terms of the decree, is it 
not, in your case? </p>
<p>I am sure that you must feel it is a welcome thing if a board of education accedes 
to your wishes and of its own volition stops—it has a desire not to oppose desegregation, 
and I am sure that is a welcome thing to you. I am not talking about the general 
question; I am talking about the specific thing, that the Board of Education has 
taken the position, and you just want to be sure that they will carry it out; is 
that right? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: That is right. If that is the general view of the Court, I would 
certainly— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: What about the State? As I recall it, the State was admitted 
as a party. </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Yes, sir; the State was admitted as a party. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Or 
merely as a friend of the court. </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: No, they intervened as a party in the court below, defending the 
constitutionality of the statute under which the segregation was practiced and permitted 
and was in fact practiced in Topeka. </p>
<p>In the original— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: And is there authority in the State of Kansas for the Attorney 
General as intervenor in the litigation in which part of the State is involved, 
or a city in the State, or the Board of Education? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: No. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Has that been pointed out as to the Attorney General&#39;s right 
to intervene in the case and take charge of the case? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, that wasn&#39;t what occurred. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: They did not approach it on that basis? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: No, sir. I will explain briefly what happened. We went before a 
statutory court, and we attacked the constitutionality of the statute. The clerk 
of the court advised the Attorney General that a state statute was under attack. 
The Topeka Board appeared and defended their action and the statute, and the 
State appeared separately in order to defend the constitutionality of the 
statute. They are in that position here. They appeared in the original argument, 
and they reappeared— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: They did not appear; we had to bring them in. We had 
to ask them whether they would let the thing go by default. They did not appear; 
they were not so anxious. They did not claim that they had a great right, that they 
had a right to defend here. </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Well, I think— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Perhaps &quot;cajoled&quot; is a better word.
</p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: If you are expressing—if that is the view of the Court, Your 
Honor—
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Mr. Carter, nobody knows better than you that I can 
speak only for one poor lone voice. </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I certainly have no real desire to proceed with an argument. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: But Mr. Carter, if all the appellants had been admitted—suppose 
all of them were in the position of this one child— </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I would have no question about it. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Then the State would not say, &quot;We want to be heard,&quot; 
could they? </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: No, sir. I would have no question about it if all the appellants 
had been admitted; I think that the question of mootness would have been clear. 
But my problem with respect to it is that some are admitted and some are not.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I understand it then, that it is a question of 
whether Topeka will carry this out as. quickly with these other children as they 
have with Leah— </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: Leah Carter. And I also have no way of knowing whether this would 
be so, because the appellees do not appear before the Court, and the State cannot 
speak for the appellees with respect to this question. But if it is permissible, 
I would yield my time to the State, and see what the State has to say about this, 
and I would answer it, if that is permissible so far as the Court is concerned.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: You have the privilege of rebuttal under our rules, if he 
says anything that you wish to answer. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Mr. Wilson, will you please address yourself to the 
question of whether it is moot or not? </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OF PAUL E. WILSON, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF KANSAS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: If it please the Court, it is our position that the case is not moot 
from our standpoint for several reasons. In the first place, the appellant has pointed 
out that only one of the group of appellants that counsel represents has been admitted 
to the integrated public schools of Topeka. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Why is that? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: The Board of Education—may I preface this remark by pointing out 
that our statute is a permissive one. The local boards of education are 
authorized to make the determination on the local level as to whether separate 
or integrated school systems shall be maintained in cities of the first class. 
Now, as a matter 
of policy, and as a matter of policy only, and without reference to this case, the 
Topeka Board of Education has determined that segregation will be abandoned in the 
elementary schools of Topeka as soon as practicable. That is the language of their 
resolution. </p>
<p>Now, we think, if they are simply exercising their prerogative under the statute, 
another city in the State of Kansas, the City of Atchison, has adopted a similar 
resolution that does not reflect at all on this case. </p>
<p>It was our view that the constitutionality of this statute is still under attack. 
We were permitted to defend the constitutionality of the statute in the district 
court. We were asked to defend it in the Supreme Court a year ago. But we feel that 
we must, in order to maintain a position consistent with the expressed intent of 
this Court, answer the brief and the arguments that the appellants have supplied 
us. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: May I trouble you to tell me what are the cities of 
the first class in Kansas? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Yes, sir. May I refer you to Appendix D in our brief, the very last 
page. There are set out in tabular form the nine cities of the first class where 
segregation is maintained on a complete or partial basis in the elementary schools. 
Now, in addition to that, there are three cities, namely Wichita, Hutchinson and 
Pittsburgh, that do not maintain segregated elementary schools. Two of those cities, 
as we point out in our brief, have completed a process of integration during the 
past two years. </p>
<p>We feel that— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Is there any litigation pending as to any of the other 
cities? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: No, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Why did one of the parties, appellants, disappear from the 
case? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: The plan adopted by the Topeka Board of Education was this: You will 
recall from the record last year and the arguments that the city then maintained 
within the entire district eighteen geographic areas. In each geographic area there 
was a school attended by the white students living within the 
limits of that area. In addition to the eighteen white schools, there were four 
Negro schools spaced at wider intervals throughout the city. </p>
<p>The first affirmative step taken by the Board of Education in carrying out its 
policy to abandon segregation as soon as practicable eliminated segregation in two 
of the geographic areas, namely, Randolph and Southwest. There were nine Negro students 
living within the limits of those geographic areas. Consequently, they are admitted 
to the integrated schools, and one of these appellants is one of those children.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: As I understand it, the present situation is that the 
only litigation that is rife is the one now before the Court? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: That is correct, if the Court please. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: As to which the educational authorities, with an authority 
not challenged by the State to stop segregated schools, in fact formally and officially 
announced that they are going to integrate their schools, and have begun the process 
of integration; is that correct? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: I should point out that not only is the authority not challenged 
by the State, the authority is specifically granted by the statute that is here 
being attacked. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: So they are doing what they can do, no matter— </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: They are doing, as a matter of policy, as a matter of legislative 
policy, may I say, what they can do without reference to this case. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: But if they did what it wanted, the State cannot say, 
&quot;You are exceeding your authority,&quot; and no case could come here on that ground, 
could it? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Certainly not. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: If they were to reverse their position tomorrow, these children 
who seek admission would have no right to go unless it was unconstitutional? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Do you think it is an alarming assumption that in 1953, 
where a state has stopped segregation, and in the next year is going to begin segregation 
in Topeka, Kansas? Do you think we ought to do business on that assumption? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: If the Court please, may I distinguish between the State of Kansas and the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, which is a separate 
municipal corporation. The Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, has announced its 
intention to abandon the policy of segregation. I think the Board is acting in complete 
good faith, and I have no notion that they will reverse that trend. On the other 
hand, the State of Kansas is here to defend its statute, and I emphasize, and the 
Court emphasized, we came a year ago, at the express invitation of the Court, and 
there are other cities that are concerned; and, therefore, the State had hoped to 
be heard with respect to the questions that the Court submitted to it on June 8. </p>
<p>If the case is moot, obviously, after five or six hours, argument does reach 
a point of diminishing returns, and certainly we do not want to discuss a matter 
that is moot, if the Court deems that to be the case. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Is there anything that would distinguish your case and that 
would save your statute if the statute in the other states went down? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: I think not, Your Honor. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: So that your case is governed by what—is there anything 
that you have to add that Mr. Davis or Judge Moore have not covered, in defense 
of your statute? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: In preparing my argument, I examined the same authorities that both 
the other appellees and the appellants have examined. As a matter of fact, I cite 
both the same authorities that both the parties, as well as the Attorney General, 
have examined. My conclusions, my interpretations, are substantially those that 
Mr. Davis and Judge Moore have presented to this Court. </p>
<p><b>MR. MOORE</b>: That is Mr. Moore; I would just like to correct that. </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: I am not sure whether it is proper to apologize under the circumstances 
or not. </p>
<p>[Laughter.] </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: You may proceed, Mr. Wilson. </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: In view of the comments by the Court, I shall proceed somewhat summarily. 
I shall not make an effort to review in detail the evidence that I base the conclusions 
that I shall present to the Court. I think the facts—Mr. Carter started to state 
the facts in this case. Perhaps, in order to give proper perspective to my argument, 
some further statement would be proper. </p>
<p>We pointed out that the Board of Education in Topeka is 
a separate municipal corporation, is the party defendant in the court below; that 
the State of Kansas, with the consent of the court below, intervened for the sole 
and only purpose of defending the statute that is under attack. </p>
<p>We further pointed out the permissive nature of our statute. It applies to cities 
of only—only cities of the first class; that is, cities of more than 15,000 population, 
of which there are twelve in the State of Kansas. It applies only on the elementary 
school level. The school systems in the cities that are included in this group are 
divided generally into elementary, junior high, and senior high school levels. The 
elementary category includes only the kindergarten and the first six grades of instruction, 
and it is there only that the statute under attack applies, except in the single 
case of Kansas City where, under an exception in the law, the practice of segregation 
is authorized in the high school, in addition to the elementary grades. </p>
<p>Now, I emphasize that it is our position that the action of the Topeka Board 
of Education, which had been discussed here at some length, does not in any way 
alter the position or the status of the State of Kansas. We are here as appellees; 
we are defending the constitutionality of the statute that is under attack. The 
Board of Education of the City of Topeka, as a matter of policy and not—there is 
nothing in the record to indicate that it is a concession to the appellants in this 
case, but as a matter of policy—and exercising their power under the statute, the 
Board of Education has determined to abandon segregation as early as practicable.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Do you think this is a case of a controversy between these 
people and the City of Topeka? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Sir? </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: Do you think this is a case of a controversy between these 
people and the City of Topeka in the present situation? If so, what is it? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: The appellants have denied the right of the Board of Education of 
the City of Topeka to maintain separate schools, pursuant to our statute. The City 
of Topeka has never agreed that it does not have such a right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: It has been agreed to desegregate schools. </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: It has agreed as a matter of policy to put them in the schools. Now, 
there may be a controversy as to the means of accomplishing this stated intention. 
The Board of Education has filed a separate brief here in which they point out numerous 
administrative difficulties that will be encountered, and in brief, they are 
asking for time, but they do not believe— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE BLACK</b>: You could not rest on that, could you? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: I think 
we could not. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: To follow up Justice Black&#39;s question, is there any 
controversy between these appellants and the State of Kansas, any justiciable controversy?
</p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: These appellants alleged and contend that a statute enacted by the 
legislature of Kansas is unconstitutional. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Suppose I allege that a statute, an Act of Congress, 
is unconstitutional; and I have no secular damage of mine that is effected. I think 
such a profound Act of Congress, passed in this heedless way we have been told about, 
is unconstitutional. Can I go to court? </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: No, obviously not. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Obviously not. </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: However, when you consider the peculiar circumstances under which 
the State of Kansas got into this case— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Litigants sometimes get in, and then find themselves 
out. </p>
<p>[Laughter] </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Unless the Court desires, I do not wish to proceed with argument; 
that is, I have no intention to burden the already overburdened Court. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is not my question. There is no suggestion about 
your not arguing the appropriateness; it is just the question of whether it is one 
of those cases where you have to say there is no controversy in a judicial sense 
before the Court. </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Well, to repeat my earlier statement, I think there still is a controversy, 
because under the authority that the Board of Education presumes to exercise, it 
does maintain segregation in sixteen of its eighteen geographic areas, and it requires 
the children living in those areas to go to segregated schools. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: I consider that a problem; I would like to hear some 
light on it, anyway. I think when both parties to the action feel that there is 
a controversy, and invited the Attorney General to be here and answer these questions, 
I, for one, would like to hear the argument. </p>
<p><b>MR. WILSON</b>: Thank you, sir. </p>
<p>At the outset I should point out—I have pointed out—that 
we are not here defending a policy, and the determination that has been made is 
one of policy. We are here solely for the purpose of defending the right, the constitutional 
right, we contend, of the State of Kansas and of its own communities to make these 
determinations as to state and local policy on state and local levels. </p>
<p>We think that, regardless of all that has been said, and regardless of the extreme 
difficulty of these cases, of the fact that they do involve great moral and ethical 
and humanitarian principles, there are still some very basic considerations, so 
basic, in fact, that I am a little bit embarrassed to mention them to this Court after 
there has been so much argument. </p>
<p>But nevertheless, they are so very important that I think I must suggest, in 
the first place, that this is a union of states that are sovereign, except for only 
those purposes where they have delegated their sovereignty to the national authority; 
and I think, further, to determine the scope of the national authority, we must
look at the intent and the purpose of the instrument by which the authority was 
delegated. 
</p>
<p>I think in these arguments we frequently lose sight of the historic doctrine 
of separation of powers. We fail to distinguish between the legitimate sphere of 
judicial activity and the legislative or policy-making function; and if I may 
presume, it may have been that the Court had these things in mind when it 
suggested to us last summer that we answer certain questions by way of 
reargument, for certainly my studies, and apparently the studies of other 
counsel, have reinforced these basic considerations that this is a federal 
union; the national Government only possesses power delegated to it, and that the legislative must always be distinguished from the 
judicial function. </p>
<p>Now, as to the specific intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, the 
evidence has been examined in detail and I should not wish to repeat that which has been said. I can state generally, 
and I have stated generally, that we agree with the other appellees. We find the 
evidence to be persuasive that the Congress which submitted the Fourteenth Amendment did not contemplate that it would affect 
segregation in the public schools. </p>
<p>It may not be significant that all of the appellees in these cases—that is, all 
of the states, including the State of Delaware—have reached that conclusion working independently, but we do think it is significant 
that the Attorney General, in his brief, finds that the legislative history does 
not conclusively establish that Congress which proposed the Fourteenth Amendment specifically understood that 
it would abolish racial segregation in the public schools. </p>
<p>Now, we thought the question was rather specific. We thought the Court asked, 
was it specifically understood. We contend it was not. The Attorney General agrees 
it was not. That should dispose of that question. </p>
<p>I think perhaps in the discussion here there has been too much emphasis on 
contemporary intent. I want to suggest very briefly that the concept of equality 
and equal protection was not something that originated with the 39th Congress. 
For a long time prior to that the term &quot;equal protection&quot; had had a place in the 
understanding of the people and in the philosophy of government. Equal 
protection, as we study the record, the aims and objectives of the abolitionist 
societies, equal protection was meant to include those very basic rights, rights 
for which governments are established—the right to life, to liberty and 
property—and we think that it is in that sense that the term &quot;equal protection&quot; 
is used in the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p>We would point out that—we have pointed out in our brief—there is probably no occasion for pointing it out further—that there were specific 
denials in the Congress that civil rights and equal protection did comprehend the 
public schools and racial segregation therein. Mr. Davis quite eloquently, in his 
statement yesterday, expressed to the Court the conviction that the thrust of the Fourteenth 
Amendment was toward the institution of slavery. We think that is the case, and nothing more. </p>
<p>The Fourteenth Amendment was intended to embody the rights that are catalogued in the Civil Rights Act, and they are catalogued rather 
specifically. They are set out in this language: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That citizens will have the right in every State and Territory to make and enforce 
contracts, to sue, to be parties, to give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, 
sell, hold and convey real and personal property, and to the full and equal benefits 
of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we think this is the fruition of the whole abolitionist movement and the 
most complete expression of the consensus of abolitionist aims. </p>
<p>We think that the only purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to give constitutional status and dignity to these aims and objectives expressed in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and in them we find 
no place for the contention that racial segregation or the absence of racial segregation would be comprehended within their terms. </p>
<p>Turning to the states, we again find the same result; but our 
colleagues, or at least the other appellees in these cases, 
have discovered—we were unable to find a single instance where it appeared to us 
that a state, by reason of deference to the Fourteenth Amendment, had eliminated 
segregation from its public school system. On the other hand, we found that some 
24 of the states, either at the time of the adoption of the Amendment or within 
a few years thereafter, did legally sanction separate public schools. We found that 
ten states, including my own State of Kansas, that by the same legislature in the 
same year and, I think, perhaps in the same session, legislated with respect to 
segregated schools and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment. Now, we think that is 
positive evidence that the states, or at least a majority of the states, did not 
contemplate, did not understand, did not comprehend that the Fourteenth Amendment 
would preclude segregation in the public schools. </p>
<p>Kansas is, perhaps, unique in this case, because Kansas is a State with a pronounced 
abolitionist tradition. The other states, Virginia and South Carolina, were members 
of the Confederacy; Delaware, we are told by the Attorney General&#39;s brief, was sympathetic 
toward the Confederacy, although it remained in the Union. On the other hand, Kansas 
was an abolitionist State. The settlement of Kansas was inspired and financed by 
the Immigrant Aid Society of Boston. The first positive political influence in Kansas 
was the Free Soil Party, an offshoot of the abolitionists of the East. Certainly, 
Kansas is not subject to the accusation that can be hurled, perhaps, at the other 
states, that its tradition is rooted in the slave tradition. </p>
<p>But I mentioned a while ago the same legislature, and I might point out that 
this legislature was composed largely of Union veterans. Our historians tell us 
that Kansas contributed more troops to the Union armies in proportion to its population 
than any other state. Almost to a man, the legislature of 1867 was composed of those 
Union veterans, of men who had offered their lives for the cause of Negro freedom, 
and that legislature ratified routinely, as a matter of course, the Fourteenth Amendment.
</p>
<p>We infer from the Governor&#39;s message that ratification was deemed desirable because 
it was a part of the national Republican program, and the Republicans were in the 
ascendancy in Kansas. That same legislature, within about six weeks, enacted a statute 
providing for separate education for children of white and Negro races in cities 
of the second class. </p>
<p>Prior thereto, the statutes had provided for separate education, for optional 
separate education, in common school districts, that is, in the rural areas. A little 
later, a statute had been enacted authorizing separate education in cities of the 
first class, which then was cities of more than 7,000. Then you have the gap between 
the rural areas and the cities of more than 7,000, where segregation was not authorized. 
By the action of the legislature of 1867, which ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, 
the picture was completed in Kansas. Segregation was then authorized on all levels.
</p>
<p>Now, I point this out because it seems to me if we can infer any intention from 
our own legislative act, we must infer that the legislature recognized that within 
the State of Kansas there were areas where, by reason of lack of mutual understanding 
between the races, it would be impossible to provide equality of opportunity, assured 
by the Fourteenth Amendment, in integrated schools. Therefore, as a special benevolence, 
as a special device whereby equality to be assured in the Fourteenth Amendment could 
be complied with, the legislature of Kansas made it possible to establish separate 
schools in those areas. Now, again, that is only my inference. However, my adversaries 
infer also. </p>
<p>Now, to pass quickly to the other questions that are submitted, I think I have 
emphasized our position. We find that the Congress nor the state legislatures intended 
or comprehended or understood that segregation would be precluded by the Fourteenth 
Amendment. </p>
<p>The next question, of course, concerns the contemporary understanding of future 
intent, and again, we answer both questions in the negative. We cannot understand, 
we cannot conceive, of how a Congress or how state legislatures, in ratifying an 
amendment, could contemplate that in the future the limitations that they imposed 
upon that amendment might be enlarged by any agency or any branch of the Federal 
Government. The limitations were fixed by the intent that preceded and existed at 
the time of the adoption of the Amendment. We think those limitations were present 
in the minds of the Congress that submitted, and the states that ratified, the Amendment.
</p>
<p>We do not believe that any member of Congress intended that the basic relationship 
between the states and the Federal Government should be altered by the Amendment. 
We do not think that they contemplated that they were providing a means for amending 
the Constitution and giving it a meaning that it did not presently have. </p>
<p>We must admit that, if we are impelled in this instance, and looking only at 
the intent, to choose between the judicial and the congressional power, the choice 
would necessarily be the congressional. My understanding is not, perhaps, mature 
on this phase of the question, but, as I read these debates, there was throughout 
an emphasis on congressional power. </p>
<p>Undoubtedly the abolitionists had contemplated that Reconstruction 
might be affected by congressional action. The fact was that the Congress trusted 
neither the Executive nor the Judiciary to any extent, and so, looking at the intent 
of the Congress and the intent of the legislatures, we must concede that should 
the issue before this Court be one within the Amendment, within the federal competence, 
that it was then the intent of the framers that the Congress and not the courts 
should supply the redefinition or the impetus by which the particular subject is 
comprehended within the terms of the Amendment. </p>
<p>With respect to the judicial power, our argument is limited pretty much by our 
conclusions with respect to the intended future effect of the Amendment. Certainly, 
in commenting upon the subject of judicial power, we are confronted with a considerable 
amount of difficulty. </p>
<p>Obviously, the Judiciary has the power to determine the limitations of its power. 
Furthermore, any decision that this Court makes in this case will become the law 
of the case. In that sense, certainly the entire matter is within the judicial power. 
However, when we consider the historic exercise of the judicial power, we are constrained 
to recognize a great deal of limitation and restraint upon that exercise. </p>
<p>There is a case in which Justice Holmes has commented on the judicial power and 
particularly on the judicial power to legislate, in these words. He says that:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I recognize, without hesitation, that judges do and must legislate, but they 
do so only interstitially. They are confined from molar to molecular motion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think that at least that is the key or that is the essence of our understanding 
of the judicial power, to move from molar, from mass, to molecular motions, to refine 
the broad and general concepts that are included in the statute and in the constitutional 
provisions that are presented to the Court. </p>
<p>Certainly, it is not moving from the molar to the molecular to move outside the 
original intention, and with a sweeping gesture to bring into the Constitution a 
meaning, a view that was not entertained by the framers and those that gave the 
Amendment its effect. </p>
<p>That disposes of our general arguments with respect to the first three questions. 
The latter two questions of the Court deal with the remedy to be applied, which 
in this case may be moot. </p>
<p>The State of Kansas, of course, is not concerned with the immediate problems 
that will confront the Board of Education in complying with whatever decree or order 
this Court may enter. </p>
<p>We have taken the position that this Court need not concern itself in the Kansas 
case with a decree in detail, but should simply, in the event of reversal, remand 
the case to the district court with directions to form an appropriate decree. There 
are a number of considerations which must be taken into the purview of that court, 
but they are not for consideration here. </p>
<p>We appreciate very much the opportunity to be heard somewhat summarily in the 
circumstances of a moot case, and we hope that in considering this matter, this 
matter of constitutional right, the Court will not be unmindful of the constitutional 
right of the State of Kansas to set up and maintain its own school system and to 
initiate and maintain there the policies that are most beneficial to all of its 
people. </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF <br>
ROBERT L. CARTER, ESQ., <br>
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. CARTER</b>: I would like to say this, Your Honors: I do still have doubts with 
regard to the question of mootness in this case. However, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter 
pointed out, I would think it would not be likely that, having made this step, that 
Topeka would reverse itself, not in 1953. I am also confident that the State of 
Kansas, if this Court declares the statute unconstitutional with respect to South 
Carolina and Virginia, that the State of Kansas would abide by that decision.
</p>
<p>I might add that, insofar as I am concerned with respect to the arguments that 
have been urged by the Attorney General, since I do not feel he has opened any new 
avenues, it seems to me that in order to conserve the Court&#39;s time I will not speak.
