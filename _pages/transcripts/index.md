## Official Transcripts

The Supreme Court Library recently [digitized](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/archived_transcripts/1968)
all its "official" transcripts for cases argued since October 1968, which we have [catalogued](/transcripts/scotus) and
matched against the [Supreme Court Database](http://scdb.wustl.edu/).

## Unofficial Transcripts

All oral arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court cases from the 1955 Term onward were recorded by the Court on reel-to-reel
tape, which [The Oyez Project](https://www.oyez.org) finished digitizing and transcribing several years ago, so with only
a few exceptions (i.e., where the recording was lost, damaged, or incomplete), "unofficial" transcripts can be obtained
from their website for all cases argued since October 1955.
