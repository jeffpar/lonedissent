Back in 2005, I visited the [U.S. Supreme Court Library](/blog/2019/03/02/), and with librarian Brian Stiglmeier's help, I was able to browse their small collection of pre-1955 (aka "pre-Warren") transcripts, and using an on-site copier, I duplicated a tiny handful of them.  PDF versions of those transcripts are now available below.
