## Official Transcripts

The Supreme Court Library recently [digitized](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/archived_transcripts/1968)
all its "official" transcripts for cases argued since October 1968, which we have [catalogued](/transcripts/scotus/) and
matched against the [Supreme Court Database](http://scdb.wustl.edu/).

Prior to October 1968, the Supreme Court did not regularly commission transcripts, except when the Court deemed it
appropriate.  For example, all the oral arguments in [Brown v. Board of Education (I)](/transcripts/featured/brown1/)
and [Brown v. Board of Education (II)](/transcripts/featured/brown2/) were transcribed.

In even older cases, you'll occasionally find transcripts of arguments recorded in U.S. Reports.  [Norman v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep294/usrep294240/usrep294240.pdf) is one such case.  It records
the "arguments" of the attorneys for both Norman and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, as well as the "oral argument" of Attorney General Cummings, along with the following footnote:

> Mr. Cummings' address, stenographically reported, has been printed in full by the Government Printing Office.
Omissions from the present report are marked by dots. He also closed the argument in all of the cases.

The U.S. Reports volume makes clear that the "arguments" were simply extracted from the briefs, whereas the "oral argument"
was more like a conventional transcript -- except that it was edited, which severely compromises it as a record.  Fortunately,
a transcript "printed in full" presumably exists somewhere, and we can hope that someday all such "stenographically reported"
documents will become available online.

### Note Regarding Speakers

You may notice that, prior to October Term 2004, transcripts produced by the U.S. Supreme Court intentionally withheld the
names of the Justices who spoke during oral argument.  Instead of a name, transcripts would use "Q" or "QUESTION" to indicate
a question or other interjection from a Justice.

This policy was established by Chief Justice Earl Warren, presumably to create the illusion that the Court spoke with one voice,
but it's unclear exactly when the practice was adopted, since the Court did not routinely produce official transcripts until
October Term 1968.  The [Brown II](https://github.com/jeffpar/lonedissent/blob/master/sources/other/transcripts/1954/Brown_v_Board_II--1955-04-11.pdf)
transcripts from October Term 1954 *do* identify all the Justices by name, and the same is true of all older transcripts we've
seen as well.

Do not assume that any transcript from 1955 to 1968 is an "official" transcript, unless it includes a cover page from
the transcription service used by the Court.  Most transcripts from that time period actually come from either the University
Publications of America (UPA) microfiche collection, or the Landmark Briefs and Arguments (LBA) series, and they were simply
recreated by transcribing the audio recordings made during that period.  So in those cases, the lack of speaker names is a
question of effort, not of Court policy.

The policy was finally abandoned by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, beginning October Term 2004.

## Unofficial Transcripts

For cases prior to October Term 1968, you can find many unofficial transcripts in the aforementioned University
Publications of America (UPA) microfiche collection.  Transcripts for selected cases can also be found in the Landmark
Briefs and Arguments (LBA) series, and if a case predates the use of audio recordings, then its transcript may be at
least "semi-official"; however, without access to the source documents they used, it's hard to be sure.

All oral arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court cases from October 1955 onward were recorded by the Court on reel-to-reel
tape, which [The Oyez Project](https://www.oyez.org) finished digitizing and transcribing several years ago, so with only
a few exceptions (i.e., where the recording was lost, damaged, or incomplete), unofficial transcripts can be obtained
from their website for all such cases.

Other advantages of the Oyez transcripts: they also identify as many of the previously unidentified Justices as possible,
and they are synchronized with the audio.
