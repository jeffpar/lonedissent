"Loners" is our slang term for lone dissents.  This page provides links to collections of lone dissents
that we've generated so far.  The first collection is [Lone Dissents by Term](#lone-dissents-by-term),
with more collections to follow (e.g., By Justice).

Our collections will use three different opinion sources:

- Opinions stored at the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/collections/united-states-reports/)
- Opinions stored at the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) as [Bound Volumes](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/boundvolumes.aspx)
- Opinions stored at the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) as [Slip Opinions](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/18)

We prefer opinions in PDF format because they faithfully reproduce the printed versions.  Our *preferred*
preference would be to have access to an XML-based text source and render the opinions using HTML and CSS,
but (a) we don't have such a source, and (b) that's a lot of work.
