[Lone Dissents](/cases/loners) aren't the only kind of Supreme Court trivia we take an interest in.
We're also working on a comprehensive list of the top U.S. Supreme Court advocates (ie, lawyers who
have argued a large number of cases at the Court).

This is a multi-stage effort, which begins with our work to match all
[SCOTUS Transcripts](/transcripts/scotus) with their corresponding SCDB records. 
A list of those transcripts is being stored in a
[spreadsheet](https://github.com/jeffpar/lonedissent/blob/master/sources/ld/transcripts.csv),
which includes a `notes` field documenting any corrections.  Next, we'll cross-reference
the list with [Case Data](https://github.com/jeffpar/lonedissent/tree/master/sources/oyez/cases)
(from the 1955 term onward) extracted from the Oyez website.

Until that work is complete, here's a short list of some of the top performers of the modern era,
which we also refer to as the "Taped Era" (i.e., from October Term 1955 onward), because October
1955 was when Court began recording all oral arguments on reel-to-reel tape.

NOTE: Any advocate listed below whose total is reported as "at least" still requires further verification.

## Top Women Advocates

The [data](https://github.com/jeffpar/lonedissent/blob/master/sources/ld/women-advocates.csv) shown below is generated from
[documents](https://supremecourthistory.org/history_oral_advocates.html) created by [Marlene Trestman](https://www.marlenetrestman.com),
who painstakingly extracted appearances of women advocates from the [Journals of the Supreme Court of the United States](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/journal.aspx)
for October Term 1880 through October Term 1999.  This was later supplemented with data from 2000 through 2016 by Julie Silverbrook and Emma Shainwald.
We have extended the data through the end of February 2019, consulting a combination of Journals and [Transcripts](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2018).
