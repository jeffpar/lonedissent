[Lone Dissents](/cases/loners) aren't the only kind of Supreme Court trivia we take an interest in.  We're also working
on a comprehensive list of the top U.S. Supreme Court advocates (ie, lawyers who have argued a large number of cases at the Court).

Until that work is complete, here's a short list of some of the top performers.  The only advocate for whom the total has been
verified is Lawrence Wallace, who argued 157 times and is the current modern record holder (of the 20th and 21st centuries).
The previous 20th century record was 140 arguments.
