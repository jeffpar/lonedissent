We're working on a comprehensive list of the top U.S. Supreme Court advocates (ie, lawyers who have argued a large number of cases at the Court).

Until that work is complete, here's a short list of some of the top performers.  The only lawyer for whom the total has been verified is Lawrence Wallace,
who argued 157 times and is the current modern record holder (of the 20th and 21st centuries).  The previous 20th century record was 140 arguments.

- [Lawrence Wallace](/advocates/top100/lawrence_wallace) (157 arguments)
