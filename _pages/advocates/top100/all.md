[Lone Dissents](/cases/loners) aren't the only kind of Supreme Court trivia we take an interest in.
We're also working on a comprehensive list of the top U.S. Supreme Court advocates (ie, lawyers who
have argued a large number of cases at the Court).

Until that work is complete, here's a short list of some of the top performers of the modern era,
which we also refer to as the "Taped Era" (i.e., from October Term 1955 onward), because October 1955
was when Court began recording all oral arguments on reel-to-reel tape.

The only advocates for whom we have verified the totals shown below are [Lawrence G. Wallace](/advocates/top100/lawrence_wallace) and [Edwin S. Kneedler](/advocates/top100/edwin_kneedler).
