# Terms of The Court

As we first noted in our [Index of U.S. Supreme Court Lone Dissents](/cases/loners#notes-on-terms),
the period of time spanned by a "term" or session of the Court has varied over the years.

Moreoever, there are two different kinds of Court terms: [Regular Terms](#regular-terms) and
[Special Terms](#special-terms).  And then there are what we'll call [Terms of Convenience](#terms-of-convenience),
until a better, um, term becomes clear.

## Regular Terms

The first Judiciary Act, passed in 1789, required the Supreme Court to hold two sessions (terms) per year,
beginning on the first Monday in February and again on the first Monday in August.

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/6th-congress/c6.pdf#page=125) passed on February 13, 1801,
terms were changed to the first Monday of June and December:

    SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
    Representatives of the United States of America in
    Congress assembled, That from and after the next session
    of the Supreme Court of the United States, the said court
    shall be holden by the justices thereof, or any four of
    them, at the city of Washington, and shall have two
    sessions in each and every year thereafter, to commence
    on the first Monday of June and December respectively;

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/7th-congress/c7.pdf#page=29) passed on April 29, 1802,
terms were changed to the first Monday of February, reducing the number of sessions per year to one:

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
    of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
    from and after the passing of this act, the Supreme Court
    of the United States shall be holden by the justices thereof,
    or any four of them, at the city of Washington, and shall
    have one session in each and every year, to commence on the
    first Monday of February annually;
    ...
    And so much of the act, intituled "An act to establish the
    judicial courts of the United States," passed the twenty-fourth
    day of September, seventeen hundred and eighty-nine, as provides
    for the holding a session of the supreme court of the United
    States on the first Monday of August, annually, is hereby
    repealed.

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/19th-congress/session-1/c19s1ch37.pdf) passed on May 4, 1826,
terms were changed to the second Monday of January:

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
    of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That,
    from and after the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-six,
    the session of the Supreme Court, heretofore held on the first
    Monday of February annually, shall, instead thereof, be held on
    the second Monday of January annually;

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/28th-congress/session-1/c28s1ch96.pdf) passed on June 17, 1844,
terms were changed to the first Monday of December:

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
    of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
    That from and after the passage of this act, the sessions
    of the Supreme Court, heretofore commenced and held on the
    second Monday of January, annually, shall instead thereof
    be commenced and held the first Monday of December, annually;

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/42nd-congress/session-3/c42s3ch64.pdf) passed on January 24, 1873,
terms were changed to the second Monday of October:

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
    of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
    from and after the passage of this act the annual session of
    the Supreme Court of the United States shall commence on the
    second Monday of October in each year....

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/64th-congress/session-1/c64s1ch447.pdf#page=2) passed on September 6, 1916, terms were changed to the first Monday of October:

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
    of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
    section two hundred and thirty of an Act to codify, revise,
    and amend the laws relating to the judiciary, approved March
    third, nineteen hundred and eleven, known as the Judicial
    Code, be, and it hereby is, amended so as to read as follows:

    "SEC. 230. The Supreme Court shall hold at the seat of
    government one term annually, commencing on the first Monday
    in October, and such adjourned or special terms as it may find
    necessary for the dispatch of business."

## Special Terms

Ordinarily, we assume that a term ends *only* once the following term has begun.
For example, October Term 1942 began on Monday, October 5, 1942, so logically October Term 1941
would have ended the day before.  That certainly seems to be the modern practice, at any rate
(see the [McConnell](#terms-of-convenience) case below).

And yet, here we see there was a Special Term in July 1942, which included arguments on July 29-30 and a
decision on July 31.

It seems likely that there was a change in Supreme Court rules at some point that would account for
when there would be (or would no longer be) special terms, but as yet, we've not identified anything.

- [COOPER ET AL. v. AARON ET AL.](http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep358/usrep358001/usrep358001.pdf)

### JULY SPECIAL TERM, 1972

## Terms of Convenience

The following cases illustrate changes over time in the creation (or avoidance) of special terms.

[UNITED STATES v. NIXON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ET AL.](http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep418/usrep418683/usrep418683.pdf)
was argued July 8, 1974, decided July 24, 1974, and reported in U.S. Reports as part of October Term 1973.
This makes some sense, because apparently the Court had not yet issued its final 1973 Term opinion until July 8
(see SECRETARY OF THE NAVY v. AVRECH, 418 U.S. 676), so the Court had not yet adjourned; however, the case must
have been a very late addition to the calendar.

[McCONNELL ET AL. v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION ET AL.](http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep540/usrep540093/usrep540093.pdf)
was argued September 8, 2003, *before* the start of October Term 2003, but since it wasn't decided
until December 10, 2003, *after* the start of the 2003 term, it was considered part of that term.

It's worth noting that, at the beginning of argument on September 8, Chief Justice Rehnquist said:

    Today we'll break for lunch and reconvene at 1:30 and the court will be in recess from today until
    the first Monday in October 2003, at which time the October 2002 term of the court will be adjourned
    and the October 2003 term of the court will begin as provided by statute.

It's unclear to us exactly what the Chief Justice's intent was in making that announcement.  Perhaps he was simply
trying to sidestep the need for declaring a Special Term.
