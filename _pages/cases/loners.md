"Loners" is our slang for lone dissents.  This page provides links to all known lone dissents
of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The following collections are now available:

- [Lone Dissents by Term](#lone-dissents-by-term)
- [Lone Dissents by Justice](/justices/loners)

Our collections use three different opinion sources:

- Opinions stored at the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/collections/united-states-reports/)
- Opinions stored at the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) as [Bound Volumes](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/boundvolumes.aspx)
- Opinions stored at the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) as [Slip Opinions](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/18)

We prefer opinions in PDF format because they faithfully reproduce the printed versions.  Our *preferred*
preference would be to have access to an XML-based text source and render the opinions using HTML and CSS,
but (a) we don't have such a source, and (b) that's a lot of work.

Finally, if you're looking for [all opinions](/cases/all), not merely lone dissents, there are some additional
collections you can browse, with more coming soon:

- [Opinions by Term](/cases/all#opinions-by-term)
- [Opinions by Justice](/justices/all)

## Notes on Terms

A short history of Supreme Court terms is provided below, to provide some context for the list that follows.
For more detail, see [Terms of The Court](/cases/terms).

---

The first Judiciary Act, passed in 1789, required the Supreme Court to hold two sessions (terms) per year,
beginning on the first Monday in February and again on the first Monday in August.

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/6th-congress/c6.pdf#page=125) passed on February 13, 1801,
terms were changed to the first Monday of June and December:

    SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
    Representatives of the United States of America in
    Congress assembled, That from and after the next session
    of the Supreme Court of the United States, the said court
    shall be holden by the justices thereof, or any four of
    them, at the city of Washington, and shall have two
    sessions in each and every year thereafter, to commence
    on the first Monday of June and December respectively;

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/7th-congress/c7.pdf#page=29) passed on April 29, 1802,
terms were changed to the first Monday of February, reducing the number of sessions per year to one:

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
    of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
    from and after the passing of this act, the Supreme Court
    of the United States shall be holden by the justices thereof,
    or any four of them, at the city of Washington, and shall
    have one session in each and every year, to commence on the
    first Monday of February annually;
    ...
    And so much of the act, intituled "An act to establish the
    judicial courts of the United States," passed the twenty-fourth
    day of September, seventeen hundred and eighty-nine, as provides
    for the holding a session of the supreme court of the United
    States on the first Monday of August, annually, is hereby
    repealed.

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/19th-congress/session-1/c19s1ch37.pdf) passed on May 4, 1826,
terms were changed to the second Monday of January:

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
    of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That,
    from and after the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-six,
    the session of the Supreme Court, heretofore held on the first
    Monday of February annually, shall, instead thereof, be held on
    the second Monday of January annually;

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/28th-congress/session-1/c28s1ch96.pdf) passed on June 17, 1844,
terms were changed to the first Monday of December.

NOTE: Even though this change occurred in 1844, you may notice that the Court continued to call their terms
"January" terms, until December 1850 when it finally began referring to them as December terms.  This change
does *not* mean there were two terms in 1850, as [some would suggest](http://scdb.wustl.edu/documentation.php?var=term).
1844 was the year there were actually two terms: January Term 1844, and "January Term 1845", which began in December 1844.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
    of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
    That from and after the passage of this act, the sessions
    of the Supreme Court, heretofore commenced and held on the
    second Monday of January, annually, shall instead thereof
    be commenced and held the first Monday of December, annually;

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/42nd-congress/session-3/c42s3ch64.pdf) passed on January 24, 1873,
terms were changed to the second Monday of October:

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
    of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
    from and after the passage of this act the annual session of
    the Supreme Court of the United States shall commence on the
    second Monday of October in each year....

Then by [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/64th-congress/session-1/c64s1ch447.pdf#page=2) passed on September 6, 1916, terms were changed to the first Monday of October:

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
    of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
    section two hundred and thirty of an Act to codify, revise,
    and amend the laws relating to the judiciary, approved March
    third, nineteen hundred and eleven, known as the Judicial
    Code, be, and it hereby is, amended so as to read as follows:

    "SEC. 230. The Supreme Court shall hold at the seat of
    government one term annually, commencing on the first Monday
    in October, and such adjourned or special terms as it may find
    necessary for the dispatch of business."

&#42; Technically, January Terms 1845 through 1850 were actually December Terms 1844 through 1849; the Court apparently
preferred to adhere to its previous naming convention, at least for six more years.  Refer to the following [Statute](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/28th-congress/session-1/c28s1ch96.pdf) passed on June 17, 1844 (see [above](#notes-on-terms)).
