<p style="text-align:center"><b>PROCEEDINGS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: No. 2, <i>Harry Briggs, Jr., et al.</i>, versus <i>R. W. Elliott, 
et al</i>. </p>
<p><b>THE CLERK</b>: Counsel are present. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>OPENING ARGUMENT OF <br />
SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, ESQ., <br />
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>At the outset, I should like to point out that the argument in No. 2 and the 
argument in No. 4 are being combined. Mr. Marshall and I are offering two separate appeals, as I have already outlined, the appeal 
in No. 2 and the appeal in No. 4, and for this reason at the outset I would like 
the indulgence of the Court, before stating the facts, to outline the argument and the part that he will present 
and the part that I will undertake to present. </p>
<p>After stating the facts and the procedural matters, I propose to address myself 
to questions one and two of the Court, and to discuss the historical evidence which 
we submit demonstrates that the Congress that submitted it and the legislatures 
and conventions that ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, contemplated and understood that it would 
abolish segregation in public schools; that future congresses might in the exercise 
of their power under section 5 of the Amendment abolish segregation, and also, that 
it would be within the jurisdictional power in the light of future conditions
to construe the Amendment as abolishing segregation of its own force. </p>
<p>Mr. Marshall will then address himself to questions three, four, and five, and 
will present our arguments demonstrating that it is within the jurisdictional power 
in construing the Amendment to abolish segregation in public schools and our position 
with respect to the disposition that this Court should make of these cases in the event that 
it is decided that segregation in public schools violates the Fourteenth Amendment.
</p>
<p>Both of these cases are rearguments of appeals from final decrees of three-judge district courts, in the instance of No. 2 from the Eastern District 
of South Carolina; in the instance of No. 4, from the Eastern District of Virginia.
</p>
<p>In each of these cases, Negro children and their respective 
parents and guardians sued competent county school authorities, alleging that by 
requiring these and other Negro children to attend separate Negro schools as commanded 
by the constitutions and the laws of South Carolina and Virginia respectively, they 
denied them rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. In each of these cases the 
appellants sought decrees declaring the invalidity of the state school segregation 
provisions and injunctions restraining the appellees from enforcing these provisions and from restricting Negro children on a racial basis in their requiring attendance in the public 
schools. </p>
<p>In case No. 2, the majority of the district court, with Judge Waring dissenting, 
following the original hearing of that case in that court filed an opinion and entered 
a final decree requiring the appellees to afford the appellants involved in that 
case equal facilities, but declaring that the contested constitutional and statutory provisions were 
valid, and refusing to grant the requested injunctive relief. </p>
<p>On appeal from this decree this Court, Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Black 
dissenting, vacated the judgment, that is, the first decree of the district court, 
and remanded the case for the purpose of obtaining the view of the district court 
upon additional facts in the record presented by a report which was subsequently 
filed in the district court by the appellees, and to give the district court the 
opportunity to take such action as it might deem appropriate in the light of the facts disclosed by that report. </p>
<p>The district court then proceeded to have a second hearing. Judge Waring, in 
the meanwhile, had retired from the bench. Upon this occasion, after the hearing the district court filed another opinion and 
entered another final decree, this time unanimously, again declaring the school 
segregation provision valid, and refusing to grant injunctive relief. </p>
<p>In case No. 4, the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia likewise 
found inequalities in physical facilities and curricula, and likewise, it ordered that these inequalities be eliminated. But as the district court in No. 2, it refused to invalidate or to enjoin the 
enforcement of the school segregation provisions. </p>
<p>These cases were argued before this Court at the last term. On last June 8 the 
Court entered an order directing reargument in the case and requesting counsel to 
address themselves to five questions set forth in the order so far as those questions would be relevant to the issues involved in the respective cases. It is pursuant, of course, to 
that order that we are here today. </p>
<p>I think that it is highly significant at the outset to note that each of these 
cases was brought pursuant to the authority conferred by the Act of April 20, 1871, section 1 of that Act, which is now codified in large measure in Title 8 of the United States Code, section 43. 
That Act was entitled: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An Act to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and for other purposes.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the Court is well aware, the Act provided, as does the present section, although the present section does not exactly conform to the original Act, though essentially the same provisions are there, that:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Any person who, under color of any law of any State, subjects or causes to be 
subjected any person within the jurisdiction of the United States to the deprivation 
of any rights secured by the Constitution of the United States shall be liable to 
the party injured in an action at law, a suit in equity or other proper proceeding 
for redress. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Involved in these cases is a statute which in the viewpoint of the appellants 
is in violation of the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. In section 
43 of Title 8 we have a statute which, in the enforcement of the provisions of the 
Fourteenth Amendment, creates a cause of action and confers both the power and the 
duty upon the federal courts to enforce that cause of action. We submit that the statute imposes a positive duty upon the courts to determine 
whether, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the action of a state in imposing racial 
segregation in public education is valid. </p>
<p>I would like now to proceed to an examination of the history of the formulation, 
the proposal and the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, as an aid to the Court&#39;s determination of whether the laws involved 
in these cases can stand consistently with the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment.
</p>
<p><b>Our position is this</b>: Considering the overall evidence derived from the debates 
and proceedings on the Fourteenth Amendment, these conclusions are supported:
</p>
<p>First, that the Amendment had as its purpose and effect the complete legal equality 
of all persons, irrespective of race, and the prohibition of all state-imposed caste 
and class systems based upon race. </p>
<p>And secondly, that segregation in public schools, constituting as it does legislation 
of this type, is necessarily embraced within the prohibitions of the Amendment.
</p>
<p>Going first to the debates on the Fourteenth Amendment itself, there is considerable evidence of the intention of the framers
to broadly provide for the complete legal equality of all 
men, irrespective of race, and to broadly proscribe all caste and class legislation based upon race or color. There is also some reference specifically to the impact which the proposed Amendment would have upon state-imposed segregation 
in public schools. I propose to address myself to both categories of evidence.
</p>
<p>When the 39th Congress, which formulated the Fourteenth Amendment, convened in 
December of 1865, it was cognizant of, and it was confronted with, the so-called 
Black Codes which had been enacted throughout the southern states. In brief summary, 
these laws imposed and were designed to maintain essentially the same inferior position 
which Negroes had occupied prior to the abolition of slavery. As a matter of fact, 
they followed pretty much the legal pattern of the antebellum slave codes. </p>
<p>For example, they compelled Negroes to work for limited pay, they restricted 
their mobility, they prohibited their testimony in court against a white person, 
and contained innumerable provisions for segregation on carriers and in public places. In some of these codes there 
were expressed prohibitions upon the attendance by Negroes of the public schools 
provided for white children. </p>
<p>I would like to emphasize, as this Court has in its previous decisions recognized, 
that the existence of these laws was largely responsible for the Fourteenth Amendment 
and the contemporaneous civil rights legislation. </p>
<p>We find in the debates and proceedings on the Fourteenth Amendment abundant evidence 
demonstrating that the radical Republicans in the 39th Congress desired and intended 
that the Fourteenth Amendment would effect both the invalidation of the existing 
Black Codes and any and all future attempts to impose governmental caste distinctions 
predicated upon race. </p>
<p>Among the items of evidence which demonstrate this broad overall purpose in effect 
of the Amendment, I would like to make reference to the following: When the resolution 
was introduced into the Senate which embraced the provision which is now section
1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, with simply the addition of the citizenship clause—in 
other words, House Resolution 127—Senate Howard opened the debate in the Senate—as a matter of fact, he was speaking for 
the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which had formulated the provision, mindful, 
as I said before, that it did not yet contain the citizenship clause, but did contain 
the privileges or immunities, the equal protection and due process clauses—speaking 
for the Joint Committee, because Senator Fessenden, one of its co-chairmen, was ill, he made these significant statements. 
</p>
<p>He referred to the last two clauses of the first section. He said that these 
two clauses disabled a state from depriving not merely a citizen of the United States, 
but any person, whoever he may be, of life, liberty or property without due process 
of law, and from denying him the equal protection of the laws. This, Senator Howard
says, abolishes all class legislation in the states and does away with the injustice, 
of subjecting one caste of persons to a code not applicable to another. It prohibits 
the hanging of a black man for a crime for which the white man is not hanged. It 
protects the black man in his fundamental rights as a citizen with the same shield 
which it throws around the white man. 
</p>
<p>Here we have an explicit declaration by one of the co-chairmen of the committee of Congress which formulated what is now essentially section 
1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that is the scope that he ascribed to it. As 
a matter of fact, during the course of the same speech introducing the bill into 
Congress, Senator Howard had this to say: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I look upon the first section, taken in connection with the fifth section, as very important. It will, if adopted by the states, 
forever disable every one of them from passing laws infringing upon those fundamental rights and privileges which pertain to citizens of the 
United States and to all persons who may happen to be within their jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>It establishes equality before the law, it gives to the humblest, the poorest, 
the most despised of the race the same rights and the same protection before the law that it gives 
to the most powerful, the most wealthy and the most haughty. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, certainly in the opinion of Senator Howard, the due process and 
equal protection clauses would sweep away, in his language, all class legislation.
</p>
<p>Similarly, during the Senate debates, Senator Poland addressed himself to section 1, and he made a somewhat similar declaration. As a matter 
of fact, he pointed out the existence of the Black Codes. He made reference to them 
specifically: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We know that state laws exist and some of them of very recent enactment, in direct 
violation of these principles. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he went on to give the Amendment the scope which he thought it was entitled 
to. </p>
<p>The statements in this regard were by no means confined to the proponents of 
the Amendment. As a matter of fact, after the citizenship clause had been added 
to the Amendment, Senator Davis of Kentucky had this to say: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The real and only object of the first provision of this section— </p>
</blockquote>
<p>—speaking of the citizenship clause which the Senate has added to it— </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>—is to make Negroes citizens, to prop the Civil Rights bill and to give them 
a more plausible if not a valid claim to its provisions, to press forward to a full community 
of civil and political rights with the white race, for which its authors are struggling 
and mean to continue to struggle. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over in the House, when Representative Stevens introduced Resolution 127, he 
made a similar declaration with respect to scope: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I can hardly believe that any person can be found who will not admit that every 
one of these provisions is just. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, Congressman Stevens says they are all asserted in some form or another in our Declaration or organic law. He pointed out, however, 
that the Constitution limits the action of Congress; that in this area it was not 
a limitation upon the states and said that the Amendment supplied that defect and 
allowed Congress to correct the unjust legislation of the states—and here again 
referring to the Black Codes—insofar as that law which operates upon one man shall operate equally upon all. </p>
<p>He later on made further reference to the fact that the Amendment was made necessary 
by what he termed the oppressive codes which had become law in the southern states, pointing out that unless the 
Constitution should restrain these states, &quot;those states will, I fear&quot;—to use his 
language—&quot;will all keep up this discrimination, and crush to death the hated freedmen.&quot;
</p>
<p>And just as in the Senate, we had others who took the floor in the discussion. 
I might make reference to the statement which was made by Congressman Randall of 
Pennsylvania, the statement that was made by Congressman Rogers of New Jersey. Now, these were men who opposed 
the Amendment. Yet, their statements, which we have set forth in our brief, show that they also recognized as one of 
the clauses, as the great occasion for the Fourteenth Amendment, the existence of 
these racial laws in southern states, and recognized that if the Amendment were in fact adopted, it would have 
an impact upon such laws of the character which we describe. </p>
<p>I should also like to direct the Court&#39;s attention specifically to the statement 
of Mr. Bingham, who has very appropriately been described as the Madison of the 
first section of the Fourteenth Amendment. Mr. Bingham made a very notable speech 
in the House during the debates on the Amendment. </p>
<p>He said that the need for the first section was, to use his language, </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>. . . one of the lessons that had been taught by the history of the past four 
years of terrific conflict. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He pointed out that the Amendment did not take away rights which were properly 
reserved to the states, for in his opinion, and in his language, </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No state ever had the right under the forms of law, or otherwise, to deny to 
any freedmen the equal protection of the law or to abridge the privileges or immunities 
of any citizen of the Republic, although many of them have assumed and exercised that power and that without remedy. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going specifically to the evidence which was directed to the issue of public 
school segregation, I should like first to point out that on the Fourteenth Amendment 
debates proper, we find only one specific reference to school segregation, and that 
was the reference that was made in the House by Representative Rogers at the time that Resolution 
No. 63 was up for consideration. Resolution 63 was the predecessor of 127, and the relationship between the two of them I 
shall undertake to establish in just a moment. But during his speech, Representative 
Rogers made a direct attack upon the proposed Amendment, which at that time simply 
provided that Congress should have the power to make all laws which shall be necessary 
and proper to secure to the citizens of each state all privileges and immunities 
of citizens of the several states, and to all persons in the several states equal 
protection in the rights of life, liberty and property. </p>
<p>Perhaps I should undertake at this moment to demonstrate that connection which 
I mentioned. H. R. 63 was the bill which had been reported by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, and it was a bill 
drafted by Mr. Bingham. H. R. 127, which eventually became, with two significant 
changes, the Fourteenth Amendment, was also drafted so far as the provisions of 
section 1 of the Amendment were concerned by Mr. Bingham. </p>
<p>Mr. Bingham introduced Resolution 63 in the House first and it is notable at 
this point to say two things which I think are very significant. In the first place, H. R. 63 was proposed 
simply to grant to Congress the power to enact laws of a certain character. Pursuant to this authority, assuming as I do that this would have been the construction 
given to H. R. 63 had it become a constitutional amendment, pursuant to this authority Congress might undertake to pass laws which 
would outlaw this or that embraced within the scope of the prohibition. Later on—and 
the proceedings of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction indicate the various drafts, the various 
attempts, the various procedures which were gone through and finally deriving the 
present language of the trilogy of the first section—the form was changed, and it 
was changed and rewritten by Mr. Bingham to state as a direct prohibition upon the states the disabilities with respect to the things which were embraced 
within that section. </p>
<p>Now it was, as I said before, at the time that H. R. 63 came up for consideration 
in the House that Representative Rogers made reference to school segregation. As 
a matter of fact, he attacked this proposal. He termed it &quot;more dangerous to the liberties of the people and the foundations of the Government than any proposal for amending 
the Constitution heretofore advanced.&quot; He said this Amendment would destroy all 
state legislation distinguishing Negroes on the basis of race. With respect to schools specifically, he had this to say: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the State of Pennsylvania there are laws which make a distinction with regard 
to the schooling of white children and the schooling of black children. It is provided 
that certain schools shall be designated and set apart for white children, and certain 
other schools designated and set apart for black children. </p>
  <p>Under this amendment Congress would have the power to compel the state to provide 
for white children and black children to attend the same school upon the principle that all the people shall have equal protection 
and all the rights of life, liberty and property and all the privileges and immunities 
of citizens of the several states. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that it is also highly significant that during these debates no one denied that H. R. 63 had the scope that Mr. Rogers said that it did.
</p>
<p>Throughout the debates there is practically no dispute as to the scope of H. 
R. 127, which eventually became the trilogy of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a matter 
of fact, Representative Bingham, who was contemporaneously amending the 1866 Civil Rights Act, to which I will make reference shortly, because of its broad anti-discrimination 
provisions, and claiming that it lacked constitutional foundation, naturally did not make any dispute of Representative Rogers&#39; appraisal of the wide scope of H. R. 63. On the contrary, Mr. Bingham 
in a colloquy with Mr. Hale two days later indicated his appraisal in just about 
the same terms. He was asked at that time a question in that regard, and at that 
time Mr. Bingham pointed to the equal protection clause of his constitutional proposal as justifying 
the scope which he attributed to the Amendment. </p>
<p>In addition to the debates and proceedings on the Fourteenth Amendment proper, 
there is other evidence which in our opinion is helpful in promoting an understanding 
of the purposes and effects of the Fourteenth Amendment and of the correctness of our conclusions in this 
regard. One of the most important of these items of evidence in my opinion is the 
Civil Rights Act of 1866. The 39th Congress had an occasion to contemporaneously 
consider, in addition to the Fourteenth Amendment, this piece of civil rights legislation.
</p>
<p>I think that it is very important that at the outset I should point out that 
these two measures are related—this measure, rather, is related to the Fourteenth Amendment by something more than a mere coincidence 
in terms of time or subject matter. The Fourteenth Amendment was actually proposed 
after members of the 39th Congress stated that the civil rights guaranteed by statute, particularly the Civil Rights Act of 1866, were vulnerable to future political 
attack or might be struck down as unconstitutional. Consequently, the legislative history of the Act of 1866 is a relevant and important part of the background of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is particularly 
true in our opinion since, as I will later undertake to show, the scope of the Fourteenth 
Amendment was broader than the scope of this Act. </p>
<p>Going through this as deeply as time will permit, the Civil Rights Act came about 
in the form of a bill introduced by Senator Trumbull which intended to prohibit, 
in the terms of the bill, &quot;any discrimination in civil rights or immunities among 
the people of the United States on account of race, color or previous condition 
of servitude,&quot; and also containing other provisions to the effect that all persons 
should have full and equal benefit of all laws for the security of their persons 
and property, and enumerating certain rights, the right to sue, the right to make contracts, to own and inherit property 
and that type of thing, which the latter provision would provide. </p>
<p>Senator Trumbull introduced the bill and, upon its introduction, he gave it a very broad scope. He said that in his opinion any 
statute which was based on race, which was not equal to 
all persons and which deprived any citizen of civil rights which are secured to other citizens, is in fact a badge of servitude which in his opinion was prohibited 
by the Constitution. </p>
<p>When the bill was introduced, there were two things that were considered by the 
houses of Congress with regard to this Act. First was its constitutionality, and 
I don&#39;t think I need to needlessly consume the time of the Court on that issue, 
but simply point out that opponents of the bill took the position there was nothing 
in the Constitution at that time to justify the enactment of such a law. There were 
others on the other side who asserted that the bill was constitutional. </p>
<p>And the second big issue that was involved in the proceedings in this regard 
was the scope of the bill. Time and again the Democrats and the more conservative Republicans in the Senate and in the other house of 
Congress had occasion to state that this bill, if Congress passed it, would have 
a very, very broad effect. It would have an effect which would deprive the states 
of all power to make or impose racial distinctions or classifications, and some 
of these people made specific reference to the impact of the provisions of the first 
section of this bill, the &quot;no discrimination&quot; of this bill upon public school segregation.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Mr. Robinson, what attitude do you think the Court is 
called upon to manage, what weight is to be given, or how is it to ever deal with 
individual utterances of this, that or other congressman or senator? </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: I do not, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, take the position, as this Court 
has on previous occasions stated that it would insist that the meaning of a constitutional 
provision or of a statute is to be determined by any isolated statement of any individual
proponent or opponent of the legislation. At the outset, however, I tried to 
point out what was the great occasion, in other words, what there was in the history 
of the times which presented the occasion for the constitutional amendment. Perhaps 
I should have earlier pointed out that the same thing, the racial laws in the southern 
states, constituted the basis, the occasion for the enactment, for the promulgation and eventual enactment in limited form, of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1866. 
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Do you think we can get out of the debates anything 
more than Mr. Justice Miller got out of them at the time of the Slaughter-House 
Cases? </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: Yes, I think so, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. As I recall Mr. Justice 
Miller&#39;s opinion in the Slaughter-House Cases, he recognized also that the great purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, the occasion for the enactment of it, for the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment—and 
I think that what additionally we got out of the debate is not simply a statement 
here or a statement there with respect to the broad overall purpose and effect, 
the fundamental thing that a constitutional amendment is supposed to accomplish, 
but what we get is a general understanding by people who are in the body promulgating 
that provision as to what scope it was intended to have. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: And the understanding you get or you think we ought 
to get goes beyond the terms which Justice Miller put it in the Slaughter-House 
Cases. </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: Well, I do not in any wise, of course, intend in any way to cut 
down on anything that Mr. Justice Miller stated in that connection. We offer the 
evidence in the congressional debates on the Amendment and other debates— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I grant you we solicited and elicited that. But I just 
wondered, now that we have got it, what are we to get out of it? The fact that a 
man in your position says, &quot;This is a terrible measure and if you pass it we will 
do this and that&quot;; does that tell me that this measure does do this and that?
</p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: To this extent, sir. So far as the statement standing alone is concerned, I would attribute no value to it. But when a man makes that 
statement and he is joined in it by others, he is not disputed by anyone, we have 
a condition of general understanding that is demonstrated by the overall statements pro and con in that particular 
connection. I think we get assistance. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: You think if an opponent gives an extreme interpretation 
of a proposed statute or constitutional amendment in order to frighten people on 
the other side, and the proponents do not get up and say, &quot;Yes, this is the thing 
we want to accomplish,&quot; that means they believe, do you? </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: Well, I will have to put it in these terms. I would not, of course, 
sir, know the motive of the person making that statement. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I know, but what does silence mean? </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: I think when you have statement after statement with respect to broad overall purpose— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: By individual members? 
</p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: By individual members.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That the proposal has— </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: On other sides, if you please, on both sides, coupled with the 
fact of almost an entire absence of evidence to the contrary showing that anyone 
there had a different understanding or a different opinion as to what scope it would have. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Namely, they wanted this proposal to put an end to treating white and colored differently before the law in all its manifestations? </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: That is correct, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is all you get out of it? </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: In all 
of its manifestations. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Then the question is whether this is one of its manifestations.
</p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: I beg your pardon, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Then the question is whether this is one of its manifestations.
</p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: Our position in this regard, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, is that when you consider overall what these people said, what from the facts 
of history it appears, what Mr. Justice Miller, if you please, said was the purpose 
and the intended scope of the Amendment, we cope [come?] up with a broad, general purpose 
that necessarily embraces a prohibition against the type of state activity which we have presented 
to the Court in these cases. I do not mean in any respect to divorce from the other 
factors which this Court normally utilizes to determine the scope of a constitutional 
amendment, the debates and proceedings, but simply to relate them in the fashion in which 
I have undertaken to do. </p>
<p>I will simply make reference to the remaining congressional legislation, out 
of the consideration of time. As I have pointed out, Senator Cowan of Pennsylvania 
in the Senate made a specific reference to the scope of the Civil Rights Act in 
its original form, stating that it would outlaw school segregation. </p>
<p>Senator Howard made a statement with respect to its outlawing all state laws discriminating on the basis of civil rights. As a matter of fact, 
as we have set forth in our brief, there was speech after speech in each house devoted 
not only to the broad general intention of the Act, but also with respect to segregation 
in public schools. Over in the House, the same Representative Rogers who said that 
the Fourteenth Amendment would abolish school segregation said that the original form of the Civil Rights Act would also have that effect.
</p>
<p>Now the importance of all that comes to this. After all of this discussion, particularly 
the raising of objections as to the constitutionality of the Act, Representative Bingham took the floor, stated that he was thoroughly 
in favor of the provisions of the thing which the proponents of the Act were attempting 
to accomplish. He had an objection not to the scope of the bill, but he did have 
one to its constitutionality. He then stated that in his opinion, while the objectives 
were properly to be attained, they were to be attained by a constitutional amendment, 
and not by a statute which in his opinion was not justified by the provisions of 
the Constitution as it then existed. He made it very plain, however, that his objection in this 
particular regard was not the scope. His objection was to constitutionality. </p>
<p>Now, as a matter of history, Mr. Bingham had just introduced in the House a few days before H. R. 63 which was, as I have said, the forerunner 
of the Fourteenth Amendment; so consequently, he already had before the Congress a proposal which, if adopted, would in his 
opinion constitute or provide a constitutional basis for the type of legislation which was involved in the Civil Rights Act.
</p>
<p>Now, at this point the discussions and the debates make it perfectly plain that 
the actions of the Congress in eliminating the broad no-discrimination clause in 
the first part of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and enacting the rest, the balance 
of the Act in a more limited form, did so for the reasons that were suggested by 
Mr. Bingham. As a matter of fact, in this regard we haven&#39;t been able to find anything 
in history that discloses, as our opponents contend, that the rights which are embraced in, and the prohibitions imposed by, the Fourteenth 
Amendment are no larger than those which are embraced in or imposed by the Civil 
Rights Act of 1866. </p>
<p>I think this contention ignores the evolution of the Fourteenth Amendment in 
so far as its relation to the Civil Rights Act of 1866 is concerned. It will be 
recalled, as I have previously said, that some members of Congress stated that the 
bill in its original form would outlaw school segregation. It is another fact that 
Mr. Wilson in the House claimed that the Act as originally proposed would not affect school 
segregation; and it was at that point that Mr. Bingham disputed his construction 
of the Act and asserted that the bill was as broad as the conservatives charged 
and that, while he favored such sweeping objections, he felt that they could not 
be legally justified except by a new constitutional amendment. </p>
<p>Consequently, when the 39th Congress eliminated the no-discrimination clause and restricted the scope of the Act, they did so both on the basis of 
Mr. Bingham&#39;s construction of the breadth of the Act and his assertion that there 
would be forthcoming a constitutional amendment of broad scope. It is very evident that House 
Resolution 127, which finally became section 1 of the Fourteenth 
Amendment, with the addition of the citizenship clause, was even broader than H. 
R. 63, which was before Congress at that time. </p>
<p>Now, I should like to point out that during the debates on the proposed Amendment, 
it was charged that the Radical Republicans were simply undertaking to provide a constitutional basis for the Civil Rights 
Act which had already been enacted. At this point the proponents of the Amendment 
made their purpose clear. They pointed out that they intended not to adopt a constitutional 
amendment of restrictive scope, but first they wanted to place the rights to be secured 
by the constitutional amendment beyond the power of repeal by future congresses. 
A congressional act would not do this, but a constitutional amendment would. </p>
<p>They also made it plain that what they wanted to assure was the constitutionality 
in the future of any subsequent legislation which would have as broad a scope as 
did the &#39;66 Act at the time it was originally introduced. And they also made it 
plain that they intended to enable the Judiciary to give full and complete protection
to the rights secured. 
</p>
<p>We don&#39;t find in the debates, nor do we find elsewhere, any such limiting scope 
attributable to the Fourteenth Amendment as is claimed. As I have had occasion to 
say, Senator Howard in the Senate and Mr. Stevens in the House, introducing the 
bill for the Joint Committee on Reconstruction—I am speaking about 127 now, the 
Fourteenth Amendment—gave it a scope which far exceeded the Civil Rights Act of 1866. </p>
<p>I should also like to make this final point; that in adopting the Civil Rights 
Act of 1866, Congress enumerated in its final form as it was enacted, enumerated 
the rights protected. I have already explained the reasons why that was done. But 
unrestricted by this consideration in drafting a constitutional provision, Congress
used broad, comprehensive language to describe the standards necessary to guarantee complete Federal protection. 
</p>
<p>In one of the very early cases construing the Fourteenth Amendment, Strauder 
v. West Virginia, this Court had occasion to point that out. It said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Fourteenth Amendment makes no effort to enumerate the rights it designs to 
protect. It speaks in general terms, and those are as comprehensive as possible.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will make brief reference to the legislation following the proposal of the 
Fourteenth Amendment by Congress and, indeed, following its ratification by the 
states. We have set forth in our brief in considerable detail the proceedings in 
Congress relating specifically to school segregation. By reason of the division 
of time which we desire in undertaking to present the argument in these two cases, 
time simply will not permit me to get into it. I would like to point out, however, 
that from beginning to end, all the way through, considering the evidence overall, 
there was an overwhelming mass of opinion that under the Fourteenth Amendment
Congress could constitutionally legislate with respect to the elimination of 
segregation in public education. 
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Do you think that legislation by Congress would add anything 
to the strength of your position? </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: Insofar as this— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Insofar as segregation is concerned in the schools. </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: Oh, yes, I think if we had a congressional act, sir, that we probably 
would not have to be here now. However, l do not think that legislation by Congress 
in anywise detracts from the power of the Judiciary to enforce the prohibitions 
of the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: The provision granting new legislative power to Congress is 
useless? </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: Well, I would put it this way. As I understand section 5, section 
5 was designed to give Congress the authority to legislate in this area if it so 
desired, within the scope of its legislative sphere. I am speaking, of course, about the limitations of section 1. However, the separation of the provisions of section 1 and 5 we think is very, 
very significant. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Was 5 intended only for punishment of violations? </p>
<p><b>MR. ROBINSON</b>: For remedies, for remedies insofar as congressional action could afford them with respect to the prohibitions of section 1. But actually, 
as a matter of history, Mr. Justice Reed, the change was made from the original 
form of the Fourteenth Amendment as it was set up in H. R. 63 and H. R. 127 to make 
this a direct prohibition on the states not necessitating any congressional action, and as a matter of fact, of course, thereby empowering the courts to determine as a judicial matter acts of a state which were claimed 
to be in contravention thereof. </p>
<p>I should like to make brief reference to the evidence with respect to state ratification. We have again in our briefs set this forth in considerable 
detail. </p>
<p>I think the states will pretty largely fall in these general classifications.
First we have the states which had seceded from the Union and which were seeking readmission. We had ten in 
this class who were not in the Union at the time the Fourteenth—well, the ten southern 
states which had seceded, except Tennesee. I think for all practical purposes Tennesee 
can be classified in about the same fashion. 
</p>
<p>Our position in that regard simply is that, in view of the fact that these states 
were specifically required to adopt new constitutions in all respects in conformity with the provisions of the Federal Constitution, in view of the highly significant fact that at the time these states 
came back into the Union they contained in their constitutions no reference to race, 
no reference to school legislation—I mean to racial segregation in schools—in view of the fact that these restrictions 
appear in the laws of those states only at a later time, that under these circumstances, 
that fact is of great significance insofar as a determination as to what their understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment was to serve. </p>
<p>Additionally, the point which I urge in that connection was the fact that they 
were required to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment as a condition of readmission. Also, the newly admitted state, Nebraska, which 
came in at this time-the history which we set forth in our brief, I think, is sufficient 
to demonstrate that Nebraska&#39;s understanding with respect to the meaning of the 
Fourteenth Amendment was that it was not of a character which would permit of public school 
segregation. </p>
<p>Now, the rest of the cases fall in different categories. We have cases in which 
there were segregation laws at the time the Amendment was adopted. When the Amendment 
was adopted, those laws were eliminated, more or less at longer or shorter intervals
after the adoption of this Amendment. We think that the action of the states in this connection is of great significance. There were also states 
in which segregation in public schools was practiced administratively, some instances in which it was practiced without any statutory 
authority at all; and we have pointed out, in our effort to respond to the Court&#39;s 
question in this particular regard, the fact that in a good many instances those states changed their laws as well. 
Time will simply not permit me to go down the list with respect to the others, but 
I want to emphasize this point. 
</p>
<p>We do not claim that every state in the Union understood the Fourteenth Amendment 
as abolishing school segregation. But we do submit that, considering the evidence 
overall, there was substantial understanding which is to be derived principally not from what the states said, 
because you can&#39;t get that, but from what the states did, that the Fourteenth Amendment 
would have the scope that we attribute to it, and that consequently school segregation 
laws would be invalidated. </p>
<p>In conclusion, with respect to this historical evidence, I would like to say 
this: I think it is very clear that the framers intended to destroy the Black Codes. 
I think it is clear that they intended to deprive the states of all power to enact 
similar laws in the future. I think the evidence overall is clear that it was contemplated 
and understood that the state would not be permitted to use its power to maintain 
a class or caste system based upon race or color, and that the Fourteenth Amendment 
would operate as a prohibition against the imposition of any racial classification 
in respect of civil rights. </p>
<p>I think, secondly, it is very clear that the breadth of the Amendment is such 
that it necessarily encompasses school segregation; consequently, it is one of the activities which the Amendment was designed to protect. Necessarily, it would be invalidated by its provisions.
</p>
<p>I further submit that the overall evidence establishes substantial understanding by the states ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment that it would prohibit such segregation. The historical evidence in our opinion also demonstrates-well, there isn&#39;t any question about this-that 
under section 5 Congress could abolish such segregation and that the Judiciary in 
the enforcement of the provisions of section 1, in the light of future conditions, 
could construe the Amendment as abolishing segregation of its own force. </p>
<p>[A short recess was taken.] </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Mr. Marshall? </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OF THURGOOD MARSHALL, ESQ., <br />
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>Mr. Robinson has addressed himself particularly to the congressional history and specifically to the first two questions asked by the Court. I would 
like for a moment to review particularly questions two and three. </p>
<p>As I understand it, the second question raised the question about Congress in 
submitting the Amendment as to whether future congresses would have the power; and (b) was as to whether or not it was within 
the judicial power in the light of future conditions to construe the Amendment as abolishing such segregation of its own force; and 
then we get to question three, which is the one I would like to address myself to 
for the first part of this argument, namely, that, as I understand it, the Court is first requesting us to make the assumption that the answers to questions two (a) and two (b) do 
not dispose of the case, and on this assumption we are requested to direct our attention to the specific 
question as to whether or not the Court—this Court—has judicial 
power in construing the Fourteenth Amendment to abolish segregation in the public schools. And our answer to that question is a flat &quot;yes.&quot; </p>
<p>But in answering the question we want to develop from the legal precedents in this case the necessary answer, and to us these legal precedents divide themselves into three groups; and it would be normal and, perhaps, 
would be more logical to cover these groups of cases in chronological order. But, 
however, with the permission of the Court and for the purpose of this argument, 
we would like to divide them as follows: in the first group to discuss the cases 
this Court has handed down in the recent years construing the Fourteenth Amendment 
and the Fifth Amendment, in both instances in regard to the power of the Government, Federal or state, to use race, class 
or national origin for classification purposes. Then we would like to go to the second group, being the decisions of the Court 
construing the Fourteenth Amendment during the period immediately subsequent to the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
We believe that a review of these two groups of cases will show that during these 
two periods this Court uniformly gave to the Amendment the broad scope which the 
framers intended, as set forth by Mr. Robinson. </p>
<p>If there were no other cases on the point, the answer to question three would be simple. However, there is a third group of cases, including at 
least two decisions, and some others inferentially in that group, which are heavily relied upon by the appellees as compelling a 
contrary decision of this Court. These cases, obviously, are the ones alleged to support the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. </p>
<p>With. that preliminary statement, I would like to get to this first group of 
cases. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: May I suggest, I do not believe— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: I do not believe the Court was troubled about its own cases. It has done a good deal of reading of those cases. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: And the first group are all from this very Court; I was just trying 
to relate them. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Good. </p>
<p>Maybe the question was more nearly, instead of power—in the strong sense—I only 
speak for myself, not for others—it is the question of the propriety of exercising 
judicial power to reach this result, if the result would be reached, in the absence 
of any legislation. I do not think it was a question of power in the sense that our cases have dealt 
with it. It is a question— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Well, so far—if I understand you correctly, Mr. Justice Jackson, 
you mean power that would come from the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment?
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Whether the Amendment, with what light you can throw on 
it, makes it appropriate for judicial power, after all that has intervened, to exercise 
this power instead of— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Leaving it to the Congress. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: That is right. </p>
<p>I do not like to see you waste your time on a misunderstanding, because I do not think we had any doubt about our cases. Things are so often 
read— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: And the books. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Believe it or not, I have read about it. </p>
<p>I think, then, that I should change and leave out the first group, for the time 
being, and go to the other group beginning with Slaughter-House, because the reason 
I would like to discuss those—because, for example, Mr. Justice Frankfurter raised 
the question about Mr. Justice Miller in the Slaughter-House Cases, and I wanted 
to add to that the fact that we cannot ignore the opinion of Justice Strong in the 
Strauder v. West Virginia case; and at that stage of the argument I wanted to say 
that in these decisions at that period of time they recognized the exact same legislative historical argument that we have just completed; and the Slaughter-House Cases, 
as I read it, stand for the proposition—and at least it has been cited by this Court all the way up at least to the covenant 
cases of Shelley—that the Fourteenth Amendment and the intent that you get from 
the framers of it, is definitely on the broad purpose that we allege here. </p>
<p>As to whether or not Congress intended to leave this matter to Congress, I submit 
that one of the short answers is that Title 8, section 43, which is the statute 
that we base all of these cases on, says specifically in its enacting clause adopted 
in 1871, which we have in our brief, that &quot;this bill is enacted for the purpose 
of enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot; Congress has already acted and in that Act I am sure 
it will be remembered that it says that anyone acting under color of state statute, 
who denies anyone rights guaranteed by the Constitution or laws of the United States 
shall have a right of action in law or in equity. The original statute said &quot;in 
the District Court or Circuit Courts,&quot; and in codifying it they, of course, have 
left out the circuit court point. </p>
<p>But if there is a need for congressional action, it is there, 
and in Strauder against West Virginia Mr. Justice Strong in his opinion—and we quote it in our brief on page 22 and 23, the language which we believe—either 
I have the wrong brief or—it is there; 33. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: I would like to have you discuss the question of power because I believe that is the question the Court asked 
you to discuss. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: The power. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Yes, the power. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir. On the power, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, we take the position, 
and we have covered it in the brief— </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: —and that was the part that Mr. Robinson was to deal with this 
morning, and it is our understanding that the Fourteenth Amendment, following the 
Civil Rights Law, but not limited to the Civil Rights Act of 1866—in the debates 
it is obvious, especially in the later debates, that left with the courts of the land was this 
problem of deciding as to the interpretation, so that as to the power, it is our 
position that the Court gets specific power in addition to the regular judiciary act, in this Act of 1871, Title 8, which 
is not Title 8, section 43, which, I submit, not only gives the federal courts power, 
but imposes upon the federal courts a specific duty which is different; and this 
is where we get our power point, and we thought that was sufficient. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Mr. Marshall— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, Mr. Justice Frankfurter. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: —you trouble me about saying there has been legislation. 
You are not resting your claim here on the Act of 1871 and are then discussing whether 
that Act is constitutional? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: No, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: You have to—you are resting, as I understand it, on 
the compulsions, the implications, derived from the Fourteenth Amendment, as such, 
in your cases? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: So I do not know why you constantly revert to the fact 
that Congress has already exercised the power. I do not understand what you mean 
by that. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Well, as I understand, running through the questions, especially 
those in number two, the second question—and, fortunately, insofar as this case is concerned, the appellees here claim that 
Congress has no power to legislate in this field at all and, as I understand their 
position, the courts and Congress and nobody else can touch it; it is a matter solely 
for the states. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That we have not got here. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: No, sir; but it is our position that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to leave to the courts the normal construction of the 
statute—I mean of the Constitution—and this Act of 1871 is merely recognizing that.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I do not know what that Act has to do with this, our 
problem. If your claim prevails, it must prevail by virtue of what flows out of 
the Fourteenth Amendment as such. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: And would be— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: And so far as I am concerned, 1871 need not be on the 
statute books. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: And we would still have a valid— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: And does not help me any. 
</p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: All right, I understand. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: As I understand it, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, if I may for a minute 
leave the congressional debates, because I think on the matter of time—and go to 
the Strauder and the Slaughter-House Cases which, I think, are the key to this situation, because they were decided at the time nearest to the Fourteenth Amendment—and the Slaughter-House Cases, Justice Miller&#39;s opinion has been, as I said, cited over and over again; and there is no question 
that that opinion makes it clear that the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted for the express purpose, and the purpose was, to correct 
the situation theretofore existing in regard to the treatment of Negroes, slave 
or free, in a different category from the way you treated the others.

brief, it is stated that: </p>

  <p>The existence of laws in the states where the newly emancipated Negroes resided, 
which discriminated with gross injustice and hardship against them as a class, was the evil to be 
  remedied by this clause, and by it such laws are forbidden.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the expression that is nearest to the time of the Amendment. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Wouldn&#39;t you say, sir, we do not have to elaborate that 
because the whole point—not the whole point, but one of the difficulties or one 
of the assumptions that has to be remedied by later cases—was the intimation of 
Justice Miller that it was related exclusively to equalizing things? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: So one does not have to argue that the Fourteenth Amendment, 
the target of the Fourteenth Amendment, was to give Negroes certain rights. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: I think so, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I do not see that that needs any argument. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: The only thing that was preliminary to this, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, 
was that in the Strauder case—and I think that is the one that is really on the 
point for this particular issue—in Strauder v. West Virginia, it was made clear, 
one thing which I would have considered obvious all along, and that is, the constitutional 
amendments are setting down rules—I mean broad principles and not rules—of conduct, 
as such, and they are put in broad language. Well, Strauder mentions that. </p>
<p>But the important point is that in the Strauder case the decision in that Court makes it clear that they did not intend to enumerate these rights; and that, to my mind, is the crux of whether or not the Court has 
power to deal with segregation. </p>
<p>Certainly it did not mention it in the Amendment itself, and a lot of items it 
did not mention. But when you read the debates, as Mr. Robinson explained, you cannot 
escape this point: that the Amendment was adopted for the express purpose of depriving 
the states of authority to exercise and enforce the existing Black Codes; that by 
putting it in the Constitution it was obviously intended that the states would not have power in the future to set up additional Black 
Codes; and to use the language of this Court in one case, Lane v. Wilson, whether 
it is sophisticated or simple-minded; and the part that is to my mind crucial in this case is that until this time 
the appellees have shown nothing that can in any form or fashion say that the statutes 
involved in these cases are not the same type of statutes discussed in the debates 
and in the decisions of the Court nearest to that, namely, the Black Codes; and 
I do not see how the inevitable result can be challenged, because they are of the exact same cloth, when you go to these Black Codes. They do, 
however, on the question of power, argue that the State of South Carolina and the 
State of Virginia have themselves worked out this problem, and for that reason they have found they have to have 
segregation. </p>
<p>The only way they can keep schools would be to keep segregation and for that reason, as I understand their argument, that reason takes them out 
of the general flow of invidious legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment; and 
then they say that there is no definite material in the debates that shows the intent 
of Congress to include segregation in public education. </p>
<p>We submit that that is not the way to approach this problem. Once we admit, either 
by reading the legislative debates or reading cases such as Strauder, the Slaughter-House 
Cases and the other cases, once we arrive at the conclusion that the Fourteenth 
Amendment was intended to strike down all types of class and caste legislation that on its face involves class, then it seems to me that the only way the appellees 
can destroy that very clear and logical approach is to show that it was intended not to include schools, not include segregation; 
and then we have the very interesting position —they immediately recognize that 
in their briefs, especially in the South Carolina brief, because they say that the 
McLaurin case involves &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, and certainly, if ever there 
was a case that did not involve &quot;separate but equal,&quot; it was McLaurin, because as 
soon as the McLaurin case recognizes the broad intent of the Fourteenth Amendment 
to cover in progressive stages education, graduate education—I mean, excuse me, 
legal education—then graduate education; and, as I understand the task the appellees 
have perforce addressed themselves to, it is that, even admitting that education 
is within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment, when you get to elementary and high schools this Court loses its power 
to decide as to whether or not segregation in elementary and high schools is illegal. </p>
<p>Now, as to the power argument, it seems to me that that is it in the simplest 
fashion; and despite the fact that we thought we were obliged to develop it, I think 
that is a shorthand statement of our position on it; and I think it has not been 
met, at least up to this point, in any of the briefs and cases. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I should suggest that the question is not whether this Court loses its power, but whether the states lose their 
powers. I understand the answer you make to it— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: It is my understanding, yes, sir, I think definitely, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that a reading of the two briefs in 
this case demonstrates clearly that as of this time we have 
a test to see whether or not the public policy, customs and mores of the states 
of South Carolina and Virginia or the avowed intent of our Constitution—as to which 
one will prevail. </p>
<p>For example, in their briefs they rely on the fact that, they mention the fact 
that there is such a thing as racial prejudice, and this is this and that is that; 
and I would like to, if I could, quote to you one case in our reply brief which, 
at least is, I know, not news to the Court; but it was news to us. I am sure the 
Court is familiar with the case of Tanner v. Little. I am not advocating the actual 
final decision in that case as of this time, but in the language in that case, which 
involved, as you may remember, the green stamps by trading stores—the language is 
cited on pages eight and nine of our brief, and I submit that it is in the middle 
of a paragraph—is that: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Red things may be associated by reason of their redness, with disregard of all 
other resemblances or of distinctions. Such classification would be logically appropriate. Apply it further: make a rule of conduct depend 
upon it, and distinguish in legislation between red-haired men and black-haired men, and the classification would immediately be seen to 
be wrong; it would have only arbitrary relation to the purpose and province of legislation.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these cases the only way—and if I will stay with the power point a short while 
longer, there would have to be a showing in order to sustain this legislation under 
the broad power of this Court to construe statutes under the reasonable classification 
doctrine. They would have to show, and we have shown to the contrary—they would have to show, one, that there are differences in race; and, two, that differences 
in race have a recognizable relationship to the subject matter being legislated, namely, public education. That is a rule that has been uniformly applied by this Court in all other challenges 
that a classification is unreasonable. Those cases, of course, are also set out 
in our brief. </p>
<p>The other side in the South Carolina case says that the rule is a general rule, 
and the State has these powers; and they cite, of all cases, to support that, Yick 
Wo v. Hopkins, which this Court is thoroughly familiar with, the principle established 
in that case, which is directly to the contrary. </p>
<p>So, on the power point, it seems to me that there are only two relative groups 
of arguments: one, the congressional side, and the other, in addition to the recognized 
cases, the regular reasonable classification cases. </p>
<p>Now, with that, it seems to me that if I am correct in interpreting Mr. Justice Jackson&#39;s position, that that is what that point involves, it seems 
to me that is a sufficient answer to it, and if it is, I would conclude it by going 
back to the difference between the cases and the cases on the other side, because 
I feel obliged to touch the cases that the other side, of course, relies on and 
the lower court relied on, beginning with the Plessy v. Ferguson case, and its doctrine.
</p>
<p>In our brief we have pointed out the obvious ways that those cases could be distinguished. 
For the purpose of this argument and for the purpose of answering the specific question 
of this Court, we believe that it is proper for us to say here and now that the 
distinction, for example, in the Plessy v. Ferguson case, that it involved railroads 
instead of education, transportation against education, is a point of distinction; 
but for this point there is none, in fact, because it has been recognized as the 
originator of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. </p>
<p>The next case that is near to the point is the Gong Lum v. Rice case, which was 
different; they did not raise the issue of the validity of the classification. All 
they were objecting to—and possibly it is understandable that the Chinese child was objecting to being classified 
as a Negro and put in an inferior school. Maybe that is, but so far as the law in 
the country today is concerned, that decision stands for the proposition that a 
state has a right to classify on the basis of class, race or ancestry; and our position 
on that is merely that the Gong Lum case and the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine of 
Plessy v. Ferguson is just out of step with the earlier decisions in Slaughter-House 
and Strauder v. West Virginia and the recent cases in this Court. </p>
<p>The other point which is made— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: But to reach that you have to take the Sweatt case based on 
the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: No, sir; I only say the McLaurin case does not embrace the &quot;separate 
but equal&quot; doctrine. I think in Sweatt v. Painter, the truth of the matter is that 
the decision was able to find that these intangibles produced inequality, and to 
that extent— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: But didn&#39;t the McLaurin case— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: There was none of that. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Granting the facts in the statement showed that they were equal—
</p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: But didn&#39;t the fact that they did not 
have the opportunity for association or discussion have any effect on it? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: And that, therefore, since they were graduate students, they did not have equal opportunities. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: As I read it, sir—the best I could do is read it—as I understand 
it, the conclusion in there in two particular places, he says that in a situation 
of this type the state is deprived of the power to make distinctions; and the other 
point, it says, to make any difference in treatment—but it was my idea that the 
thrust of the McLaurin opinion is that segregation in and of itself, at least as 
far as graduate training is concerned, is invalid, and that it was that conclusion 
was reached by first finding out— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: But they gave the reasons why, for undergraduate students, because they did not give equal opportunity. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: But the only reason, I submit, Mr. Justice Reed, on the McLaurin 
case and these cases is age, age of students, and the fact that obviously graduate training is different from elementary training 
and high school training. But it has a difference, to use the language about another 
point in the McLaurin case, there is constitutional difference, or rather it is insignificant as to the minor points, because if I understand, if we follow that to the logical 
conclusion, I do not have the slightest idea of where the line would be; whether 
the line would be at the college level, the junior college level, or the high school 
level, as to where this discussion with other pupils is of benefit. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Am I wrong in thinking that you must reject the basis 
of the decision in McLaurin for purposes of this case? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: You mean reject the basis of the fact that they were not allowed 
to associate? </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: No. The basis was the criterion of those cases, was 
whether each got the same thing. Your position in these cases is that that is not arguable, that you cannot differentiate,
you cannot enter the domain of whether a black child or a white child gets the 
same educational advantages or facilities or opportunity. You must reject that, 
do you not? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: We reach— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Therefore, that is what I mean by saying you must reject 
the basis on which those cases went. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: We reject it to this extent: I think I am— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: You reject the Delaware ground of decision, don&#39;t you?
</p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Absolutely. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Well, therefore, you reject the basis of the McLaurin 
case. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: I think so far as our argument on the constitutional debates is concerned, and these two cases, that the state is deprived of any 
power to make any racial classification in an governmental field. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: So I understand. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: But I do have to qualify it to this extent: I can conceive of some 
governmental action—to be perfectly frank, sir, we have discussed the point of census-taking—so 
they could take the census and name in the census, but so long as it affects not 
either group—but in any area where it touches the individuals concerned in any form or fashion, it is clear to me, to my mind, under the Fourteenth Amendment, that you cannot separate people or denote that one 
shall go here and one shall go there if the facilities are absolutely equal; that is the issue in this case, because in the South Carolina 
case especially it is admitted on record that every other thing about the schools 
is equal, schools, curricula, everything else. It is only the question as to the 
power of the State to— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Well, the Delaware case tests that. You are opposed 
to—you are in favor of the requested equality there, because I do not know whether you are— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is generally under your wing? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: It is not only under our wing, sir; we are very proud of the fact 
that the children are going to school there, and they are demonstrating that it 
can be done. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: All I am saying is that, with reference to the basis 
on which the Delaware decision went, you reject— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I follow that. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Well, it seems to me, sir, that there is 
considerable—there is an opening for argument that, after all, the Court is interpreting the phrase 
&quot;equal protection&quot; underlining the word &quot;equal,&quot; and for that reason, that is the 
reason in our record in the case we felt obliged to show that these, what we consider 
as intangibles in the Sweatt case, were there in this case, and, if necessary, the doctrine of Sweatt and McLaurin could automatically on all fours come there 
except for the question of difference of schools. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: But the point is important whether we are to decide 
that the facilities are equal or whether one says that is an irrelevant question, 
because you cannot apply that test between white and black. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: In this case it is irrelevant— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: All right. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: —for two reasons: one, it is not in the case because we have agreed 
that equality is outside the case, and our argument is deliberately broad enough 
to encompass a situation regardless of facilities, and we make no issue about it.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I understand that; but that will be a ground on which 
the series of cases in the McLaurin case—the point of my question is that I think we are dealing with two different legal 
propositions; McLaurin is one and what you are tendering to the Court is another.
</p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: The questions raised by this Court in June, as we understand it, 
requested us to find out as to whether or not class legislation and, specifically 
segregation, whether or not it, in and of itself, with nothing else, violated the 
Fourteenth Amendment. We have addressed ourselves to that in this brief, and we are convinced that 
the answer is that any segregation which is for the purpose of setting up either 
class or caste legislation is in and of itself a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, 
with the only proviso that normally, in normal judicial proceedings, there must 
be a showing of injury or what have you. That is our position and that is up—
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: That is solely on the equal protection clause? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Solely on the equal protection clause, except, sir, that is true 
in South Carolina, but we are arguing two cases together. In Virginia we rely on 
equal protection and due process both, but the argument in our brief is limited 
to equal protection; not that we have discarded due process, but we did not have 
to get to it because of the wording of the questions of the Court. But we think it is 
a denial of both. </p>
<p>I urge particularly the equal protection clause because it seems to me, at least 
from the restrictive covenant case, the Shelley case on that—these rights are beginning 
to fall into the equal protection clause rather than the due process clause, but we do not abandon the due process clause at all. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: In the District of Columbia case— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Automatically— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: —the opposite would happen. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: In the District of Columbia case—we are not the lawyers in that 
case—we are all working together on it—they, of course, are relying on the due process 
clause and they have the cases that support that; so I would say that insofar as 
there is a due process argument to be in the District of Columbia and Virginia,
they would be related, except for the difference that in the District of Columbia 
this Court has broad power— 
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Your argument comes down to this: If in one of the states 
in which there is a large percentage of Negro voters, a preponderance, where we 
get a situation where x state has a preponderance of Negro voters who are actually 
going to the polls, and actually assert their preponderance and install a Negro 
governor, to the extent that more money is spent for Negro education, better housing, 
better schools, more highly paid teachers, where teachers are more attracted, better maps, better school-books, better everything than the white children enjoy—and I know I am making a fantastic, 
if you will, assumption— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: —and yet there is segregation, you would come here and 
say that they cannot do that? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: If it is done by the state, the state has been deprived of— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is your position; that is the legal— </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: I think, sir, that is our flat legal position, that if it involves 
class or caste legislation— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is the antithesis of the McLaurin and the Gaines doctrine. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Well, of the Gaines case, certainly so, sir, 
because I, for one, do not believe that the language used by Chief Justice Hughes was—I 
mean, I just do not consider it as dictum when he said that they operated under 
a doctrine the validity of which had been supported. </p>
<p>I think that Gaines was interpreted within the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. 
I think Sipuel was, with the addition of &quot;you have to do it now.&quot; I think that Sweatt 
and McLaurin, if I could disagree for a moment, are moving between the two; that 
is the way I look at it. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: My only purpose is to try to see these things clearly 
without a simplifying darkness, and to try to see it clearly. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir. But I do not believe—the point I wanted to make clear 
is that we do not have to, the Court does not have to take my position to decide 
this case. Because of what I told you a minute ago, they could take up that material 
in those other records and find that the children were not getting an equal education, 
but it would not help in the situation. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: No, but if that line is taken, then the whole problem 
that you bring your weight to bear on is opened, and in each case. we have to decide 
that. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: I think so, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I did not suppose that you would say that we had to 
open this case, that they were not equal, whether psychologically, whether buildings, 
whether they spent x million dollars for white, or x minus y for the black; that 
does not open any doctrine? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: No, sir; and the Delaware case, if I can go to that without going 
outside of the record, demonstrates a situation more so than it does in South Carolina, 
because in Delaware so long as the schools are unequal, okay. And then the schools 
are made equal, and if I understand the procedure, you move the Negroes back to the colored school; and then the next year you put ten more books in 
the white school, and the colored school is unequal; and I do not see how that point would ever be adequately decided, and in truth 
and in fact, there are no two equal schools, because there are no two equal faculties 
in the world in any schools. They are good as individuals, and one is better than 
the other; but to just—that is the trouble with the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot;; 
the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot; assumes that two things can be equal. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: There is not absolute equality, but substantially equal, in accordance with the terms of our cases. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir; starting with Plessy the word &quot;substantial,&quot; and we say in our brief—I mean we are absolutely serious about it—that the use of the word &quot;substantial&quot; emphasizes that those cases in truth and in 
fact amend the Fourteenth Amendment by saying that equal protection can be obtained in a substantially equal fashion, and there is nothing in the debates that will hint in the slightest 
that they did not mean complete equality—they said so—to raise the Negro up into the status of complete equality with the other 
people. That is the language they used. &quot;Substantial&quot; is a word that was put into 
the Fourteenth Amendment by Plessy v. Ferguson, and I cannot find it, and it cannot be found in any place 
in the debates. </p>
<p>If it please the Court, we would like to, if possible, conserve the balance of 
the time for rebuttal. Mr. Robinson was a little over his time, and I cut mine down. 
Unless there are any questions on this particular point, because we still have some 
time left, I would like to leave that for rebuttal. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Thank you. Mr. Davis? </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. DAVIS, ESQ., <br />
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES R. W. ELLIOTT ET AL. </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. DAVIS</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>I suppose there are few invitations less welcome in an advocate&#39;s life than to be asked to reargue a case on which he has once spent himself, and 
that is particularly unwelcome when an order for reargument gives him no indication 
whatever of the subjects in which the Court may be interested, and, therefore, I 
want to at the outset tender the Court my thanks and, I think, the thanks of my 
colleagues on both sides of the desk, for the guidance they have given us by the 
series of questions which they asked us to devote our attention to, and in what 
I shall have to say, I hope to indicate the answers which, for our part, we give 
to each one of them. </p>
<p>At the previous hearing of this case, I think all counsel on both sides of the 
controversy, and in every case, realizing that it was an act of mercy and, perhaps, 
even of piety, not to increase the reading matter that comes to this Court, briefed 
the case in rather concise fashion. An effort was apparent, and I am sure I shared 
it, to condense the controversy to the smallest compass it would bear. Now, for 
a rough guess I should think the motion for reargument has contributed somewhere 
between 1500 and 2000 pages to the possible entertainment, if not the illumination, 
of the Court. But I trust the Court will not hold counsel responsible for that proliferation.
</p>
<p>Most of us have supported our answers to the Court&#39;s questions by 
appendices addressed to the action of Congress, to the action of the ratifying 
states, and in our particular case, to the history of the controversy within the 
State of South Carolina. </p>
<p>In view of the fact that His Honor, the Chief Justice, was not on the bench at 
the time of the other argument, perhaps I should outline the present posture of 
the South Carolina case of Briggs and Elliott. It was brought, as Mr. Robinson correctly 
stated, upon two grounds: A suit by infant Negro children in Clarendon County School District 
No. 22 which, by a subsequent reorganization, became a part of District No. 1, by their parents and next friends, asserting 
that they were denied the equal protection of the laws on two grounds: first, that 
section 7 of Article 11 of the Constitution of South Carolina forbade integrated schools, commanded that the white and colored races should be taught in separate schools; and that 
the statute, in pursuance of that Constitution, section 5277 of their Code, made 
a similar provision; and that both were in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States per se. Second, that be that as it may, inequalities existed 
between the educational facilities furnished to the white and black children, to the detriment of the black. </p>
<p>The State of South Carolina came in and admitted that those inequalities existed 
and declared its intention to remove them as promptly as possible. </p>
<p>Evidence was taken; the district court decreed that the Constitution and statute of South Carolina did not violate the Amendment; found the existence of the admitted inequality, and enjoined its immediate removal, 
gave to the State of South Carolina the period of six months to report what steps 
had been taken to implement that decree. </p>
<p>At the end of that time a report came in which came to this Court, and was 
returned to the district court, and upon a second hearing, a further report came 
in. It was made to appear that the promise of the State of South Carolina to 
remove this inequality was no empty promise; that it had authorized, its 
legislature had authorized, a bond issue of 75 million dollars to equalize the 
physical facilities of the schools, supported by a three percent sales tax; that the curricula 
had been equalized, the pay of teachers had been equalized, transportation had been 
provided for children, white and black; and the accuracy of those reports being 
admitted—and I am merely summarizing it—the court below held that it was clear 
that by the first of September, 1952, that the inequalities had disappeared. It 
then entered an order enjoining the further removal of such inequalities as 
might have existed, and declared the Constitution and the statute to be valid 
and nonviolative of the 
Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p>We have, then, in South Carolina a case, as Mr. Marshall has so positively admitted, 
with no remaining question of inequality at all, and the naked question is whether 
a separation of the races in the primary and secondary schools, which are the subject 
of this particular case, is of itself per se a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
</p>
<p>Now, turning to our answers, let me state what we say to each one of them, The 
first question was: What evidence is there that the Congress which submitted to 
the state legislatures and conventions which ratified the Fourteenth Amendment contemplated
or did not contemplate, understood or did not understand that it would abolish 
segregation in public schools? 
</p>
<p><b>We answer</b>: The overwhelming preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that the 
Congress which submitted, and the state legislatures which ratified, the Fourteenth 
Amendment did not contemplate and did not understand that it would abolish segregation
in public schools; and in the time that is afforded I hope to vindicate that 
categorical reply. 
</p>
<p>Our friends the appellants take an entirely contrary view, and they take it, 
in part, on the same historical testimony; certain fallacies underlie, I think, their course in reaching that conclusion. Some of them are 
apparent in their brief, and I have not found that they touch upon them in oral 
argument. </p>
<p>The first fallacy which appears in their brief, in their recounting of history, is the assumption, wholly unwarranted, as I think, that the antislavery 
pre-Civil War crusade, the abolitionist crusade, was directed not only against slavery but against segregation in schools. I do 
not think that thesis can be sustained, for the thrust and movement of the abolitionist 
crusade was directed toward one thing and one thing only: the abolition of the institution of slavery, and 
from that nothing can be deduced which is helpful to the Court in its study of this 
section of history. </p>
<p>I think the next unjustified assumption which—again, I am referring to my adversaries&#39; 
brief and not to their oral presentation—was that the Radical Republicans controlled the action of the 39th Congress. That 
again is an unwarranted assumption. The 39th Congress never went as far as some 
of the Radical Republicans wished it to go, and perhaps there has never been a Congress in which the debates 
furnished less real pablum on which history might feed. It was what Claude Bowers 
calls in his book <i>The Tragic Era</i>, well-named—flames of partisan passion were still burning 
over the ashes of the Civil War. </p>
<p>In the Senate there were such men as Sumner, who made a lifelong crusade in favor 
of mixed racial schools from the time that he was counsel for the plaintiff in Roberts 
v. Boston in &#39;49—he never missed an opportunity to bring the question forward, and never succeeded 
in having it enacted into law, except by the legislature of Massachusetts in 1855. 
There were men who stood with Sumner, his colleague Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, 
and on the other side, equally critical, men like Cowan of Pennsylvania and Garrett Davis of Kentucky, and others, resented all of the Civil War Reconstruction 
legislation, and whenever they had an opportunity to attack it, painted it in the 
blackest colors that they could devise. </p>
<p>In the House, Thaddeus Stevens, called by historians perhaps the most unlovely 
character in American history, more concerned to humiliate the aristocrats of the 
South, as he called them, even than to preserve the rights of the Negro. His policy 
was confiscation of all estates over 10,000 dollars and 200 acres, of which forty dollars should 
be given to every adult Negro, and the remainder should be sold to pay the expenses of the war. He wanted the South to come to 
Washington as suppliants in sackcloth and ashes. He had his echoes. </p>
<p>On the other side there were resisters like Rogers of New Jersey, a Democrat from New Jersey, who never missed an opportunity to criticize every one of the bills that were presented on the ground that they 
would forbid segregated schools. That echo came from Rogers almost as regularly 
as the contrary view came from Sumner. </p>
<p>Now, if I gather my friends&#39; position both in brief and argument, they hope from the debates of such a Congress to distill clear, specific evidence 
of congressional intent. I do not think that is possible; but there is a source 
from which congressional intent can be gathered, far more reliable, far less hope 
for challenge by anyone: What did the Congress do? And when we study the legislation
enacted by Congress immediately before, immediately after, and during the period 
of the discussion of the Fourteenth Amendment, there can be no question left that Congress did not intend by the Fourteenth 
Amendment to deal with the question of mixed or segregated schools. </p>
<p>There is another fallacy in the presentation of the case by the appellants. They 
take for granted they can quote any senator, congressman, or other character in favor of racial equality, they can count him down in the 
column of those who were opposed to segregated schools, which is a clear non sequitur and a begging of the question. </p>
<p>We are not concerned here with the mandate of the Constitution that the Negro, as well as the white, shall enjoy the equal protection of the laws. The question with which Your Honors are confronted is: Is segregation 
in schools a denial of equality where the segregation runs against one race as well 
as against the other, and where, in the eye of the law, no difference between the 
educational facilities of the two classes can be discerned? </p>
<p>Now, I think those remarks sum up most of what I care to say by way of direct 
reply to the argument of the appellants. </p>
<p>There is a third point of view presented to Your Honors. We say the intent of 
Congress was clear not to enter this field. We say the intent of the ratifying states 
was equally clear, the majority of them, not to enter this field. The Attorney General 
is present, acceding to the invitation of the Court, with a brief and a very large appendix reciting 
the history of the legislation. He reaches the conclusion, or those who speak for 
him—I am not speaking in the personal sense, but only of the office—he reaches the 
conclusion, as stated in his brief, historical facts, after some 400 pages of recital,
are too equivocal and inconclusive—I am having some trouble with my own chirography 
here—the historical facts are too equivocal and inconclusive to formulate a solid basis on which this Court can determine 
the application of the Amendment to the question of school segregation as it exists 
today. </p>
<p>After so prolonged a study as has evidently been made, it does seem rather a 
lame and impotent conclusion, not calculated to be a great deal of help to the Court; 
and I think the cause of that despair on the part of the learned Attorney General 
and his aides is that they have fallen into the same fallacy into which the appellants 
have fallen. They endeavor by collating all that was said on either side whenever 
the question raged, and it was not a single instance—they hope out of that to distill 
some attar that will exhibit what can fairly be called the congressional intent. 
It is no wonder that, having plunged into that Serbonian bog, they are in a state 
of more or less despair when they are able to emerge. </p>
<p>Now, Your Honors then are presented with this: We say there is no warrant for 
the assertion that the Fourteenth Amendment dealt with the school question. The 
appellants say that from the debates in Congress it is perfectly evident that the 
Congress wanted to deal with the school question; and the Attorney General, as a friend of the 
Court, says he does not know which is correct. So Your Honors are afforded the reasonable 
field for selection. </p>
<p>[Laughter.] </p>
<p>Now, we say that, whatever may have been said in debate—and there is not an angle of this case that would not find, 
if that were the decisive question, support in what some person might have said 
at some time—but Congress by its action demonstrated beyond a peradventure what 
scope it intended to employ. </p>
<p>I hoped at one time that it would be possible to take up each action of Congress 
upon which we rely and vindicate our interpretation of it. I see now that I underestimated the time that would be at my disposal, 
or overestimated my power of delivery. I shall have to speak now more or less in 
word of catalogue and leave to our brief and to our appendices confirmation of the 
relevancy of these incidents. </p>
<p>In the 39th Congress the first supplemental Freedmen&#39;s Bureau bill passed, giving the Freedmen&#39;s Bureau power to buy sites and buildings and 
schools for freedmen, refugees and their children; and, of course, the freedmen and the refugees were of the colored race. There 
was provision that if certain catalogued rights were denied, military protection 
should be given. What was that catalogue? To make and enforce contracts, sue, be 
sued, be a party and give evidence, inherit, purchase or dispose of real or personal property, have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and estate, and be subject to like punishments, pains 
and penalties as with others, and none beside. </p>
<p>What did the Freedmen&#39;s Bureau do? It was the pet and child of Congress and, 
acting under its constant supervision, they installed separate schools throughout the South, so separate indeed that history records 
one complaint by the City of Charleston that they had seized, occupied, and taken 
over all the school buildings in the city, filled them with their Negro wards, and 
the white children no longer had any buildings to which to resort. </p>
<p>The Civil Rights Act of 1866, where the rights to be protected by it were catalogued 
almost in the identical language of the Freedmen&#39;s Bureau Bill, the difference being that the Freedmen&#39;s Bureau Bill ran only in those states in which the process of the courts had been interrupted, 
which was a euphemism, being those states that had been occupied by the Confederate 
and Federal Army, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was designed to be nationwide—it
is not surprising that its language conformed to the language of the Freedmen&#39;s 
Bureau. They were both introduced at the same time by Senator Trumbull, the Chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, and they made their way through Congress in much the same fashion.
</p>
<p>After the Civil Rights Act of 1866 had passed the Senate, it went to the House 
for consideration. There it was introduced, sponsored, discussed by Congressman 
James Wilson of Iowa, who was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and when brother 
Rogers, with his usual complaint that it would do away with the separate schools—and 
others joined him in taking that point of view—at that time Wilson said on the floor 
that the Act did not mean that their children should attend the same school, and, 
in effect, that it was absurd so to interpret it. </p>
<p>Now, the pertinency of that is due to the connection which counsel has stated 
between the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment. It was the constant claim 
of those who favored the Fourteenth Amendment, Stevens and Sumner, both speaking 
to it, that it was intended to make the Civil Rights Act not only constitutional and quiet Bingham&#39;s doubt and conscience, but to make it irrepealable so that, 
as Stevens said, whenever the Democrats and their Copperhead allies came back to 
Congress, they would not be able to repeal it.
</p>
<p>I will pass over for the moment some other legislation, which I will come back 
to, that occurred in the 39th Congress. </p>
<p>We came to the reinstatement of the seceded states. Congress passed an Act by 
virtue of which they might, in compliance, send their senators and congressmen back. 
Now, in the 39th Congress, Sumner had put forward his prescription for their readmission. 
He had five headings for it, of which the fourth was this: that the seceding states, 
if they wished to return, should adopt constitutions which, among other things, would provide for the organization of an educational system for the equal benefit of all, without distinction of 
color or race. </p>
<p>The Reconstruction Act was adopted in the succeeding Congress and it called for a catalogue of performances to be carried out by the states 
desiring readmission. Did they say anything about Sumner&#39;s educational plank? Not 
a word. Was any requirement made of the state as to educational provision? None 
whatever. </p>
<p>When they came to admit the State of Arkansas, Senator Drake of Missouri offered 
an amendment in which he provided that the constitution of the petitioning state 
should provide no denial of the elective franchise or any other right. He offered that as an amendment 
to the bill admitting the State of Arkansas. Controversy arose as to the meaning of &quot;any other right.&quot; Then it was asserted that there 
would enter the question of schools. It was stricken out, and the Drake Amendment 
adopted without—and Senator Frelinghuysen, who had been Chairman of the Joint Committee
on Reconstruction, said that neither the Drake Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment 
touched the question of separate schools. That is once I think it is proper to quote 
from a debate. </p>
<p>There came then the amnesty bill amendments. Congress passed an amnesty bill. When it was before the Senate, 
Sumner offered his supplemental Civil Rights Act, which provided expressly for mixed schools. The Judiciary Committee twice reported it adversely, and Sumner flanked them by offering it then as an amendment to 
the amnesty bill. In that form it was debated and, finally, a vote was taken which 
was 28 to 28, and the Vice President broke the tie in Sumner&#39;s favor. It was the high-water mark of his achievement.
</p>
<p>The amnesty bill, so amended, went to the House. It failed of passage in the 
Senate, where it needed a two-thirds vote under the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
It failed of passage in the Senate and the Senate did nothing more with it. Then 
it went to the House, and the House failed to pass it. The weight of the Sumner
Amendment was too much for the bill to carry. 
</p>
<p>Bills to require mixed schools in the District of Columbia were defeated in the 
41st and the 42nd Congress. </p>
<p>Then came the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which was passed only after the Kellogg 
Amendment striking out the reference to schools, churches, cemeteries, and juries, 
and passed in that form. </p>
<p>Then in 1862 Congress set up its first school for Negroes in the District on 
a segregated basis. In 1864 it dealt with that question again on a segregated basis. </p>
<p>In 1866, the 39th Congress, it passed a donation of certain lots to be given 
to schools for Negroes only. It passed a second Act in the same Congress dealing 
with the distribution of funds between the Negro and the white schools. In 1868 
it dealt with the question again on the segregated basis, and has so continued to 
this day. </p>
<p>I know that Your Honors are shortly going to hear a case which challenges the 
validity of those statutes; and be they valid or invalid, for the purposes of my 
present argument it is immaterial. They are enough to show what the sentiment of Congress was, what its determination 
was on this specific question; and it is no answer to say that Congress is not controlled 
by the Fourteenth Amendment. Of course it is not; but is it conceivable to any man 
that Congress should submit to the states an amendment destroying their right to segregated schools and should contemporaneously and continuously institute a regime of segregated schools in the District of 
Columbia? I should think that if a congressman who was responsible for submitting 
to the state an amendment shearing them of power-he would have quite an explanation to make if he got home, if he 
said he had not done exactly the reverse in the District of Columbia. </p>
<p>Then it is suggested in the brief for the learned Attorney General—and I think similar comment, perhaps, by the appellants—that 
these two instances in the 39th Congress, these two legislative recognitions of 
separate schools in the District, which was taking place when the Fourteenth 
Amendment was taking form and substance—they say that those were mere routine performances, that they came 
very late in the congressional session, that they were not even honored by having 
any debate. Apparently, to have law which is really to be recognized as a congressional deliverance, it must 
come early in the session, it must be debated, and the mere fact that it is passed 
by unanimous consent and without objection more or less disparages its importance 
as an historical incident. I have never, that I can recall, heard a similar yardstick 
applied to congressional action. </p>
<p>There isn&#39;t time to go over the states. They are covered by our appendix and 
these other appendices. We classified them, too. We say that there are nine states 
that never had segregated schools. There were those states in the northern territory, 
and there weren&#39;t enough Negroes to make it worthwhile. There were five states—I 
am speaking now of the ratifying states, not of the ratifying—of the 37 states that 
were then in existence, there were about five states where there had been segregation, 
and they contemporaneously discontinued. Those were Connecticut, Louisiana, Michigan, Florida and South Carolina. Three of those states returned to segregation as 
soon as the Reconstruction period was over. </p>
<p>There were four states that had segregation—I am speaking of the period now from 
&#39;66 when the Amendment was submitted to &#39;68 when it was proclaimed—there were four 
states with segregation who refused to ratify and continued segregation. They were California, Kentucky, 
Maryland and Delaware. Delaware didn&#39;t ratify until 1901. </p>
<p>There were two border states that had segregation both before and after ratification, and have continued it to this day. They are Missouri 
and West Virginia. </p>
<p><b>There were nine northern states that either continued segregation they already had or established it immediately after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment</b>: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>And then—and I can find no evidence that my friends appreciate the significance of this fact—of the reconstructed states who ratified in order to get their delegate, their congressmen and senators back to Washington, eight Reconstruction states in the same Reconstruction legislature, Republican controlled, the same legislature which ratified the Fourteenth Amendment passed statutes continuing or immediately establishing segregated schools. I regard that as a fact of great significance. If there was any place where the Fourteenth Amendment and its sponsors would have blown 
the bugle for mixed schools and asserted that the Fourteenth 
Amendment had settled the question, surely it would have been those eight states 
under Reconstruction legislation, sympathetic to the party which was responsible 
for the submission of the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p>Now the appellants say in their brief that three-fourths of the ratifying states 
gave evidence that they thought the Fourteenth Amendment had abolished segregated 
schools, I can find in the history as detailed by all of these appendices no warrant 
whatever for any such assertion, for any such proportion of nonconcurring states. 
That is before Your Honors in the appendices, and you must, between the three points 
of view that I have indicated, make your selection. </p>
<p><b>The second question</b>: Neither the Congress in submitting, nor the states in ratifying, 
the Fourteenth Amendment understood that compliance with it would require the immediate 
abolition of segregation in public schools. </p>
<p>It was nevertheless the understanding of the framers of the Amendment that future 
congresses might, in the exercise of their power under section 5 of the Amendment, 
abolish segregation, or, (b), that it would be within the judicial power in light 
of future conditions to construe the Amendment as abolishing such segregation of its own force; and 
to that we answer: It was not the understanding of the framers of the Amendment that future congresses might, in the exercise 
of their power under section 5 of the Amendment, abolish segregation in public schools. 
And, (c), it was not the understanding of the framers of the Amendment that it would be within the judicial power, in 
light of future conditions, to construe the Amendment as abolishing segregation in public schools of its own force.
</p>
<p>It was not the understanding of the framers that Congress might, in the exercise 
of the power under section 5 of the Amendment, abolish segregation; and if we are right in the initial proposition that neither Congress nor the states thought the Amendment was dealing with the 
question of segregated schools, obviously section 5 of the Amendment could not give 
Congress more power than the Amendment itself had originally embraced. But the power 
given to Congress, we had noted, in section 5 is the power that—I thought I had 
the exact language—to enforce the provision of this article. And section 5 is not 
a Trojan horse which opened to Congress a wide field in which Congress might expand the boundaries of the article itself.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Mr. Davis, would not the necessary and proper clause apply 
to the Amendment as well as to the enumerated </p>
<p><b>MR. DAVIS</b>: Well, if you can imagine a necessary and proper clause which would 
enforce the provisions of this article by dealing with matter which is not within the scope of the article itself, which I think 
is a contradiction in terms, that is a paradox. Congress could do what the Amendment did not warrant under the guise of enforcing the 
Amendment. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: But you can look for the necessary and proper clause to determine whether it is something appropriate within the Amendment. </p>
<p><b>MR. DAVIS</b>: Quite so. That is if you use, choose, a monetary clause, related to 
congressional wisdom and policy; and to the judicial power, in answer to that question, we say that to interpret the Amendment as 
including something that it does not include is not to interpret the Amendment, 
but is to amend the Amendment, which is beyond the power of the Court. </p>
<p><b>The third question</b>: On the assumption the answers to questions 2(a) and (b) do not dispose of the issue, is it within the judicial power in construing the Amendment to abolish segregation in the public schools. 
And we answer: It is not within the judicial power to construe the Fourteenth Amendment 
adversely to the understanding of its framers as abolishing segregation in the public
schools. </p>
<p>Before we answer, we preface that with an expression of the extreme difficulty 
we have in making the initial assumption on which that question is based, where 
in our humble judgment the answers to question 1 and 2(a) and (b) do dispose of 
the issue in this case and dispose of it in the clearest and most emphatic manner.
</p>
<p><b>We go on in our answer</b>: Moreover, if in construing the Amendment the principle 
of stare decisis is applied, controlling precedents preclude a construction which 
would abolish segregation in the public schools. Now, we are cognizant of what this Court has said not 
once but several times, and what some of us have heard outside the Court as to the 
scope of stare decisis in constitutional matters, and it has been accepted that 
where there is a pronounced dissent from previous opinions in constitutional matters, 
mere difficulty in amendment leads the Court to bow to that change of opinion more than it would in matters of 
purely private rights. </p>
<p>But be that doctrine what it may, somewhere, sometime to every principle comes 
a moment of repose when it has been so often announced, so confidently relied upon, so long continued, that it passes the 
limits of judicial discretion and disturbance. That is the opinion which we held 
when we filed our former brief in this case. We relied on the fact that this Court 
had, not once but seven times, I think it is, pronounced in favor of the &quot;separate
but equal&quot; doctrine. We relied on the fact that the courts of last appeal of 
some sixteen or eighteen states have passed upon the validity of the &quot;separate but 
equal&quot; doctrine vis-a-vis the Fourteenth Amendment. We relied on the fact that Congress has continuously since 1862 segregated its schools in the District of Columbia. </p>
<p>We relied on the fact that 23 of the ratifying states—I think my figures are 
right; I am not sure—had by legislative action evinced their conviction that the 
Fourteenth Amendment was not offended by segregation; and we said, in effect, that 
that argument—and I am bold enough to repeat it here now—that, in the language of Judge Parker 
in his opinion below, after that had been the consistent history for over three-quarters 
of a century, it was late indeed in the day to disturb it on any theoretical or 
sociological basis. We stand on that proposition. </p>
<p>Then we go on that, even if the principle of stare decisis in controlling precedents 
be denied, the effect of the Amendment upon public school segregation examined 
<i>de 
novo</i>, that the doctrine of reasonable classification would protect this from the charge of any policy 
that is brought against us. </p>
<p>In Clarendon School District No. 1 in South Carolina, in which this case alone 
is concerned, there were in the last report that got into this record, something 
over a year or year and a half ago, 2,799 Negroes, registered Negro children of 
school age. There were 295 whites, and the state has now provided those 2,800 Negro
children with schools as good in every particular. In fact, because of their being newer, they may even be better. There are good teachers, the same 
curriculum as in the schools for the 295 whites. 
</p>
<p><b>Who is going to disturb that situation</b>: If they were to be reassorted or commingled, who knows how that could best be done? If it is done on the mathematical 
basis, with thirty children as a maximum, which I believe, is the accepted standard 
in pedagogy, you would have 27 Negro children and three whites in one school room. 
Would that make the children any happier? Would they learn any more quickly? Would 
their lives be more serene? </p>
<p>Children of that age are not the most considerate animals in the world, as we 
all know. Would the terrible psychological disaster being wrought, according to some of these witnesses, to the colored child be 
removed if he had three white children sitting somewhere in the same school room? 
Would white children be prevented from getting a distorted idea of racial relations 
if they sat with 27 Negro children? I have posed that question because it is the 
very one that cannot be denied. </p>
<p>You say that is racism. Well, it is not racism. Recognize that for sixty centuries 
and more humanity has been discussing questions of race and race tension, not racism. Say that we make special provisions for the aboriginal Indian population of this country; it is not racism. Say that 29 states have miscegenation statutes now in force 
which they believe are of beneficial protection to both races. Disraeli said, &quot;No 
man,&quot; said he, &quot;will treat with indifference the principle of race. It is the key of history.&quot; And it is not necessary to 
enter into any comparison of faculties or possibilities. You recognize differences which racism plants in the human animal. </p>
<p>Now, I want to spend some time on the fourth and fifth questions. They give us a little disturbance, and I don&#39;t feel they will greatly disturb 
the Court. </p>
<p>As to the question of the right of the Court to postpone the remedy, we think 
that adheres in every court of equity, and there has been no question about it as 
to power. </p>
<p>The fifth question, whether the Court should formulate a decree, we find nothing here on which this Court could formulate a decree, nor do we 
think the court below has any power to formulate a decree, reciting in what manner these schools are to be alternative at all, and what course the State of South Carolina shall take concerning it. 
Your Honors do not sit, and cannot sit, as a glorified Board of Education for the 
State of South Carolina or any other state. Neither can the district court. </p>
<p>Assuming, in the language of the old treaties about war, it is not to be expected 
and that, God forbid, that the Court should find that the statutes of the State 
of South Carolina violated the Constitution, it can so declare. If it should find 
that inequality is being practiced in the schools, it can enjoin its continuance.
</p>
<p>Neither this Court nor any other court, I respectfully submit, can sit in the 
chairs of the legislature of South Carolina and mold its educational system; and 
if it is found to be in its present form unacceptable, the State of South Carolina 
must devise the alternative. It establishes the schools, it pays the funds, and it has the sole power to educate 
its citizens. What they would do under these circumstances, I don&#39;t know. I do know, 
if the testimony is to be believed, that the result would not be pleasing. </p>
<p>Let me say this for the State of South Carolina. It does not come here, as Thad 
Stevens would have wished, in sackcloth and ashes. It believes that its legislation 
is not offensive to the Constitution of the United States. It is confident of its good faith and intention to produce 
equality for all of its children of whatever race or color. It is convinced that 
the happiness, the progress and the welfare of these children is best promoted in 
segregated schools, and it thinks it a thousand pities that by this controversy 
there should be urged the return to an experiment which gives no more promise of 
success today than when it was written into their Constitution during what I call the tragic era. </p>
<p>I am reminded—and I hope it won&#39;t be treated as a reflection on anybody—of Aesop&#39;s 
fable of the dog and the meat: The dog, with a fine piece of meat in his mouth, 
crossed a bridge and saw the shadow in the stream and plunged for it and lost both 
substance and shadow. Here is equal education, not promised, not prophesied, but present. 
Shall it be thrown away on some fancied question of racial prestige? </p>
<p>It is not my part to offer advice to the appellants and their supporters or sympathizers, 
and certainly not to the learned counsel. No doubt they think what they propose is best, and I do not challenge their sincerity 
in any particular period, but I entreat them to remember the age-old motto that 
the best is often the enemy of the good. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OF T. JUSTIN MOORE, ESQ., ON BEHALF <br />
OF APPELLEES, COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD OF <br />
PRINCE EDWARD COUNTY, VIRGINIA, ET AL. </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. MOORE</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>In undertaking to present the Virginia case, and in view of the fact that the 
facts are now so similar to those in the South Carolina case, I am aware that there will necessarily be covering of much of the same 
ground that my distinguished friend and associate, Mr. Davis, has covered. But we feel that we should present our own point of view.
</p>
<p>Starting with a very interesting table, if Your Honors will look at page 211 
and 212 of our brief, you will get a very quick and vivid conception of the impact 
that a decree such as is asked for against South Carolina and Virginia in these 
cases would produce. As you will see from page 212, we have there shown you the population by race 
in every state in this Union, and according to the 1850 census, and as you will 
see from that table, the proportions vary from practically zero up to 45.3 percent in Mississippi, with, near the 
bottom there, 22.1 percent in Virginia. </p>
<p>Now, if you look at page 211, you will see another very striking set of figures which shows that in these seventeen states in which segregation 
is now required, plus the District of Columbia, there is, according to this census, 
ten and a half million Negroes, 40.4 million whites, and that approximately seventy 
percent of the entire Negro population of the nation is in these seventeen states 
and in the District of Columbia. </p>
<p>It is very striking that the total percentage of the Negroes to total population 
is approximately ten percent, as you will notice there, ten percent of the total. 
In other words, there are fifteen million Negroes, according to the last census, 
in the nation as a whole, with ten and a half million of those Negroes, or approximately
seventy percent, in these seventeen states plus the District; so that when our 
opponents talk about the effect of segregation in some of these northern and western 
states, they are not talking about the practical condition with which we are here 
faced. In other words, there is actually today one-third of the nation in these 
seventeen states which, by law, have required segregation, approximately one-third 
of the population which lives in that situation. Now, that focuses attention, we believe, at the outset upon the facts of each 
situation, so that you cannot talk about this problem just in a vacuum in the manner of a law school discussion. 
</p>
<p>Now, this particular case, I believe, should be very briefly referred to as to the facts just as was done in the South Carolina case, particularly 
in view of the fact that the present Chief Justice was not sitting at that a year 
ago. This case comes from one of the smaller and poorer counties in Virginia, Prince 
Edward County. It is about 130 miles from this very spot. </p>
<p>There were three high schools in Prince Edward County at the time this litigation 
arose. The best of those was the Farmville High School for whites; the poorest was 
the Worsham High School for whites; and in the middle was the Moton School for Negroes.
</p>
<p>Now, the record shows that the school authorities during the ten-year period 
just before this suit was filed had had a very unexpected and difficult problem. In 1941 there were 540 white high school students in the 
county and only 208 Negro students. In ten years, by 1951, those relationships had 
changed tremendously. The white school students numbered 405, while the Negroes 
had increased to 463. In other words, there had been a decline of 25 percent in 
the white, but an increase of 120 odd percent in the colored. </p>
<p>Now, of course, during that period, during much of the time, it was not practical 
to obtain the necessary materials for construction of facilities that would be absolutely equal. But we are glad to say that in 
quality that does not any longer exist. The new Moton High School has now been completed, which was in 
process of construction when we were here a year ago. It has been completed at a 
cost of something more than 800,000 dollars. </p>
<p>The details of that are shown in the appendix at the end of our brief where there 
are certificates furnished there by the architects and Superintendent of Schools, showing that money being furnished either through 
loans or grants from the State of Virginia. </p>
<p>And it is a striking fact that this is just not an isolated case. This brand 
new high school which has now been completed and was occupied beginning the first 
of September is only one of a large number of similar projects. The State has in 
effect a program over the next four years of more than 250 millions of dollars, with a view to equalizing the facilities. They are able to do it, they intend 
to do it, and according to the records in this case, about half of the job has been 
done. </p>
<p>Now, just as in the South Carolina case, this suit was brought with two purposes. 
The first was the charge that segregation per se was a violation of the Fourteenth 
Amendment, and to support that charge the appellants here introduced expert testimony. 
I, of course, cannot go into that in detail here. We reviewed that a year ago. But 
it is sufficient to say that if expert testimony ever was discredited, the testimony 
in this case was. </p>
<p>Now, on the other hand, on our side of the case—and this is the most distinctive 
feature of this case—we called seven distinguished experts ourselves and attacked the theories, the factual theories that were relied 
on by the other side, four distinguished educators, a psychiatrist, a psychologist 
and a distinguished professor of Columbia University, the head of the department of psychology. And through our testimony we show perfectly clearly that the factual contentions 
that were made by the other side as to detriment to the Negro child were not borne 
out, as a matter of fact. And the court found on the crucial point in its opinion 
to this effect. The court said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In this milieu we cannot say that vast separation of white and colored children in the public schools is without substance in fact or reason. We have found no hurt or harm to either race. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it is striking that in three of these five cases there was no evidence 
presented countervailing the Negroes&#39; evidence. In the Kansas case, the District 
case and the Delaware case, expert evidence was presented which was not contradicted by opposing evidence. In the South Carolina case there was some opposing evidence, not to any great degree such as was in the Virginia case, so 
that the Virginia case really stands out in opposition, for example, to the 
Kansas finding, where the Virginia court has found on the evidence, after five 
days of hearings, that the Negroes have failed to prove their case as a matter 
of fact. </p>
<p>Now, there was an inequality of facilities, which we admitted. We were required 
by the lower court to equalize. We have now done that, and so far as we know, we 
are precisely in the same situation as the South Carolina case. I don&#39;t think there is any dispute about that now from our friends on the other side. </p>
<p>Now, may I just, for a moment, touch questions four and five. Question four in 
substance is an inquiry as to our position on the question of gradual adjustment 
if the Court finds against us. We think it is perfectly clear, as Mr. Davis has 
pointed out, that in the event we are faced with the distressing situation of an 
adverse decree, that the Court as a court of equity plainly has the power and the duty, 
in situations like this, to permit a gradual adjustment, as a court of equity considering 
the balancing of equities. That is all briefed and I don&#39;t want to take up time 
in that discussion. </p>
<p>On the fifth question, the question is whether or not, if there is an adverse 
decree, whether the case should be remanded to the lower court or should a master 
be appointed, or some other way that the matter should be handled. We think it is 
perfectly clear that if there should be this unhappy, unfortunate decree, that the 
case should be remanded to the lower court where local conditions could be considered, 
where new evidence would be received. Considering what might be appropriate in Kansas, wouldn&#39;t necessarily be appropriate in South Carolina or Virginia. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: What kind of guidance, if any, should be given to the 
district court on this unhappy hypothesis of your argument? </p>
<p><b>MR. MOORE</b>: It really distresses me to face that question. About all I can say, 
Your Honor, is we feel the courts should be given the broadest possible discretion 
to act along reasonable lines. It is a matter of a reasonable exercise of discretion. 
That is the best answer, I believe, I can give. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I suppose, and Mr. Davis touched on it before when it 
was asked, it is one thing to ask a district court to lay out districts, school 
districts. </p>
<p><b>MR. MOORE</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I suppose that is one thing. But to have the parties 
or the state which would be involved, whatever the political unit, say, &quot;This is what we are going to 
do,&quot; and have the district court pass on whether that conforms to this hypothetical
decree, is another thing, isn&#39;t it? </p>
<p><b>MR. MOORE</b>: Well, Your Honor, we think, to further answer the question—I did not 
intend to just drop it summarily. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I beg your pardon, I am sorry, Please go your own way, 
Mr. Moore. </p>
<p><b>MR. MOORE</b>: No, no, I want to answer Your Honor, We think that following the theory 
of, say, the antitrust cases, that the party certainly should be allowed to present 
a plan, rather than for the Court just to hand down a plan. Perhaps that is a more 
accurate and a better answer. I did not give quite as fluent an answer as I should 
have originally. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: In the Paramount case in New York, as you know— </p>
<p><b>MR. MOORE</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: —there was I don&#39;t know how long a proceeding before 
Judge Hand and his associates in which there was conformity by the parties going 
on as proposed by what this Court decided, which was made a matter of independent 
extensive litigation and consideration. </p>
<p><b>MR. MOORE</b>: That&#39;s right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Is your suggestion that kind of solution? </p>
<p><b>MR. MOORE</b>: That&#39;s right. </p>
<p>I think undoubtedly that the decree should be a decree that would give broad 
discretion and permit the parties involved to present an appropriate plan that would 
be in conformity with the decision of this Court, but leaving a great deal of latitude 
for the parties to present their own kind of plan. </p>
<p>Now, in view of the discussion of Mr. Davis, I am going to pass rather rapidly 
on the first question. The remaining questions which Your Honors posed for us to 
investigate and discuss might be summarized very briefly in this way: The Court 
said to us to investigate what was the congressional understanding and intent of 
the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to this matter of its impact 
on schools, both from the standpoint of that time and from the standpoint of what 
they contemplated future congresses might do or what this Court might do. Secondly, 
what was the understanding and intent of the 33 out of the 37 states that ratified? 
And the third question was: What is the judicial power of this Court? To what extent is it properly within the judicial power of this 
Court to outlaw segregation just by force of the Amendment and the decision of this 
Court? </p>
<p>Now there are six major pieces of legislation that were involved in that first question. I will just enumerate them for convenience, and then only touch the more important ones. </p>
<p>The first one was the Freedmen&#39;s, the supplemental Freedmen&#39;s Bureau Bill in this 39th Congress of 1866, which, as Mr. Davis pointed out, provided 
for certain relief, authorized certain relief for these freedmen; but nowhere is 
the effect on mixed schools really involved in that at all. </p>
<p>The second is the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The third is the Fourteenth Amendment 
Resolution. The fourth is the legislation with regard to District schools. The fifth 
are the amnesty bills, and sixth is the Civil Rights of 1875. </p>
<p>Now, it is a striking thing that that first supplemental Freedmen&#39;s Bill undertook to cover almost precisely the same rights, the same subject matter 
as the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The supplemental Freedmen&#39;s Bill covered only the seceding states. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 
covered all the states. </p>
<p>The Rights bill fell into five groups, and everywhere through the debates you 
will see these five groups of rights being dealt with. The first was the right to 
contract. The second was the right to hold property, to inherit it, to transfer 
it, to lease it and what-not. The third was the right to sue and be sued and give evidence in court. The fourth 
was the right to equal security, no improper seizures, no searches and so forth. 
Equal rights in respect of security. And the fifth was a group of rights that assured equal punishment for the same offenses. </p>
<p>Now, it is very striking that when this Civil Rights Act of 1866 was submitted, 
it was submitted by Senator Trumbull, who, as we show repeatedly in our brief, very 
clearly and finally came out very definitely on the specific point—and he was the 
proponent—that the right to go to public school was not regarded as a civil right. That is what 
he said repeatedly in those days. </p>
<p>Now, that was the five groups of rights that were covered. Notice what he said. 
I want to just leave in these few moments in your minds two quotations. </p>
<p>I agree entirely with the thought expressed this morning that you can&#39;t judge 
the intent of Congress by what one senator might have said here or what another 
congressman said there, but, as this Court has repeatedly said, what the sponsors 
of the legislation say is entitled to particular weight. That is the Duplex doctrine, 
that is the doctrine in the Calvert case which Mr. Justice Douglas 
repeatedly delivered the opinion on, and I want to leave 
in your minds what these two sponsors said. Trumbull, as the sponsor of the Civil 
Rights Act, Wilson in the House, who was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee—and 
here is what Trumbull said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The first section of this bill defines what I understand to be civil rights, 
the right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, to be sued, to give evidence, to 
inherit, purchase, sell, lease, hold, convey real and personal property. It is confined 
exclusively to their civil rights. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you couple that with his own statement that the right to go to school is 
not a civil right. </p>
<p><b>Here is what Wilson said over on the House side</b>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nor do they mean that children shall attend the same schools. These are not civil 
rights. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Later on he said</b>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When he talks about setting aside the school laws of the states by the bill now 
under consideration, he steps beyond what he must know to be the rule of construction which must apply 
here. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when you read these debates, as I hope to show you tomorrow, there were three types of rights which they all finally admitted were not civil rights. The first one was the right to vote, which was never given 
until the Fifteenth Amendment. The second was the right to marry a white woman or the other way. The third was the right 
to go to mixed schools. </p>
<p>Now, as I hope to show Your Honors tomorrow morning, those were certainly three 
vital rights, in spite of all this talk about equality of men, which were never 
intended to be given under that bill. </p>
<p>Now, the Attorney General, as Mr. Davis points out, says that, in view of this 
conflict, he sets one off against the other. He says he doesn&#39;t believe any interpretation 
is practical here. He asserts that the proponents and opponents both express the view that the act would outlaw 
or would not outlaw separate but equal schools. Two of the people he refers to are 
Kerr and Delano, I will have you bear in mind. They were speaking of cases where 
there were schools for whites and no schools for Negroes. </p>
<p>Senator Cowan, the only senator who insisted on the point of view that it might 
open up the schools, as we point out in our brief, later changed his mind in the 
light of further debate, and he said he became convinced that the rights are here, 
that the rights are those which I here enumerated. And only Rogers of New Jersey,
the most bitter opponent, stands out in the House in the final showdown, who 
was insistent that the right to go to school, the mixed schools, might be produced. 
</p>
<p>As we said in the Calvert case, may I just close this part of the discussion 
with this question. The Court said here: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The fears and doubts of the opposition are no authoritative guide to the construction 
of legislation. It is the sponsors that should be looked to when the meaning of the statutory 
words is in doubt. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that brings me to the Fourteenth Amendment itself. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><b>PROCEEDINGS </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: This is in the matter of a hearing before the United States Supreme Court in the segregation cases held on Tuesday, 
December 8, 1953. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OFT. JUSTIN MOORE, ESQ., ON BEHALF OF <br />
APPELLEES, COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD OF PRINCE <br />
EDWARD COUNTY, VIRGINIA, <i>ET AL</i>.—RESUMED </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. MOORE</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>At the adjournment yesterday afternoon, I had referred briefly in presenting 
our side of the Virginia case to the fourth and fifth questions. Perhaps I was very 
brief, but we felt in comparison with these other great questions, that we dealt 
with those very fully in our brief, and I hope my statement was sufficient as to 
our position as to gradual adjustment and as to the kind of decree in the event 
of an adverse decision. </p>
<p>I started in the discussion of the first great question, one, as to congressional 
intent and understanding. In view of Mr. Davis&#39;s very extensive discussion on that 
matter and also on the question of the states&#39; understanding, I shall try to be 
quite brief on those two next questions, and will simply try to pinpoint what we 
regard as the high point as to both those matters, and give the greater part of 
my time to what we believe now, in view of questions from the Court as well as from 
the former hearing, what is perhaps the larger question as to judicial power.
</p>
<p>Your Honors will recall that I had pointed out that there are six classes of 
legislation which throw a great deal of light on the intent of Congress. I had touched on the first two, the Freedmen&#39;s Bill, which is significant 
here only in this respect: that that was the first bill in which Congress had undertaken 
to provide for the Negro, for public schools at public expense, and the significant thing is, they were 
separate schools. </p>
<p>I had then proceeded to discuss the 1866 Civil Rights Act and had undertaken 
to point out to you the great change that was made in that Act. As the Act was originally 
introduced, it had broad language which provided that all discrimination in civil rights and immunities 
as to all inhabitants on account of race is prohibited. And because of constitutional 
questions that had been raised and arguments on policy, that language was changed around to the specific language that you 
now find in the bill as it was finally passed. </p>
<p>Now, I had pointed out that there were these five groups of rights that were 
listed, and the sponsors of the bill made clear that those were the rights intended, 
and only those. Now, there is no difficulty about Strauder when you look at it in 
that light. The fourth group of rights was their right to equal security, and all 
that Strauder held was the right to have a Negro possibly on the jury was a part 
of his right of equal security. </p>
<p>I also tried to point out that there were three classes of rights which, by debate, 
were clearly eliminated in that list of rights. The first was the right of suffrage, 
which, as we all know, in spite of this argument about equal rights, was never given 
the Negro until two years later in 1870 when the Fifteenth Amendment was passed 
although the Thirteenth had freedom from slavery. The second was the right of intermarriage, 
which was clearly not intended to be included, in spite of the broad language; and 
this right of mixed schools. Now, those were three that were clearly pointed out 
in all the debates and were not intended to be covered. </p>
<p>That brings us therefore to the third important piece of legislation, which was the Fourteenth Amendment itself. As Your Honors recall, that Amendment 
really sprung out of the debates on the Civil Rights Act, because it was argued 
that the Civil Rights Act, even in spite of the Thirteenth Amendment that freed 
the slaves, was still not constitutional. So the Amendment sprung from that. </p>
<p>It came from the Joint Committee on Reconstruction. That Committee was composed 
of nine representatives and six senators. The majority were radicals, although Senator 
Sumner was considered too radical for membership, we find, from a very interesting letter from Senator 
Fessenden&#39;s son. It is in our opinions. His friends wouldn&#39;t put him on there.
</p>
<p>The Chairman was Senator Fessenden of Maine and he was ill much of the time, 
and Senator Howard of Michigan took the lead in his place. The House leader was 
the famous Co-Chairman; that is, Stevens. </p>
<p>Now, the Amendment here again is debated in two forms, very much like the Civil 
Rights Act. In its first form it purported to confer on Congress the affirmative 
power to make all laws that were necessary to secure privileges and immunities and equal 
protection. That version, though, was considered too broad, just as was the broad language 
in the original Civil Rights Act. </p>
<p>And finally, in May of that year, the Amendment was reported in the form that is now found, and, as Your Honors probably are thoroughly familiar 
with it, there are two sentences, really, in the first section. The first was the 
sentence put in by Senator Howard, which defined citizenship, that everyone born and naturalized in this country, 
regardless of race, was a citizen; and the second sentence, which Mr. Bingham wrote, 
was the same section we are here concerned with, which switched around the approach 
to the matter from a grant of affirmative power to Congress to a denial of power 
to the states. </p>
<p>Now, in both the House and the Senate the debates made one thing clear. The purpose 
of the first section of the Amendment was simply to write the Civil Rights Act into 
the Constitution. Stevens, the sponsor in the House, said that; Howard of Michigan 
said that; and numerous others, which I will not take time to enumerate. </p>
<p>The reasons were very interesting. The Democrats persistently charged the Republicans 
with trying to constitutionalize the Civil Rights Act. They said, &quot;That is all you 
are trying to do, is to legalize it.&quot; On the other hand, the Republicans replied, &quot;Yes, that is what we want to 
do, but we want to nail it down so it can&#39;t be repealed.&quot; </p>
<p>That is what Stevens said in perfectly clear language as the leader, and, as 
I pointed out yesterday, we look primarily to Stevens and Howard, people like that, and Wilson in the House, to find out really what 
they are talking about, the proponents. </p>
<p>Now, the appellants here assert two things. They first quote these broad statements 
about equal privileges and immunities that certain members of Congress and the Senate 
wanted to assure, and next they assert that the Amendment went beyond those civil 
rights that we have in the Civil Rights Act. Neither statement, in our judgment, 
is a safeguard to this Court, because it is perfectly plain from the extracts in 
our brief and appendix and in the South Carolina brief, that these radical people 
never were able to go as far as they wanted. Stevens admitted that frankly. So did 
Howard at the end. </p>
<p>So the Amendment was proposed in the form with these two sentences, Howard&#39;s 
definition of citizenship and Bingham&#39;s statement of denial of rights to the states to deny equal protection of the laws. Now, 
the debates give convincing evidence that it was not intended to abolish segregated 
schools; but confirmation comes from two other sources which were mentioned, one of them particularly yesterday. I will just touch it very briefly. </p>
<p>The next step is the District school legislation, which our opponents, our colored friends, saw fit in their brief to completely ignore, and which the Attorney General comes in and dusts off with just a gesture, 
saying it was dealt with casually. </p>
<p>The most significant thing in that legislation, Your Honors, aside from the fact 
that just a month after slavery was abolished here in the District in 1862 and separate 
schools were set up for Negroes, is this fact: I am not going to review it all, 
but keep in mind this fact, that in 1866, in July, 1866, within one month after 
the Fourteenth Amendment was proposed in June, 1866, this Congress passed these two bills in which they dealt with these separate schools. In one 
case they provided for property to be transferred for the use solely of those schools. 
In the second bill they appropriated money in proportion to the number of Negroes 
to whites; and yet, these gentlemen are bold enough to come up and say, because 
that legislation passed without great debate, that it was not carefully considered.
</p>
<p>Now, passing on from the District school legislation, let&#39;s take the next important 
piece of legislation. I will mention it; it was the amnesty bills. Those bills were 
debated with greatest heat in Congress with a view to granting amnesty to Southerners 
who participated in the war. And on two occasions Charles Sumner undertook to draft, 
to tack onto those bills his Civil Rights bill, which included a requirement that 
the Negroes should be given equal status as to schools, churches, cemeteries, theaters 
and what-not. And in respect to each of those he lost out, and the bills were finally passed 
without them. </p>
<p>Now, one more reference and I am through with this part of the case. We should 
not lose sight of the 1875 Civil Rights Act. This matter was not finally ended until 
the 1875 Act was dealt with, the famous right—the famous Act which was held unconstitutional
in the Civil Rights Cases. And therein, in respect of that Act, which was introduced 
by General Butler of Massachusetts, the effort was being made as the last effort 
on this matter to write into the civil rights bill the fact that the Negroes should 
be given equal status in schools, churches, cemeteries, theaters and what-not.
</p>
<p>Finally, in order to get something passed, because the Republicans lost out—there were a hundred people who lost their seats in Congress just about 
that time on the Republican side—and to try to get something through, they struck 
out all reference to schools and the cemeteries and things of that sort, and the 
Act was passed without it, and that was the last effort made to write into 
this legislation all of this business about equal rights as to schools. So how our friends on 
the other side can get comfort out of that story, when they can point only to Rogers of New Jersey and occasionally to a remark made by Senator Cowan, is beyond us to understand. </p>
<p>Now, let me turn just very briefly to the state end of this. There is a very 
interesting chart in our brief. I have called Your Honors&#39; attention to one yesterday, 
which was the chart of the 1950 Census. If you look at page 150, you will see the 
Census of 1870, where, for the first time after the Amendment was adopted, we get 
a Census including the Negro; and that chart is very illuminating as to what was done with these states. Mr. Davis discussed it yesterday, and 
I will not take much time on it. I will just comment on two or three points. </p>
<p>As you see from that chart, there are five states, including Maine, New Hampshire, 
and so forth, where the question of segregation never was even pertinent at all, never even came up, and in those states the 
Negro was not quite two-tenths of one percent of the population. </p>
<p>There is another group of states, such as Massachusetts, Michigan, and so forth, where slavery had been abolished before the Amendment, or where 
it was abolished about that time, and it is less than one percent of the Negroes 
in those states; so it was of no moment. </p>
<p>You then turn to the 23 states, the principal ones that are left. My friend, 
Judge Almond, who will follow me in a brief talk about the seceding states as to 
which there is an abominable conspiracy charged here by our opponents, is going to talk about the seceding states. But 
there what happened was that the same legislature that adopted the Fourteenth Amendment passed these laws that required segregation.
</p>
<p>Well, how could that be clear evidence that they didn&#39;t understand that the Amendment prevented that? But I submit to you that the significant thing 
in this whole state story is the fact that there were seven of the great states—and 
I will name them: New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and 
Pennsylvania—as to which our opponents are unable to lay any finger of scorn; and every one of 
those states had segregation before the Amendment was adopted, and they continued 
segregation for years thereafter; in California until 1880, in Illinois until 1874, 
in New Jersey until 1881, in Ohio until 1887, in Pennsylvania until 1881, and in 
New York until 1930. </p>
<p>And in addition to that, we have the supreme courts of those states—Ohio was 
the first in 1871—which passed directly on the matter and held that the equal facilities, 
equal doctrine, was not in violation of the Constitution. California filed suit 
with the decision of its supreme court, then Pennsylvania and New York. I will not take further 
time on it. The record is perfectly clear. And how these gentlemen try to explain 
away that record with respect to those states is beyond our understanding. </p>
<p>Now turning finally to the third question as to judicial power, as we understood 
that question, we understood that the Court had in mind in asking us whether the 
Court had judicial power of itself to abolish segregation, we understood that the Court had in mind perhaps three 
approaches to it, which I will deal with very briefly. </p>
<p>The first is whether or not this is a case where there should be a restraint 
of judicial power and the matter left to the legislative bodies. The second is whether 
or not, in the light of precedents, this is a case lasting over these hundred years 
where it would be an abuse of power in the light of that history. It is what Mr. 
Davis called yesterday the time where there should be some time, a period of repose 
when a matter is really settled. That is the second question. And the third branch is whether or not there is some idea here of a living Constitution 
and changing conditions that should make a difference. I am going to talk just very 
briefly about those three. </p>
<p>As we pointed out, segregation in education does exist in these seventeen states 
and the District where 55 million people live. In many of these states it is written 
into the constitution. And we submit that the first point to bear in mind on this 
phase of the case is the principle that was mentioned in Justice Jackson&#39;s opinion
here yesterday, and so well put by Justice Brandeis many years ago: that in a 
situation like this the statute of a particular constitution comes before Your Honors with a presumption of constitutionality. 
</p>
<p>In the second place, we point out that this is not a case of some novel or modern 
experiment such as has been involved in so many cases before Your Honors, where 
these old doctrines have been attempted to be applied to some modern situation. 
Here the statute is as old as the Constitution itself, and the novel principles 
are those that are brought in issue here by our opponents. </p>
<p>Finally, we must refer to the field of legislative action. Mr. Justice Holmes 
has very well expressed the thought when he said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and the welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We submit that the Court must coordinate the field for its operations with that 
of the legislative branch in a case particularly of this kind. What we urge is that the size, the history 
of this problem before the Court here, makes it clear that the solution should be left with the 
legislatures. This case presents a matter, we submit, for judicial restraint if there ever was a case presented. We don&#39;t mean judicial 
restraint here in the sense of these political cases such as have been referred 
to by the other side. What we do urge is that this question should be left to the 
duly elected representatives of the people. </p>
<p>Now, in touching just the second question as to what is the true situation here 
in the light of history of the decisions of this Court and the many state courts, 
in view of questions between Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Marshall yesterday, 
I can touch that very briefly. I need only point out that this &quot;separate but equal&quot; 
doctrine is not a new doctrine; it is more than one hundred years old. </p>
<p>It was first presented to the nation in Roberts against Poston in 1849, and there 
was upheld under the Massachusetts Constitution in fundamentals like we have here. From that time on it got written in the various 
state statutes, as I have just pointed out. It was continued, it was debated back 
and forth in the halls of Congress here between 1862 and 1875. In states like Virginia and Georgia it was written into fundamental law in 1870. </p>
<p>These state court cases came along in 1871, 1873 and 1874. In Hall v. DeCuir 
in 1877, Mr. Justice Clifford there in the Steamboat case, where the State of Louisiana, in a legislature dominated by Negroes and 
carpetbaggers, had passed a law requiring the mixing of people on these boats, that 
was held unconstitutional under the commerce clause; and he had recognized the doctrine 
in his concurring opinion there. </p>
<p>So the Court came in 1896 to Plessy v. Ferguson. There was nothing new to present, 
and I am glad to find that our gentlemen on the other side here differ from their 
position here a year ago. They do not come here trying to distinguish Plessy v. 
Ferguson and Gong Lum from this case. They were here a year ago saying Plessy v. 
Ferguson was a railroad case, and the Gong Lum case was a Chinese case, and they 
could be distinguished; but I am very glad Mr. Marshall marched right up to the 
point. He said, &quot;Now, we are asking that this Court go further than it has ever 
gone before and overrule Plessy v. Ferguson and Gong Lum,&quot; because that is what has got to 
be done for the decree that he asks to be entered. </p>
<p>I am not going to review these more recent cases. As was pointed out, it was 
admitted here yesterday these gentlemen are not happy with these recent cases of 
Sweatt v. Painter nor McLaurin, for that matter. McLaurin there in the 
Department of Education in Oklahoma was set apart, true enough; but he was set 
apart in a way so it was just as if he had the sign, &quot;Here is a leper, here is a 
leper, don&#39;t touch him.&quot; In very proper words, said, &quot;Well, you can&#39;t do that. 
That is not any proper application of the doctrine.&quot; So we find the Court under 
the Chief Justice saying in Sweatt v. Painter, which they don&#39;t like on the 
other side, &quot;Nor do we need to reach the petitioners&#39; contention that Plessy v. 
Ferguson should be reexamined.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, coming finally to the last phase of this matter that I just spoke of, and 
that is whether or not there are changed conditions that may warrant some different application of the doctrine. The appellants urge 
that these precedents should be overruled. They don&#39;t urge merely changed conditions. 
Practically every argument these gentlemen present, Your Honors will find that Charles Sumner presented 
just as effectively and just as oratorically in 1870 and in that period as they presented it. </p>
<p>The real crux of their argument is the fact they contend that the mere act of 
separation is a badge of inferiority, and that was his theme, that is what he dedicated 
his life to long before the Amendment and until his death in 1874. </p>
<p>Now, if we are going to look at this matter from the standpoint of precedent, the rule is pretty simple. The rule is that the state may classify 
and the test of its classification is merely within the bounds of reason. Mr. Justice 
Hughes well said, quoting him: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The inquiry must be whether considering the end in view, the statute passes the 
bounds of reason and assumes the character of a mere arbitrary fiat. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, how is &quot;reasonable&quot; to be decided here? It can&#39;t be decided in a vacuum. It has got to be decided in the light of all the surrounding facts. 
Now, what are the local conditions in Virginia where we are concerned? In our case 
the superintendent, State Superintendent of Public Construction, testified that the people, Negroes and whites alike, believed that the best interests of both the whites and the 
Negroes are that the separate schools are best. A former Superintendent of Public 
Education testified that segregation caused no warped personalities, and that the general welfare would be definitely 
harmed by mixed schools in Virginia. </p>
<p>A distinguished child psychiatrist testified in this case that the amalgamation 
would result in increased anxieties which would be detrimental to both races. The 
Chairman of Psychology in the Department of Columbia testified—and he is a Virginia boy, educated 
in Virginia, went up to the big city where he has been a great teacher for these 
many years—he testified with full knowledge of Virginia conditions that the 
result of segregation in Virginia produced better education for both races. </p>
<p>Now, what are we going to do with that testimony? Are we just going to disregard 
it? Can this Court now say that on the basis of this record, segregation is beyond the bounds of reason, that it is an arbitrary 
fiat? We don&#39;t believe so. </p>
<p>I would like to say this in conclusion, may it please Your Honors: We are trying 
to be fair as we know how about this matter. It is a matter on which there is great feeling in these seventeen states. We 
recognize that there are a great many people of the highest character and position 
who disapprove of segregation as a matter of principle or as ethics. We think that 
most of them really do not know the conditions, particularly in the South, that 
brought about that situation. That was true of all these witnesses, these experts 
that appeared in our Virginia case. They did not know a thing about Virginia, they 
all admitted, and they are not familiar with the way in which it is gradually being 
worked out. But those feelings that I refer to are not relevant here. </p>
<p><b>Mr. Justice Holmes had very well put the thought when he said</b>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is nothing that I deprecate more than the use of the Fourteenth Amendment 
beyond the absolute compulsion of its words to prevent the making of social experiments that an important part of the community desires, 
in the insulated chambers afforded by the several States, even though those experiments 
may seem futile or even noxious to me and to those whose judgment I most respect.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that sound? We believe it is. And just look at the picture that faces the 
seventeen states as I leave this matter with you. These states start at Maryland. 
They go all the way down to Texas, to the Gulf of Mexico. They go out as far west 
as Missouri and Oklahoma, with a third of the nation included in those states with 
ten and a half million Negroes in those states, seventy percent of the Negroes in 
the whole nation in those states. </p>
<p>During this hundred-year period since Roberts and Boston has been the law, millions 
and millions of dollars have been spent in building up these systems. There are 
thousands of school houses, fine school houses, all over these seventeen states. 
As a matter of fact, these gentlemen here have one of the finest school buildings 
in the nation just completed, which they moved into on September the first. </p>
<p>What are we to do with that situation? Are we to go and put in this country—there 
are about five and a half Negroes to every five white persons—shall we put one Negro 
along with every white child in high school when that is the best high school? I 
say to you that there is looking down on you from every one of these high school 
sections, every elementary school in these seventeen states, with anxiety as to 
what you shall do with this. </p>
<p>In our humble judgment there is not anything that could be more serious than 
an adverse decision. And I want to leave that matter just with this thought which 
our friend Judge Parker in the South Carolina case has expressed better than anywhere 
I know. Here is the way he summed it up, after referring to Plessy v. Ferguson
and Gong Lum and the great judges that sat in those cases. He said:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To this we may add that, when seventeen states and the Congress of the United 
States have for more than three-quarters of a century required segregation of the races in the public schools, and when this has received 
the approval of the leading appellate courts of the country including the unanimous 
approval of the Supreme Court of the United States at a time when that Court included 
Chief Justice Taft, Justices Stone, Holmes and Brandeis, it is a late day to say 
that such legislation is violative of fundamental constitutional rights. </p>
  <p>It is hardly reasonable to suppose that the legislative bodies of so wide a territory, 
including the Congress of the United States and the great judges of high courts, have knowingly
defied the Constitution for so long a period or that they have acted in ignorance of the meaning of its provisions. The constitutional
principle is the same now that it has been throughout this period; and if conditions 
have changed so that segregation is no longer wise, this is a matter for the legislatures 
and not for the courts. The members of the judiciary have no more right to read their ideas of sociology into the Constitution than 
their ideas of economics. </p>

<p>Thank you. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: General Almond? </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OF J. LINDSAY ALMOND, ESQ., ON BEHALF 
<br />
OF APPELLEES, COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD OF PRINCE <br />
EDWARD COUNTY, VIRGINIA, ET AL. </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. ALMOND</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>Mr. Moore assigned to me a rather Herculean task, and I have no time in which 
to address myself to that phase of the case which I would like to discuss. </p>
<p>As the only official of one of the seceding states privileged to actively participate 
in this case, I just want to, if Your Honors please, take a few moments, the few 
moments which remain, to bring to your attention this phrase: What are they here 
asking for? They are asking this Court, contrary to the intention of the Congress
which proposed the Fourteenth Amendment, as evidenced irrevocably by the records 
of that historic session and during those years, they are asking you to make a decision 
contrary to the spirit, the intent and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. They are asking you to amend 
the Constitution of the United States and to go further than the Congress ever intended 
that this Court should go. 
</p>
<p>They are asking you to disturb and tear down the principle of stare decisis enunciated 
so clearly in 1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson, reimplemented again in 1899 in Cumming 
v. Board, clearly enunciated again in 1927 in Gong Lum v. Rice, and even though driven to the wall yesterday, 
the ingenious counsel of the opposition in a fruitless effort to confess and avoid, 
finally admitted that the very basis of the latest decisions of this Court on that 
subject, beginning with Gaines v. Canada in 1938, followed by Sipuel in 1948, by Sweatt v. Painter 
and McLaurin in 1950, that the very basis of those latter cases was predicated upon 
the doctrine enunciated in Plessy v. Ferguson: separate but equal facilities do 
not offend any provision of the Constitution of the United States. </p>
<p>They are asking you to overturn the principle of stare decisis laid down by this 
Court and the courts of last resort of every state in this Union that a solemn constitutional 
provision or legislative enactment carries with it the highest presumption known 
to law, that it is a valid exercise of the powers of the body which enacted it.
</p>
<p>They are asking you to disturb the unfolding evolutionary process of education 
where from the dark days of the depraved institution of slavery, with the help and 
the sympathy and the love and the respect of the white people of the South, the 
colored man has risen under that educational process to a place of eminence and 
respect throughout this nation. It has served him well. </p>
<p>In those days as now, the states were dealing with the question of policy. 
Questions have been asked here or submitted by this Court as to what directions 
there should be in any adverse decree handed down, adverse to the appellees in 
this case. I like the language of Mr. Justice Holmes when he said--I believe it 
was Mr. Justice Holmes—no, probably not, but in the case of International Salt 
in 332 U.S.:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is not the province of the appellate court to write decrees. That is within 
the province and the equipment of the District Court. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say to this Court on that question, in the event of an adverse decision 
to our side, that the case be remanded with direction to the lower court to conduct a hearing taking into consideration the vast administrative difficulties which would be occasioned as a result of 
such a decision. </p>
<p>We must determine from Virginia what we are going to do with our compulsory attendance 
law in the event of an adverse decision. We must determine whether we will have 
one system or three systems, if the dual system is destroyed. </p>
<p>It is a matter, sir, of great import to these states affected. What crime has 
Virginia committed? She has within the last fifteen years gone further in the promotion of education on an equal facilities basis 
than almost, I can say, any state in the South. Within the last four years she has appropriated 75 millions of dollars, which has been 
more than matched by the political subdivisions, to increase the facilities of our 
public school system, and most of that has been spent to equalize facilities which 
needed to be equalized. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: General Almond, let me ask you a question to see whether 
I understand your suggestion. </p>
<p><b>MR. ALMOND</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Of these systems, the choice is of going to what is 
called an integrated school, but in default of that, deciding of the choice then, 
it will be shepherded into one or the other; is that what you mean by the decree?
</p>
<p><b>MR. ALMOND</b>: I didn&#39;t mean, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, shepherding in that sense. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is a bad word. If they do not choose to go to unmixed 
schools, then they would have to go to a separate school, is that right? I f they 
do not choose to go to a mixed school which is open to them, then they would have 
to go to one or the other; is that what you mean, General Almond? </p>
<p><b>MR. ALMOND</b>: I said, sir, that that is the matter of policy 
which the states— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Yes, I understand; but is that what you meant? </p>
<p><b>MR. ALMOND</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Those are the three which you have in mind? </p>
<p><b>MR. ALMOND</b>: That is right, sir, which the state would have to determine. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Yes, I understand that. It is a very hypothetical answer 
on that, but I just wanted to understand you. </p>
<p><b>MR. ALMOND</b>: That is a matter of legislative policy. </p>
<p>Now, if Your Honors please, I guess my time has just about expired. I would like 
to say one thing in behalf of the seceding states, if there was ever such a thing, 
why they have been indicted by the opposition of treachery, of fraud, of conniving 
to subvert the Fourteenth Amendment. I ask our friends of the opposition to consider 
this: that when the constitutional conventions were created in the South, think of their composition. There were 101 delegates to the constitutional convention which framed the new constitution of the great State of Alabama. Of these there were 18 Negroes, 38 carpetbaggers 
and 45 scalawags. </p>
<p>Now, I do not use those two latter terms in any sense of opprobrium. Mr. Webster defines a carpetbagger as a roving venturer meddling in the politics of a locality in which he has no interest. History defines 
a scalawag as a white southerner who associated with the machinations of the carpetbaggers.
</p>
<p>Now, Georgia&#39;s constitutional convention of 1867 and &#39;68 consisted of 131 scalawags, 
37 Negroes, nine carpetbaggers and twelve conservative whites. The convention that 
prepared the new constitution for Virginia was composed of 24 Negroes, 26 carpetbaggers,
14 scalawags and 35 conservative whites. 
</p>
<p>I ask them, when they indict these states for perpetrating a fraud by not placing 
certain provisions in their constitutions until after readmissions had been accomplished, 
and then turning around as they said and enacting mixed school law, if a fraud was 
perpetrated, who was the perpetrator? </p>
<p>We should remember also in this indictment against the southern states that 
governors were sent in as importations from as far away as Maine, Kansas and 
Pennsylvania, and those governors recommended to the very legislatures which 
ratified the Fourteenth Amendment that a school system should be established on 
a segregated basis. They did that because they understood the facts of life and 
knew that in no other way could that question then, as we maintain now, be 
solved to the benefit of both races.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF <br />
THURGOOD MARSHALL, ESQ., ON <br />
BEHALF OF APPELLANTS, HARRY BRIGGS, JR., ET AL. </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>There are several points I would like to clear up preliminarily, and then I would 
like to make sure that our position is correctly stated, and as it relates to statements 
made by counsel on the other side. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Mr. Marshall, I do not want to interrupt your closing 
argument, but I hope before you sit down you will state to the Court whether you 
have anything more to say on the question of remedies. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: In case you should prevail, more than is contained in 
your brief. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: Yes, sir, I would be glad to get to that first, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
</p>
<p>In our brief we found ourselves, after having given as much research as we could, 
in a position where we intelligently could not put forth a plan. We find that in 
the briefs of the other side they recognized there would be certain administrative 
problems involved, and anything else that they mentioned we, of course, —well, not 
of course—we do not recognize as being valid for this Court to consider. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we spent as much time as we could during the time of filing 
and the present time on the United States Government&#39;s suggestion as to the decree, and so far as we are concerned, it appears to us that there are administrative problems, there would be administrative 
problems, and that the decree of this Court could very well instruct the lower court 
to take into consideration that factor, and, if necessary, give to the state involved
a sufficient time to meet the administrative problems, with the understanding 
so far as we are concerned that I do not agree with the last part of the Government 
brief, that if it isn&#39;t done within a school year, that they could get more time 
for this reason, sir. </p>
<p>I can conceive of nothing administrative-wise that would take longer than a year. 
If they don&#39;t have staff enough to do then administrative things, the sovereign 
states can hire more people to do it. So for that reason I don&#39;t think it should take more 
than a year for them to adequately handle the administrative techniques, and I submit 
that a longer period of time would get the lower court into the legislative field 
as to whether or not to do it this way or that way. </p>
<p>Specifically, I am a firm believer that, especially insofar as the federal courts 
are concerned, their duty and responsibility ends with telling the state, in this 
field at least, what you can&#39;t do. And I don&#39;t think anybody is recommending to 
this Court that this Court take over the administrative job. Obviously, that is 
not recommended by anyone. So, with that, I think that is our position. </p>
<p>We said in the opening brief that if any plans were put forth, we would be obliged 
to do it, we wanted to do it, and that is our position on the limited point. It 
gets me, if it please the Court, to one of the points that runs throughout the argument 
in the brief on the other side, and that is that they deny that there is any race 
prejudice involved in these cases. They deny that there is any intention to discriminate. But throughout the brief and throughout the argument they not 
only recognize that there is a race problem involved, but they emphasize that that 
is the whole problem. And for the life of me, you can&#39;t read the debates, even the 
sections they rely on, without an understanding that the Fourteenth Amendment
took away from the states the power to use race. </p>
<p>As I understand their position, their only justification for this being a reasonable 
classification is, one, that they got together and decided that it is best for the 
races to be separated, and, two, that it has existed for over a century. Neither 
argument, to my mind, is any good. </p>
<p>The answer to the first argument is in two places, if I may for a moment address 
myself to it. This one that Mr. Davis and Mr. Moore both relied on, these horrible 
Census figures, the horrible number of Negroes in the South-and I thought at some 
stage it would be recognized by them that it shows that in truth and in fact in 
this country that high percentage of Negroes they talk about can be used to demonstrate 
to the world that, insofar as this country is concerned, two-thirds of the Negroes are compelled to submit to segregation.
</p>
<p>They say that is the reason for it. The best answer is in the record in the Clarendon 
County case, where the only witness the other side put on on this point—and a reading 
of it will show he was put on for the express purpose—he is a school administrator—of 
explaining how the school system would be operated under the new bill that was going 
to tax people; but they dragged this other point in and made him an expert in race 
relations and everything else. He emphasized—well, the best way to do it is this way, on page 119 of the 
record in the Briggs case: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What I was saying is that the problem of the mixed groups and racial tensions 
is less in communities where the minority population is small. That has been true 
of the testimony I have heard. </p>
  <p><b>Then the question</b>: `Well, Mr. Crow,&#39; incidentally, that was his name, Mr. Crow, &#39;assuming that in Clarendon County, especially in School District No. 22, the population 
was 95 percent white and 5 percent Negro, would that change your opinion?&#39; 
  </p>
  <p>Answer. No. </p>
  <p>Question. Then that is not really the basis of your opinion, is it? </p>
  <p>Answer. The question that you have asked me is in my opinion, will the elimination 
of segregation be fraught with undesirable results, and I have said that I thought it would. That may not be stating your question 
exactly, but that is still my answer. </p>
  <p>Question. As a matter of fact, Mr. Crow, isn&#39;t your opinion, based on the fact 
that you have all of your life believed in segregation of the races? Isn&#39;t that 
the reason, the real reason, the basis of your opinion? </p>
  <p>Answer. That wouldn&#39;t be all. </p>
  <p>Question. But it is a part of it? </p>
  <p>Answer. I suppose 
it is. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that answers all of those arguments about this large number of people involved. They are all American citizens who, by accident of birth, are a different color, and it makes no difference one way or another 
insofar as this Court is concerned. </p>
<p>Then, in that same vein, Attorney General Almond gets to the name-calling stage 
about these state conventions. Well, let&#39;s go up to the later convention in his 
State of Virginia. I don&#39;t believe that the man I am now going to quote can be characterized 
as anything but a respected former Senator of the United States, and in debating
the section in the latter Constitution of Virginia, not the one in this period 
but the later one, Senator Carter Glass, who was a delegate to the convention, spoke thusly in the debates: 
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Discrimination, that is precisely what we propose. That exactly is what this Convention was elected for, to discriminate to the 
very extremity of permissible action under the limitations of the Federal Constitution. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is quoted in the statement of jurisdiction in the Virginia case on page 
eleven. And another answer, I submit, is quoted in our reply brief involving the 
University of North Carolina Law School case, which was decided adversely to the 
Negro applicants in the district court, and on appeal to the Fourth Circuit Court 
of Appeals, the very Circuit that is involved here, in an opinion by Judge Soper of Maryland 
met this question of what we are doing is for the benefit of the white and Negro 
people alike, saying: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The defense seeks in part to avoid the charge of inequality by the paternal suggestion 
that it would be beneficial to the colored race in North Carolina as a whole, and 
to the individual plaintiffs in particular, if they would cooperate in promoting the policy adopted by the State rather than seek the best legal 
education which the State provides. The duty of the federal courts, however, is clear. 
We must give first place to the rights of the individual citizen, and when and where 
he seeks only equality of treatment before the law, his suit must prevail. It is 
for him to decide in which direction his advantage lies. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to this time of how long segregation has been in existence in the South, the 
same argument has been made in every case that has come up to this Court, the argument 
of stare decisis; that you should leave this because it has been longstanding, the 
&quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, and that there are so many states involved, was made 
in even more detailed fashion in the Sweatt brief filed by Attorney General Price 
Daniel; and, as an aside, it is significant that in the Virginia brief on the last page they go out of their way to pay acknowledgment 
to that brief filed by the Attorney General, which was obviously discarded by this 
Court. </p>
<p>There is not one new item that has been produced in all of these cases. And 
we come to the question as to whether or not the wishes of these states shall 
prevail, as to whether or not our Constitution shall prevail. And over against the public policy of the State of Virginia and 
the State of South Carolina is an Amendment that was put in the Constitution after one of the worst wars that was ever fought, 
and around that constitutional provision we say that the public policy of the 
United States does not look to the state policy, but looks to our Government. </p>
<p>And in the brief we have filed in our reply brief, we quote from a document which 
just came out—at least we just got ahold of it a couple of weeks ago, monograph—which 
we cite in our brief from the Selective Service of our Government, and we have some 
quotes in our brief. I don&#39;t emphasize or urge the quotes as such, but a reading 
of that monograph will convince anyone that the discriminatory segregation policies, 
education and otherwise, in the South almost caused us to lose one war, and I gather 
from the recommendations made in there that unless it is corrected we will lose 
another. </p>
<p>Now, that is the policy that I understand them to say that it is just a little 
feeling on the part of Negroes: They don&#39;t like segregation. As Mr. Davis said yesterday, the only thing the Negroes are trying to get is 
prestige. Exactly correct. Ever since the Emancipation Proclamation, the Negro has been trying to get what was recognized in Strauder 
v. West Virginia, which is the same status as anybody else regardless of race. </p>
<p>I can&#39;t for the life of me—it seems to me they recommend to us what we should 
do. It seems to me they should show some effort on their part to conform their states to the clear intent of past decisions. 
For example, the argument was made in McLaurin and Sweatt of what would happen if 
these decisions were granted, and indeed the brief, joint brief filed by the Attorneys 
General of all the states—and I remember correctly, it was signed by General Almond—said 
that if this Court broke down exclusion and segregation in the graduate and professional schools, or maybe it was the law schools—I know 
exactly what they said—the schools would have to close up and go out of business. 
And the truth of the matter—and we cite in our record the figures that show that since that decision there are 
now 1500 Negroes in graduate and professional schools in heretofore all white universities, 
1500 at least in twelve states, one of the states significantly out of the group 
being South Carolina. It is also pointed out in our brief a very long list of private
schools in the South which as a result, with no legal binding upon them at all, 
do so. </p>
<p>It is also significant that in states like Arkansas—I could name four or five—without 
any lawsuit, segregation was broken down. The truth of the matter is that I for 
one have more confidence in the people of the South, white and colored, than the lawyers on the other side. I am convinced they are just as lawful as anybody else, and 
once the law is laid down, that is all there is to it. </p>
<p>In their argument on the congressional debate, they do a 
job too well. They say no education was intended to be covered by the Fourteenth 
Amendment. Obviously, that is not correct, because even their pet case, Plessy v. 
Ferguson, recognized that education was under the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p>Then Mr. Moore goes to great detail to point out that the Fourteenth Amendment 
could go no further than the Civil Rights Act, and he emphasized yesterday and he 
emphasized today that, in addition to that, there were some rights that were deliberately 
excluded. His language is &quot;clearly eliminated,&quot; and then he says, &quot;Suffrage was 
clearly not intended to be included.&quot; </p>
<p>And how anyone can stand in this Court, having read the opinion of Mr. Justice 
Holmes in the first Texas Primary ease, and take that position is beyond me, because 
that decision, in the language of Mr. Justice Holmes, said specifically that they 
urged the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, but we don&#39;t have to get to the Fifteenth 
Amendment because the Fourteenth Amendment said that the states can do a lot of classifying which we, speaking as a Court, 
can&#39;t seem to understand, but it is clear that race cannot be used in suffrage. 
So I don&#39;t see the purport of any of that argument. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Do you think the Fifteenth Amendment was redundant, 
superfluous? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: No, sir, definitely not. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: So if it had not been there, it would have been included 
in the Fourteenth? </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: I think definitely, under the reasoning of Mr. Justice Holmes, 
it would have been. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is superfluous; then it is an extra. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: It is an extra. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: An extra. </p>
<p><b>MR. MARSHALL</b>: I just—maybe it is timidity, but I just can&#39;t say a constitutional 
amendment is superfluous; but if you are asking me if I think Mr. Justice Holmes was absolutely correct, definitely, yes, sir. </p>
<p>That brings me to the other point which I want to make clear. It involves the 
questions yesterday about our position as to the McLaurin case, and I am a little 
worried in thinking of what I said yesterday as to whether the position was absolutely 
clear. And it is suggested today that the position we take in this case is a negation 
of the McLaurin case, and as to whether or not the McLaurin case is a negation of 
the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine, and it is argued that McLaurin had a constitutional grievance, because he was denied equality; 
but in the McLaurin case the answer is that the only inequality which he suffered 
is that which is inherent—emphasis on &quot;inherent,&quot; if you please—in segregation itself. </p>
<p>He had the same schools, same everything else, but he had this segregation; so 
that is inherent. And if McLaurin won because he was denied equality, it is also true and much more important that he suffered constitutional inequality in the enjoyment of these identical 
offerings. </p>
<p>And it follows that with education, this Court has made segregation and inequality equivalent concepts. They have equal rating, equal footing, and if segregation thus necessarily imports inequality, it makes no great difference whether we say that the Negro is wronged because he is segregated, or that he is wronged because he received unequal treatment. </p>
<p>We believe that what we really ask this Court is to make explicit what they think was inevitably implicit in the McLaurin case, that the two are 
together. But most certainly I do not agree, and I want to make it clear, that the 
McLaurin case is under the one-way, and I think that with this understanding the 
Court has no difficulty in our position at least. </p>
<p>And finally, I would like to say that each lawyer on the other side has made 
it clear as to what the position of the state was on this, and it would be all right 
possibly, but for the fact that this is so crucial. There is no way you can repay 
lost school years. These children in these cases are guaranteed by the states some 
twelve years of education in varying degrees, and this idea, if I understand it, to leave it to the states until they work it out—and I think that is a most 
ingenious argument—you leave it to the states, they say; and then they say that 
the states haven&#39;t done anything about it in a hundred years, so for that reason 
this Court doesn&#39;t touch it. </p>
<p>The argument of judicial restraint has no application in this case. There is 
a relationship between Federal and State, but there is no corollary or relationship 
as to the Fourteenth Amendment. The duty of enforcing, the duty of following the 
Fourteenth Amendment is placed upon the states. The duty of enforcing the Fourteenth 
Amendment is placed upon this Court, and the argument that they make over and over again to my mind is the same type of argument they 
charge us with making, the same argument Charles Sumner made. Possibly so. </p>
<p>And we hereby charge them with making the same argument that was made before 
the Civil War, the same argument that was made during the period before the Civil 
War, the same argument that was made during the period between the ratification 
of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Plessy v. Ferguson case. </p>
<p>And I think it makes no progress for us to find out who made what argument. It 
is our position that, whether or not you base this case solely on the intent of 
Congress, or whether you base it on the logical extension of the doctrine as set 
forth in the McLaurin case, on either basis the same conclusion is required, which is that this Court 
makes it clear to all of these states that in administering their governmental functions, at least those that are vital not to the life of 
the state alone, not to the country alone, but vital to the world in general, that little pet feelings of race, little pet feelings 
of custom—I got the feeling yesterday that when you put a white child in a school 
with a whole lot of colored children, the child would fall apart or something. Everybody 
knows that is not true. Those same kids in Virginia and South Carolina—and I have 
seen them do it—they play in the streets together, they play on their farms together, 
they go down the road together, they separate to go to school, they come out of school and play ball together. They have to be separated in school. </p>
<p>There is some magic to it. You can have them voting together, you can have them not restricted because of law in the houses they live in. You 
can have them going to the same state university and the same college; but if they 
go to elementary and high school the world will fall apart. And it is the exact 
same argument that has been made to this Court over and over again, and we submit 
that when they charge us with making a legislative argument, it is in truth they 
who are making the legislative argument. </p>
<p>They can&#39;t take race out of this case. From the day this case was filed until 
this moment, nobody has in any form or fashion, despite the fact I made it clear 
in the opening argument that I was relying on it, done anything to distinguish this 
statute from the Black Codes, which they must admit, because nobody can dispute,
say anything anybody wants to say one way or the other, the Fourteenth Amendment 
was intended to deprive the states of the power to enforce Black Codes or anything 
else like it. We charge that they are Black Codes. They obviously are Black Codes 
if you read them. They haven&#39;t denied that they are Black Codes, so if the Court 
wants to very narrowly decide this case, they can decide it on that point. 
</p>
<p>So whichever way it is done, the only way that this Court can decide this 
case in opposition to our position is that there must be some reason which gives 
the state the right to make a classification that they can make in regard to nothing else in regard to Negroes; and we submit the only way to arrive at this decision is to find that for some 
reason Negroes are inferior to all other human beings. Nobody will stand in the 
Court and urge that, and in order to arrive at the decision that they want us to arrive at, there would have to 
be some recognition of a reason why, of all of the multitudinous groups of people 
in this country, you have to single out Negroes and give them this separate treatment.
</p>
<p>It can&#39;t be because of slavery in the past, because there are very few groups 
in this country that haven&#39;t had slavery some place back in the history of their 
groups. It can&#39;t be color because there are Negroes as white as the drifted snow, 
with blue eyes, and they are just as segregated as the colored man. The only thing 
can be is an inherent determination that the people who were formerly in slavery, 
regardless of anything else, shall be kept as near that stage as is possible; and 
now is the time, we submit, that this Court should make it clear that that is not 
what our Constitution stands for. </p>
<p>Thank you, sir. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Mr. Rankin? </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OF J. LEE RANKIN, ESQ., <br />
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, <br />
AS AMICUS CURIAE </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>As this Court well knows, the United States appears in this action as a friend 
of the Court, and the only excuse for us to be here is because of the assistance 
that we may be able to give the Court in regard to this problem before it. </p>
<p>When these questions were asked by the Court as a part of the request for reargument 
in this matter, we approached them with the idea of how much we might be able to 
help the Court in answering the questions, and we felt it incumbent upon us in the 
Department of Justice to try to arrive at the truth in the background and the history as the Court inquired for it. And we saw it as our duty to approach 
that history much as historians would, and try to draw from it the facts just as 
objectively as any party could on either side, for someone who had no personal interest 
in the case. That was the approach that we made to this case in trying to help the Court in the answer of these questions. </p>
<p>We have been chided because we did not come forth in our brief in answer to the 
questions with certain history. We did not conceive it as our duty to develop any 
history. We thought it our duty to present what the history showed, whether it hurt 
or helped either side. </p>
<p>We have no apology to Your Honors or to the country for the manner in which we 
have developed the history involved in this case and the Fourteenth Amendment; and, 
on behalf of the Attorney General and myself personally, I want to express publicly my 
appreciation for the work that was done, as some of you 
well know, by others and myself on this, in order to present a factual history of 
the entire matter that the Court could rely on and not have to do independent work 
in regard to it. </p>
<p>But these questions were not in vain. There are great lessons that can be drawn 
from them, and they are important to this Court in helping them to decide this, 
one of the greatest cases that this Court has had before it. Why do these questions 
seem important? Because they clean out some of the unimportant elements, some of 
the claims that cannot be sustained by history, and leave the Court with the naked 
problems of what this Amendment means to every American citizen who loves this country 
and this Constitution. </p>
<p>Many claims have been made in these cases about the acts of Congress, and the 
only way to determine the validity of those claims is to look at what Congress did, 
what was said about them, and we have rejected masses of material and tried to boil 
it down. I apologize for the size of the work we left for the Court, but it is the 
best we could do, and we tried to eliminate all we could. However, in looking at 
what happened, we have tried to follow the standards this Court has laid down in 
many decisions—Maxwell v. Dow is one of them—in which the Court would not pick out an isolated remark, 
part of debates, something of the opponents or the proponents, in connection with a certain piece of legislation, and even that rule did not apply in constitutional matters. And we have rejected 
purposely those various statements, but pointed them out to the Court so the Court 
could consider them for what they are worth. </p>
<p>But we say, when Congress considered the question of segregation in the schools in the debates that extended over a period of months in this matter, 
that you cannot rely on those statements as showing that Congress decided this particular 
question before the Court. They are too sketchy under the rules laid down by this 
Court to rely on. There we get to the middle of the road. We are not satisfactory 
to either side. We turn up with conclusions that the evidence does not sustain the 
plaintiff&#39;s position nor the position of the states. But regardless of who it hurts, it is there and it cannot be overlooked.
</p>
<p>Now to deal directly with a few of these problems, let us look at what happened 
in the District of Columbia, and on its face the fact that two enactments were passed 
by the same 39th Congress dealing with this question of schools and separate schools 
in the District might seem of grave importance as to the interpretation by Congress. 
But we show you what happened. We show the consideration or lack of it that Congress gave to that particular problem. </p>
<p>The separate schools question was considered by Congress back in 1862. The 39th 
Congress considered only two things. One was whether to give three lots for the 
use of the colored schools in the District, and the other was to allocate certain 
funds. There were no committee reports, no participation by the members of the Reconstruction 
Committee. There was no debate, and we show you on page 71 in the supplement to 
our brief the detail of the material that Congress considered on the same day.
</p>
<p>Now gentlemen, with your experience I am sure that Your Honors know that in this 
particular instance the history is of great help to this Court, because it does 
not show that Congress determined at that time that segregation should be continued as the policy under the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution. Congress just did not consider that matter, and they 
did not have time for it, and it wasn&#39;t the way that those matters are determined
by Congress as we well know, and the things that this Court considers in regard 
to it. </p>
<p>In addition to that, we must keep in mind, as the Court well knows in connection 
with the Thompson case, that at that time Congress did not have the same responsibility 
in the administration and conduct of the District of Columbia that it has today; that it had its own 
government; and it wasn&#39;t until 1871 that the change was made where Congress undertook 
the detailed supervision of the District. </p>
<p>So we are saying that that event in itself doesn&#39;t show the Congress understood 
that the Fourteenth Amendment was to permit segregation in the schools of this nation. Then we turn to the action of the 
states. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Before you do that, Mr. Attorney General, I suppose you would say that the action since 1871 is too ex post facto 
to be relevant. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Very largely, Your Honor. It all is removed from the scene. Changes 
have occurred in Congress over the years. The framers were not participants in most 
of that action, and the Fourteenth Amendment was not involved in those questions. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: But it could in any event be involved; but I think, 
so far as any inference is to be drawn from what Congress did or did not do, the 
early legislation, you put to one side for the reason that you have given. That 
would be significant because Congress was then contemporaneous; it was the same Congress about the 
same time as those that submitted the Fourteenth Amendment. But since 1871 Congress 
has continued to pass legislation year after year acknowledging or authorizing—which is it—acknowledging or authorizing segregation in 
the District, both. Whatever it is, there have been appropriations recognizing the fact of segregation, and such has been the policy of the District; is that 
correct? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: To this day. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: From 1871, when Congress had sole charge, you would 
say we can&#39;t attribute constitutional verification to Congress passing the appropriations 
act. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That is correct. That is our position. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: I understood you to attribute it to after 1896. What about 
the period from 1866 until &#39;96, where the question hadn&#39;t been raised, where they went ahead and appropriated for the District schools 
which had segregation? Does that give any indication to you of the attitude of the 
Congress or the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: We don&#39;t consider that there is anything to show that that was an 
interpretation with knowledge as required by the opinions of this Court in the past 
concerning the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment with regard to segregation in 
the schools in the District or anyplace else. </p>
<p>When you go back into the— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: What about the 1875 Act? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: When you go into the history of the 1875 Act, as we have set out 
in detail, the consideration before Congress was whether or not the law would be 
passed with a provision for mixed schools or with an amendment that was offered 
for separate and equal. Both of them lost. How you can possibly draw any inference
from such action that one side won that contest rather than the other is what 
we cannot follow. We think that Congress, by not enacting separate and equal, and 
failing to enact for mixed schools, left the question in abeyance as far as that 
particular action is concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Or left it to the states. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: No, I think it left it to the Fourteenth Amendment, which had already been passed by the Congress and ratified by the states, and 
it was appreciated at that time that this Court would have the problem to protect 
those rights as they were declared in section 1. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: The Fourteenth Amendment, in the light of the history that 
had gone on from 1866 to 1875— </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, that history as we saw it— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: I mean the history of the states. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, the history of the states, if the Court will look— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: You are coming to that next? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes, we will look 
into that picture. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Before you go into that, isn&#39;t the one thing that is perfectly 
clear under the Fourteenth Amendment that Congress is given the power and the duty 
to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment by legislation? You don&#39;t disagree with that, do you? You believe that, 
don&#39;t you? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: No, there is no question but— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: And the other thing that is clear is that they have never 
done, have never enacted an act that deals with this subject. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: There is no question but what Congress has the power under section 
5 to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: And if the Amendment reaches segregation, they have the power to enforce it and set up machinery to make it effective. 
There is no doubt about that, is there, and it hasn&#39;t been done. Now, if our representative 
institutions have failed—is that the point? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: No, because this Court has, in our understanding, concurrent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Have you taken it over? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: No. You both have a responsibility, and neither one can give that 
responsibility up to the other, in our conception. There is a concurrent responsibility, 
and the Court has recognized it in numerous cases where it has interpreted and applied 
the Fourteenth Amendment. It has not waited for Congress to act under section 5, but it has 
looked at section 1 and the other sections of the Amendment to see what they meant, 
and the force of that language that was used at that time in adopting the intention and purpose of the framers 
as expressed, and tried to give a liberal interpretation to carry out the purposes 
that were pervading in the passing of the Amendment. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: I suppose that realistically the reason <a name="page27">
</a>this case is here was that action couldn&#39;t be obtained from 
Congress. Certainly it would be here much stronger, from your point of view, if Congress 
did act, wouldn&#39;t it? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That is true, but there are many cases that the Court well recognized, 
I know, upon any reflection, and has in its opinions, that if the Court would delegate 
back to Congress from time to time the question of deciding what should be done 
about the rights, the constitutional rights of a party appearing before this Court 
for relief, the parties would be deprived by that procedure from getting their constitutional rights because of the present membership or 
approach of Congress to that particular question. And the whole concept of constitutional 
law is that those rights that are defined and set out in the Constitution are not 
to be subject to the political form which changes from time to time, but are to be preserved 
under the holdings of this Court over many, many years by the orders of this Court 
granting the relief prayed for. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: The thing to be said—or is it to be said fairly?—that 
not only did Congress not exercise the power under section 5 with reference to the 
states, but in a realm which is its exclusive authority, it enacted legislation 
to the contrary. </p>
<p>Now, I understand the argument that from 1871 to date you do not get that which 
has contemporaneous significance; but it does indicate—or does it indicate; I ask 
you that—any understanding on the part of successive congresses that segregation was not ruled out by the 
Constitution, not the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p>I take it that whatever you have to say about the District you will be saying 
during this hour? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: The Fourteenth Amendment apart, which does not bind 
the Federal Government, of course, but whatever is to be drawn out of the Fifth 
Amendment through the action of Congress for what is now eighty years has contradicted
the assumption that the Fourteenth Amendment, as reflected by the due process 
of the Fifth, bars such action. 
</p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, we—think that the action regarding the District back in 1862, when the Amendment was before the 39th Congress, does not give any bearing upon the action in adopting the Fourteenth Amendment.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I understand that. Because after all, what precedes, 
as Justice Bradley said in the <i>Legal Tender Cases</i>, when we got that Amendment and the antecedent—but it does seem to be underlying some implicit belief on all the congresses from 1871, that such legislation does not contravene the deepest presuppositions 
of our Constitution, or am I overstating what that means, or are you saying that 
legislation does not mean anything but what it does; it just segregates, that is 
all? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, not exactly. It seems that you have to find a conscious determination 
by Congress that segregation was permitted under the Fourteenth Amendment. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: You think legislation by Congress is like the British Empire, something that is acquired in a fit of absentmindedness?
</p>
<p>[Laughter.] </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: I couldn&#39;t make that charge before this Court, and I wouldn&#39;t want 
to be quoted in that manner. There might be times that that occurred, but I think 
Congress is well aware that when that does happen, the subject matter does not deserve 
greater consideration than it has at the moment, and that it is ordinarily pretty well taken care of under the processes. With regard to the entire question, 
it seems that there should be another factor that the Court should consider in this 
matter. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Are you going to discuss later the action of the states?
</p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes. I will proceed now to the question of the legislation of the states in regard to this matter. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: The issue of the states, the seceding states? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes. </p>
<p>In the ratification of the Amendment and the readmission of the seceding states, 
much is assumed in connection with that by the parties. We find that the evidence, 
the record of history, does not sustain that. There were no references to the Fourteenth 
Amendment and its effect, and the history of the times shows why there were not.
</p>
<p>We must look back to that period and recognize the condition of the entire country, and particularly the South, that had just been occupied, 
was in the process of occupation; the condition of the Negroes who were entirely illiterate, but were freedmen, and the problem of what to do about their education; and the many things dealing 
with them in the situation where they had just been slaves. We must remember the 
condition of education throughout the North. It was far different than the progress 
that has been made up to this day. And that in the South there were very few public 
schools. The public schools were largely for the poor, and other people went to the private schools, and 
there was a prohibition against the Negro going to any school because it might make 
him rebellious. </p>
<p>Now, when you take all of that into account and consider what happened at that 
time, it seems to us that it is very revealing, but you can&#39;t draw any conclusions 
from that legislation that there was any conscious understanding that the Fourteenth 
Amendment provided or permitted segregation in the public schools. </p>
<p>A perfect example is shown in the appendix to our brief on page 352, where we 
set out the history about South Carolina. There was a State where reconstructionists, 
scalawags, the Radical Republicans, carpetbaggers, and all of the others that have 
been remarked about here, had control of the convention that ratified this Amendment. 
And you recall the circumstances. They had to do certain things, three things in 
order to get back into the Union. </p>
<p>Now, arguments were made at great length about the terms of the Constitution 
for the State of South Carolina, and during those arguments much was said about 
the schools, and the facts were that the Negroes had taken over the public schools, 
such as they were, in the important cities at that time in South Carolina, and had 
them in their possession, to try to teach the Negroes something, because they had to start from scratch. And during those debates, when the question 
was presented about whether they should have mixed schools or separate schools, 
nothing was said about the effect of the Fourteenth Amendment, although it was provided 
in the Constitution that there could be no distinction in the schools based upon 
race or color. </p>
<p>Now, that is in a convention that was under complete control of the Reconstruction 
forces, and we say from that you just cannot properly say that the history shows that anyone had any conscious understanding at the time those various acts were passed that the Fourteenth 
Amendment would permit segregation in public schools. It just wasn&#39;t there, because in those debates, as shown in the appendix 
again, all they would have had to say was, &quot;Look at the Fourteenth Amendment; it 
prohibits this very thing.&quot; </p>
<p>Instead of that, one of the parties who was in control of the schools actively 
trying to get education for the Negroes said, &quot;Maybe the Negroes will attend the same schools as the whites, or the whites will come 
into the schools of the Negroes now in our possession.&quot; Nobody saw fit to say anything about the effect of the Fourteenth Amendment.
</p>
<p>Now, if you will look back at the history of the schools in the North and 
also throughout the South, you will see that everybody was involved in the 
problem of, &quot;What are we going to do to educate the Negro? He is a free man, he is a part of our citizenry like 
any white man. He has no background for education. Many of them are of mature 
years, as well as the children.&quot; And they were so involved in that problem that 
the effect of the Fourteenth Amendment and whether it permitted or would allow 
segregation in the public schools was just not discussed by anyone. And I don&#39;t 
think you can draw from that any assumption that by those legislative acts, when 
there was not any discussion of the problem, that it was intended or understood 
by anyone that the Fourteenth Amendment would permit, in spite of its language, 
segregation of the Negro in the public schools.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Mr. Rankin, I would like to ask you this: You have studied 
this much more than I have had a chance to, and I almost hesitate to ask a question 
in a case of this kind because people jump to the assumption that if you want information it is stating a judgment that I have. 
</p>
<p>How do you account for the decisions of the State of New York, for example, holding 
the Amendment did not reach this question, when there was a State where there was 
no problem of numbers—there were few Negroes—the court that last decided this was 
predominantly a Republican court, predominantly from upstate New York, where the 
underground railway had plenty of stations, all kinds of things to fight the war, 
a popular war? How do you account for judges like that not understanding what this 
Amendment meant? The very section that promulgated it—it was a northern product, 
there was no getting away from that. You studied the history of this a great deal. How do you account for those interpretations?
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: May I ask this question before you answer that, also the question 
of the legislatures of the northern states on the Amendment, the same legislatures 
in some instances passed legislation which recognized segregation, allowed segregation 
amendments? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, first if I might answer in regard to the courts, apparently 
there was no detailed study of the history and background of the Fourteenth Amendment in connection with some of the decisions of the cases.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: You can&#39;t say that of the New York case. It is one of the—
</p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: And the Court will find that in later periods there was reliance 
placed upon Plessy against Ferguson and some of the earlier cases where the history 
was not reviewed in such detail; that will explain fully the decisions that the 
court made without examining the question in detail. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: These men had lived with the thing. 
They didn&#39;t have to go to books. They had been through it. They didn&#39;t have to go 
to books any more than we have to read books on what is going on today— </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, if the Court is looking— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: And the Grand Army of the Republic was the strongest force 
in that community, don&#39;t make any mistake about that. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: If the Court is looking for someone who knew, who lived through the 
period, to give it aid in regard to this problem, I think it has to look no further than its own decisions; and going back to the 
Slaughter-House Cases and the Strauder case, Justice Miller comments upon the fact 
in the Slaughter-House Cases that it was within five years of the time when all 
of this occurred and that they had the matter fresh in their minds; and then he reviews the background, 
the history and the detail and the reasons for the Amendment and what they were trying to reach in the greatest of detail; 
and we recommended to the Court something superior to anything else that can be 
found with regard to a fresh appraisal of the basis for the Fourteenth Amendment 
and the history back of it. </p>
<p>In the Strauder cases we have a later period, but we do have a period not too 
far removed, and a thorough consideration of what the Fourteenth Amendment means 
in all of its various reaches. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Then the assumption is that they didn&#39;t understand what 
it was about? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, in those days— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: That is what it comes to, isn&#39;t it? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: It was considered that education as such was a state matter, and 
we had the question of whether schools would be provided as public schools. We also 
had a good portion of the problem handled by private schools. We had areas where 
there were mixed separate schools and also where there was no restriction on attendance, and the two races did mix, but there was no provision legally 
for such mixture. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: So the very men that sat on the Plessy-Ferguson case on this Court were thoroughly familiar with all the history in that case.
</p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, the Court in that case was not giving any consideration to 
this particular situation. It was considering the question of segregation in public 
utilities and railroads. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: That is the difference, isn&#39;t it? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: There is a very material difference in the question of whether or 
not segregation is to be permitted in public schools furnished by the state itself 
and the monies of the state, although this Court has recognized that that may be 
and is a privilege, but that the state has no power to restrict that privilege based 
upon race in regard to the schools. If it is going to provide education at all, 
it must provide it equally to the citizens. It does not have to provide education, 
and to that extent it is a privilege; but if it provides it at all, it must do it equally to all citizens. </p>
<p>Apparently that was not fully understood, the difference between it being privileged and the later decisions of this Court in regard to the requirement 
that even such a privilege had to be granted to citizens alike; but we think that 
question is now decided by this Court, that it cannot be contravened at this time.
</p>
<p>Regarding the question of the power of the Court, we do not think this is a matter 
that involves the right to abolish segregation in the public schools. It is a question 
whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment permits the state to determine that it shall have segregation as an 
order of the state in the conduct of its public education, and that, we think, is within the peculiar competency of this Court to determine. </p>
<p>It is a civil right to have education on the same basis as every other citizen. 
When Congress deals with these matters, it must deal with them generally, and the 
courts deal with them specifically. The courts deal with whether or not a certain litigant before it is entitled 
to relief, has not been permitted to have the rights he was entitled to by the wording 
of the Constitution, and this Court has never seen fit to determine that a man has 
been denied his constitutional rights and then referred him to Congress to see what 
type of relief he should be granted from it. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS</b>: The Department of Justice goes no further than to say that, 
first, we can decide this case, these cases, and second, we can decide them under 
what, on the basis of history? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: No, Your Honor, no. Our position is that the history helps the Court in showing that some of the conclusions that have been asserted 
from history are not borne out. The history as related by the Slaughter-House Cases 
and the Strauder case is the history that the Department of Justice found to be 
correct in its review of the entire matter. That by reason of that history it is 
shown that the pervading purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to establish that 
all men are equal, that they are equal before the law, that they are entitled to 
equal protection of the law, that no distinction can ever be made on the basis of race or 
color; and that therefore this Court, in applying the rules it has laid down in 
many cases looking to that pervading purpose, can find only one answer to this case, 
and that is, when they stand before the bar of this Court and say that &quot;The reason 
that we want to segregate black children from white children is because of racism, 
just because of their color,&quot; that the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit that to happen, 
because if there was anything the Fourteenth Amendment tried to do for this country, it was to make it clear that no discrimination 
could ever be made based upon race or color; and that is the position of the Department 
of Justice in this matter. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: That is your third conclusion, on page 186 of your brief, 
isn&#39;t it? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes. </p>
<p>We think that the history is of great help to the Court in regard to the basic question of the rights of the parties, and this Court has the problem 
of deciding two things: first, whether or not the constitutional rights have been 
abridged, and we think that is clear. The history shows the pervading purpose.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS</b>: The provision that Justice Frankfurter referred to doesn&#39;t say that, in my opinion. I am just inquiring to find out 
what it says. You start on page 185; the Government brief reads as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>. . . the Government respectfully suggests to the Court that, if it holds school 
segregation to be unconstitutional, the public interest would be served by entering 
decrees in the instant cases providing in substance as follows: (1) That racial segregation in public 
schools be decreed by this Court to be a violation of rights secured by the Constitution.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would think that would be obvious, that if the Court holds segregation would 
be unconstitutional, that we would—and it was within the judicial competence, it 
would be within our duty to enter an appropriate decree to that effect. But my question 
went further than that. It was: What are the merits, whether the Department of Justice had taken a position? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes. I think Your Honor is correct in that regard, and the way I 
answered the question was due to the formulation of the question. But in order to 
answer your question specifically, it is the position of the Department of Justice 
that segregation in public schools cannot be maintained under the Fourteenth Amendment, and we adhere to the views expressed in the original brief of the Department 
in that regard. We did limit our brief in our— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS</b>: I just wanted to clear up that confusion in my mind. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: You say this is the kind of a question where you are 
responding to the inquiry of the Court as to what the form of the decree should 
be. The Department has already, in its prior brief and in this brief, if I can interpret the entire brief, made its position perfectly clear that it thinks segregation is outlawed by the Fourteenth Amendment, and on pages 186 and 187 you indicate 
the kind of a decree that should follow such a declaration, is that correct? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That is correct. The problem about the questions that the Court presented 
that gave us the greatest trouble was the question of relief. Because of the statements 
of the Court, there are a number of decisions that, when a person has had his constitutional
rights abridged, that he had a present and personal right to immediate relief.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Are you leaving the third question? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: I thought I had dealt with it, but I will be glad to try to answer 
any further questions. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: I did not quite understand what you were saying in regard to 
that. The third question is: On the assumption the answers to question 2(a) and 
(b) do not dispose of the issue, is it within the judicial power of the Fourteenth 
Amendment to abolish segregation? Now, that is saying that the argument over history is inconclusive, as I understand it. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That&#39;s right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Assuming that that is inconclusive, then does this Court through 
its own power have the right—is that the belief of the Government—have the power 
to declare segregation unconstitutional? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: The position of the Government is that the Court does have the power 
and that it has the duty. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Where do we get that power, and how? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: By reason of the power given to it under the Constitution and by act of Congress, and the— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: So far as the Fourteenth Amendment is 
concerned by the very words of the Fourteenth Amendment? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes, by reason of section 1, which says that &quot;These rights shall 
not be denied by any state,&quot; and in the interpretation of that language the Court, 
in applying it, has the right to find, and according to its decisions will find, 
that the parties are entitled to this. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Regardless of the view of Congress, regardless of the history of it, which you say is inconclusive, that the wording covers 
segregation? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: I think the best answer to that would be the history in regard to— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Is that what we are trying to determine now? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: It could very well be. That is what is striking to me: If you lay aside the history, lay aside what has happened, and the intention as expressed in Congress, then we have nothing left except 
the bare words. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That is correct. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: And those you say require the invalidation of all the laws of segregation? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes. And the Court has in other cases seen fit to examine the question 
and, not finding any specific language about, for instance, jury trials, has found 
that the Fourteenth Amendment would not permit any abridgment of those rights by 
reason of race or color. And this Court has said many times that it does not have 
to find that a particular matter or subject was examined by Congress. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: We have a statute on juries. Congress passed a statute on 
juries. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: So it is clear that Congress acted on that subject. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: We don&#39;t have any statute, as I recall, about petitions or freedom of speech; but this Court has not hesitated to protect the provisions 
of the Constitution and the litigants before this Court in regard to them; and the 
history also does show that the framers of this constitutional amendment desired 
to avoid having it submitted to Congress, and they recognized that they might 
lose control of the Congress in the future, and they wanted to frame their 
change deliberately, section 1, in order to make certain that it wouldn&#39;t be a question for Congress, because you will recall the history 
that we relate. </p>
<p>Originally, it was to empower Congress, in section 1, to take certain action; 
and they feared and they expressed the fear that Congress by that might change it 
and they would lose control, and they said maybe they can get a majority, but two-thirds 
they will never get; and so they provided the specific right in such a form that 
it was like the provisions of the Bill of Rights. It was a declaration of a right that every citizen can look to and say, &quot;That is mine, equality before 
the law.&quot; </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Which clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the first section is that applicable to, to any person within its jurisdiction, 
providing equal protection of the law? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: We think that there are two clauses that are controlling. One is the equal protection of the laws and the other is the depriving of any 
person of life, liberty or property without due process; both of them. Congress 
deliberately put the words so that no state could deny them. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: And is this a denial of liberty or property, segregation?
</p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, I would think it would be a denial of part of liberty rather 
than property. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: It has to be one or the other or both, doesn&#39;t it? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes, it could be a combination. </p>
<p>[Whereupon, at two o&#39;clock p.m., the Court recessed, to reconvene at two-thirty o&#39;clock p.m. the same day.] </p>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>AFTERNOON SESSION </b> </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><b>ARGUMENT OF J. LEE RANKIN, ESQ., <br />
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, <br />
AS AMICUS CURIAE—RESUMED </b> </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: May it please the Court: </p>
<p>I would like to deal briefly with the question of relief and try to give to the 
Court our points on that problem. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Which problem is that, you say? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: The question of relief. </p>
<p>After the Court determines whether or not rights have been violated in these 
cases, then there is the question of the relief that should be granted. We do not 
regard lightly the question of presenting to this Court a policy of delaying at all the relief that should be granted to 
citizens of this country when constitutional rights are found to have been violated, 
as we feel that they have been in this case. However, upon careful study of the 
entire problem, we do think there are considerations that we can recommend to this 
Court that should be taken into account in the decision of these cases. </p>
<p>These cases do not deal only with the particular plaintiffs. The Court knows 
that they deal with certain classes, in addition to these plaintiffs. But beyond 
that, we think it is fair to take into account the fact that the precedents established 
by the Court in the decision of these cases will necessarily bear upon the educational
systems of some seventeen states and the District of Columbia. There have to be adjustments to take care of the children attending these schools, and to provide them a program of mixed schools that will be adequate; 
and there will also have to be the problems of the administration and the various 
financial problems involved. It seems unrealistic not to take into account those 
factors, and that some time may be involved in providing for them. 
</p>
<p>We therefore suggest that it should be—the burden should be —upon the defendants 
to present and satisfy the lower court as to the extent of time that is necessary 
to make such an adjustment in the school system, and that plan should be presented 
to the Court, not for the purpose of determining at all the wisdom of the plan, 
but only to determine and satisfy that court that, according to criteria presented and set out by this Court, that the plan satisfies the constitutional 
requirements of our Constitution and its amendments. </p>
<p>We therefore recommend to the Court, although we do not think it is squarely 
in point, the history of the Court in regard to the American Tobacco case, and the 
possibility that this decree may lay out, at least in a measure, a plan for handling 
these cases in returning them to the lower courts for final disposition. We suggest 
a year for the presentation and consideration of a plan, not because that is an 
exact standard, but with the idea that it might involve the principle of handling 
the matter with deliberate speed. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Mr. Rankin, may I ask you a question or two about this remedy you suggest: We have no state before us, have we? We have several school districts. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes, that is correct. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: I suppose that, even if we said that the state statutes 
or state constitutional provisions authorizing segregation were unconstitutional, local custom would still perpetuate it in most districts of the states that really want it; I assume that would be 
the case, would it not? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: We do not assume that once this Court pronounces what the Constitution 
means in this area that our people are not going to try to abide by it and be in 
accord with it as rapidly as they can. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: I do not think a court can enter a decree on that assumption, particularly in view of the fact that for 75 years the &quot;separate 
but equal&quot; doctrine has prevailed in the cases that came before us within the recent 
past, indicating it still had not been complied with in many cases. The only people 
we can reach with the judicial decree are the people who are before us in the case.
</p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That is correct. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: So that if it is not acquiesced in and embraced, we have 
to proceed school district by school district; is that right? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, this Court traditionally handles each case as it comes before 
it. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Yes. It means that private litigation will result in every 
school district in order to get effective enforcement; and that is why, I suppose, this &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine has never really been enforced, because many disadvantaged people cannot afford 
these lawsuits. But the judicial remedy means just that, does it not, lawsuit after 
lawsuit? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, it is probably true in every Fourteenth Amendment case that 
comes before the Court, each litigant has to come and say, &quot;My rights have been 
infringed, and I have to be provided a remedy.&quot; </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: That is right; that is the nature of judicial process; that is why in some cases it has been necessary to set up something 
like the SEC to enforce individual rights in security transactions, and the Interstate Commerce Commission. </p>
<p>But what I do not get in your statement here are any criteria that we are to 
lay down to the lower court, in your view, to determine what shall be taken into consideration. Now, you mention the antitrust cases, 
but we have been fifty years in interpreting the antitrust cases in this Court, 
laying down the criteria, the standards. Some districts may have to have bond issues; some may 
have to submit to a vote; commissioners may resign; no 
commissioners would take the job—I wouldn&#39;t want it, to be caught between these forces. </p>
<p>What criteria are we going to lay down? I am all for having the district courts 
frame decrees and do all the rest of the work that we can put on them; but what 
are we going to tell them: &quot;This is something different from antitrust. This is 
something that hasn&#39;t been before&quot;? What are we going to do to avoid the situation 
where in some districts everybody is perhaps held in contempt almost immediately because that judge has that disposition, and in some other districts 
it is twelve years before they get to a hearing? What criteria do you propose?
</p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: If I may try to answer some of the questions that Your Honor— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: It is all one question: What are the standards? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: In the first place, I do not think the country would ever be satisfied 
with anybody but the Supreme Court saying what the Fourteenth Amendment means; and, 
secondly— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: We would not be, anyway. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: No. </p>
<p>[Laughter.] </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Secondly, I think that this Court does not have the duty or the function 
to try to determine what is a wise educational policy for each one of the various school districts in the country. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: I am with you there. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: It has the duty and the obligation to say that when the Constitution 
says that men shall be equal before the law, and the states shall regard them as 
equal in all of the various things that it does for them, that it cannot take one 
group of people and say, &quot;You shall be separated, just because of your color, from 
another group,&quot; and that is not equality. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: That leads you squarely to Mr. Marshall&#39;s position that they have the right; children are getting older, they get out of 
school before they get this right and therefore it should be done; and then you 
say there are some conditions that should postpone that. Now, what is to be taken, 
financial conditions, unwillingness of the community to vote funds? What are the conditions that the 
lower court should consider? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: I think that that problem will have to be tried, as these matters 
are constantly before the lower courts and the federal courts, in the determination as to whether or not the equities of the particular 
situation are such that the defendant has established the burden that it is unreasonable 
under those standards to require them to act more rapidly than they propose, and 
those standards are well-established as a part of our judicial process and experience,
and in the statements of this Court. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: I foresee a generation of litigation if we send it back 
with no standards, and each case has to come here to determine it standard by standard.
</p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, experience has demonstrated that the common law procedure of trying to decide each case as it comes before the court has been very wise in the experience of mankind, and many of the decisions, 
problems, are handled by the lower courts in the federal system, and never reach 
this Court for final decision. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Isn&#39;t there a difference between the applicable standard—it 
is one thing to talk about a standard—and another thing, the means by which this standard can be satisfied? This Court might decree that as between state and state, one state is maintaining 
a nuisance; but how a nuisance should be abated is a very different question.
</p>
<p>It does not bring into play what standards you apply, but what, in fairness to 
the public interest which determines their decree, should dictate as to the time or the circumstances under which that standard 
of equality has been caused, assuming that the standard of equality here requires what the Government says it requires? </p>
<p>Certainly the fact that local people do not like the result is not any condition 
that should influence or in any wise influence the court; but whether you actually 
have a building in which children can go to school, and what distances there are, and things like that, like questions 
of abating a nuisance which the local fellow has to determine is or is not an evasion of the requirements, are one of those 
facts of life that not even a court can overcome. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: If there is no appropriation by a legislature to build 
a school, the court cannot raise the taxes, the court cannot raise taxes by a court 
decree; or if a state makes a redistribution, the court cannot say, &quot;You are indulging 
in educational gerrymandering.&quot; </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: I am not suggesting that I have 
exhausted the difficulties, because we still have them; but I do suggest that the 
standard is inherent in the very contention made by the Government, namely, that 
the standard of equality is not satisfied, indeed is violated, by a separation based 
merely on color. Assuming that is so, then I do not see how you can escape some of the things 
which worry my Brother Jackson, and I know raise some questions. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: They do not worry me; they will be worrying our children.
</p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: May it please the Court, it is the position of the Government in 
this case, these cases are peculiarly those that deserve the most wise judgment of the members of this bench in the interests of this 
country. We are dealing with a problem of equality before the law for little children. We are busy in the educational process throughout the country in saying to these children that our Constitution 
means that all men, regardless of race, color or creed, are equal. None are better, 
none are worse, and to do— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: I do not want to disagree with you on that, Mr. Rankin. But 
the problem we have here is: How is that to be implemented if the case should be 
decided that segregation was unconstitutional? These parties in these several cases 
have asked us for a decree of court that they be admitted to certain schools. Are 
they entitled to that in case of segregation? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: It is our position that, unless it can be shown by the defendants 
that that cannot be accomplished at once, in accordance with the precedents of this Court of granting them their present and personal 
rights when their constitutional rights are invaded, that they should have them.
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Isn&#39;t it necessary in every school district at the present 
time that they have certain facilities, necessary facilities? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: That is right. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: They will be admitted, I suppose, tomorrow, if they wanted to take them. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: We also take the position that it is reasonable for this Court to 
remand the matter to the lower court and to take into consideration, as equity courts 
have for generations, the problems that have to be dealt with in any inequities that can be presented; and that the lower court can properly then determine how rapidly a plan can be 
achieved to come within the criteria established by this Court and the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment; and that upon consideration of that, with all diligent speed, the lower court can enter a decree accordingly; and we visualize problems, but our courts have many problems, and they deal with those problems, 
and they weigh the various problems against the rights involved to accomplish the 
result in the best manner and as rapidly as possible. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE REED</b>: Mention one problem, mention just one. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, the question is whether or not children should attend tomorrow 
or the next school term; and I do not see any great problem in that for the federal 
district court. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: What is the criteria, though? What considerations would 
you say would justify postponing it until next term, if he has a present right to 
enter? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Whether or not it was a deliberate attempt to evade the judgment 
of this Court of equity, or whether or not there are sound reasons that the action 
should be delayed because of transportation problems, whether or not the building 
is adequate, all of those matters— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: Suppose you have two schools; you have a school that has 
been used by white pupils, a pretty good school; you have a pretty poor one that 
has been used by colored children. What are you going to do? How are you going to 
decide—you either have got to build a new school or you have got to move some white people 
into the poor school, which would cause a rumpus, or you have got to center them 
all in the good school. What would the court take into consideration? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Well, time after time the courts have said that they were not going 
to be bothered by the worries and difficulties of the litigants about meeting the 
requirements of the Constitution or other principles laid down by this Court; and 
I think those are the problems that have to be dealt with by the local school districts,
and they would have the obligation to bring in a plan to accomplish this in accordance 
with the order of this Court as rapidly as could be obtained, and the details of it would not be a problem of the Court 
unless it found that the plan was unreasonable, that it was a deliberate attempt to evade the order of the Court, or that it 
was not equitably proper. Those standards— 
</p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON</b>: This is the most definite one, what appears on page 186, 
being the most definite thing that you have been able to devise? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: We explored the possibility of more definite decrees, but experience seems to dictate that the more definite courts 
are, appellate courts, in trying to describe the activities 
of lower courts, the more often they are apt to not give them the opportunity
to solve the problem in the best manner possible. </p>
<p>We conceived that the position and the duty of this Court is to establish the 
broad general principles of what could be obtained, what the Fourteenth Amendment meant with regard to equality in the attendance 
of schools: that there could not be a distinction because of race. </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Am I right in assuming, if not in inferring—I do not 
think I have the right to infer—but in assuming that the Government in its suggestions as to the kind of a decree is not dealing 
with these cases on the assumption that what is involved are just these individual 
children; but you have indicated a while ago that underlying your suggestions lies the assumption that these cases will settle a widespread problem, as indicated by both Mr. Davis 
and Mr. Moore, involving, whatever it is, the relationship of ten million Negroes 
in seventeen states, and that it is not a question of putting one child in a school, 
but how to make a readjustment of an existing system throughout the states where 
this present practice prevails; is that right? </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: Yes. We thought— </p>
<p><b>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER</b>: Rather than looking forward to having endless lawsuits 
of every individual child in the seventeen states for the indefinite future. </p>
<p><b>MR. RANKIN</b>: We felt that your question, Your Honor, reached that far and, further, 
for the Department of Justice of the United States to close its eyes to the effect 
of the precedent established by this Court, if it should so decide, was not the 
help that this Court was entitled to receive; and that we should view the extent 
of the reach that the decision might properly obtain and try to give the help that 
we could in regard to it. </p>
<p><b>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN</b>: Thank you, Mr. Rankin. </p>
<p>[Oral argument was concluded at 2:50 o&#39;clock p.m.] </p>
