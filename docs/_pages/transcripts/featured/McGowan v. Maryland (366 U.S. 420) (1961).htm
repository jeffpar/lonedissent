<P> MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Number 8,  <i>Margaret M. McGowan et al appellants </i>
versus<i> Maryland.</i> 
</P><P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Silbert?</P><P align="center"> ORAL ARGUMENT BY 
HARRY SILBERT,<br>
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT, NUMBER 8 
</P><P> MR. SILBERT: May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice, Justices.&nbsp; 
I would like to correct a mistake I think which occurred unintentionally. Mr. 
Burger I believe stated that the next case was a case of the Two Guys From 
Harrison.&nbsp; I represent the seven defendants--the seven appellants--who 
sustained a criminal conviction in Anne Arundel County in the state of Maryland.&nbsp; 
Incidentally, these appellants work for the Two Guys from Harrison.&nbsp; So 
that actually I think he had reference to the case, that is, following me, 
rather than this particular case.</P>
<P> [00:57] My clients worked for the Two Guys from Harrison, which is a large 
retail establishment in the county of Maryland. Within the confines of this 
establishment are sold many many things--as has been testified, almost 
everything under the sun.&nbsp; On a Sunday, the police arrested these people, 
and they were charged with selling.&nbsp; Two of them were convicted 
of--convicted--for selling a three-ring loose-leaf notebook.&nbsp; Four of them 
were convicted for selling a stapler and staplers.&nbsp; One was convicted of 
selling a toy submarine.&nbsp; These convictions were sustained by our appellate 
court of Maryland.&nbsp; I think--we claim--that these convictions are not 
proper, and that in light of the First and Fourteenth amendment to the 
Constitution, should not be sustained, and should be overthrown in this Court 
here.</P>
<P> [01:58] In order to more clearly familiarize ourselves with the Sunday Blue 
Laws, I think it would be well to examine the Sunday Blue Laws as they apply to 
the state of Maryland.&nbsp; The first law was enacted in 1723, and remains 
substantially in its same form today. It&#39;s known as article--section 492 of 
article 27, which is the criminal article affecting the criminal laws of 
Maryland.&nbsp; It is entitled the Sabbath Breaking.&nbsp; From this article 
492, and I refer to our jurisdictional statement which outlines the section 492, 
it says that:</P>
<blockquote>
  <P>[02:51] No person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the 
  Lord&#39;s Day, commonly called Sunday, and no person having children or servants 
  shall command or wittingly or willingly suffer any of them to do any manner of 
  work or labor on the Lord&#39;s Day, except works of necessity and charity always 
  excepted; nor shall suffer or permit any children or servants to profane the 
  Lord&#39;s Day by gaming, fishing, fowling, hunting, or unlawfully pastime--or 
  unlawful pastime--or recreation.&nbsp; And [that] every person transgressing 
  this section and being hereof convicted before a Justice of the Peace, shall 
  forfeit five dollars, to be applied to the use of the county.</P>
</blockquote>
<P> [03:37] Thereafter a series of exceptions were carved out to this general 
Blue Law. Section 521, which was enacted almost the same time as this section, 
and sustained a number of exceptions thereto, permit on a statewide basis the 
sale of certain food commodities, such as soft drinks, candies, uh, confections, 
milks and ice--ice cream and ices, certain tobaccos, certain motor fuels and 
greases, and certain periodicals to be sold on Sunday.&nbsp; This has statewide 
effect.</P>
<P> [04:13] Section 522, which follows the one just read, prevents on the 
Sabbath Day as it says commonly called Sunday the operation of any dancing 
saloon, opera house, tent and alley, barber saloon, or bail alley--ball 
alley--within this--within the state.</P>
<P> [04:39] Thereafter a section known as 509, which came after 521 and 522, and 
from that is the problem that we have facing the Court today. The state of 
Maryland contends that my clients were convicted under the General Section of 
521, which is the prohibition of the sale of items, which we admit are not 
included in the exceptions of 521. However, 509 is a section which applies in 
effect only to Anne Arundel County, and it exempts from the operation of 
sections 492, 521 and 522--it says it shall be lawful to operate, and work, or 
to be employed in the occupations of operating any bathing beach, bathhouse, 
amusement park, dancing saloon, the selling or sales of any novelties, 
souvenirs, cup accessories, or other merchandise essential to or customarily 
sold or incidental to the operation of the aforesaid businesses and occupations 
at retail. It also gives them the right to rent beach chairs and beach 
umbrellas, but that is not incidental to this case.</P>
<P> [05:57] So from this overall--</P>
<P> [05:59] Q: Is it conceded that, uh, the exceptions apply only to Anne 
Arundel County?</P>
<P> [06:04] A: I believe so.&nbsp; 509 is only applicable by the title to Anne 
Arundel County.&nbsp; It says beaches, amusement parks, picnic groves, in Anne 
Arundel County.&nbsp; The code of Maryland specifically says this will only 
apply to Anne Arundel County.</P>
<P> [06:18] Now there are a great number of other sections following 492 and 521 
and 522, excepting numbers of activities and sales of merchandise in the various 
political subdivisions of the state of Maryland.&nbsp; Also applicable to 
Baltimore City, [06:32] where we have a great multitude of exceptions.&nbsp; But 
509 carves out a large exception and says that you can sell anything which would 
customarily be sold at a bathing beach--that these items are admitted to be 
properly--offered for proper sale at a bathing beach is borne out by the trial 
facts Judge Michaelson when he tried--when he tried this case in the ninth xxx 
court, he said--the court said to counsel trying case:</P>
<blockquote>
  <P>If you could wave a magic wand and make all these places where the alleged 
  violations of the law occurred--bathing beaches or amusement parks--why, you 
  wouldn&#39;t have much difficulty, would you?</P>
</blockquote>
<P>When we objected to the fact that this created an arbitrary or unreasonable 
classification of the law, I submit to your Honors that we--our clients--suffer 
pecuniary loss, directly.&nbsp; The preceding cases have belabored the fact, did 
they or did they not suffer pecuniary loss.&nbsp; Here we have a mercantile 
establishment operated not at a bathing beach, selling items which the court 
says can be sold at a bathing beach.&nbsp; Now it so happens that the Two Guys 
From Harrison&#39;s retail establishment is located within a few miles of the 
bathing beaches, so that a man on his way to a bathing beach would not be able 
to buy a stapler, the can of wax, or the toy submarine, yet he could buy that 
very item at a bathing beach and be solely within his legal rights, as the law 
lies--lays them down.&nbsp; If you will refer to Judge Michaelson&#39;s decision, in 
finding our clients guilty--for the purposes brevity, he refers to the 
distinction as being ridiculous, ridiculous to believe that you can buy a can of 
beer, or buy a prohibited item, and yet be able to buy an accepted item, and yet 
not be able to buy a shirt, or as he characterized it, a collar button if you 
were going to a wedding or some affair on Sunday, unless you actually went to a 
bathing beach to buy it.</P>
<P>Now, we say, and we&#39;ve urged, that the courts rule this to be arbitrary and 
unreasonable.&nbsp; We have heard that there are number of cases on point, and 
there are a number of cases which distinguish, as in the Utah case, or in the 
Georgia case, which says, well, you can buy--it would be--it&#39;s not--it is 
arbitrary to say that you can buy a bottle of beer, and yet not buy a can of 
orange juice.</P>
<P>But this is a different case.&nbsp; This case, the same item, the very item 
that you can buy at the bathing beach may not be sold around the corner if it 
doesn&#39;t face the bathing beach.&nbsp; So that, if in any respect, this law can 
be classified, we say the classification is arbitrary and unreasonable and 
subjective to judicial review.&nbsp; It does not lie within the province of a 
legislature, even though it be subjected, as the Harvard Law Review and as the 
Rudkin Law Review says, that it is subjective to the private interests and the 
pressure groups to cut away from the law certain items which can be sold.&nbsp; 
This is the very same item that has a denial with the privilege of the law 
behind it.&nbsp; It has the effect of the law to say to one group of merchants 
you cannot sell a toy submarine, a can of wax, or a stapler.&nbsp; And to say to 
another group of merchants in the same county--not only in the same state but 
the same county--you can sell it.</P>
<P>[11:13] JUSTICE BLACK: You think the Slaughterhouse Cases have any relevance 
to your problem?</P>
<P>[11:22] A: I am not fully acquainted with the Slaughterhouse Cases as to be 
able to pass an intelligent opinion.</P>
<P>[11:33] I do feel that my--</P>
<P>[11:35] JUSTICE BLACK: --they sustained the monopoly against the charge that 
it violated due process and equal protection.</P>
<P>[11:43] A: Well, there are monopolies, I think I can comment on that, sir.&nbsp; 
There are monopolies which are created by law, or are authorized by law, and 
have their place in our society, and they have the right to do certain things 
that possibly others don&#39;t.&nbsp; But this is not a monopoly.&nbsp; This is a 
case of the private individual, the private citizen.&nbsp; It would mean that if 
you were engaged in--</P>
<P>[12:08] JUSTICE BLACK: I gathered from what you said it was giving a monopoly 
to the beach to sell certain types of goods--</P>
<P>[12:13] A: But there are a number--there are a number of beaches.&nbsp; 
Picture if you may Atlantic City.&nbsp; Picture if you can Atlantic City as a 
beach.&nbsp; If we had that same beach in the county of-- in Anne Arundel 
County, all the stores on--facing the beach could sell anything they wanted, 
which could--which would include everything.&nbsp; Yet if you were on the other 
side of the beach--not a bathing beach--you couldn&#39;t sell it.&nbsp; Now I&#39;m not 
talking about any other item except that which is sold at the beach.</P>
<P>[12:42] JUSTICE BLACK: Now what you&#39;re saying is that the state has ... that 
power to require people to buy their goods from a beach if it wants to do so.</P>
<P>[12:50] A: I believe so.&nbsp; Because this is not a monopoly, it&#39;s not 
created for public necessity.&nbsp; Monopolies are usually--usually derive their 
origin, I believe, in some necessity which benefits the public, but these don&#39;t.</P>
<P>Now, with respect--as I say, I leave the subject of the arbitrary 
classification on these items with a feeling that, if permitted, it would give 
those private pressure groups the right to create--to create quasi-monopolies by 
saying &quot;You will lose out,&quot; and the individual who operates a store not on a 
beach, and the person who works in that store is deprived of his right to make a 
living, and the owner is deprived--deprived of his right to sell.&nbsp; While 
blessed with the sanction of the law behind him, the same mercantile operation 
in the bathing beach area thrives.</P>
<P>This we believe to be beyond the pale of reasonable classification.&nbsp; It 
becomes arbitrary.</P>
<P>[14:08] CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Isn&#39;t that done in a lot of states, uh, a lot 
of local action laws?&nbsp; The one county has certain regulations, and one next 
to it has no regulation at all?</P>
<P>[14:35] A: Mr. Justice Warren, Chief Justice Warren, I--I would--I&#39;d 
subscribe to that.&nbsp; I&#39;d subscribe that theory, except that this is a 
classification within the county itself.&nbsp; In the original trial of the case 
of--instead of Maryland versus my clients--the state attorney Mr. Duvall quoted 
the Salisbury case--the court of appeals of Maryland which had behind it the 
only unlawful search and seizure, uh, bowstack as we term it, and he said if the 
act applies to the whole state, it&#39;s a valid state.&nbsp; In this case, it 
exempted three counties from the operation of the bowstack.&nbsp; However, our 
Attorney General, in 159--in 1959--advised the Governor that the proposed 
passage of a minimum price requirement--that is imposing upon state stores in 
five counties in the state of Maryland the right to impose minimum price 
controls on liquor-- would be unconstitutional as not affecting the entire 
state.</P>
<P>[15:31] Now, this is the same Attorney General&#39;s office--</P>
<P>[15:34] JUSTICE BLACK: You mean it would violate the state constitution?</P>
<P>[15:37] A: Beg pardon?</P>
<P>[15:38] JUSTICE BLACK: You mean it would violate the state constitution?</P>
<P>[15:40] A: As being a classification.</P>
<P>JUSTICE BLACK: The state constitution?</P>
<P>A: That&#39;s correct.&nbsp; We say it goes one step further, it deprives our 
people of their property and their right to make a living without due process of 
law--of law--and in violation of the Fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States.</P>
<P>Now with respect to the religious aspect, all of these exceptions and the two 
original general laws are entitled Sabbath Breakers.&nbsp; We have two cases in 
Maryland--the Pearson case and the Duke Fine case.&nbsp; I think in the Duke 
Fine case, the thought brought home is very vivid.&nbsp; They attempt to define 
the Sunday Law as being a day of rest, and the court of appeals upheld that.&nbsp; 
And the court in its--in its decision said that if in the operation of this one 
day of rest the majority or the non-religion is benefited by thereto, as indeed 
it should be, then that would be a good law, if it encouraged the observance by 
the dominant group in Maryland of their religious views.</P>
<P>Now we hold--we have no ultimate saggitarian laws.&nbsp; The people that I 
represent are of number--are very religious.&nbsp; My research of the religious 
phase--phases of the inhabitants of our country leads me to believe that there 
is no day in the week in all seven that could be said to be without religious 
significance.&nbsp; The Friends, for example, hold every day holy.</P>
<P>Q: When?</P>
<P>A: All day, every day, one day is holy as the other.&nbsp; The Mohammeds--</P>
