<br><center><b>PROCEEDINGS</b></center>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Number 23, <i>B. A. Reynolds,</i> et cetera, et al., appellants, versus <i>M.O. Sims,</i> et al.</p>
<p>THE CLERK: Counsel are present.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Mr. Pitts, you may proceed with your argument.</p>
<center>ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. McLEAN PITTS, ESQ.,<br>
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT REYNOLDS, AND<br>
APPELLEES A. BAGGETT, ET AL.</center>
<p>MR. PITTS: Mr. Chief Justice Warren and may it please the Court:</p>
<p class="P1">It is with great humility that I appear before this
Court, in view of some of the propositions that we are going to make to
this Court in behalf of the appellants in this case. I would briefly go
through some of the points that lead up to the decision in this case,
while going through, historically, a little of the Alabama history
relative to its constitutional convention and the acts of the
legislature that are involved.</p>
<p class="P1">On March the 26th, this Court gave the—handed down the decision of <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i> which was a somewhat radical departure from the cases from 1803 to 1962. <i>Baker</i>
represents neither the familiar pattern of judicial review and
occasional negation of particular governmental policies, nor the newer
pattern in some of the desegregation cases of the imposition of “duties
to act,” rather than “to desist.” But both of these patterns have this
much in common: They leave essentially intact the distribution and
possession of political power by contract. It is my position that <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i>
is an invitation to the courts to sit in judgment of the structure of
political power, even to the effect of a judicial transfer of political
power.</p>
<p class="P1">Before the ink was dry on the <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i>
decision—and on April the 14th, 1962—the three–judge district court
issued its ultimatum to the Alabama Legislature that it must
reapportion itself. On July the 12th, 1962, the Alabama Legislature
produced <b>[*2]</b> two bills. One of them was a 67th Amendment bill,
which was a constitutional amendment that was to be submitted to the
people of Alabama. Then they passed the Webb–Crawford Act, which was a
savings Act that would have reapportioned the 1966 legislature,
provided the people of Alabama turned down the 67th Amendment Act at
the polls. On July the 25th—not 13 days after the passage of the Act,
of these two Acts—the Federal three–judge district court declared both
of these Acts unconstitutional. And in their decision, they took the
senatorial provisions of the Webb–Crawford Act, and the House
provisions of the 67th Amendment Act, put the two together and
legislated for the State of Alabama.</p>
<p class="P1">Now my propositions to this Court are simply that the legislative reapportionment—four propositions I want to make to the Court:</p>
<p class="P1">One, legislative reapportionment should be resolved without Federal interference. The Court should reconsider <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i> or clarify <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i> and return to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not interfere with the structure of the states.</p>
<p class="P1">Two, the courts should limit themselves, under the
time–honored constitutional provisions for checks and balances, to the
function of judicial review of legislative acts. They should not invade
the province of the legislature, whether it is done by exacting new
laws or whether it is done by a veto power.</p>
<p class="P1">Three, the court should not have declared invalid the
proposed amendment to the Constitution of Alabama which, by the Act of
the legislature, was to be submitted to the vote of the people of
Alabama on a one–man, one–vote basis.</p>
<p class="P1">Four, even under <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i> the
District Court should not have retained jurisdiction in this case,
because the factual situation in the case at bar is different from the
facts in the Tennessee case.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, in order for you gentlemen to understand properly my
argument, it is necessary for me to go back a little bit to the
Constitutional Convention of 1901. That Convention brought together
delegates in Montgomery, Alabama, who have been recognized as the
greatest minds of political thought and lawyers in that State. They
came up—as I heard the argument of the New York case yesterday, it
brought me to mind, in reading the proceedings of the 1901
Constitutional Convention of Alabama, that practically every point that
was made before this Court about the distribution of political power
and districting was discussed in the 1901 Constitutional Convention of
Alabama. That constitution was submitted to the people on a one–man,
one–vote basis, and was adopted by the people.</p>
<b>[*3]</b>
<p>THE COURT: Then it wasn’t followed?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Sir?</p>
<p>THE COURT: But then it wasn’t followed by the State, was it?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: I’ll come on down to that in just a little bit. I’m getting to that point.</p>
<p class="P1">In deciding to—in arriving at this, these men realized
the great geographical differences that exist in the State of Alabama.
Alabama is a State of great natural resources. I’m not talking for the
Chamber of Commerce, but I’m just pointing this out to the Court.
Alabama is a State of great natural resources. Of course in the center
of the State, around the Birmingham area, we have the steel mills,
coal; you go into the north and the Tennessee Valley, you run into
great farming areas. Of course, now, you’ll run into [Inaudible]<a href="#fn1" name="fnref1"><sup>(<small>1</small>)</sup></a>,
which is greatly increased in population recently. Then, in the south
and this middle part of the State which is known as the “black belt”
which I am from, you run into the farming and rural areas. Then as you
go on down to Mobile, you run into the waterfronts—the coastal
area—and, again, an industrial section.</p>
<p class="P1">All of this was kept in mind—what I’m trying to point out
to the Court—in this 1901 Constitutional Convention. We of the black
belt recognize that there was malapportionment in the Alabama
Legislature in 1960, and I’m not standing before this Court and saying
that there was not malapportionment before in the legislature in 1960.
But we certainly say that if the Legislature of Alabama is to be
reapportioned, then it should be reapportioned by the Legislature of
Alabama and not by a Federal court.</p>
<p>THE COURT: How long would we have to wait from 1901, beyond 1960?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: We wait from 1901 until 1962, Mr. Justice Warren.</p>
<p class="P1">But what I want to point out is—the point that we want to
make is how we differ from the Tennessee case; that, although we waited
from 1901 until 1962 when the District Court issued its ultimatum to
the Alabama Legislature, they acted promptly and they did pass a
constitutional amendment to be submitted to the people of Alabama—and
even another Act, known as the Webb–Crawford Act, which is a savings
Act, in the event—</p>
<p>THE COURT: I understand, though, that you want us to say that <b>[*4]</b>
the court had no right to coerce the legislature into doing that,
although it had, for 60 years, failed to follow its own constitution.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You want us to say that, even though it went another 60 years?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="P1">But I want to point out, it’s my position in this—getting back to the point of <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i>
which I believe that under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, I
believe that the court had jurisdiction to say that it was
unconstitutional, but I do not believe that the court has the power to
legislate for the people of Alabama.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You concede that it’s justiciable? The question?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, in the Constitutional Convention of 1901, the
legislature was set up so that there would be a house and a senate; not
more than 35 senators and not more than 135—105 members of the house.
Then they proceeded to set up 35 senatorial districts and provided that
each senator was to have a district. Then there is another provision of
the Alabama Constitution that says that the senate shall not consist of
less than one–fourth or more than one–third of the house of
representatives. The house of representatives should consist of 105
members. Each county shall have at least one representative. No county
shall be divided into two senatorial districts, and no district shall
be made up of two or more districts not contiguous to each other.</p>
<p class="P1">Now those are the provisions in the Alabama Constitution
that the legislature was confronted with any time that it started to
reapportion. There have been many bills introduced, but those were the
constitutional provisions of the 1901 constitution. And the point that
I’m trying to make to this Court is that it is not on a population
basis. The Solicitor General, in his brief, cites percentages and
figures, but actually the Alabama Legislature is not based solely on
its population basis. It is based on an area basis and a population
basis, so that no geographical section of the State would have a
stranglehold on the Alabama Legislature.</p>
<p class="P1">If you go strictly to a population basis, then the
larger, or densely populated, counties would have a strangle–hold on
the Alabama Legislature on a one–man, one–vote basis, and the people in
the rural areas would not have any say–so in their own government.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. Pitts, I was wondering, if the court had the <b>[*5]</b>
right to declare your apportionment unconstitutional, what remedy could
it use in order to see that people did have their rights?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: I would anticipate that question, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>
<p>THE COURT: I’m sure you must.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: There are times, as I see it under the Federal
Declaratory Judgment Act, where the court could declare the rights. But
the courts could not provide an adequate remedy. That’s my answer.</p>
<p>THE COURT: In other words, it would be a right without a remedy?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, sir, I think it would be. I think you could have a
right to declare it, but I don’t think that they have a right to
legislate for the State of Alabama or the people of Alabama.</p>
<p class="P1">As I take it, <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i> simply said
that the Federal court, where there was invidious discrimination
existing, that the courts had jurisdiction. But there was so much in <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i>
that was left unsaid, and sort of guidelines to the lower court. And
what was suggested in the concurring opinion of the Justices has thrown
the lower courts into the midst of a political [Inaudible]. In other
words, as I understand it, it was suggested there that barring the—that
one of them was—that actually draw new legislative boundaries; or
threaten to do so if the legislature does not act promptly, to retain
jurisdiction while waiting for the legislature to act quickly. One of
those two things is about the only thing that a court could do to carry
out <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i> as to just what you asked me, as I see it. One of the two. Unless they proceed to legislate for the legislature.</p>
<p class="P1">In a way, the court, sitting waiting for the legislature
to act under what they will say would be a fair apportionment statute
or redistricting statute, would be a veto power in the court.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Do you really think, therefore, that the proposition
advanced by the plaintiffs in the litigation—that the Court should not
itself put its stamp of approval on this design for reapportionment,
but merely enjoin the election and have an election at large—that that
would be more preferable than what the court did?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You don’t like what the court did.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: No, sir, I don’t like what the court did. But I think that it would be a more—in order to break any strangle–hold on <b>[*6]</b>
the election of the legislature, if the court wanted to do it, I think
that an election–at–large, if the court didn’t act. But I don’t like
that.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="P1">As I’ve just said, I think that the power of veto over a
legislature transcends the separation of powers doctrine of the three
branches of government—the executive, the legislative, and the judicial.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Is this the position on which you’re arguing that this case ought to reconsider <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr?</i></p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, sir, I think you should. I’m arguing that you should reconsider <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr.</i> And the reason I said that—that I argued that point to this Court—that, as I see it, it should be reconsidered by this Court:</p>
<p class="P1">The principle of the separation of powers, and the three
branches of American government, transcends what equity power the Court
may have or may claim in order to step in and draw legislative
districts’ boundaries, even if the legislature disregards their
legislative responsibilities. This principle as I see it is clear in a
study of the notes of the proceedings of the 1901 Alabama Constitution,
and it is also clear in the notes of the secret debates of the 1787
Constitutional Convention. And, in this first Congress, these three
branches of government were kept distinctly free and equal—a system of
checks and balances. In going further and granting relief in that form,
and barring one of the two courses in granting relief, the Court
completely ignores these separation of powers and the dual system of
government in the United States.</p>
<p class="P1">I think that it’s our contention that the courts should
limit themselves under these time–honored constitutional provisions for
checks and balances to the function of judicial review of legislative
acts. They should not invade the legislative function, whether it be
done by enacting new laws through the use of judicial power, or by a
veto of the legislation. I do not see how we can escape that fourth
proposition. I have carefully read every word in <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i>
and particularly in view of the Alabama case. I think that the Alabama
case is entirely different from any of the other apportionment cases
that are pending before this Court. The Alabama case is the extreme
that a court can go to, whereas the New York case that was argued
yesterday is the other end of the extreme. As I see it, this points out
what a terrible situation can exist that flows from <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr.</i></p>
<p class="P1">Now, I may say to this Court, while I have stood here before <b>[*7]</b> you and told you that I was arguing that you should reconsider <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i> certainly if you don’t reconsider or change the rule in <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i>
you have got to give some guidelines or some limitations that can be
put down to the lower courts. Because the lower courts have taken the
decision of <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i> as an invitation to them
to step into the shoes of the legislatures of the various states. That
the legislative powers of the people can be organized according to the
dictates of the Federal Judiciary is in violation that the Government
shall be composed of the Executive, and the Legislative, and the
Judicial branches, each of whom exercises separate but equal power. A
Federal Judiciary that can dictate the organization of a state
legislature can indirectly—and I think this is important, and it’s set
out in our brief—that they can indirectly dictate the seats of the
House of Representatives that are redistricted by the Act of the state
legislature. Legislative reapportionment should be resolved without
Federal interference.</p>
<p class="P1">Now the case at bar is illustrative of the confusion that can result by the Federal Judiciary following <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr.</i>
The soundness of the majority opinion has been questioned by members of
the bar, courts, students of government, and for reasons we urge that
you reconsider this decision and return to the original constitutional
proposition.</p>
<p class="P1">As I just pointed out to you, the range of action in these Federal courts has been wide. Within 6 months after <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i>
suits were filed in 31 states, 41 opinions rendered, and special
sessions had been held in some 8 states. This we see from the Alabama
case and the New York case, we can see the wide range of action that <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i> has caused. As I see it—</p>
<p>THE COURT: Wouldn’t you agree, Mr. Pitts, that, conceding that
Alabama’s reapportionment violated the dictates of the Federal
Constitution, it would be the duty of the Federal courts to step in?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Mr. Justice Harlan, that would depend upon whether there can be found anything in the Constitution—</p>
<p>THE COURT: My question was: Assuming that that was not debatable,
that everybody agreed that Alabama’s apportionment did violate the
Federal Constitution, you certainly wouldn’t argue that the Federal
courts would not have the duty to vindicate constitutional rights?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: My contention that <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i> should be reconsidered? Yes, sir.</p>
<b>[*8]</b>
<p>THE COURT: I’m talking about your argument.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: What I’m trying to point out, in answer to your question,
sir—and I’m trying to answer it—is that if there is foundation in the
Constitution of the United States for the Federal courts to take
judicial—to take jurisdiction, then if there is malapportionment in the
Alabama Legislature and it amounts to “invidious discrimination,” then
the Federal court would have jurisdiction.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Shouldn’t we do something about it?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: My second proposition—</p>
<p>THE COURT: Therefore, I would think that the real answer to your
argument should be whether or not the Federal Constitution does
prohibit what Alabama has done.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Whether or not what Alabama has done comes under the
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Mr. Justice
Harlan, I agree with your opinion, and I can find nothing in the
Fourteenth Amendment that I would say that it would come under.</p>
<p>THE COURT: I suggest that’s the real burden of your argument here.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: But we also say that, even if it does come under it and even if <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i>
stands as the Court held, that the Federal Judiciary in Montgomery—or
the District Court—exceeded its authority in striking down a
constitutional amendment that was to be submitted to the people of
Alabama. And that is the way their constitution is amended, except
unless a constitutional convention is called.</p>
<p class="P1">My contention is that if <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i> does, that even in view of <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i> that the Federal court did not have the right to go as far as it went in the Alabama case.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. Pitts, do you argue that there isn’t great discrimination in Alabama?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, sir. Alabama’s population has changed greatly in the
last—since 1901—but I don’t see that there is discrimination. I think
that Alabama has a rational plan. The Legislature of Alabama has just
failed to act. The system that Alabama has, which is based not only on
population, but it is based on area. So I say that it’s not
discrimination. It’s a rational plan that Alabama has, but they have
just failed to act—the Legislature has.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Failure of the Legislature to act is breaking no <b>[*9]</b> laws, despite the 25 percent of the people of the State who [Inaudible], isn’t that correct?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: I’ll be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Justice Goldberg,
I’m not going into the mathematics of the situation. I don’t think that
that has—is neither here nor there, because of the Alabama system. But
I do say that, if that is true that it’s about 25 percent—I would say
it may be more than that, I don’t know; I believe it’s 38 percent—I
believe—</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well, as I read the figures in the record, in 1901 about 40 percent—</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: 44 percent. 44 percent.</p>
<p>THE COURT: —and because of the shift in population—</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: —and it dropped down, now. This act of the Federal court has brought it back up to around 41 percent, I think.</p>
<p>THE COURT: It’s restored the situation to what it was in—</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: About 3 percent back—restored it back to the 1901 Constitutional Convention—I mean “constitution.”</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. Pitts, going back to Justice Harlan’s question of a
moment ago, going back to the basic question before we get to a matter
of remedy, the basic question of constitutional violation here. As I
understood him, Mr. Justice Harlan said that the basic argument for you
to make was that there was no constitutional violation. But, as I read
the opinion of the Three–Judge Court of July 21st, 1962, that argument
is not open to you, unless I misread it, or unless the court here is
misstating the facts—and I’m quoting from page 144 of the record, where
the court says:</p>
<blockquote class="P1">It has been generally conceded throughout this
litigation by all the parties that the present apportionment of both
Houses of the Legislature of the State of Alabama constitutes
‘invidious discrimination’ in violation of the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>
<p class="P1">Is that factually untrue? Or is it true, this statement as to the concession by all the parties?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: I would like to explain to you, Mr. Justice, that I did
not participate in the trial of this case. If it is in the record—if
that is a true statement in the record, I will say that it is true that
that was conceded by the parties.</p>
<b>[*10]</b>
<p>THE COURT: In dealing, of course, with a great constitutional issue
of this kind, the concessions of lawyers, the concessions of parties,
the views of the lower court, while they’re of course entitled to the
greatest respect, are not the ultimate basis on which we have to decide
this case. We’re not bound by “concessions” in constitutional cases.
But I’m only suggesting that that issue wasn’t even litigated in the
District Court. It seemed so clear to everybody that the issues before
the court were quite different issues—<i>i.e.</i> as to what the remedy should be.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Now the Attorney General handled that in the lower
courts. B.A. Reynolds, Probate Judge of Dallas County, was a party
defendant. We got into the case after the court had decided the case
and we appealed it to this Court.</p>
<p>THE COURT: May I ask: If you were to win your contention, what would be the practical result in Alabama?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Mr. Justice Black, it seems to me that if we were to be
successful today, then the constitutional amendment would be submitted
to the people.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well what would be the result, with reference to the present members of the State Senate—the Legislature?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: You mean in the 67th Amendment Bill?</p>
<p>THE COURT: Those that are now the members of the Legislature of the State Senate. If you win, are they properly elected?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Oh, you are talking about the Legislature of Alabama?</p>
<p>THE COURT: Yes, the practical result.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Under the Federal court decree?</p>
<p>THE COURT: Yes.</p>
<p class="P1">If you win your contentions, what is the result, with reference to the present senate and Legislature of Alabama?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: I think that was a <i>de facto</i> Legislature, and I think that the validity of that Act will be determined by the Supreme Court of Alabama.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Now may I ask: If you would then return, in your elections, to the old apportionment?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Would that mean—as I read this, I’m not sure about this—that the Senator from Jefferson County where Bir–<b>[*11]</b>mingham is located, represents 634,000; while 1 senator from Lowndes County represents 7,000—15,417 people?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: If the Apportionment Act stands as it was in the 1901 constitution, what you say would be correct.</p>
<p>THE COURT: What would be the result, if you win your case?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: And this Amendment would take to the people—</p>
<p>THE COURT: I’m not talking about what “could” happen thereafter, but
what do we return to if you succeed in invalidating the judgment of the
Three–Judge Court?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: All right, sir, I think that you return to the constitutional amendment—the 67th Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You return to the apportionment as it has been?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, in the meantime.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You return to the apportionment as it has been?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Until that—</p>
<p>THE COURT: Then you’d have to wait, according to your contention,
for action in Alabama by a vote of the people on the amendment to the
constitution?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: But, in the meantime, Jefferson County would be entitled,
with a population of 650,000, to 1 senator; and Lowndes County, with
13,000, to a representation of 1 senator?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: That’s typical throughout the State, is it?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: I would say, yes, sir, that there’s malapportionment in
the Alabama Legislature, yes, sir. I would say, as it exists before the
67th Amendment Bill and the Webb–Crawford Act was passed.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well, that’s the practical situation which the court had to meet—</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: —but you claim it didn’t have jurisdiction. It couldn’t
have done it. But that’s the practical situation it had to meet if it
had jurisdiction?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes. But now the 67th Amendment Bill would have been submitted to the people immediately, because of elections <b>[*12]</b>
coming up. And if it had failed, you would have had apportionment under
the Webb–Crawford Act, which brought it back about to where the 44
percent that we were just talking about was.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Well now, Mr. Justice Goldberg, you were reading from the Webb–Crawford Act. That was the percentage you were citing.</p>
<p>THE COURT: I was reading from the record, from testimony about the Webb–Crawford Act.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes. You were speaking of the senate. Now the Federal
District Court took the senate provisions of the Webb–Crawford Act—</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well that doesn’t explain to me—</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, sir. I will, we contend—and I want to make this
statement, as I see that my time is about up—if this Three–Judge
Federal District Court decision in this case is allowed to stand, we
say that then Alabama and her sister states have been deprived of the
last vestige of state sovereignty. They are no longer sovereign states.
If the Federal Judiciary can sit over the legislature of a state and
veto the acts of that legislature and say that that legislature cannot
submit to the people of that state a constitutional amendment to their
own constitution, then I say that there is no longer a sovereign state.</p>
<p class="P1">I will retain the rest of my time in rebuttal.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: You may.</p>
<p class="p1">Attorney General Flowers?</p>
<center>ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHMOND M. FLOWERS, ESQ.,<br>ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ALABAMA, <i>PRO SE</i></center>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Mr. Chief Justice, if it pleases the Court:</p>
<p class="P1">The former Attorney General of Alabama was a party to
this suit. As I understand, he was brought in because of some
ministerial duty that he had in canvassing votes. Naturally he was
brought in along with some other public officials, in order for this
suit to develop—for the action to lie. The former Attorney General did
not appeal this decision. Thus I am here today as his successor.</p>
<p class="P1">I do not believe that there is a citizen or an official
of Alabama that could argue under any shadow of fairness or justice
that apportionment of the Legislature of Alabama under the 1901
constitution, as it is here today or as when this suit started, is any–<b>[*13]</b>thing
but unfair, unjust, and even approaches the ridiculous. On occasions,
the Supreme Court of Alabama has even recognized this fact.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we come to the proposition that the lower court has
taken jurisdiction. Now, as stated in our brief, we argue under the
presumption that <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i> will not be overturned. In that event, or in case <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i>
were overturned or reconsidered, we would want, or expect, or ask
another day in Court. But we argue here today under the presumption
that it will not be overturned.</p>
<p class="P1">If it pleases the Court, I have served a term in the
State Senate of Alabama before—naturally before—I became Attorney
General of that State. I represented—this may be peculiar, in that I
represented a two–county district, my home county, which was the most
under–represented county in the house of representatives, Houston
County, the most under–represented county in the State. And I also
represented an adjoining county as its senator, Henry County, which is
the second most over–represented county in the State of Alabama. I
think you gentlemen will admit that that’s a good job for one man to do.</p>
<p class="P1">Now my home County of some 50,000 people—slightly over—we
had one member of the house. We shared a senator with Henry County who
had something over 13,000 people. They had two members of the house.
Now they were only surpassed by one other County, Lowndes County, in
being more over–represented than they. Lowndes has slightly over 13,000
people. They have two members of the house, but they had a senator to
themselves. So, as you can see, the apportionment under the 1901
constitution at the time this started approaches the absolute
ridiculous. I argue not as to the validity or just how just or fair it
was in 1901, because in 1901 my home County of Houston did not even
exist. We were formed after the adoption of the 1901 constitution.</p>
<p class="P1">After the lower court took jurisdiction, then the
legislature passed some acts that the Three–Judge District Court said
were not acceptable. So they then wrote a temporary measure. As I
understand it, they said it was a temporary measure that would serve
until the legislature had passed a bill that was adequate. Now the
legislature has met and failed to act, I realize, however there are
reasons for that action—and I shall cover that later. But first let me
state that I very strongly join the doubts that may exist here, if any,
that a call for general standards to be laid down in all cases, or in
all states, I believe that to be unsound.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, while apologizing for not knowing the workings or
the alleged troubles of the states, I here today represent, as I say,
the State of Alabama. And I strongly feel—since I have actually en–<b>[*14]</b>gaged
in these legislative fights—I strongly feel that our problem lies in
having the one question answered: whether Alabama—whether Alabama—can
meet the equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment under
the State constitutional provisions or under our State constitutional
provisions providing for reapportionment. For instance, as you
gentlemen well know, we have one section of our constitution that
states that our house shall be based on a population basis and shall be
limited to 105 members, giving any new county that’s formed after the
adoption of the constitution, an additional member. That’s the reason
our present house consists of 106 members. We had one county—my County,
the baby County of Houston—to be formed since the 1901 constitution.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. Attorney General, while you’re on the subject of your
State Constitution, I wonder if you can tell me the meaning of—I’m now
referring to Section 284 of Article 18 of the 1901 constitution, which
says, as you’ve just told us, that representation in the legislature
shall be based upon population.</p>
<p class="P1">Now here’s my question: “And such basis of representation
shall not be changed by constitutional amendment.” What is the effect
of this in your State Constitution?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: I think it was well expressed in the New York case
yesterday, Mr. Justice, that allows a handful of people to lock
themselves into the legislature and hold control of the legislative
body of Alabama.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Can any constitution, which is subject to amendment,
provide that this part of the constitution is not subject to amendment?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: As a member of the State Senate, we propounded to the
supreme court an opinion of the justices on that particular point, and
we received one saying that it could not be changed. To me, it’s
ridiculous, but that’s your answer.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. Attorney General, I thought I read in one of the
briefs that your supreme court had interpreted that to mean that, while
the legislature could not submit an amendment to the constitution, it
could be amended through constitutional convention.</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: That is—</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: All right, I just wanted to understand.</p>
<b>[*15]</b>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: And in 1955 we introduced resolutions in both houses
calling for a constitutional convention. And in our 35–man senate, we
mustered 16 votes which were cast for a constitutional convention. And
it frightened that group so badly that when it came up in the house of
106 members, it only got 8 votes. They got more votes in the senate
then they got in the house.</p>
<p class="P1">Gentlemen, I have struggled and fought in these
legislative battles for reapportionment. I’m going to cover that a
little bit in just my last few remaining minutes. But this question of
whether under our constitution—whether, under our constitution—we can
meet the provisions, the equal protection provisions, of the Fourteenth
Amendment—as, for instance as I say, one section says that our house
shall be based on a population basis, shall be limited to 105 members
with one new member for each county. Then, at the same time, it gives
each county at least one–half member. So it shall be placed on a
population basis. And then it turns right around and gives every
county—the 67 we have—a house member. Then, in another section, it
limits the senate to 35 members.</p>
<p class="P1">The State practices and policies, supported by—even
supported by arguments in the constitutional convention—establish the
fact that no county shall have more than one senator. There has been
some doubt, and some have advanced the argument, that under the section
that says “no county shall be divided between two districts”—through
the years, no county has had more than one senator; and I think that
was the intention of that particular section, that they should
not—there have been arguments advanced that this means you couldn’t
take part of a county and tack it onto another one. That’s not our
decision here today, but some have argued that you could have districts
within a county.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. Attorney General, is it your position that the
legislature could, or could not, adequately apportion, reapportion, the
legislature under the 1901 constitution?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: No, sir, I believe it’s physically impossible. It’s
politically impossible for the legislature to reapportion itself under
the 1901 constitution.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Under the 1901 constitution?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir, because there are just a handful of people
who have gained control of the legislature, and naturally it’s hard to
ask a man to vote himself out of power.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Aside from political realities, is it your position that
even if it were done that the resulting reapportionment would <b>[*16]</b> still violate the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: No, sir. The Three–Judge District Court, now, has
intimated in their language, they said that our apportionment could be
done on a population basis, to some extent. Of course now I realize we
approach the twilight zone when we say “to some extent,” but if you
affirm this—and I saw, I engaged in the fights, and although I was not
in the last, in the session that actually reapportioned, I was there
and I saw men struggling, wanting this question answered whether, even
if they did thus–and–so, would it answer the Fourteenth Amendment, and
they were unable to get that answer.</p>
<p class="P1">And under our provisions, if you feel, or you affirm, or
take the attitude of the Three–Judge District Court in saying: Yes, to
some extent, you can, then I believe the legislature can and will move
forward under the direction of the lower court, if it be your pleasure.
But I believe they can and will move forward to make it. Because,
otherwise, some of our constitutional provisions have to fall. And it’s
my opinion—my observation—that this Court bends backward to keep from
knocking down constitutional—state constitutional provisions. And if it
be your attitude, or your decision that some of our, one or more of our
provisions have to fall under the direction of the lower court, if it
be your will, let our legislature reapportion. And in that way, let
them—our people—decide which must fall, or what they should resubmit to
the people in the place of it. Let them put it back to the State
Legislature of Alabama.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Hasn’t the District Court done that? Hasn’t the District Court done that—put it back to the legislature?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir, without their action. But it is my sincere
conviction that this one question was what threw them at loggerheads in
that fight—because I stood there on the floor and watched them—was
whether or not, under the equal protection clause, would our provisions
fit under there? Would they meet it? Would they answer the equal
protection clause, this division of the house and division of the
senate the way we have it, even if we put it as the District Court
said, “to some extent.” And I want to agree with the counsel before me
that Alabama is peculiar in that it is heavily sectionalized. It’s an
economic thing. It’s not just geography. It’s sectionalized
economically. The Tennessee Valley, the industrial area of Birmingham,
the black belt, and my “wiregrass area,” as we call it, was ignored by
the previous counsel—the port area of Mobile. It is heavily
sectionalized, and I think could be districted in such a way that, if
we were allowed to say “to some extent,” that it could be done where
most everyone would be <b>[*17]</b> happy with what we did.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You’re here basically, aren’t you, in support of the present decree of the District Court? Aren’t you?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir. Because I cannot see the legislature—I stood
five days and nights in a sustained filibuster—with a preponderance of
the State Senate voting, supporting reapportionment in Alabama—to
absolutely no avail. I was a member of the State Legislature when a
suit was filed, and the District Court refused to take jurisdiction,
and every bill that was introduced in every way failed. They absolutely
refused. A few people had the control. They would not vote themselves
out. As our populations grew and theirs withdrew, their strength became
more and more and more.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. Attorney General, [Inaudible], and therefore the
District Court came down with a temporary order under which the
election was held—</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: —and it retained jurisdiction?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: In the event the legislature decided hereafter to amend
the constitution, and therefore the District Court has the authority or
jurisdiction to—</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir, with the exception of this one question—and
maybe we do not have it in—but if you could answer for them, whether or
not Alabama can meet the equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth
Amendment under the State constitutional provisions that we have,
providing for reapportionment, if they can under the court’s—the lower
court’s—guidance, I think the Legislature of Alabama could correct
themselves.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You’ve added this thought, I take it, over what you had in your brief then, I take it?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: I gather that you thought there was nothing to decide
here in your brief. And now you suggest that we really should get to
whether or not the provisions in the Alabama Constitution themselves
are acceptable under the Fourteenth Amendment. Isn’t that your point?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir. Whether they meet the provisions—</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well let’s see if I understand that—</p>
<b>[*18]</b>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: It was in our brief at page 5.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well I understand, Mr. Flowers, what you’re suggesting
is, abstractly: Would the Alabama constitutional formulation, if
executed—“if executed”—satisfy the requirements of the equal protection
clause? Is that it?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="P1">You see, the Three–Judge District Panel said that they felt it could, “to some extent.”</p>
<p>THE COURT: Now even if—I gather there’s somewhat of a mystery about what the Alabama Constitution means?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: There could be some questions. There have been, in
fact, every time the legislature meets and attempts to put out a
constitutional amendment to the people. The 67th Amendment Bill has
been put out and soundly defeated three times.</p>
<p>THE COURT: So you really do leave us with somewhat of a problem?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Yes, sir. I fought those fights through the night.
Alabama needs reapportionment. Alabama doesn’t have reapportionment.</p>
<p>THE COURT: But you think you know fairly enough what the Alabama
Constitution means to say that the apportionment that existed before
the court took action violated the Alabama Constitution?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Before they took action? No, sir, I don’t think it violated the Alabama Constitution.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Oh, you don’t?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: The 1901 constitution? The apportionment that they had?</p>
<p>THE COURT: Do you think that the—</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: Oh, you mean the “10–year refusal”? Why, yes, sir. Yes,
sir, absolutely I do. They’re refusing to act. I don’t know if that
negates the constitution, but they certainly didn’t follow the
constitution, and continually refused to follow it. It wasn’t an
oversight.</p>
<p>THE COURT: And the constitution—and the Crawford–Webb Bill? Do you think that violates the existing constitution?</p>
<p>MR. FLOWERS: I think it’s just a poor substitute, yes, sir. It
wasn’t to my liking. It’s better than what we had, but if it would <b>[*19]</b> allow us to move on—excuse me, gentlemen. I see my time is up.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Mr. Morgan?</p>
<center>ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES MORGAN, JR., ESQ., ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES IN NUMBER 23</center>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</p>
<p class="P1">We have entered, in the arguments in the last day—today
and yesterday—I think, the political thicket. And we’ve done this,
generally, by adhering to standards of apportionment, or questioning
about standards of apportionment and comments on them, which vary from
the shipping interests and their representation in the legislatures,
the interests of labor and business, to mathematics and formulae.</p>
<p class="P1">And really it seems to me that, in the argument, one fact
comes through. It is that the easiest, the most easily judicially
maintainable standard of apportionment should certainly be population,
regardless of all the problems that may develop and all the problems
that may exist in many states and may exist in many different counties
and many different districts. It would seem that surely the one
standard that is measurable in each instance, leaving less room for
doubt and less room for question insofar as each of the state
legislatures of this nation are concerned, is the ascertainable
standard of: How many people are there in a legislative district? Or
how many people are there in a representative seat?</p>
<p class="P1">Now in Alabama the facts have been adequately noted with
respect to the existing apportionment of the legislature. We’ve had no
apportionment since 1901. And the people of Alabama have no place to go
in order to seek redress for their grievances other than the United
States courts. The state courts of Alabama have refused to take
jurisdiction. There is no initiative and referendum in the State.</p>
<p class="P1">The legislature, for 60 years, refused to reapportion.
And there is, of course, no conception that they would change their
minds, except under a court order. And the constitutional convention
provisions that are provided in our constitution allow the State
Legislature, and provide for the State Legislature, to establish the
method of representation at the convention. And it is inconceivable to
me that, especially in light of the long lapse in apportionment, that
were we ever to have another constitutional convention, that the
legislature of Alabama would alter in its default with respect to
apportionment by selecting delegates to that convention who would
apportion them out of their seats.</p>
<b>[*20]</b>
<p class="P1">The United States District Court’s action in Montgomery,
in enjoining the 67th Amendment, was to us quite proper and quite
reasonable. The State Constitution says that population is the
ascertainable standard and that it cannot be changed, and the Alabama
Supreme Court has, in advisory opinions which are not binding upon the
court and do not have the force of law but which bind only those
justices who state their preferences—who do state their preferences—the
court has held that that provision cannot be taken from the
constitution, from Section 284.</p>
<p class="P1">Now that provision quite clearly says that, in Alabama at
least, population is the goal for which we’re working in legislative
apportionment; and representation shall be based on population, and
that provision should not be deleted from the constitution, even by
constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well you wouldn’t—do you think that that would bind the
people of the State of Alabama if they wanted to adopt a new provision
to the constitution which applied a different rule?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: I don’t see how it could, but the Supreme Court of Alabama has.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You mean they’ve said that their constitution has
foreclosed the situatation in the State so that the people cannot, of
their own choice, adopt a new constitutional provision contrary to the
1901 provision? Is that in there? Do you have that opinion in any part
of the record?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Yes, sir, I’m sure it’s in—I’m not sure, it’s—</p>
<p>THE COURT: At what point in the record?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Page 147.</p>
<p>THE COURT: That says, “to withhold from the legislature the power”?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Yes, sir, that’s right.</p>
<p class="P1">Now the people, of course, in a constitutional convention
could change it, but they can’t have a constitutional convention unless
the legislature calls the convention.</p>
<p>THE COURT: The provision itself says, simply, it shall not be changed by constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Right.</p>
<p>THE COURT: By anybody, I assume? That’s what it purports to say. That was the basis of my question to the Attorney General.</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: While I hold no brief for the proposition, those are the mentions of it.</p>
<b>[*21]</b>
<p class="P1">Now the 67th Amendment, of course, also in our judgment
was a great nullity. On its face it purported to provide each county,
in a little Federal sort of plan, with representation in the State
Senate. In the house, of the 106 members of our house of
representatives, 67 of them are also allocated on the basis of
political units, or on the basis of some sort of little Federal plan.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we look at the county argument, and the use of
counties and in the allocation of some weight to counties for
representational purposes, and it seems to me that—as has been stated
by others—that there is no comparison with the Federal Government, no
proper comparison. There was no Federal compromise, with respect to
counties. There is no, and never has been, any so–called “sovereignty”
in the counties. They’re created by the states. The counties have only
such rights as are granted by the State Legislature and by the State
Constitution. And the effect of the utilization of these political
units, it seems to me, would be rather disastrous as far as the
government of our state legislatures is concerned. It would seem to me
that over a period of history, as America developed, the United States
Senate has been an effective instrumentality of government. But it’s
extremely doubtful to me that, if the United States Senate were totally
fragmented with fractional interests, if the Senators did not run
statewide, if they did not in a State like Alabama, for instance, have
to take into consideration the industrial interests of Birmingham, the
shipping interests of Mobile, the farm interests, the plantation
interests, and perhaps the black belt, the Tennessee Valley Authority
area and the Alabama Power Company area, it would seem to me that the
representation that we might get in the Senate of the United States
might well be a mere blocking, rather than a useful sort of
representation.</p>
<p class="P1">But in most states in the Union, there is a divergence
inside of the senatorial districts, a divergence of interests that
melds itself and meshes into the Senator who comes forward. Now inside
of the State the principal usage for representative districts is to
break down into smaller and smaller units the area of representation
and the place and the people of representation, so that one
representative may at least know the will of the people whom he
represents. To me, if you go into any sense of area representation, or
any sense of political unit representation, you quite naturally have in
it a rural bias. Because it just seems implicit to me that there is
more farmland than there is city–land. And in this nation, there are
fewer farmers than there are city people. And if you use land, or if
you use political units without population being the guiding factor,
then we must of necessity reach a representative standard which will be
non–responsive to the people. And the function of <b>[*22]</b> government, of course, should be its response to the people whom it governs.</p>
<p class="P1">The difference, it seems to me, boils down to the
question of people. If in this country, as I think the country’s dream
says, if we assume that the power of self–government is the power of
people to think and to reason and to vote and to properly represent
themselves and get their own representatives, then the courts, it would
seem, would be the standard to protect the minority from the majority.
But the majority surely should have the right to elect representatives
in both houses of the legislature. If that right doesn’t exist in both
houses, then they only have equal protection of one–half of the law.</p>
<p class="P1">Now in the Alabama case—of course <i>Baker</i> v. <i>Carr</i>
was decided on March 26th—on March 30th, the District Court issued an
order setting a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction we
filed. The case moved rapidly, until April 14th there was a hearing,
and July 16th, after a special session of the legislature, there was
reapportionment.</p>
<p class="P1">I am quite convinced, in my own mind, that in the Middle
District of Alabama, the court that viewed the reapportionment case
there and found an effective remedy, and under court order had an
election held, fashioned a remedy perhaps better than we could dream
could be fashioned from far away. I am quite certain from the opinion
of the District Court that, in its mind at the moment, before your
decisions on future cases, that in its mind at the moment, population
is the standard which must be met as far as an apportionment is
concerned.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. Morgan, is it possible, under your constitutional provision of 1901, to meet that standard?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: I think it’s possible in the senate. It’s possible in
the senate, if you interpret the provision which says that no county
shall be divided into two districts. If you interpret that as a purely
anti–gerrymandering provision—and I should think that there is some
presumption in favor of the constitutionality, of course, of a state
constitution—if you read it that way and say it doesn’t mean that a
county may not be divided into districts, it says it may not be divided
between districts and split down the center or chopped up. Now, under
that assumption, your senate could be apportioned on a basis of seven
senators for Jefferson County, three for Mobile, and so forth, which
would be on the basis of pure population.</p>
<p class="P1">In the house of representatives, there is no way under
this constitution to have an absolute population apportionment, because
of the one–per–county provision there.</p>
<b>[*23]</b>
<p>THE COURT: Could it be done without gross inequalities?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Yes, I think so. And the inequalities in the house,
while in some instances they approach what I would consider
“grossness,” of course, but I think as far as a temporary measure or a
measure with respect to the usage of the State, for the next few years,
it could be—</p>
<p>THE COURT: No, I’m speaking about it permanently; because that’s the
question that the Attorney General posed to us, whether—he would like
to have us say, whether or not, under that constitutional provision of
1901, it is possible for the legislature to meet the standards of the
Federal Constitution.</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: I would say—and of course our suit has gone through
varying stages; you’ll understand, as we progressed with it, we’ve
changed our mind as to what we think the law is—I would say that quite
probably not. The provision requiring one–per–county in the house of
representatives, it would seem to me, would deprive people of their
vote on a population standard. If there’s to be any deviation from
population, in either house, of the representatives—if that were the
Court’s ruling—then it could go under the State Constitution.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You conclude, then, that both houses have to be on a population basis?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Correct.</p>
<p>THE COURT: As you said a moment ago, one house one way, one another, is unacceptable according to you?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: I should think so, yes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Of course, the difficulty with the first branch of your
answer to the Chief Justice’s question, with respect to the 1901
constitutional provision affecting the State Senate, is: The State of
Alabama has construed that constitutional provision to mean something
other than what you say.</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Well, there are other factors.</p>
<p>THE COURT: It’s construed it to mean, as I understand it, that there shall be no more than one senator in each county.</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Yes. And I might add this—</p>
<p>THE COURT: And aren’t we bound by that, as a matter of accepted—</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Well, I don’t think so, when you have a state
legislature that hasn’t abided by anything else in the same provision,
or anything else in the constitution, because—</p>
<b>[*24]</b>
<p>THE COURT: Well, aren’t we, this—at least as I understand it; you
tell me if I’m wrong—this has been clearly construed to mean what I
say. This rather ambiguous language of your constitution has been
construed in your State to mean: no more than one senator from any
county. Is that right, or not, as a matter of fact?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: I would say that, as far as common parlance is concerned, and legislators talking, and that sort of thing—</p>
<p>THE COURT: How about the judiciary? Has it spoken?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: No, no. And the only construction, I think, with force
of law would be the failure of the legislature to utilize the
provisions and to bring about more than one senator. I must say, in all
candor, that in the history of Alabama there has not been any
senatorial district which has had more than one senator.</p>
<p>THE COURT: So, in practice as well as in talk, that’s the way it’s been construed?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: In practice, and prior to the filing of this suit I
would say it was commonly accepted that Jefferson County could only
have one senator.</p>
<p>THE COURT: No county could have more than one?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: That’s right.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Didn’t the District Court, as I understand it, [Inaudible].</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: That’s correct, yes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: He started this?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Yes. Yes, and we are joined in this by intervenors Farr
and others. I’m satisfied to leave this matter to this District Court,
yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: No, sir, I do not.</p>
<blockquote>Gentlemen, in conclusion I would—</blockquote>
<p>THE COURT: May I ask you if this constitutional provision has been
interpreted by the court in a regular lawsuit, or only by statements of
the judges?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Only by—there’s been adversary proceeding involved at
all—the statements by the judges, except in, I would say probably in
the case of <i>Waid</i> v. <i>Pool,</i> where they did say that the legislature was malapportioned, but that they weren’t going to <b>[*25]</b> take jurisdiction. There was not a specific interpretation of this provision at all.</p>
<p>THE COURT: As I recall, statements by the judges in answer to an inquiry under the statute are not binding as court decisions.</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: They are not; they’re purely advisory opinions.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Purely voluntary.</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: And each of the justices could change their mind on the next one.</p>
<p>THE COURT: That is the way, isn’t it, that the court originally
sustained the constitutionality of the State Act which had authorized
inquiries to be made of the court? They sustained it, did they not, on
the basis that it would not be binding decisions as in a controversy or
case, but merely the individual views of the judges who voluntarily
gave them?</p>
<p>MR. MORGAN: Yes, sir, that’s correct.</p>
<p class="P1">In conclusion, we simply state that we do think the
District Court is competent to handle the matter and has exhibited a
great deal of speed in doing so; and we feel that the rights of all
Alabamans and all Americans rest upon the decision of this Court with
respect to whether or not people do have, on the basis that this
country was founded, for each man one vote.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Mr. Vann?</p>
<center>ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. VANN, ESQ., ON<br>
BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 27</center>
<p>MR. VANN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</p>
<p class="P1">We are intervenors in the case below; and in the court
below we joined with the plaintiffs, and I believe all of the
intervenors, in proposing to the court below that this case had reached
a stage where the remedy of provisional reapportionment, as we proposed
it, was the only effective way in which the court could deal with the
matter.</p>
<p class="P1">Previously, there were three remedies considered by the
court below: One was requiring an election–at–large after the
legislature had failed to act; there was a remedy proposed of
proportional voting of existing legislators; and there was the remedy
of provisional reapportionment—all of which we felt were within the
discretion of equity.</p>
<p class="P1">However, in practical impact, it was our contention that
for the court to set up a temporary plan which the legislature itself
could change, either before a legislature was elected under that plan
or after a legislature was elected under that plan, gave to the <b>[*26]</b>
State and to the legislature the full range of discretion; and, at the
same time, gave the litigants a full opportunity and full protection
for their constitutional standards. However, as you have noted from our
appeal, we are here in this Court, unlike Mr. Morgan, to say that we
feel that action by this Court at this time is necessary in this case.
And that is the subject that I want to discuss with you.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we come from a State that has 10 percent of the
natural resources of America—mainland America. This State has been
locked in an impass for the expression of the popular will of the
people for over 60 years. In this case, while this case was pending, we
attempted to utilize every single way that was open to us. We
backed—the Jefferson County Democratic Campaign Committee and others—we
backed proposals in the legislature. We petitioned the legislature.
When the legislature passed the Crawford–Webb Bill, we even asked the
Governor to veto it and use his power of amendment.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: We’ll recess now, Mr. Vann.</p>
<p class="P1">[Whereupon, argument in the above–entitled matter was recessed, to reconvene in the afternoon of the same day.]</p>
<center>ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. VANN, ESQ., ON<br>
BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 27—Resumed</center>
<p>MR. VANN: As I was saying before the lunch hour, our purpose in
being in this appeal is because we feel that additional relief in this
case is necessary now.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Just before we recessed for lunch, you said that you had made various efforts in the Legislature of Alabama?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: That is correct.</p>
<p>THE COURT: And I think the last thing you said was that you urged
the Governor to veto the—what do you call it?—the Crawford Bill, and to
amend the legislation. What does that mean?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: Well we have, under the Alabama Constitution, a procedure
of “Executive amendment.” The Executive can veto a bill and propose an
amendment to the bill, which if accepted by the legislature, would
avoid his veto.</p>
<p class="P1">And we asked the Governor to amend the Crawford–Webb Bill
to provide for proper reapportionment, and submit it back to the
legislature with an Executive amendment. The Governor refused to do so.</p>
<b>[*27]</b>
<p>THE COURT: So this provision means, in effect, that the Governor has
a substantial amount of potential legislative power. Is that correct?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: Yes. But the Governor’s veto in Alabama can be overridden
by a simple majority. So it’s not as effective a veto as you have in
some other states and in the Federal system.</p>
<p>THE COURT: But it’s a talking veto? A speaking veto?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: That’s right, a “talking veto.”</p>
<p class="P1">And when you have a position, as we were in, Justice
Stewart, where in the State Senate, with 20 percent of the people, we
only had—we had less than 3 percent of the representation, although we
were in near–majority status with other counties affected, we couldn’t
even effectively use those legislative devices used to protect
minorities. We don’t have enough power to even use minority protection
in the State Senate, at the present time. For example, the filibuster.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You mean a negative kind of protection?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: That’s right. The majority can’t even effectively utilize normal minority protections.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. VANN: In our judgment, no. And that is one of the points that I would like to cover in the very short time that I have.</p>
<p class="P1">One, I’d like to say we feel additional relief is needed.
And we have asked, in effect alternatively, for a direction to the
District Court to provide at least substantially population
reapportionment in the State Senate; or, we’ve asked for a declaration
from the court. A declaration—well, either remedy, we think, might
result in a legislative result before the District Court could handle
it. It would give the District Court another opportunity, if the
legislature again failed to act.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we have this situation: The senate, as provided for
in the order below, does not even eliminate the most egregious
discrimination in the senate. In other words, the fact that our county
with 20 percent of the people, means that we have one–seventh of the
voice that our population would entitle us to in the State Senate. The
Senate District of Bibb and Perry has 20 times the voice of my county.
Mobile County, which Mr. McConnell comes from, only has a third of the
voice that its population would entitle it to; and Bibb and Perry
Counties have 10 times the voice of Mobile’s.</p>
<p class="P1">Now this produces a very serious problem, and it has very <b>[*28]</b>
immediate, and very practical results. A member of the legislature is
more than a person to vote. A member of the State Senate is on
committees; he’s chairman of committees; he has powers beyond his vote
in the channeling of legislation. The existence of representation
affects your area’s relationship with the State Executive And our
county, if it please the Court, has been generally regarded by the
State as the pool from which the taxes should come and the place to
which very little of the money should return. We’d have State aid to
small counties, without the consent of the payer for that aid.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, coming to the point—and I think the crucial point—is
that pointed out by Attorney General Richmond Flowers. The crucial
point that I think has caused the legislature to be at logger–heads—it
was the crucial point that I think disturbed the District Court
below—was the provision of Section 200 of the State Constitution which
says:</p>
<blockquote>No county shall be divided between two districts, and no
district shall be made up of more than two counties not contiguous to
each other.</blockquote>
<p class="P1">Now the first line there: “No county shall be divided
between two districts,” is the point that has troubled people. Now the
appellants get around that by simply changing the language when they
quote the constitution. In their brief, at page 15 and 18, they simply
change the word “between” to “into.” This was the way they argued it
this morning, the assuming of what that word “between” means by
changing it to “into.” The Solicitor General, in his brief, merely
casts this vital point off by assuming, in his statement of facts, that
this means “into” instead of “between.” The Solicitor General, in his
brief, treats this in his footnote on page 6 by saying that this has
been interpreted by apportionment under the 1901 constitution.</p>
<p class="P1">Well, in the first place, until the Crawford–Webb Bill
was passed, there had never been an apportionment statute. You are
cited to Code provisions in the 1940 Code which appear to be a
legislative apportionment of some kind. Well, now the Legislature of
Alabama reapportioned itself almost faithfully, every 10 years, from
1920 through 1892, and the Code in existence in 1901 had a Code section
in it which set out the latest apportionment under the 1892 bill. When
the Code was revised in 1903, and again in 1923, the Code committee
simply wrote the constitutional provisions in instead of that
inaccurate Code section, which of course no longer applied. The only
semblance of anything is incorporation into the Code of our
constitution itself by our Code commit–<b>[*29]</b>tee. There’s never been a legislative act interpreting it.</p>
<p class="P1">The question has never been ruled on by the Supreme Court
of Alabama. That was another thing we did. We asked the Governor, who
had a right to ask for advisory opinions, we asked him to submit this
question to the Alabama Supreme Court, which he refused to do; because
this has been the point: When you have a group of people who hold
legislative power, they hold it in a minority basis. They’re being
asked to vote themselves out of power or to reduce their power. They
don’t want to give away any more power than they have to.</p>
<p class="P1">Now I think the Legislature of Alabama—I know many
members—is basically a fair–minded body. I think if they knew what the
standard was, we would have an excellent chance of getting a proper
bill from the Legislature. But, as long as this point—and we attempted
to get it ruled on in the court below—as long as this point is in
doubt, I think it’s almost impossible to get relief from the
legislature; and therefore I think that it is of vital importance.</p>
<p>THE COURT: How do you interpret that?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: All right, that’s what I wanted to tell you, sir.</p>
<p class="P1">The constitution, in five or six places, including this
provision in 284 which says population shall not be removed by
constitutional amendment, which is as strong a statement as the
constitutional convention could have made, repeatedly states that
population is the standard, is their goal and is their guideline.</p>
<p class="P1">Now in interpreting the instrument within its four
corners, as in accordance with Alabama practice and the cases which we
have cited in our brief to you, this provision would be interpreted as
being in line with that statement; and that would make it a provision
which is a provision against gerrymandering, which is very reasonable,
because you’ve got a group of Republican voters, or a group of pink
people, or blue people, or green people—you can’t divide them up and
tack them onto additional counties by dividing a county into fragments.</p>
<p class="P1">Now this provision originally came into the Constitution
of Alabama in substance in the original constitution. And there was
never any discussion of it on the floor of any subsequent
constitutional convention. The language got changed several times in
re–drafting, but it’s been there from the first. Now as it was
originally worded in the constitution of 1819, it said, “When a
senatorial district shall be composed of two or more counties, no
county shall be divided in forming a district,” which is exactly the
interpretation which we think the Court should place upon it today.</p>
<b>[*30]</b>
<p class="P1">Now this is an interpretation within the framework
entirely of Alabama law. Now we feel that in dealing with an historic
document of people such as the Constitution of Alabama—and it is one of
those more ancient in its origins of those of the 50 states—that the
Court should deal with it most tenderly. We believe this: We believe
that population is the standard of the Fourteenth Amendment, and we
believe the Court should place an interpretation upon our State
Constitution so as to make that Constitution—or rather as to prevent
the Constitution, from reaching a constitutional issue that would
strike its provision down unnecessarily—if this rule of construction is
applied, the Court would still adopt our interpretation.</p>
<p>THE COURT: When and why did they change that 1814 provision you just read?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: Well, I believe it was first changed in the period during
the Civil War. We had quite a series of constitutional conventions. We
had one right at the first of the Civil War, where they wrote secession
into the constitution. Then we had one under the military government at
the end of the Civil War, where they wrote abolition of slavery into
the State Constitution. And this was submitted to a vote of the people
and it didn’t pass, but the military government certified it did and we
had a bunch of confusion about that.</p>
<p class="P1">So they came back the next year, I think, and had another
constitution. During this time, this thing does not change. Then,
following the last carpetbagger constitution—if you’ll pardon me—is
what we call it in Alabama, the court, after the Tilden election, had
another convention—and I might say, that no one that attended any of
the previous conventions was at the constitution of 1875—and wrote
another constitution. And it was at that time, with no discussion, that
this change was made. And it was incorporated, without comment, into
the constitution of 1901.</p>
<p class="P1">Now I have to say this, that no county has ever had two
senators. But, at no time since 1901, has the failure to give a county
two senators produced serious ratios. There were times when someone
might be entitled to two; but 1901 was the time of the
industrialization of Jefferson County. Our City, Birmingham, did not
exist at the time of the Civil War. We had this massive growth in the
1880s, and really massive after 1901. So the problem did not attain its
serious proportions until after 1901.</p>
<p>THE COURT: When did the supreme court give its advisory opinion that it meant that you couldn’t have two counties in one—</p>
<b>[*31]</b>
<p>MR. VANN: It never has. This question has never been submitted.</p>
<p>THE COURT: That wasn’t submitted?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: No. We asked the Governor to submit it.</p>
<p>THE COURT: I see, yes.</p>
<p>MR. VANN: We asked the legislature to submit it, and they all
refused to submit it. I think they were afraid of what might be said;
and they thought they would just go along with this one senator.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Why do you ask this Court to pass on it?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: Well, you might say—you might say it leaned heavily. And
I’ve read it that way, and I’ve also read it to say just the opposite;
that’s a very confusing paragraph. It seems to me in one way the court
says that we ought to do that, but, if we did it, we would give the
people with a majority of the citizens a majority of the votes in the
senate—as if that’s some horrible result. And, with that statement, it
sort of disturbs me.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. VANN: That’s right. They say “if,” if we do this, we would have to rule this; but we’re not satisfied we should do so.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. VANN: Well, now, this is the point the Solicitor General
makes—that this is a “temporary order.” This is not a temporary order,
in my estimation. In fact, I believe that if this was a temporary
order, at least one of the appeals would not be properly before this
Court. I think we have to treat this as a final order below.</p>
<p>THE COURT: How can you say that this is not a temporary order, when the court states it to be?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: Well, it said it is a “provisional order.”</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well, what is a provisional order if it isn’t temporary?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: A provisional order is one which remains in effect until changed.</p>
<p class="P1">Now basically the court is seeking change, Your Honor, by
the legislature, of course. The legislature, of course, has many more
tools available to deal with reapportionment. They can change the
sizes, if they’re not seriously affecting the representa–<b>[*32]</b>tion
of some other county. They can deal with these problems of economy, and
so forth, and maybe shift counties around without—where there’s no
discrimination resulting. I would concede that courts can’t do that.
The court merely wants to put a plan—now I would do this: I would call
the Court’s attention to <i>Moss</i> against <i>Burkhart,</i> which
will be before the Court, I understand, later in the year. And I feel
that the court below should have done what Murrows said in that case:
That if the court is going to enter a provisional order, it should
enter one that protects our constitutional rights. As you said in the <i>Watson</i> case, Your Honor, constitutional rights are for here and now, and there must be some overwhelming reason for not doing so.</p>
<p class="P1">Well, now at the time this order was entered, the
legislature had recognized, I think, that it could not—that its bills
were not good, because they not only passed the constitutional
amendment, they not only passed the Crawford–Webb Bill, they passed the
Special Primary Act. And they said: If the legislature is reapportioned
by a court—they set up a whole special elections system, anticipating
an order from the court. The whole reapportionment of the legislature,
as it now sits, went through without one single hitch, without—none of
the boogeymen that have been raised opposing the court dealing with
this question arose. They set up a special Act. We elected the new
legislature. It’s now in session.</p>
<p class="P1">But the senate provisions are the provisions which the
court itself held were unconstitutional—and they’re not just a little
unconstitutional. They did not remove any of the most egregious
remedies.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, on its face, it appears to do more than it does,
because the Special Primary Act said, at the same time, that if a new
district has within it someone who’s already been nominated in our May
primary, he will be the nominee and there will be no election. And the
legislature has framed the whole Crawford–Webb Bill around the existing
members of the senate.</p>
<p class="P1">So, while on its surface it appears to make steps removing egregious discrimination, the two bills, <i>in pare materia,</i> sitting side by side, meant that there was no change in the senate at all.</p>
<p>THE COURT: That’s precisely what the District Court said. The
District Court said—the court said—they certainly knew what they were
doing. They didn’t make any permanent reapportioning. In other words,
they were setting up a temporary system for the election—for the ’62
election.</p>
<p>MR. VANN: Correct.</p>
<b>[*33]</b>
<p>THE COURT: But they retained jurisdiction. But, they said, what we have set up does not meet our standards.</p>
<p>MR. VANN: Correct.</p>
<p>THE COURT: We want the legislature to go ahead and meet our
standards; and, if the legislature doesn’t, we will do something
further.</p>
<p>MR. VANN: Now I said this—and let me emphasize—the legislature has
many tools to deal with reapportionment. They set up a plan under which
we are denied the equal protection of the laws, and representation, in
the forming of a permanent plan.</p>
<p class="P1">In other words, the court has set it up leaving in
control the same people who don’t want to give up the power. And
they’re going to—we must assume, under the natural course of
events—they are going to devise a permanent plan, if they do, which
limits us just as much as they think they can get away with in this
Court. I mean, we have to make this assumption, I believe; and I
believe that we’re entitled to equal protection in the formation of
that plan, and that’s the reason I—</p>
<p>THE COURT: What was your proposed remedy to the court? What would you have the lower court do?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: I would have the court—the court below, I think, would
have one of several choices. And I think that the discretion of that
court should be recognized.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Could the court order an election–at–large, pending—</p>
<p>MR. VANN: The court needs to order no election. I don’t believe the
court should order an election–at–large, because I believe this is a
chaotic form of election where you’re electing 105 members of one
house, 135 of others. You’ll have many areas of the State with no
representation at all. I could go on. These are the reasons I object to
election–at–large, and feel that this is a much more conservative
remedy; but they could treat that. They could modify this. We have a
special election procedure, for instance, if the appellants should win
in this case and if you were to unseat by reversal the 10 new
legislators from my county, there would be vacancies. The law provides
the Governor shall call a special election to fill the vacancies in the
legislature. If the court below gave us the proper representation, the
laws of Alabama are in existence. The court has to do nothing but
require the Governor to call a special election to fill those
vacancies. You can, without disruption, without any court supervision
of elections or anything of that nature, make the correction.</p>
<b>[*34]</b>
<p class="P1">Or, the other remedy which was rejected below: that you
could use proportional voting in the present legislature, without
affecting its members at all. Since the next election is a long way
off, you could give the one senator from Jefferson County seven votes
in this matter, and effect equal proportions by proportional voting.
This was a remedy suggested by <i>amicus</i> brief below.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Would you multiply his committee assignments by seven?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: We couldn’t do that. And this is the reason we objected to
proportional voting, below, and that we felt with an election coming on
that this was impractical, since he couldn’t serve on any more
committees than he had time to serve on.</p>
<p>THE COURT: May I ask you: An election was held in 1962?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: That’s correct.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Under this court order? I mean in conformity with this?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: It was held under this Special Primary Act, and it was a regular general election.</p>
<p>THE COURT: But the apportionment was as created by this District Court’s decree, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: That’s correct.</p>
<p>THE COURT: An election in conformity with that.</p>
<p class="P1">Now what are the terms of the legislature? How long are they going to sit—is that legislature going to sit?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: All members serve for four years.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Four years, both house and senate?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: They have three more years to serve. This is a long time.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Both house and senate?</p>
<p>MR. VANN: That’s right. They’ve already passed more taxes than any other legislature in history.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Very well.</p>
<p class="P1">Mr. McConnell?</p>
<center>ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. McCONNELL, JR., ESQ.,<br>
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 41</center>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Court:</p>
<b>[*35]</b>
<p class="P1">We, as appellants, were also intervenors as plaintiffs in
the action below. We have brought this appeal for the simple and sole
purpose of, as we stated in our brief, of what the lower court did not
say rather than what it did say. It may have been intimated, and
perhaps implicit, on some of these things such as the question of
dividing a county to give more equality of representation in the
senate, but we feel that the Court—this Court—should set out guidelines
for either the lower court or the legislature. We believe—and I think
the appearance here of the Attorney General intimates—that whatever the
Court gives as a minimum apportionment will be the maximum
apportionment that you receive in the legislature. We believe that it
needs guidelines and standards.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we’ve been here for two days talking on this problem.
Many interesting questions have arisen. And I would like to take the
brief time that has been allotted to this appellant to perhaps answer
some of those questions.</p>
<p class="P1">First, we are here as individual citizens. I do not claim
to represent an urban area, a certain occupation within that. I am
first a citizen of the State of Alabama. I am second, a lawyer. Someone
else may be first a citizen, and second a banker. But what we are
talking about here is protection of individual, civil, private rights.</p>
<p class="P1">We think there’s a difference between apportionment and
selection of the unit to be represented. We believe—and I believe it
was Mr. Justice Brandeis that said—that one of the strengths and
advantages of our system was that we had 50 laboratories in which
various political theories could be tried. And we think that that
should be strengthened, and that no restriction should be placed on the
individual states working out their own form of government.</p>
<p class="P1">But, within constitutional standards and limitations, you
may have experimentation—I believe it was Mr. Justice Stewart asked us
yesterday—experimentation in the unit of representation. But once that
unit is determined, there can be no experimentation in the equality of
representation from that unit. I believe it was Mr. Justice Stewart who
asked yesterday about a six–house legislature. We are talking here
governmental processes. We are asking for equality in the governmental
process. We say you may have a multi–number executive, a council, so
long as each individual citizen has equality of representation in each
of the members of that multi–number executive.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Are there any states which, in fact, have governor’s
councils which are appointive rather than elective, and which have
considerable legislative power?</p>
<b>[*36]</b>
<p>MR. McCONNEL: I recall the question yesterday, Mr. Justice Stewart,
and I’m not aware or familiar with one that does, that has any
legislative power. But again—</p>
<p>THE COURT: I don’t know. The New England states, a good many of
them, have governor’s councils—they’re called by various names—with
more or less political power, and I think, legislative power.</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Well, again now, we would not say that that would be
unconstitutional. I would have to look at the method of selection and
the voice that that council has. Because—well, take in <i>Gray</i> versus <i>Sanders,</i> where you say it’s a unit–wide election, it’s an election of statewide officials. You say that the vote must count equal.</p>
<p class="P1">Let’s just say that there had been nothing but direct
counting. Then you remove it one process and you have a counting of
votes; and then you have a second counting in which the first votes are
changed into a new ratio. Now I think you could apply that to your
council that you’re speaking of, if the Governor, say, who was elected
directly by everyone—statewide vote—should select half of those council
members, and the other half were hereditary, then that council would
not be constitutional because the citizens who had an equal voice in
the selection of the Governor only had an equal voice in the selection
of half of the members of that council; the other half, he had no
participation.</p>
<p class="P1">Now our point here, and our sole point on appeal, is that
we think that population must be the initial controlling guide; and
that that must be in every stage of the legislative process. If it’s
unicameral, it’s satisfied if you have equal voice in one house. If
it’s bicameral, such as it is in Alabama, there must be equality in
each house, because both houses are necessary to enact laws. If we have
equal voice in only one house, and no voice, and your question happens
to be home rule—if you had home rule for Mobile County that I represent
here, if there was just one right such as Congressional redistricting
which will face this Court in the next few days—that is done by the
State Legislature. We would be deprived, in Mobile County, of our
equality in the legislative process if, simply because we had home rule
on everything but Congressional districting, did not have an equal
voice in the legislature in the districting of the State for
Congressional elections.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Does your argument lead to this: that if a state wanted
also to pursue the policy of guaranteeing as a unit every county a seat
in the legislature, the legislature would have to be large enough so
that the population could mathematically prevail?</p>
<b>[*37]</b>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Your Honor, That’s our point. And that’s the reason that we are not even satisfied.</p>
<p class="P1">Now the other appellants are here principally because of
the senate. We concur in what they say in the senate, but we also do
not believe that the apportionment of the house of representatives in
Alabama allowing one representative per county first will give us
equality in the legislative process. The figures—I think there may be a
conflict—but it’s roughly a little better than 40 percent, which is
about what New York is arguing here on theirs. But that’s after the
lower court did comply with our constitutional provisions, and we say
that it’s not necessarily gross. We say you start with population.</p>
<p class="P1">But we recognize—and without disagreeing with Mr. Justice
Stewart—it may not be eighth grade arithmetic on the first part, but I
believe that eighth grade arithmetic will determine the ratio. Now
which ratio, and where you stop, we recognize this point that Mr.
Justice Goldberg just raised: the size of the house—if in Alabama you
take 106, we have 3,200,000 people. You divide it. You get a ratio of
about 30,000 per representative. Now we recognize that there will have
to be administrative deviations from an exact 30,800 per
representative, and that there is leeway there; but we won’t go so far
as to say that that leeway must be gross before the court will strike
it down. You’ll look at why the leeway, and if it’s simply to keep one
precinct from one county from being taken out of the county and put in
another to equalize the districts, you may say that that’s all right.
But it doesn’t have to become what, in the past, we have termed “gross”
for the court to act.</p>
<p class="P1">The question of proportional voting: We feel that the
State could establish, constitutionally, proportional voting. We feel
that they could establish a three–house legislature, one on geography,
one on occupation, one on something else. But in each house, where it’s
proportional also, it would have to be that each voter or each citizen
in the State would have to have equality in the representative in each
house.</p>
<p class="P1">You mentioned management and labor. If you could divide
the State of Alabama into two groups in which management was two–thirds
and labor was one–third, you could have a house made up of occupations.
But two–thirds would have to be elected by management and one–third by
the other.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Could a State, under the Constitution under the
Fourteenth Amendment, just say: We’re not going to have any legislative
assembly; we’re going to give all our legislative power to the governor?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: It gets then—and that’s also an important <b>[*38]</b>
question here, of this checks and balances. I don’t think there’s
anything necessarily in the Fourteenth Amendment that would say that
you had to have separation of powers that we’ve traditionally had
between executive and legislature. But it would say that, if you put
that power in one, each citizen in the state must have equality in the
selection and in the voice of that particular representative, be it
governor or if you gave the administrative powers to the legislature.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Presumably, under <i>Gray</i> against <i>Sanders,</i> there would be a statewide general election for governor?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Every person’s vote counting equally, every qualified
voter’s vote counting equally, you think under the Constitution a state
could say: You have all the legislative power and all the executive
power in this state?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: I haven’t actually checked into that, but it does
come back to the question that was raised yesterday. If I might answer
it this way—and I agree with Mr. Justice Goldberg—that I think that the
republican guarantee clause does have a place here.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we don’t want to make a case of this republican
guarantee, recognizing the past decisions of the Court as to
justiciability, but we do believe that, in answer to Mr. Justice
Harlan, where do we find this in the Constitution? The Federal
Constitution mentions only one form of government. You can check, from
the beginning to the end, and that is the republican form.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we say, having mentioned that, then we can look back,
regardless of the question of whether it’s a guarantee or not. We’re
not saying “enforce the guarantee here,” but as a measure, a standard
of what type of government, of what type of equal protection are we
talking about in the Fourteenth? We can look back to the only form that
the Constitution has mentioned. And I don’t believe that you’ll find in
the <i>Federalist Papers</i> others. You will find a discussion, under
the guarantee clause there, the question of equal representation. I
don’t believe we find a question there of division of powers between
the executive and the legislature. But you will find—and that was not
quoted, though, in the Appendix B that the Solicitor General has filed
in the Maryland case—<i>Federalist Paper No. 39,</i> I believe it is that he quotes, does not quote an earlier paragraph in there relative to equal representation.</p>
<p class="P1">But that is our position: That you can experiment on the
different forms, but there can be no experimentation in which the
equality is diluted or taken away; that in the governmental process—now
we’re only talking about one, here, that’s the legislative <b>[*39]</b>
process—but to us, it’s unthinkable that we can speak of equal
protection of the laws in which the citizen does not have equal
participation in that law.</p>
<p class="P1">And we also wish to emphasize here that there’s a
difference between affirmative and negative powers of government. As
we’ve pointed out in our brief, we feel that a government that is not
able to act is not a just government. We’ve seen what happened in
Alabama, the failure to act, for 60 years. What may have been just in
1901 is no longer just now. But what we have here is not protection of
the minority against the abuses of the majority. You have minority
control, so that there can be no affirmative action.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we think that there’s room for experimentation on the
checks and balances of extraordinary majorities, under certain
circumstances, of providing even that a bill would have to pass, say,
two legislatures in order to provide time for consideration. But don’t
put it in a straitjacket so that even when a majority do want a
particular governmental policy that that majority is not able to
transmit its desire into law. And we say that this is not protection of
minorities; it’s actually giving the minorities process, which we say
is not due process.</p>
<p>THE COURT: At this point, you’re arguing to the effect that the
failure of a state to take affirmative action is a denial of equal
protection of the law? The failure denies equal protection. Is that
correct?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Yes, sir, we most certainly do. When the effect of
that failure to act results in what it has resulted in in Alabama, it’s
certainly a denial of equal protection. And, as I said, we believe that
the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the
entire legislative process, which in Alabama is both houses. As we
pointed out, you can initiate legislation in either house—except tax
measures—but it requires both houses to affirmatively adopt any bill;
and therefore to give equality in one house, and to deny equality in
the second house, is to deny equality in the entire legislative
process; because one–half of equality does not give you equality.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Would you have equality under the 1901 provision, Mr. McConnell?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: You mean if we followed the wording of the 1901 constitution?</p>
<p>THE COURT: Yes.</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: We maintain that you could not, Your Honor, in the house.</p>
<b>[*40]</b>
<p class="P1">Now we concur in the other appellants’ argument of the
interpretation that could be given to the senate provisions, which we
think would square that without declaring it unconstitutional; but, in
the house, where you have a provision that each county must have at
least one representative, then we maintain—and as the Attorney General
pointed out, that he gave—that he followed a method that we think is
fair: the method of equal proportions in allotting the representatives
to the house of representatives. But even then, Houston County had 1
representative for 50,000; Coosa County, with only 10,000 population,
has 1 representative. That’s the worst, 5 to 1 ratio, even with what we
say is a fair method. But once you start by giving 67 representatives
to the existing 67 counties, one to each, then you make it impossible
to give equality of representation in the remaining seats.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we also pointed out in our brief the fact that the
legislature can achieve the 67th senatorial amendment simply by
legislative act. The constitution provides an upper limit on the size
of the house, but no lower limit. They could provide, therefore, a
house of 67 members, in which then each county would be entitled to 1.
You would end up with a 67–member house, in which the largest would
have a population of 634,000; the smallest, 10,000.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we believe that the constitutional convention in 1901
in Alabama, if you look at the proceedings—and we’ve cited them in a
footnote in our brief, the pages to the constitutional convention—if
you look at the provisions themselves, throughout the delegates to that
convention recognized the fairness of population. Every provision even
down to the formation of new counties, they had a provision in there
that no county could be formed unless it had enough people in the new
county to the ratio of population to get it one representative; or that
left the old county, or counties from which it was taken with a ratio
of representation entitling it to one. So that they even thought about
this thing of taking in new counties. They couldn’t dilute the vote
unless that new county came in with a population sufficient to entitle
it to at least one representative. But to your question, Mr. Chief
Justice: We do not believe that, on the house, that a conformity with
the provisions of the Alabama Constitution would meet the
constitutional standards of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we, as I said, asked the lower court to declare this
in our original petition—to declare these guidelines—because, as the
Attorney General has pointed out here, there is—well, and we’ve seen
and the State of Alabama in its brief, in its brief here, has pointed
out—that one session of the legislature has gone by with this
reapportioned legislature that didn’t get anywhere with a further
reapportionment. Now we believe that not only is further ac–<b>[*41]</b>tion
necessary—and we do recognize the concluding paragraph of the court
that the court, in about as strong language as it could, stated that it
was going to do something if the legislature didn’t—but we do believe
that either the lower court or the legislature needs a guideline, a
criteria, a standard by which to measure what they do and what they
must do in order to conform to the requirements of the Fourteenth
Amendment.</p>
<p class="P1">We think that the wording, as contained in this section
of the Alabama Constitution, and by constitutional amendments, and what
they wrote in, that population shall be the basis of representation,
and that it cannot be changed by constitutional amendment—in there it
says, “as nearly as may be”—and we think that, although we are arguing
numbers, numbers is a safe guide here for determining whether or not we
meet that standard. But we don’t say mathematical exactitude is
necessary. In other words, “as nearly as may be.” In the perfect
set–up, in an election–at–large, every man’s vote counts once. If you
break into that down into two districts—</p>
<p>THE COURT: Are you suggesting that that would be the perfect set–up for electing an assembly—all of them to be elected at–large?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: No, sir. I didn’t mean that in applying to—I agree
with the others, that we would have chaos if you had to elect 106
members of the house and 35 members of the senate.</p>
<p>THE COURT: And what you’d probably have, all of them—all of them representing a couple of the big counties.</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Well of course there—and this is another reason that
we emphasize, and it ran through the thread of the New York case—I can
only speak for Alabama, but we emphasize that we’re here for
individuals. There are many people in my County, many people in
Jefferson County, who are happy with the rural domination of the
legislature. So we’re not unanimous.</p>
<p>THE COURT: In other words, you’re saying that those rural
legislators more truly represent some of the voters in Birmingham than
does your own representative?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Well, I say “more truly represent.” They don’t like
these taxes that come out; but they may like some of the other things.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we pay more than our share of taxes than does the
rest of the State; but that’s just the sort of tribute you pay to get
other types of laws with which they do agree—but that’s just facing the
practicalities of the situation.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, if you got into proportional representation which you mentioned, there might be some way. I say that you can experiment <b>[*42]</b>
there but, regardless of how you do it, you’ve still got to end up—when
the representative gets there, he must represent either an equal
number, or each person must have an equal share of the representative;
either way you want to put it.</p>
<p class="P1">Now this proportional voting that you mentioned that was proposed, the court asked <i>amicus</i>
to brief this, on proportional voting in the legislature. We opposed it
for the simple reason that you asked about: committee assignments;
others are filibuster. There are many ways. By the same token, we think
that it would be unfair if you gave Jefferson County and Mobile County
the proper number of representatives and senators, then after they got
there you told them they had to vote by county. Suppose we got seven,
and then you say: All right, now, you can go to your committees, you
can filibuster, but when it comes to voting we’re going to have a “unit
rule”—which we think is a perfect illustration of what we say is a
denial of equality in the legislative process. But we think that it has
to be there in both houses.</p>
<p class="P1">And although we do not like to argue that our
constitutional provision violates the Fourteenth Amendment we do
believe that there is not any one principle that can apply in the State
of Alabama. We don’t have near the urban characteristics of New York.
As was pointed out in the Solicitor General’s brief, the 9 largest
counties here in Alabama have just about 50 percent of the population;
and those 9 are from one end of the State to the other and do not
necessarily represent common interests or common views and would
probably not act together, or would rarely act together. But we believe
that the present constitutional provisions, with regard to the house of
representatives in Alabama, do not meet the standards required by the
Fourteenth Amendment. And we believe that either this Court should so
declare or for the lower court then to act—now we, my particular
appellants, recommend a solution there: It’s an experimentation in the
type of unit, but it ends up with equality of representation. It may be
a little difficult to administer, but we think there’s even a way that
you can conform to the Alabama requirements and give equality in the
house of representatives.</p>
<p class="P1">But we say, what we ask here is, that this Court set out
the standard and the guidelines for either the legislature or the lower
court to follow in apportionment, but that basic to it must be—and this
was the thing that worries me, when they cited <i>Fortson,</i> a Georgia case, and even <i>Scholle</i> versus <i>Hare,</i>
and others—a question in the court’s mind as to whether or not both
houses of a bicameral legislature had to be apportioned to give
equality of representation in each house. And it was that type of
language, that concern by the lower court was the principal reason why
I appealed <b>[*43]</b> here, because we believe that you do not
satisfy it in a bicameral legislature unless you have quality of
representation in both.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we take it, from <i>Gray</i> versus <i>Sanders,</i>
that it starts out with the idea of one man–one vote, and statewide.
But we do not believe that, simply by raising it to another level—to a
representative—that you can dilute that equality that you started with
in the governmental process—here, the legislative process—dilute it by
passing it through something that makes it come out with a different
ratio or a different percentage at the next level. Just as the county
unit, after all—suppose they had elected people statewide, just like
the electors on the Federal level. Those electors then, in Georgia,
would have had a certain number of votes based on the county units. The
Georgia voter would have had equality in selecting the electors, but
that equality in the final analysis would have been taken away. But we
urge the Fourteenth Amendment applies to both houses of a bicameral
legislature.</p>
<p>THE COURT: If I get your argument, what you’re really saying is, <i>Gray</i> against <i>Sanders</i> determines this case.</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: No, sir, I don’t say I was glad to see <i>Gray</i> versus <i>Sanders.</i></p>
<p>THE COURT: Naturally.</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: I won’t say it determines it, but I certainly think
that, if you start with the proposition there that in a statewide
office that each vote should count as one, I think that it applies.
Because that’s basic, in the idea of self–government or a
representative government, that each citizen is equal in that
participation. And the only way you can carry that over into the
legislature is to make that equality start with the vote for the
representative and in the voice of the representative in the
legislature.</p>
<p>THE COURT: A legislator, an individual legislator, has a constituency which is not statewide.</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: That’s right, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: He’s not a statewide officer.</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: But <i>Gray</i> versus <i>Sanders</i> says that you must give each constituent—</p>
<p>THE COURT: “Within any given constituency,” and in that case it was the State.</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: But, as I said, I am a citizen of the State of
Alabama. I may live in the County of Mobile. I am represented in a
legislature that makes laws for the entire State. Now, if my voice—</p>
<b>[*44]</b>
<p>THE COURT: But you have one or more representatives, with respect to your constituency.</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: I have representatives. But when they get to the
law–making body in Montgomery, they speak with a voice unequal to that
of the adjacent county. I can move across the county line, and suddenly
my participation changes materially. But I am first a citizen of the
State of Alabama. I am subject to laws made by one legislature, and all
I ask as a citizen is equal participation in that lawmaking process.</p>
<p class="P1">I believe my time is up—Yes, sir?</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Well, I would like, first, Mr. Justice White, that
this Court declare that the Fourteenth Amendment sets up first a
standard of population, which can be deviated from only under the most
compelling—and I would even—</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: No, sir. I don’t think it went far enough. I think that, as Mr. Vann said earlier—</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Not to go back to the one prior to that, but to go
forward to one that would comply with a guideline that this Court would
set out, namely that—</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Yes, sir, that is what we would ask. Population equal as to both houses, yes, sir.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: I certainly do, Your Honor. I do, because in the
house it will still give only 40 percent. And if you look at the tables
attached to the court’s opinion, it shows a trend of population that is
going to get worse rather than better, and that this 40 percent may go
down.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Oh, yes, sir; yes, sir, I agree, and I commend the
court. After all, it was pioneering in a new field. And I’m not
criticizing the court for not going any farther. I want it to, and I
want this Court to because—simply because it didn’t go far enough.
But—I approve of what they did, but ask for more.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<b>[*45]</b>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Yes, sir, to this extent: Under the law that Mr. Vann
mentioned—and it’s interesting. If you look, they provided machinery
for just this thing. So that if there are any vacancies you simply have
an election in those counties, the district in which they are, so there
wouldn’t be a complete turnover. In fact, the invalidation of the
Webb–Crawford in the senate, resulted in only one election for the
senate.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Special election?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Special election.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: That’s right. Subsequent to the meeting of the
legislature, no, Your Honor; the legislature adjourned in September.
This case had already been set down. And, as far as I know, no effort
has been made in the lower court since the adjournment of the last
legislature.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. McConnell, do you read the court’s opinion below as
accepting as a part of a future permanent remedy the 67th amendment
provisions with regard to the house? When the court gets around to a
permanent, to a permanent solution, do you feel from its opinion—does
the opinion seem to you that it would start by accepting that 67th
amendment for the house?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: That is what troubled us, Your Honor, because, if you
notice on page 151 of the record, it says: “The result may well be that
representation according to population to <i>some extent</i>”—and the court italicized that in its opinion—“<i>to some extent</i> must be required in <i>both</i>
houses”—and it italicized “both.” This is in the middle of the page
there—“if invidious discrimination in the legislative systems as a
whole”—now we agree with that “as a whole,” but this “to some extent”
worries me; because I think that the court may be, as the Attorney
General would be, satisfied with the house being apportioned in
accordance with the requirements of the 1901 constitution and the
Webb–Crawford and the 67th amendment provision. I would read that as
“not clear,” but I think it’s open to that inference.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. McConnell, how many counties would there be, in the
event your view prevailed, that did not have a representative?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: Well, Mr. Justice Clark, in one of the footnotes, we
just point out that out of the 67 counties only 27 have a population in
excess of the ratio of 30,000 per representative. If you divide 106
into our population, only 27 would be entitled to 1. <b>[*46]</b> The remaining 40, except for a few—some of them are close to the line and you might, for administrative reasons—</p>
<p>THE COURT: They’d be floating districts?</p>
<p>MR. McCONNELL: They would have to be floating districts—so it would be over half of the counties.</p>

<p class="P1">Mr. Solicitor General?</p>
<center>ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARCHIBALD COX, ESQ., ON<br>BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS<br>CURIAE, URGING AFFIRMANCE</center>
<p>MR. COX: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</p>
<p class="P1">Before I come to my argument proper, I want to comment
very briefly on two points with respect to which our brief may be
misleading.</p>
<p class="P1">First is this question concerning the interpretation of
the provision in the State Constitution: “No county shall be divided
between two districts, and no district shall be made up of two or more
counties not contiguous to each other.” It’s the first half of that
that we’re concerned with. We have assumed in our brief that this meant
that no county could have more than one senator.</p>
<p class="P1">Now I did not—we made the assumption, partly because it
seemed to make the case hardest against us; we made the assumption also
because we understood, perhaps wrongly, that that was the
interpretation people in Alabama put on it—I did not mean to be arguing
that that was the right interpretation. Indeed, as I read it as an
outsider, it seemed to me it was an extraordinary interpretation and
that I would have read it the other way.</p>
<p>THE COURT: This goes harder against you?</p>
<p>MR. COX: I thought it made it a somewhat harder case for us, yes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Why was that?</p>
<p>MR. COX: To read it the way they do? Because—</p>
<p>THE COURT: You say that one county, that you assume at least one county per senator? Or one senator per county?</p>
<p>MR. COX: Yes.</p>
<b>[*47]</b>
<p>THE COURT: It’s easier for you.</p>
<p>MR. COX: Well, I didn’t think so, but maybe I’m wrong. I thought, at
least reading it that way, Alabama could say that in the Crawford–Webb
Act, and some of these things, it was conforming to its own
constitution; and it also could cite as support for what it’s doing the
provisions in a good many state constitutions that do say that a county
can have only one senator. And it seemed to me that those things cut
against us.</p>
<p class="P1">The only point I’m really trying to make is that I do not
want to seem to be expressing a considered view on this question. It’s
a question of Alabama law. And I’m one of the least–equipped, by
background or experience or anything else, to have a view on it. I just
wanted to make it plain that we don’t argue either way.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Your view does seem to be, though, Mr. Solicitor General,
unless you’ve changed it—I’m reading from the footnote 13 at the bottom
of page 22, the very last clause after “Senator,” and you said that,
“The State’s own interpretation is to the contrary.” That is, the
State’s own interpretation is that there should be no more than one
senator in any one county; and it’s plainly controlling.</p>
<p class="P1">Now have you changed that view, as to how the State has—</p>
<p>MR. COX: After listening to what has been said here about the
Alabama understanding and Alabama practice, I’m bound to say that that
raises some question in my mind as to whether that is the State’s own
interpretation. That was the point I was trying to make. You bring it
out very well.</p>
<p class="P1">The other point on which I think I was guilty of some
misunderstanding is in those statements in which I said that it was
questionable whether the Crawford–Webb Act had become effective. Upon
rethinking that, it seems to me that it is quite clear that it would
become effective as of the 1966 election; and that the statements that
say that this was intended to take effect only if the constitutional
amendment were voted down, are inconsistent with the words of the
Crawford–Webb Act. It says it shall take effect as of the 1966
election, with no “ifs, ands, or buts.” So that the constitutional
amendment, I take it, would be sort of a condition subsequent, rather
than its defeat being a condition precedent.</p>
<p class="P1">I don’t think these are matters, either of them, matters
that go to the essence. But I didn’t want to be guilty of misleading
the Court.</p>
<p class="P1">Now I do come to the points that we wanted to develop.
Our position, as stated in the brief, is that the judgment below should
be affirmed. There are a number of issues of the case—three on ap–<b>[*48]</b>portionment.
But I think it all falls easily into place, if we take up the questions
in the same sequence in which they came before the District Court, that
they had to face them. And I shall attempt to relate each of those
issues to the basic thesis that I sought expound yesterday.</p>
<p class="P1">The first question in the District Court was whether the
apportionment in effect in Alabama then—the 1901 apportionment—violated
the equal protection clause. It’s quite plain, I think, and you see
that it is hardly argued that that apportionment violated the equal
protection clause, under the second principle that I sought to state
yesterday, in other words, that it discriminates between people. They
stand unequally before the election law, without any rhyme or reason,
without any justification for the inequality. And under <i>Baker</i> and <i>Carr,</i>
the Court has power to adjudicate that—and would, we should think,
without any question, hold that that apportionment is unconstitutional.
We’ve given the evidence that it’s a crazy–quilt in our brief. I see no
need to take the time to give the Court a mass of figures here.</p>
<p class="P1">The question then arose: What remedy should the District
Court direct? The legislature had already considered this question, by
reason of the fact that the District Court, before it made a firm
adjudication, had indicated its views in an opinion, and the
legislature had done three things:</p>
<p class="P1">First, it had provided no role for the November 1962
election, and there was a legislature to be elected then. It did pass a
law indicating that if the court should direct an apportionment, then
the State election would be conducted in accordance with that
apportionment, which in effect indicated that the State was prepared to
fit in with what the court must do. Second, the legislature put up to
the people the so–called “67–senator amendment,” to be voted in
November 1962. And, third, it enacted the Crawford–Webb Act that I
referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="P1">Now it would seem to me that, at this point, the District
Court was required to consider the 67–senator amendment, not as an
effective provision—because it hadn’t been ratified by the people; and
I suppose ordinarily a court wouldn’t pass on, a Federal court wouldn’t
pass on the constitutionality of something that hadn’t become effective
law—but here the court was under an obligation to shape any decree it
might enter as closely to the desire of the people of Alabama, as
expressed through their public organs, as it was able. And the prime
rating, if I may use that expression, that the legislature—the best
authority in Alabama, subject to criticism as it might be, as
unrepresentative—had indicated that the apportionment in the 67–senator
amendment was the one that it thought was most desirable. And if that
did not infringe on the plaintiffs’ con–<b>[*49]</b>stitutional rights,
then I would think that it would have been an error of law for the
District Court not to have incorporated that in its decree, or at least
permit the election to have been conducted in accordance with that
apportionment.</p>
<p class="P1">So the court was obliged to consider whether the
67–senator amendment would infringe upon the plaintiffs’ constitutional
rights. It was obliged to consider the Crawford–Webb Act for the same
reason. Now, of course, the 1962 election has been held. But the
Crawford–Webb Act is still a reality with respect to the 1966 election,
and therefore would have to be considered.</p>
<p class="P1">So I think that both those apportionments are before the
Court properly for consideration, just as if they were effective law.
The 67–senator amendment, we say, is invalid because it makes
classifications or differentiations that, within the usual equal
protection standards, are arbitrary and capricious. I point out that
something may be arbitrary or capricious for at least three reasons
that correspond to the second, third, and fourth of the propositions I
outlined yesterday.</p>
<p class="P1">Something may be arbitrary and capricious because there’s
no intelligible foundation; it’s just as if you threw dice or had some
other system like that. That’s not applicable to the 67–senator
amendment. It does have a rule, both with respect to the senate and
with respect to the house of representatives. The rule in the senate,
you’ll recall, is, “one from each county”; the rule in the house is,
“one from each county,” and then the rest according to population.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Does this mean it does not violate the “crazy–quilt” doctrine?</p>
<p>MR. COX: I think it does not violate the “crazy–quilt” doctrine.</p>
<p>THE COURT: You do?</p>
<p>MR. COX: Yes. That doesn’t mean it’s good, but it’s not bad, on that ground.</p>
<p>THE COURT: It doesn’t violate the “crazy–quilt” doctrine?</p>
<p>MR. COX: Right. I think, in addition, Mr. Justice Stewart, that it
does not violate the doctrine that I stressed yesterday in the New York
case.</p>
<p>THE COURT: The no–rhyme–or–reason doctrine?</p>
<p>MR. COX: No, that’s the “crazy–quilt” doctrine.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Oh. They’re synonymous?</p>
<p>MR. COX: They’re identical. They’re just two ways of saying the same thing.</p>
<b>[*50]</b>
<p class="P1">Let me just intrude two or three sentences. Perhaps I can
manage to make what I’ve been trying to say clear. I take it that
something may be arbitrary and capricious, even though intelligible, in
the sense that the lines that it draws, the differentiation, has no
relation to any, no rational relationship, to any permissible
legislative purpose. That is true in <i>Brown</i> against <i>Board of Education.</i>
It's ture in any number of cases, that there is an intelligible
differentiation, a pattern. And I say that if there is a pattern, while
it does not violate the “crazy–quilt” doctrine, still it is an
irrational differentiation if the criteria bear no rational
relationship to a permissible legislative purpose.</p>
<p class="P1">Now we say that the New York apportionment of the senate
bore no rational relationship, when you examined it closely, to any
permissible legislative purpose. Because the purposes that were claimed
for it—keeping the size of the counties small; giving people access to
their representatives; and so forth—were purposes that it had no
tendency to accomplish it, when you examined it. The districts were
getting bigger. What it did was create a class society in a political
sense. It attempted to say that one class of people should have more
votes than another. And that was its only function. And that, we say,
is a denial of equal protection. It is not related to any permissible
legislative purpose.</p>
<p class="P1">Now the 67–senator amendment is not bad, on this ground,
Mr. Justice, in our view. It has a rational tendency to do two things,
or three things, I suppose. It does—it has a tendency to assure that
each county will have at least one representative, while at the same
time the legislature does not get so big as to be unmanageable. And I
have assumed that those are not only intelligible, but permissible
purposes of legislative apportionment. And in the case of the one
senator for each county, it again tends to do the same thing.</p>
<p class="P1">So the question arises, at this point—</p>
<p>THE COURT: With respect to the senate, that’s the limit of what it proposes? One senator for each county?</p>
<p>MR. COX: That’s all, yes.</p>
<p class="P1">Now the house, it really combines two things: population, and one for each county.</p>
<p>THE COURT: In the house, it gives one member to each county, then the overflow in population?</p>
<p>MR. COX: The overflow in population, that’s right.</p>
<p>THE COURT: And the limit is on the total size, of what, 135?</p>
<b>[*51]</b>
<p>MR. COX: 105.</p>
<p>THE COURT: 105.</p>
<p>MR. COX: And 67 of them are distributed, 1 for each county, which
leaves you another 38 to distribute by population. It results, as I’ll
point out in a moment, in—the majority might be elected by, I think it
is 41 percent, by counties having 41 percent of the population. In the
senate, it’s much, much smaller. The senate is less than 20 percent.</p>
<p class="P1">This brings us to a further sense in which I think
something may be an unreasonable or arbitrary and capricious
differentiation, and that is when the objectives, to put it generally,
that the law seeks to accomplish are so trivial, so inconsequential, in
relation to the interests that are being sacrificed, that anyone would
say that that is an unreasonable and arbitrary balance that has been
struck. And, in an effort to incorporate that into language suitable to
the apportionment problems, we suggested as our fourth proposition that
the equal protection clause is violated by an apportionment which
subordinates the principle of popular representation and majority rule
to other permissible objectives of apportionment to such a degree as to
create gross inequalities in per capita representation and give control
of the legislature to representatives chosen by very small minorities
of the people.</p>
<p class="P1">In applying this principle, the legislature, we think,
must be judged as a whole. One must have a rule that would be
applicable to a unicameral legislature. There, clearly, you would judge
it as a whole. On the other hand, I think, in attempting to give more
meaning to that general statement, it’s appropriate to take into
account that it will generally have to be applied to bicameral
legislatures in this country—not invariably, but generally. And it’s
appropriate to see how it would apply to them. So that we suggest two
subordinate comments to the generalization.</p>
<p class="P1">First, we assume, because there’s no need to hold
otherwise in these cases, that when one house of the legislature is
apportioned substantially according to population, then we assume that
the Fourteenth Amendment may leave considerable room in the other house
for taking these other permissible purposes into account. On the other
hand, we submit that it would require the very strongest kind of
showing of other purposes, the need for fulfilling them, and their
importance, to justify substantial departures from per capita equality
and the sacrifice of majority rule in both houses of the legislature.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<b>[*52]</b>
<p>MR. COX: Well, I would think that majority rule will not operate 100
percent unless you have per capita equality in both houses. That’s
quite clear. But I was not suggesting that there must be majority rule
in the legislature; I was saying that you couldn’t subordinate it too
far to these other objectives.</p>
<p>THE COURT: What’s “too far”?</p>
<p>MR. COX: Well, I think that is something—without sounding
facetious—I think that has to be decided in each case. In these cases,
it is “very, very far,” as I will attempt to show; and it is in both
houses.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. COX: I would think there was no denial of equal protection. I
haven’t thought of the case before, but it seems to me that all voters,
all population, are being treated alike. It would be a peculiarly
negative form of government, but I don’t see immediately any respect in
which people are being classified, or voters are being classified.</p>
<p class="P1">Equally—I don’t want to divert too far, but I do hope to
deal with the question sometime—I suppose abolishing the legislature
doesn’t violate the equal protection clause. The question is: If you
have a legislature and give people the right to use it, just as if you
have a court system and give people access to the courts, then what
does equal protection require?</p>
<p class="P1">Well, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I suggest the answer is a
question of degree. Let me make just one further answer to this: Like
all questions of degree, it’s hard to get a fixed rule; but I think
sometimes we can clarify our thinking by articulating the
generalization, loose as it may be, in different ways. And it occurred
to me that the proposition I have formulated might be put in somewhat
different language this way:</p>
<p class="P1">Looking at the balance that the State has struck between
these other purposes—like not–too–large districts, recognition of the
county or town, as an entity, is what it has—looking at it, does one
get the conviction that what it has done is strike a balance between
the notion of per capita equality and majority rule, and these other
competing considerations that require some modification? Or is what it
has done to weight some areas or some classes—people who live in some
areas, or some categories of people—as more important in the political
world than others?</p>
<p class="P1">When you look at it, which conviction are you left with?
If you’re left with the conviction that this involves creating
preferred political classes, and subordinate political classes, then it
violates the equal protection clause. If you’re left with the
conviction that the legislature focused on what I would define as its
job, and struck <b>[*53]</b> this balance, while we might not agree,
still it seems to have done it conscientiously, then I think it might
satisfy my test—that’s, again, not precise.</p>
<p class="P1">Let me come to this particular case, because the
67–senator amendment is, I think, most egregious in this respect—and
Maryland is most egregious in this respect. And these are really the
only two instances—indeed, I don’t think you have to face it in
Maryland—in which this question of degree does have to be faced, so
that I don’t have to fix, and the Court doesn’t have to fix, the line.
I think it would be wise not to fix the line, at least until there’s
some pretty clear view as to where it would be.</p>
<p>THE COURT: In New York, you told us—</p>
<p>MR. COX: In New York, I don’t have to reach this proposition. In New
York, the rule that New York apportions its senate on has no relation
to any permissible legislative purpose.</p>
<p class="P1">Let me put an illustration like this, Mr. Justice
Stewart, which is not any of these cases, though it’s close to the
Virginia case. Suppose that, in New York, the people of Erie
County—which is Buffalo, one of the big counties—were given only one
representative and only one senator, and the rest of the State was
apportioned according to population. I take it that the State would
look pretty good, in terms of the smallest minority that could control
the legislature in either house in terms of majority rule, but there
would be a clear and irrational—indeed, an invidious—discrimination
against that county; and the matter of majority rule wouldn’t have to
be looked at at all.</p>
<p class="P1">So, in the New York case, if you examine it closely—we
suggest this in our brief; we didn’t do as good a job as we might
have—but, if you examine it closely, you will see that the
discrimination between the counties over 6 percent, or
“three–fiftieths,” as the Deputy Attorney General insisted we must say
instead of 6 percent, does not tend to accomplish any of the purposes
of keeping counties small. The counties have been getting bigger. The
people who have been benefiting—excuse me, the districts have been
getting bigger. The counties haven’t been changing—the senate
districts. The people who have been benefiting are the people in
multi–districts, multi–senatorial district counties with less than
three–fiftieths; so that we say it falls under my second one. It has no
rational tendency to accomplish any permissible purpose. You don’t have
to consider the third one.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Mr. Solicitor, may I get back a moment to the 67–senator amendment?</p>
<p>MR. COX: Yes.</p>
<b>[*54]</b>
<p>THE COURT: I gather, if I understand your brief correctly, your
difficulty is that there is not only one senator for each of the 67
counties, but also at least one representative for each of the 67
counties, leaving in the lower house only some 39 seats to be
apportioned on population.</p>
<p>MR. COX: Yes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Are you suggesting that—let me put the question this way:
If the entire lower house was apportioned in terms of population, would
you have any difficulty?</p>
<p>MR. COX: Yes. Oh, well, excuse me. I spoke too quickly. I lay that
question to one side, and I say it would be a much harder question than
the Court has to decide now.</p>
<p>THE COURT: But it might still give you trouble?</p>
<p>MR. COX: I think if the majority—if the inequalities in the senate
are very, very great and the majority—and the proportion of people who
can elect a majority in the senate is very, very small, then the fact
that the other house is apportioned according to population, I would
say, should not be enough to save it. I’m under no necessity of arguing
that, though.</p>
<p>THE COURT: There would have to be some kind of population basis?</p>
<p>MR. COX: Yes. To illustrate the principle and not to lay any
emphasis on the figure, I should think one might well say that, if you
have population in the lower house, and in the upper house it would
take 33 percent of the people to elect a majority of the senators, and
there wasn’t too gross an inequality between the counties, that that
would do. But, if it got way down below 20 percent as it does in
Alabama, that that wouldn’t do. In other words, I think it’s not just
answerable in terms of the two houses. Also, I point out here that you
don’t have to go that far.</p>
<p>THE COURT: I would suppose, then, it might also follow that if, in
the upper house, it took, say, 55 percent to elect the majority of the
senators—</p>
<p>MR. COX: 50.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Let’s assume it’s better than 50.</p>
<p>MR. COX: I don’t think it’s true.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well, all right; 50, whatever it is. It’s got to be a very high figure, anyway.</p>
<b>[*55]</b>
<p>MR. COX: Yes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: And you might still say that the requirement of a single
senator, of one assemblyman in the lower house, might still be—</p>
<p>MR. COX: Oh, no. I think it would be a very freak situation. If you
have one assemblyman in the lower house, plus a remainder distributed
according to population, the percentages will not drop very, very low.
They’ll drop down to around 25—</p>
<p>THE COURT: Suppose we assume an upper house with 50 percent can
elect a majority. But you had a lower house, out of 105 as here, with
only 39–odd, if my arithmetic is any good, apportioned to population;
but you had an upper house, say, of 150. So that you had 75 or 80,
according to population, even though there was one assured to each
county in the lower house.</p>
<p>MR. COX: Then I think you come out with very nearly substantial per
capita equality in both houses. But I think my answer is that if one is
substantial equality, then the other can drop fairly low. If they both
start dropping below substantial equality, they’ve got to—</p>
<p class="P1">I do want to emphasize again—I guess I’ve said it too much— that, here, neither house is anywhere near equality.</p>
<p>THE COURT: But, if one house is on population and the other one
drops below, as you put it, you would require that the reasons for its
dropping below be something other, I suppose, than simply preferring
urban against rural, or rural against urban?</p>
<p>MR. COX: Oh, I think those are absolutely irrelevant; that they may not enter into the scales at all.</p>
<p class="P1">There may be these things I tried to state yesterday as
“permissible purposes,” but urban against rural, or management against
labor, or anything that involves what I think can fairly be called
“class distinctions” in the political world, are out. That seems to me
to be the essence of what equal protection means; that you can’t set up
political classes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: So that if the State comes to us here and says: We would
like to have one house vary from population; the reason is to keep nine
cities from having control—you would say that was unacceptable?</p>
<p>MR. COX: I would say that that was not acceptable, yes. Because Your
Honor put the point very well yesterday when you talked about keeping
nine cities who are the majority from having control. You are
necessarily saying, we’re going to turn control over to a <b>[*56]</b>
minority. And I—whether the majority may be trusted or not—I see no
greater reason to trust the minority. And the hypothesis of our
Constitution is that one is neither better nor worse than the other.</p>
<p class="P1">So that would be my answer to that line of argument.</p>
<p>THE COURT: [Inaudible]</p>
<p>MR. COX: Well, I would say—no, I don’t think so. I think that some
of these things are very real. My political experience is limited to
having been a town official, where the “town” is the unit, in
Massachusetts. And I think it was very real that the people in the
legislature, the General Court, looked to the people who were the town
officials to know pretty well what was going on in that town, what its
people thought, what its needs were. And I think this is something
which can be, I assume, can be taken into effect. I think it’s a real
argument. It’s a different kind of argument, at least, than the
arguments that are made about rural against urban.</p>
<p class="P1">Now to this extent, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I of course
would have to agree with you: I assume that, as happens in a great many
instances in legislation—we both know in the labor field—that one
reason will be given, and another reason is in people’s minds. But as
long as the Court—and this allows some play in the joints; I think it
is a good thing—as long as the good reason is available to justify it,
I don’t see how the Court can go behind it and say that they’ve taken
these other things into account.</p>
<p class="P1">That’s why, a moment ago, in trying to rearticulate my
test in a way I spoke not of the purpose of the legislation, but of
what the legislation, what its function was, what—looked at
objectively—it seemed to do. Did it create “preferred classes,” or was
it something that, looking at it, could honestly be judged the other
way?</p>
<p class="P1">May I say just one sentence, Mr. Chief Justice? With
respect to the decree below, it seems to us that the court, the
District Court, for reasons that it very well articulated, made a wise
exercise of its discretion here. It concluded that the decree would
enable the legislature to reapportion itself. It retained jurisdiction
to act, if it had to. And, bearing in mind the delicate interplay
between the State and the Federal courts, between the political
function and the judicial function, it seems to us that that was
clearly not an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Mr. Pitts?</p>
<center>REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF W. McLEAN PITTS, ESQ.,<br>ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT REYNOLDS IN NO. 23</center>
<p>MR. PITTS: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</p>
<b>[*57]</b>
<p class="P1">I have listened with interest to the argument of opposing
counsel, and I must turn to this proposition. I would like to call the
Court’s attention—this is in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice
Harlan, which I view the same way and which he asked me before:</p>
<blockquote class="p1">I can find nothing in the equal protection
clause or elsewhere in the Federal Constitution which expressly or
impliedly supports the view that state legislatures must be constructed
as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter. Not
only is that proposition refused by history, but it strikes deep to the
heart of our Federal system. Its acceptance would require us to turn
our backs on the regard which this Court has always shown for the
judgment of state legislatures and courts on matters basically of local
concern.</blockquote>
<p class="P1">Now that was Justice Harlan’s, taken from Justice Harlan’s dissenting opinion in <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr,</i>
which is our position in this case here. He asked me, in my opening
argument, whether or not I subscribed to it, whether I found
anything—the way he put it was that, necessarily, I must believe—</p>
<p>THE COURT: It might be better if you found something in the case which comes from the majority.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p class="P1">[General laughter.]</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: I agree with you, Mr. Justice. But I want to get back to this proposition. I wish that was in the majority opinion.</p>
<p class="P1">If we, as I see this case here, if it’s got to be
invidious discrimination before it can violate the Fourteenth
Amendment, the equal protection clause. Now if it’s merely because of
proportions, population, then we must look to the United States Senate.
If we look to the United States Senate, you can see where, according to
the 1960 Census, here are the following figures: 31 million people in
the 26 most–populous states, representing 17 percent of the population
of the United States, had 52 percent of the representation in the
United States Senate. Now is the Fourteenth Amendment going to afford
more protection to the voters than it would—to state voters—than it
would to Federal voters? Now that’s the proposition that seems to me
that this Court faces.</p>
<p class="P1">The other proposition is: In history—I believe I’m
correct in stating this—that under our system of Electoral College, I
believe <b>[*58]</b> that there has been a person elected that didn’t
receive the popular vote, majority of the popular vote, but received a
majority in the Electoral College.</p>
<p class="P1">Now if our system in Alabama is so discriminatory that it
violates the equal protection clause, then why don’t those two
provisions there provide us some protection under the Constitution? Why
don’t we get some protection from these other states in the Federal
elections, in the Senate?</p>
<p class="P1">Now we contend that the Alabama Constitution was a
rational plan. By putting certain checks in there about not having over
105, it kept the house to the lowest—35 senators—and then you had to
form your senatorial districts. We contend that that was not any
discrimination there in the constitution itself. But it was because the
legislature had failed to act, over a period of 60 years, and when they
did submit the 67–senator amendment bill, or tried to submit it to the
people, before the people ever had a chance to vote on it it was struck
down by our Federal court.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Is the Crawford–Webb Act now—it’s in effect, isn’t it?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: The Webb–Crawford Bill?</p>
<p>THE COURT: Yes.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well, it’s not in effect because the Federal District Court has knocked it out.</p>
<p>THE COURT: I know, but there was nothing—there was nothing left to happen for it to come into effect?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: No, sir. It came in effect in 1966.</p>
<p>THE COURT: If the court hadn’t acted, it would have—</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, sir. If the court hadn’t acted, the Webb–Crawford Bill would have gone into law in 1966.</p>
<p>THE COURT: But the only apportionment system that is given effect,
that would be in effect if the court’s order did not stand, is the old
one?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Would be the old system, yes, sir. But—</p>
<p>THE COURT: Without either the constitutional amendment, or the Webb–Crawford Act?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: You mean if this Court should reverse the decision? I would say that the 67—</p>
<p>THE COURT: If there was just an out–and–out reversal, the only apportionment system that would be in effect—</p>
<b>[*59]</b>
<p>MR. PITTS: —would be the 67–senator amendment bill and the Webb–Crawford Act.</p>
<p>THE COURT: That never passed. That never passed.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Sir?</p>
<p>THE COURT: The people have never voted on this.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, sir, but it would then be submitted to the people by special election.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Well, I know, but as of now, as of now there wouldn’t be—</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: As of now, yes, sir. But the Webb–Crawford Bill would be back on the books then.</p>
<p>THE COURT: I understand, but not until ’66.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: That’s right. And the 67–senator amendment bill could be submitted to the people as a constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>THE COURT: If—actually, the legislature that’s been elected, the
current legislature, wasn’t elected on the old apportionment, was it?</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: No, sir. The current legislature was elected under the court—</p>
<p>THE COURT: Interim order.</p>
<p>MR. PITTS: Yes, sir. In the court’s decree, the two bills, put
together—the 67–senator bill and the Webb–Crawford Bill—taking the
provisions of the house from the 67–senator and the provisions of the
senate from the Webb–Crawford, the two put together; that is what the
Federal Court decreed.</p>
<p class="P1">We submit to the Court that the people of Alabama should
have a right to vote on their own constitutional amendments, which
their legislature has passed. They should be given the right, and have
the opportunity, of voting to see whether or not they would reapportion
the Legislature of Alabama.</p>
<p class="P1">Now, even though that may not meet the requirements of
what the attorneys for the appellees desire, still it would be a
reapportionment. And I do not believe, under <i>Baker</i> versus <i>Carr</i>
that it would be any invidious discrimination there, that there is a
rational plan. And, for that reason, we say that then we’d have a
reapportioned legislature that would meet the requirements of the test
that has been laid down by this Court.</p>
<p class="P1">As to what this Court could do, it could be reversed—the matter could—several things. It could be reversed, and the legisla–<b>[*60]</b>ture
could be forced to submit, or to require all of the members to run on a
State, at–large basis. I don’t think the Legislature of Alabama, as
evidenced by the Attorney General’s statement and the other attorneys
for the appellees, that the Legislature of Alabama would ever allow
that to happen. I think that they would pass some type of
reapportionment bill that would reapportion the State of Alabama. But,
to place what these gentlemen want, the attorneys for the appellees, on
the basis that they want reapportionment, is strictly having both
houses on a population basis, then we are going to have a big majority
of the State of Alabama that is not going to have any representation,
but is going to be under the thumb of the dense areas where population
has grown because of the industrial areas. And we submit that it’s just
as bad to have people living under those conditions as it is to be
having a minority ruling a majority. We believe that the Constitution
of Alabama has set a system of checks and balances, and has stated how
it should be; and that the constitution, in providing for
representation in the houses of the legislature, is reasonable,
rational, and can be followed.</p>
<p class="P1">We respectfully submit to this Court that this case should be reversed and the opinion of the District Court reversed.</p>
