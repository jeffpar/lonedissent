  <h2>The Supreme Court Library</h2>
  <div class="entry">
    <p>In 2005, on my first (and last) visit to the U.S. Supreme Court Library, with librarian Brian
Stiglmeier’s help, I was able to browse their small collection of early transcripts and duplicate
a few of them.  I recently posted them here under <a href="/transcripts/pre-1968">Pre-1968 Transcripts</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, shortly after my visit in 2005, the Supreme Court Library closed for remodeling, and
when it reopened, it was <em>no longer open to the public</em>.  If you take a tour of the Supreme Court,
they will permit you to peer into the library through a pane of glass, but even on a guided tour,
the public isn’t permitted in the library.  It has become an enclave for the exclusive use of
employees, members of the Supreme Court Bar, and other “privileged” guests – not exactly the sort
of openness one might hope for from our own Federal government.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/scotus/Supreme-Court-Library.jpg" alt="Supreme Court Library" /></p>

<p>In recent years, the Supreme Court Library has
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/archived_transcripts/1968">posted</a> all its transcripts
from the 1968 Term onward, as well as historical copies of the
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/scannedjournals.aspx">Journal of the Supreme Court of the United States</a>.
They haven’t yet added any of the <a href="/transcripts/pre-1968">pre-1968 transcripts</a> in their possession,
but this is a welcome trend.</p>

<p>However, I suspect these digitization efforts are primarily an attempt to deflect any criticism
of the Library’s “closed door” policy, because the more materials they can claim are available
either on their website or at other public institutions, the more they probably think their
restrictive policy is somehow defensible.  In my humble opinion, it is not.</p>

<hr />

<p>NOTE: According to the Supreme Court Historical Society website, “By special written arrangement
with the Librarian of the Court, access to the Library is also available to visiting scholars in need
of materials uniquely available in the Library’s collection.”</p>

<p>In other words, if you jump through a series of undefined hoops <em>and</em> can demonstrate that whatever
you’re looking for is <em>not</em> available anywhere else, then maybe, just maybe, you’ll be allowed to visit
the library – or at least be permitted to wait at the door while someone else looks for you.</p>
