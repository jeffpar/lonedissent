     * Produces a UTC date when ONLY a date (no time) is provided; otherwise, it combines the date and
     * and time, producing a date that is either UTC or local, depending on the presence (or lack) of time
     * zone information.  Finally, if numeric inputs are provided, then Date.UTC() is called to generate
     * a UTC time.
     *
     * In general, you should use this instead of new Date(s), because the Date constructor implicitly calls
     * Date.parse(s), which behaves inconsistently.  For example, ISO date-only strings (e.g. "1970-01-01")
     * generate a UTC time, but non-ISO date-only strings (eg, "10/1/1945" or "October 1, 1945") generate a
     * local time.

     * notice the discrepancy in the time-of-day.  Even if there is some technical reason (eg, a DayLight
