The Supreme Court began recording oral arguments in October 1955 on reel-to-reel tapes that it would
later send to the National Archives.  Normally, such tapes are considered "masters" which are stored
in special climate-controlled rooms and which most people are not permitted to touch.

If someone wanted a copy of anything on those tapes, they would have to fill out a form and wait for
the archives to produce a reference or "shelf" copy.  In the old days, those reference copies would be
5-inch reel-to-reel tapes.  As technology progressed, cassette tapes were used to create reference copies,
and most recently, audio CDs.

However, if you were lucky and someone else had already requested a tape you were interested in,
then a reference copy might already be sitting on the shelf.  For example, in March 2014, I requested a reference copy of [Keeton v. Hustler Magazine](https://www.supremecourt.gov/pdfs/transcripts/1983/82-485_11-08-1983.pdf), so when I visited the National Archives in College Park, Maryland in April 2014, I was able to locate the CD in their compact stacks and copy the audio onto my laptop.  So now anyone else who wants that particular audio recording can do the same.

In fact, most Supreme Court recordings from 1955 into the 1970s are currently available on 5-inch
reel-to-reel reference tapes at College Park, sitting on shelves in compact stacks for anyone to access --
but not because someone had previously requested them all.  At some point, probably in the 1970s, NARA undertook
a massive effort to duplicate all the original tapes, producing new masters, and then cutting and relabeling
the original tapes to produce what are now called reference or shelf copies.

So, when you pick up a Supreme Court audio tape from the 1950s or 1960s off the shelves at NARA, you are holding
the *original* tape, not a copy.

## About That Keeton v. Hustler Recording

When a reference copy of an audio recording doesn't exist (which was true of the Keeton recording prior to 2014),
you must submit a request identifying the recording you're interested in.  The Keeton recording was listed in
Record Group 267, Item Number 267.458, Docket Number 82-485.

As you can see below, once the reference copy is generated, it's shelved chronologically with the rest of
the randomly requested reference copies.

When you finally get the recording, you'll often find other material both before and after the
actual oral argument.  For example, in Keeton, you can hear the Marshal's traditional "Oyez Oyez Oyez" opening, followed by a handful of admissions to the Supreme Court Bar.

Note: the rest of the [Keeton](https://apps.oyez.org/player/#/burger8/oral_argument_audio/19772) argument can be found on the [Oyez website](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/82-485).

What's also interesting about the Keeton case is that, reportedly, Larry Flynt made an obscene outburst at the conclusion of the argument.  Whatever transpired, however, didn't get picked up by the Court's microphones.

The incident may have piqued the interest of Justice White a few years later, because I also
found the following correspondence in the archives, stashed among all the Day Call sheets.
