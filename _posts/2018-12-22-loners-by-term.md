title: "Loners by Term"

We just ran our new `gulp loners` task:

    gulp loners --term=2003

and we now have our first [Loners](/cases/loners/) entry: the [2003 Term](/cases/loners/2003-10).

It's very minimalistic at the moment, but more meat will be added to the bones soon.

## January 4, 2019 Update

All terms have now been processed:

    gulp loners --term=1790-02 --end=2017-10

and the [Loners](/cases/loners/) page has been updated to display all U.S. Supreme Court terms in which
there was one or more Lone Dissent.
