When the `gulp loners` task is run for all available terms:

    gulp loners --term=1790-02 --end=2017-10

it also produces an index of all [Justices with Lone Dissents](/justices/loners).  The index is sorted
by the number of lone dissents per Justice, from largest to smallest.

Phase One of the Lone Dissent Project is now complete.
