title: "The Supreme Court Library"

In March 2005, on my first (and last) visit to the U.S. Supreme Court Library, with librarian Brian
Stiglmeier's help, I was able to browse their small collection of early transcripts and duplicate
a few of them.  All the copies I made are available under [Transcripts](/transcripts/).

In addition, the Library gave me a document titled
"[Oral Arguments Available in the U.S. Supreme Court Library Prior to the 1968 Term](/sources/scotus/transcripts/SCOTUS_Library_Oral_Arguments_Prior_To_1968.pdf)" (the handwritten notations are mine).
A list of the cases in that 2005 document have been reproduced [below](#oral-arguments-available-in-the-us-supreme-court-library-prior-to-the-1968-term).

Sadly, shortly after my visit in 2005, the Supreme Court Library closed for remodeling, and
when it reopened, it was *no longer open to the public*.  If you take a tour of the Supreme Court,
they will permit you to peer into the library through a pane of glass, but even on a guided tour,
the public isn't permitted in the library.  It has become an enclave for the exclusive use of
employees, members of the Supreme Court Bar, and other "privileged" guests -- not exactly the sort
of openness one might hope for from our own Federal government.

In recent years, the Supreme Court Library has
[posted](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/archived_transcripts/1968) all its transcripts
from the 1968 Term onward, as well as historical copies of the
[Journal of the Supreme Court of the United States](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/scannedjournals.aspx).
They haven't yet added any of the [pre-1968 transcripts](/transcripts/pre-1968/) in their possession,
but this is a welcome trend.

However, I suspect these digitization efforts are primarily an attempt to deflect any criticism
of the Library's "closed door" policy, because the more materials they can claim are available
either on their website or at other public institutions, the more they probably think their
restrictive policy is somehow defensible.  In my humble opinion, it is not.

---

NOTE: According to the Supreme Court Historical Society website, "By special written arrangement
with the Librarian of the Court, access to the Library is also available to visiting scholars in need
of materials uniquely available in the Library's collection."

In other words, if you jump through a series of undefined hoops *and* can demonstrate that whatever
you're looking for is *not* available anywhere else, then maybe, just maybe, you'll be allowed to visit
the library -- or at least be permitted to wait at the door while someone else looks for you.

## Oral Arguments Available in the U.S. Supreme Court Library Prior to the 1968 Term

A few notes about the following list, from observations I made at the time:

- Just because a case is on the list doesn't mean the Library still has it.  For example, I asked for a 1903 case -- *Northern Securities v. United States*, 193 U.S. 197 (Case No. 277) -- and all Brian could tell me was that it wasn't there.
- Some of their transcripts, such as *Youngstown v. Sawyer*, are nothing more than copies from "Landmark Briefs and Arguments".  Since that argument predates the Court's audio recording system, a formal transcript by a court reporter must have been produced, but apparently the Library no longer has it.
- Other transcripts are 2nd or 3rd generation copies; for example, Brian showed me their *Brown v. Board of Education* transcripts: poor quality light-purple copies made from long-lost originals.
- A small number of transcripts going back as far as 1844 are available, but they are in a special collection -- "The Elbridge Thomas Gerry Collection" -- which I was not allowed to see on short notice.

Note that not every case in the list represents a distinct transcript, because some were
consolidated for oral argument.  Moreover, not every transcript in the list is a unique holding
of the Supreme Court Library; most of them are also available on microfiche (eg, the University
Publications of America microfiche collection), while others are available in the
"[Landmark Briefs and Arguments](/sources/lba/lists/Landmark_Briefs_and_Arguments-Index.pdf)"
collection (eg, *Adamson v. California*, *Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority*, etc).
I've made an effort to **highlight** any cases below that fall outside those collections and
therefore *may* be a unique holding.

It's also possible that many of the following transcripts are unique insofar as they differ
from what's available on microfiche, because many of the UPA transcripts were recreated after
the fact, by transcribing [Supreme Court audio tapes](/blog/2019/03/01/) deposited at the National
Archives, whereas transcripts in the Supreme Court Library's possession are often copies produced
by a court reporter.
