I just added a collection of [Pre-1955 Transcripts](/transcripts/pre-1955) to the website,
which I hope to grow over time.

I obtained most of those transcripts back in 2005, on my first (and last) visit to the U.S. Supreme Court Library.  With librarian Brian Stiglmeier's help, I was able to browse their small collection of pre-1955 (aka "pre-Warren") transcripts, and using an on-site copier, I duplicated a tiny handful of them.

Sadly, shortly after my visit in 2005, the Supreme Court Library closed for remodeling, and when it reopened, it was *no longer open to the public*.  If you take a tour of the Supreme Court,
they will permit you to peer into the library through a pane of glass, but even on a guided tour,
the public isn't permitted in the library.  It has become an enclave for the exclusive use of
members of the Supreme Court Bar and other "privileged" guests -- not exactly the sort of openness you would expect from one of our most important "public" branches of government.

Coincidentally, the Supreme Court Library recently [posted](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/archived_transcripts/1968) all its transcripts from 1968 onward.  They haven't
gotten to any older transcripts yet -- including any of those we've [posted](/transcripts/pre-1955) -- but hopefully they will someday.

I suspect the Supreme Court Library's recent digitization efforts are an attempt to deflect any criticism of its "closed door" policy, because the more materials they can claim are available either on their website or at other public institutions, the more they probably think their restrictive policy is somehow defensible.  In my humble opinion, it is not.

NOTE: According to the Supreme Court Historical Society website, "By special written arrangement with the Librarian of the Court, access to the Library is also available to visiting scholars in need of materials uniquely available in the Library's collection."

In other words, if you jump through a series of undefined hoops *and* can demonstrate that whatever you're looking for is *not* available anywhere else, then maybe, just maybe, you'll be allowed to visit the library -- or at least be permitted to wait at the door while someone else looks for you.
