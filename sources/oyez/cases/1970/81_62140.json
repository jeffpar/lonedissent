  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>These are two consolidated cases. In 81, Clarence Williams was arrested in his house in 1967. Police searched the house for an hour and 45 minutes, discovering heroin on a shelf in a bedroom. The heroin was admitted at trial and Williams was convicted of concealing illegally imported heroin. Williams appealed, arguing that the search of his house was illegal under Chimel v. California, a case decided on June 23, 1969 that narrowed the permissible scope of searches incidental to an arrest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that Chimel did not apply retroactively, and the search was valid under pre-Chimel standards.</p>\n<p>In 82, Joseph Elkanich was convicted on three counts of selling narcotics in 1962. At trial, evidence included marked bills planted by a federal narcotics agent. The bills were seized during a search of Elkanich’s apartment after his arrest. The arrest and search were upheld at trial and on appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari. Elkanich then unsuccessfully applied for post-conviction relief in the district court. While the appeal of that decision was pending, &lt;i&gt;Chimel&lt;/i&gt; was decided. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Does Chimel v. California apply retroactively to arrests and searches that occurred before June 23, 1969?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>No. Though not agreeing on an opinion, six members of the Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit in both cases. Justice Byron R. White delivered the judgment of the Court, holding that Chimel did not apply retroactively whether a conviction is challenged on direct review, as in 81, or in collateral proceedings, as in 82. Justice Potter Stewart concurred, writing that he would affirm 82 because the question presented was not permitted in post-conviction relief proceedings. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. concurred in the result, agreeing that Chimel did not apply to searches conducted before June 23, 1969 following the three-factor analysis from Stoval v. Denno. Justice Hugo L. Black, concurred in the result, stating that Chimel was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p>Justice John. M. Harlan concurred in part and dissented in part, writing that he would affirm the conviction on 82, but would reverse on 81 because Chimel could apply retroactively to a direct review. Justice Thurgood Marshall also concurred in part and dissented in part. Justice William O. Douglas did not participate.</p>\n",
