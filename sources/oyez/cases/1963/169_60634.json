  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 1956, the Attorney General of Alabama, John M. Patterson, filed suit against the NAACP, a New York corporation advocating for equal rights for black Americans. He filed the action as an attempt to oust the association from the state. The claim alleged that the NAACP failed to comply with Alabama statutes requiring foreign corporations to register with the Alabama Secretary of State, along with other acts more clearly related to the NAACP’s political mission. That same day, the Attorney General obtained a restraining order barring the NAACP from conducting business in the state or attempting to comply with the statutory requirements in question. Before the case was heard on the merits, the court found the NAACP to be in contempt, in part for failing to comply with a court order requiring the NAACP to produce records.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Alabama dismissed the NAACP’s petition for a writ of certiorari. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States held that requiring the NAACP to produce records including names and addresses of its members was a violation of those members’ freedom of association. The Supreme Court of Alabama, however, again affirmed the judgment of contempt, arguing that the Supreme Court’s judgment rested on the mistaken premise that Alabama had incorrectly interpreted its own procedural rules. The Supreme Court of the United States again remanded the case in a per curiam opinion, holding that the NAACP had satisfied the district court’s order even though the NAACP did not produce the membership lists.</p>\n<p>The NAACP then filed an action in federal court, alleging that the Alabama courts were depriving the organization of its constitutional rights and seeking to enjoin enforcement of the trial court’s restraining order. The district court dismissed the action, but the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded to the district court, instructing the district court to retain jurisdiction only if Alabama state courts did not promptly try the NAACP’s case. The Supreme Court of the United States then ordered the district court to try the NAACP’s case unless the State of Alabama gave the NAACP a hearing before January 2, 1962. In December 1961, an Alabama circuit court decreed that the NAACP continued its activities in Alabama in violation of the laws and constitution of Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed.</p>\n",
  "question": "<ol><li>Was the NAACP properly barred from obtaining a hearing in Alabama courts because its brief did not conform to the rules of the Supreme Court of Alabama?</li>\n<li>Was this a state question barring federal review?</li>\n<li>Did Alabama properly enjoin the NAACP from acting in Alabama because the NAACP failed to comply with statutory requirements for foreign corporations?</li>\n<li>Did Alabama properly enjoin the NAACP from acting in Alabama because its political activities violated Alabama law?</li>\n</ol>",
  "conclusion": "<p>In a unanimous opinion written by Justice John Harlan, the Court held that the form of the NAACP’s brief should not prevent it from obtaining a hearing in Alabama courts. Justice Harlan first determined whether the form of the NAACP's brief was a state question barring federal review. He noted that the Court had already ruled that most of the formal requirements deprived the NAACP of its federal constitutional rights. Justice Harlan cited the Court’s prior reasoning on the NAACP’s claim, confirming that novelty in state procedural requirements cannot prevent parties from seeking to vindicate their federal constitutional rights in state courts.</p>\n<p>Justice Harlan also held that Alabama improperly applied the state registration requirements. He looked to the language of the statute, noting that the stated penalty for failure to comply was a forfeiture of one thousand dollars for each offense; there was no mention of permanent ouster in the statutory language. Justice Harlan determined that the purpose of the requirements was simply to ensure that foreign corporations would be amenable to suit in Alabama, and confirmed this interpretation through a brief overview of Alabama case law.</p>\n<p>Turning to Alabama’s other allegations, Justice Harlan held that the vast majority of the NAACP’s actions did not violate any particular Alabama law, and all of its actions were constitutionally protected or controllable by other, more appropriate public remedies. Justice Harlan rejected Alabama’s contentions that the NAACP illegally 1) paid for two black students to attend the University of Alabama, 2) failed to disclose membership information, 3) made false allegations against state officials, 4) violated Alabama’s injunction, and 5) breached the peace, along with several other allegations. He argued that these activities were more related to the NAACP’s members’ freedom to associate for the collective advocacy of their ideas than to the NAACP’s privilege to do business in Alabama.</p>\n",
