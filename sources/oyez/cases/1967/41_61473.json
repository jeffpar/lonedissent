  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Sam Umans was a certified public accountant. Between 1959 and 1961, the Internal Revenue Service audited six couples represented by Umans. According to Louis R. Deitsch, an IRS employee, Umans approached Deitsch before each audit to “work something out together on it”. They agreed upon a disallowance for each audit and Umans gave Deitsch an envelope containing $50 for each case. Five other IRS employees described similar transactions between the years 1961 and 1963, wherein smaller disallowances were given during audits followed by cash payments to the auditing IRS employees.</p>\n<p>Umans and the six IRS employees, including Deitsch, were indicted in August 1964. Umans was charged with aiding and abetting IRS employees in receiving illegal fees.  He was also charged with giving money to government officials. On March 25, 1965, Umans and the six IRS employees were re-indicted.  The grand jury additionally charged Umans with giving money to government officials with the intent to influence their actions. The evidence before the grand jury consisted solely of an IRS agent summarizing statements made by witnesses who would later testify at Umans’ trial. At trial, Umans requested access to statements made by the IRS employees that they took bribes from persons other than Umans; the court denied this request and sealed the documents in question. The government’s case was based almost entirely on the testimonies of three of the IRS employees, including that of Deitsch.</p>\n<p>Judge Sterry R. Waterman, writing for a unanimous United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, held that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the intent element of Umans’ charge for aiding and abetting IRS employees, but that this instruction was not in plain error. He held that the instruction was not sufficiently prejudicial, noting that it was not objected to at trial. Judge Waterman did, however, reverse the sentence for giving money to officials, holding that this sentence could not be concurrent with the sentence for giving money to officials with intent to influence their actions. He noted that the charges were identical but for the higher requirement of proof in the latter charge. Looking to the statute itself, Judge Waterman determined that Congress intended to make the charge for giving money to officials a lesser, included offense.</p>\n<p>Judge Waterman held that the trial court properly excluded the IRS employees’ statements about taking bribes from other persons from the record. He reasoned that it would have been within the court’s discretion to prevent Umans from cross-examining the IRS employees on this subject for impeachment purposes, as the government did not broach the subject during the employees’ direct examination. Judge Waterman also held that the government properly indicted Umans with hearsay evidence, holding that this evidence was competent. He dismissed Umans’ concerns about inconsistencies between the evidence presented to the grand jury and evidence presented at trial. He noted that Umans had access to affadavits used by the government to indict him; thus, he could have objected to any inconsistencies at trial, but did not do so.</p>\n",
  "question": "<ol><li>Did the trial court’s instruction on aiding and abetting government workers in receiving illegal fees constitute a plain error?</li>\n<li>Was Umans’ conviction for illegally paying officials included in his conviction for unlawfully influencing officials?</li>\n<li>Was the trial court within its discretion to withhold statements from the IRS employees wherein they admitted receiving bribes from other persons?</li>\n<li>Was Umans improperly indicted on hearsay evidence?</li>\n</ol>",
  "conclusion": "<p>In a <i>per curiam</i> opinion, the Court dismissed the United States’ writ of certiorari as improvidently granted without further comment.</p>\n<p>Justice John Harlan would have granted certiorari to affirm the court of appeals' judgment for the reasons given by Judge Waterman in his opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice Thurgood Marshall took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>On December 18, 1967, the Court denied Umans petition for a rehearing, with Justice Marshall again taking no part in the consideration or decision of the petition.</p>\n",
