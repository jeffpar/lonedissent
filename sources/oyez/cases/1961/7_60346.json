  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>John Joseph Killian was an employee at the Allen-Bradley Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and a member of Local 1111, United Electrical Radio and Machine Workers of America. From October of 1952 to February 28, 1953, Killian served as an officer of Local 1111. On December 9, 1952, the president of Local 1111 ordered all officers to come to the union office to execute affidavits stating that they were not members of the Communist Party, in accordance with the Taft-Hartley Act.</p>\n<p>As early as the fall of 1949, Killian was a member of the Communist party group on the campus of the University of Wisconsin and in the city of Madison, Wisconsin. Killian held a number of the group’s meetings in his home. Government witness Sullivan transferred his Communist Party membership to Madison in October 1949; Killian contacted him in his role assigning individuals to Communist Party groups or cells. In November of 1951, Killian and others formed a Communist Party cell to operate within the Allen-Bradley plant. Killian suggested to a government witness and co-worker, Ondrejka, that both should become stewards of Local 1111 to advance party aims within the union; both subsequently became officers and participated in union meetings.</p>\n<p>Killian was charged with making false statements in an affidavit. At trial, both Sullivan and Onrejka testified that they joined the Communist Party at the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. On cross-examination, Sullivan and Ondrejka testified that the FBI paid them monthly amounts for their services, and were reimbursed for expenses incurred in Communist Party activities. Killian moved for production of all statements given by Sullivan and Ondrejka to the FBI, with a particular focus on reports made by Ondrejka of his reimbursable expenses and receipts signed by Ondrejka; Killian requested this evidence to impeach the witnesses’ testimony. Killian also moved to strike both Sullivan and Ondrejka’s testimony. The government instead offered to produce a list showing the dates and amounts of payments to Ondrejka and whether each payment was for services or expenses. Killian refused this substituted evidence, and the district court denied Killian’s motions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld Killian's conviction, holding that the district judge properly excluded the requested reports and receipts because they were not related to the direct testimony of the witnesses.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>(1) Was the prosecution properly excused from producing statements and documents that reported payments to prosecution witnesses?</p>\n<p>(2) Did the jury instructions properly define membership in the Communist Party?</p>\n<p>(3) Did the jury instructions properly define “affiliation”?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>No, yes, and yes. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Charles E. Whittaker, the Court held that the district court must determine whether the documents requested by Killian were destroyed in good faith and in accord with normal practice, as suggested by the United States. If so, Killian would not be entitled to a new trial, because this would suggest that the information contained on the receipts was finally recorded elsewhere and already in evidence. The United States claimed that only two of Ondrejka’s receipts related to his testimony and that this information was contained in Ondrejka’s narrative statements; Justice Whittaker instructed the district court to make a final judgment for the government if it finds that this claim was true.</p>\n<p>Justice Whittaker rejected Killian’s objection to the jury instruction’s subjective definition of membership in the Communist Party. He reasoned that the very nature of claimed membership in a secret or underground organization precludes the existence of objective proof of membership. Justice Whittaker also rejected Killian’s argument that the Communist Control Act (CCA) -- from which the jury instructions were largely drawn -- was unconstitutional. He noted that Killian was charged with lying about being a Communist in an affidavit, not with being a member of the Communist Party, the status prohibited by the CCA.</p>\n<p>Justice Whittaker held that the district court properly defined “affiliation” for its jury instruction. He cited several decisions in the circuit courts using similar definitions of \"affiliation\" with the Communist Party. He rejected Killian’s narrow definition of “affiliation”, wherein the government would have to show that Killian was a member of an organization working with the Communist Party. He held that the district court’s definition was reasonable and properly outlined, vacating the judgment and remanding the case to the district court. </p>\n<p>Justice Hugo Black dissented. He argued that compelling union officers to swear they are not Communists violated the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of belief and political association. He noted that test oaths are historic weapons against religious and political minority.</p>\n<p>Justice William O. Douglas dissented, joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice Black. Justice Douglas argued that the jury could find Killian guilty only if he committed illegal acts in connection with his role in the Communist Party. As the record contained no evidence of Killian committing an illegal act, his conviction should have been reversed.</p>\n<p>Justice William J. Brennan dissented. He took issue with the majority’s interpretation of “membership”, and would have required evidence of some objective act of association and admission, understood as such by the party and by Killian.</p>\n<p>\"</p>\n",
