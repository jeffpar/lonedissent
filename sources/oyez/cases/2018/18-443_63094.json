  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>In 2016, the US Supreme Court heard arguments in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2016/15-797\"><em>Moore v. Texas</em>, 581 U.S. __ (2017)</a>, to resolve the question whether the use of outdated medical standards regarding intellectual disability to determine whether a person is exempt from execution violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, as well as the Court’s precedent in Atkins v. Virginia. A majority of the Court held that it does, vacated the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals below, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>On remand, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reconsidered the issue and reach the same conclusion. The Court again granted review.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Did the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals err in holding that defendant Bobby James Moore lacked intellectual disability and thus was eligible for the death penalty?</p>\n",
  "conclusion": "<p>In a per curiam opinion issued without argument, the Court reversed the lower court, finding that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals erroneously held that Bobby James Moore lacked intellectual disability and thus was eligible for the death penalty. In its original decision in 2017, the Court criticized the lower court for largely basing its analysis and reasoning on outdated medical standards. On remand, the Texas court again noted three criteria for evaluating mental disability—intellectual-functioning deficits, adaptive deficits, and early onset—but focused almost exclusively on the second criterion. The Court found this focus to be inconsistent with its prior opinion. The Court pointed out “too many instances in which, with small variations, [the court of appeals] repeats the analysis we previously found wanting, and these same parts are critical to its ultimate conclusion.” In determining that the trial court record shows that Moore is a person with intellectual disability, the Supreme Court noted that the appeals court’s opinion “rests upon analysis too much of which too closely resembles what we previously found improper.” </p>\n",
