  <justiceBiography>
    <p>
      <span>Tom C. Clark was born, raised, and educated in Texas. The son of a prominent politician, Clark was active in Texas Democratic politics. He joined the Justice Department in 1937 and served as civilian coordinator of the forced evacuation of Japanese-Americans from the West Coast during World War II. President Harry S Truman appointed Clark attorney general in 1945, and nominated him to the High Court in 1949. Truman later lamented his choice. "It's not that he's a bad man," rued Truman. "It's just that he's the dumbest sonofabitch I ever met." Clark resigned in 1967 to avoid any question of conflict of interest after President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Clark's son, Ramsey, to serve as Attorney General.</span>
