  <justiceBiography>
    <p>
      <span>Wiley Rutledge was President Franklin Delano Roovelt's eighth and last appointment to the Supreme Court. Rutledge had spoken out in support of Roosevelt's court-packing plan while dean of the University of Iowa Law School. Roosevelt appointed him to the federal appellate bench in 1939 where Rutledge demonstrated strong liberal credentials.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Rutledge proved to be a strong liberal on the High Court. He did not see the Fourteenth Amendment as a limitation on the reach of the Bill of Rights. Due process had meaning that might go beyond specific Bill of Rights provisions.</span>
