  <justiceBiography>
    <p>
      <span>Arthur Goldberg was a Chicagoan and a graduate of Northwestern Law School. He was an expert in labor law and built his practice around this specialty. He was instrumental in the merger of the two giant labor organizations of the day: The American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Goldberg's tenure on the Court was short-lived. President Johnson persuaded him to resign to become the American ambassador to the United Nations. He resigned his ambassadorship in 1968; practiced law briefly in New York, and then ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for governor in 1970. He returned to Washington where he continued to practice law until his death in 1990.</span>
