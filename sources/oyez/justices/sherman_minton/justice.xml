  <justiceBiography>
    <p>
      <span>Sherman Minton was elected to the United States Senate from Indiana in 1934. He was a strong advocate of Roosevelt's "Court-Packing" plan. After his losing reelection bid in 1940, Roosevelt appointed him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Minton was nominated to the Supreme Court by Harry Truman, a close personal friend. Ill health forced Minton's resignation in 1956. Minton disappointed most liberals by consistently preferring order to freedom. Minton voted to uphold statutes intended to protect the national security; he rejected challenges asserting violations of individual liberties. Upon his retirement, Minton observed: "There will be more interest in who will succeed me than in my passing. I'm an echo."</span>
