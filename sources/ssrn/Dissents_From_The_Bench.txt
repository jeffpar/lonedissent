Dissents from the Bench: A Compilation of Oral Dissents by U.S.
Supreme Court Justices*
Jill Duffy** & Elizabeth Lambert***
Oral dissents identify some of the Supreme Court justices’ most deeply held
minority opinions. While print dissents are published routinely, oral dissents
are not systematically tracked. This article presents the results of our AALL
grant-funded project to locate oral dissents issued from October 1969 through
today, discusses the methodology used in compiling our list, and describes
various aspects of oral dissents that may make some more difficult to find.
“I exercise the privilege we have – though rarely used – to dissent orally.
This is a uniquely important case …” Opening sentences of Justice Powell’s
oral dissent in Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979).1
In modern times, when the Supreme Court hands down a decision, the chief justice
announces that a result has been reached and the author of the majority speaks briefly
about the case.2 There is no advance notice to the public about the fact that an opinion will
be announced. An oral dissent, or “dissenting statement,” is a declaration that a justice
makes aloud in open Court, immediately following the majority’s announcement of the
Court’s opinion. Oral dissents are rare, occurring only a few times each year at most, and
they are an added gesture justices make when they wish to underscore that, in their view,
the majority opinion is flawed or fundamentally wrong.3
While the text of dissenting opinions are common and published routinely, the
dissenting statements justices make in open court have not been systematically tracked or

In the Supreme Court’s early years, justices only issued their opinions orally and individually, or “in seriatim,”
with the most junior justice speaking first. Written opinions were not issued. By Chief Justice John Marshall’s
tenure (1801-1835) that practice had ended and justices delivered opinions for the Court as a whole. Prior to 1940,
there was a norm by which justices did not issue dissents orally or in writing, but by the Warren Court (1953-1969),
oral dissents were relatively popular, examples of which include: Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community
School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969) (Black, J., dissenting orally); Stewart v. United States, 366 U.S. 1 (1961)
(Frankfurter, J., dissenting orally); and Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178 (1957) (Clark, J., dissenting orally),
all cited in New York Times news accounts. For a brief historical account of oral and written dissents see Jeff Bleich,

transcribed.4 Except for the occasional reading of an entire opinion, such as Justice
Stewart’s reading of his entire dissenting opinion in Fullilove v. Klutznick (1980), justices’
dissenting statements can be worded differently than their published dissenting opinions.5
Despite the potential value to Supreme Court researchers, few, if any, lists exist identifying
the cases in which oral dissents have occurred.6
Our goal is to present as complete a list as possible of Supreme Court cases, from
the Burger, Rehnquist, and Roberts Courts (October Term 1969–current) in which an oral
dissent was issued, along with citable support for each included case. Our list appears in the
accompanying Appendix. Care was taken to correctly identify cases receiving an oral dissent
and otherwise note those cases in which an oral concurring statement occurred. As detailed
in the methodology section, we used sources such as Supreme Court opinion announcement
audio via The Oyez Project (“Oyez”), secondary sources, and the justices’ papers to compile
our list. We also describe the Supreme Court opinion announcement audio existing at the
National Archives Records Administration (“NARA”). In the final section of the article, we
detail aspects of oral dissents that may make some oral dissents more difficult to find.
Inevitably cases will be added to this list as the Supreme Court moves forward with its
caseload and as additional research tools become available. We welcome such additions. We
view this work as a first step toward filling a bibliographic need in Supreme Court research
and seek to document these potentially lost occurrences in the most comprehensive manner
possible. In doing so, we hope to add to the historical record and to preserve the tradition of
oral dissents.7

The Journal of the Supreme Court of the United States [hereinafter Supreme Court Journal] notes oral dissents
sporadically in the 1990s and more comprehensively today. The Oyez Project at Oyez.org has made great strides in
increasing accessibility to the opinion announcement audio housed at the National Archives in College Park,
Maryland.

Listen, for example, to Justice Ginsburg’s oral dissent in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, which
starts “Justice Alito announced four members of this Court…,” and compare it with her written dissent which starts
“Lilly Ledbetter was a supervisor at Goodyear Tire and Rubber’s plant in Gadsden, Alabama…” Compare The Oyez
Project, Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, 550 U.S. 618 (2007), http://oyez.org/cases/20002009/2006/2006_05_1074 (Opinion Announcement, J. Ginsburg at 3:48) with Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber
Co., 550 U.S. 618, 643 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); see also Blackmun, in Unusual Action, Denounces 5-to-4
Ruling, N.Y. TIMES, Nov. 3, 1976, at 70 (“Justice Blackmun’s written dissent today, however, was not as critical as
his oral opinion. Presumably, this was because in his written dissent he spoke for three other Justices as well.”).

In early 2008, at the time of our grant application, we were aware of the need for a list of Supreme Court cases
receiving an oral dissent. While writing, that need was underscored as evidenced by the inclusion of our interim
work in Lani Guinier, Supreme Court 2007 Term Foreword: Demosprudence Through Dissent, 122 HARV. L. REV.
4, n. 44 et. seq. (2008). Today, multiple groups seek to create oral dissent datasets. See, e.g., Timothy R. Johnson,
Ryan C. Black & Eve M. Ringsmuth, Hear Me Roar: What Provokes Supreme Court Justices to Dissent from the
Bench (forthcoming in MINN. L. REV.) and William D. Blake & Hans J. Hacker, The Brooding Spirit of the Law:

Project History
We began this project in the height of oral dissent “season.”8 What would seem like
one in-depth research question (which Supreme Court cases since October Term 1969
received an oral dissent?) became a myriad of individual research questions: What is the
condition of the opinion announcement audio at NARA? Where are the personal papers of
the justices serving on the Court since October Term 1969? What are the restrictions? What
efforts to digitize opinion announcement audio exist? How do reporters reference “oral
dissents” in the news?
We worked together, across several states, to answer these questions and compile our
results. By design this project had technological and geographic challenges, but unbeknown
to us, we were approaching a wave of both interest in this topic and increased resources
available for its completion. The next section describes the resources we used to compile
our list, details the opinion announcement audio collection at NARA, and describes some of
the difficulties in compiling such a list, using Roe v. Wade (1973) as a case study.
Methodology
At the outset, we compiled an Excel spreadsheet of Supreme Court cases using the
Case Citation Finder from the Supreme Court’s web site. The “master list,” as we dubbed it,
listed the official citation for each Supreme Court case, from the Burger Court (October
Term 1969) to the present.9 We used the master list to log the opinion announcements we
listened to and track the oral dissents we found.
With the list in place, we determined that we needed to work on it collaboratively.
We also started gathering copious amounts of supporting documentation, particularly news
articles from ProQuest Historical Newspapers, and realized that we were in need of a central
repository. After evaluating several vendors, including Google Docs, and receiving advice
from a fellow law librarian, we began using Huddle to share our work with one another.10

announcement of a dissenting opinion each Term. It was shortly after Byron White and I advised Justice Scalia of
that tradition that he delivered his first, and probably most notable, oral dissent in the independent counsel case.”).

Since the Supreme Court hands down many opinions late in the term, May, June and July are popular, though not
exclusive months, see, e.g., Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984) (decided
Jan. 17, 1984; Blackmun, J., dissenting orally), for oral dissents.
9
We investigated using the ALLCOURT database compiled by Harold J. Spaeth and housed at the Judicial
Research Initiative, http://www.cas.sc.edu/poli/juri/sctdata.htm, but did not have ready access to statistical software
on our home computers and felt that a straightforward list with the names of the cases would be most useful to us in
our compiling and annotating.
10
We thank Kumar Jayasuriya for suggesting Huddle. Huddle allowed us to set up various folders in a passwordprotected environment and to store our changing versions of our master list and our supporting documentation in one
workspace. Wikis, such as PBWorks, also offer an easy way to navigate through large amounts of material.

Supreme Court Resources
The U.S. Reports contain the official written opinions of the Court, but are not an oral
dissent text source. We knew that more recent oral dissents had not been published in the
U.S. Reports, but we also searched for some earlier dissents. We found only one instance of
an oral dissent published in the U.S. Reports: a Justice Bradley dissent from 1885.11
The Supreme Court Journal,12 which contains the official minutes of the Court, did
not begin consistently logging the dissenting opinion announcements until October Term
2002, using the language “Dissenting opinion announced by” in its opinion summaries. Prior
to this time, the Journal noted some dissenting opinion announcements in its index or text,
but not with reliable consistency. For example, the index from October Term 199813
contains Justice Scalia’s oral dissent in Chicago v. Morales (1999), but omits the fact that
Justice Ginsburg read her dissent a week later in Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. v.
Alliance Bond Fund, Inc. (1999). In complex cases, it can be difficult to ferret out an oral
dissent in the Journal. The Journal entry for Demore v. Kim (2003)14 illustrates how the
summary of the holding does not allow for an easy search on “dissenting opinion
announced.”
The justices’ personal papers provide original, firsthand accounts of some oral
dissents,15 and valuable information about the Supreme Court audio recordings, but were
not ideal sources of information for this project in other ways. As of this writing, only certain
papers are open to researchers.16 Due to copyright restrictions and the sheer volume of
materials, 17 the papers are not online and, therefore, searching through them requires a

Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Erie & Western Transp. Co., 118 U.S. 210 (1886) (“an imperfect copy of [Justice Bradley’s

researcher to be on-site.18 Moreover, oral dissent materials are not always where one may
expect to find them. In the William O. Douglas Papers, for example, we discovered a
memorandum that verified that Justice Douglas announced his dissents in Younger v. Harris
(1971) and Boyle v. Landry (1971), but it was contained in the Perez v. Ledesma (1971)
folder, another case that was announced on the same day.19
Articles and Books
Most of our leads came from secondary sources including: newspapers in Lexis,
Newspaper Archive, ProQuest, and Westlaw; journals and law reviews in HeinOnline, JSTOR,
Lexis, Westlaw, and Google Scholar; and books in Google Books and HeinOnline. We quickly
learned that the phrase “oral dissent” is not common terminology, so searching for phrases
like “read aloud” or “from the bench” in conjunction with “Supreme Court,” and other
variations, proved useful.20 It may be that researchers will find other articles using
variations of “high court” or “read aloud” or other language capturing a dissent from the
bench, especially given the number of articles such searches yield; however, our searches
generally produced the same articles and cases reassuring us that we had exhausted the
sources available to us.
Since authors do not always use the term “oral dissent” to describe a dissenting
statement, the term is rarely indexed and, given the number of books about the Supreme
Court and its justices, we considered it most productive to stick with electronic searching for
books.21 Even when searching, we sometimes discovered issues with citations to the oral
dissents such as citations to the written opinion22 or no citation for the proposition at all.23

18

We did, however, receive extraordinary long-distance assistance from archivists John Jacobs at Washington and
Lee University School of Law and Sarah Wilson at Stanford Law School. We are indebted to them for their
assistance with the Powell and Rehnquist Papers, respectively.

when O’Connor for the first time in her tenure offered a dissent from the bench.”) This oral dissent was located
through a Google Books search of the book. A perusal of the index itself does not reference this material under
dissent, oral dissent, opinion, or even, O’Connor, and would be difficult to locate manually without reading the book
in its entirety. Nevertheless, we read some books in their entirety, such as Linda Greenhouse’s Becoming Justice
Blackmun, due to its copious references to the Blackmun papers.

We faced similar hurdles with respect to the results from our news searching. We
discovered that many news articles used words like “said” or “delivered” with respect to
dissenting opinions, but this language did not necessarily mean that the justice spoke from
the bench. Instead, it could simply refer to an opinion that was filed with the Clerk of the
Court. When news articles referenced oral dissents, it was sometimes necessary to perform
a second search to determine the name of the case discussed. We found it most helpful if
the news article gave identification information, such as the case name or docket number,24
but this didn’t always happen.25 While cross-referencing was time-consuming and detailoriented, electronic resources such as ProQuest Historical Newspapers and Google Books
made this project significantly easier than it would have been just a few years ago. We
expect that additional oral dissents will be revealed as advancements in technology
continue.
Audio Recordings
Supreme Court opinion announcement audio is not comprehensive for this
timeframe. Originally, we planned to use Oyez’s opinion announcement audio as a
secondary check on our research.26 When we started our project, only a handful of relevant
terms had significant audio representation on Oyez. During the course of our research,
however, Oyez released copious amounts of opinion announcement audio (and transcribed
audio) making the site a primary source for information. As of this writing, Oyez has
released approximately 2,100-plus opinion announcements of the over 4,500 opinion
announcements for this timeframe. Together, we listened to over 2,200 opinion
announcements via Oyez’s automatic RSS/Podcast/iTunes feed27 and the NARA audio
cassettes, logging our progress and any unusual occurrences, such as incomplete or
incomprehensible recordings.28

26
The Oyez Project, http://www.oyez.org, offers digital audio of selected Supreme Court oral arguments and, most
recently, select opinion announcements. The term “Oyez” comes from the call “Oyez Oyez Oyez” announced at the
start of each Supreme Court session.

The feed enabled us to set up our computers to automatically track any new opinion announcements that were
added to the site. Each case was checked off our master list after we listened to it on Oyez and confirmed whether it
did or did not have a dissent.

While greatly aiding our research and producing several “finds,” not all opinion
announcement audio for this time period is currently available via the Oyez web site, and
some audio may simply not exist. Oyez is currently undergoing a project to load all the
opinion announcement audio available at NARA to the internet.29 However, according to
Oyez, not all opinion announcements were transmitted from the Supreme Court to NARA in
the first place:
Though the Court recorded all public sessions, it did not always deliver all
recorded sessions to the Archives. For a period in the 1980s, Court officials
archived recordings from days of oral argument, withholding opinion
announcements from its archival responsibility. The National Archives did not
routinely accession opinion announcements, however. Thus, with access to
the original master tapes submitted to the Archives, it is now possible to
make public the announcement of opinions whenever possible. We do so
whenever possible at The Oyez Project.30
Correspondence in the justices’ papers on this point is particularly illuminating. A
1991 memorandum to Justice White from Alfred Wong, then Marshal of the Supreme Court,
reviewed the taping procedures with respect to oral arguments and opinion announcements.
In the memo, Wong stated:
Over the years, all proceedings in the Courtroom were recorded, including
opinions from the Bench. A period of a number of years followed where
opinions were deliberately omitted. Then later all proceedings again were
recorded. At the present time an attempt is being made to record opinions on
a single tape. This is possible only on non-argument days. On argument days,
the opinions are included just prior to beginning of oral argument. Needless to
say, the recording of opinions over the years has been hodge-podge and
guidance is necessary.31
Wong elaborated that the agreement between the Court and NARA with respect to
the tapes did not expressly mention the opinion announcements and was primarily
focused on the taping of oral arguments. As such, the Marshal’s Office sought
counsel from the Conference as to whether recording of the opinion announcements
could be discontinued. A document entitled “Taping in the Courtroom,” attached to

(1976), at http://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1975/1975_74_942 (audio speeds up and slows down during
playback).
29
In making these audio recordings accessible via the internet, the Oyez Project has made significant contributions
to making studies such as this one possible. In the past, the only method available for studying the opinion
announcements would have been to visit NARA in person, requiring an extremely large time investment.

the memo, detailed the procedures used by the Marshal’s Office for making the
recordings in the courtroom.
Almost three weeks later, Justice Kennedy circulated a memorandum to the
Conference summarizing the justices’ conclusion that they “agreed at [their] last
meeting that [the Court] should tape the announcement of opinions from the
bench.”32 Clarifying the release of the tapes at NARA, Justice Kennedy recommended
“treating the tapes of oral announcements and tapes of arguments in the same
way.”33 The Court’s response to the opinion announcement audio may have signaled
a shift in views amongst Court members from just twenty years earlier. In January
1973, Justice Blackmun circulated a memorandum to the Conference34 seeking
review of his eight-page opinion announcement that he planned to release to the
press for two upcoming abortion cases, Roe v. Wade (1973) and Doe v. Bolton
(1973). Justice Brennan wrote back to him, advising that “Our practice in the past
has always been not to record oral announcements of opinions in order to avoid the
possibility that the announcement will be relied upon as the opinion or as
interpreting the filed opinion.”35 In this instance, Justice Brennan appeared to be
referring to “recording” as the documentation of the opinion announcements, but it is
still a strong message that opinion announcements are not legal authority and thus
treated subordinately to other proceedings before the Court.
The Supreme Court audio recordings at NARA vary in formats, from reel-to-reel
tapes, to audio cassettes, to compact discs.36 Since the Court’s agreement with NARA was
to provide the oral arguments, transmittal of opinion announcement audio was not a
primary goal. As such, opinion announcement audio is not in the collection for some cases,
and NARA arranges the audio by oral argument date. In other words, to find an opinion
announcement recording at NARA, one needs to cross-reference the recording containing
the oral argument released on the same day as the opinion announcement. Since the Court
often releases opinions on non-argument days, particularly at the end of the term when

collection. That said, the Court has started transmitting audio for non-argument day
opinions allowing for preservation of these announcements going forward.37
The following table illustrates the completeness of our audio examination. Given the
breadth of this project, it was necessary to use the audio available at Oyez rather than
consult the NARA audio as a matter of course.38 We expect that the completeness of the
audio listening portion will increase as additional opinion announcement audio is loaded to
Oyez or, alternatively, if more time is devoted to the NARA recordings in the future.

Includes logged cases from our master list for those listened to via Oyez (2,154) and at NARA (60 total: 5 from
OT1979, 13 from OT1992, 27 from OT1995, and 15 from OT1996). At the outset, we intended to separate out
unanimous opinions from our listening, but decided to include them to catch any anomalies that may have occurred.

Compiled by adding the “Number of written opinions of the Court” and the “Per curiam opinions in argued cases”
figures from the Statistics tables in the Supreme Court Journal. These numbers were selected because they reflected
the same numbers used by Chief Justice Burger in a July 2, 1984 memorandum to the Conference about the status of
opinions announced during OT 1981-1983 (on file with the Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, William J.
Brennan Jr. Papers, Box I:632, Opinion Announcements folder). We did not eliminate unanimous opinions from this
total, thus the results could be even more complete than shown in the table, albeit only slightly.

Case Study: Roe v. Wade
An interesting, and somewhat overwhelming, aspect to this project was that any
time we discovered a lead but could not confirm it, pursuing the lead became its own
research question. For example, if an author claimed a justice issued an oral dissent in a
particular case, but only offered the opinion as the source of authority, we would search
news, journal, audio, book, and manuscript sources, among others, to try to substantiate
the lead.
Roe v. Wade (1973) provides a good example. Sources claimed that both Justices
White and Rehnquist read oral dissents in Roe. One book cited the written opinions in the
case,41 while another cited to a Bill Moyers interview of Justice Blackmun in 1987.42
Fortunately, we were able to track down the interview, now on the somewhat outdated
technology of VHS, and watch it. In the interview, Justice Blackmun confirms at least one
dissenting statement in Roe, but does not state who issued the oral dissent(s).43
Oyez provides the oral argument and the oral re-argument audio for Roe v. Wade,
but not the opinion announcement audio. The index to the recordings at NARA shows no
tape from the date of the decision, January 22, 1973. It was a Monday non-argument day
and, at that time in the Court’s history, the Court focused on recording oral arguments, not
opinion announcements.
Although Roe v. Wade received widespread media attention, and still garners
considerable commentary today, the focus tends to be on the decision itself, not the opinion
announcement. Even Justice Blackmun commented that the cases did not receive as much
media attention as expected when first issued.44 A check of several major newspapers, both
on ProQuest and on microfilm at the Library of Congress, yielded nothing further regarding
possible oral dissents.
The Blackmun Papers are similarly silent on the issue of oral dissents in this case,
although Justice Blackmun, the author of the majority opinion, was known to keep

meticulous files. Justice Blackmun’s oral history interviews45 revealed that Justice White
issued an oral dissent. Yet, this still did not confirm whether then-Justice Rehnquist
delivered his dissent from the bench. Fortunately, the Rehnquist papers opened in late
2008, for the October 1972-1974 terms, the time period that includes the Roe v. Wade
(1973) case file.46 However, further research in these papers revealed nothing more. As of
this writing, we still only have confirmation that Justice White orally dissented in Roe v.
Wade (1973).
In sum, our methodology allowed us to handle the various resource changes we
experienced, such as the sudden increase in opinion announcement audio via Oyez, and
gave us the ability to follow many leads. As our case list filled in and our results began to
reveal themselves to us, we noticed some aspects of oral dissents that may be of particular
interest to Supreme Court researchers. The following section describes how the manner in
which oral dissents are delivered or the types of opinions in which they occur may impact a
researcher’s ability to find them.
Interesting Aspects for Researchers
Delivery of Oral Dissents
The way a justice delivers a dissent from the bench may bear upon the likelihood of
finding the text. Several of Justice Black’s oral dissents have been described as “ad-libbed”
such as his oral dissents in Goldberg v. Kelly (1970)47 and Whiteley v. Warden (1971)48
suggesting that a prepared text may not exist (and may never have existed). Justice
Blackmun, however, who recommended ending the tradition of announcing opinions from
the bench altogether, prepared dissenting statement drafts, many of which are available in
his personal papers at the Library of Congress.49 Justice Powell also prepared dissenting

LINDA GREENHOUSE, BECOMING JUSTICE BLACKMUN 43 (2006) (noting Justice Blackmun’s distaste for opinion
announcement). Oral dissent texts in the Harry A. Blackmun Papers at the Library of Congress, in the respective
case files, include those prepared for: Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727 (1972); Regents of the University of
California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978); Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368 (1979); Lassiter v. Department

copy of the slip opinion with marked portions of text to read.

statement drafts, the texts of which are available in his personal papers at Washington and
Lee University School of Law.50 The text of Justice Brennan’s statement in Regents of the
University of California v. Bakke (1978) can be found amongst the twenty-four folders of
material he kept for that case.51 The files of other justices are less complete. Justice
Marshall’s dissenting statement in Milliken v. Bradley (1974) appears in his papers at the
Library of Congress52, although other oral dissent texts such as those from Regents of the
University of California v. Bakke (1978) and United States v. Ross (1982) are not found
there. Justice Douglas’ and Justice Black’s files offered occasional proof that they issued
oral dissents, either through memoranda or news clippings, respectively, but their files did
not contain any oral dissent texts.
Sometimes a justice will read a dissenting statement on behalf of another justice, as
was the case in Justice Douglas’ oral dissent in Milliken v. Bradley (1974). Like Justice
Marshall, Justice Douglas issued an oral dissent in Milliken but Justice Brennan delivered the
statement on Justice Douglas’ behalf. When one justice announces a dissent on behalf of
another, researchers may have trouble correctly identifying the person actually holding the
dissenting view, especially researchers listening to audio, but may have added manuscript
collection choices for retrieving the text.
Type of Opinion
The kind of opinion the Court issues can impact the finding process as well. Plurality
opinions, in which there is no opinion supported by the majority of the Court, may be
lengthy and intricate. The opinion announcement in Regents of the University of California
v. Bakke (1978), for example, lasted over one hour - well over four times the length of
most opinion announcements in this timeframe. Justice Powell stated the judgment of the
Court followed by Justices Stevens, Brennan, Blackmun and Marshall who each announced
their dissenting and concurring views. The announcement of plurality opinions may also
sound unusual due to the number of speakers. For example, Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992) was authored and announced by three justices - Justices
O’Connor, Kennedy and Souter. Each read the majority opinion while Chief Justice
The dissenting statement texts available include those prepared for: Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975) (noting “as
delivered from bench the day this case was handed down”); Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482 (1977) (noting “text
of oral delivery of my dissent on 3/23”); Agosto v. INS, 436 U.S. 748 (1978) (including the line “what prompts me
to speak at this length in dissent”); TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978) (starting “I dissent orally”) and Davis v.
Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979) (noting “dissent from the bench.”).

Rehnquist announced his dissent.53 We included dissenting statements from plurality
opinions.
Split majority rulings may also pose challenges to those listening to opinion
announcement audio. Justice Stevens’ dissenting statement in United States v. Booker
(2005) occurs in the middle of the opinion announcement unlike most others, which occur at
the end.54 In Booker, Justice Stevens announced the opinion of the Court, that the
sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional as applied; then Justice Breyer announced the
opinion of the Court with respect to the remedy. Before switching speakers, Justice Stevens
stated “[b]efore Justice Breyer begins his announcement, I shall briefly state that the four
Justices who do not join the Court’s remedial conclusion believe that it is not necessary to
invalidate any part of the guidelines or the sentencing statute”55 before explaining the
dissenters' reasoning for these views.
Similarly, concurring statements can be deceptive as they sound like oral dissents
but on closer examination prove to be otherwise. Concurring announcements happen when
a justice agrees with the majority’s holding but disagrees with its reasoning. By definition,
concurring statements do not proclaim the minority view. We chose not to include them in
our list of cases and did not search for them separately since they are not oral dissents,
though we made note of oral concurring opinions when we encountered them along the
way.56 However, we did include oral statements when a justice concurred in part and
dissented in part, as we found them to be more akin to dissents than concurrences.57

reversed and that today's ruling leaves it only barely intact.”).
54
Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279 (1991), is another example of this type of fractured opinion. Described by
the Court as "another kettle of fish," Justice White delivered the majority as to part of the opinion; Chief Justice
Rehnquist then announced his three-part opinion, part of which is a dissent, part of which is the majority; and finally
Justice White announced his oral dissent.

Justice Rehnquist’s one-sentence summary of the dissenting part of his opinion in Arizona v. Fulminante (1991) as
an oral dissent because it appeared to be only a cursory mention in order to give context to the majority part of his
opinion. See The Oyez Project, Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279 (1991), http://oyez.org/cases/19901999/1990/1990_89_839 (Opinion Announcement, C.J. Rehnquist at 1:21).

As expected, many blockbuster cases had oral dissents such as abortion, death
penalty, private conduct, school busing, flag burning, and school desegregation cases.58 But
fairly technical cases garner dissenting statements too, such as Justice Blackmun’s oral
dissent in United States v. Foster Lumber Co. (1976), a complicated tax case, described as
“not one of general interest.”59
Adding to the unpredictable nature of oral dissents, the Rehnquist Court (1986–
2005) illustrated that oral dissents occurred in close cases as well as in those in which only
one justice wrote in dissent.60 Many 5-4, or otherwise close decisions receive oral dissents,
such as Justice Stevens’ oral dissent in Texas v. Johnson (1989), Justice Kennedy’s oral
dissent in Alexander v. United States (1993), and Justice Souter’s oral dissent in Alden v.
Maine (1999). In Pacific Mutual Life v. Haslip (1991), however, Justice O’Connor read her
full, lone dissenting opinion - the first oral dissent of her tenure.61
Surprisingly oral dissents occurred in per curiam opinions, such as Justice Douglas’
oral dissents in Jones v. Board of Ed. of Tenn. (1970) and United States v. Armour & Co.
(1970) and Justice Stewart’s oral dissent in Kentucky v. Whorton (1979). Since per curiam
opinions are not signed by a particular justice but rather issued by the Court as a whole,
they were unsuspected case candidates for oral dissents but yet provided unexpected finds.
Whatever can be said about searching for oral dissents, one thing is clear: justices
issue them when they feel strongly about the case at hand. Regarding his dissent in Herrera
v. Collins (1993), Justice Blackmun stated “I suspect I felt rather strongly about that one,
and thus, wrote and announced a dissent.”62 Justice Stevens once said he read a dissent
from the bench because he “didn't want his views to get lost in the shuffle of the day's

stated, “I think this is a very important case, and so … would like to state briefly, some of
the reasons for my dissent.”64 If a search engine allowed researchers to search by the field
“importance of issue to the justice,” our list would be complete.
Conclusion
Our goal is to present as complete a list as possible of Supreme Court cases, from
the Burger, Rehnquist, and Roberts Courts (October Term 1969–current) in which an oral
dissent was issued, along with citable support for each included case. Our list appears in the
accompanying Appendix. We used sources such as Supreme Court opinion announcement
audio via the Oyez Project, secondary sources, and the justices’ papers to compile our list
and we endeavored to capture the state of affairs in Supreme Court opinion announcement
audio as it exists at the National Archives. Finally, we pointed out any aspects of oral
dissents that may make some more difficult to find.
We plan to post this article, and to continue to update our list, on the Social Science
Research Network (“SSRN”). Ultimately, we would like to share our results with
organizations that are compiling freely accessible versions of Supreme Court data, such as
The Oyez Project or The Supreme Court Database.65 Our goal is to make our work readily
available to those studying the Supreme Court, and particularly, those interested in
Supreme Court oral dissents. We intend to start including oral dissents prior to October
Term 1969 as time permits, and we welcome leads and comments regarding our work.

Appendix: Oral Dissents, October Term 1969-Present
This list contains 161 oral dissents. Dissents are grouped by the term in which they
were decided, in ascending order by U.S. Reports citation. In cases with multiple dissents,
each justice’s dissent is listed separately, in ascending order of seniority. We have not
included cases in this list unless we could verify the oral dissent through some type of
contemporaneous authority, such as the audio recording, a news article from the time
period, or the justices’ papers. Also note that the list below is not exhaustive in terms of
sources. For purposes of brevity, we have contained the Appendix to no more than two or
three sources per dissent.
Since concurring statements do not proclaim the minority view, they are not included
in this list and we did not search separately for them, though we made note of oral
concurring opinions when we encountered them along the way.66 We did include statements
for opinions that were concurring in part and dissenting in part, as we found them more
akin to dissents.67 If an oral dissent was issued in addition to an oral concurrence or a
fractured majority opinion, such as a plurality or a split majority, it is included in this list.68
Finally, we are aware that additional oral dissents may be discovered as information
becomes more readily accessible online, and we invite others to send their suggestions.
