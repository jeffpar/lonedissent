## Lone Dissent Data Files

While all these files are generated by scripts in the [Lone Dissent](https://lonedissent.org) repository, their data comes
from a variety of sources, and whenever the data from those sources gets "refreshed", there are a series of checks that must
be rerun and a variety of corrections (some automated, some not) that must be reapplied.

For example, when new SCDB data files were downloaded in May 2021, the following initial steps were required:

1. Added new SCDB CSV files to `/sources/scdb`:
    - SCDB_2020_01_caseCentered_Citation.csv
    - SCDB_2020_01_caseCentered_Docket.csv
    - SCDB_2020_01_justiceCentered_Citation.csv
    - SCDB_Legacy_06_caseCentered_Citation.csv
    - SCDB_Legacy_06_justiceCentered_Citation.csv
2. Updated `/sources/scdb/combine.sh` to create a new `/sources/scdb/decisions.csv`:
    > cat SCDB_Legacy_06_justiceCentered_Citation.csv > decisions.csv
    > tail -n +2 SCDB_2020_01_justiceCentered_Citation.csv >> decisions.csv
3. Ran `gulp decisions` to create new decisions.json in `/sources/ld` from decisions.csv
4. Ran `gulp fixDecisions --dates --overwrite` to fix all decision and argument dates in decisions.json (using `/sources/ld/dates.csv`)
5. Fixed a number of [Natural Court errors](#scdb-natural-court-errors) in decisions.json, as reported by `gulp coalitions`

There are many more corrections left to make (eg, see my [blog post](https://lonedissent.org/blog/2019/02/18/)), which will
need to be addressed at a later date.

### SCDB Natural Court Errors

A significant number of Natural Court errors remain in the 2021 SCDB data; here's an easy one:

- Case 2018-003 should be natural court 1707, not 1706

Other errors are more complicated.  For example, the "Stone 2" court (1202) was assigned the wrong start date.  Instead of:

    1201    Stone 1	July 03, 1941 - February 15, 1943
    1202	Stone 2	July 03, 1941 - September 30, 1945
    1203	Stone 3	October 01, 1945 - June 23, 1946

it should have been:

    1201    Stone 1	July 03, 1941 - February 14, 1943
    1202	Stone 2	February 15, 1943 - September 30, 1945
    1203	Stone 3	October 01, 1945 - June 23, 1946

Stone was promoted to Chief Justice on Jul 3, 1941 and Byrnes joined on Jul 8, 1941, so it's reasonable
to combine those two events and set the start of the "Stone 1" court to Jul 3.  Byrnes left on Oct 3, 1942
and apparently his seat wasn't filled until Feb 15, 1943 when Rutledge joined.

"Stone 2" extended from Feb 15, 1943 through Sep 30, 1945, when Roberts retired (he actually retired Jul 31, 1945)
and Burton joined Oct 1, 1945.

"Stone 3" extended from Oct 1, 1945 through Apr 22, 1946, when Stone died.  Vinson didn't become his replacement
until Jun 24, 1946, so the Stone court officially ended on Jun 23.

Consequently, I changed naturalCourt to 1201 for all cases with naturalCourt of 1202 and dateDecision < 1943-02-15.

Next, for the following cases decided on 1943-02-15, SCDB assumed that Justice Rutledge had participated; it's extremely
unlikely Rutledge participated in decisions released on the same day that he joined, but all I've done is mark these cases
as "Stone 2":

    justice WBRutledge in case 1942-093 not found in court Stone 1
    justice WBRutledge in case 1942-122 not found in court Stone 1
    justice WBRutledge in case 1942-123 not found in court Stone 1
    justice WBRutledge in case 1942-124 not found in court Stone 1
    justice WBRutledge in case 1942-125 not found in court Stone 1

A similar problem existed with the "Chase 1" court: numerous "Chase 1" cases reported that JPBradley and WStrong
had voted, but they were not part of that court.  "Chase 1" existed Dec 15, 1864 through Mar 13, 1870, whereas Strong joined
Mar 14, 1870 and Bradley joined Mar 23, 1870 (ie, part of "Chase 2").

Some "Chase 1" cases had another problem; for example, case 1868-109 was decided on 1870-02-28, and by that time, of the 10
justices who began serving on "Chase 1", Catron died May 30, 1865, Wayne died July 5, 1867, and Grier retired Jan 31, 1870,
so only 7 justices were on the court when case 1868-109 was decided.

Such errors would have been easy to catch if SCDB had assigned exactly one court definition to exactly one set of justices,
but they chose to adopt the "natural court" definitions created by the Supreme Court compendium, which are centered on when
members joined the Court, not when they left.  It's likely that many more such errors remain.

All the other problematic "Chase 1" cases simply had the wrong naturalCourt value (601 instead of 602), since they had been
decided *after* the March 1870 dates that Strong and Bradley had joined.

Next, after fixing a number of mis-appearances by Justice Strong in various "Waite 3" cases (instead of Justice Woods), that
left the following 12 issues, which remain for another day:

    warning: case 1792-001 refers to justice TJohnson, not present in court Jay 2
    warning: case 1804-004 refers to justice WJohnson, not present in court Marshall 1
    warning: case 1845-013 refers to justice SNelson, not present in court Taney 5
    warning: case 1850-162 refers to justice LWoodbury, not present in court Taney 9
    warning: case 1865-076 refers to justice RBTaney, not present in court Chase 1
    warning: case 1871-183 refers to justice WHunt, not present in court Chase 2
    warning: case 1876-085 refers to justice JHarlan1, not present in court Waite 1
    warning: case 1876-085 refers to justice WBWoods, not present in court Waite 1
    warning: case 1876-085 refers to justice SMatthews, not present in court Waite 1
    warning: case 1876-085 refers to justice HGray, not present in court Waite 1
    warning: case 1876-085 refers to justice SBlatchford, not present in court Waite 1
    warning: case 1893-077 refers to justice HEJackson, not present in court Fuller 4

I've saved a copy of the final decisions.json as `decisions-step5.json`, so by comparing that to `decisions-step4.json` (which
was created at step 4 above, with the command `gulp fixDecisions --dates --overwrite`), all the natural court corrections can be verified.

### Women Advocates

The [Women Advocates](https://github.com/jeffpar/lonedissent/blob/master/sources/ld/women-advocates.csv)
CSV file is generated from [data](https://supremecourthistory.org/history_oral_advocates.html) which
[Marlene Trestman](https://www.marlenetrestman.com) painstakingly extracted from the
[Journals of the Supreme Court of the United States](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/journal.aspx) for
October Term 1880 through October Term 1999, and which Julie Silverbrook and Emma Shainwald supplemented with data from
2000 through 2016.  We then extended the data through the end of February 2019, consulting a combination of Journals and
[Transcripts](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2018).

The Women Advocates data was then run through a series of validation checks, and a handful of errors were corrected,
all of which should be noted in a "corrections" field in the CSV file.  For example, Deborah C. Wyatt was listed in the
original [PDF](https://supremecourthistory.org/assets/history_oral_advocates_1880_1999.pdf) as Woman Advocate #218 and #222.
It's always possible there were two individuals with that same name, but it seems unlikely.  We also tried to "normalize" all
the names, so that all appearances by the same person use the same name.  Some names may have changed over time (e.g., if
they married and took their spouse's last name), but hopefully all the records in the spreadsheet use the advocate's original
name, so that we don't misinterpret the same person as two different people.

### Advocate Updates

While checking Edwin Kneedler's list of arguments in the journals, I noticed that his February 24, 2020 argument
is accompanied by the following acknowledgement:

	The Chief Justice said:
	“Mr. Clement, our records indicate that this was your 100th oral argument before the Court. That is a rare milestone.
	I recognize one of the other members of the exclusive club, Mr. Kneedler, at counsel table.

	“Throughout your career, Mr. Clement, you have consistently advocated positions on behalf of the United States and
	private clients in an exemplary manner.

	“On behalf of the Court, I extend to you our appreciation for your advocacy before the Court and dedicated service as
	an officer of this Court. We look forward to hearing from you many more times--beginning, I gather, next week as an amicus
	appointed by this Court.”

However, in Paul Clement's spreadsheet, his 2020-02-24 argument is listed as #99, so apparently we're missing 1 of his
arguments.
