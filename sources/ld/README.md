## Lone Dissent Data Files

While all these files are generated by scripts in the [Lone Dissent](https://lonedissent.org) repository, their data comes from
a variety of sources.

For example, the [Women Advocates](https://github.com/jeffpar/lonedissent/blob/master/sources/ld/women-advocates.csv)
CSV file is generated from [data](https://supremecourthistory.org/history_oral_advocates.html) which [Marlene Trestman](https://www.marlenetrestman.com)
painstakingly extracted from the [Journals of the Supreme Court of the United States](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/journal.aspx) for
October Term 1880 through October Term 1999, and which Julie Silverbrook and Emma Shainwald supplemented with data from 2000 through 2016.
We then extended the data through the end of February 2019, consulting a combination of Journals and [Transcripts](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2018).

The Women Advocates data was then run through a series of validation checks, and a handful of errors were corrected, all of which
should be noted in a "corrections" field in the CSV file.  For example, Deborah C. Wyatt was listed in the original [PDF](https://supremecourthistory.org/assets/history_oral_advocates_1880_1999.pdf)
as Woman Advocate #218 and #222.  It's always possible there were two individuals with that same name, but it seems unlikely.  We also
tried to "normalize" all the names, so that all appearances by the same person use the same name.  Some names may have changed over
time (e.g., if they married and took their spouse's last name), but hopefully all the records in the spreadsheet use the advocate's
original name, so that we don't misinterpret the same person as two different people.
