PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-533, Jess H. Hisquierdo versus Angela Hisqulerdo.
Mr. Endman, you may proceed, I think.
ORAL, ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. ENDMAN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ENDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The within matter was commenced on January 9fch,
1375 when the petitioner filed a petition for -the dissolution
of his marriage.

This is equivalent to a divorce in other

states .
The facts stated in his petition indicated that the
parties were married in September 1953 and separated in July
1972.

Prior to his marriage,

the petitioner was working for

the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad and had been so
employed since Junes 1942.
In April 1975 he changed his employment to the
Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal.
of railroad connected employment,

With over 30 years

the petitioner will be

eligible for his retirement benefits when he reached age 60.
He is presently 57 years of age.
The trial court was called upon to consider whether
the future benefits are community property.

It was the trial

court's determination that there is no community interest in

4
petitioner's Railroad Retirement Fund.
The wife filed an appeal to the California District
Court of Appeals, and the District Court of Appeals affirmed
basing their opinion on the Supremacy Clause in the preemption
of this field by Congress»
QUESTION;

Under California lav/, setting aside the

community property division, could the divorce court, after
dividing the property, say I am going to give "X" dollars of
alimony which will be paid out of the Retirement Fund when it
becomes payable and under which it would be deferred presumably
three years on your figures?
MR, ENDMAN:

The rules of law as property division

and the rules relating to spousal support, as we call it, which
is equivalent to alimony, are completely different.

Alimony or

spousal support would be based solely on the needs and ability
of the parties,
QUESTION;

Well, I am assuming he found a need and

the ability is the Fund,
MR. ENDMAN:

I think then that under 42 USC 659, I

think, or 28 USC 659 that that could be executed upon the
Railroad Retirement. Fuad in order to enforce payment.
QUESTION:
MR. ENDMAN:

Notwithstanding any Federal statute?
Well, I think the Federal statute

specifically allows the immunity of the exemption clause not
to apply to the spousal support and child support provisions.

5
So if California made a provision for spousal support,
then, of course, they could execute upon the Railroad Retire­
ment Fund as well as any other property that —
QUESTION:

As a practical matter, if you care to,

itfould you suggest why that was not the solution to this problem,
instead of having it go all the route up here?
MR. ENDMAN:

Well,

as a practical matter, both parties

waived spousal support at the initiation of the proceedings
in the trial courts.
QUESTION:

You mean they wanted to have a lawsuit

decided?
MR. ENDMAN:

No, this issue — the spouse waived

her rights to spousal support.

What the reason for Ms.

Kisquierdo's attorney, I do not know, b*it ■—
QUESTION:
way.

They want to get more money in a specific

They do not want it by the alimony route.
MR. ENDMAN:

Is that it?

That was their presumed intent.

do not know what went on in their mind.

I

I think what they

attempted to do was to try and get the house free and clear
of any other obligations.
QUESTION:

Well, may it not have been a reliance

on their part — on the proposition that the Retirement Benefit
was community property and, therefore, that the claim for
alimony would be less substantial or less compelling from the
point of view of the wife?

6
MR., EN DMAN;

As I recall, there was no attempt

ever to obtain a pro rata payment.

The sole attempt by the

spouse's attorneys — and they never put on any evidence to
this effect, although they indicated in a trial brief that
they intended to find the present actuarial value of the
Railroad Retirement Benefits and offset that against the house,
which v/as ultimately awarded to the husband in this case, and
out of that house he is making payments to equalize the
division.
But to my recollection there Y*as no real attempt
on their part to se;ek a pro rata share.
The District Court of Appeals, having affirmed the
lower court, the petitioner — or the respondent in this
matter thereupon petitioned the California Supreme Court for
hearing.

Hearing was granted by the California Supreme Court

and they reversed this matter, holding in effect that the
field had not been preempted end petitioner's entitlement to
Railroad Retirement Fund benefits could be subjected to the
California Community Property laws.
Following that opinion, petitioner herein filed to
this Court for a writ of certiorari pursuant to 28 USC 12!»7,
sub-paragraph 3, contesting the validity of the California
Community Property laws requiring equal division of community
property in the Federal Retirement Act.
The issue presented in this case is whether in a

7
divorce proceeding the trial court can award any portion of
the railroad-connected employee’s future entitlement to
benefits to anyone other than the employee»
We are really concerned with three inquiries in
deciding the issue of preemption»

First, does the Act of

Congress touch a field in which the Federal interest is so
dominant that the Federal system will be assumed to preclude
enforcement of state laws?
Two, has Congress either explicitly or implicitly
declared that the State Community Property laws are prohibited
from regulating in this area?
And three, and even if Congress has not completely
foreclosed the State legislation, is the State statute void
because they actually conflict with a valid Federal act?
QUESTION:

Mr» Endman, you say the question is whether

the California State court can award any part of the retirement
benefit.

Would it make any difference if you rephrase the

question to say:

Is the California court entitled to treat

pension benefits as community property?
MR, ENDMAN:

I think partly true and partly incorrect»

I think the -- whichever way California treats it, whether
it is community property or separate property, the exemption
statute makes it clear that they cannot touch at all — and I
will get into this in a short while — but they cannot touch
the railroad retirement benefits.

So whichever way California

8

analogizes it, whether community or not, the area has been
preempted by Congress.
QUESTION;

Well, is it not possible that there might

be a procedural impediment to the California courts directing
disposition of particular Federal checks received by your
client, but that it nonetheless might be entitled to treat
the property which those checks embodied as community property
for purposes of dividing the funds of the community upon
dissolution of the marx'iage?
MR. ENDMAN:

Well, I think the exemption statute

states that the railroad retirement benefits are not subject
to any legal process„

And I submit that a divorce proceeding

is a legal process.
The exemption statute provides that they are not
subject to an anticipation.

And if the court in a divorce

proceeding provides thc,t in the future he is going to get some
benefits and, based on those future

entitlement benefits,

we are going to say that the other spouse is entitled to
something right now or some outside monies, then they are
anticipating this future entitlement.
QUESTION;

Well, is not Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s

point that granted everything you say, does that necessarily
mean you win your case?
MR. ENDMAN:

I think if the trial court is prevented

from taking into consideration the issue of Railroad Retirement

9

Fund —
QUESTIONS

Well, this is the next step.

It is taken

into consideration and maybe making your client discard
something else, wholly apart, from the inability to touch the
benefit fund.
MR, ENDMAN:

Well, I think this would be inconsistent

with the prohibition against a legal process and any legal
attempt on the part of the California courts to deal with the
Railroad Retirement Fund,
QUESTION:

Well, all I am suggesting — and I think

this is what Mr. Justice Rehnquist had in mind and I do not
believe you have answered it — is that all it is doing in
adding up assets is drawing

the benefit fund into the com­

putation without touching it, but drawing on some other assets
in

determining the appropriate share of the community.
MR. ENDMAN:
QUESTION:
MR. ENDMAN:

Well, that —
You say they cannot do this.
I say they cannot do this because that

would amount to an anticipation that there will be a receipt
of these benefits.
QUESTION:

You mean they cannot do indirectly what

they are prohibited by statute from doing directly, is that
it?
MR. ENDMAN:
QUESTION:

Exactly.
Well, is not that a little simplistic in

10
a sense, counsel?

Certainly after your client has deposited

his check in the bank that he receives from the pension benefits!
and it becomes in a general fund in his bank account, it can
be levied on, can it not?
MR. ENDMAN:
QUESTION:
MR. ENDMANs

I believe that there are cases for -For alimony — for alimony.
Oh, for alimony.

Well, I do not

contend that —
QUESTION:

Well, no.

I mean can not his bank account

be garnished after the check has cleared and that check is
in the bank?
MR. ENDMAN:

I believe there is an exemption — would

apply to any creditors and would continue as long as it is
in the bank.
Now there are cases cited by the respondent, which
indicate in their briefs that the exemption extends with
regard to Social Security Benefits even after the receipt of
those benefits, and even after they are placed in a bank
account, even after they are placed in a savings and loan
account, at least up until such time as they are invested in
some type of an investment other than just being readily
available for his necessities and needs in life.
Now I think this would apply to any creditors
including the spouse, other than the spouse's rights to spousal
support or alimony, as most states call it, or child support.

11
QUESTION:

Does your argument depend on equating

a decree of a divorce court with the language "garnishment,
attachment or other legal process" under 435 USC 231(m)?
MR. ENDMAN:

Yes, with the other legal process

portion of it, rather than the "garnishment or attachment",
QUESTION:

Does not the most recent amendments -—•

do not the most recent amendments forbid garnishment to
satisfy community property?
MR, ENDMAN:

Prior to leaving Los Angeles, at least

the supplement to our Code books indicated that —
QUESTION:
MR, ENDMAN:

Well, how about the 1977 amendments?
Well, I assume that would have been

in the '78 supplement, and that still is contained as Mr,
Justice Rehnquist indicated that "garnishment, attachment or
other legal process or nor shall any attempt be made to
anticipate those programs",
QUESTION:

How long does this exemption last?

He

gets a check from the Retirement Board in 1936 and he put it
in the bank.

How long does it last?

MR, ENDMAN:

I think under the cases that I

indicated cited by the respondents, that exemption would last
so long as it is in the bank available for his needs while
he is alive, and currently even to the extent -QUESTION:
MR. ENDMAN;

So it would last his lifetime.
Pardon?

12
QUESTION;

It would last his lifetime.

MR. ENDMAN:

It could last his lifetime as long as

they are left in a bank or savings and loan type investment,
where it is immediately available to him.
QUESTION;

But the protection would disappear if

he bought some real estate and sold it at a profit, and bought
some more real estate?

At what point does the protection

disappear?
MR. ENDMAN;

Well, I think the protection would

disappear when the monies were placed into an investment.

Now

that I would think would be when he bought the first real
estate that he was not living in.
QUESTION:

Well, how about if he put it in a mutual

fund?
MR. ENDMAN:
QUESTION;
MR. ENDMAN:
QUESTION:

A mutual fund?
Is that an investment?
I would consider that an investment.
Is that good or bad?

Can he get to it

or not?
MR. ENDMAN:

I think that could be gotten to in

a

mutual fund investment, since it is no longer immediately
available for his needs.
QUESTION:

The difference between a mutual fund and

the bank is -MR. ENDMAN:

I think a bank — you can go that day

13

to the bank to get some money for food or groceries or what
have you, and a mutual fund is a little more difficult,
requiring some clearance,
QUESTION:

Mr. Endman, is not the only issue before

us as to who owns the Retirement Benefit before it is actually
paid?

That is the only issue.

I do not think we even have

the issue you discussed earlier of whether the judge in
allocating property in the divorce case could take into account
the fact that there is going to be a benefit sometimes down
the road.

That is not before us either.
MR. ENDMAN:
QUESTION:
MR. ENDMAN:

No, that is — no, as I say —
Who owns the benefit?
It is who owns the benefit at this

point and whether the court can anticipate in receiving the
benefit.

As I pointed out in this case —
QUESTION:

The question is whether it would be

an anticipation within the meaning of the Federal statute
to apply to Community Property law and say it is now owned
half by the law.

That is the whole case, is it not?

MR. ENDMAN:

Right.

I submit to the court that under each of these
inquiries, the State law will be an obstacle to the preemption
of the Railroad Retirement Act.
First of all, the Railroad Retirement Act is an
appeal in which the Federal interest is so dominant that the

Federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of
state laws on the same subject.
We are actually here not dealing with any property
right.

What we have is a social insurance benefit to the

same extent as Social Security as was stated in the case of
Fleming versus Nestor.

The property right arises with respect

to pension plans by reason of a chosen action to wit the fact
that an employee worked for a company and it is part an element
of his compensation.
I realise that this court has stated in the case of
Herb versus Pitcairn that this court's po\*er over state
judgments is to correct them only to the extent that they
incorrectly adjudge Federal rights.

I submit that this is

just the case? that California has adjudged these non-contractual
rights to be contractual rights.
Social Security benefits and Railroad Retirement
Act benefits are essentially a part of the same social insurance
scheme.

Both systems are financed by a tax levied upon the

payrolls of the employees and their employers.

The proceeds

therefrom are paid into the United States Treasury.

Each year

an amount equal to the benefits and administrative expenses
are appropriated to a trust fund.
Furthermore, the Social Security Act is closely
coordinated with the Railroad Retirement Act.

Credits to the

Social Security system may be transferred from railroad service.

15
Automatic adjustments are made to the Railroad Retirement
system whenever the Social Security Act is amended.

Adjustment

for benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act are made whenever
the employee is eligible for benefits tinder the Social Security
Act.
QUESTION;

Well, if one could demonstrate that the

Railroad Retirement Act were contractual, would that hurt your
case?
MR. ENDMAN:

In this aspect, yes.

I do not think

it can be demonstrated because, using this fact as an example,
Mr. Hisquierdo works for Santa Fe, he works for the LA Passenger
Terminal; he does not work for the United States government.
There was no contract between him and the United States to
these benefits„
QUESTION:

But he had to perform services for Santa

Fe in order to acquire them.
MR. ENDMAN;

He performed services in order to be

eligible for the social insurance benefits.

That is the

foundation for the satisfaction of the eligibility requirements,
just as in Social Security there has to be 40 quarters of work
in order to qualify for Social Security.

Yet this Court has

said in Fleming versus Nestor that there are no contractual
rights thereto; that what we are dealing with is a statutory
right with no contractual elements involved.
QUESTION:

Well, would you think under your Fleming

16

against Nestor analogy that Congress, after this man had worked
20 years for Santa Fe Railroad and had an accrued pension right,
could simply declare

that he no longer had such a right?

MR. ENDMAN:

I do not think they can do that without

running into some problems with the due process clause, but —
and probably some other political ramifications.
QUESTION:

Sure, they are political then.

MR. ENDMAN:

I submit that both the Social Security

Act and the Railroad Retirement Act are part of the same
social insurance scheme.

Both were enacted pursuant to the

power to spend money in aid of the general welfare.

This

power, I submit, is strictly a Federal matter and should be
governed by Federal law without interference by the states„
QUESTION:

But what money is Congress spending in

this case?
MR. ENDMAN:

Congress — if the income is sufficient

— insufficient will by appropriations have to make funds.
And this is, of course, one of the problems that — in reading
the newspapers that the Social Security is running into is
that they are constantly raising the taxes to the point to
support these funds.
QUESTION:

Well, is there any indication that the

Santa Fe cannot meet the burden of its pensions; that it is
going to have to call on the government?
MR. ENDMAN:

Well, this is not a Santa Fe pension.

17
What we are dealing with is the U. S. government pension and
the question is whether the government will call upon Santa
Fe.
QUESTION:

You mean the pension checks actually come

from the government?
MR. ENDMANs

Yes, I believe that is the way it is.

I can only say I believe so because my client is not retired
and I have no idea where the pension will eventually come from,
but I believe it will be from the Railroad Retirement Board
itself..
Since I wish to reserve some time for rebuttal, I
just want to indicate that the scheme of the Railroad Retirement
Act is full and complete; that if we look at Section 231a,
sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), it is clear that the Railroad
Retirement entitlements to an annuity are to the individual
under that section.
If we look at sub-paragraph (c), we see that the
spouse of the individual is covered by her — by the spouse’s
annuity.

If we look under paragraph — sub-paragraph (d), we
%

find that survivors, widows, widowers, children and parents
also receive benefits.
Congress was explicit under 231d, sub-paragraph (c)
(3)(B), that entitlement of the spouse of an individual to
an annuity under 231a, sub-paragraph (c), shall end on the
last day of the month preceding a judgment of absolute divorce.

18

This Court in dealing with National Service Life
Insurance has spoken with the force and clarity that in directing
the proceeds to belong to a named beneficiary under the life
insurance that the states have no power to deal with those,
that the area has been preempted.
QUESTION j

Why do you say this Court spoke with

force and clarity in Wissner?
MR. ENDMAN;

Well, even though it was a divided

opinion, the opinion itself says that they have spoken with
force and — that Congress has spoken — excuse me.

I apologize.

I submit that under the Railroad Retirement Act
Congress has spoken with equal force and clarity that the
annuity belongs to the individual and no other; that the
spouse's annuity belongs to the spouse and no other; and
because the spouse will lose the spouse's annuity by reason
of a judgment of absolute divorce does not give that spouse
the right to claim a portion of the individual's annuity.
That annuity scheme is full; it is complete.

It

was made to — it is exclusive of state interference and that
state interference is excluded by reason of Section 231a and
m which we have already talked about.
I submit that Congress has considered the possibility
of termination of marriage by reason of Section 231m; that they
have made provisions as they saw fit;

that neither this

Court nor California has any place second-guessing the wisdom

19

of Congress,

If the spouse suffers a hardship as a result,

it is most unfortunate but it is for Congress to correct,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mrs. StlllasGA?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELINOR H. STILLMAN, ESQ.
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MRS. STILLMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the court;
The decision here on review directs the California
trial court in these divorce proceedings to apply California
Community Propert}/ law to annuity payments if the petitioner
is going to — is expecting to receive under the Railroad
Retirement Act when he retires.
The permitted result will be that the wife, the
respondent, will be ordered a proportional interest in those
payments either now through taking the interest — the value
of the interest out in other property, or at a later time
through taking it out from the payments as they mature — as
they accrue.
We submit that this application of State law in
either form conflicts with the Retirement Act.

I think I

would like to clarify at this point that the United States
is not claiming that there is a preemption of the field of
domestic law here.

We look at this more narrowly, that there

is simply a conflict between terms of this court and this
particular application of California law to these annuity

20

payments which are a Federal deficit.
California is perfectly entitled to set up a scheme
similar to this of its own and call it property and say it
can be anticipated and treated under whatever categories it
wishes.

It simply cannot act on these Federal payments.
QUESTION^

Mrs. Stillman, perhaps you can answer

the question that your co-counsel and I are uncertain about, and
that is:

Do these pension payments comes in the form of a

government check and, if so, is the government paying out
money that was previously paid to it by Santa Fe?
MRS. STILLMAN:
from the U. S. Treasury.

Your Honor, it comes out in the form
The — under the Railroad Tax Act,

the railroads are taxed, the individuals are taxed, and the
money gees into the Railroad Retirement account so that the
railroads' tax funds are mingled in that account.

This man's

benefits from the Santa Fe, so to speak, are not segregated
in the account.

The different railroads just pay into the

fund at a certain tax rate.
I might say you were asking —
QUESTION:

Employees do too?

MRS. STILLMAN:

And employees do too, although after

the '74 Act, employees only pay the amount on their earnings
that they would pay under Social Security.

That is all they

pay.
The so-called Tier 2 benefit, which is the staff

21
pension on top of this basic Social Security benefit, this is
paid entirely by railroad taxes.

And I might say that when

they wrote the '74 Act, because they had some transition
provisions to preserve for some long-time employees some
benefits that they were phasing out, and there was a cost of
that phase out, Congress decided to let the U. S. Treasury
take up that cost.
QUESTION:

And
Is the general scheme of the Act to make

it self-financing?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes, but in the sense that the —

but it is not a funded scheme.

So it is like Social Security

that it attempts to be self-financing, but basically present
workers are paying in funds that present retirees are receiving.
And there is no contribution of the worker that is segregated
there, that is his contribution in which he has equity, although
generally there are certain guarantees that eventual payouts
would equal the amount that he had paid in in Social Security
taxes to his survivors or whatever, if he has a current
connection with the railroad,
I would like to emphasise thoxigh that our case
does not really absolutely depend on the nature of this fund.
What we are really relying on here is expressed terms of the
Railroad Retirement Act; specifically, that the purpose of
the Act. originally and still is to protect these funds for
the worker and to determine that they go to the worker alone.

22

And we are also relying on the expressed terms
of Title 45, Section 231m, which is the anti-assignment clause.
QUESTION:

When you say to protect these funds for

the worker, do you think Congress really meant to cut that
deep into the social policy

of the states and that the state
%

policy was to say that if the worker was married — there was
a marital community — to exclude the wife from the benefit?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes.

We think Congress did cut this

deep here and if I could, I could address the particular terms
which I think show that intention, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
First, the annuity payments are not to be made sub­
ject to legal process under any circumstances whatsoever.
QUESTION:

Do you think that a divorce decree is

legal process for those: —
MRS. STILLMAN:

We think that to allow a spouse to

bring the worker's expected future annuity payments into the
divorce action for adjudication, which is what she is doing,
is in effect a subjectment of the legal process.

And we think

this is so whether the order that she seeks is to compel a
‘

•

-V

transfer of the equivalent portion of the present value or
in order to collect out of the funds — out of the payments
as they are later paid to her.
Second, we think that a court order —
QUESTION:

Mrs. Stillman, on that point, do you go

as far as the other counsel did and argue that the divorce

23

court may not even take into account in figuring out what would
be a fair spousal award, the fact that such a benefit will in
the future be available to the husband?
MRS. STILLMAN:

We think the court is precluded from

doing that by the anticipation clause and by this legal process
clause.
QUESTION:

Does this record show the value of this —

the annuity value of this as of the time —
MRS. STILLMAN:
it.

I do not believe the record shows

It would be rather high because —
QUESTION:

I should think so.

MRS. STILLMAN:

— he is two years away from retire­

ment — two or three years away from retirement.
QUESTION:
large sum of money.

That kind of an annuity would cost a very
What would his payments be?

MRS. STILLMAN:

It would greatly exceed the equity.

I believe the equity in the house was approximately $12,500
total, and I am sure that it would be very difficult to take
a proportional value of that pension out of that.
QUESTION:

What is the amount that he is going to

receive?
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Per month?

MRS. STILLMAN:
Honor

The amount that he will receive?

I know that outside the record, Your

24
QUESTION:

Well, we are outside the z'ecord for the

moment since it is only a hypothetical.
MRS. STILLMAN:

Tell me.

I believe it is something in excess

of $700 a month.
QUESTION: And that would cost for a man of age 60
close to $100,000 to buy that as a single premium annuity?
MRS. STILLMAN:

It would be very high and there is

the relationship between that and the equity that is available
on the —
QUESTION:

So you say the courts of California may

not even take it into account when they divide it?
MRS. STILLMAN:

No, Your Honor, we think that what

they propose to do is to use that amount in a paper transaction
here to offset other value in the community.

We think that

that is using it, that that is anticipating it, as it fits fair.
QUESTION:

But your friend whose argument you are

supporting said that they could have done this by way of
alimony?
MRS. STILLMAN:

That is true.

And the reason they

could do this by way of alimony, we think this would be true
only since 1975 because in 1975 Congress by enacting in the
Social Security Act, Section 459, which is an override provision
that overrides the anti-attachment clauses such as this, said
that there could be garnishment of such funds for alimony and
child support.

We think that is an -—

25
QUESTION;

So that when the amount of alimony is

set by the judge —
MRS. STILLMAN;
QUESTION;

That is right.

— he — let us assume that the man was

going to have no income whatsoever except his annuity -—
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION;

Correct.

— and it is $700 a month, the court could

say, well, you are going to be getting $700 a month, you can
afford to pay so much for alimony?
MRS. STILLMAN;
QUESTION:

Yes.

MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

I think they can do that since 1975 —

— because there is now a correct -—

But to the extent that you can garnish

it, he could take it into account?
MRS., STILLMAN:

Certainly? yes.

And that is a

sensible reflection of the policy which Congress has now.

I

think probably they enacted — it is a reasonable assumption
that they enacted that statute in 1975 to avoid the harsh
results that would otherwise —
QUESTION:

But the statute also negatives the use

of it for other purposes.
MRS. STILLMAN:

It certainly does, because in 1977

they revised the — they did not revise? they clarified the
definition of alimony in the Social Security Act and expressly
excluded community property settlements of the type of order

26

that would result in this divorce proceeding»
QUESTION:

Well, did that by its terms apply to

Railroad Retirement benefits?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, that definition applies to

this override provision which by its terms does apply to
benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act, yes.

It applied —

it overrode a number of Federal -- military pay, a number of
them.

It was a provision affecting any number of Federal

benefits.
QUESTION:

And was community property singled out?

Is there any reason for it?
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

Why was community property singled out

for special treatment in the last act?
MRS. STILLMAN:
Your Honor.

Well, that is a matter for Congress,

It is a judgment that they are entitled to make,

QUESTION:

There is no other reason in the history?

MRS. STILLMAN:

I cannot say, Your Honor, why exactly

they decided to stop at alimony and child support, although
I think a reasonable view would be that, when you are dealing
with alimony and child support, you are dealing with actual
need.

And Congress is doing a balancing here.

There is a

protection —
QUESTION:

When you separate community property, you

are dealing with need too, are you not?

27

MRS . STILLMAN:
QUESTION;

Well, not necessarily, no»

If —

Well, in this case this woman needs

something»
MRS, STILLMAN;

It is not established that she needs

it.
QUESTION:

Well, does she not?

MRS. STILLMAN:

She has her own earnings»

She works

and she will have Social Security benefits.
And I might say, just on that point — I would like
to make this clarification for the record — the amicus brief
now and the respondent both said that she would be — that the
petitioner would be entitled to take his entire Railroad Retire
ment benefit and then claim a divorce spouse’s benefit, based
on her earnings under the Social Security Act.
We think that would — it would be ill-advised of
him to try that because if gets an award of —- a benefit under
the Social Security Act, there is an offset provision in the
Railroad Retirement Act which would require that his railroad
benefit be reduced to the amount that he was -QUESTION:

Well, Mrs. Stillman, I do not think the

need or anything else is involved in this.

I think the same

statute applies to a movie actor as it applies to a laborer.
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

Is that not right?

MRS. STILLMAN:

Although movie actors would not be

28
covered by this Act, but we would just say that Congress has
a policy here that they have made an inroad into this protectior,
that they have established for these payments.

And they have

only gone so far as making it for alimony and child support .
They have not gone further to extend it to community property
settlements„
We would say or call to the Court's attention also
that H, R„ 8771, which was described in our brief at page 23
and has now been enacted as Public Law 95-366, in the Civil
Service Retirement and Disability Program Congress has now
gone further for that program and done essentially what the
respondent wants the Court to allow to have done by application
of State law to this statute.
QUESTION:

Does not 659 though just refer to garnish­

ment?
MRS. STILLMAN:

No, this is something else, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

I do not mean the section you immediately

jtist cited* but —
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— 659 which is, as I understand it, the

'75 amendment.
MRS. STILLMAN:

Refers only to garnishment, but we

think that a reasonable interpretation of the Act in the light
of that now is that it would be acceptable to consider alimony

29

since it can be garnished.
QUESTION;

Well, but then it is not entirely accurate

to say that the '75 Act by its terms applies to the treatment
of community property, is it, in railroad retirement —
MRS. STILLMAN;

Oh, but the ’75 Act was, as I said,

clarified by a re-definition of alimony in 1977, which applies
specifically to the term alimony in that statute.

And they

defined alimony to exclude community property because there
had been some uncertainty on the parts of some of the courts „
QUESTION:

And you are still talking about it under

the umbrella of alimony, are you not

or rather of garnish­

ment, are you not?
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:
not garnishment,

That is true, Your Honor.

And if the award of community property is

then that statute, I take it, would not

apply?
MRS. STILLMAN:

That is true, but we think that

there still could be no anticipation.

Are you talking now about

taking into account —
QUESTION:

Well, that is a different argument, is it

not?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

We would say simply that Congress has these other
options, and the option that they chose in this recent retire­
ment — Civil Service Retirement Program was to allow

30

garnishment out of Civil Service pensions for community property
awards, as well as divorce and as alimony judgments»
Now, Congress may wish to extend that to this Act»
It might — there might be good policy reasons for them to
do it, but we simply think that that is a matter for Congress
to decide and not a matter that should be engrafted onto the
statute by State law.
We think that the court recognised that in the
case of Free v. Bland when it said:

"The relative importance

to the State of its own law is not material when there is a
conflict with a valid federal law, for the Framers of our
Constitution provided that the federal law must prevail»"
Therefore, we submit — the United States submits
that the judgment of the Supreme Court of California should
be reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Fields?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD M. FIELDS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FIELDS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please
\

the court:
The issue in this case is simply as Mr. Justice
Rehnquist has stated:

whether the California courts in applying

California family law doctrines relating to community property
may include in the total amount of assets acquired during the
marriage but prior to separation the present value of the

31

petitioner's Railroad Retirement benefits to the extent that
they are attributable to employment during the marriage»
The issue is not one of a contractual interest and,
indeed, the United States acknowledges on page 7 of its
brief that that issue is irrelevant to the case before the
Court.
QUESTION;

Under the Railroad Retirement Act, what

happens if this man dies before he reaches age 60?
MR. FIELDS;

Well, at this point, Mr. Chief Justice,

the respondent would be entitled to nothing.

She would not

be entitled to the survivor's benefit and she —•
QUESTION;

Well, what happens to the money?

We know

they are divorced.
MR. FIELDS:

It remains in the fund — the trust

fund.
QUESTION:

It is forfeited — it is escheated to the

fund, in other words?
MR. FIELDS;
QUESTION:

Exactly.
But if they had remained married, she

would have received part of it?
MR, FIELDS:

She would receive a survivor's benefit;

she would not receive a spouse benefit.
QUESTION:

In other words, it is a joint in survivor­

ship annuity in effect?
MR. FIELDS:

Yes.

If on remand and the decision of the Supreme Court

32

is affirmed, the petitioner — the respondent will not be
claiming a 50 percent interest in petitioner’s benefits„

She

would be entitled only to 50 percent of the community property
interest, that being the amount which is attributable to
employment during the marriage.

That amount in this case would

be less than 20 percent as it respects respondent.
As is pointed out by the respondent’s brief, the
court is not required to give respondent 50 percent or even
20 percent of the benefits to respondent as they are received
by the petitioner because the court can award an alternative
item of coirmunity property or can award to the spouse a portion
of the Railroad Retirement benefits after they are received.
In answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question earlier,
in the case as to whether or not the funds could be garnished
or executed upon, once the funds are in the bank account —
at least, one court, the Superior Court in Pennsylvania in
Commonwealth versus Berfield, cited in the respondent’s — in
the amicus brief filed by the National Organisation for Women,
shows that in that case the court decided that the funds could
be garnished once those funds were in the hands of the peti­
tioner or in that case as they were in the hands of the bank.
QUESTION;

Generally speaking, California’s domestic

relations law and how it is administered is none of our
business, but tell me whether the California courts still have
jurisdiction to grant alimony in this case or to reexamine

33

this case, depending on the outcome — to reexamine the
case in California, depending on the outcome of this appeal?
MR. FIELDS:

In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, for

reasons unknown to me, that the attorney who tried the case
did waive spousal supp ort and I believe that on remand the
respondent would not be entitled to claim any more spousal
support.
You correctly stated, technically the issue of
family law doctrines, as they are applied in California, is
really not an issue in this Court.

It is not something to be

determined by this Court.
This Court stated in United States versus Yazell
that both the theory and the precedents of this Court, teach
4>

us solicitude for state interest.

Particularly in the field

of family and property arrangements, they should be overridden
by Federal courts only where clearance, substantial interest
of the national government, which cannot be served consistentlywith respect for such interest, will suffer major damage if
the State law is applied.
We submit that Congress has not acted clearly in
declaring that State law should be preempted and that there
is no interest of the national government which will suffer
major damage if the State law is applied.
In Wissner versus Wissner there was a clear intent
of the national government in protecting the morale of the

34

servicemen in making life insurance available to them at a
reasonable cost.

This was —

QUESTION;

How could you read this statute that would

allow us to do that?
MR. FIELDS:
QUESTION;

Excuse me, Mr. Justice Marshall?
Kow would you read this statute that says

you just cannot do this and say, yes, you may do it?
MR. FIELDS:

I do not believe there is a statute

saying that California cannot do this.

We submit that neither

231n or 231d clearly states that California cannot do what
California has done in this case.
QUESTION:

Wesll, that is what I am \*aiting for you

to explain it and do more than just say so.
MR. FIELDS:

With regard to the issue of anticipation,

anticipation is really a word of art.

We submit that 231m,

the exemption from execution statute, was merely an exemption
from execution statute which has to be read in light of the
circumstances under which the Act x*as passed.

This was in

1935 and the —
QUESTION:

Well, what do you think anticipation

means?
MR. FIELDS:
spendthrift trusts.

It is a word of art taken out of
If you read that just the way that

petitioner believes it should be read, you can also argue
that the respondent is anticipating that the husband will

35

receive these benefits, bat the husband himself is anticipating
that he too will receive these benefits at some time in the
future.

By the petitioner's own reading of that statute, this

Court has to conclude, we believe, that the petitioner himself
cannot anticipate those benefits.
It is merely a word of art.
QUESTION;
art.

Yes, but the statute is not a word of

The statute says you cannot collect.
MR. FIELDS;

cannot collect.

No.

The statute does not say the wife

QUESTION;
MR. FIELDS:

Well, why was the statute amended in '75?
The *75 amendment merely states — are

you talking about —
QUESTION:
MR. FIELDS:

Surplusage.
We do not believe that the '75 amendment

was directed to the wife, who we believe to be —
QUESTION:
MR. FIELDS:

Well, how about the '77?
The ‘77 amendment regarding garnishment

esqpressly — it does not recognize a community interest, but
you have to look in light of the purpose of the enactment of
that legislation.
Congress was trying to combat welfare recipient
increases — increases in the rate of the welfare roles because
husbands were —■ and feithers were able to avoid their support
obligations

36

And under the '77 amendment, Congress determined that
it would waive the sovereign immunity in order to permit the
states to have the recipient of welfare benefits assigned those
benefits.
QUESTIONS

It did not raise it out of the community

property, did it?
MR» FIELDS:
QUESTIONs
MR, FIELDS;
QUESTION:
did you not?

No, it did not.

There is really no —■

It could have, but it did not»
It could have, Justice Marshall, but —
But you recognize that it did prohibit.,

You never recognized that it does prohibit it?

MR» FIELDS:

It prohibits garnishment of the

Retirement Funds by the? respondent, but that statute does not
prohibit —
QUESTION:

No.

My question was that it did not

take out community property.

So they left it in and you

mistakenly said that is right, but you did not really mean to
say that.
MR. FIELDS:

I meant to — we submit, Mr. Justice

Marshall, that Congress was only addressing that one problem,
that problem of fathers and husbands evading their support
obligations rather than their community property obligations.
There is absolutely no history in the legislature
that Congress intended to prohibit wives from obtaining any
type of benefit —-

37

QUESTION:

Except they said no legal proceeding.

MR. FIELDS:

Well, legal proceeding is also, we

contend, a word of art.
QUESTION;
MR. FIELDS;

It has certain exceptions like divorce.
Yes, but the mere adding up of an

asset in a community -QUESTION;

Well, if divorce is not a legal proceeding,

why do you lawyers charge fees?

I mean take a simple way of

looking at it.
MR. FIELDS;

Well, the divorce is a legal proceeding,

but the aspect of adding up this benefit as a community
property asset is really not a legal process per se.
QUESTION:

Could I just follow up on one thought.

Mr. Justice Marshall asked you what in your view the word
"anticipated” meant, and I did not understand your answer.
MR. FIELDS:

My answer was that, again, this was

a word included in an exemption statute, enacted, during the
Depression.

It was, we believe, taken out of context, out

of the language of the spendthrift trust.

And if we follow

through on petitioner’s argument that the court cannot evaluate
the community interest in this benefit because the respondent
vrould be anticipating that benefit, it must also be concluded
that the petitioner himself is anticipating that benefit.
QUESTION:

Well, but that may be a reason why their

interpretation — I am asking you what your interpretation of

38

the word is.

Do you have -- or do you think it is just

redundant?
MR. FIELDS:

I believe that it is redundant; that it

was inserted in there by someone who was drafting that
particular —
QUESTION :

You do not think it means anything more

than the preceding clause which refers to a garnishment
attachment and other legal process?
MR. FIELDS:

No.

I personally do not believe it

means anything more than that.

And there is no history,

especially as indicated in the hearing — the 1935 hearing
report cited in our brief, that Congress intended by that
statute to preempt —
QUESTION:

Well, your answer is it is totally

redundant?
MR. FIELDS:

It is totally redundant.

There is no

intent that Congress intended to preempt State family law
concepts„
QUESTION:

Would it possibly also be speculative

since Mrs. Stillman said that if he died before reaching age
60, the whole fund is wiped out?

That is, there is no fund;

there is no asset anymore.
MR. FIELDS:
Justice.

Well, that is correct, Mr. Chief

If he dies before age 60, the amount of his con­

tributions to the fund would be forfeited.

39

QUESTIONs

Well, the redundancy, if there is one,

is really between the prohibition against anticipation and the
statutory requirement for benefits, service, time and so forth,
rather than the statutory prohibition against anticipation
and the statutory prohibition against garnishment, is it not?
MR» FIELDS:

Yes, we believe so»

As is brought out in the respondent's brief and
in the two amici briefs filed on her behalf, this Court does
not under established law presume an intent where no intent
exists„

*
There is no indication anywhere in the legislative

history thoroughly discussed in the briefs that Congress
intended to preempt State community property law»
The existence of the spouse's benefit cited by the
petitioner in his brief does not imply that Congress intended
to preempt state community property law.

The mere existence

of that spouse's benefit is an interesting question in itself.
We believe that it was enacted in 1951 in response to the
demands of the railroaders, who had traditionally been receiving
an amount of benefits far in excess of Social Security.
By 1950, however, Congress had amended the Social
Security Act so that there was an average benefit increase
of 77 percent.

At this point, the railroaders who had been —

who were receiving less than Social Security recipients and
the railroads themselves, which were upset that they were

40

contributing greater amounts of money into the Railroad Retire­
ment Fund than Social Security recipients, employers would be
contributing, that greater benefits were in order.
We believe that the existence of the spouse's benefit
was merely an explanation for Congress' intent to provide
greater benefits in order to make the Railroad Retirement
recipients receiving more than Social Security recipients.
The fact that the spouse's benefit terminates upon
divorce merely supplements Section 231d, because at the
conclusion of the marriage there is no spouse.

The spouse

receives a separate benefit, separate and apart from her hus­
band.
She receives a separate check.

This could be a good

explanation for why the court — why the Congress determined
that the spouse's benefit terminates upon divorce.

Congress

did not determine that the spouse is not — is precluded under
the Supremacy Clause from establishing any community property
interests in husband's right to receive Federal Railroad
Retirement benefits.
To conclude that Congress by enacting House Bill
8771 in which — which was signed by President Carter on
September 15th and enacted as Public Law 95-366, it recognizes
that Congress can, in effect, affirm the California Supreme
Court decision in this case.

It is merely in support of

respondent's argument that what California is doing does not

41
conflict Congressional intent,

8771 was enacted in order -—

in recognition of — by Congress of the greater needs that
are present in today's society by older divorced women.

Congress

is receptive to this point of older divorced women.
QUESTIONs

But that legislation, if I have it

identified correctly, is specifically applicable only to
Civil Service retirees, is it not?
MR, FIELDSs

Yes.

Yes, Mr, Justice Stewart; that

is correct,
QUESTION;

You just meant it illustrates that

Congress could do this if it wanted to?
MR. FIELDS;

Yes.

But as pointed out by the brief filed on behalf
of members of Congress, one of the objections posed during
a period in which Congress was considering this piece of legis­
lation was that community property and state domestic relations
law is really an area of state concern, not an area of
Federal concern.
In the area of family law, this Court frequently
defers to state law in that regard.

It is simply not a Federal

_it is not an area of Federal involvement.

To accept the

respondent's argument as further advanced by the United States,
which I might add was contradicted this morning by Mrs.
Stillman, the point that the California court cannot take
into account alimony, this is contradicted on pages 22 and 23

42
of the brief filed on behalf of the United States, in which
the United States is really advancing the argument that the
Federal government should somehow get involved in needs of the
divorce spouse’s -—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

MRS. STILLMAN:

\

MR. CHIEF JO TICE BURGER:

Very well.

Then, Mrs.

Kay, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERMA HILL KAY, ESQ.
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MRS. KAY;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the court:
As Mr. Fields said to the court this morning, the
only issue before this court in this case is whether California
may list under the heading of community assets arising from
this marriage the present value of Mr. Hisquierdo's right to
receive in the future benefits attributable to his work during
the marriage and payable from the Railroad Retirement Act.
QUESTION:

In your view, if the judge simply said,

perhaps to himself first, "I am going to take into account that
there is about $100,000 asset here, contingent upon the man's
surviving", take it into account, not anticipated in the sense

43

that word is used as a word of art, would you think that he
could properly do that?
MRS „ KAY;

Yes, Your Honor.

That is exactly what the

California Supreme Court said could be done in pension cases
and in re marriage ground, where the court said that we no
longer had to wait for pension rights to vest.

It was enough

if there was a right attributable to work performed during
the marriage could be taken into account.
QUESTION;

But then, what if the gentleman died,

either a week before or a year after?
MRS. KAY:

Well, Your Honor, if the gentleman died —

QUESTION:

After it vested — after it vested?

MRS. KAY:

If the gentleman dies or, indeed, in a

private pension case if he leaves employment and is no longer
entitled under the private plan to any benefits, then the
court has to retain jurisdiction on the theory that there is
insufficient evidence on which to value the plan.

And the court

can do that and does do it quite commonly.
QUESTION:

You mean, the continuing jurisdiction of

the domestic —
MRS. KAY:

Of the divorce court; that is correct,

Your Honor, so that as and when the benefits become payable,
the court will then know exactly what can be allocated to
each spouse.

So that if, for example, in this case it were

difficult to value Mr. Hisquierdo's rights in the Railroad

44
Retirement benefits, the court could retain jurisdiction until
1981 when he is scheduled to retire — could then award the
wife, as Mr. Fields said, 20 percent of the share of the bene­
fits, and could order Mr, Hisquierdo to pay them.
Mow I would like to add that that is not to say that
•

t

the court could order the Railroad Retirement Board to pay them.
It is not even to say that you could attach those benefits in
Mr, Hisquierdo's hands.

It is merely to say the court could

make an order to Mr. Hisquierdo that this amount be paid to
his wife.
That is commonly done, Your Honor, and indeed has
been done, contrary to the argument that Mrs. Stillman made
this morning in cases arising under the predecessor to Section
231m, namely, Section 231-1 to the Railroad Retirement Act,
where in several cases the courts took into account the value
of the Railroad Retirement benefits in both alimony and child
support situations, and said that those benefits can be payable
even though the specific benefits may not be payable, an order
can be entered against —
QUESTION;

Well, but this does not involve alimony

or child support,
MRS, KAY;

That is correct, Your Honor? it does not,

QUESTION;

It involves whether or not California

can consider this community property.
issue, is it not?

And that is the only

45
MRS„ KAY:

I absolutely agree with you. Your Honor.

I think the 1974 amendment, the 1975 amendment and *77 defi­
nitional amendment are totally irrelevant to the question of
Congressional intent in this case.
We are not relying on any need on the part of the
wife.

We are relying on her rights as an owner of this

property.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTIONs

Mrs. Kay, is another way of stating this,

you say the question is whether this —- the present value of
the pension could be listed as a community asset.

Could it

also be correct to say that the issue is whether,when that
present value is listed, shall it be listed as a husband asset
or as a joint asset?

Is not that another way of stating the

same insue?
MRS. KAY:
Your Honor.

Well, not under Californici practice,

It is true that when you file in the California

court for dissolution of marriage, you have two separate forms.
The petitioner lists the community assets from marriage.

They

are not usually listed as husband's assets or wife's assets;
they are simply listed as community assets.
So in this case, as indeed happened in this very
proceeding, the wife would list under community assets husband's
Railroad Retirement benefits.

That does not mean that they

belong to the husband and not to the wife.

It means that they

46

have been attributed to his labor during the marriage.
QUESTION

No.

But would it not be your view that

if the government is correct here — and, of course, that has
not been decided — that all that would mean would be that
this particular asset would be treated in the total picture
as an asset belonging to the husband?

It could still be taken

into account by the judge in making whatever alimony or support
or —
MRS. KAY:

No, Your Honor.

It would not be treated

as an asset belonging to the husband.

It would be treated, if

you please, as an asset generated by the husband’s work during
marriage.
QUESTION:

Well, if it is community property?

MRS. KAY:

That is correct if it is community

QUESTION:

As Mr. Justice Stevens said, if the

property.

government is correct in this case, then it is the husband's
asset and it is not community property.
MRS. KAY:

Oh, I bag your pardon, Your Honor.

If

the government is correct, then it is not a community asset
at all.

The government has corrected as separate property,

and separate property is not subject to division upon dissolu­
tion under California law, so would not be listed at all.
QUESTION:

Is it not •—• may not -- maybe I am just

terribly ignorant about California law — it would mean that

47
the California judge could not even taken into consideration
the separate property in deciding what —
MRS. KAY:

That is correct. The trial court judge

could take into account separate property only for the purpose
of establishing an alimony award —
QUESTION:

But he could do that?

MRS. KAY:

— not for the purpose of dividing

the community property.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand.

But he could do that?

MRS o KAY:

Yes, he could do that.

QUESTION:

Because I think your opponent said he

could not, and I just wanted —■
MRS. KAY:

No, I do not •— I did not understand

my opponent to say that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, I guess I did misunderstand and

that is why I am trying to get help.
MRS. KAY:

I think one fundamental point that has

been overlooked here — the Chief Justice put a stinger on it
early this morning by asking why it made a difference whether
the defendant spouse took this property as community property
or as an alimony award.

The difference it makes is that

alimony awards are traditionally modifiable, can be terminated.
Alimony rights are subject to the discretion of the
trial court.

Community property rights are not.

So that there

is a great deal more security involved for the defendant spouse

48

under the community property laws in being able to

say this

asset is property right and not simply an alimony award.
QUESTION %

Alimony awards are also taxable generally,

MRS. KAY:

I beg your pardon?

QUESTION:

Are not alimony awards generally taxable

I believe.

to the recipient?
MRS. KAY:

They are generally taxable to the

recipient; that is correct. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But now, if you are correct and if this

property, the present value of the expectancy, is therefore
properly includable as property of the community, and there
is a division of that property, half and half on the dissolution
of the marriage, then what happens if two weeks after the
husband becomes eligible for the retirement benefits, he dies?
MRS. KAY:

Well, Your Honor, that is the question

of vacation.
QUESTION:

Well, it is, but now we are talking about

the present value, which —
MRS. KAY:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

— is, let us say, $20,000 or 40 and that

is divided in half.

And the wife on the dissolution of the

marriage, therefore, gets half of that, $.10,000 or whatever
it is; then a weak after the husband becomes eligible —- he

MRS. KAY:

No, Your Honor, in the case that you

pose, the cause of the uncertainty of his living until the
pension —
QUESTION:

But he has lived.

In my hypothesis he

has lived that long.
MRS. KAY:

What I am saying is that the trial court,

who has acted presumably before the husband has lived to the
time of your hypothetical —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MRS. KAY:

—- the trial court,realizing that the

husband might die, could and very likely would simply not order
the payment to the wife at the time of dissolution of $10,000,
but would retain jurisdiction, and would then simply begin
ordering the husband to pay to the wife as and when the benefits
become due, 20 percent of each monthly payment.

So that when

he died, since the Fund would then, as you said this morning,
revert to the Treasury, there being no children involved in
this case, then the wife would have nothing further against
what she could assert a community interest.
QUESTION:

But if you are correct, the judge would

not have to do that.

QUESTION:

Well, there again as a practical matter,

out „

and it is beyond our jurisdiction, it is a matter for California

51
As a practical matter, certainly the judge would not
be unaware, and if he was, some of the counsel would make him
aware of the fact that this was a highly speculative asset —
MRS. KAY:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

-- and he would hardly ascribe any fixed

value to it.

But does that not also suggest -- and again, this

is not our business — that the Railroad Retirement pension
or any other similar pension is the subject to be dealt with
under alimony, not under community property?
MRS. KAY:

Well, Your Honor, I do not think so.

As

people spend more of their working time accumulating benefits
towards retirement, and especially as you talk about families
4

where there is only one spouse working outside the home, towards
the end of the lengthy marriage, it is very likely that the
rights in the pension or the future expectati>ns in the pension
will be the single largest item of community property.
And if one takes account of that as alimony, as the
California Supreme Court said in the Phillipson case, it really
leaves the dependent spouse to the mercy of the divorce court
and not to the dignity of the community property award.
QUESTION:
^

Is it not true, Mrs. Kay, that California

for a long time has treated insurance annuities paid by private
insurance companies as community property rather than alimony?
MRS. KAY:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And we also

treat goodwill attributable to legal practice as community

52
property even though it cannot be sold by the lawyer.
Now it may be worth emphasizing what the issues are
in this case, now that I think we have discussed what the issues
are not.

The issue in this case is whether the United States

Congress in enacting the Railroad Retirement Act has indicated
in clear and direct tertos an intent to supersede state law.
The only two sections of the Railroad Retirement
Act that are relied on either by the petitioner or by the
government in expressing that clear intent are the anti-assign­
ment provisions of Section 231m and the termination of the
spousal benefit in the Railroad Retirement Act itself.
The anti-assignment provision has been mentioned
earlier this morning.

We believe that that provision, borrowed

language from spendthrift trust ideas, it was meant to protect
the worker against his own failure to provide for himself.

It

was to protect the worker against the claims of creditors.

Under

California law the Supreme Court has made it clear that the
wife claiming as an owner does not claim as a predator, and
that there is no anticipation or assignment involved in awarding
to her property that is her own.
While it is true that there is a Federal question
that this Court must decide as to whether that rule has been
superseded, I do not believe anyone has suggested that there
is a different definition of the legal terms, "assignment" or
"anticipation" for the purpose of Federal law and state law.

53
Therefore, in this Court’s long-standing practice of
refusing to interfere with the state domestic relations law
and in refraining from promulgating a Federal law of domestic
relations, this Court ought to leave the content of that
definition to state law.
There have been a series of cases in which the Court
has looked at the question of Federal preemption of state
community property laws.

Those cases are cited in all the

briefs in this case.
QUESTION:

But the government says this is not a

preemption case.
MRS. KAY %

Your Honor, I do not understand the

government to say it is not a preemption case.
QUESTION;

I heard the government say that this morning,

standing right where you are.
MRS. KAY:

Yes.

They rely on their brief on the

Wissner case which is a preemption case.
The Wissner case involved the National Service
Life Insurance policy, which was a policy of formal property
that was created by Congress for the benefit of —
QUESTION:

Well, I understand the government’s

position to be that there is a specific statute that does not
say preemption or anything else.

It merely says that this

money that comes from the Retirement Board shall not be used
for these purposes.

And that is not preemption anyway.

That

54
just says a prohibition.
MRS. KAY;

Well, Justice Marshall, the only two

provisions the Railroad Retirement Act, that they rely on to
say that, are the anti-assignment provision and the failure
to provide a benefit for divorced spouses.

And neither of

those two provisions, we submit, has anywhere near the clear
Congressional intent as the language used in the Wissner case,
where Congress said "this beneficiary and no other shall get
the proceeds."
QUESTION:

Well, does this apply —

MRS. KAY;

I beg your pardon?

QUESTION;

Do these provisions apply to all divorce

actions all over the country?
MRS. KAY;

Does what apply?

QUESTION;

Or is it limited to community property?

MRS. KAY;

I am sorry, I did not hear you.

QUESTION;

Well, does the decision in this case apply

to all 50 states or not?
MRS. KAY;

No, Your Honor, it will apply only to the

eight community property states --

i

QUESTION;

Why?

MRS. KAY;

— because only in the eight community

property states is the wife treated as a co-owner of property
as and when it is acquired.
And moreover, it may not apply in those community

55
property states that have not yet arrived at the position that
California has come to In Marriage of Brown, and has not yet
decided that it will award pension rights unless they are
vested.,
QUESTIONS

So it would apply to a maximum of eight,

but most certainly not all eight?
MRS, KAY:

That is correct, Your Honor,

Now the cases that this Court has decided earlier,
dealing with the question of preemption, began with the case
of Wissner versus Wissner and, as I indicated, the Court had
made vssry clear in that case that there was only one bene­
ficiary of the policy, and the beneficiary was the person
selected by the serviceman, and that beneficiary and no other
would be allowed to have the proceeds of the policy.
There is nothing like any such statement in the
Railroad Retirement Act, which is before the Court today.
QUESTION:

Well, there is nothing speculative about

the value of a life insurance policy, is there?

It has a cash

value on any given day and, upon death while the policy is
still enforced, it has a face value measurable.
But how would you advise a judge to place a value
)

on this retirement annuity?
MRS. KAY:

Well, Your Honor, the question of how

this retirement annuity is valued, I submit, is not before
the Court

56

QUESTION:

No, I know it is not, but there are some

practical aspects to this case which we have all been exploring,
and they are very important to the ultimate resolution of the
problem perhaps.
So how would you tell the judge if he said,

"Now

will you, counsel, tell us how to value this" --- there being
no survivorship rights here?
MRS. KAY:

Yes.

Well, Your Honor, in California

practice a great amount of money, I understand, is spent on
actuarial consultants who attempt to place a value on these
intangible property rights and —
QUESTION:

But how do you do that on an annuity which

will terminate on the instant of the death of this man?
MRS. KAY:

Well, you look, for example, at mortality

tables indicating hov; long he is likely to live.
QUESTION:

Well, but what if he steps off of the

curb and get hits by a truck, the mortality table is not going
to help.
MRS. KAY:

That is right, but actuaries, I understand,

are able to take account of factors of that kind and, at any
event, the California courts are saved by the fact that if
the actuarial figures are not sufficient in the discretion
of the court to make an immediate award, all the court need do
is retain jurisdiction.
So that provides a very practical back-up which the

57
court can fall back on.
In this case, the court would only have to wait
until 1981 to find out whether Mr. Hisquierdo gets hit by a
car as he steps off the curb.
QUESTIONS

Do your California courts face similar

problems in valuing purely private pension rights?
MRS. KAY;

Absolutely, Your Honor, and that was

one of the major arguments In Marriage of Brown against the
position that the court took.
And it was because the court felt that it had to
carry cmt the strong State law policy of preserving the

^

community property interest as against the more speculative
^

alimony award that the court decided that it was necessary
to define community property interests in that case.
So we do know how difficult it is to value these
kinds of things in California, but nevertheless the courts
are facing this problem as a practical matter everyday.
Now, in the case following Wissner, which also
involved the question of Federal preemption in the case of
Free versus Bland, there was again an effort to borrow money
on the Federal credit, and in that case this Court decided

>

that the husband in a community property state buying co-owner
bonds with his wife with the right of survivorship were allowed
to overcome the contrary Tessas rule, which would have said that
the spouses could not agree in effect to convert what was

58

community property into survivorship property that would belong
to the owner.
The court overcame the contrary state law interest
in that case because of the necessity to raise money
public credit.

in the

But in a case following Free versus Bland,

written by Mr. Justice White, Yiatchos against Ylatchos. the
Court refused to permit that prior holding in Free against
Bland to be used by a husband in the State of Washington to
defraud his wife of her community property interests.
In that case, the husband had invested something
like $15,000 worth of community funds as to which he was the
sole manager and bonds naming his brother as a survivor.

And

after his death, the wife in effect said, "My community property
rights have been taken away by the conjunction of this Court's
holding him free and the husband's managerial rights under
State law."
And this Court said we will not allow the Federal
provisions here to be used as an instrument of fraud to take
away the wife's rights.

The Court used a Federal definition

of fraud, but in looking to the content of the wife's rights,
it looked to State law to define her property rights.
So that it did admit that even in a case where pre­
emption was otherwise clear, the wife's rights under State
community property law would be preserved.
QUESTIONs

But did not that case say quote:

"The

59

survivorship provision

is

a Federal law which must prevail

if it conflicts with State law"?
MRS» KAY;

Yes, Your Honor, but the Court also —

QUESTION;

The very language they used.

MRS. KAY;

But the Court also said that it would

seem obvious that the bonds may not be used as a device to
deprive the widow of property rights, which she enjoys under
Washington law and which would not be transferable by her
husband but for the survivorship provisions of the Federal
bonds„
So the Court was willing to admit in that case that
the strong Federal interest which it had found in Free against
Bland must itself give way to Federal doctrine

filled with the

content of State property law to prevent the wife from being
defrauded of her rights by an unscrupulous husband.
What I am suggesting is that this Court has even
in that context adhered to its long-standing practice of not
trying to write for the country a Federal domestic relations
law, but rather has conceded that State law should be followed
to the extent possible, were it not necessary to protect the
Federal interest.
The statement that was made —
QUESTION;

Mrs. Kay, let me interrupt just a second.

MRS. KAY s

I beg your pardon.

QUESTION;

You are saying that you are avoiding the

60

Congress writing a Federal domestic relations law.

But really

you are arguing that you do not want this property to be
subjeci; to any domestic relations law.

You want it to be

the dignity of the community property law, rather than the
mercy of the divorce court to be controlling, as I remember
your —
MRS. KAYs

Well, Your Honor, in California we speak

of community property law as domestic relations law.

Community

property exists only between persons who are legally married
to each other.

And in order to have that kind of property,

one has to enter into a valid marriage.
So that in its regulation of the rights between
husband and wife, California has established a community
property regime.

It has also permitted alimony awards to be

made to either spouse.

And indeed, the interdependence of

those two factors is very important because, depending on the
amount of coramisnifcy property awarded, the court may vary
the alimony award.
So that if, for example, in this case the wife is
awarded 20 percent of the Railroad Retirement benefits as
community property, the court will take that into account in
determining how much spousal support, if any, she should get.
And, of course, on the facts of this case, that is not the
point since the wife waived alimony, but if you take a different
case in which the wife did not waive alimony, the court would

61

take those two factors into account, and the amount of community
property received would go towards both diminishing her future
need for support and, in this case, since it comes out of the
husband's Railroad Retirement benefits, his ability to pay.
QUESTION:

Yes, but my brother Stevens' point is

that community property law is property law.

It is not

confined to divorce situations.
MRS. KAY;

But it is confined to married people,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Certainly, but it is applicable in terms

of inheritance and bequests and all sorts of other property
transactions and concepts.
)

And if you are correct, the

division of the community property is wholly unrelated to
need.

It would be true if both of these people were million­

aires .
MRS. KAY;

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

It is v/holly unrelated to need.

MRS. KAY;

That is correct.

I have never contended

anything else.
QUESTION;

And alimony, by contrast, has to do with

— or spousal support, as you call it in California, has to
j

do with need and ability to pay.
MRS. KAY;

That is right.

QUESTION;

And community property has nothing what­

soever do with either.

62

MRS. KAY2

That is correct, Your Honor.

But it still,

I submit, has to do with domestic relations law as it relates
to the property law —- the property rights of persons who
are married to each other.

And it is not, I submit, simply

a suggestion that, has nothing to do with that particular
kind of interaction, because the whole sweep of California
domestic relations law is based around the idea of community
property.
For example, I am sorry this case is not cited
in my brief, because I did not know you were going to make
this argument, but in deciding the case of Marvin versus
Marvin, which has attracted a great deal of publicity, the
California Supreme Court expressly refused to apply community
property concepts to persons living in non-marital cohabitation.
The court said we will enforce contracts, but they are not
married and, therefore, community property law does not
apply.
And I submit that that is the correct evaluation
of the policy underlying State law.
QUESTIONS

Community property really depends upon

the concept of the contribution of each of the partners to
the marriage, whereas alimony depends on the need of the
partners after the marriage is dissolved?
MRS. KAY:

That is absolutely right, Your Honor.

And it seems to me again that, therefore — that the point that

63

is made throughout the brief of the United States, namely, that
this Court might be willing to create exceptions if need could
be shovm, is really totally irrelevant to the argument that
we are making and is also, I think, totally irrelevant to the
question of Congressional intent to preempt? the fact that
an exception might be applied to exemption laws or to spend­
thrift laws and, indeed, even written in now to some of the
government benefit provisions has nothing to do with this case
at all.
QUESTION?

Well, I did not understand the government

to be saying in its brief what you understand it to be saying.
My perception of it was that the government simply conceded
that, of course, in determining whether and to what extent
and to what amount to grant an alimony award, a spousal support
award, the court may consider the ability to pay of the
husband.

And part of that ability to pay depends upon his

expectancy of a retirement.
MRS. KAYs

That is all it said.

That is right, Your Honor, but the

point I am making is that the government then throughout its
brief at four or five points contrasts what it refers to as
the mechanical division of property and the community property
laws with this need on the theory, I think, that it is better
to relegate the spouse to the alimony award rather than to
accord her the dignity of the property right.
What I am suggesting is —

QUESTION;

Well, maybe what the government says in

its brief lies in the eye of the beholder, but I did not —
I read it a little differently.
MRS. KAY;

Well, I hope upon reflection, Mr. Justice

Stewart, you have reason to read it differently again.
In conclusion, I would like to say that this case
does not involve a far-reaching principle.

It does not involve

an effort to interfere with what the government is trying
to do in the Railroad Retirement Act.
It merely simply refers to the right of a state
court in its domestic relations law to take account of the
equal contributions by both spouses to the marriage and their
right to rely upon the expectation of having that labor ful­
filled when the marriage is dissolved.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mrs. Kay.

You have a few minutes left, counsel.
REBUTTAL OF JAMES D. EliDMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ENDMAN;

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen of the Court;
I would again like to indicate to the Court that
an offset of other community property will be just as damaging
to the annuitant as taking of other part of the exact annuity.
I would also like to clarify one point, that even

though we use the word "annuity" here, we are not talking of
it the same as a life insurance type annuity»

We are talking

of Congressional acts -—
QUESTIONS

Simply because the statute does not apply

to life insurance annuity and it does apply here, is that it?
MR. ENDMAN:

No, I believe :Lt is more than that,

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTIONS
MR. ENDMAN:

What else?
What we have here is a situation iden­

tical to Social Security, that those

who are presently working

are paying a tax under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act that
goes into the government and then is appropriated to take care
of those who are presently retired.

There is no purchase

situation involved here as we would have in a life insurance
contract situation? that there is no contract involved here.
It is merely a welfare type program providing that those who
work are —
QUESTION:

Well, do you mean that a recipient —

the railroad retiree does not have a contractual right to
recover the payments?
MR. ENDMAN:

His rights, should he die prematurely,

would extend only to a Code section that provides that -QUESTION:

I am talking about during his lifetime»

Suppose they did not pay it?
could he not?

He could force the payment,

66

Well, under the — yes, he would have

MR» ENDMANs
the right to -—
QUESTIONS

Well, he would run into the decision of

Fleming against Nestor, would he not, if he tried that?
MR. ENDMAN:
to.

Yes.

That is what I was referring

As this Court stated in the Fleming case, I submit is

the exact same situation that we are dealing with in Railroad
Retirement? that they are part of that sane exact scheme.
QUESTIONs

It is a statutory entitlement until the

statuto is amended?
MR. ENDMAN:

Yes.

The Congress, with regard to Section 231m, if they
intended to limit the assignment provisions only to creditors,
could have provided, as they did in National Service Life
Insurance, that only creditors shall be prohibited from
garnishment attachment, ®t cetera.
But they did not put that word in.

They intended

to be much broader.
We simp3,y put

we submit that there is a conflict

between the Federal law and the community property laws? that
it is a physical impossibility within this scheme to give part
of the proceeds to the annuitant under the Code and then take
away part of it.

It is impossible to give him his entire

statutory due.
I would like to also indicate that it is ny

67

understanding that, even though Railroad Retirement will apply
to the eight community property states, 1 understand that there
are other states that have equal division requirements? as
an example, I believe Illinois — I was contacted by an attorney
-— has just passed 3uch a statute,
So this statute will extend beyond just the community
property states,
I think the effect of the statute will also apply
not only to Railroad Retirement, but because Social Security
is the same scheme? as goes Railroad Retirement, so will
probably Social Security, and there are some cases, I under­
stand, pending regarding pension plans under the ERISA Program,
whether they also too would be involved.
I would also like to point out that under the
Ylatchos case, referred by the amicus for NOW, that in that
case it involved the ability of the husband in that case
to take community funds, put them into savings bonds and thus
defraud his wife.
The Railroad retiree does not have that ability
to move around to his annuity funds or there can be no
frauds involved unless we were to say that by taking a rail­
road job, he is trying to deprive his wife of that railroad
annuity,
And thus, I cio not think that that Yiatchos case
applies to this situation.

68

QUESTION;

Well, I suppose the California courts

would say that he had worked on the railroad for 40 years
and had a pension, and she had worked at home raising kids
and keeping house for 40 years, that if he simply walks off
with a major asset that is accrued from his income during that
time, that is a form of fraud»
MR. ENDMAN;

I do not see that as being a fraud»

That is an accumulation of a property right.

And if it is

separate property, for instance, a case I recently had involved
a man who had inherited property, which was a substantial
portion of what these people had»

He had worked on that

property that he had inherited and tinder California law that
is separate property and the fact that he was worth probably
a millionaire — at least, he admitted to being a millionaire ~
had nothing to do with the fact that she got no part of it,
but it could be taken into —
QUESTION;

But the question is whether it is separate

property or not, is it not?
MR. ENDMAN:

Well, that would be up to the State

to decide whether —
QUESTION;
)

Yes.

And here the State has said it is

not separate property.
MR. ENDMAN;
community property.

Right.

The State has said it is

What we submit is because of the conflict

involved that even if it is community property, the State has

69

no right to touch it.
Any further questions?

I thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:34 p.m., the above-entitled case
was submitted.)
