MRa CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear first this

morning Nos» 77“753 and the consolidated case, International
Brotherhood of Teamsters against Daniel»
Mr» Carmeli, you may proceed whenever you're ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHERMAN CARMELL, ESOo,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 77-754
MR» CARMELLs

Mr» Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
In 1950 the respondent John Daniel began employment
under the jurisdiction, of Teamsters Local 705»

Five years

later, Local 705 negotiated a contract which provided, for the
first time, for a pension fund, which is the Local 705 Pension
Fund,
In addition to being structured in accordance with
Section 302(c) (5) of the Labor-Management Relations Act of
1947, the basic features of the Local 705 Pension Fund were
and are that it is a defined benefit plan, it is noncontributory,
it is mandatory»
Between December of 1960 and July of 1961, the Fund
records show no employment, covered employment, for Mr» Daniel»
In 1973, Mr» Daniel applied for a pension»

After two

hearings before the Boards of Trustees at which he appeared,
the Trustees denied his application for a pension based upon

5

the break in service between December of '60 and July of 1961
as not meeting the Farid's eligibility rule.
As a result, Mr, Daniel filed and then amended a six~
count complaint in the District Court» Two of the counts, the
first two which are before this Court, we;re posited upon the
Securities laws»
the LMRA, one

Two counts were based upon Section 302 of

count alleged a breach of the duty of fair

representation under Section 9(a) of the NLRA, and one count
was a pended jurisdiction claim for State common law fraud»
The local 705 petitioners moved to dismiss all of the
counts.

The District Court denied the motion to dismiss all

of the counts.

The case proceeded up on Counts I and II, the

Securities Act counts which are before this Court»
In this posture, may it please the Court, the case
does not involve the merits of the Local 705 Pension Fund
Service Rule.

And although the respondent, in a discussion of

ERISA at page 97 of .his brief before this Court, states?

"To

allow ERISA to preempt the antifraud provision of the Federal
Securities laws would be to deny Daniel any relief whatsoever*"
The respondent told the District Court, at Appendix
152a, that "Even if the security counts should be challenged
or reversed on appeal, 1 feel that the other counts would be
viable,"
The result of reversal in this case, then, would be

6

that the proceedings would continue in the District Court
under the two Section 302 counts, the breach of the duty of
fair representation and Stata law common fraud.
If it please the Court, I wish to direct my arguments
to the differences which may be found between the Securities
Act and the labor statutes in the area of labor relations.
The labor statutes, as I refer to them, are the
National Labor Relations Act, th® LMRA, the Welfare Pension
Plan Disclosure Act and ERISA.
And when using the tern "labor relations", may it
please the Court, I am not speaking only of union management
or collectively bargained plans, I am talking of the full
spectrum of employer-employee relations.

That is, those

pension plans which involve the relatiomship between an employes:
end an employee of which one is a collectively bargained pension
plan.
The cn© consensus, which I believe can ha found from
the mass of briefs among the courts, the parties and the amici,
is that the legislative history and the provisions of the
Securities Act do not mention pension plans aa such.
On the other hand
argument

and this is the point of our

the labor statutes, beginning in 1935 and

consistently through ERISA, have discussed, considered, made
discreet cohesive and sometimes vary detailed judgments as to
the types of disclosure, as to the rights of actions of

7
participants, if any, and as to the duties and obligations of
plan trustees to the beneficiaries»
A review of the National Labor Relations Act, the
Wagner Act, was undertaken by the National Labor Relations
Board in its seminal decision in Inland Steel, which is at
77 NLRB»

The Board, after reviewing both the 1935 statute

and the 1947 amendments to that statute, which would have
changed the term "other conditions of employment" to a more
narrow term, "working conditions", stated that it was compelled
to the conclusion»

And we find that matters affecting tenure

of employment, like the respondents, Inland Steel's retirement
rule, are within the statutory scopa of collective bargaining»
And the National Labor Relations Board found that
the debates in 1947 over those proposed amendments were
"compelling evidence", that reitrment plans were within the
1935 Act's intent»
Tha significant of this, may it please the Court,
should not be lost because 1935 is the same chronological
era that the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts were being put into
law.

So in 1935, whereas the Securities Act said nothing,

Congress was speaking distinctly to the issue under the
National Labor Relations Act»
QUESTIONi

Of course, Mr» Camel 1, not every

retirement plan is a product of collective bargaining»

We had

one before us last term on Allied Structural Steel, which was

8
not at all the product of collective bargaining, and therefore
it wouldn’t have involved any of the rights or liabilities
under the National Labor Relations Act or the Labor-Management
Relations Act of 1947? isn’t that correct?
MR0 CARMELLs

It is correct to the extent, Your

Honor, that they all ware not necessarily bargained for»

But,

in due respect:, it is not correct, to the extent that all
pension plans were subjects for collective bargaining»

That

is, 8(5) of the old Act, the 1935 Act, and 8(a)(5) of the
present Act, only refers to those — only encompasses mandatory
subjects for bargaining»
QUESTIONs

Yes, but sometimes there’s not even a

collectiva bargaining agent»
plant, such

I mean, if it’s a non-unionized
i

as I guess Allied Structural Steal was, the

plaintiffs wouldn’t have had three out of these other four
causes of action, would they?
MR» CARMELLs
action under Section 302,

Couldn’t have had»

They would not have had cause of
That is correct»

Thera was no

cause of action under the WPP DA, -there was no private cause
of action under the NLRA or the LMRA.

That is correct, Your

Honor»
But, as I would hope to explain, that was Congress’s
deliberate choice, and is moot fully canvassed in this Court's
decision in Malone as to the specific choices that Congress
mad®

9

But I would like to address once more your specific
point»

I am not saying that the NLRA covered only collectively

bargained plana, I am saying that Congress considered retire*»
menfc plans, and the Inland Steel plan has been in existence
for a long period of time before that, as being a subject for
collective bargaining.
So, whereas the Court of Appeals said that the reason
why Congress, in the Securities Act, did not consider pension
plan© or mention them was that they were rather innocuous in
number.

The same Congress relatively was considering them to

be of sufficient importance to be considered within mandatory
subjects of bargaining, as opposed to permissive subjects of
bargaining.
1947, as Your Honors have already pointed out, saw
Congress enact Section 302(c)(5), and I think the significance
of Section 302, Your Honors, is that Congress made a deliberate
choice.

It chose only to regulate collectively bargained

pension plans, as Mr, Justice Stewart stated^ although it had
before it considerations of other issues.

And it chose than

to only regulate the structure of the plan and certain of the
extents and the purposes for which the Fund could be used? ®
very, very limited regulation by Congress.

But a very

deliberate regulation, as this Court discussed in Arroyo vs.
United States,
But the Welfare and Pension Plan Disclosure Act, the

10

proceedings from 1954 on*, which were fully canvassed in this
Court’s decision in Malone, are really the most significant,
I believe.

Because Malone stated'

nearly unregulated pension field"„

that Congress entered "a
And Congress heard from

numerous witnesses, beginning in 1955, including the Securities
and Exchange Commissiona

And Commissioner Goodwin agreed with

Senator Allott, in 1955, that "the Securities and Exchange
Commission would come into this particular field only by
accident, so to speak, by virtue of the fact that, for example,
in some of these plans stock is offered"»
After Congress heard all of the witnesses, including
the Commission, it issued a Senate Report which is quoted, and
I won’t go through it all, at pages 29 and 30 of our brief,
stating that they just didn’t think there was any federal
regulation of these plans, but chose not to regulate it
substantively, but, as this Court noted, just to allow filings»
By 1972, Your Honors well know, as this discussion in
Manhart indicates, Congress had completely changed its mind
and had completely, made a complete turnaround as far as the
priorities, and it therefore, under ERISA, detailed the timing,
nature and disclosure that was to be made to plan participants
and for the first time, under Section 502(a), granted a
limited right of suit by a plan participant, and granted a
conjunctive right to sue with the Secretary of Labor»
The 1958 Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act’s

11

failure to include a private right of action was not an
accident# Your Honor, because# as our brief has shown# it
rejected proposals by Professors Meltzer and Cox that would
have established anagolous right of action*
ERISA’s design was careful# complex, discreet# and
fraught with a great number of problems«,

But in the end the

Court of Appeals was not satisfied with Congress's action in
this field*

It felt the plan paricipants deserved more.

made value judgments*
entrusted to

If

Judgments which the Congress is

make and which the Congress specifically did not

make *
Under those circumstances# this case# 1 believe#
and the courts below# stand for the proposition that a court
can expand through the problems of the Securities Act to
enact that type of legislation which# for almost 37 years#
the Congress deliberately reviewed to enact# to give protection
to plan participants that Congress would not give# and to posit
causes of action which Congress disclaimed*
QUESTION! Well# wouldn’t you agree that Judge Tone’s
concurring opinipn is evidence of anything but a value judgment#
that he instinctoly — his sense of values or his instinctive
sense would have led him the other way# but he thought he was
drivers to this conclusion by the language of the statute®
Isn’t that about what he said?
MR* CARMELLs

I don’t believe it was — by the

12

breadth of the statues and by the fact that this Court has not
spoken particularly to the issue, 1 believe was another factor,
I don’t know why Judge Tone’s opinion did not end
with "I

dissent", because I believe it was written up to that

point so it sounded that way.
So x cannot divine that, Your Honor,

But 1 don’t

believe that full consideration was given to the labor
statutes, the line, the cohesive line from the labor statutes
on one side and the absence of anything definitive on the
other side.
As I said, Your Honors, the reversal of this case
does not end the case.

It will leave Mr, Daniel and his class,

the plaintiffs, with four causes of action under the federal
labor statutes and under State common law fraud,
QUESTIONS

Mr, Carmeli, before you sit down, does

the record tell us what significance, if any, there is to the
fact that Danial took a withdrawal card.
to his

Is that critical

ineligibility?
MR, CARMELLs

I don't believe that the issue, as

framed now, that question is critical,

I believe that the

Appendix does show only a — or the brief does show a statement
that was contained in one of the plan booklets that '“your
benefits terminate if you take a withdrawal card”.
For the purposes of this case, Justice Stevens, we
are accepting the fact that he had a break in service which

13
was involuntary and by a layoff, arid will accept for the
premise that it should have only

run four months,

I don’t

believe that the question of the application of the break in
service rule is relevant'to the Securities Act count, because
if it!s an arbitrary structural violation, under Section
302(c)(5) thare is & remedy, or at least there appears — the
District Court has said that there is a remedy,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

Mr, Dickstela,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY DICK3TEXN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO, 77-753
MR, DXCKSTEXNs

Mr, Chief Justice and may it pleas®

the Courts
As Mr® Carmall has indicated, there is no dispute
that in the extensive legislative history that preceded the
enactment of She Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934, and in the
statutes themselves initially enacted, there was no mention
whatever of pension plans.
Certainly the reason for not mentioning pension plans
could not have been, as the court below suggested, that they
war© such a rare bird that Congress simply ignored them or
overlooked them.

At the time of the enactment of the
/

Securities laws, three and a half to four million united
American employees, employed by hundreds of large industrial
corporations, were covered by pension plans.

14
Moreover, the Congress was legislating with respect
to pensions in the Revenue Acts of 1926,, 8 28, 8 32 and 8 34,
in the Railroad Retirement Act of 1934, and, as Mr* Carmeli
has indicated, they played a role in the legislative history
of the National Labor Relations Act*
It is not our point that this was a subject for
special legislative concern in the collective bargaining area*
It is rather our point that whenever Congress turned to the
subject of pension, it was functioning in the employer-employee
area, of which collective bargaining is of course just one
factor»
We believe the reason why one finds no mention whateven of pensions in the Securities laws is that, as this Court
said in Fog-man, the Congress*s focus in enacting those laws
was to deal with the

capital markets of the enterprise system

and to regulate the sale of securities, to raise capital for
profit-making purposes.
Whan we speak of pansions upon retirement from
employment, we are not dealing with the capital market, we are
dealing with the labor market*

Nor are we talking about the

raising of capital for profit-making purposes»
Certainly pensions are not included within the types
of arrangements that, again to quote the Court in Forman,, min
our commercial world fall within the ordinary concept of a
security

15
This short, straightforward analysis, which occupied
eight pages of our opening brief, is, we believe, the answer
her©»

The transaction under which someone goes to work for an

employer and is thereby covered by a noncontributory pension
plan as an incident of his employment is, like the transaction,
in Forman, simply not a purchase of securities 9 within the
contemplation of federal securities laws»
There is one type of pension plan which is
unarguably covered by the securities laws*

This is a. type of

voluntary contributory plan where employee contributions are
used to purchase the employer's stock «— to put it another
way, to add capital to th© employer's coffers for profit™
making purposesa
But this is not covered because it is a pension plan,
but rather because it ie an employee stock purchase plan»
tod the fact that it has pension or retirement features does
not alter that basic fact»
The SEC has consistently treated such plans as
subject to th© Securities tot, has advised Congress to that
effect, and no one seriously quarrels with that proposition*
QUESTION s

tod in that case the security is the

stock of th© employer corporation, rather than the participa™
tion in the pension plan?
MR» DICKSTEXNs

Your Honor, the Securities and

Exchange Commission's position is that in that transaction

16

there are two securities involved,,

One is the interest in the

plan under which the stock is purchased, and the other is the
stock of the employer as well.
QUESTIONs

Well, if one is the interest of the plan,

then why isn't this a security?
MR0 DXCKSTEXN2

The interest of the plan in the

special circumstance in which employer stock is bought with
employe© money is indivisible with the arrangement, the entire
arrangement under which that stock is purchased»
Here we are not talking about the purchase of
employer stock at all, in the noncontributory
QUESTION t

But we are talking about a participating

interest in a retirement plan»
MR, DXCKSTEXNs We are talking about a participating
interest in ***QUESTION?

And if it's a security in one case, why

isn’t it in the other?
Quite apart from the employer's stock,
MR, DXCKSTEXNs
Your Honor,

There are several reasons for that,

On© reason, of course, is that in the type of

plan that the SEC has always considered to represent a security,
the employee’s money is being used to capitalize the employer,
The employer is selling securities to the employee and the
vehicle, the plan by which he does it, is simply the wraparound.
In the type of plan that’s involved here, that is,

17
the noncontributory , mandatory plan —» and for that matter 1
would add the voluntary contributory plan in which there is
no investment in employer stock of employee dollars»
not used to fund the employer's enterprise,,

This is

And we think in

that case -QUESTIONs

1 understand that»

And 1 understand that

you concede that that one specie.! kind of retirement plan is
subject to SEC jurisdiction under the securities l&wa p and
I understand the factual difference»

But I don't

understand

if the participatory interest in the retirement plan itself
is a security in one case, why isn't it in the other?
MR» DICKSTEINs

Your Honor, the answer again is that

in ths instance: where the employee's money is buying employer
stock, that ha© always been treated as a transaction covered
by the securities laws»
QUESTIONS

1 understand that»

MR» DICKSTEINs

Aid if one wraps that basic trans-

action around the retirement plan in which the stock which is
purchased is kept in a fund that is ultimately given to the
employee on retirement, or ultimately sold in order to fund
his retirement, that does not change that basic reality»
It is still
QUESTION*

Well, in this case the funda for the

plan are used to buy what are concededly securities, is it not?
MR® DICKSTEIN *

No, Your Honor, we do not»

18
QUESTION s

Not?

MR. DICKSTEIN s

Not only do we not concede it to ba

securities in this case, we believe that Congress has not
considered it to be securities, and the SEC, and until quite
recently —
QUESTION s

But the funds of many retirement plans

are used to buy •»MR. DICKSTEIN s
QUESTION?

— the SEC did not maintain that.

Well, what are the funds, how are the

funds invested in this plan?

Not in securities?

In no

securities at all?
MR. DICKSTEINs

They — no, Your Honor, of course

they are invested in securities.
QUESTION:

Wall, that was my question. That was my

question.
MR. DICKS TEIN:

Oh, yes.

But they are not -■» in

this instance, of course, they are not invested in employer
securities.
QUESTION5

But they are invested in securities.

MR. DXCKSTEXNs
in securities.

But even —» but they are invested

Unquestionably.

Ana it is quite clear that

because the investment of pension funds in a portfolio of
securities, that is, the securities that are purchased with
those funds, does involve tha Securities Act; nobody has ever
challenged that.

That’s quite clear.

19
tod quit© consistent with ERISA, as a matter of facto
Because in ERISA when the Congress -- in ERISA there is a
definition of the term "security” which utilises the definition
in the Securities Act of 13330
throughout, every time that

And when you read the Act

term'i3 used in connection with

the purchase of securities for the portfolio of the pension
fund, it is not used in connection with the interest of the
participants in that fund? for that Congress chooses quite
different words®
But the fact of the coverage of one, that is the
portfolio securities, under the Securities Act, does not by
any means mean that the participating interest of the employee
is thereby a security»
As a matter of fact, in the early
QUESTION s

on®

And yet you concede that it is in the

case»
MR® DICKSTEINs

Your Honor, yes,

1

do, because it is

clearly a security® The SEC has taken the position that it is
from the very outsat®

It has advised Congress that that is

the circumstance, the only circumstance, which involves the
Securities Act? that is th© circumstances pertaining to pension
plans®

And Congress has proceeded on that perception®
QUESTION §

Mr® Dickstein, are you -«° I take it you’re

making the argument that even if there wore no labor laws at;
all, no federal labor statutes, and only the securities laws,

20
that this would not bs a security»
MR, DICKSTEINs
QUESTIONt

Yes? Your Honor, we are,

Are you also arguing that even if it

otherwise would be a security, the federal labor laws in
effect make an exception fee the securities laws, or not?
MR» DXOCSTEXNs

No, Your Honor, we are not arguing

exception, but what wa are arguing —
QUESTIONS

You ars not arguing that th® labor laws

require a different construction of the securities laws than
otherwise would be true?
MR, DICKSTEINs

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

And the reason

why wa say that is because we are dealing here with a question
of congressional intent, and Confess, it is Congress which has
acted in the pension area, it has acted expressly with respect
to Securities Act disclosures, and that of course is what we
are talking about bars, in the WPPDA of 1958, ant in ERISA in
1974e
QUESTION?

So you say the impact of the labor laws

is equivalent to their being an excaption in the securities
laws? is that your argument or not?
MR, DXCKSTEXNs

An exception, an interdiction, an

inhibition of that construction, whichever way "« 1 think on©
can fairly put it that way,
QUESTIONS
of your argument

X understood that the principal thrust
not that you don't make the one suggested

21
in your answer to my brother White # but the principal thrust
©f your argument with respect to the labor laws and WPPDA and
ERISA is that they reflect congressional understanding that
pension plans are simply not cowared by the securities laws*
MR* DICKSTEINs They reflected both congressional
understandings and actions based upon —
QUESTIONs

Based upon that understanding* Right*

MR* DICKSTEINs

««■» those understandings*

Quite

correct*
And this is an understanding to which the SEC as a
natter of fact made the major contribution*

ibid we think that

Congress# hawing acted in that fashion# even if it were once
possible to construe the securities laws in a fashion that
would cover this type of arrangement# that is no longer
possible# because again we are dealing with a matter of
congressional intent*
QUESTION a

Of course there's a basic question that

I always wonder about*

Th© congressional intent wo * re really

concerned about is back in 1935# isn't it?
or '33 and '34*

Or '33# rather?

And all this stuff comes later*

MR* DICKSTEINs

That is certainly true*

And if ws deal with congressional Intent back in
1933 and '34 and interdict it at. that point# cut it off at
that point# what would the congressional perception have been?
That's really a question —

22
QUESTIONS

Well, it's clear they used some broad

language that encompassed some situations they did not
specifically contemplate at that time * That much I think you
have to concede.
MR. DXCKSTEXNs
with pensions

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

But in dealing

we? are not dealing with some new device, we’re

not dealing with some recent invention. We’re dealing with
something which existed then, existed as a significant force
in American labor relations. And it is Congress’s perception,
as it then existed, as to whether or not pension funds were
covered by the securities laws, which ia of course the
significant aspect.
QUESTION t

The Court of Appeals was apparently

influenced by the fact that pension money ia a huge percentage
of tha total capital market of today, and was a. vary small
percentage in ’33.
MR. DICKSTElNs

No question about it®

It was -- as

a matter of fact, it was because of the growth in pensions in
the mid-Fifties that Congress turned to the expressed concern
with the absence of disclosure to pension plan participants,
and conducted its studies very, very carefully and inquired
into the subject over a long period of time, and enacted the
Welfare and Pension Plan Disclosure Act as an expression of
concern
As pension funds became more important, Congress re-

23
visited the subject of pension plans and provided for a further
disclosurey disclosures, which, as.one reads ERISA, you have
to conclude are detailed, comprehensive and all-embracing»
In addition to which it enacted substantive regulations with
respect to pension plans which, up until that time, had not
been a matter of federal concern»
And so it was the congressional reaction to this
economic reality of the growing importance of pension funds
that we're dealing with here,
QUESTIONs

Of course if you go back to .1934, there

is no private right of action at all undor 10(b) of the '34
Act,

You can win your case on that basis,
[Laughter,1
MR, DICKSTEIN s

That little acorn may have grown

into too much of an oak for that, Your Honor,
Although I would say that in the contest of this
case, and certainly it is in our question presented, that in
determining whether or not there is an implied private right
of action under the antifraud provisions of the securities
laws, one can wall consider

the Court has on occasion

considered it — what the subject matter is, and how far one
is prepared to go,
But whether there's an implied right of action under
other circumstances, of course I would be prepared, I suppose,
to accept, at least arguendo, for purposes of this case, that

24
ouch right of action existse
There are several observations to make about the SEC'ss
present position.

One is that when it says, "0hp we ©11 along

knew that these noncontributory pension plans were covered by
the Securities Act, we were only talking, when we said that
there was no sal© and hence they were not covered, we were only
talking about the registration provisionis and not about the
antifraud provisions,w
Suffice it t© say, if there were one incident in the
extensive legislative history of Commission stations, of
Commission reports, of Commission analysis, in which the SEC
had taken the affirmative position before the Congress *»» or,
for that matter, anywhere else,

that 'the antifraud laws

are applicable to interests in noncontributory pension plans,
EEC counsel would be trumpeting it here? but he will not,
because there is non®.
And so the SEC really is a fallback position* it says,
“Well, we*ve rethought it, 45 years have made a great deal.of
difference in the world of pensions, and we now think that
whan an employee goes to work for an employer and lias in mind
the pension plan and is influenced in going to work for that:
employer by -the existence of the pension plan, he has
purchased a security within the meaning of the securities lews.*
“What's more*', say a the SEC, "when he goes to work
each day, again so long as ha has the pension plan in mind as

25
an inducement, he is continuing to purchase that security."
QUESTIONS And when he quits work, ha sells it, X
suppose?
MRs DXCKSTEIMs

Well, that is precisely one of the

points which of course differentiates what we have here from
what we have in a conventional security in the commercial sense,,
or even a nonconventional security in a congressional sense»
The employe© has no interest t© sell,

lie has the right, under

certain circumstances, upon the fulfillment of employment
requirements, to receive a retirement pension.

And that fact

aloae, I think, is th© significant differential,
At this point I would like to save the balance of
my time for rebuttal.
QUESTIONs

Just one question, counsel. There's been

seme comment in th© questions to you about the difference
between the situation that existed 40-odd years ago and today,
in terms of the amount of investment in pension funds that are
within th© rang© of collective bargaining,
I suppose you would concede that if Congress wanted
to re-examine the situation today, or in the next Session,
that those changes would bs a mejor factor in their approach
to tha problem, and might lead to a different result from what
you're arguing now.

You might say that -these are securities,

in other words.

No,

QUESTION:

That's all I'm asking,

MR, DICK STEIN s

Biit they have already acted at least

twice, based upon the new evidence of the mounting importance
of pensions in this country»

And when they have done so, they

have acted in a manner which is inconsistent with the notion
that an interest in a non contributory pension pier, is the
security, and that disclosures are required under the securities
laws to supplement ERISA.
Your Honor, you simply cannot road ERISA, and
particularly the statements of policies in Section 1 and the
disclosure provisions in Sections 101 through 111, without
coming away with the strongest of beliefs that Congress
thought that in the disclosure area on pensions it was writing
on a blank slate, end it wrote on that slate what it wished to
have there.

And that, of course, is the point.

The legislative history of ERISA totally confirms
that, and that which the SIC said to the Congress totally
confirms that belief,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACOB H. STILLMAN, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF S.E.C. AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR® STILLMAN*

Mr® Chief Justice and may it please

the Court?
The Solicitor General has requested ma to state at
the outsat that although the Securities and Exchange Commission
is participating in this case on a motion made jointly by the

28

Commission and the Solicitor General; I am ©stressing the
views only of the Commission and not of the Solicitor General,
who takes a different view of the case»
This is a securities case, and the issue before tills
Court is the interpretation of tarns in the securities lawsc
Specifically the terms "security" and "sale".

And it is to

that question, those legal issues under the securities laws,
that the Commission, aa amicus curia©, is addressing its views,
because the Commission believes that the resolution of those
issues is important to investors.
Of the two issues, "security” and "sale", we believe
that the resolution of the security question has a much greater
potential impact on investors and, for that reason, I would
lilce to address that issue first.
QUESTIONs

Going back to what you said at fch© outset,,

the Solicitor General does agree with yon on the sale issue,
does he not?
MR. STILLMAN;

Yes, Your Honor, on 'that issue ha does

agree.
.

#

In considering whether this is a security, Mr. Daniel,.
■c

for more than 22 years, worked for employers who, in

return

for his labor, mads contributions to his union's pension fund,
I think a very vivid description of why this is e security is
contained in the union's own literature that it distributed to
its members.

If I may quote two sentences from page 70a 14

2S
of the Appendix, in one of the brochures that the union
distributed it contains this description of the pension fund,
and of the member's contribution ~ of the contributions that
are made on behalf of the members»
.It says, "the contributions earn income by being
invested®

Consequently, the money originally contributed grows,

Without this income growth the Fund could not accumulate enough
money to pay ‘the $250® 00 monthly pensions provided by the
Plan®B
That, in a nutshell, is tfhafc an investment contract
is®
Outside of the employment context, it is clear that
a participation in a fund of this sort, which invests its
assets and returns more money at a later date, is a security®
And through a series of six decisions of this Court, beginning
with the Joiner case in 1943 and continuing most recently
through the Forman decision in 1975, this Court has construed
the term '’investment contract®’3
And those decisions demonstrate that so long as
there is present the type of relationship found in this case,
a relationship in which the investor participate© in a common
venture with the expectation of profits to be derived from the
managerial efforts of others, there is a security®

All the

requisite features are present hare.

QUESTIONS

Isn't it true that different employees

can contribute different amounts of labor and have the same
amount be contributed to the pension fund?

Isn't it so many

dollars per employee, without regard to their salary level,
number of hours worked, and 3© forth?
MR® STILLMANs

I believe that is 30, Your Honor, but

that does not affect the basic relationship which this Court
has recognised in a series of six decisions, going back many
years as giving rise to an investment contract®

And it is

that relationship which is the significant thing, because
that relationship contains the elements that provide the
need for the kind of protections that the securities laws
afford.
QUESTIONs

take the position that an agreement such as this was an invest*»

3.1

MR» STILLMAN:

It is important to differentiate,, as

2 think you're doing, the question of security versus tha
qxsestion of sale»
Gn the question of whether it is a security, tha
Commission took the position ©s far back as 1941, in the
testimony that Commissioner Purcell gave, that interest in
pension plans are securities»
The defendants dispute the scope of what Commissioner
Purcell was referring to.

They say that he was only referring

t© interests in voluntary contributory plans»
I think an examination of what he said will show that
it was not so limited» Because, when he talked about the no-sale!
rational© as being applicabis to the typo of plan involved
here, an involuntary noncontributory plan, that was the very
same type of plan that he also had in mind as involving a
security»
QUESTIONS

Well, in the intervening 3? years, why

wasn’t the Commission out seeking injunctions against one or
another of these plans that, presumably, juat by tha law of
averages, would have proved fraudulent or failure to disclose?

MR» STILLMANt

Your Honor, the question of why at

any given point, in time, or over the period of years, certain
types of activity does not give rise to proceedings, whether
it be a Commission proceeding or even private proceedings, is

32

something that’s very difficult to answer®

it wasn’t until recently that they considered this to be a

QUESTIONS Well; what ©bout the : sale, what about

MR® STILLMANs
Honor®

That’s what I was getting to, Your

The focus of the Commission’s statements over the

years as to whether it was a sale, the focus was in the
contest of registration, and indeed Judge Tone, in his
concurring opinion — who, as you know, was critical of the
Commission °3» acknowledged that the focus was really in the
context of registration®
Now, it’s true the Commission did not coma out and
affirmatively say, "We are only talking about registration,
and the no«©ale rationale does not apply for fraud purposes®55
But it was clearly in that context®
Now, as to why the Commission did not, over the years,
take enforcement action in the fraud area, with respect to
pension plans?

First of all, there is no indication that even

in the case of the voluntary contributory that the Commission
took enforcement action, based upon the theory that the interest
was a security and that there was a sale®

33

QUESTION?

He testified that the SEC h&d no business

with this, end didn't know? anything about it, and "pleas©
don't give us any jurisdiction ever it'1,
MR» STILLMAN?

Your Honor, in context I think that

34
has to be judged in terras of the kinds of legislation that
was then before Congress»

It was a kind of legislation far

different from a simpla antifraud provision»

It was legisla­

tion that would have imposed considerable day-to-days obliga­
tions of a more formal natura on people involved in the pension
area, it would have required the Commission itself to engage
in administering those provisions»
In that context, to say that the Commission was not
the proper agency to administer that kind of legislation is
far different from saying that there is no sale of a security»
Congress itself, in the securities laws, in connection with
certain types of regulations, has recognised that even though
there is a sale of a security, not all types of regulation
under the securities laws should apply»
For example, the periodic reporting provisions of
the Securities and Exchange Act»
is a market interest.

They only apply where there

Larger corporations with securities

traded in the market»
Now, that doesn't mean that if you have a corpora­
tion that doesn't rise to that lave! you don’t have sales of
securities.

If this

is a security, and if this is a sale, what is the policy
reason for saying that there’s no need for registration, if

The reason that was originally given

back in Commissioner Purcell's testimony, bock in 1941, he
did not really go for policy questions,

MR, STILLMAN:

It was based upon the view at that

not important enough to require the registration as well?

MR, STILLMAN:

At the present time, given the

enactioenfc of ERISA,as a policy matter registration probably
would not h® a needed thing,
QUESTION:

You mean registration under the "33 Act?

MR, STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right,

Under the Securities Act of ’33?

36
MR. STILLMAN5

Registration at the present time,

given ERISA, ERISA has requirements for the filing with the
government and the dissemination of a disclosure document.
QUESTIONS But prior to the enactment of ERISA it
would seem that the reasons why th© antifraud previsions apply
should equally have applied to the registration statement,
ehouldn * t they?
MR. STILLMANs

If I may refer to this Court’s

decision in the National Securities case, in a different
content, it involved th© question of whether an exchange of
securities by a shareholder in connection with a merger
constituted a sal® for purposes of the antifraud provisions,
and the Court holds

yes, that it was a sale.

In the face of Commission interpretation over the
years and Commission rule, saying that for registration purposes;
it was not a sal®.
At that time the rule was premised to some extent
on th® same kind of rationale that was originally used by the
Commission in the case of pensions.

Lack of individual volition

on the part of the shareholder who votes for the merger and
therefore not a sale.
And the Court expressly recognised that the term ''sale"
can have a different meaning for registration purposes than
what it means for sale purposes.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Stillman, do you think the Commission

37

is aa free after this relative period of quiescence to take
the position it now does, in view of the enactment of WPPDA
in 1958 and ERISA in 1974,, as it would have been prior to
the enactment of those lews?
MR. STILLMAN*

Yes, Your Honor.

It seems to me that those laws really have -«* I
cannot see what effect they have on the imminq of the word
«security" and the meaning of the word "sale”»
QUESTION*

Wall, but Congress has really been

proceeding on two different tracks, hasn't it, at least since
1958?

One for securities and one for pension funda»
MR. STILLMAN*

But there is really no indication that

Congress clearly believed that the antifraud provisions were
not applicable,

Th© kind of legislation that Congress was

enacting in the pension area was such that it could have
hardly made a difference whether the antifraud provisions were
applicable®
In other words, tha suggestion ia mad© by ths
defendants that had Congress realised the antifraud provisions
were applicable, it could have had a significant effect on
whether they would have enacted the kind of pension /.legisla­
tion.

I don’t see that.

The pension legislation that we’re

talking about imposed detailed affirmative disclosure filing
requirements, the preparation of documents and, as you get
into more recent years of ERISA, massive regulatory provisions®

38

It's hardly likely that because of the presence of
an antifraud provision Congress would have declined to enact
that other kind of legislation. Congress, in tha securities
laws, didn’t decline to enact the registration provision
simply because there was an antifraud provision.
The other legislation stood on its own and was
necessary even with the presence of an antifraud provision,
QUESTION5

Mr, Stillman, you’ve been talking about

the definition of security, which of course is a threshold
issue,

I’m looking at Section 3(a) (10) of the ’34 Act, which

is substantially like 2(1) of the Act of ’33,
term "investment contract”,

You rely on the

Both of those sections also have,

as a catchall, "any instrument commonly known as a 'security5*,
I’d like to' ask you whether or not you think in
1933 or '34 participation in a pension plan would have been
considered to be something "commonly known as a security"?
MR® STILLMANs

In terms of tha man on the street,

the employee, if you ask him, "Is your pension a security?"
I suppose he would say no,
QUESTIONS

Would anybody have fsaid yes?

MR, STILLMAN %

Pardon?

QUESTION? Who would have said yes?
MR, STILLMAN:

That is really irrelevant. This

Court has recognised clearly that that provision does not
limit in any way the other provisions.

39

QUESTIONi

Well, let’s assume it is irrelevant»

Who

would have said y@s?
Would you?
MR» STILLMAN:
QUESTIONi

Someone who would have looked at —

I’m not asking Justice Stewart, I'm

asking you,
QUESTION;

H® would, that’s for sure»

[Laughter#]
MRo STILLMANs

If I had looked to sea how a pension

fund actually operates, to see, as was stated in the few
sentences that 1 read from the union’s brochure in this case,
exactly how it worked, that the moneys are invested, the
profits are returned, that those profits are necessary to
make the payments; yes, that
definition of —

fits this Court’s long-standing

,

QUESTION; Well, let me ask you another question
about these two sections»

They define ‘the term "securityR

first of all in terms of 18 or 20 different types of securities
that are identified;

"The term means note, stock, teasury

stock, bond, debenture” and so on, for 18 or 20 of those,
including, among other things, participation in any profitsharing agreement#
Do you think it might have occurred to somebody in
Congress that if they had indeed intended to include pension
plans, to have included participation in a pension plan among

40
the 18 to 20 things they did itemise?
MR* STILLMANS
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, the whole —

You don't think it would have occurred to

them?
MR® STILLMAN:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe so®

The v;hole framework of putting in particularly the provision
"investment contract" was to have a residual provision to
see to it that people would not be able to evade the securities
laws because the instrument or the investment that they had
was something that didn't fit on© of the more particular
provisions®

It was a very broad, all-encompassing provision®

And this Court has mad© it very clear that specific
provisions in that definition «*- it said so in the Joiner case,
I believe — do not limit in any way the other provisions
like "investment contract"®

And the definition that this

Court has developed over since the Joiner case and has been
developed by this Court and the lower courts for ever 40 years,
clearly encompass this kind of an interest®
The defendants' salience on Forman as somehow having
overturned all this history, we think is really misplaced®
The Court itself didn't view Forman as being anything mors
than an application of the pre-existing standards®

Basically

Forman was a holding that substance over form is a two-way
street®
And just as in the prior cases® it had been used

41
against defendants? in the Forman case it was used against
the plaintiff.

But it really didn’t change the law.

And,

in particular, the reliance on Forman is really as a basis for
claiming that somehow the united Benefit case is no longer
the law, where, in United Benefit, the Court clearly held
that the security element could be separated from the insurance
element, and they also, in effect, say that Forman has over­
ruled the long line of cases a© to whether an instrument in
order to b© a security has to be
the max'ket.

something that's traded in

That is definitely not the law, and to say that

a decision like Forman, which the Court did not view as being
any change, has somehow eliminated all that, to us seems
totally unreasonable.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time has expired

now, Mr. Stillman.
MR. STILLMAN:

Okay.

May I just say on© thing at the

end?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. STILLMAN:

Ver/ briefly.

The Commission*ra concern in this case

is not solely with respect to the applicability of the antifraud previous to pension plans.

The definition of investment

contracts over the years has served as probably the singlemost
important factor in preventing people from avoiding the
securities laws through us© of unusual, novel devices. And
if the defendants’ position is accepted, it would have far-

42
reaching effects beyond the pension plan area»

And that

is of major concern to the Commission.
Thank you.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Mainer.

OHM. ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE WALNER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WALNER;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
I would like to address my remarks 'to the Doomsday .
argument advanced by the Teamsters, the denial of any possible
remedy to a large group on the questions of sale.

My

colleague will take up th© question of th© definition of
security and the legislative history and congressional intent.
We would like to emphasis© the fallacy of the Doomsday
argument created by the Teamsters and soma of their amici in
this case.
Me have alleged that Mr. Daniel was intentionally,
fraudulently induced to invest in th® Teamster Pension Fund
by materially misleading information.
Tfca Teamsters originally claimed in th© Court of
Appeals that upholding the Daniel decision would result in
pension industry liability of $200 billion.

Now this was

reduced by 80 percent, to $40 billion, by some of their amici»
But even this amount is incredible and an absurd
claim, we suggest.

In fact, I wonder if th© amici propounding

43
this position really perceive the essence of what they are
asserting.
This figure that they suggest assumes that $40 billion
of pension funds are sold both with materially misleading
information,, as wall as the concurrent scienter requirements
an intent to defraud.

There is absolutely nothing to support

the allegation that so many funds ar© sold with that requisite
intent®
QUESTIONs

Under your argument, wouldn't thay have to

be registered, even though not fraudulent.?
MR. WALNER:

No, sir®

There is a registration

exemption, we feel, under Section 3(a)(2), and this only goes
to the issue of antifraud? we feel registration is expressly
exempt, was expressly exempt in the decision of the Seventh
Circuit®

Ws feel it's expressly covered by an exemption in

the statute itself, as wall as long-standing SEC policy®
QUESTIONs

Of course, long-standing SEC policy would

cause you to los© your case, wouldn't it?
MR. WALNER:
QUESTIONS

Well —
The Court had no difficulty in Sloan,

in

avoiding a long-standing policy that went back to the same
period, I think®
MR® WALNER:

We feel they are still covered under

the express exemption 3(a)(2) of th© ?33 Act, and we feel that
the express term® of the statute otherwise embrace the anti-

44
fraud provisions .

The registration requirement is the

provision that's exempted from compliance.
The Teamsters, when they tried to bring down the
Grubb study against reduced their Doomsday argument from a
figure of three and a half to thirteen and a half billion.
But the Grubb study totally ignored the scienter requirement
of the Ernst case.

And, in effect, estimated the liability

that would result if the vesting and break~in»service provisions
of ERISA ware made retroactive, and not the liability if the
antifraud provisions of the securities laws were applied to
pensions retroactively.
X would like to just read two sentences at the and
of the Grubb report, to show you how far they backed off from
thair damage claims.
"Most terminated non™vested participants have not
bean led to expect that they were entitled to a pension.

If

liability exists only with respect to terminated participants
who received information leading thorn to believe —*•» leading
them to expect a pension, it does not apply to most terminated
participants.

In such a case the potential liability would

b© a very small fraction of the amount shown.65
Now, even in the Schlansky case, which followed
Daniel, in upholding the pension t© be a security, the
complaint was dismissed for failure to allege facts establishing
scienter

45

Now, there is no requirement, as we understand it,
under 10(b) that anything be told the members.

But when

something is told to them, all that is required is a bona fide
attempt to truthfully inform the members, on whose behalf
contributions ©re mad©, of their rights and risk of loss.
Evan if the information is not correct, the absence of
scienter as required by the Ernst case will bar any claims
for liability under the antifraud provisions of the securities

laws*

QUESTION3

You mean — you’re talking generally, or

just about welfare funds?

I’m sure the SEC wouldn’t agree

with your very loos® duty that your language seams to imposes
upon an issuer or the writer of a proxy statement. All that
is required is a good-faith effort.
MR. WALNER*

I'm talking only about the antifraud

pro-vis ions.
QUESaiOMs
MR. WALNER:

Yes.
I think if there’s an absence of

scienter under a private cause of action, there simply is no
cause of action.
QUESTION*

Well —

MR. WALNER* And I think that is clear in the Ernst
case.
QUESTION*
MR. WALNER?

— scienter or its equivalent.
Pardon me?

46

QUESTIONS Scienter or its equivalent,,
MR. WALNERs
QUESTIONS

Yes ? sir»
That's what was held in the Ernst case?

basically»
MR. WALNERs
QUESTION s

Yes,
In your view? Mr» Walner? is there any

difference between the elements of a recovery in a 10b-5 action
mid a common-law fraud action?
MR. WALNERs

Thera may be soma differences in the

kind and categories of proof? and I would like to point out
in that connection that since ERISA has bean discussed as, in
effect? a preemption fcyp© argument — although they haven't
used the word "preemption19 —=» that ERISA has cut off commonlaw fraud? absolutely? under Section 514„

They have cut off

all common law and statutory State remedies.
So? at least with respect to the people who must
claim affar the affective date of ERISA, they are not able to
claim any benefit from common-lav/ fraud or common-law breach,
of fiduciary obligation? or any State statutes in that regard?
and the Teamsters themselves point that out in a footnote in
their brief? citing Section 514 of ERISA.
QUESTIONS

Is the.ro a claim that ERISA has destroyed

your common law claim?
MR. WALNERs

No? sir? our — we were slightly? I

think inadvertently? misquoted by Mr. Carmeli.

Our contention

47
is that wa are a pre-ERXSA case, because Mr» Daniel retired
before the effective date of ERISA.

ERISA has been the

subject of so much discussion, as it may reflect both the
intent of Congress and what position people find themselves in
with respect to potential remedy.
One of the things I intended to go into later related
to fcha cutoff by ERISA of common-law claimsj for example, a
person in a corporate pension fund, what are his rights?
What are his remedies for intentional fraud to induce?
He no longer has a common law or State statutory
right of any character under 5,140

Now, if you deny him the

antifraud provision protection, so that if he’s fraudulently
induced to invest in a pension plan, h© will have no remedy
whatsoever for that activity.
QUESTIGN:

Well, are you suggesting that Congress

deliberately cut off a group of remedies but preserved this
one?
MR. WALNER:

Your Honor, I*m suggesting that —

QUESTION: Why would they —
MR. WALNER;

— it was never intended to cut off the

antifraud provisions.

They have a specific savings clausa for

fill federal remedies. And I’m suggesting that that feet that
this large group of people would find themselves without a
remedy for that wrong is not something Congress intended.
We feel, because of the scienter requirement, the

48

honest pension manager is shielded from any securities fraud
liability,,

And if that is not sufficient to reflect protection

of the pension industry, Senator Williams did introduce a bill
that would have the effect of reversing the Daniel case»
So if Congress doesn't like the upholding of this
decision, they have before them something they can vote on
that would reverse it.
Now, if all of these protections
QUBSTIONt

Well, conversely, a® suggested a few

minutes ago by the Chief Justice, if they don't like the
reversal of tills decision, they can also change fcha law.
MR. WALNERs

Absolutely.

If these protection© I've discussed so far as not
sufficient to alleviate any concern the Court may have about
the of feet on the industry, it is possible, of course, for the
Court to fashion different forms of prospective relief.
We don't believe prospective relief is appropriate
in this case, because of the allegation of intentional fraud.
And the need to prove intentional fraud to establish a causes
of action.
In the Manhart case,

in which this Court allowed

prospective reliaf, the reading indicates it was done so
because of the conscientious and intelligent administration of
the pension fund, and implicitly the good faith of the pension
fund administers «—> administrators.

49
We feel that if prospective relief is considered, it
should be fashioned so as not to deny relief against the
defendants in this case and in the consolidated case;, because
in the consolidated case — consolidated with this case in the
lower court — we do have the Central States Pension Fund as
a defendants

I am not asking for any relief based or?, guilt by

association, but I do feel that’s an important element t© have
before the Court»
Now, although the defendants have really acknowledge
in their briefs that we have the equities, we're not asking
for relief based on sympathy, but on well-grounded authority»
It's not th© unconscionable rule that we’re complaining about
in th© securities accounts that denied Mr® Daniel a pension,
that's not the gravamen of our complaint»

It’s the intentional

misstatement about his rights, the intentional misrepresenta­
tion»
In fact, fch® rule is so bad — just to comment on it
as an aside «-Mr* Daniel could not have gotten & pension under
the terras ©f his rejection if he had not missed a day in 22 and
a half years»

Because the rejection letter — we discuss it

in the footnotes in th© brief — the rejection letter says
that he's denied a pension for a six and a half or seven-month
break in service»
involuntary layoff»

He missed three and a half months for the
Th© question 1st What happened to th©

ether throe rnd a half months?

50

Th© other three and a half months resulted from a
nonpayment of the pension contribution by th© employer,
allegedly as a result of an embezzlement by his bookkeeper®
But the denial in the pension letter suggests that he still
would have had a three or three and a half month break, which
would have been disqualifying if he had never missed a single
day.
Now, in speaking about the fears of damage to the
Indus try, the Teamsters have really sought to masquerade as
being representative of the industry norm, in terna of thsir
plan, administration and advice to members, and they tried
to paint the picture to this Court that if they are found
to have securities fraud scienter in a lower court trial, th©
entire pension industry is doomed®
V?© want to tell you that's not: so®

In reporting a

study made by their own agent, the defendants reveal that in
a comparison with 32 other Teamster pension plane, Mr® Daniel
would have received a pension in all of them except the Local
705 pension plan® So they are not, in any respect, representa­
tive.

Dickstein’s argument with respect

He characterised the employees entering into employ­
ment as something about which the pension is incidental»

In

many cases the pension is the primary motive» There are many
examples of a person who will stay on a job that he doesn't
like, or not change jobs because he's expecting a pension
in the present job»

He may even forego a job with higher

pay, because, when you count up the benefits of the pension,
it amounts to more money»
There are employees who will stay in a job when
they are sick, when they are hurt, because they want to hang
on the last few years to get a pension.
Certainly in those cases the pension is the primary
consideration. And even for the new employee seeking a career
and deciding to make a choica between fields, ha can easily
discern the value of the pension to him in evaluating
comparative salaries, and he can easily compute that the
value of the pension will have a certain dollar benefit which
may be the decision-making factor in choosing between

MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr® Barack®

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. BARACK, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR® BARACKs

Mr® Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
This whole case revolves around the question of
how to characteris® the economic Interest in the Local 705
Pension Fund acquired by Mr® Daniel for value rendered®
Now, this economic interest is an interest in a
pool or fund of professionally managed investments, stocks,
bonds, mortgages and the like®
It is, in this nature, akin to a mutual fund or a
variable annuity. And, I might add, in answer to some of the
comments mad© by the counsel for the petitioners this morning,
that a variable annuity fund is also a fund, an interest in a
variable annuity is a security, and it's the type of security
which provides for the annuitant the payment in the future of
an annuity, as you will, a retirement benefit®
The economic interest here, as in VALIC or United
Benefit Life, was acquired in a periodic investment program
by the giving of services, involving the pooling and professional
management of other people's money to provide for a benefit,
profits if you will, at retirement in the form of an annuity®
QUESTIONS Well, we're concerned here with — despite
all the elaborate briefing and argument *— with two rather

57
precise and fairly technical questions, i,e., whether within
the meaning of the 1933 and 1934 Acts — and/or those two
statutes —» this interest is a security and, if so, if there
was a sale of it.
Those are precise statutory questions.

Hot — and

if you are talking about economic effects, you can be talking
about insurance or bank savings accounts, or lots of ■ other
things that are not covered by the Securities Act,
MR, BARACKs

Well, I think what we have

is a

situation where we're not writing on a clean slate, as the
Court has expressly recognized in Forman,

There are six

prior decisions interpreting the definition of investment
contract rendered by this Court,
In these six decisions, various points become clear,
which make it absolutely clear also that we have & security
here.

For example, the question has come up whether or not

the fact that this might be a novel form of investment means;
that it is not a security,
,

For example,
QUESTIONs

Well, lots of forms of investment are —

I mean, lots of them are not securities.

An insurance policy

is not a security, although it's a savings device, and it's
a pooling device,
MR, BARACK s
security.

However, a variable annuity plan is a

How, why is it a security?

It's a security because

58

it masts the elements of the Howey Rule.
Now, what are the elements of the Haway Rule?
Because this is a rule that has been reiterated by this Court
in Forman as defining what a security is.
Now, fch© Howey Rule states that you have to have an
entrusting of value or money to others to be managed with a
reasonable expectation of profits to be managed in a common
enterprise.
QUESTIONS Right there, Mr. Barack, on the entrusting,
how, what has the employee entrusted in order to acquire the
interest?
I was interested, Mr. Stillman read part of a
paragraph on page 14 of this document, but the paragraph starts
out, "A funded pension is ono which requires an employer to
make contributions while the employee-member works, instead
of after he retires„w
Tli© very paragraph he cites emphasizes the fact that
the investment in money is made by the employer rather than
the employee.
MR. r\IlACXt

Well, I would suggest that the reading

of the Howey Rule in order not to exalt form over substance,
in order to look at the economic realities involved, all you
need is investment of money or money’s worth.
Now, there has bean at least, I believe, one case, a
District Court case in Texas, SEC va Addison, which I think

59

is cited on page 54 of our brief, which indicates that an
investment of services would constitute -the necessary invest­
ment of value to meat the first prong of the Howey test.
QUESTIONi

But isn't it true -that in those cases,

if a person contributing the services were terminated for some
reason, after a year of work, he would still have soma interest
left, but here this mail was terminated, you have no interest
whatsoever»
MR. BARACK 5

That is a question that goes to the

issue of contingency, an issue already discussed»
What I would suggest, the inquiry is whether something
otherwise a security is declassified from the definition of
security because of the fact that it is contingent»

Now, I

suggest the example used by Mr» Walner, that a stock option
acquired by the giving of services, which option can only be
exercised after a number of years, is a security which is not
declassified from the definition of security because it is
contingent.
Lot ns look further.

In the Howey Rule, as reiterated

in Forman, what is stressed is that there must be & reasonable
expectation of profits.

Not that there be immediate profits

today or tomorrow or Year One or Year Two. All that is required
is that there foe a reasonable expectation of profits.
QUESTION* Well, if the plan ware never subject toamendment, say the defined benefits were always two dollars,

60

or whatever the payment was, it was never to be amended, would
you still be able to male© your argument?
MR® BARACK: Well, that is the question -QUESTION s

Is a continuing interest one that depends

on the Trustees amending the plan to increase the benefits,
provided there’s enough money fchsre that they can use to

MR® BARACK:

Because

here we have a situation where the lure to the investor was

actually tha profit element.

As Mr® Stillman has quoted from

their own brochure * it is tha money that is contributed that
is growing' which is the lure to the investor.
Mow* indeed* in this case the profits in the form
of retirement benefits promised to investors have increased.
QUESTION:

But you don’t read the whole paragraph*

that’s what 2 object to about both of you. They say that
there's enough money there so when it's invested you can be
sure that tha fund will grew so they can pay you the $250
monthly that’s provided under the plan.

They say there's

going to foe enough growth to meet the guaranteed benefits.
That's what they say®
MR0 BARACK:

Well* that’s —

you are getting this * and they also reiterate throughout
their descriptive materials* which have been distributed*
which we allege are materially misleading* that over the course
of the period of time these benefits have been increased.

62
md indeed 'this is just the facts here.

The profits promised

have increased from an initial $75 per month for persons
retiring in 1955, to $550 per month for persons retiring in
1977,
QUESTIONS

Will you tell us what caused that

How much of it, what percentage of it is from

investment efforts of the Trustees of the Fund, as distinguished
from additional contributions made by the employer as a result
of collective bargaining?
MR. BARACKs

Well, ws don't know the exact answer

to that question in terms of the numbers, but let me tell you
a number that we do know that is analogous to that. We do
know that by the defendants’ own computation, when there
has been an investment along the example they use of
approximately $9500 in the pension fund, that there will be
substantial profits returned to the investor, and of these
substantial profits approximately $5,000 would represent
earnings on that fund, or approximately 30 percent of the
amount invested.
Let’s look at it from another point of view. The
persons investing in this fund are investing $30 a weak, $1500
a year for over $30,000 in a twenty-year career.

If invested

risk-free, at 7.5 parcent in a savings bank, that would
amount to $72,000 over a twenty-year career.
potential is tremendous®

The profit

people to invest here»
QUESTIONS

When Mr. Daniel signed on and the

pension agreement was originally formulated to guarantee him
£240 or

$250 a month* as Justice Stevens questioned you

about, was there any promise that ha would get more than that

MR. BARACKs

This is an important question.

The

question that «- vie have to recognise that, the defendants have
conceded that a voluntary contributory plan, an interest in
such a plan is a security»

Now, they have appended a name to

64

our particular type of employee plans

involuntary and non»»

contributory®
Wall, what are they saying when they are saying that
a plan is involuntary?

They*re saying something about the

fact 'that either an employes who makes an employment decision
cannot also make an investment decision, or that an investment
decision undertaken by an employee is secondary to the
employment decision undertaken®
Well, itf$ certainly true, and -this- case has held,
that the presence of a security cannot

be defeated by the

fact that the transaction at issue involved other substantive
dimensions®

For example, this Court in UALIC, in United

gano;f;lt_ Life, has found a security, an investment contract
there present, even though the person there was acquiring
other elements of insurance®

sentence,
MR® BARACK*

Mr® Justice Powell thus stated in

United Benefit. Life that there are two promises involved that
ar© entirely distinct and may be separated from one another®
I think that

let ms just finally then conclude

that this type of security, which we have present hero, meets

65
the definition of investment contract, because Mr» Daniel
has turned over his retirement funds to others to bs managed
in a pooled investment program, on the promise of profits, and
that therefore it was within the intent of Congress to protect
against, by enacting the antifraud rules of the federal
securities laws»

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY DICKSTEIN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO» 77-753
"

MR® DICKSTEIN?

Mr» Barack, at the end of his

argument, said that we have conceded that an interest in a
voluntary contributory pension fund is a security,

I feel

like the man who gave up the tip of his finger and found that
his whole arm had. been swallowed up»
We have said it again and again and again, we said
it in our reply brief»

All that we do say, and this is

consistent with what the SEC has said, is that where you have

66

a plan where employer stock is purchased with employee money,
that is a security.

But nothing else is,

tod Mr, Stillman, and I think with candor, in answer
to your question, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, as to whether or not
the security *■»- inaction of the Securities and Exchange
Commission can in any way be attributed to their position with
regard to no sale, stated with 'candor that as a matter of
fact the SEC has taken no enforcement action whatever, even
with .respect to voluntary contributory plans,
And we believe that 35 years of quiescene, from ar.
agency which is hardly known for its passivity, speaks volumes,
There was another question asked of Mr, Barack,
and that was:

How much ©f this increase in pension benefits

from 75 to 550 represents increase in employer contribution?
Mr, Barack actually did have the figures and he
stated them, although in an

inadvertent way.

The initial

employer contribution to the 705 Fund were two dollars a week,
Mr, Barack says it’s now $30 & week.
During the period of time in which the pension
benefit, the defined benefit has gone from $75 to $550, an
increase of about sevenfold, the amount of contribution has
gone up 15 times,
I think this is really relevant.

Because it does

tend to deal with even the isolated factors in thia type of
arrangement, which Mr, Barack shows that under the Howey

6?
definition of a security demonstrates that this is a security,
About Howay* 1 think the first thing to say

is that

the formulation in that case was designed to ascertain
Congress’s intent with respect to the usa of tha word "security"0
Here w© think there are much better indicia of congressional
intent,
But even if there were not* and even if one looks at
the Howay formulation* we think it simply intends to reinforce
the proposition that when you're talking about pensions you
are outside of tha realm of the securities laws.
They say investment of money ia the first Howey
criteria or element* and 1 say* well* we have it here because
when the employer puts two dollars in th*? pension fund* that’s
the same as if he handed the two dollars to the employee and
tha employee handed it to the pension fund administrator and
said* "Put this away for my retirement15»
Well» this Court* of course* in Alabama Power* when
it considered the question of pensions* recognised that it
is by no means as simple as ihafc,

Thera are.all kinds of

reason® why employers have ponsion plans* and why employers
mak© contribution® to pension plane* including the humanitarian
as well as the good labor policy reason* that when an
employee is too old to work* he ought to have soma money in
his pocket as ha leaves the plant door,
A dollar in the pension fund* in. a noncontributory

60
pension plan is not fungible with a dollar purchase of a
mutual fund»

And, as a matter of fact, ERISA makes sharp

distinctions between contributory, be-tween employer dollars
end employee dollars, when the employee makes a contribution
to a pension plan it, by terms of ERISA, is nonforfeitable»
When the employer makes the contribution, of course it is
forfeitable, unless and until nesting is achieved»
They talk about the interest income»
really is it?

Whose income

In the simple modal of a single employer

pension plan, it*a quite clear that the interest income which
is earned on the money that that employer places in the fund
has to do with the level of funding and how much more the
employer has to put in in order to pay the defined benefit
provided by that plan»

X will not go into each of these factors in
Isolation, but whan one views them in Houey terms, one has
to conclude that they are all somewhat skewed *»«• and I think
I'm being charitable when I say "somewhat”

» because the

point is these elements cannot be viewed in isolation»
All of the other factors pertaining to noncontributory
pension plan®, the plaintiff and the SEC dismiss as irrele­
vancies »
Break in service, minimum periods of employment»
Who ever hoard cf a security where you get paid off if you're
disabled and you don't get paid off if you

quit your job?

69

We are talking about an aspect of employment,,
1 quite agree with Mr* Stillman «—
QUESTION:

But if you look at this thing in a

broad sense, as you’re suggesting now* do you suppose that
before vesting occurs an employee would have standing to
bring a lawsuit to challenge the administration of the Fund
by the Trustees?

Your figures suggest that the contributions

went up fifteenfold when benefits only went up seven or eight­
fold®
Now* would an employee have a standing to raise a
question about that?
MR® DxCKSTEINs

Certainly.

QUESTION: So he does have some interest in the Fund*
then?
MR. DICKSTEINi

In that sense* it’s just* X

suppose* like a contingent ramainder-man in an ordinary
trust9
QUESTION»

And whether or not it's —

MR. DICKSTEXDJs

**** might have the right to bring

a suit against the Trustee.
QUESTIONt

And the specific interest in it is

whether it’s as profitable as it ought to be.
MR. DICKSTEINs

No.

His interest* I suppose*

of

the employee* if the Trustees were acting as imprudent
trustees under ERISA or were embezzling funds* for example®

70

I think he would have a sufficient reason ~~
QUESTIONS

But if the embezzlement wouldn't

prejudice his expectancy of $250 a month or whatever the
benefit would be, what interest does he naves?
MR® DXCKSTEINs

In that sense he would have a

sufficient interest? in a security sense he does not have a
sufficient interest»

We're simply talking in a different-

area»
QUESTIONs
QUESTIONg

Yes.
Wellf forfeitability doesn’t mean it’s

not a security^ does it?

Because you cars have an agreement

of sale for land, and if you've got a bunch of orange groves
on it# it could conceivably come within the Howay-Joiner
rational® and still the contract might bn forfeited»
MR» DICKSTEINt

Thare is no single aspect which

perhaps by itself — you cannot find a situation in which
you would say there is a security»
But if you put it all together and you examine the
totality of the transaction; it’s clear that it’s not»
Mr® Stillman spoke about the six cases in which
this Court has dealt with the question of security» And from
Joiner in '43 to Foreman in ’75, it all comes down to this?
the test is, what character ’the instrument is given in
commerce»
