MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Gardner,, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE A. GARDNER, ESQ.
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GARDNER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the courts

Gonzales versus Young was

set in tandem argument with the Chapman case which immediately
preceded it.

I noted the Court’s questions and I would like

to address myself to them directly.
Mr. Justice Stevens and Mr. Justice White seem to
have some difficulty with an expansive intarpretion of the
"and laws" provisions in 1983.

I submit that that perception

is contrary to what Congress is all about when it enacted 1983.
1 submit further that that perception is contrary

to the wording of the statute.
Let me go back for a minute if I may.

In the period

1868 to 1871 the Federal government was faced with the situation
where several, states rights groups contended that notwithstanding
the Federal Constitution, the ultimate legal authority to
determine questions of Federal law reposed in the states.

This

was at a time when the Freedmen's Bureau Act was not being
enforced«
As a result of that situation, President Grant W®nt

before the Congress and effectively said, "The laws of the
Federal government are not being enforced»

Congress has to

act pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment."

In regard to that,

Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1871 which is the
precursor

of 1983 and 1343.
It was in point of fact Congressional concern about

non-enforcement of Federal rights by the direct inter-position
of state power that in fact was the focus of the entire juridi­
cal seoYianism

that we now know as 1983 and 1343.

Viewed in. that light, there is not one reason to
interpret 1983 in a restrictive manner.

In truth, to narrow.!se

1983 debases and banalizes' the entire Congressional problem
that was addressed in 1871.
We must keep in mind here that we are not asking
this Court to interpose its judicial power between private
parties nor between situations involving simply Federal law
and non-$10,Q00 questions.

What we are talking about here is

the federalistic antagonism between states and the Federal
government,
Let us for a minute just dwell on the facts of the —
QUESTION:

Did the 1871 statute have the words "and

laws" in it?
MR. GARDNER:
"constitution".

The 1871 statute only used the word

It was not until the amendment

"and laws" was included.

in 1874 that the

I do not believe that is significant

5
for the following reasons:
Number one* in 1871 Congress could only act pursuant
to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Accordingly, when

Congress spoke in 1871 of rights arising under the Constitution,
they were clearly referring both to the Constitution itself
and to the implementing legislation»
Number two, the Constitution through the Fourteenth
Amendment directed to the statas e£ necessity incorporates the
privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States.
From as long ago as the Slaughterhouse cases it has been made
clear that the rights of citizens of the United States spring
both from the Constitution ©ad from the Federal statute.
Number three, in point of fact, at the time that 1983
was enacted in 1871 solely with the Constitutional wording, it
took cognizance of the negation with the Supremacy Clause, which
in

fact spoke of the primacy of Federal law.
So what you had, Mr. Justice White, was in 1871

Congressional concern about both the Constitutional rights and
rights under Federal statutes.

And in point of fact, this

was made clear several years later,
QUESTION:

Rights under Federal statutes enforcing

the Cons titution.

MR. GARDNER:

Those rights, Mr. Justice White, would

include of necessity all rights under Federal law for the three
reasons that I mentioned.

6

Humber one, they would necessarily embrace 'the
privilege;- and immunities

of citizens of the United States*

Number two, they would embrace any substantive
statutes that ware passed by Congress pursuant to Section 5
of the Fourteenth Amendment.
ted number three* they would embrace the Supremacy
Clause, which itself embraces all Federal statutes.
QUESTION:

So I think -

Well, if you think that you do not need

the "and laws” language, you

have real trouble with Swift

versus Wickham, do you not?
MR. GARDNER:
language today.

I feel that we need the "and laws"

I feel that the lack of the 83and laws" language

for that three-year hiatus, that is,
QUESTION;

from 1871 to 1874 —

Under your view* you do hot need it in

your case?
MR. GARDNER:

Yes, you do not need it if you read

"and laws" as being redundant*

I do net read it necessarily

as being —
QUESTION:

Well, do you not read it as being redun­

dant?
MR. GARDNER:
it is redundant.

No, not necessarily.

I do not. think

What I am saying is that Congress at that

time included its concept of the Constitution — both Constitu­
tion and laws.

But I do not think it is redundant.

QUESTIONs

Well, do you rely on the "and laws" provision

7
in this case at all?
MR* GARDNER:

Yes, I do.

I rely on it to the extent

that ttxis case clearly deals with the Federal statutory right.
And in point in fact, I did not plead any other Constitutional
basis for jurisdiction and indeed that is precisely why the
case —
QUESTION:

Well, do you not plead the Supremacy

Clause claim?
MR. GARDNER:

Yes*

The Supremacy Clause claim is

of necessity included in the pleadings because it comes under
1343.
QUESTION:

If you are right about your Supremacy

Clause claim, what do you need '"and laws" about?
MR. GARDNER:

If I am right about my Supremacy Clause

claim, 2 do not need the “and laws".
QUESTION;

You have at least two alternative arguments?

MR. GARDNER:

I have two alternative arguments.

And what I am saying is

that there are three argu­

ments.
QUESTION;

But

if you are right about the one, the

"and laws” words are redundant?
MR. GARDNER:

Yes, that is correct.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in answer to your question about
Swift versus Wickham, I think that that case in fact supports
our position

In Swift you had the following problem:

As a result

of ex parte Young it was decided that the Federal courts could
interpose themselves and enjoin actions
This gave rise to a political situation.

by stats officials»
Under what circumstances

are the Federal courts to sit and enjoin state statutes?
In & sort

of compromised situation, there was enacted

a three-judge court procedure, which was enacted solely to
allay the state's fears that a single Federal District Court
judge would have the power to in a sense interpose himself
into the mechanism of state government.
How during the progeny, if you will, or the paradigm
of that legislation, we find that the Court carved out sever?*1
exceptions, and one of them was where there is a conflict
between Federal law and State law, the Court basically said,
'"This is not so uniquely a state problem; that states would
toe all that concerned about it and
to convene a three-judge court.

would require us in a sense

Rather this

is by its very

nature, i.a., by the existence of the Federal statute, a
Federal matter."

,

And accordingly, the Court said there is probably
not the same kind of state concern that would exist if we were
dealing solely with an isolated

state statute,

How I submit

that that rationale —
QUESTION:

I do not think I follow you there.

You

say that we are dealing only with a Federal statute, but you

9
are dealing with a Federal statute that is claimed to override
or preempt a state statute.
MR. GARDNERS

But what I am saying is that in the

cases under Swift, the exception to the convocation of the threejudge court occurred when you had both the Federal statute
and a state statute, as opposed to simply a state statute.
QUESTION:

Do you not have a Federal statute arid

a state statute here?
MR. GARDNERS

Yea, you do.

And I am saying that

there is not the same state concern in those situations.
that is precisely why this type of case is

And

redressable and

should be brought in Federal court.
What X am saying it does not upset at all the delicate
balance of federalism.

It is not as though the state court

was in a sense interposing itself again in matters of pure
State law.'

What you have is a subsuming Federal statute.

And

y

Which body is most geared to, if you will —* has the most
natural repository of experience with Federal law.

It is the

Federal courts,
I do not mind pointing out in terms of practicality
that as a Welfare attorney, when you go into a state court
and start asking at the outset for a Federal judge to interpret
a Federal statute, you run into very many difficulties.
Let me just cit© a few,

For instance, in the State

of New Jersey where I practice, you are often met with the

10
argument that Federal statute — that must mean that HE$ is
an indispensible party,
Federal agency.

We do not have jurisdiction over a

Go to Federal court.

That is in the Atchison

case which is in the Appendix to my brief,
QUESTION:

Those state courts nor you could give the

Federal court jurisdiction.
MR. GARDNER:

No.

I believe that Congress gave the

Federal courts jurisdiction.
QUESTIONs

No.

You are now saying that the State

courts of New Jersey give us jurisdiction.
MR. GARDNER:
to.

If I was saying

that; I did

not mean

What I was pointing out was that-I think that the state

courts^ in point of fact; view this case in the same way that
we are urging it should be viewed, and that is the repository
for the interpretation of the Federal statute should be the
Federal courts.

That is all I was trying to say,

QUESTION s

Now give me the decision of any court

that said that?
MR, GARDNER:

The name of the case is in the Appendix

to iay Petitioner8s brief.

It is Atchison versus the Departments

MR. GARDNER:

Yes, it is, Mr. Justice Marshall.

I

think that though the Federal courts have a certain experience

mechanisms.

And I think that in terms of Article 3, Section 2

of the Constitution, the Federal judiciary power clearly extends
to cases dealing both with the ~

My point is that you say that Federal

Now do you also think that State judges

No, 1 do not think that is the problem.

Because if you do, please join us on the

HR. GARDNERS

I think that that is sort

of like

placing me in somewhat of a bind.
QUESTION?

I am trying to get some reason other than

your theory that a Federal judge knows more Federal law

than

a State judge.
MR. GARDNER;

I think he does.

I think a Federal

judge does know more Federal law than a State judge.
QUESTION;

The day that he arrives on the bench?

MR. GARDNER:

No* certainly not.

there is the experiential level.

But X think that

And I think that that is not

that, of course* is not the juridical reason why this case
should be decided in favor of the petitioners.

I am merely

stating that that is a practical reason —
QUESTION:

Well* I am trying to urge you to get to

that point.
MR. GARDNER;

, *"
Yes.

X think that* in point of fact*

though the Federal judiciary is more equipped to interpret
Federal statutes.
In addition to the New Jersey problem that I mentioned*
you -have a problem* for instance* in Mississippi where there
is no right to go into State court on an appeal in one of these
types of situations.
So what X am saying is that there really is not
what might be termed a viable alternative to having a Federal

13
statute interpreted other than Federal court.

And I would ask

the Court that when they consider the language of this statute
of 1383 and 1343 to please keep that in mind, and to not act
as though well this is in some sense an academic exercise
unrelated to the realities of the practice,
QUESTION:

The Supremacy claim, you can always bring

it here if it is turned down by the State courts.
MR. GARDNERs
on an appeal.

That would be the only circumstance

That would be the only constitutional — but as

we argued in this case, we believe that the jurisdiction rests
even apart from the Supremacy, Mr, Justice Rahnquist, and that
would be through the interconnection of the 83and laws” clause
of 1933 and the Act of Congress providing for the protection
of equal rights in the Act, of Congress providing for -the
protection of civil rights.
So X think there are three alternative ways in which
jurisdiction could be interpreted here, and we feel that all
three of them are valuable and it would not justify our clients
to simply be forced to roly on each instance under 'an appeal
on the Supremacy Clause from the State Supreme Court, from the
Federal Supreme Court, particularly since you have in issue
Federal statutes.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought that you were saying really

there is not any alternative if in some areas — that you simply
cannot your Federal question adjudicated unless you ©re allowed

14
to have the jurisdiction in the Federal court»
MR. GARDNERS

Well, of course, at the present time

it is very, very difficult because some of the arising under­
cases have been interpreted to exclude for constitutional
reasons the Supremacy Clause»
only thing

And if in point in fact the

that we were left with in the constitutional sense,

that is the only thing that would give us a olear right of
action in terns

of an appeal to the United States Supreme

Court,was the Supremacy Clause issue,
,.But certainly,

it could fce difficult»

if we were trying to appeal to the

Supreme Court on the grounds of a conflict 1983, 1343 and laws,
wa have to go by cert, and as you can well imagine, that is
very difficult.

So again, I think that is a point.

.QUESTION?

Well, that is a burden that a lot of

litigants have to take.
MR. GARDNERS

No.

I understand that.

.And there is

certainly a mechanism and a reason for that, but I think that
nowhere will you find that you have a situation where you have
a direct Federal statute in conflict with the State statute, and
having a Federal court say we really do not have jurisdiction
over that»
1 mean, I believe in the case prior Mr, Justice
Stewart said, Well, when we are dealing with the Federal statute,
we are of necessity dealing with the question of Federal lav;.
This

is not, I urge you to remember, a $10,000

15
consideration — ia the $10,000 area Congress aaid this:

Sf

you have a right under a Federal statute, Congress may decide
to not

give jurisdiction for reasons of judicial administration

and the like.
That is a far different question than the delicate
balance of federalism which is subsumed in our case and that is,,
has Songress

ever indicated that it will not afford a citizen

of the United States a cause of action and jurisdiction in
Federal court when their depravation of the Federal right ie

by virtue of intervening State action»
X submit the Congress has not only not said that, but
has said exactly the contrary,

in 1J'83 and in 1343,

But let us move, if we will for a. minute, to an
argument that was touched on previously, 1343(4).
QUESTION»

Are you'through, Hr* Gardner, with your

discussion of 1343(3)?
MR* GARDNER:
QUESTION;

I am not through, no.

I am not

quite sure whether you take the

position that the words “and laws'1 in 1983 are broaut:* or
co-extensive than the words "by any Act of Congress providing
equal rights" in 1343(3)?

MR, GARDNERS

I categorically take the position that

they are broader and they have to be broader.
QUESTION;

So there is a gap between the two?

MR. GARDNER;

Well, I am saying that there is not a

16

gap if you read 51 providing tor the protection of civil rights”
as being co-extensive with 1983»

I do not think that gap exists*

I certainly think that the words “and laws'*’ in IS S3
embrace all Federal statutes»

Do you see that difference?

in saying "and laws" is broader than Act

So

of Congress providing

for the equal rights of citizens, I am not admitting to a gap
between

21343 and 1983 at all»
QUESTIONs

Because you say that part of tha function

©£ 1983 is to provide for equal rights of citizens»
additional functions

And it has

and those additional functions may be

the jurisdiction to perform those additional functions by
subparagraph (3)*
MR. GARDNER;

Yes.

Tt is somewhat the rationale

that was accepted in both Bass and in Gomes, and again it
tracks back to what Congress was all about in 1871 to twist
protection of Federal statutes.
I mean, it seems to me if at the bottom of this case,
if you accept the interpretation of my adversaries

you are

of necessity arriving at a conclusion that somehow Congress
back then was only interested in what might be called two
statutess

the Enforcement Act of 18S6 and the Civil Rights

Act off 1 believe, it was X870, which dealt with this question of
racial equality.
But I th^i.. again the history does not support thatbecause the Thirteenth Amendment dealt clearly with racial

17
equality? and .the Thirteenth amendment extended to private
parties.

It did not even need State action.

It was to any? if

you will — any depravation of rights because of racial
equality.

Now if we were here today with the Thirteenth

Amendment? okay? then I would not be able to argue the "and
laws® embraced ail Federal statutes.
But the game changed between 1866 and 1870 with th.e
Fourteenth Amendment.

And the problem -there was that they

wanted —~ Congress wanted Federal rights to be vindicated.

And

what they said was we will limit the breadth of our juridical
interests by saying it has got to be State action that interferes
with you? but with that limit? there are no other limits vis~a~
vis the nature of the rights,
QUESTION:

So you would say that whenever you have

a claim against the State agency or a person acting under
State law in which you assert a Federal basis for your claim?
you never need to inquire whether Congress intended to imply
a private cause of action?
MR. GARDNER:
with previous counsel.
“* as applied situation.

Yes,

And in point of fact? I disagree

I think that situation exists even in
I think there would be just simply

too much —
QUESTIONs

Wall then? civil rights is just surplusage?

MR. GARDNER?. Mr, Justice Marshall? civil rights is
in surplusage in 1343(3) and (4) because 1983 is the quintescence?

18
if you will, of the Civil Rights Act»

That is why it is not

surplusage .
QUESTION;

Then why is it there?

You say you do not

need it.
MR. GARDNER:

Yes# you still need 1983.

You never

need subparagraph (4) because there is jurisdiction under
subparagraph (3).

Yes# that is a wholly different issue.

If

you can view it is such an add-on jurisdictional conduit# but
that is not

necessary if

we get through 1343(3).

Rut I think it is very important if —
QUESTION:

But you need the phrase wAct of Congress

providing for equal rights of citizens0 in (3) or “Act of
Congress for providing for the protection of civil rights11 in
(4) in order to generically invoke 1983?
MR. GARDNER:

Correct# in order to invoke them for

purposes of jurisdiction.
QUESTIONs

And then when you invoke 1983, you see

eaactly what it says# and it says something beyond what its
genous would imply?
MR. GARDNER: Yes.

And as I think this Court noted

in the footnote in Lynch and I think Mr. -Justice Fortas# when
he was talking in price dealing with 241# the plain English
language says “and laws".

I mean it dees not restrict —- it

does not say every person by the constitution and laws providing
for the protection of civil rights.

19
And that is interesting because —
QUESTION;

Well? Congress never needed to add for

that?
MR. GARDNER;
QUESTION;

Pardon?

Congress never *— it was unnecessary for

Congress to add the section.
MR. GARDNER;

Exactly.

I think that Congress did not

have to if you accept my interpretation of (3).

If you do not

accept my interpretation of {3)t then, of course, from my
viewpoint Congress did need to.

And what is very interesting

about that question is that seems to be
QUESTION;

Well, if you do not accept your interpre­

tation of (3), then you cannot accept your interpretation of
(&) either in the sense that civil rights is not just an

automatic

reference to 1983.
MR., GARDNER;

Well, I think that that brings up a

whole different issue.

I do not agree with that statement.

I

think that your recent for non-acceptance of {3) might be that
— and I am just doing this arguendo — might be that it does
not satisfy the Equal Rights Bill.
But I think if it did not satisfy the equal rights
of (3), it clearly satisfies the civil rights of (4) for
a number of reasons;
Number one, Jones versus

Mayer back in 1972

a companion statuta dealing with the right of the purchase.

20
And I think that this Court just last terra indicated
very clearly that 1983 is in fact a civil rights act.

In

Moore versus County of Aisaeda# when 1988 was distinguished# the
Court specifically said 1988 is not an Act providing for the
protection of civil rights# unlike 1983.

In Rachel versus

Georgia when we were dealing with removal# the Court said the
precursor to the removal statute is. not an act providing for
the protection of civil rights like 1983.
So what we have is a litany of acceptance of the
proposition that 1933 is in point of fact# in point of syntax#
in point of history# an act providing for the protection of
civil rights.
So to that extent# fir. Justice Stewart# even if you
did not accept say argument under {3) for the reasons that it
does not flesh with equal rights# it would not follow that it
does not satisfy (4).

I only wanted to make clear that if you

accept my argument with (3)# it does not make much difference
for our purposes.
QUESTIONS

No# but your argument on (4) has the

same problem with it because you then have to say nand laws1
83 is broader than the civil rights issue.

in

So you get into the

same —

MR. GARDNERS
QUESTIONs
term set

Mr. Justice Stevens# both arguments --

Requires that 83and laws'5 be a broader

21
MR. GARDNER;

Exactly.

It is truly like, if you will#

tvjo issues with the same sub-issues.

You cannot get around the

"and laws", tout I say to you again that it does say "and laws".
QUESTIONs

Has any court ever adopted this line of

reasoning?
MR. GARDNER;

Yes.

I believe that Justice Learned

Hand in Borr.ar 'versus Keyes accepted this line of reasoning where
tiie problem was with a New York school teacher who went on jury
duty pursuant to a Federal statute and then lost her job and
brought an action under 1983 and 1343.

And if I recall in that

case# the court said that it is clear that these statutes were
meant to deal with Federal rights, Federal statutory rights.
So I think that there is support.

I also think that

in Ed elm an versus Jordan, Mr. Justice Rehnquist noted# that
it is somewhat clear that 1983 embraces Civil Rights Act under
example as provisions.
QUESTION:

Well, is it not one thing to say that 1983

embraces Civil Rights, in the sense that it creates a cause of
action for people who have been damaged by violation of some
substantive right created elsewhere?
MR. GARDNER;

But 1 think that the quote that I was

referring to embraces the Social Security Act.

In Edelman versus

Jordan the court noted that 1983 embraces the Social Security
Act under its "and laws" clause.
And I am saying that that rationale would support my

22
answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's request»
QUESTION:

To get back to your treatment of 1983,

does ifc necessarily follow that 1983 is itself a law protecting
civil rights?

Could not on® argue that it is simply an Act

which gives you a cause of action if some civil right created
elsewhere has been infringed?
MR, GARDNER:

I do not think it can be clearly argued

that way because that misperceives the entire rationale of this
court in examining Board versus.Flores,where it noted there
complementary germination.
And number two# the key wording of the statutes does
not reqiaire the creation of.

It talks about "secured by" and

"protection o£“ , which is of necessity 'what 1883 in the Four­
teenth Amendment was all about.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gardner, which case was it where we

said that civil rights included welfare?
MR. GARDNER:

In Edelman versus Jordan, I believe

that the Court indicated that the Social Security -—

You do not have to hold that specifically for me

to win on 1343(3).

If you want to make that by application

QUESTION;

But do you not have to do that to get

under 1983?
MR. GARDNER;

1983, if we satisfy the "and laws”, okay,

then all we would have to satisfy would 1343(3) or (4).

We

*

would not have to satisfy both.
QUESTION;

Well, 1983 is talking about civil rights.

MR. GARDNER;

1983 was talking about the depravation

of Federal rights.

The depravation of civil rights.

This

Court has said that about 80 million times.
MR. GARDNER:

It is generically a Civil Rights Act,

but it embraces the depravation of Federal rights by State

Well, do we not have to find that denial

of welfare is a denial of rights guaranteed by 1983?
MR. GARDNER;

You have to find that the Social Security

Act is in fact included within the phrase "and laws”.
all you have to find.

That is

You do not have to go any further and

characterize it.
QUESTIONs

You do not want to agree — 1983, you do

not want to agree to that?
MR. GARDNER;

You do not have to.

No, X do not agree with it.

I think

24
that you have to find that 1983 through its "and laws" conduit
embraces the Social Security Act.

I do not think you have

to go further and get into a characterization of welfare being

QUESTIONS

Before you sit down# do the court’s opinions

in the Rachel case or the Peacock case bear on this at all?
MR. GARDNER:

Rationale wise# not holding v?ise in the

Peacock case.
QUESTION:

They involve the removal statute# a

different statute.
MR. GARDNER;

Specifically# I think it is interesting

that in Rachel versus Georgia the court refused to expand
1443 to include & broad brush because they said Congress did
not do in 1443 what it did in 1983# which is really our
argument.
They said that Congress might have done it if they
had so chosen# but they did not do it.

And accordingly whan

Congress was dealing with this rather restrictive removal
mechanism# they limited it to rights guaranteed not by the
Fourteenth Amendment but by the Thirteenth Amendment# and you
are into the question of racial equality# which is really what
our adversaries are trying to do in this case — to try to
slide the entire Court into Rachel versus Georgia in a kind of
obscuring manner and say by the racial equality argument and
that is the end of it, because obviously the Social Security

Act does not

provide for racial equality»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SKILLMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SKILLMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the courts
I think it might be useful at the outset to note
the specific allegations of the complaint which bring these
jurisdictional issues before the Court today.

X note them

not because they are important to the disposition of the juris­
dictional issues as such, but because they may be useful just
by way of illustration.

In brief, the complaint alleges that the petitioner
was mugged after cashing her monthly Welfare and Social Security
checks and that, as a result, she was unable to pay her rent
or her gas and electric bill.
The complaint further alleged in rather general terms
that as a result of the inability to pay either of these bills
that the plaintiff was “within approximation of dispossession"
since she cannot pay her rent and "in imminent danger of having
her gas and electricity terminated.”
It

was further alleged that, despite these circum­

stances, the local welfare officials have refused to grant the
family emergency assistance.

26

Upon this position having been taken by the local
welfare official# the. complaint was filed directly in Federal
District Court based on these allegations# which claim# first,
that the denial violated the provisions of Federal law# the
same provisions recently interpreted by this Court last June
in Querr- v* Man&ley? and. secondly# that this action violated
the New Jersey regulations governing emergency assistance.
The critical part of those State regulations provide
that:

"When an actual state of homelessness exists or is

manifestly imminent# the County Welfare Board shall authorise
payment of the actual cost with adequate emergency care."

My

point is that it could not be said with certainty# at least
on the face of the complaint# that this case failed to satisfy
the governing State regulations.
tod despite the circumstance# a complaint was filed
directly in Federal District Court,

tod today we are confronted

with the rather difficult questions concerning the reach of
the jurisdictional sections of the 1871 Civil Rights Act in
this perspective.
QUESTION:

The merits of this controversy insofar

as the claim is a conflict between State and Federal law were
decided adversely to the complainant in Quern against Mandley#
were they not?
MR. SKILLMAN:

I would say they have been conclusively

adjudicated adversely to the petitioners# Your Honor# yes.

21
QUESTION;

In that case?

MR, SKILLMAN;
QUESTION;

I would say so,

You have another claim, of course, that

this violated Stats law itself?
HR. SKILLMAH:

Yes, there was that pending State claim

which — and I think that that claim is also frivolous at this
point, not ozi the face of the complaint, hut in light of the
affidavit that was

filed in a motion for summary judgment, it

is quite clear at this juncture that there is no substantial
pendant claim either.
Section 1343(3) is the primary jurisdictional section
that is relied upon by the petitioner as conferring jurisdiction
on the Federal District Court over this action.

This section

has two quite separate bases of jurisdiction.
The first is the depravation of any right, privilege
or immunity secured by the Constitution.
And the second is the depravation of any right,
privilege or immunity secured by any act of Congress providing
for equal rights of citizens,
The petitioner in two disjunctive arguments relies
upon both of these sub-provisions of 1343(3).

The Constitutional

Supremacy Clause argument relying upon the depravation of any
right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution is
in effect an argument that evrery time Congress enacts a new
statute, it creates a new right, privilege or immunity secured

2S
against depravation by State action through the Supremacy
Clause.
However, as the Third Circuit properly noted in its
opinion, when Congress enacts a statute creating rights, it
is that statute and not the Supremacy Clause that confers any
rights or privileges or immunities that the individual may claim.
Mow the Supremacy Clause becomes relevant if the State through
its legislative actions seeks to take action that will thwart
the operation of that Federal legislation — that is inconsistent
with that Federal legislation,,
Yet it remains the Federal legislation that confers
the right, that may be claimed by the particular individual.

So

on its face the ”secured by the Constitution” language just
does not apply.
Furthermore, if the Constitutional portion of 1343(3)
were read as broadly as urged by the petitioner, there would
be absolutely no need for the statutory part of this section.
District Court jurisdiction would extend to every State action
case based on any Federal statute and there would be no need
for Congress in 1343(3) to have gone ahead and also conferred
jurisdiction based upon a more limited class of Federal statutes
“providing for equal rights of citizens.”
In other words, the second part of 1343(3) would be
surplusad.,

It would be redundancy if the petitioner’s Supremacy

Clausa argument, were correct.

29
QUESTION:

But 1343(4) would not?

MR. SKILLM&N:

Well,1343(4) presents somewhat different

questions that I would like, if X may, address later on.
X think it is appropriate then to turn to the second
part of 1343(3) and X think that this also really gets to the
1343(4) argument as we11.
The critical language of 1343(3) is that there must
be an act of Congress "providing for equal rights."

Now we

think it is clear that neither the language of this provision
providing for equal righto, its historical origins in 1871, nor
its relationship to other jurisdictional sections, including
1331

,-

supports its use in & case claiming solely a violation

of the Federal Social Security Act.
QUESTION;

Well, that is not what they are claiming.

Would you think 1983 falls within that definition, an act of
Congress providing for equal rights?
MR. SKILLMANs

No, Your Honor, we think that 1983

provides a cause of action where you can find some other
legislation that provides the substantive cause of action.
QUESTION t

It itself is not an act of Congress pro­

viding for equal rights?
MR. SKILLMAN;
QUESTION:
you not?

Not by itself.

And you have to make that argument, do

You have to take that position and successfully

assert it in order for you to prevail, do you not, in this

30
branch of your argument?
MR. SKILLMAN;

I think that is certainly a critical

part of our argument, whether its acceptance is a pre-condition
to — it is certainly a critical part of oar argument, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Mr. Skiliman, right on that point, there

were some cases if I recall correctly in which jurisdiction
was predicated on a constitutional claim and then pendant to
the constitutional claim an attack was made on the State Welfare
Program of one kind of another, and jurisdiction was sustained
on the pendant jurisdiction theory.

So you did not even need

1343(3)=
Can you tell me what the statutory basis for the
Federal cause of action in those cases was?
MR. SKILLM&N %

Was it not 1983?

I think what the Court has done —

and without articulating any — in those cases is to imply
from the Social Security Act itself a cause of action in
Federal District Court for at least a declaratory judgment
which was what was issued in those cases.
There is no discussion about it in the cases and
1 think it is assumed that the pendant claim was one over
which there was a cause of action that could be pursued in
Federal Court.
QUESTION:

Do yoia think the Court has to disavow

those cases to sustain your position?
MR. SKILLMAN:

No, not at all.

31
QUESTION;

In other words, you concede there is

some kind of Federal cause of action hare, if not under 1983,
at least it is implied under the Social Security Act?
MR, SKILLMMf;

Well, I think that there i3 certainly

at this point a pretty long line of cases, which in the pendant
jurisdiction context have at least issued declaratory judgments
and have recognised a cause of action for declaratory judgment.
Whether or not damages, for example, would be appropriate in
that aaiae context is a different question, and 1 do not know
that that has ever been addressed.
QUESTION 3

But injunctive relief has been given in

soma of those cases, I believe,
MR. SKILLMAH:

I believe that not only declaratory

relief, but also injunctive relief, I believe, has been granted.
QUESTION s

But you say that the Federal basis for

the cause of action in those cases should not properly be
considered 1933, but should be considered an implied cause
of action predicated on the underlying statute, even though
the court never discussed it or analysed it?
MR, SKILIiM&N:
QUESTION?

I think that is correct.

I do not quite understand that.

If

“and laws" in 1983 covers all statutes, covers all Federal
statutes —■ do you need to say that?
MR. SKILLMMJi
that preposition.

But. we very strongly argue against

I mean, we think that “and laws'3 in 1983

32
must

be read in light of its companion jurisdictional statute,

1343(3), and not extend to every statute that has been enacted
by —
QUESTIONS

Well, first of all, you say that 1983 is

not an act of Congress providing for equal rights of citisens,
and is not an act of Congress providing for the protection of
civil rights, but that it is merely an act of Congress that
authorises the cause of action, based on something else?
MR. SKXLLMMis

Based on substantive rights found

elsewhere.
QUESTION;

And 1343, as everybody agrees, is no

more than a jurisdictional statute.
MR. SKILLMANs
QUESTION;

That is correct.

But that 1983 is — no more than authorises

a cause of action?
MR. SKILLMAMs
QUESTION s

That is correct.

That that cause of action must be based

upon something else?
MR. SKILLMANs
QUESTIONs

That is correct.

And that, therefor®, 1983 does not fall

within the definition of 1343(3) or (4)?
MR. SKILLMANs
QUESTION s

That is correct.

I want to be sure I have your position.

Do you say the words '’and laws" in 1983 are — have the same
limitation as the words in 1343.(3)?

33
ME. SKILLMMf;

Yes.

They were originally enacted

at the same time,
QUESTION;

X understand that.

If you say that, you

really do not have to say that .1983 is only an authorization
for cause of action?

You really have two alternative arguments?

MR. SKIELMAN;

That is correct..

That is the reason

I said in response to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question that I
thought it was a critical part of our argument, but not necessarily
a pre-condition.
QUESTION %

But if you are right in either respect ,

you prevail?
MR. SKILLMM?;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Did Rosado versus Wyman articulate the

basis for jurisdiction over the statutory claim?
MR. SKILLMMJ;

I do not believe so.

I think that

it spent some amount of time on the question whether or not
the pendant statutory claim could survive once the constitutional
issue had been mooted by the changes in New York’s practices,
but I do not know that it ever articulated where the cause of
action came from.
If it did. Your Honor, I missed it on reading the
case and I do not believe that it has.
I think that the critical way out of what has been
described in this case as a circularity, 'whether you start with
1343(3) and read the ’’and laws®

provision of 1983 in terms of

34

providing for equal rights oi the provision of 1343{3) or
whether you start the other way and read "and laws” as in some
way expanding the language of 1343(3} is to look to the
historical basis of the statute as first enacted in 18?!.
At that time, the focus, the intention was certainly
to provide a mechanism for th© enforcement of the Thirteenth
and the Fourteenth Amendment.

And both the Thirteenth and

Fourteenth Amendment had conferred power upon Congress to
enact legislation that would implement those rights created by
and recognised by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment.
And 1 think that the common assumption in 1871 was
that there was to be considerable Congressional activity in
implementation of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.
And that, through the Reconstruction Period, did not come to
pass.

There was not the amount of legislation that would have

been expected in 1871, but the question is s

Why add the words

08and laws* and what was meant by the term "and laws” in 198*?
It was predicated on, the assumption that the Thirteenth
and Fourteenth Amendments would be implemented through sig­

And we submit that 1983

of this historical context in which

it was enacted, as well as in light of the providing for equal
rights language of 1343(3) which both we and the petitioners
agree were complementary provisions.
QUESTION:

So you would not go so far as to say that

foe fairly said to enforce some constitutional provision, since
they have to be enforcing the Civil War Amendments?

But (4) is a. bit of a mystery.

I think when that

QUESTIONS

Do you think to have cause of action —

to have jurisdiction under 1343(4), do you agree that you must
refer in the first place to 1983?

Is that the statute which

satisfies "the authorised by lav?” requirement?
MR. SKILLMANs

Well, if your question is;

Is there

any other statute besides 1983 which also might service that
function, I do not know.

I do not know of any, but I cannot

say categorically that there is not any.
QUESTIONs

-So you think that any action under 1343(4)

must involve State action?
MR. SKILLMANs

That is a good question.

QUESTION;

Well, if you require 1983, it does, does it

not?
MR. SKILLMAN;

Yes.

But if it were possible to

imply a cause of action from some other Federal civil rights*
statute that was not dependent on State action, then there would
be some room for 1343(4) to operate*
abstract.

I am. speaking in the

I cannot identify the statute.
I do think though that in the legislative history of

the 57 Civil Rights Act that there were initially substantive
provisions that were drafted, that did not make their way into
the final Bill.

So that I think that 1343(4) may have been

intended to clearly establish jurisdiction to eliminate any
possible questions as to 1343(3) applying to new substantive
provisions that did not find their way into the eventual
legislation.
It is a very shrouded kind of legislative history.
I would like to make one final point, if I may.

The

argument is made and it is made primarily by the Respondents
in the Texas case argued previously that providing for equal
rights language of 1343(3) should be given a very expansive
reading because this is 'desirable as a matter of policy that
somehow Federal courts are better able to deal with Federal
questions than State courts.
And the suggestion is that in practical effect this
kind of an expansive reading of 1343(3) would have the same

3?
effect as deleting the jurisdictional amount requirement of
1331 with respect to cases in which the State is a defendant.
X think there are significant differences though between
proposals that have been before Congress to delete the juris­
dictional amount requirement of 1331 and what would be the
practical effect of accepting the petitioner's arguments as
to 1343(3).
First, there is the point that we discussed pre­
viously that the 1331 leaves open the question of implying
a causa of action from some other Federal statute, and in
implying the cause of action from some other Federal statute,
ouch as the Social Security Act, it is possible to imply a
right to secure declaratory or injunctive relief, and at the
same time not to imply a cause of action for money damages,
such as would be recognised under 1343(3) and 1983.
Secondly, the law under 1983 has evolved, such that
there is a very limited room, if any, for the operation of
the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.

This

Court noted in Gibson v. Berryhill that that issue was not
one that is closed? that there may still be some circumstances
under which exhaustion administrative remedies may be required
in 1983 actions, but at the present time — and it dealt with
at least by many of the lower Federal courts the doctrine is
practically non-existent in a .1983 case.
What that would mean as a practical matter is that

3 fi
if you accept the petitioner's argument, any Welfare case
in which the cause of action is pleaded as being predicated on
Federal law could be brought in Federal District Court* even
if ultimately it turns out that the issues are essentially
factual and that they are capable of resolution in terms solely
of State law.
And I take this case, at least on the face of the
complaint* as an example.

It may have turned out at seme

later stage that significant issues as to conflict between
Federal and State law* Quern v. Mandley* emerged* but on the
face of the complaint and on the face of the Jersey regulations
this might have bean a case where the $163 in Welfare benefits*
which was what was in issue* could have been resolved very
easily within the State Welfare administrative mechanism,
QUESTION:

And that would apply to the whole class?

MR. SKILLMMJ;

Well* the possible existence of a

class is something that, X think* only emerged at soma point
beyond the face of the complaint* Your Honor.

But it would

be a possibility for at least a sub-portion of that class* I
think is what I am saying.
Ultimately* it may have turned out that there were
some and in fact we now know that there were some petitioners
who would not qualify for benefits under the Jersey regulation
that might have qualified for benefits under the Federal statute*
if this Court’s decision in Quara v. Mandley had come out the

3S
other way.
But as to this particular petitioner and some other
part of the sub-class# they may have been able to receive
their emergency assistance benefits quickly and without regard
to the ultimate resolution of that conflict issue in Quern v.
Mandley.
lead my point is that this overly-eacpansive reading
of 1983 and 1343(3) urged by the petitioners with its concomitant# generally prevailing rule of no requirement of exhaustion
of administrative remedies would preclude resort to the simpler
and easier means of disposing of many such controversies.
Thank you.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Skiliman, before you sit down, in

Sdelman against Jordan on page 675 the Court said: "It is#
of course# true that Rosado against Wyman# 397 U. S. 397# held
that suits in Federal Court under Section 1983 are proper to
secure compliance with the provisions of the Social Security
Act on the part of the participating states."

“It is, of course,

true that Rosado against Wyman held that suits in Federal Court
under Section 1983 are proper to secure compliance with the
provisions of the Social Security Act on the part of par­

How I assume the Social Security Acts are not equal
rights statutes.

Therefore, if this statement is true, and

if 1983 provides the cause of action for welfare claims against
the State, necessarily the court is here saying that the words
“and laws" in 1983 are broader than the act of Congress providing
for equal rights.
