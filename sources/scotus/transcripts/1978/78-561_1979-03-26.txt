Mr. Shapiro, I think you may proceed whenever you

ORAL ARGUMENT OP STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court :
This case is here on the government's petition for
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit.

The Eighth Circuit set aside the District

Court ' s judgment which h..LU convicted the respondent on eirht
counts of securities fraud under

17(a)(l) of the

Securities Act of 1933.
The question presented in this case is
section 17(n)(l) prohibits frauds pructiced by customern on
their brokers
securities.

durinr. the course of offering or selling
We contend

section 17(a)(l) applies to all

fraud occurring during the process of offering or selling,
including those fraudo that injure brokerage houses.
The facto of this case can be sunnnarized rather
briefly.

In J1ly and August 1969, the respondent placed

sell o.·dcrs with fiv

different brokerage houses.

Those

orders in each uase were for lurr.e blocks of ei t.her 500 or

lj

1 , 000 shares of securities.

The respondent had cash accounts

with each of these firms and was not permitted to make short
sales .

In each of the sal es, he'either stated affirmatively

tha t his pos i t ion was lonR or he used words or phrases which
would indicate that his position was long.

In fact, however,

r espondent did not own any of the stock that he sold.

His

posi tion wa s short rather than long, contrary to hie repres entat i on .
· He planned to buy the stock at some later point in
time in the
to the

market and to make a delayed delivery
houses.

His profit would be the differerce

between the price at which he originally sold and the price
at which he later covered.

But contrary to his cxpectntions,

the price of all of these

went up subst.ntially

and he was unable to r.'ake

purchaS-'"'S and for th t

reason he never del:!Nered any of the> stock that he sold.
Undet· the SEC' s rules the brokers were required to
cover for respondent's sales.

At first when they were still

expecting hin to malte delivery, they forwarded the
securities on his behalf.

llhen he later confessed to the

details of this scheme, the brokers were required to buy in
the stock at their own expense,

in substantial

losses.
Due to respondent's deception, the risk inherent in
the short selling scheme uas shifted from himself to the

5

brokers.

Because they believed he was selling long, none of

them obtained a margin deposit that would have protected
them against the failure to make delivery on hie part.

The

Di strict Court found that respondent's misrepresentations
violated section 17(a)(l) of the statute and convicted him on
all eight counts of the indictment.

The Court of Appeals

agreed that the respondent had committed fraud and had injured the brokerage houses, but it concluded that section
17(a)(l) is not violated by the species of fraud which was
practiced against brokers rather than purchasers of securities and on that theory the court reversed respondent's conviction on all of the counts of the indictment.
We contend that section 17(a)(l) applies to the
species of fraud used here and we rely on the text of the
statute in ma'c1nr, that contention.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, could this case have been

prosecuted und r the '34 Act?

HAPIRO:

It could indeed, Your Honor.

think the most Jor,ical choice for this prosecution was

We

(i

17(a)(l).

A fraud was used in an offer and in a sale and as

the Blue Chips Stamp opinion points out, section lO(b) does
not explicitly extend to frauds in an offer .

The indict

here charged fraud in both the offer and the sale process
and for that reason section 17(a) was the logical choice.
17 (a) is the traditional criminal lat1 provision used in
prosecutions based on fraudulent selling schemes.

It is used

in by far the larger part of the cases raising frauds in
this particular context.
Now, the respondent admittedly committed fraud by
making statenents of the following kind:
shares at marlcet.

sell long 1,000

When he made that statement, he was short

rather than lonr, and we say that this misrepresentation
occurred in a sale because it was made by the seller at the
very time that he placed the sale.

The seller told a lie 1n

the very same communication that trirgcred the contract of
sale.

The def 1.nitions 1n the statute make that concluo1on

emph11tlc.
The

tatute says that a sale includes every d1oposi-

tion of a security for value, and the dictionary definition
or disposition 1s simply the action of getting rid of somethinF, or

with

Now, giving these wordo

their ordin·1ry m aninp;, the respondent committed fraud in the
disposition of securities when he placed fraudulent orders to
sell those sec ritieo.

The definition of offer contained in

7
the statute is even more expansive than the definition
sale.

or

An offer includes every attempt to dispose of a se-

curity for value.
Now, when respondent called his brokers and ordered
them to sell at market, he was obviously attempting to dispose of securities.

And since this fl'aud occurred while he

made that attempt to sell, we say that the fraud occurred in
his offer and a violation of the statute resulted.
QUESTION:

The District Court so found and the Court

of Appeals intimated that it ap;reed on the factual issuP,
didn't it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct, Your Honor.

strictly a question of the ncope of section 17(a)(l).

MR. SHAPIRO:

A few more thoughts about the literal text of the

clase of victims.

Section 17(a)(l) nowhere lim1tc the

It extcndA to any scheme to defraud, like

the mail fraud statute, which is the basis for section
17(a)(l), the victim can he anyone.

Indeed, the case law

makes it clear that there doesn't have to be any victim at
all.

The scheme to defraud io itself 1lleRal if it is prac-

ticed in the protected medium, th3t 1o the process of offerinp; or sellinp; a security.

And the statute does not say th t

8

the fraud must occur in a particular phase of the sale or in
a particular phase of the offer.

The sale transaction, of

course, consists of a series of events.

There is the order

to sell, there is the execution, there is the confirmation,
and in the ordinary course there is the delivery of
securities and the

of money.

But the statute does

not say that the fraud must occur at a particular point in
this process, and it certainly does not say that it must extend all the way from the seller

the anonymous ex-

change process to the purchaser on the other side of the
transaction.
The common sense of our position is illustrated I
think by a sinr,le example.

If a broker acting merely as an

ap,ent col!11llitted a fraud on a customer in the process of selling, no one would doi..bt that that was a fra"d 'n a sale
within the prohibition of the statute.

And we say that it

the fraud is the same.

The locus or

It still occurs in the sale process,

and we submit that there is no basis for the conclusion that
firms

as tntermediaries in the sale

process are not subject to the protections as well as the
prohibitions of

oection 17(a)(l).

The Court of Appeals nonetheless believe that it
was proper to narrowly construe seotion l7(a)(l)·because of

Q

its view of legislative intent.

The court thought that

Congress' sole purpose in enacting this statute was to protect investors.

We submit that that ignores numerous state-

ments of legislative intent to the contrary and it ignores
the economic problem that Congress was attempting to grapple
with in 1933.

This

was passed in the depths of the

depression as a meano to revitalize the economy.

The market

crash of '29 had left many investoro penniless and had practically wrecked many American busineso firms, in the words of
the Congressnen who debated thin provision.

We think that the literal

terma of the statute directly support our analysis, but for
the aa!ce of th• completeness -QUES 'ION:

I realize the Court of Appeals took a

diff rent view.
MR. '111AP.l.RO:

That' o co1•rect, the Court of Appeals

felt that the legislative hlstory pointed the other way and
we would like to point out it is supportive of our position.
Cong ens intended to eliminate securitieo fraud in order to

10

remedy the economic conditiono that it pointed to in the debates on this measure.

The beneficiaries of that prohibition

were explicitly identified as follows, and I quote from the
Senate report:

"The purpose of this bill is to protect the

investinp; public and honest business."

The House report

stated that business injury was equally as significant as
the loss suffered by investors.

In uhort, Congress was trying

to protect the national economy overall, including both
public investors and the business firms that participated in
our nation's economy.

There ia not n hint in any of the de-

bates or the reports that Conp;ress intended to protect investors only or that it was unconcerned with injuries suffered
by investors

or by business firms.

The respondent's citation of legislative history
showing that Congress intended to protect investors is ouite
beside the point, we respectfully oubmit. We would be the
first to

that Congress intended to protect !nvestors,

but we deny tha1: that was tho only purpose and respondent
cites nothinp; that sugp;e3ts that it was.
In recent secu1•itif!B cases, such as Hochfelder and
Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor D1 ur; Storeo, this Court has con1

trasted the Et'l.tutory provision under consideration with other
neighboring provisions to p,ct a clear view on its covernp;e
or its acope.

technique is helpful here.

Section 17(a) conta1n11 three separate subd1vi11ic.ns.

11
They are each e;{pressed 1n the d1sJunct1ve and each 1s a proh1bit1on

fraudulent conduct.

Section l7(a)(l) is the

broadest provision, forbidd1ng any fraud in an offer or in a
sale.

Section 17(a)(3), in contrast, is a more limited pro-

vis1on, dealing narrowly with fraud practiced on purchasera
of securities .

This difference shows that when Congress

inte1ded to cover purchaser fraud, it knew how to do so explicitly and it did do so explicitly.
This Court's decision in the case of United States
v. Gilliland, which we have cited 1n our opening and repll
briefs, demonstrates the proper analysis of this question.
In that case, the Court considered a provision in the Crininal
Code which prohibited the filing of any false report with a
government agency.

In the snmc a.ntence, and stated in

or bill or voucher

money from the government.

Th

defendant there made the same ary,umenc that the defendant
makes here, that the general prohibition should be c1rcumscr1bed by the narrower p••ohib1t1on.

Th1s Court rejected that

argument in wo1'ds that are directly applicable here, and r
quote:

"The rule ejusdem generis is a familiar and useful

of afford1ng added safegu.irdo. 11

That principle, we submit,

12

Section 17(n)(l) and 17(n)(3) are alternative prohibitions which taken together provide comprehensive protection against fraud, and there is no Justification we submit
for contracting these complimentary provisions into a single
narrow prohibition dealing only with fraud on purchasers.

He contends, however,

that the prosecutor made a mistake, that the prosecutor was
duty-bound to pursue him under section 10 of the '34 Act,
rather than sec1:ion 17 of the '33 Aot.

But as I mentioned

previously to Ill'. Justice Blackmun, 17(a)(l) was not only nn

is quite common place for a complex criminal

scheme to run afoul of different statutory provisions, and

this Court .

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOE A. WALTERS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. WALTERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
When this case first came before this Court. the
government stated in its petition for certiorari that the decision of the Court of Appeals seriously impairs the ability
of the United State

Secw.•ities and Exchange Commis-

sion to enforce the securities laws in cases 1nvolv1np; fraud
practiced on the largest oarticipantu in the national
ttes markets.
They also stated at pap;e 12 of their pertition for
cert.lorari that because 17(a)(l) authorizes not only or1m1nal
prosecutions but also civil remedies, the effect of the decision here is to abolish one of the government's most
effective weapons ap;ainst the most serious forms of securities
fraud practiced on r.1embers of the brokerage industry.
the tire we r,ot throup;h briefing this matter, on
reply brief the governm nt says the fact that

And by
8 of the

15
conduct may have violated other provisions of the federal
securities laws in addition to 17(a)(l) is not material.
And counsel stands up today and says that the conduct of this respondent violates lO(a), violates lO(b),
Violates the mail fraud statute, and I might say today vlolates
section 7 of the 1934 Exchange Act in connection with 7(c).
Now, having gotten into this Court -What difference does this make to the
central issue, Mr, Walters?
MR. WALTERS:

I

it mnkes this difference,

Your Honor, as to t1hether or not this case would be before
this Court here today.

This is the first time in over for·ty-

fi ve years of the administration of the Securities Act of 1933
that anyone ha, ever b<:?en 1nd1.ctctl in connc>ction with \lhat is
call d a short uclling schemr, and we maintain that there are
plenty of laws nvailQble in order to corral this kind of
activity and

this respondent wna not properly charp;ed.

QUEST .. ON:

The only issue beCore us is whether te

is properly charged under 17(a)(l).
HR. HALTERS:

That is correct, Your Honor, now that

we arc here, thnt in the issue.

And t think in determ1t1irr;

that issue we nhoulcl rcmcmbe1• that the Court or Appeals aa id
that this respondent was not guilty of a violation of
17(a)(l) because of the species of fraurl practiced by the
respondent, and I think that is a very important obocrvat1on.

16
What is the species of fraud practiced by the respondent?

They say it is short sell, nnd they say it is de-

frauding the broker in that the respondent lied to him and
misrepresented that he had stock to oell that he didn't then
own.

But the species of fraud really is the obtaining of

illegal credit which when you are dealing #1th securities on
the national securities exchanges is rep,ulated by oection 7
of the Exchange Act of 1934 .
QUESTIOH:

Well, Mr. Walters,

does it make any

difference which nepecies of fraud,n ne you put it, he
in when l7(a)(l) makes criminal the employment of any device,
sche,ne, or artifice to defraud?
MR. WALTERS:

It is our contention that the 1933 Act

was directed touards the purchaser of securities, that 1t
dealt 11ith the off r or the sale of securities to the purchnsere.

It dealt with the dictribution of securities in the

marketplace.

It dcult ''11th the offe1•ing of secut•itico in the

marketplace.

Wheren.s, the 1934 Secu1•itics Act dealt with the

tr no:i.ctional situations in the marketplace, 11hat was happening on the stock cxchflnges.

And ao oome of the debate in the

legiBlat"lve hiotory of thu 1933 Act indicates, there was some
disaopointment on the part of some of the members of the
House of Repreacntativeo f;hat the 1933 Act did not outlat1
tran3actional thinp,e ouch as short selling, selling against
tho box, washed sales.

But they stated that they realized you

17
couldn't do it all in one act, therefore the 1934 Act took
care of transactions.
Now, what did the '34 Act do?
short selling.

It did not outlaw

As one or the witnesses testified in this

case, short selling is a common practice .

Often the exchanp,e,

in dealing with the third market securities, the same securities that are traded on the exchange, if they are traded off
of the exchange short selling is commonly done, it is a part
of business, but -QUESTION:

But your client wasn't convicted of

short selling, he was convicted of fraud.
MR. WALTERS:

He was convicted of a

of fraud

and I am directing the Court's attention to what is the fraud
that he committed.

This is not ft•aud.

He did something.

The fraud that he committed that the law said he shouldn't do
was to get an cxtenslon of credit.

He obtained an illegal

extension of credit from 1;he brokers.
It wasn't short selling.

That is what he die:.

That is not illegal.

ing 11ith funr;ible commodities here.

We are deal-

Short sellinr, is occl.'.rr-

ing all the t•me.
QUEST·:oN:

You concede that he did engage in fraud?

MR. WALTERS:

I concede that he enp;aged in frauc in

obtainlne; and i:,ler;al extension of c1•edit, and I say that
that is in violation of the •34 Act and that it is not encompassed within section 17(a) of the 1933 Act •. And I direct

18

this Court's attention to the fact that we are dealing with a
transaction that involves the exchange mechanism, that involves the very thing that the 1934 Act was passed to regulate,
whereas the 1933 Act provisions were there for the purposes
of regulating the distribution of securities.
Now, as the facts indicate, not one investor in any
way was injured as a result of the transactions.

The illegal

extension of credit was in effect what the court found to be
the specie of fraud, as they stated that the respondent took
a free ride on the broker's noney or credit and in so do1r.g
violated the '311 Act.

So consequently in dealing with the

particular problem that we have here, I believe that the Court
of Appeals cor1•ftctly analyzed what species of fraud was tt:at

other, recognl

MR. WALTERS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Statutory --

MR . WALTERS:

I maintain that under the ' 33 Act that

the deceit on the purchaser

be read into subdivision

(1) and subdivision (2) and subdivision (3) and I point out
t hat i f you look at section 12 and you look at section 11 of
the ' 33 Act , you will find it is only the purchaser that has
standing to bring a cause of action for fraud, deception er
anythi ng in violation of the 1933 Act.

And I believe that

that is an indicat1or that that should be carried forth in
17 (a) provision, that it is really the fraud on the purcataer
in connection with a sale that 1s governed by this
section, and we have

that in our brier. that you 9tould

re-read into 1t.
Now, counocl hao made the observation that the basis

And I still say that

is i n keeping, t;hnt 17(a) is still limited to frauds and

21

violations insofar as they direct ito conduct towards the
purchaser.

And the conduct that the respondent here was in-

volved in was not directed to the purchaser at all, it was
directed in fact to the broker by way of obtaining illegal
credit in violation of law, and that law was the 1934 Act and
so if there was a violation that is whcrc--..this man should

Now, before closing I woulcl like to point out to the
Court a statement made by the government in its reply brief
as

effort to overcome the fact that there was an offer made

which the court found to be in violation of the la' , and I
refer the Court to page 3 of the governnent'a reply brief, and

22

it is footnote number three, in which the government does not
agree with the statement that we made on page 18, footnote 31
of our brief, in which we

the observation that the

District Court found only fraud in the sale of securities,
The Court of Appeals found fraud in neither offer nor sale,
and offer and sale, of course, are distinct acts.
Then the government in its reply brief comes back
and says that we are mistaken because of the fact that the
District Court specifically found that as to each count of
the indictment the defendant acted as charged, and what I want
to point out is that the findings of the trial
appe.ar on par;e 28 of the pet1tlon fol' writ of certiorari, says,
as to each co•Jn1; of the indictment, the court finds that the

What the trial col.ll't

ORAL ARGU!•1ENT OF STEPHEN

SHAPIRO, ESQ.•

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHAPIRO:

REBUTTAL

Just briefly, Your Honor.

I think the last sentence in the District Court's
opinion bears mention.

It says that the court finds the

defendant guilty of each count in the indictment and each
count of the indictment explicitly charged fraud in an offer
and fraud in a oale.
The statutory definition of an offer is simply an
attempt to dispose of a security for value.
ehow.d that there was an attempt.

The evidence here

That was the only purpose

of calling the broker and telling h1N to sell the shares.

We

think that thio finding or the D1ntrict Court is sufficient
to establish that there was fraud used in an offer as well as
a sale.

Mr. Shapiro, it is true, is it not, that
if you read Ju1ge Larson'o op1n1on, he does refer to snle 1n
each paragraph, and

next to concluding paragraph says

they prove beyond a reasonabl

doubt that -- I have lost the

now, but he r fern to fraud 1n the sale of securities
and never mentions offer in
MR. 'l!IAPIRO:
QUF.S 'ION:

rr.any words.

That's correct, Your Honor.

So he clearly found fraud in the sale and

that maybe also offer, but it is not nea1•ly

24
as clear.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is quite correct.

He paraphrased

the stat ute in terms of a completed sale, but in the proc.ess
of making a completed sale there was an attempt to dispose of
the security and we think that that is necessarily embraced
within this finding.
QUESTION:

And in all events, doesn ' t the question

whether it is an offer or not simply become a question of
law?
MR . SHAPIRO:

It certainly is, and this Court could

affirm or reinstate a correct Diotr1ot Court judgment on any
applicable legal theory.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, Mr. Walters just before he

sat down callej our nttention to •he finding under parar,raph
11 by Judge Lar on, oaying that no to each count of the indict

the court finds that the defendant acted as charged

in the count willfully and knowingly.
that last phras

What do you suppose

t1cnns?

MR. 'HIAPIRO:
QUES ION:

llillfully and knowingly?

Yes.

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is neceosary to sustain a con-

victlon under I bel,eve it is section 24 of the Act that
requires scienta nnd tint was the re son for stating that

QUESTION:

And as to each count of the

MR. SHAPIRO:

Including the offer as well as the sele?

MR . SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

I believe that it was, Your Honor.
I think that is correct .

The indictment appears on page 14

each count of the indictment.

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, tell me again -- I think you

covered it in your initial argument -- if you lose this caoe,
how will the commission's operations be hurt or crippled?
MR. SHAPIRO:

There is a p1•actical consequence to

the choice between 17(a) and section lO(b).

17(a) covers

fraud in an offer as well as fraud in a sale.
doesn't extend that far.

Section lO(b)

For example, a fraud was used here

in placing a limit 01•der or a atop loRs order that wasn't
executed on the exchange.

It couldn't be effected on the

exchange, and deception was used in that attempt to d1spoce
of a security, that would v:olate section 17(a) but it
wouldn't vioalto section lO(b).
QUESTION:

Well, is that quite clear, Mr. Shapiro?

The Blue Chip case holds that only a purchaser or seller
sue for damages.

But is it perfectly clear that on

n

y

i

there is an injury ton p1rchascr or seller is the statute
v1olated?

It ia quite a different question.

I didn't mean to suggest that.
