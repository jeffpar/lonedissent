MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will next hear argu­

ment in 78-511, Lo-Ji Sales, Inc, v. New York,
Mr. Berkman, I think you may proceed now whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD A, BERKMAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, BERKMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There are a. multitude of reasons why the searches
and seizures in this case are constitutionally tainted.

Any

one of them ought to be sufficient to require a reversal of
the conviction below.
First of all, the warrant under which the search
was conducted was invalid both because it was issued without
probable cause and because it failed to identify with par­
ticularity the items which were to be seized.
Second of all, the search was an exploratory limit­
less general search.

Third, the magistrate failed to focus

searchingly on the obscenity of the seized items before
seizure; and, fourth, because the seizure was so general, so
pervasive, so massive that it affected a restraint which re­
quired an adversary hearing on the question of obscenity in
advance of seizure.
We contend that the presence of the magistrate on

4
the premises not only failed to cure the constitutional
violations but. actually intensified them, and we urge that
the Fourth Amendment protects the petitioner against the
general search and mass seizure which took place here»
QUESTIONi

If you say that the presence of the

magistrate on the premises didn't even not only didn't cure
the problems to which you have alluded but actually intensi­
fied them, how would the state go about handling this sort of
a situation?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, the state went about handling

it —
QUESTION:

How would it, I said, in a constitutional

means?
MR. BSRXMAN:

It would seem to me that the entry

onto the premises, assuming no further rights any customer
might have to the purchase or the observation of material
which would not involve the authorization of an invalid
it to search and to
seizure that took plao

. and without the massive
here might be an acceptable way of

dealing with the situation.

Heller I think demonstrates the

manner in which this Court has held the seizure of material
after a careful focusing upon the entirety of the materials
involved was done and handled apparently properly at least.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that the proper pro­

cedure was for the officer, for an officer, not a judge but

5
an officer to go on the premises of the store and buy select­
ive pieces of materials, books and films, then take them back
and show them to the magistrate or the judge as the basis for
getting a warrant at a later point?
MR. BERKMAN:

As 1 read your decision in Heller,

Your Honor, it seems to me that that might have been appro­
priate, but there axe a number of other ways in which a
prosecution —
QUESTION:

Well, that is, you concede that is an

appropriate way, though, under Heller and other cases?
MR. BERKMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, and it seems to me

■•.here are a number of other ways in which a criminal prosecu­
tion might originate.

It might be that some citizen might

make a purchase which he regards to be inappropriate and seeks
law enforcement.

It seems to me that the state has myriads

of ways without violating both the First, Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments in 'which they might appropriately deal with the
question of obscenity.
QUESTION;

I had understood that the magistrate’s

premise, that the magistrate’s presence here was in order to
assure that before seizure some neutral and detached magis­
trate would have examined the material.

You say that simply

exacerbates the situation.
MR.. BERKMAN:

Your Honor, there are a couple of

things wrong with the position which has been taken by the

6
State of Mew York.

One is in our judgment the seizure was

accomplished before the magistrate did anything.

The seizure

was accomplished when eleven representatives of the law
enforcement agencies want upon the premises, some of them in
uniform, filtered throughout the store, manned themselves infront of the entrance, took the names and otherwise intimi~
dated persons who might have entered the store, kept the
place under virtual seige for approximately six hours,
ransacked the entire premises, took out all of the films that
were on the premises, took out all the projectors that were
on the premises, not only took out certain articles of
clothing which apparently hrd certain sexual connotations
but also took the mannequins upon which they were displayed,
.8#d under those circumstances it seems to me that the seizure
wac effect :.d. at the tine that they encircled and laid seige
to that little book store.

That is when it occurred.

It

occurred before the judge even got an opportunity to focus
searohingly.oh anything.
QUESTION:

Then the magistrate's presence neither

improves nor detracts from your case.
MR. BERKMAN:

I would only say, Your Honor, that

that may wall be true, but the problem is that when somebody
who appears to be a magistrate or a judge and someone to whom
an ordinary

.citizen might go for constitutional relief

actually appears on the scene as an executing officer and. for

7
a warrant which he himself has issued, you have problems of
perhaps an even more serious kind when he goes beyond the role
that the judge assumed in the Heller case by merely going on
to the scene and viewing the material and not exercising his
prerogative as an authority to make such a search,
QUESTION:

Would you have any problem whether it

was 11 or 22 or 33 officers entering the premises and buying
books, films and then either altogether or one by one leaving
the premises and taking them to a magistrate?
MR. BERKMAN :

Your Honor, I think the facts would

depend on each particular circumstance.

I think that a

massive number of law enforcement authorities may themselves
be an intimidating and controlling factor.

In this situation,

it was —
QUESTION:

What is the impact — let’s assume that

the proprietor is somewhat intimidated, what has that got to
do with what they buy and take to the magistrate?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, I think if they make a purchase

and if they act with no greater right than a customer might,
then that might ha appropriate.

But it seems to me that it

is possible under certain facts for a large number of people
that actually take over and effectuate a seizure of the
entire store by their presence and control and domination of
the place before they have an opportunity to take anything
back to a magistrate, and under those circumstances you might

8
have a seizure which is premature under the circumstances
that you suggest.
QUESTION:

In this connection, does not count two

relate in pare at least to the two films that one officer had
purchased?
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTIONs

Well, does that stand up?

MR. BERKMANs
the entire

Yes, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor.

It seems to me that

search has got to be looked at under circumstances

in which the entirety is considered,
QUESTION:

The search —

Those films were purchased before the

search ever took place.
MR. BERKMAN:

But, Your Honor, there were other

copies of the same film which were actually acquired during
the course of —
QUESTION ?,

I am speaking about the two that were

taken, that were purchased by the officer.
MR. BERKMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, and I am suggesting

that there vere additional copies of those very same 'films
seized in the raid of which we complain.
QUESTION:

Wall, suppose we invalidate that seizure,

aren't you still stuck with count two with respect to the two
purchased films?
MR. BERKMANs

I would urge not, Mr, Justice, be­

cause it seems to me that if you have a massive seizure then

9
there is no deterrent or propylactic effect at all if you
merely invalidate that part of it v/hich goes beyond the
appropriateness, because v/hat happens then is that police
officers are on notice that if they exceed the bounds of the
First and Fourth Amendment and in this instance with respect
to the states as applied through the Fourteenth, then all
that will happen in the event that it turns out that they
have lx3cn excessive in their zeal is that that portion of the
material which is exceeded will .be returned, but the original
invasion, the original violation of the constitutional pro­
visions will still have not been remedied.
QUESTION:

Hr. Eerkman, suppose after this case is

over the same two policemen go in and buy two films, could he
be prosecuted?
HR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Iam sorry, Your Honor?

Two policemen go in and buy two more

films.
HR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Two more films.

Could he be prosecuted?

MR. BERKMAN:

It would seem to me that if those

films are then focused searchingly on by a detached and
neutral magistrate, then perhaps that might be
QUESTION:

I said to give to any magistrate.

MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Then why isn’t the original seizure good?

10
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, it seems to me, Your Honor,

that there has bo be an arrangement in which there is a
focusing upon the material —
QUESTION:

I thought we had it here.

The two

policemen brought in two films —
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

— and said wa want action to the magis-

trate and he said that is gone.
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, the —

Or do I misquote you?

MR. BERKMAN:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

If that is

subjected to...a judicial scrutiny which passes constitutional
muster
QUESTION:

No, I am talking about on the record of

this case.
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Does that count stand?

MR. BERKMAN:

It seems to me that it cannot, Your

Honor, because it is —
QUESTION:

Because of what happened after that?

MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

It is all part and parcel of the —

If it is done afterwards, it is all

right?
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

It may ba, assuming that —

Well, I want to know the difference

11
between pro and after.
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, when you have a mass seizure

such as took place here, my under standing of the teaching of
the cases is —
QUESTION:

That cleans the whole slate?

MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Does that clean the whole prior slate?

MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

It seems to me that —

Yes, sir, I think it does.

Well, why didn't it clean the future

slate while it is at it?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, I think that each case has to

stand on its own, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Under my Brother Marshall's question,

had there just been a purchase of two items, there wouldn't
have needed to be a magistrate at all, there could have just
been a prosecution based upon those two items and it would
have been up to the jury and the instructions of the judge
and all.
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

That's quite right.

There wouldn't have been a search or

seizure, there would have just been the purchase cf two
items, wouldn’t there?
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

That's quite right, Your Honor.

I don't really — what was the purpose,

do you suppose, of this warrant which was signed on the

12
morning of June 25, 1976, even providing for the seizure of
items one and two, since those two items had already been
purchased, and were in the possession of the prosecuting
authorities?
MR. DERKMAM:

Your Honor, it is quite right, they

were evidence which was already available to the prosecuting
authorities —
QUESTION:

It was already in their possession,

wasn't it?
MR. HERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

It was already in the possession of the

prosecuting authorities?
MR. 3ERKMAN:

Of course, it was, and it seems to me

that the only purpose that there could have been for seizing
multiple copies of that film and for seizing other things in
the store was to actually close the operation and prevent
the exhibition and to block distribution of materials without
a prior adjudication.

In our judgment, it seems to us that

the record demonstrates —
QUESTION:

That is not this case, is it?

He was

c onvic ted , wa.sn 51 he ?
MR. BERKMAN:
that is this case.

Yes, Your Honor, he liras convicted, but

What happened here, Your Honor, was that

after having —
QUESTION:

I, for example, can see where you have

13
made a very good argument for action for damages , but I
couldn't see necessarily that that was a defense in the law­
suit.
MR. BERKMAN:
QUE3TI0N:

Well, Your Honor, it seems —

Now straighten me out.

MR. BERKMAN:

It seems to me, first of all, that in

this case there was a search and seizure which followed the
purchase of two films.
count.

Those two films dealt with only one

There were three counts upon which a conviction was

obtained, based upon the refusal of the court below to grant
the motion to suppress evidence because over 400 films appear
in count one which involve material, which was taken solely
as a result of what we contend was a defective warrant and a
massive search and seizure.

And with respect to the third

count, that involves the seizure of all the projectors and a
number of other items, none of which were in the possession
of the police officers prior to the search.
Now, it seems to me that with respect to the films
that were involved in count two, there were a multitude of
films which were involved apart from the two which had
originally been seized and, as a matter of fact, multiple
copies of those two had been seized as a result of the
search and seizure.

And so it is our contention that the

bulk of the basis for the prosecutions on all the counts
came as a result of what we contend was an illegal search and

seiaure.
QUESTION:

How did the conviction come about, what

did it rest on?
MR. BERKMAN:

The conviction occurred after the

motion to suppress was denied —
QUESTION:

And then what?

MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

-- and the parties pleaded guilty.

Yes.

MR. BERKMAN:

So —

Under New York procedure, it is

possible to seek appellate review of a denial of the motion
to suppress even after a plea of guilty.
QUESTION:

Now then, going back to the suggestion

or questions of several other of my colleagues, suppose we
agreed with you as to counts one and three and disagreed with
you as to count two, which if I have the numbers correct is
the one — count two rests on two films which standing alone
you don’t question,
MR. BERKMAN:

Your Honor, count two rests on those

two films plus hundreds of others.
QUESTION:

400.

QUESTION:

472.

MR. BERKMAN:

Yes.

And so consequently we are say­

ing that those are among them, but it may well be that those
that were taken were the ones upon which the conviction was
based.

So it seems to me that they are inseverable.

15
QUESTION:

Wait a minute.

If they have tried this

ease, there would be more of a problem, but if they are going
to jury verdict based on all of the films, the two plus all
the hundreds of others, here is a guilty plea with respect to
the two plus others under count two, is there not?
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, there is, Your Honor.

Then how do you justify challenging the

two that were properly in the possession of the police?
MR. BERKMAN:
which I do not know

Because the count itself, for reasons

and which were based upon determinations

of the law enforcement authorities of New York, they included
in one count not only the two films which were purchased but
also hundreds of others.

Now, it may well be that the guilty

plea —
QUESTION:

Where is the count you are talking about,

Is It 3(a)?
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, how do you know that the two that

were seized were included in count two?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, they were Identified in the

seizure of materials.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't a guilty plea waive any

defect in the information of indictment?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, we are not claiming that there

is a defect in the information or indictment.

We are

claiming that the materials unon which the information and
Indictment are bottomed were themselves obtained by illegal
search and seizure, and under New York procedure even after
a guilty plea you are permitted to seek appellate review and
I am referring ■—
QUESTION:

But you concede that two items were not,

1 take it?
MR. BERKMAN:

Two of the hundreds of items in count

two had been acquired by a purchase of the police officers
and had been viewed in advance by the magistrate prior to the
seizure involved here, yes.
QUESTION:

And he pleaded guilty with respect to

those two, along with others?
MR. BERKMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, with the understand­

ing — and it was done after the motion to suppress had been
denied and under the provisions of section 710.70, subsection
2 of the New York Criminal Procedure Code.
QUESTION:

In addition to the two Individual items

that had been purchased, I suppose under the purported ,
authority of the search warrant several duplicate copies were
seized under parap;raphs one and two of the search warrant,
weren't they?
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

The same items?

MR. BERKMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

17
QUESTION:

The search warrant does, by using the

plural "reels51 in both cases, authorize the seizure of
duplicate copies, doesn’t it?
MR. BERMAN:

Right.

In fact, everything that was

on the premises by way of a duplicate of those two films were
seized in the course of the —
QUESTION:

Where do you find that the two copies

that were purchased are included in count two?
MR. BERMAN:

Well, the films appeared in count two

and the books appeared in the first count.
QUESTION:

I know, but tell me how you know that

among the 474 movie reels mentioned in count two, how do you
know that the two that were bought were —
MR. BERMAN:

I cannot tell that, :four Honor, and

that —
QUESTION:

Suppose they weren’t?,

MR. BERMAN:
QUESTION-:

Then you have no problem at all?

MR. BERMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, then

None at all.

Well, how do you know they are even In

there?
MR. BERMAN:
QUESTION:

I don’t know that.

I thought you could do that by a process

of going over the inventory.
MR. BERKMAN:

Only by going over the inventory, but

18
It is true, Your Honor, that Insofar as —
QUESTION:

Well, how would you know which is which?

MR. BERKMAN:

You can't tell that.

And it seems to

me that because of the ambiguity there that —
QUESTION:

If the officer bought them and they were

his, it is a strange way then to say to charge somebody with
possessing.

Maybe he did possess them at one time.

MR. BERKMAN:

.Yes, Your Honor, but if he did possess

them, he possessed other copies of the same films which were
seised during the course of the raid of which we complain.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

And we have said before that that

one

appropriate way to go about it, to seise a sample of the par­
ticular item, one sample.

Now, a3 to two films, it is clear

that that was done, is it not?
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

It is not?

MR. BERKMAN:

I don’t think that is clear, because

what happened as a result of this was that the entire inven­
tory of the store was ransacked on the basis of what we can’t
contend to have been an excuse employed in order to make it
appear as though there was a search under a warrant.

Once

you have two films, it seems to me that the necessity of
acquiring two more from a law enforcement standpoint is nil.
The only reason for acquiring two more —

19
QUESTION:

Unless you want to charge him with the

crime of possession, because if you have them he no longer
possesses them.
MR. BERKMAN:

Yes.

On the other hand, it seems to

me that there are abundant opportunities to charge a store
owner under these circumstances with either these films or
others on the basis of the condition of the store and its
inventory.
QUESTION:

Well, there is nothing wrong with him

going back and buying eight or ten more books.
MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

And I suppose if the search warrant pro­

cedures were validated, there would be nothing wrong with
— properly carried out, there would be nothing wrong with
seizing them under a search warrant if those procedures were
proper.
MR. BERKMAN:

I think that is right.

As a matter

of fact, in view of the fact that only three counts were
brought, there would be no limitation upon the law enforcement
power of the State of New York in terms of what it was that
it was doing under these circumstances in controlling the
distribution of what it claimed to be obscenity.
i

Now, we urge further that the Fourth Amendment pro­
tects the petitioner against the general search and mass
seizure which took place here.

That just because the

20
petitioner opened its store to invite customers into his
premises to buy merchandise does not mean, as the State of
New York now contends, that its entire expectation of privacy
is forfeited to the occupation of its premises by a police
force.
QUESTION:

Suppose this had been done by one

officer, without the ten —MR. BERKMAN:
what he did.

It seems to me that it depends upon

If he came —

QUESTION:

Well, suppose one officer did everything

tha.t the eleven officers did.
MR. BERKMAN:

It would seem to me then that it would

still not be sufficient, Your Honor, for the reason —
QUESTION:

The eleven or one is not really crucial

to the case?
MR. BERKMAN:

No.

I think that the massive number

only has to do with a part of the facts involving the per­
vasive seizure and control and domination of the entire
enterprise.

The fact is that these police officers did not

limit themselves to the position of a customer on the premises.
Indeed, if a customer on the premises had come in and ran­
sacked the material and taken the books off the display
shelves and put them on the floor and torn off the cellophane
covers and stood in front and stopped customers from coming
in and taken their names and addresses and rummaged through

21
business records and had done all of the things that these
police officers did, this store proprietor in my judgment
would have had the right to call these very policemen and
eject them and to bring actions against them for trespassing.
And so consequently they do not stand in the shoes of a
normal customer and for that reason it seems to me that the
store proprietor does not lose his expectation of privacy
with respect to the fact that there will not be a police
force which will do the things which have been done here.
Now, it seems to me. Your Honor, that we must first
take a look at the warrant.

The warrant itself demonstrates

nothing by way of probable cause with respect to any other
item than the two films themselves which were purchased and
reviewed by both the judge and the police officer.

There is

a list of things to come, predictions of things to come in
section three of the warrant which says that there are a
bunch of other items that are to be seized as well, but they
were absolutely blind at the time of the search and seizure.
QUESTION:

Do you think that if a magistrate ac­

companies an investigator to a store and he examines books
on the shelves and looks at them as much as he wants and
then goes back to the office and issues a search warrant to
seize one copy of each of the following titles as evidence,
and he says I have searchlngly focused on the issue of
obscenity and think there is probable cause to believe they

22
are obscene?
MR. BERKMAN:

So long as he does not use his

judicial authority to effectuate a search during, the time
ths.t he is examining the material.

If he acts in the way

that the judge in Heller v. New York did, then we would have
no objection to that.
What occurred here, however, is that they took posession of the store and seized its entire contents before
any of that judicial review occurred.

And there is another

problem, too, and that is that when a magistrate Issues a
warrant after himself has- participated in a search and
seizure, he becomes a part of —
QUESTION:

If he comes to the store and if he does

nothing in the store that any other member of the public
could not do, if he does nothing but what a member of the
public could do, that is all he did, that would be different.
MR. BERKMAN:

And if he has not used the force of

his judicial office and he has not effectuated a search.
QUESTION:

Well, he didn't have to put in a quarter

to view the movie reels, did he?
MR. BERKMAN:

As a matter of fact, that is what the

record does reflect, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

On the other

hand, however, at the time that the police officers arrived in
force, they came and announced that this individual was under
arrest.

They read him his Miranda rights, they also announced

23

that they were going to search the premises and they produced
what purported to be a warrant and under those circumstances
it seems to me that he was acquiescing to authority and not
consenting to anything that would have any constitutional
import.

He was not a free agent under any circumstances

during the six-hour period when he was on the premises.

The

officer quite candidly admitted that he was not free to leave,
he was under arrest and he was in a situation where a number
of officers were all over the store and it would seem to me
that the interest of safety and concern might have caused him
to make such a comment without in any way having it to be
voluntary consent.
QUESTION:

But that wouldn't be — that wouldn't

reach taking the cellophane or the plastic wrappers off the
books?
MR. BERKMAN:
of any kind to that.

There was never any purported consent
They just came in and took the merchan­

dise off the shelves, piled it on the floor, tore off the
covers because there is a cellophane seal on them which pre­
vents anyone from opening the package and looking Inside, and
consequently there was no suggestion that anyone offered an
invitation to the officers to open those seals, nor to look
at business records nor to do the myriad other things that
occurred during the course of this record.
QUESTION:

Mr. Berkman, for the constitutional

2'A

purposes of this case and laying aside for the moment the
special consideration given to books which we have indicated
in our opinions, is this case any different from what it
would be if a warrant had been issued to pick up. two sample
cans of spinach on the ground they had information or had
reason to believe that they might be contaminated and the two
cans of spinach were seized and then all the things that
happened here with reference to the other merchandise occurred,
all of the canned goods in a grocery store, all the bread and
everything else was taken, is it fundamentally any different?
MR. BERMAN:

Well, it would seem to me that it is

fundamentally different because of the First Amendment impli­
cations .
QUESTION:

Well, except for that, laying that aside.

MR. BERKMAN:

Also it is unclear when a criminal

prosecution occurs as to whether or not the cans of spinach
are even involved.
stantial difference.

I would think that that would be a sub­
I think that if there is probable cause

to seize the spinach in the numbers that you suggest, that
that in itself suggests no Fourth Amendment problems, and
so 'long as the materials are particularly described I d or ’ t
see that that raises any question.
QUESTION:

Well, the Food and Drug Administration

does make seizures at times, do they not?
MR. BERMAN:

I understand that.

25
QUESTION:

But I take it from your point of view

that they can’t seize all the spinach in the store until they
determine on the

basis of sampling that some of it is con­

taminated .
MR. BERKMAN:

Except for the considerations of prob­

able cause in particularity, Your Honor, which are requirements
with respect to all Fourth Amendment seizures.

It would seem

to me that you have special prior restraint problems when you
have First Amendment material xvhich doesn't apply to spinach.

QUESTION:

But so far as the Fourth Amendment is

concerned, there is no difference, is there?
MR. BERKMAN:

So long as particularity and specific­

ity and probable cause requirements are met, it would seem to
me.

And then, of course, I think it would depend upon

whether or not a warrant were required in all of those con­
siderations.
QUESTION:

Isn’t one of the reasons — isn’t the

principle reason they had cellophane wrappers over the books
to prevent free-loaders from reading them without buying them?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, there is nothing in tne record

on that subject, but I would suppose that that might be a
factor.
QUESTION:

Well, are you saying then that a police

officer has to buy the book before he can inspect it?
MR. BERKMAN:

I think that either he has to acquire

26
It in some lawful way on it may well be that a customer or
somebody else has acquired certain materials -QUESTION:

But you say a police officer cannot in­

spect a book on the premises by tearing the cellophane cover
off?
MR. BERKMAN:

It seems to me that he is limited to

performing in the way that a customer would be permitted to
perform.

If he exceeds that, then he is acting as a policeman

and not as a customer and exceeds any such responsibility,
and I think that becomes a seizure.
Now, I think the fact -QUESTION:

The mere tearing off the wrapper becomes

a seizure?
MR. BERKMAN:

Yes, I think as this Court has in­

dicated in Terry and recently in Delaware v. Prouse, very
little is required in order to effectuate a seizure either of
a person or —
QUESTION:

In effect, it would be like breaking the

can of spinach open with a can opener?
MR. BERKMAN:

A can of spinach, indeed, Your Honor,

or opening the trunk of Mr. Chadwick in the Chadwick case.
You know, any of those items it seems to me effectuates a
seizure.
QUESTION:

There is a real difference between a

customer and a policeman in that a customer has money.

27
MR. BERMAN:
QUESTION:

Isn't that the real difference?

MR. BERKMAN:
QUESTION:

Well —

Well, apparently —

A customer buys something and pays for

It.
MR. BERKMAN:

That’s right. Your Honor.

That’s

right. Your Honor, but he acquires it in a lawful manner and
that, of course, is a touchstone which I think has constitu­
tional implications.
QUESTION:
money.

Whether it is lax-jful or not, but it is

The policemen didn’t put out a nickel while they were

in that place, did they?
MR. BERMAN:

Except for the two books that they

originally purchased.
QUESTION:

No, I mean when the others went in with

the magistrate.
MR. BERMAN:

That’s right.

That’s right, they did

not.
QUESTION:

Nobody spent a nickel.

Isn’t that the

real difference?
MR. BERKMAN:

Well, I think the difference is be­

cause of legal acquisition and acquisition by something other
than the authority of the state which makes the constitutional
difference.
The attempt by the state to deal with the warrant

28
by after the fact, adding It pages to a two-page warrant,
demonstrates the importance of their concern that the warrant
be the basis upon which they attempted to search.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Berkman.

Mr. Parker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. PARKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PARKER:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

My name is Richard Parker, and I am an Assistant

District Attorney from Goshen, New York, a small upstate
county.
The legislature of the State of New York has de­
clared in uncertain terms how are public policy to be the
protection of moral decency and in furtherance of this public
policy it has authorized the various units of the state to
prosecute criminal possession of promoting obscene material.
In order to effectuate this police policy against a commer­
cial establishment which has a large number of obscene items
and obscene material, we have tried after study i.ng this
Court's decisions to come up with a procedure which on one
hand will protect First Amendment rights and on the other
hand gives us an opportunity to effectuate this legislative
policy.
In effect, what we have tried to do Is find a fair

29
middle ground.

What we did in this case was have a police

officer go to the store and look around the store.
bought a small sample of txvo items.

He then

And to clarify for the

record, Mr. Mandakis, the clerk of the store, was charged for
possessing with intent of promoting these two items on the
day that these items were sold.
QUESTION:

Where do you see that?

MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

The officer ~~

No.
Where do you see that charge in the

appendix?
MR. PARKER:
brief.

No, that is a footnote I believe in my

Mr. Mandakis* case is not on appeal.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

I see.
He subsequently pleaded guilty to

disorderly conduct, was given a conditional discharge.
QUESTION:

For possessing those two items on the

day they were purchased.
MR. PARKER:

Well, promoting those two items on the

day they were purchased.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Pr omoting.
Yes.
They aren’t included in this 400-and-

some films?
MR. PARKER:
two are not

The same films are included but those

30
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

How do you know they are?
Prom the inventory.

The inventory in

the search warrant tells you, the inventory lists all *172
items, the reels of the film, lists all the magazines and
lists the names of all the films that were —
QUESTION:

Well, you certainly wouldn’t list these

two items that had been bought on a search warrant or on an
Inventory of things that had been seized in a search warrant
because they weren’t seized in a search warrant.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

No, but other copies that were —
I know, but I am talking about these two

copies.
MR. PARKER:

Right, it wasn't these two copies,

that’s right.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

So those are out.
Yes, that is —
That is all I wanted to know.
Yes.

I want to clarify that.

So the only ones on which this convic­

tion rests are the ones that were seized in the search and
seizure under the xrarrant?
MR. PARKER:

Yes, and If you look at the criminal

charges, the basis of these charges are for promoting the
items on June 20th, the date of this seizure.
QUESTION:

Let's assume that when these two films

31
were bought, they were brought back to the judge, suppose the
judge had looked at them and said I have now focused on the
nature of these articles, I have read them from cover to
cover, there is probable cause to think that they are obscene,
I hereby authorize you to go back to the store and seize all
other copies of these two books.

Tell me what case in this

Court would warrant that,
MR. PARKER:

I don't believe any case in this Court

would warrant that alone.
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, there are cases

that would say that would be forbidden?
MR. PARKER:

Yes, but I think there is an important

distinction in this case, and that was that when we went into
this book store and before there was any seizure, we entered
the store, it was open to the public, and when we went in
there the clerk was given a warrant and was told that he had
the right to an immediate adversary hearing as soon as he
would be ready or the owner of those materials —
QUESTION:

I know, but before the hearing, whenever

the hearing was, even if it was tomorrow or this afternoon,
you took all copies out of circulation.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Temporarily we did, yes.
Well, tell me some case that warrants

that.
MR, PARKER:

I believe under Kingsley Books we can

32
do that.

In Kingsley Books, it was a case where more than one

copy of the book was taken.
QUESTION:

I thought there had to be an adversary

hearing before you completely remove from circulation all
copies of materials like this.
MR. PARKER:

I don't believe — I believe Kingsley

Books, the Court held that you could temporarily take those
items and then hold an adversary hearing after the —
QUESTION:

Kingsley Books was an interim injunction,

it wasn't a seizure.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Well, it was —
What we are talking about is Marcus and

Quantity Books.
MR. PARKER:

I believe this is different from Maruc

and Quantity Books.
QUESTION:

Different from what my Brother White has

just been suggesting?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Yes.
How is it different?
It is different because before the

items were taken as evidence, a judge had viewed the items and
made a probable cause determination, plus it is different
because after they were taken —
QUESTION:

But Marcus and Quantity Books said you

can’t seize the whole group without having the adversary

33
proceeding first.
MR. PARKER:

Well, they said you cannot seize them

for destruction purposes.

We were seizing them for evidence

purposes to bring a criminal prosecution and we were going to
bring that as soon as we possibly could.

And I should add

that at no time did the petitioner in this case ever ask for
any hearing as to the obscenity.

As a matter of fact, he

pleaded guilty as to the obscenity of all of the items.
QUESTION:

After you denied his motion to suppress.

He took advantage of your New York statute which permitted him
to do that.
MR. PARKER:

That's right, but under our New York

statute he could have had a trial on the issue of obscenity
and —
QUESTION:

I know, but your New York statute per­

mitted him to do just exactly what he did.
MR. PARKER:

That's right, but it certainly didn't

in any way inhibit him from also having a trial as if he
thought the items were not obscene.

He could have had that

trial also.
The reason I feel that this procedure is fair and
proper is because we have the safeguards of having a prior
judicial officer look at the material before it is seized,
the officer had -- the judicial officer first had —
QUESTION:

The judicial officer spent six hours in

34
there.

Was he a judicial officer or was he a biased person?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

I think that —
After being In there and looking at the

material for six hours, wouldn't he be influenced one way or
the other?
MR. PARKER:

I believe the material may influence

him •—•
QUESTION:

Wouldn't he be influenced one way or the

other?
MR, PARKER:

I believe that material may influence

him but I don't think it changes his being biased.

I think

the record shows that at all times he did what he thought
should be done.

He was leading the party.

In other words,

he made the determinations of what should be taken and what
should not" be taken.

He made the determination of whether or

not an item should be taken even towards the end, I think it
is clear from the record.
QUESTION:

And if you had a hearing, who would pre­

side over the hearing?
MR. PARKER:

Well, at the hearing there would have

been a different judicial officer presiding.
QUESTION:

Well, he authorized it after the fact,

that’s the problem.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Well, I don’t believe —
They would break the cellophane and bring

35
the book to him and he would say, okay, add to that, yes,
that's okay, seize that, but they had already seized it.
MR, PARKER:
seized anything.

I disagree that they had already

As a matter of fact, I feel that the judge

had gone through this entire store and determined that every­
thing ■—
QUESTION:

Wasn't the testimony that he wasn't free

to leave, that he was under arrest?
MR. PARKER:

The testimony was that he was told that

there was a warrant for his arrest, he was free to move
freely throughout the store, he was bought a meal, he moved
freely around the
QUESTION:

What do you mean when you say he moved

freely throughout the store?

Doesn’t it mean he is not free

to move outside?
MR. PARKER:

Yes, he would not have been free to

move outside and our —

It was a seizure when they walked in

MR. PARKER:

There was a seizure of his person but

not a seizure of the materials.

MR. PARKER:

MR. PARKER:

Well, what do you need eleven for?
Well, the reason —
Was he a rough man or something?
No, I think the reason that you had all

of these people here was to try to do the search —QUESTION:

These weren’t people, these were police.

They are different from people.
MR, PARKER:

Nell, I have always considered a

policeman a person, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

They are different from the average

I wonder if they had a gun.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, they did.
That is different from —• do you have a

gun?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
Well, that is different, isn’t it?
Yes.
Well, when you say there are eleven

police in there and you say it is not seizure, I want to- know
what is it, a visit?
MR. PARKER:

A friendly visit?
I think the reason you had the number

of these people is so you can expedite the procedure as
quickly as possible.

We have people there — you have one

person who was there who was recording what the judge was
doing, you had other people there who were gathering the
items that the judge had told them to seize, you had other
people there who would put things in order so the judge could
review them as quickly as possible, you had other people who
were at the front of the store to find out

37
QUESTION:

Well, the things that they put together

for the judge, were they seized?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

No, they weren't, I don't believe.
What were they, detained?
Well, they were in the store, they xtfere

Could the owner take them away from them?

him.

If he was big enough.
What?
If he was big enough.
I don't think they xrould have fought

There was no indication of that, but -QUESTION:

You see, my problem is that a warrant

by definition is a prior authorization.

It is a prior

authorization issued upon probable cause, particularly
describing the place to be searched and the thing or things
to be seized, and there was not a prior authorization here.
Here it says the judge in the store there first ordered the
police to rip off the sealed plastic which completely enclosed
each of the magazines and many of the books in the store.
Then he looked through them.

But that is not a prior authori­

There was a seizure before the authority to do it.
MR. PARKER:

Well, 1 think if you look at —

QUESTION:
by definition

That is the problem, because a warrant

is a prior authorization,

MR. PARKER:

The State of New York has upheld this,

which is in effect an oral warrant, and they have upheld
under these circumstances when we are dealing with books and
\films and magazines where you have to have a judge go in and
look at it prior.

They have said —-

And that is the reason this case is here,

because the New York courts upheld it.
MR. PARKER:

Yes, but they —

have to pay the man the price of the gun, do you?
MR. PARKER:

No, you don't. Your Honor.

But the

point 1 would like to make there is that what we have — the
function of the warrant, the purpose of a warrant, as you have
stated, Mr. Justice -QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Is prior authorization.
— is, one, to have prior authoriza­

tion of probable cause, and, two, to limit the police dis­
cretion by particularly describing what they should take.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Right.
This judge looked at the material and —
After it had been seized.
Well, I submit it wasn't after it had

39
been seized because I

in other words, I submit that there

was no seizure of material that was left in the store.

There

were many items that he looked at and determined were not
obscene and he left them in the store.
QUESTION:

But how about taking the cellophane off

of a book, isn’t that a search?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

In a way it is a search, but —
In a way?

You certainly can’t just pet­

it down like you can if — and tell if it is obscene.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Well, you see, these magazines —
Sometimes you can pat people down and

see if there are -- but you can’t search them.

Here they took

the cellophane off the packages and actually looked at the
books.
MR. PARKER:

But they were taking the cellophane off

the books which had obscene photographs on the front of the
book which is almost identical to seeing a bulge outside
someone and patting him down.

I believe that the judge, given

the nature of this market, would have had the right, after
seeing an obscene photograph, ask the police —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1:00 o’clock.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o’clock noon, the Court was
recessed until 1:00 o’clock p.m.)

40
AFTERNOON SESSION - 1:00 O'CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. PARKER:

Counsel, you may resume.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I respectfully submit to the Court that the seizure
of more than one copy does not invalidate the entire search.
It must be remembered that under New York lax?, a person is
prosecuted not for merely possessing the item but for pro­
moting the item.

Now, obviously this is a commercial —

QUESTION:

That is an understatement for seizing

more than one, isn’t it?
MR. PARKER:

You seized them all.

No, we did not seize everything.

We

left many magazines and all of the books.
QUESTION:

I know, but did you seize all the copies

of any magazine?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Yes.

Yes, any time —

So it was an understatement.
Any time the judge, after viewing the

item, felt that there was probable cause for seizing all of
the —
QUESTION:
MR, PARKER:

You seized all of the items?
— he seized every copy In that store.

But there was never any claim made that this person did not
have access to other items or could not bring them in the
next day.

QUESTION:

But he couldn't sell those particular

items.
MR. PARKER:

He could not sell those items, that is

correct.
QUESTiON:

Wouldn't that have some resemblance to

prior restraint?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Obviously -If you took all of the books of a par­

ticular category, they couldn't sell them.
MR. PARKER:

He could not sell them.

That doesn’t

mean they were not available to the-public In the area.

There

were other stores -QUESTION:

I am talking about restraint on him.

MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, there was, but that was —
He has been restrained from selling those

books.
MR. PARKER:

Right, but that restraint I submit was

a temporary restraint and he had the right to a full hearing
and also that restraint was for a valid ev id (inti ary purpose,
to show that he was promoting the item.

Under our law, there

is a presumption that if you possess six or more of the same
items, it is presumptive evidence that you possess with the
intent to promote.

And what we had to show, aside from the

fact that the items were themselves obscene, that this person
was promoting obscenity on the day in question, so there was

a valid evidentiary reason to seize them and —
QUESTION:
show that.

But you didn’t have to seize them all to

There could actually just have been testimony.
MR. PARKER:

Obviously there could be testimony, but

the best evidence would be showing the jury the fact that you
have these many items.
QUESTION:

If you wanted to be a little more sure,

maybe you would take one plus six.
MR. PARKER:

Well, as you can see from our brief,

very few, I think only on one or two occasions did they seize
more than six.

Most of the items, the vast majority, only

one item was seized and then there are some where they took
two of the items.

Mostly one or two items were seized.

In

very few were there more than six being seized or more than
five being seized.
Now, the other method -- another point should be
made that you have three separate pleas of guilty and under
the third count for the films and the peep shows, there were
no duplicate seizures there.
separate.

That count was entirely

That was the first part of the search, and there

were no duplicates.

The only thing that was seized was one

copy of the film that was being displayed to the public.
QUESTION:

Could that be that there weren’t any

duplicates?
MR. PARKER:

What?

QUESTION:

Could it be that there weren’t any dupli­

cates?
MR. PARKER:

There weren't duplicates.

There was

one copy that was there and that was seized.
QUESTION:

That’s right.

MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So If there were more there, they would

have seized them, wouldn’t they?
MR. PARKER:

Probably.
And the projectors were seized, weren't

QUESTION:
they?
MR. PARKER:
to show promotion.

Yes, the projectors were seized again

Now, the other method that has been sug­

gested is to go In and to buy the item, but unfortunately in
a small upstate county like we have, we don't have the funds
to go in and buy. all the obscene items that are being com­
mercially displayed and exploited to the public because the
affidavit of petitioner, in support of his allegations for a
search warrant, he said that we took $15,000 worth of
material.

That is what he said his costs were.

I have

never totalled it up, but assuming his figure is correct,
our entire investigatory budget for the whole county to fight
all crime in our county is only $20,000.

We wouldn’t have

enough funds, public funds to go and expend to buy all of
the obscene material that is being promoted.

So the only —

I mean, we cannot go In there and buy one or two copies, buy
one copy of each item there, there is just not enough money
in our budget to do it.

This is really the only effective

way we have to enforce our legislative policy.
QUESTION:

What was the — there was a plea of

guilty?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Yes.
There never was a sentence?
Yes, the sentence was a fine of $1,000

on each count.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
$1,000.

On each separate count?
Yes, each separate count had a fine of

That fine has been paid.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

How many counts were there?
Three, three separate counts.
So now you have $23,000.
No, we don't get that fine money, that

goes to the state.
I submit that the procedure we employed here is a
limited procedure which protects First Amendment rights.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Protects them?
Yes, and I — first of all, the entry

into the store under this procedure is limited to stores when
they are open to the public, the items that are being viewed
are limited to the judge viewing items that are being openly

45
displayed to the public, you have a judge or a judicial of­
ficer who is viewing the items before anything is taken from
the store —
QUESTION:

After he rips it open.

MR. PARKER:

Yes, after it has been ripped open.

But you have a cover on this which gives them, I submit,
probable cause to make further inquiry to see if the item is
obscene, especially after a police officer has gone in, has
found out that this —
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Eleven police officers.
No, initially one police officer goes

in, he bought a small sample —
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

He needed the support of ten others.
To make the search.
Yes.
He needed that support in order to

make it as quick as possible so that there would be the least
amount of restraint as possible.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
takes time.

Restraint?
Well, restraint in the sense that It

If you have one judge, if the judge goes in by

himself, it is going to take him much longer to go over
everything, to look at everything and to gather it up and
take it out of the store.

So then the petitioner would claim

that it was a longer restraint.

46
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

It took them six hours, didn’t it?
It did take them six hours because he

had to —
QUESTION:

I guess if it was only one, it would be

a couple of days, wouldn't it?
MR. PARKER:

I believe it would take much longer.

I can’t tell you how long it would take.
QUESTION:

I gather no member of the public would

have the privilege of going in and looking at all these movies
and these machines?
MR. PARKER:

Certainly they would have the privilege

of going in and looking at the movies in the machines.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

But for a quarter.
Yes, and the judge in this case, and

the record clearly indicates that the judge offered to put a
quarter in every machine and the clerk of the store said it
won’t be necessary, I can turn them on so it will be quicker
and he voluntarily turned them on.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

And you say that wasn't a search?
I am saying that the viewing —
That wasn't a search because any member

of the public could have done it with a quarter?
MR. PARKER:

What I am saying is that the viewing

of the material which is openly displayed to the public,
there is no reasonable expectation of this petitioner that

47
the public will not see this material.

I am saying that that

viewing is not —
QUESTION:

Well, there is in the cellophane packages

unless the public buys it and pays the money.
MR. PARKER:

Yes, but in other words these items are

not being hidden from the public.

When you think of the word

"search,’1 you think of looking for something that is being
hidden.

This is not material that is being hidden.

This is

material that is being displayed openly to the public in areas
of the store open to the public.

At no time did any member

of the law enforcement or this judge ever go into a store
room or to see what was not being displayed to the public.

It

was limited to the public areas, that items that were openly
displayed to the public.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

What happened to the business records?
The business records were seized to

show -QUESTION:

They were not in the public area, were

they?
MR. PARKER:

They were behind the front desk, I

believe.
QUESTION:

You say everything was out In the public

area.
MR. PARKER:

Everything that he was charged with

possessing under this statute, under this information was

48
limited to public areas.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

But they did go into the private areas?
They went behind the counter, yes.
By what right did they go behind the

counter?
MR. PARKER:

Because that is where the clerk of the

store had stationed himself.
QUESTION:

If I understand, up to now you said the

only thing they did, the only place they went was where the
public went.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Now you admit that they did go to some

places that the public didn’t go.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

The clerk was there --Is that right?
The clerk -Is that right?
They went behind to arrest the clerk.
And the public didn’t go behind the

counter.
MR. PARKER:
behind there.

No, I don’t believe the public would go

They did go behind there to arrest him, the

clerk.
Now, I would say at the time of entry, based upon
the fact that the officer had learned from the clerk that the

/49

store was selling this sex type material on June 20th when he
bought two items, and the judge had in fact reviewed two of
those items in their entirety, that the judge certainly had
probable cause to believe there were going to be other items
in the store of a commercial, being exploited on a commercial
nature which were sexually obscene material, and 1 think this
may give him another basis.

I am not claiming this was the

basis he used but I am claiming that he certainly had reason
to look at other items in the store and had a reason to be­
lieve that in this type of market, which is exclusively
selling sexually explicit material, that he certainly had a
right to look at whatever was being displayed to the public,
to make an initial screening so that he could determine for
himself whether or not there was probable cause for the
seizure.
QUESTION:

Now let me get it clear.

Do you say

that all of the movies, movie reels in count two are differ­
ent ?
MR. PARKER:

Not all are different.

There are

some duplicates.
QUESTION:

Well, any one that he looked at that he

thought was obscene, he seized all copies of that film?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Yes.
Okay.
Yes, he did.

But the issue of the way

he focused on the material which had been raised by counsel
has to be —- it must be emphasized that this focusing, the
market where this was done, that the judge had first seen
two short films in their entirety, had then gone into the
booths and seen parts, and I say a substantial part of many
of each of these films and continuously would see films which
were just depicting one sex act after another.

I submit that

in this type of market, a judge could do enough Initial
search without having to see the entire item to know that
there is probable cause to believe it is obscene and to bring
it into court so there can be a criminal prosecution
QUESTION:

Are there any cases -— I think there is

a case or two that involve projectors, seizing projectors.
Do you know of any case that involves the seizure of all
projectors so that the person in the business of showing
movies has to order a new projector in order to show anything
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I am not aware of any,
I think you left him some films, didn’t

you?
MR. PARKER:

I don’t believe he was left any films.

1 believe all the films were taken out of the store.

There

were books and magazines left in the store.
QUESTION:

But if he wanted to show some films that

weren't obscene, he still wouldn't have any projectors, would

51
he?
MR. PARKER:

He would not have, no.

But I think

throughout the procedure that we were not trying to suppress
the material or try to close this store down.

What we tried

to do from the beginning was find ■—
QUESTION:

You closed down the moving picture part

of the store, for sure.
MR. PARKER:

We did it temporarily, but the point

was from the beginning we tried to do this in such a way that
we could effectively carry out the legislative mandate to
protect moral decency, but we did it in such a way that this
individual was first of all given written notification of his
right to an Immediate hearing before any seizure at all.
That was in the warrant.
QUESTION:

Well, what did you have after you

seized 400 films that you wouldn't have had if you had only
seized ten?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Well, what you would have —
Say you had seized ten and one projector

and then you went to trial on that, what would you have had
then?
MR. PARKER:

You would not have a judicial

ruling

on whether or not the other RbO or the other 280 different
films, whether or not those were obscene.
different film.

Each film was a

52
QUESTION:

You run the risk that those particular

ten would be found to be not obscene, I suppose.
MR. PARKER:

If they are found not obscene then he

can display them openly and promote them to the public, if
there is a ruling that they are not obscene.
we don’t mind that.

We have no --

What we are trying to do in effect is

find an effective way to protect moral decency, given the
fact that we have a large commercial store which is selling a
vast number of obscene items, we want to briny all these
items into court as quickly as we can, as efficiently as we
can, so we can yet a full prompt judicial review as to each
of these items to determine that they are in fact obscene,
and before we do that we ask a judge to give us an initial
determination that they were in fact obscene or there was
probable cause to believe they were obscene and then we gave
them the right to litigate.
QUESTION:

On this basis you didn't need more than

one copy of each book?
MR. PARKER:

You did need it because they were

being brought in for criminal purposes and the criminal law
Is not mere possesison, it is promoting, and we have to also
show promotion unless there is going to be a stipulation as
to promoting.
QUESTION:

Well, if you have evidence as to how

many there were, you don’t always disbelieve x^itnesses there

53
in Goshen, do you?
MR. PARKER:

No, they don't, but the best evidence

is always having the actual material there.

And I would

submit that since they had the right to have a hearing im­
mediately as soon as they were ready, that a temporary
restraint of this sort would not invalidate the entire search.
Perhaps the court would order that the other materials should
have been returned, but if the violation of the law in. this
case is that they took too many copies under the First
Amendment, then I think the appropriate remedy would not be
exclusion under the Fourth Amendment of the entire search
but would be to order — the court order the police to return
the extra copies and then let the conviction stand.
Nov/, I think that in looking at the entire procedure
that v/e follox/ed in order to try to find a fair middle
ground to bring all these items into court, that this is the
only procedure, fair procedure that you can use, there is no
other procedure that would effectively work to brl.v: the vast
number of items into court.

You can’t subpoena the items

because if you try a subpoena you come to the exact same
situation, that if you wait for the issue to be joint, you
run the risk that the items are going to disappear, they
will claim that they have been sold in due course, or in
this case where you deal with a corporation, it is an out-ofstate corporation that rents a store, that if we subpoena,

54
make the subpoena duces tecum against that corporation, as in
fact happened in this case, he changes corporate identity and
there is further delay so we lose the —
QUESTION:

Suppose you seized a cony of a book of

which there were a hundred conies in the store, and you had a
trial two days later, an adversary trial and it was deter­
mined to be obscene, you can go back and get all the rest of
them,
MR, PARKER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
And what would be the — if they were

still there,
MR. PARKER:

That is the problem, if they are still

t her e.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the harm if they are not

still there?
MR. PARKER:

Well, the harm if they are not still

there is that what we have done is we have allowed the —
QUESTION:

Suppose they convicted him in this two-

day trial.
MR. PARKER:

Okay.

You are allowing him in the

interim to continue to sell the material which was —
QUESTION:

He doesn’t have any more, in my

hypothesis they have gone out of state, now how is your state
hurt by that?
MR. PARKER:

No, they haven’t gone, they don't have

55
to go out of state.

The corporation, all they have to do is

change the corporate name, they rent a building, an out-ofstate corporation comes in and says we are running it.
QUESTION:

By changing the name, have they moved

the books?
MR. PARKER:

Well, now you have a new corporation

that you have to go after, you have to start all over again,
which means that there is going to be judicial delay which
means that material can be sold in the Interim.
QUESTION:

And you have been inconvenienced.

MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

I think that —
And you have been inconvenienced.

MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think —
In the prosecution.

MR. PARKER:

It would be much more difficult cer­

tainly.
QUESTION:

You would be Inconvenienced.

MR. PARKER:
in that.

Certainly because of what is involved

But I think —
QUESTION:

Do you ever consider civil remedies

against these people, to get an injunction against operating?
MR. PARKER:
completely analogous.

Getting an injunction would not be
in order to insure that the evidence

was there, you would have to get a temporary restraining
order.

To get the temporary restraining order to keep them

56
there, you would have to I would submit bring the judge to
the store to at least make that Initial determination that
the reason to get the restraining order so you are going to
restrain —
QUESTION:

Well, why not just subpoena the material

if you file a civil suit, couldn't you?
MR. PARKER:

Because if you subpoena the material

— well, if you subooena the material, you have judicial
delay, you have the problem that if you subpoena you have
to have a reason to subpoena it, so you have to have initial
determination —
QUESTION:

Why do you need a reason to subpoena if

you have got a couple of copies that are obscene?
MR. PARKER:

But then you are going to have to

subpoena the other copies which are in the store and you
haven't reviewed them initially yet, unless you get a judge
to go in and initially review them so you have probable cause
to —
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

You don’t have discovery in New York?
No, vre could not —
You don't have discovery in New York?
We couldn't discover it like that.

We

would have to have a judge initially review it, get a tempo­
rary restraining order to maintain the status quo and then
join issue, and that is really what we did here.

We took it,

57
we temporarily had it in our possession and the issue was
joint.
QUESTION:

In the State of New York, is there any

other procedure that allows a magistrate to do what was done
her e ?
MR. PARKER:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don’t follow,

when you say —
QUESTION:

Well, when you have got a bucket shop run­

ning, can the magistrate go to the bucket shop-and open up the
books and look at them?
MR. PARKER:

I believe if you have a booking shop,

the magistrate would not have to because the

police officer

could do that.
QUESTION:

I didn't say a booking shop, I said a

bucket shop.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Bucket?
Yes, where you sell stocks and bonds over

the telephone.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

Okay.
Is there any other place that you can go

in like this other than a pronographic store?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

I would think a judge would have a —
Give me one now, let me see which one

you come up with.
MR. PARKER:

There is nothing written by statute,

58
but I think a judge —
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

That ’ s right.
That’s correct, it is not written in

statute.
QUESTION:

For example, you wouldn’t go to a race

track in Goshen and do that, would you?
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

To go in there and —
In Goshen, you wouldn't go to that race

track and go in there and seize all their books, would you?
MR. PARKER:

If what they were doing, if there was

probable cause to believe —
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

That they were selling dirty books?
Or if they —
What other things?
Well, let’s assume that the race track

was illegally gambling, taking bets illegally.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Name me an instance where it happened.
I cannot name you another instance,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Any place in New York?
I cannot name you another instance that

I am personally aware of.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:
Your Honor.

Any place else in the United States?
I cannot name you an Instance of that,
