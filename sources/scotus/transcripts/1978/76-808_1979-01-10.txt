MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-808*, Ambach and others against Norwich and ethers.
Mrs. Gordonf you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JUDITH A. GORDON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. GORDON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The principal question presented on this appeal is
whether the equal protection clause requires New York t©
stop qualifying permanent public school teachers in terns ©f
citizenship or application for citizenship.
This New York requirement is statutory? it is
codified ia education law Section 3001-3.

it operates only

with respect to elementary and public school teachers, and it
asks for applications for citizenship only from immigrant aliens
who have the legal capacity to accept or reject the request.
Other provisions of what appellants believe is a
finely honed state program psrirdt aliens to receive temporary
certificates $ in certain circumstances„

For example, if an

alien is under federal disability and for that reason cannot
apply for citizenship, ha can receive a temporary certificate
during the duration of those disabilities for up to five
years.
If, as another example, an alien is an exchange teacher

4
teaching in New 'fork publi© schools as an esc amp la of his mm
national culture,, he also obtains a temporary certificate
for up to two years.
The undisputed fasts in this ease placa the
appellees at the ecre of the statutory requirement for
citizenship or application for citizenship,

Mrs, Norwich

has

been a permanent resident alien in the United States for 14
years,

Mrs. Dachinger has been a permanent resident alien

in the United States for 13 years.
During the entirety of that period, and by fore® @f
their legal status, they hams the capacity to acquire citizen­
ship .
Both of those individuals, both appellees, and
there is no class action order in this case, both appellees
sought, under state law what are called
certificates.

"N through Sw

The certificates that — pardon me, "N through

3" certificates, the certificates that permit a teacher to
teach each and every grade from nursery through sixth grade,
and in the circumstances where tha classroom teacher is
responsible for teaching all of the subject matter within
those grades,
QUESTIONj

Mrs, Gordon,, does the state concede that

tbasc people, except for alienage, are fully qualified?
MRS, GORDONs

Yes, Your Honor, a caveat in the record

Which 1 should perhaps ©all to your attention, and that is,

s
in addition t© the appropriate citizenship requirements,
there are other grounds for obtaining provisional as distinguished
from permanant certificates»
Mrs. Norwich, at the outsat of the casa, was denied ~
or not the outsat of this case, pardon ma? the outset of her
application to the state authorities — was denied even a
temporary — pardon m®, a permanant certificate, because she
had not completed the educational requirement for that
certificates, namely, a master's degree.
That aspect of tha case was cured during its pendency
•y^.

below, because she did, in fact, get the master's certificate.
So she would be qualified under state law except for the
failure to comply with Education Law 3001-3»
QUESTIONs

On© other question and I'll let yon g©6

In the Appendix on page 2S, there9® a statement
under Rule &(g).
MRS. GORDON %
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Do the appellants accept that as true and

correct?
MRS. GORDON?

Yes, Your Honor.

accepted it as true, but if

If -- we have

-the implication of your question

is that in accepting that statement, the offer of proof which
is set forth at page 33 of the Appendix following was inap­
propriate , than we would dispute that,»
Appellants contend that Section 3003 must b®

g
sustained under the equal protection clause, regardless of
whether the statute is subjected to related or to striet
prudence.
The statute serves the state's substantial purpose
in training pupils for their responsibilities as citizens.
It does so fey the most effective and least drastic means
available.

It includes those who are willing to accept the

responsibilities they must impart, namely, individual partici­
pation in democratic decision-making? and it excludes ©sly
those individuals who have refused to participate, and who
have by that very choice placed themselves at odds with the
instructional purposes the statute carries out.
Appellees do not refute the proposition that public
education in fact trains pupils for citizenship.

They also do

not dispute the additional proposition that public education
through this training has been a force for social cohesion in
the United States, forging, as it ware, one nation out of the
various immigrants who settled this country, and who continue
to come here today.
Indeed, we do not think the appellees could suc­
cessfully refute that proposition, in face of this Court9 s
oft-repeated statement that the principal purpose, if not the
overriding purpose, of public education is in fact training
for citizenship.
QUESTIONs

They are authorised to serve on the school

1
boards that hire teachers?
MBS. GORDON:

Yes* Your Honor? well* not exactly*

Your Honor.
Appellees point out* a® an example of inconsistency
with the statutory program here involved* that in New York City
and in New York City only* aliens have been entitled to vote
in so-called community board elections and to sit as members
of thes community school boards.
Thera are essentially 32 ©f those school boards.
This entire program* when first enacted in 1969*
and is an educational experiment* as we9va showed in Exhibit A
of our reply brief* again before the legislature in terras ©f
the validity or success of the experiment.
Now* in voting in that kind of an election* and
sitting on a school board* the alien who votes or sit© doe©
nothing inconsistent with this statutory program* because
3001 is the overriding or supervening state statute which
qualifies all elementary and public school teachers in New
York State* and with respect to which that alien member
of the school board can do nothing? he does not vhave the
discretion to change or affect the role -model example of the
teacher in the classroom as a member of that board.
QUESTION s'

One other question:

Ha® New York ever

attempted to impose this requirement on teachers in private
schools?

8
MRS. GORDON?
QUESTIONS

No, Yoiar Honor.

Is there a reason for that?

MRS. GORDONs

I think so, Your Honor? I think in

fast the choice is constitutionally compelled.
The fact that Hew York views, as this Court has
viewed, public education as the agency,, or primary agency,
*

through which citizenship is developed, does not mean, by any
stretch of the imagination that private schools do, or should
serve the same interest.
In fact, private schools are acknowledged t© be ~
and have in opinions of this Court been acknowledged ■=« to
serve quite differant interestsy largely, religious interests.
And they operate in a context where those interests are —
become paramount to other interests it serves.
Indeed, for example, in New York city, we have
private schools that operate along the lines of national
interestsj the Lyes© Franchise, which teaches a curriculum
entirely in French, leading to a French baccalaureate degree,
in preparation for European — further education in European
universities, or perhaps, in American univerisities.

10
QUESTION;

But Mrs.

Gordon f

is it not true that the

privat® schools, both religious and secular „ have as part of
thair mission training the pupils for eitisenship?
And in fast, doesn’t the state require certain coarse
content in order to fulfill that objective?
MRS. GORDON %

I think tie response must be fraffled in

the following way, Your Honor»
has been

It is public education that

accorded the principal responsibility fo

for eitisenship.

training

Public education in Mew York is a matter ©£

state constitutional perogative and protection.
Private school is not.

But of course, the state has

an interest in the kind of curriculum and the kind of
instructions in that — in those private schools.

And the

citate does by statute., which ws recite in our opening brief,
require that the instruction in those schools be substantially
equivalent.
I call to your attention, it does not require it to
be the sane, and there is no suggestion in statutory plan that
the q- .-.ality of instruction for the purpose of training for
citizenship is the same.

The curriculum requirements, the basic

curriculum requirements, the twelve common branches in elementary
school, and some additional courses in secondary school, are
generally required under the substantial equivalent formula,
in both public and private schools.
Courses in history are included in both public and

11
privata schools.
However, in terms of curriculum, the state does
speak differently to its own public schools.

For example, it

requires in public schools but not in private schools —
QUESTIONt

Well, even though there are difference©,

is not the reason for the regulation of the private schools
the state's interest in being sura that all children are
properly trained for citizenship?
Isn't that the overriding objective, and the reason
for the regulation?
MRS. GORDON %

Frankly, Your Honor, no, 1 don't think

so.
1 think the state’s predominant interest for public

education is in fact training for citizenship.
QUESTION3

I think —

Well, why do they regulate private schools

at all, then?
MRS. GORDON:

Because there is a fundamental interest

for the state in seeing that certain standards, educational
standards, are met* that children who go through a..course should
be able to read and write.
But that doesn’t say that the agency that is looked

to for this purpose is the — is predominantly the private
school.

It is, in fast, the public school.
«.Md perhaps most significantly, to the extent ‘that

the religious preferences of parents might be impeded by the

12
same identical regulation of private schools, then of course
it would seem to me that th© state has acknowledged that, and
has said, no, we will stop short of that? we will let the
parent who chooses & different kind of education for Ms child
have the full benefit ©£ th© instruction that goes along with
it..
Mid the state says that is fine? only minimum
curriculum standards should be safe»
QUESTION?

Mrs. Gordon, why do you think you used

t© assert the idea that private schools do not have as part
of their mission training for citizenship?
You don't have to defend the statute of New York
on fell®

grounds that it's perfect, or that it’s perfectly

consistent.

People who whave a private school, who want
«

private schools, just as we have religious schools.
But as Justice Stevens suggested, there are certain
minimum requirements which are common to all of ‘them.
MRS. GORDON %
QUESTIONS

That is correct, Your Honor.

But there's :io constitutional requirement

that state statutes have to be internally consistant, is
there?
MRS. GORDON:

Well, Your Honor, that brings us t© the

question, in this ease?, which is whether or not we would apply
the rational basis test, and sustain the statute that way under
the Fourteenth Amendment, or whether we would apply strict

13
scrutiny.
The fore® of my argument hare today is largely
directed to sferiet serutiny, because of course,, if the
statute survives that test, it must perforce survive the
rational basis test.
Mid accordingly, I directed ray answers in that vein.
But equally, Your Honor, wa have taken a position in

our brief which we by n© means eschew, and that is that the
appropriate test is ©a© of reasonable relation? and that is
because training for citizenship as it has been expressed
as a responsibility ©f the public schools,, is an important
governmental interest, a proposition which appellees don5 fc
dispute, or refute successfully, as 1 read their papers.
And. indeed, tha relationship between the teaehsr as
the individual who was present in the classroom -and who was
the model and the example for the behavior of his.students
ties him closely and reasonably with the execution of that
governmental purpose.
And on those two statements, we think, Your Honors,
frankly, that this statute not only survives reasonable basis
examination, but also strict scrutiny examination.
Given the posture of the case as we perceive it
framed by the arguments offered by appellees, that is, that
they do effectively concede. Your Honor, that training for
citizenship is a primary mission of the public schools, the

14
quastion then becomea whether or not — ©r the sol© question
that remains in the ease is whether or not the selection of
the positive rather than the negative example, as at Section
3301-3 provides, is in fast reasonably ©r necessarily related
to the instructional purpose that the statute serves.
tod I think it is important in this context t©
examine for a moment what the teaching and learning process is
about.

Teachers do not merely teach by recitation from a

text, if they ever did so? and students do not learn by rote.
Studies, which again, appellees do not seriously
oppose, speak to the point that, teachers transmit attitudes
and values, as well as information by their own examples.
The pupils under their control and jurisdiction copy and
emulate those attitudes.
And those -- the very attitude that is transmitted
QUESTION:

Mrs, Gordon, what are some of the attitudes

and values that the citizen has that the plaintiffs in this
case do not have?
MRS. GORDON:

The citizen has the capacity t©

participate in democratic decision-making.

That is the

attitude arid the value that is thought to be transmitted ~
QUESTION:

You mean, he can vote?

MRS. GORDON:
QUESTION2

He can vote,

Well, these people can participate in

debate, I suppose, which is part of the democratic decision-

15
making.
Maybe the answer is to let aliens vote,
MRS, GORDON:

Well, I don9fc, think that based on Stan-

?

ford v. Rural Exports that that would be likely, Your Honor,
:

QUESTION:

A state could do it? soma states have,

MRS. GORDON:

Some states have historically, but not

for a very long time, in my understanding.
QUESTION:

Do you have any requirement in>New York

that your teachers must vote in order to hold their jobs?
v.V' '•

MRS0 GORDON:

An interesting point, Your Honor,

I think if we had such a requirement, it would
,.V •

probably be in violation of the First, Amendment, because after
all, I think the concept embodied there includes the right to
remain silent as well as the right to express oneself.

QUESTIONs

If a teacher fulfills your requirement,

th® teacher could also be a policeman, couldn't he?
MRS. GORDON:

That's right.

And one of the — the

regard for the assumption of those kinds of public duties is
the kind of attitude and value which is sought to b© imparted,
And when w© suggest that the value is democratic
decision-making, and also regards to public duty, we do not
exclude bringing up children to assume the responsibilities of
policemen, legislative, and judges.

That is exactly what th®

force of public education is.
I think, as I've bean attempting to point out, that

16
it must be accepted, and it has been accepted in prior
decisions of this Court, particularly with Wisconsin v. foder
most recently, that in fact, teachers do impart principles
by their own examples, by this instruction, from their examples,
of values and attitudes.
1 don’t think that we can find that appellees, even
if they acted in the utmost good faith, could be the kind ©£
example that is consistent with the statute, because essentially,
even if they said that they would select out those attitudes
that they thought would be positive reinforcement of the
eitisenship training they are attempting to provide, they could
not effectively do so, because no individual can consciously
select those attitudes and values which they will convey*
Teachers convey the body of their attitudes all of
the time and in all of the courses that they teach.
Thank you,,

1 will reserve a few minutes for

rebuttal.

OBAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE J. ENNIS, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

Appellants arguments here, and in this brief, largely
ignore the particular facts of this case?

and even unique statutory scheme, and the narrow and rather
'traditional legal theory that was the basis for the
unanimous judgment below.
Many of the issues raised by appellants need not b@
resolved in order fc© affirm the judgment below.

For example ,

this Court could assume, as did the court below, that New York
might have a legitimate interest in preventing soma aliens
from teaching some subjects at some grsde levels, and never­
theless conclude, as did the court below, that this particular
statute is not necessary t© protect that interest, and is
impermissibly under and overinclusi ve.
The statute is under-inclusive because it doss not
require citizenship for even declarant status for teachers in
private schools who teach 13 percent of the elementary and
secondary school population in New York State.
'

Under New York law, private school teachers —
QUESTIONi

Nell, isn’t there a difference?

He do

not permit — the constitution does not permit teaching
religious subjects in the public schools, but it fully
protects the right to teach religious subjects in private
schools.
MR. ENNISs
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

The question here is «—

That seems to me — somewhat dissolves

the point you're making.
MR. ENNIS:

Well, I think not, Your Honor, for the

following reasons s
The question is not whether New York would b©
constitutionally required to require teachers in private
schools to teach the principles of democracy, or would be
constitutionally prevented from doing so.
That is siot at issue in this ease®

Thea Hew York

State legislature has chosen t© require teachers in private
schools to teach the principles of democracy, which shows
that the state has an interest, whether it9s a constitutional
interest or not is not an issue in this case, but it shows
that the state has an interest in requiring private school
teachers to teach the principles of democracy.
But if it is not necessary to insure that private
school students learn the principles of democracy to apply —
QUESTION?

Parents have a choice about sending their

children to private schools.»

They have no choice about

sanding their children to a public school, do they, under
compulsory attendance laws?
MR. ENNISs

That9s entirely correct, Your Honor.

But

it is also true in New York that parents have no choice, at the
present time, whether their private school students are
taught the principles of democracy or not.

It is required by

New YOrk statute that private school students are taught
those prineiples.
Our point here is simply that if citizenship or

19
declarant status is not necessary to insure that private
school students learn those principles, it is not necessary
fc© insure that public school students learn those principles .
QUESTION:

But isn®t it possible that New York may

have felt it was presented'with conflicting claims with
respect t© private schools?

That ia, their desire for

autonomy,, and let, them run themselves, but at the same time,
they have to fulfill some ©f the functions of public schools?
And so thay choose t© go just halfway with privat®
schools, prescribe the curriculum, but not ride herd on who
might teach?
MR. ENNIS:

Again, Your Honor, we are not saying in

this case that New York is required by the constitution to have
exactly identical requirements for public school and private
school teachers.
Th© point X‘m simply making is that th© Mew York
State legislature has already by statute required that the
principles of democracy be taught by private school teachers.
The New York legislature would clearly have the
constitutional authority, in ray opinion, if it chose t© do
such, t© require thatprlv&te school teachers meet the same
minimum qualifications as the public school teachers #md
that would include the seme citizenship or declarant status
requirement.
QUESTION?

Nell, th© point I was trying to make to

20
you In ray question was that New York could, with equal
constitutional validity, decide to stop short with privat®
schools ef going as far ass it did with public schools, and
saying that with public schools, we will require both teaching
democratic citsenship, and citizenship or declarant alien
status for teachers? but with private schools, wa911 simply
require the curriculum content,

let the private schools

choose the teachers themselves.,
KRe ENNISs

Your Honor, the point I’m trying to make

is not that there is a separate and independent equal pro­
tection violation, because of the different citizenship requireB&ints for private® schools teachers and public school teachers*®.
The point I'm simply making is that the 3tate has
already indicated it has an interest, a state interest, in
making sura that private school students learn the principles
of democracy.

And the state apparently believes that it cm

fulfill that interest, at least in the private schools,
without also requiring citizenship or declarant status, for
the private school teachers.
QEUSTIONs

But isn't it an equally rational

inference that the state perhaps felt that private schools
would not be quite as sure of fulfilling that interest but
nonetheless, in the interests of preserving autonomy of a
private

school, chose not to foros them, they way they chose

to fore© the public schools?

21
MR. ENNIS:

Welly Your Honor, that9s entirely a

matter of speculations
QUESTION:
MR. ENNIS:

Yes»
Thera9a nothing in the record ©f this

ease* or in the legislative history of either of those
statutes, that could properly answer year question on that
point.
QUESTION:
MR. ENNIS:

I agree, it*3 speculative.
I think that entirely apart from the

private school point, this statute is ala© under-inclusive,
because under a regulation issued by appellants, aliens who
are barred by a federal statute from becoming citizens, or
even from filing declarations of intent to become citizens,
are nevertheless permitted, in some circumstances, to teach
even in the public schools.
I think the statute is over-inclusive, because it
applies to any ©lien from any country, and prevents that
alien from teaching any subject at any grade level.

It

therefore applies to aliens such as appellees, who are willing
to fckaci; an oath to support the stata and federal constitution,
and who have actually taught the principles of democracy in
New York9a prviate schools.
It applies to aliens such as appellees who are
married to United States citizens, who are the parents ©£
Uh'i'tM States citizens, wh® hav@ resided here for well over

22
a decade* and who even received their graduate education in
New York's public university.
•The statute applies t© aliens from countries wh©ss
political traditions and valtaas are indistinguishable, if
not much the sain®, m ®ur own.

For example, Appellee Nerwiek

was b@m in Scotland, and is a citizen of Great Britain.
Even if wa assume that the state does hav© an
interest in preventing, for example, Russian citizens from
teaching civics, must it prevent French citizens from teaching
French, or Canadian citizens from teaching math or metalwork,
in order to protect that interest?
Finally, despit© appellants6 erroneous claim that
it was only dicta, a reading ©f Kay v8 Board off Education
shows that the Mew York courts have squarely held that the
citizenship requirement, quote, is not limited to elementary
and secondary schools, and the court therefore holds that
Bertrand Russell is not qualified to teach in City College by
reason of the provision of this section, close quotes.
Your Honor, one of the important ~ Your Honors, one
of the important questions in this case is the appropriate
standard for review.

Mow, we believe that even under a

rational basis standard, this statute is not necessary and
would not survive.
for example, it cannot rationally be supposed that an
alien who, ©n the first day ©£ residence in this country,

23
files a declaration ©£ intention, and is thereupon permitted
to teach in New York9® public schools for five years, know
mere about this country’s values and 'mores, share those
values and morea, and be batter able to teach them ~

QUESTIONs

Well, you’re really arguing for a

perfectly tailored statute now, aren’t you?
MR» ENNIS;

QUESTIONS

No, Your Honor ~

It’s always easy to take any statuta in

any area and, under the scrutiny of a litigated case, think
about ways that it could be made more nearly ideal.
MR. ENNIS s

That’s comet. Your Honor.,

We1re not arguing for a perfect match here, but I
do believe, based on the factors identified in our brief, that
this particular statute is substantially and impermissibly
under- and over-inclusive.

It’s not just that there is a

small difference, but that there is a great difference; a
difference of constitution©! significance.
QUESTION:

You’ve used the word "necessary to obtain

the state objective."
Do you really mean that?

That’s the terminology of

strict scrutiny.
MR. ENNISs

Well, certainly that’s the terminology

of strict scrutiny.
QUESTION;
MR. ENNIS %

I thought you were arguing rational basis.
I’m arguing both, Your Honor.

But let

24
me turnto that point and say to the Court why I believe striet
scrutiny is, in fact, the appropriate standard to be applied
in this ease.
QUESTION?

But I thought you just said 'that ©vest

under the rational basis standards, you would think the
statute invalido
MR. ENNISs
QUESTION^
'“necessary.,J

I did say that, Your Honor,
But in that context you used the word,

Was that a slip of the tongue?

MR. ENNISs

Well, actually not, Your Honor, because

the previous alien eases ©f this Court, including, for example,
Foley, which was decided on the rational basis grounds, state
in e, footnote in Foley, the majority opinion, that even if the
state is legislating to define its political community, the
statute cannot sweep indiscriminately? that it must make
careful choicas.
Whether wa choose the word, necessary choices, or
over- cr under-inclusive, I think, is not particularly
appropriate.
We ware talking about aliens who historically have
been a suspect class, deprived of the right to vote, political
powers.

I think that kind of scrutiny by this Court is

warranted.
But let me turn t© the

point ©f why 1 think it’s

clear that strict scrutiny is in fast required in this case.

25

Very recently, is Hyguisfe v. Maude t, this Court
ruled that statutes which limit benefits to citizens or fc©
declarant aliens must be strictly scrutinized„
Now, that was a 5 to 4 decision, but it has net
been overruled —
QUESTIONs
MR. ENNISs

It was also higher education, was it not?
It was financial assistance for higher

education.
QUESTIONS
MR. ENNISs

Graduate -- indeed, graduate education.
That's correct, Y©ur Honor,

And as 2

believe you pointed out, in your opinion in that ease, was that
was & lesser interest of the plaintiffs involved than would
b® the interest in this case, which is a right to employment,
which you describe in that ease a3 a fundamental personal
interest,
The interest in Foley was simply an additional
benefit, financial assistance for graduate education, whereas
the interest in this case is actually the right to employment.
QUESTIONj

You have them reversed, 2 think; Mauelet

and Foley.
HR. ENNISs

I ha sorry.

I was talking about Mauelet,

Your Honor.
At any rate, 1 think that Maudet is indistinguishable
on that point, and therefore, unless this case falls within
the political community exception, first suggested in

Sugarm&n, and first applied in Foley , a strict scrutiny
standard should apply»
I think feher® ar© at least six reasons which
distinguish this ease from Foley.

But before discussing those

specific reasons, I would like to make on® point not made in

local community school boards, who under a New York statute,
have the authority to hire and fire and select teachers, to
specify the curriculum, to select textbooks and other
instructional materials, and quote, to generally manage and
operate the schools.

MR. ENNISs

Well, Mr. Justice Powell, let me

make it clear that social scientists do not yet know whether

MR, ENNISs

No, Your Honor, I have no intention to

take away that statutory authority that New York has.
QUESTION s

Then why are you hare?

If you*re not trying to take away this statutory
authority, as the three-judge court did.
MR. ENNISs

Excuse me, Tour Honor, I thought you were

talking about the statutory authority which permits alien®

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. ENNISs

Mr. Justice Powell, 1 know of your

not going to quarrel with you on how these things happen.
QUESTION:

You have to listen to a whole lot ©f

organisations objecting to different books.
MR. ENNISs

I guess that's correct, too.

Let me say this, that even if that point is not
dispositive, I think there are at least else grounds why this
case is readily distinguishable from Foley.
First, the majority in Foley expressly reaffirmed
at two points in the opinion earlier eases requiring close
scrutiny when aliens are excluded, as? in this ease, from
quote, licensed professions, ©lose quote.
Second, the majority also stressed that the office
of & policeman is in no sense cae of the common occupations

of the community, close quote, but teaching is the third most

3i
eoitisBosa occupation ia H@w York Stat®, ©v@n more common than
laborers, and is apparently the largest category of publi©

employment.
QUESTIONs

Yon think "common” has been used

In

these decisions and ©pinions of tfe© Court in terms ©£ a
h@ad count?
MR. ENNIS:
elaborated

Well, Your Honor, the Court has never

on ©vastly what it does mean by common occupations,

but that is certainly an important point.
cases decided by this Court
quoted that provision ©£

At least four

in feh@ last five years have

Truax v.

Raich

which talked about

common occupations, and that was relied upon, for example,
in Griffiths, involving lawyers.

And the Court apparently

thought that lawyers war® a common occupation, even though
they are not as numerous as teachers.
Third, appellants do not dispute the New York ©as®
law and the opinions ©£ the New York Attorney General, which
expressly holds that teaching is not a public office, and
that teachers ar© employees, not officers, and do not quote,
exercise any sovereign power.
In that connection I think it's worth noting that
the state * a brief in Foley stressed that state police were
designated public officers, not employees.
Fourth, the majority in Foley also stressed that,
quote, most states expressly confine the employment of police

32

officers to citizens, ©lose quote.
But even a genes, ous reading of Exhibit C fe© the
state’s reply brief shows that over three»fourths of the
states do not require citizenship or even declarant status
to teach in public schools in those states.

those don't do so because they fear there’s a constitutional
problem,» about fifty-fifty on the policy choice,
MR. ENNISs

Well, Your Honor, I would like to say two

things about that.
First, it is of course entirely speculative why
ten states in the last few years have abandoned previous
requirements for citizenship or declarant status.

We don’t

really know why.
But to the extant the states would be right about

MR, ENNISt

Well,, Your Honor, I’ve argued a lot ©f

cases against attorneys general, out I would like to say that
I don't think they can all be wrong all the time.
And if the unanimous opinion of all these attorneys
general is that this Court's previous decisions do not bring
teachers within the political community section discussed in
Sugarman, I think that itself is entitled to some weight in
deciding what the law in this country is.
Fifth ~
QUESTION:

That's what the dissent in Foley thought,

too.
MR. ENNISs

Correct, Your Honor.

Fifth, alien attorneys do not come within the politi©®!
community exception to strict scrutiny —
QUESTION s

Dissent in one of the concurrences, I

might add,
MR. ENNISs

— and it follows that teachers do net,

because lawyers share more of the characteristics of police
thought relevant in Foley then do teachers.
Ab this Court noted in re Primus, the interests of

34

the states in regulating lawyers is especially great, sine®
lawyers are essantialy to the primary governmental function of
administering justice, and have historically been officers of
the court.

And as this court noted in Griffiths, like police,
lawyers can invade individual privacy through issuance ©£
subpoenas and compelled depositions; indeed, the Court noted
that lawyers can even, quote, command the assitanca ©f
police.
Finally, teaching is not a governmental monopoly.
All of the alien cases to date in which this Court has not
applied strict scrutiny, or has ruled that citizenship is a
permissible requirement, involved governmental monopolies.
You, cannot have private voting for state or federal
officials; or private jury trials? or private state police.
But you can have

private teachers.

Isn't teaching in a public school a

governmental monopoly?

It is somewhat analogous, Your Honor.

You can define the question so it comes

out in your favor, but I don't know that it helps you.

QUESTION:

Doesn't this statute do just that, as Mr.

Justice Stevens suggested?

It applies only to the governmental

monopoly over public schools of a limited category ? public
primary — not higher education.
MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, the point I'm trying to

make is that the Court should focus on the actual function

36

involved.
Of course we could have private security police.
But the function of teaching is not a governmental monopoly.
In fact, this Court ruled in the Rodrigues case that teaching
is not only not a governmental monopoly, but it’s not even a
fundamental right.
There is no constitutional right, even, to a public
education,
QUESTION;

But that doesn't change the fact — that,

doesn’t alter the fact thatit’s a governmental monopoly to
teach public schools, does it?
The fact that there’s no enforceable right to have
a public school, if that’s the case,
MR. ENNIS;

Your Honor, I think the critical point

here is not whether the state has chosen to make its regu­
lations applicable to both public and private ch,schools.

It

could make the application applicable to private schools.
The point is that the function of teaching has
never been thought in this country to be a function that can
be reserved only to the public sector, and can be performed
only by the public sector.
Previous decisions of this Court — Pierce v. Society
of Sisters and others — recognized that there is a privates
right to teach and to learn, and 'chat it is not a government
monopoly.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Ennis, do you happen to know what

percentage of the New York State budget is devoted to public
education?
MR. ENNISs

I do not know that, Your Honor.

All I

know on that point is that 18 percent of the students in
elementary and secondary schools are in private schools.

I

do not know the government —
QUESTIONS

In most states, education is the single

largest item in the state budget; that may not be true in
New York, in view of your welfare load.
MR. ENNIS;
Your Honor.

I don’t know the answer to that question,

But I think it does raise a point that I began

with, and that is, the New York statutory scheme is a
relatively unique scheme, includiig the statute which permits
aliens to serve on school boards.
And I think the decision of this Court need not be
any broader than the New York statutory scheme; would not
have to apply necessarily to the teaching profession in other
states.
I would like simply to make one other point;

lant has stated under oath that they —• appellees have stated
under oath that they are willing to take an oath to support
the state and Federal constitution.

reality, about actual ties to the country based on period of

further, Your Honor.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JUDITH A. GORDON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. GORDON'S

And that is, that it is completely

immaterial to this classifying plan where the alien comes
from, whether he comes from Cambodia, or whether he comes
from Finalnd or Great Britain.
Because so long as he has the capacity to choose
citizenship and refuses to do so, he manifests a negative
example that, the statute seeks to avoid.
As to the rest of the argument made by the appellees,
v?e think that they ara appropriately answered in our reply
brief.
Thank you very much.

Mrs. Gordon, let me just ask one question.

I don't think it's repetitious.

democratic participation that they are trying — excuse me,
trying to advance to their students.
