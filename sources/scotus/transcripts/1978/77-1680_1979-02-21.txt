MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Michigan against DeFillippo.
Mr. Baughman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court s
Before I discuss the question of the constitutional­
ity of the Detroit Stop and 3!dentify Ordinance I would first
like to discuss whether the constitutionality of that ordinance
is necessarily relevant to the ultimate issue in this case
and that is whether or not the phenyclidene seized from
Respondent is admissible against him in a trial for possession
of phenyclidene and the facts are these:
1

On September 14th, 1976 at approximately 10:00 p.nu ,
f

two Detroit police officers answered a radio run to investi­
gate a complaint regarding two persons drunk in an alley by
a garage.

As they pulled their scout car into the alley in

quest.on, they observed Respondent and a woman who was in the
process of taking her pants down.
They drove on into the alley and while seated in
the scout car, directed questions to these persons.
woman stated that she had to go to the bathroom

The

d

Respondent was asked for identification and stated
that he was Sergeant Mash,
and he gave a number.

He was asked for his badge number

He 'was again asked for identification

and this time stated that he worked for Sergeant Mash,
At this point the female approached the scout car
and she was asked for identification.

Her response was to

dump the contents of her wallet through the open police car
window onto the lap of the officer who was seated inside.
She was then arrested for disorderly conduct because of her
intoxicated condition.
Respondent was arrested for a violation of a
Detroit ordinance for refusing to identify himself.

He was

searched and on his person a quantity of marijuana was found.
Also taken frcm him was a package of cigarettes and in that
package the officer observed a tinfoil Packet.
That packet was ultimately determined to contain
for
a quantity of phenyelidene and it was/possession of phenyclidene that Respondent was ultimately charged.
He was bound over for trial in Detroit Recorders
Court and a motion to quash

the information was brought be­

fore the trial judge and denied.

The Michigan Court of

Appeals granted an interlocutory appeal in order that the
information be quashed and the case dismissed.
QUESTIONS

Is the Recorders Court in Detroit the

court of general criminal jurisdiction?

5
MR, BAUGHMANS

It handles all criminal matters in

the City of Detroit,, both felony and misdemeanor.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Baughman —

MR. BAUGHMAN;
QUESTION;

Yes.

-- you stated that when the Respondent

refused to identify himself he
MR. BAUGHMAN;
QUESTION;

was arrested.

Yes, that is correct.

The ordinance does not provide

for an

arrest in that situation or is that considered to be an arrest?
MR. BAUGHMAN;
dered to be an arrest.

It is our position that it is consi­
The ordinance declares that, it is

unlawful to refuse to identify oneself and an unlawful act
under a general penalty provision of the Detroit City Code
calls for a 90-day penalty and a $500 fine.
QUESTION;

It is under the general code father than

the sentence that says, "In the event the person is unable to
provide reasonable evidence of his true identity the police
officer may transport him to the nearest precinct in order to
ascertain —"

That is not what you rely on.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

That is

correct.

I believe that

is a separate provision from the refusal to identify portion
and I think that is made more

clear by the ultimate revision

of the ordinance by the Detroit City Council, a separate
revision.
QUESTION s

But the revision of the ordinance is

<

'

6

not before us,
MR. BAUGHMAN:

No.

I think the revision only makes

clear what was intended all along.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

The arresting officer had some other

grounds on which to arrest this man, did he not?
MR. BAUGHMANs
QUESTION:

He may have.

He may hame?

he was a police officer?

That has not been

When he represented that

Is it not a crime of some kind in

Detroit and in Michigan for a person to impersonate a police
officer?
MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION;

It is and ~

Well, would that not —

MR. BAUGHMAN:

— he may well have had probable

cause to arrest for false impersonation of a police officer
at that time.

You cannot be convicted of false impersonation

of a police officer in Michigan unless you act as such but
that of course does not mean that there was not probable
cause to arrest but that could not have been convicted so
that may well be true.
QUESTION:

When did the Defendant refuse to identi­

fy himself?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, it

is our position that by

giving a false — an admittedly false answer when he later
changed the answer — that that is tantamount to a refusal to

7
identify.

In this record it appears that he never did state

that he was Gary DeFillippo.
QUESTIONS
I guess.

Oh* yes, looking backwards that is right,

So what if a man

him his name.

if you accost a person and ask

Has he violated the ordinance if it later turns

out that it was false?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, I think if he gave a name then

we would go on to the next portion of
written or

verifiable proof,

oral.
QUESTION;

So that is also a part of the ordinance,

you think?
MR. BAUGHMAN;

Yes.

That point was not reached in

this case because they never got beyond the identification
question.
QUESTION;

Because he gave two different answers.

MR. BAUGHMAN;
QUESTION;

That is correct.

Mr. Baughman, this case is not one of

prosecution for violation of the ordinance, is it?
MR. BAUGHMANS

No, it is not.

This is a derivative

of its case.
QUESTION;

Do you know of any instances in your

city where one has been prosecuted for violating the ordinance?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

I am not personally aware of those.

Those would be fried ~
QUESTIONs

You are a prosecuting attorney, are you

8

not?
MR. BAUGHMAN;
QUESTION;

Yes, I am.

Have you ever prosecuted one?

MR. BAUGHMAN;

No, I have not.

They are not prose­

cuted by the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office.

They are pro­

secuted by the City of Detroit corporation counsel as they are
ordinance violations and not state law violations.

I am not

familiar with whether or not they are —
QUESTION;

Bow would the constitutionality of the

ordinance cnrer be determined if no prosecutions are ever
brought under it?
MR. BAUGHMANs

The only other method would be a

possibility of a suit for declaratory judgment Michigan law
which would be allov/ed.

But I believe that if the issue of

no prosecutions ever being brought under this ordinance would
have to be raised in the trial court by a defendant claiming
that this was his only method of attacking it and that was
not done in this case and I don't think this record demon­
strates whether or not there have been prosecutions —
QUESTION;

Well, except the prosecution has the —

can determine what they want to prosecute for.
MR. BAUGHMAN;

That is correct.

I am just saying

that X — on this record and personally I do not know if
persons have been prosecuted.

They may well have been but

that is within the knowledge of the Detroit Corporation

9
Counsel and I do not know.
Now, it is our position that the phenyclidene
seized from Respondent is admissible against him and that his
arrest was valid, regardless of the constitutionality of the
ordinance.
This Court has stated that the question of the
good faith of the police officers only arises after a consti­
tutional violation has been found, in the question of whether
or not a suppression remedy should be applied but whether or
not a constitutional violation occurred at all turns on an
objective assessment of the officer's actions in light of the
facts and circumstances confronting him at the time he acted»
It is our position when an officer enforces a pre­
sumptively valid penal ordinance, the violation of which has
occurred in his presence, as is his duty, an objective assess­
ment of the facts and circumstances known to him at that time
cannot include that which was not known to him at the time;
that an appellate court would subsequently hold the penal
ordinance to be unconstitutional.
When that legislature enacts the penal ordinance
or statute and ultimately there is determined to be a due pro­
cess defect in that ordinance, this means that a person cannot
be incarcerated pursuant to a conviction for violation of
that ordinance without his 14th Amendment rights being violated,
_

--frflESTIQN:

Due process defect or any defect --

10
MR* BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

Any defect.

-- makes it a violation.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Correct but it does not mean that

when he is arrested for probable cause to believe that he
violated that ordinance by a police officer when the ordinance
is at that time presumed valid, that his Fourth Amendment
rights have been violated.
The Fifth Circuit has held precisely in this manner
in the cases cited in our brief.

In those cases that court

has refused to reach the question of the constitutionality
of the underlying ordinance in derivative evidence cases,
holding that that question is not relevant to the -Fourth
Amendment question and holding that when a person is arrested
for probable cause —
QUESTION:

On what ground did the Court of Appeals

for the Fifth Circuit say there was no Fourth Amendment vio­
lation or that the evidence should not be excluded?
MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor —

You believe if they said the First, why,

they would say the Second, too.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

They said the arrest was valid.

And

saying that the arrest was valid I would take to mean that
they, were saying that there was no Fourth Amendment violation.
They also went on to say that the application of
the Exclusionary Rule in that context would not serve any

11
purpose and ~~
QUESTION:

Even if there had been --

MR. BAUGHMANs

Even if there had been a Fourth

Amendment violation and we take both those positions„
lieve

We be"

there was no Fourth Amendment violation in this case

but that if there was the Fourth Amendment the Exclusionary
Rule should not be applied»
Now, in Almeida-Sanchez this Court did hold that a
Fourth Amendment violation did occur in a case where officers
did act in reliance on a statute which had not been declared
unconstitutional but we believe that the difference there is
that that statute was not a penal statute»

Its sole purpose

t

^^as to authorize searches in certain circumstances,, to authorzie what might be termed Fourth Amendment activity.
Now, this ordinance does have a portion that
authorizes Fourth Amendment activity, the stop of the person.
But we believe that that portion of the ordinance is not at
issue here, either factually or legally.

It is a codification

of Terry v. Ohio and we believe that the facts in the instant
case plainly show grounds for a stop and I do not believe that
any lower court has held to the contrary.
The question is the penal portion of the ordinance,
the substantive offense portion of the ordinance I think is
what is at issue here.
QUESTION:

No, but you certainly must not

only

12

say there is grounds for a Terry stop but there roust have been
grounds for an arrest and a search»
MR. BAUGHMANi

Correct but the ordinance provides

that when one is stopped pursuant to Terry v. Ohio, he
upon request state his identity.

must

It is making the conduct of

refusing to state identity a crime.
QUESTION:

Do you think this — was there ever any

question in this case raised about the grounds for the socalled 18 stop"?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

I do not believe so, no.

I think

what is before the Court is whether the legislature ultimately,
as far as the constitutionality of the ordinance goes, is
whether or not the legislature can make this conduct a crime
but what they did here is create a substantive offense and
we agree

that the legislature cannot make valid conduct

which is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment when they
act procedurally, as in Almerda-Sanehez but where they create
a substantive offense, where the legislature acts pursuant
to its exclusive function of defining crime and ordaining
punishment, whether or not it has drawn the statute constitu­
tionally, whether or not it can prohibit the conduct-it seeks
to prohibit is a 14th Amendment question.

Whether or not the

person was arrested pursuant to probable cause for a violation
of that ordinance is a Fourth Amendment question and we sub­
mit that plainly here there was more than probable cause to

13
believe that Mr. DeFillippo had violated the ordinance.,
There being probable cause, his arrest did not
violate his Fourth Amendment rights and the search of his per­
son incident to that arrest was proper.
Now, if this Court is to hold that the seizure of
Respondent's person was a violation of the Fourth Amendment,
then the inquiry is not over for then consideration of offi­
cial motives is appropriate in determining whether or not the
Exclusionary. Rule should be applied.
How, Justices Powell and Rehnquist in concurring
in Brown v, Illinois that there is no legitimate justification
for depriving the prosecution of reliable and probitive evi­
dence in cases of technical violations of the Fourth Amendment
and they gave as an example when a person is arrested pursuant
to a statute which has not yet been declared unconstitutional.,
Now, we have stated our position that we believe
that this conduct is not even a technical violation of the
Fourth Amendment but if this Court so views it, then we fully
agree that the application of the Exclusionary Rule in this
situation would serve no valid purpose.
QUESTION %

Now, in Stone against Powell, the reason

that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had held that
search to be invalid was that it held the ordinance of, what
was it, Henderson?
MR. BAUGHMANi

That is correct.

14
QUESTION:

In Nevada, the vagrancy ordinance was

an invalid ordinance, that it held it after the fact, after
the search.
MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Did the Court either approve or dis­

approve that reasoning?

Did this Court in stone against

Powell, either approve or disapprove?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

I think the majority did not reach

that question, deciding the case on the habeas corpus issue
instead.

There were concurring opinions which disagreed with

the application of the Exclusionary Rule under those circumstances.
QUESTION:

But the Court rather assumed, did it not,

that it was an illegal search because the vagrancy ordinance
was an invalid ordinance, although the policeman at the time
of the arrest had no reason to believe so.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

I am not .certain.

That may well

have been an underlying assumption of the Court.

I believe

that it stood for the proposition that those kinds of claims
could not be brought from habeas corpus, valid or not.

I

don’t think it really settles whether or not the claim was
valid.
QUESTION:

You do

not think that throws any light

on your question here?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

I do not believe so.

15
QUESTION:

Although that was the fact; was it not,

in Stone against Powell?
MR, BAUGHMAN:

That was the holding of the Ninth

Circuit.
QUESTION:

The reason the Ninth Circuit held that

was an invalid arrest was, the Ninth Circuit, after the fact,
decided it was an invalid ordinance.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Certainly and that demonstrates that

there is a split among the circuits because the Tenth Circuit
held to the contrary.
QUESTION:

And in what case did you mention

Mr. Justice Powell's concurring opinion?
MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

That was in Brown v. Illinois.

And he was the author of Stone against

Powell?
MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:
time of the arrest?

Yes, he was.

May I come back to what happened at the
Did the pat-down occur before or after

the arrest?
MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

After the arrest.

MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

It occurred after the arrest.

Yes.

Now, will you state again exactly what

the issue is before us?
before us in this case?

Is the validity of the ordinance

16

MR. BAUGHMAN:

I believe it is.

It is not necessary,

ultimately,, for this Court to decide that issue to decide that
the pbenyclidene is admissible against Respondent in this case
because this Court could hold that even if the ordinance is
unconstitutional, pbenyclidene is admissible because either
the arrest was valid or because the

Exclusionary Rule should

not apply to this conduct in any event and therefore, not
reach the constitutionality of the ordinance, it then being
irrelevant but -QUESTION:

We could hold that there was probable

cause for this arrest and the search would have been incident
to tha'c arrest and would that and the case?
MR. BAUGHMAN %
QUESTION;

And that is your primary —

MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

I balieve it would.

That is my primary —

— standard, that this is an ordinance

duly enacted by the City of Detroit, that there was a reasona™
foie cause to believe that the Respondent was violating that
ordinance and that therefore, the policeman arrested the
Respondent.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Yes and no Fourth Amendment viola­

tion occurred.
QUESTIONs

And that that, your submission is, is a

valid arrest without reference to whether or not this Court or
some ether court might subsequently find that ordinance to

17
have been invalid.
MR. BAUGHMANs

That is correct.

That is our first

position.
QUESTION:

That is what I thought.

QUESTION?

In other words-, you are standing on the

presumptive validity of the ordinance.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

We are standing on the proposition

that even if a person cannot oe convicted validly for via™
lating a penal statuteP when he is arrested, before that fin­
ding of unconstitutionality occurs, upon probable cause to foeliev^e he violated it, that no constitutional violation has
been committed by the officer.
QUESTION:

If that were not so, I suppose the

officer would be subject later to a suit for unlawful arrest.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

He may have a good faith defense on

the civil suit but a suit may be brought against him.

It is

possible.
QUESTION:

Mr. Baughman, if we were to reach the

constitutional question, do you see any Fifth Amendment prob­
lem here?

You have discussed the Fourth Amendment.

Is

there a Fifth Amendment problem with respect to an ordinance
that allows an officer or makes it a crime to decline to
identify oneself when an officer is arrested for any purpose?
MR, BAUGHMAN:

I do not believe there is a Fifth

Amendment problem here and we rely heavily on the cases from

18
the California courts which are cited in our brief*
QUESTION:

Well, what about Miranda?

MR* BAUGHMAN

In asking someone to identify him­

%

self under these circumstances, the person is not being com­
pelled to give incriminating information.

I think California

v. Byers is somewhat on point although I think the facts are
stronger in this case*

In California v. Byers not only did

the person identify themself, but by so doing they indicated
that they were a person involved in an accident and this
Court indicated there that identification is essentially a
neutral act*
This person is just being asked to identify himself
■ and not indicate that he is
vision.

He does not stand accused.

Byers involved automobile accidents.

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes but it was a criminal violation

In this ;case, the person was just asked to give
their name.

The name is not incriminating.

There are a multitude of ways in which the

government can compel a person to give up their name -- testirnony in a courtroom.
QUESTIONi

A person may be called —
Well, what has been the — what

have

the cases held — or do you know of any cases where there has
been a Terry stop?

Has anyone ever held that as soon as you

make a Terry stop you must give Miranda warnings?
MR. BAUGHMAN;

I am not aware of any such cases.

It is our position that there is not a Fifth Amend­
ment problem because no testimonial information is compelled
from a person in this situation.
Now, it may be possible to conceive of circumstances
where other statutes requiring identification in different
contexts may raise self-incrimination problems, although I am
hard-put to think of any but I do not think that this statute
raises such problems.

I think the California cases are correct

on this point.
QUESTION;

Mr. Baughman, at the time the officer

first approached the Respondent, was there reasonable cause
to believe he was engaged in criminal activity?
MR. BAUGHMAN;

I believe there was reasonable cause

to believe criminal activity was afoot.
QUESTION:

What criminal activity by the Respondent?

MR. BAUGHMAN:

There are several possibilities but

I think the officer had at least a reasonable suspicion that

20

either consenfcual or forcible criminal sexual conduct may have
been afoot.

I think once he observed the Respondent there in

the alley —
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the testimony there

about that?
MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

No, there is not.

That is just your supposition that be­

cause they were there in the alley together he might have
assumed that.

You think that is enough?

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, my supposition from the woman

being in the alley taking her pants down in a flagrant manner.
QUESTION:

But her purpose was explained as some­

thing quite different.
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, of course, that occurred

after the officers made a stop there.
QUESTION:

Well, as soon as they asked her.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

I think the stop had already occurred

at that point in time and under the ordinance then the offi­
cers were entitled to ask for identification.
QUESTION:

Terry authorizes the stop.

MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

On the basis of facts observed by the

officer, does it not?
MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And you are saying that what the

21
officcsr observed gave him all the right to make a Terry
approach.
MR» BAUGHMAN;

That is correct and that the ordi­

nance , then, gave him the right to arrest for the violation of
tb® law that the Respondent would not identify himself.
QUESTION;

Which came later.

Well, the purpose of the stop under Tarry must be
to search the stopee for weapons.
MR. BAUGHMAN;

That assumes also that there is a

further reasonable suspicion that he is armed and dangerous.

— says that you can detain under parti”

a person is dangerous if you suspect an offense.
MR. BAUGHMAN;

Yes, the detention portion of Terry,

I believe, is for investigation.

The frisk only occurs —

and can only occur if there is a further reasonable suspicion
that the person is armed and dangerous and then you can frisk
but the stop is an investigatory stop, I believe.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

In this case, the officers, when

they had the complaint of two drunks in an alley and pulled
into the alley and saw Respondent and a woman taking her pants
down, then I think that two possibilities were consentual or
forcible criminal sexual conduct.

I think they at least had

a duty to proceed into the alley to investigate what was
occurring.

QUESTION:

He was just standing there and he was

fully clothed.
MR. BAUGHMAN;
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Is public drunkeness an offense in

Detroit?
MR. BAUGHMANs
It was at the time.

It is no longer a criminal offense,

There is now a new set of statutes that

deal with that situation.

I would point out that ultimately

it did not appear that Respondent was drunk, just the woman.
QUESTION:

Just the woman?

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Just the woman appeared to be drunk

after the investigation occurred.
I would like to return just for a moment to the
application of the Exclusionary Rule in this case and turn

to

the question of what would not applying the Exclusionary Rule
to these facts mean if this Court were to hold that the arrest
under the ordinance was a violation under the Fourth Amendment.
We submit that it would not result in lawless police
conduct but in police continuing to do their duty, to enforce
the violations of ordinances when they occur.

24

If anything, it would deter police officers to not
act as courts, reviewing legislation before they decide
whether or not to enforce it.
Now, if the rule were to bs applied to these facts,
what would it mean?

I believe that hopefully, its application

should not and would not alter future police behavior, for the
police did that which we would expect them to do and which we
would want them to do in the future.
As Mr. Justice White stated in his dissent in
Stone v. Powe11, that excluding the evidence in these sorts of
circumstances can in no way affect future police conduct un­
less it is to make the officer less willing to do his duty.
Now, this Court, and I think wisely so -- and
legislatures also, have wanted to maximize control over police
officers to reduce as low as possible their area of discretion
without keeping them from operating at all.
We want societal control of their actions.
4-

If the Exclusionary Rule was applied in this case,
exactly the opposite effect would occur than the Exclusionary
rule seeks to achieve for the officers would then have un­
bridled discretion to decide what laws they are going to en­
force before they enforce them and I don’t think that is the
result which the Exclusionary Rule was intended to accomplish.
If, then, there is no effect on future police
behavior, if there is no removal of any inducement to violate

25
the Fourth Amendment and 1 submit plainly there would be no
removal of any inducement in this case,, then suppress in the
truth in a criminal proceeding will occur and nothing will have
been gained*
I would also like to briefly point to the argument
from judicial integrity on which I believe Respondent heavily
relies.

This Court has already held that judicial integrity

is not offended if law enforcement officials reasonably be­
lieve in good faith that their conduct is in accordance with
the law at the time they act, even if subsequent decisions
hold that their conduct was not permitted under the Constitu­
tion and here the police acted as we would want them to act
when a violation of the law occurs in their presence*
Since the trial, then, is the search for truth, to
exclude the truth in the absence of an insolent use of police
authority, in the absence of the achievement of any effect on
future police behavior, 1 submit is itself an affront to
judicial integrity*
Now, we have, for the purposes of argument here,
assumed that the ordinance is unconstitutional but as I have
indicated on the merits, we do not concede that the ordinance
is unconstitutional and I would point out that I believe,
looking at the revision only for clarification purposes, that
it does — the ordinance has three parts*
There is the stop portion which X have discussed*

26

There is a substantive offense portion which makes
it a crime to refuse to identify oneself and also makes it a.
crime to refuse to provide verifiable proof* written or oral*
of that identification»
The inability portion of the statute which Justice
Stevens referred to* I believe* is separate from the criminal
portion»

If a person* rather than refusing to identify him­

self* is unable somehow to provide verifiable proof, he may
be detained until his identification is verified and then he
is to be released.
This portion of the ordinance is very similar to
the Uniform Arrest Act which is cited in our brief which
allows a two-hour detention under similar circumstances and 1
believe that portion is not at issue in this case.
not inability to identify.

This is

This is a refusal to identify case.

Nov;* the key question* it seems to me* is whether
or not. the government can make this conduct criminal* the re­
fusal to identify.

I have already stated that I do not be­

lieve that it is a Fifth Amendment problem.

I think the key

question is whether or not any right of the Respondent is vio­
lated by the government making this conduct criminal.
The only one that comes to mind is possibly a claim
of an interference with the right to privacy.
It is our position that there is a governmental
interest served in allowing -- in making this conduct

27

criminal and I think this is a 14th Amendment Due Process
question»
QUESTIONS

Well, you would not suggest that you

could make it criminal to refuse to give your name to any
officer who just happens to stop you on the street, would you?
MR. BAUGHMANs

No, I would not.

I would point out

that this is a carefully-eircumscribed ordinance which limits
that authority to when there has been a valid Terry stop.
Only in that circumstance can an officer demand identification
and only in that circumstance is it a crime to refuse.

Not

anyone on the street can be stopped.
QUESTIONS

You say the protection against compul­

sory self ■“incrimination is not involved why?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Because the giving of one's name is

a neutral act.
QUESTIONs

Well, it may not be.

I mean, what if

his name is John Dillinger?
MR. BAUGHMANs
QUESTION

%

Well, the fact he was John Dillinger

Would be unlikely now because John

Dillinger has been dead for -MR. BAUGHMANs

Well, that may lead to

his appre­

hension but the fact that ha is identified as the person who
he is is no more incriminating than taking his fingerprints,
his blood, his hair and other -- his handwriting sample or
other activities this Court has held are not testimonial.

\

28

A link in a chain to conviction, as this Court held
in Byers, leading to his apprehension does not mean that the
information he imparts is testimonial and that it can be used
against him.

I do not believe he is compelled to incriminate

himself*, although he is compelled to give information.

Persons

are compelled to give information by the government all the
time .
QUESTION?

Well, are there not cases arising under

the constitutional guarantee against compulsory self-incrimina­
tion which protect a witness from even giving his name?
MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION?

I am not aware of it.

On a witness stand?

MR. BAUGHMAN:

If it is conceivable under the cir­

cumstances that his name alone would incriminate him, I would
suspect that is true.
QUESTIONs

And can you not conceive of such a sit­

uation existing?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Not under these — not under this

sort of —
QUESTION:

If his name was John Dillinger or Ai

Capone or —
MR. BAUGHMAN?

That he is who he is may subject

him to prosecution but his name itself is not an incriminating
piece of evidence.
QUESTION:

In other words, that may furnish

29

probable cause for his arrest but it does not necessarily
incriminate him.

Is that your position?

MR. BAUGHMM3:

That is my position.

I believe that

is what the California courts have held and I think that
California v. Byers would support that proposition.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Baughman*, you seem to assume that if

there were no criminal connection it would be unconstitutional
for the ordinance to require that you authorize a policeman
just to go up to a citizen on the corner out in front of the
courthouse, say, and say, what is your name?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

No, I think any officer can ask

that of any citizen but he cannot arrest —
QUESTION:

Can he make it a crime for the citizen

to refuse to tell him?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

You say it could not.
I do not believe that the legisla­

ture could make it a crime to refuse to answer that question.
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

Upon no other facts.

What is the constitutional objection to

that statute?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, I think that it is just a 14th

Amendment Due Process question is whether governmental interest is served and whether the means employed are reasonably
related to the end.

If the end, as I see it in this case, is

the same end that Terry talks about, effective crime

30

prevention and detection? 1 do not believe that the means em­
ployed in' that case would be reasonably related to achieving
that end and also 1 think that the 14th Amendment Due Process
oases state that the means cannot be unduly oppressive on
individuals and I believe that probably would be unduly
oppressive? if you do not limit it at least to the Terry sit­
uation.
QUESTION s

You would say it is a Due Process ques­

tion ,
MR. BAUGHMAN;

I believe the constitutionality of

tha ordinance is? yes.
QUESTION;

Would not there ba a Fourth Amendment

issue? though? if without any reason whatsoever the officer
went up to a person and detained him while he asked him?
MR. BAUGHMAN;

That would be a Fourth Amendment

question but I do not believe that is what is before us here.
QUESTION;

But if he walked up and walked up along­

side of him and just followed him along and asked him what his
name was.
MR. BAUGHMAN;

That he could do.

I think any

citizen —
QUESTION;

And you can certainly do that.

There is

no problem there but then if he? the person said? "No, I will
not give it to you” and then if he arrested him
then there is a problem.

you think

31

MR, BAUGHMAN:

Then there won Id be a problem,, even

if there was a statute, 1 think,

Certainly without a statute

there would be a problem,
QUESTION?

But you say a statute or ordinance —*

MR, BAUGHMANS
QUESTION %

Yes,
making it a criminal offense for a

person to refuse an inquiry by a police officer, knowing him
to be a police officer, "what is your name?" that that would
be an invalid statute or ordinance?
MR, BAUGHMANs
QUESTIONI

Assuming it without any Terry basis?

Exactly,

MR, BUAGHMANs

Just anybody on the street.

I am not saying it would for certain,

It may

I think there would be

much more problems v/ith that ordinance than there would be
with this one,
QUESTIONS

But why?

Why?
V

MR, BAUGHMAN:

Because I do not -- because the end

of effective crime prevention and detection I do not think
would be reasonably related to the means, stopping anyone on
•'

\

the street to ask them their name^ as it is in this qase and
I think that might be unduly oppressive on individuals , which
is also a Du© Process test,
QUESTION^

Do you think while the draft was in

force that it was a violation —
MR, BAUGHMAN:

No

32
QUESTION:

-- if an officer walked up to somebody

and said* "Let me see your draft card" and the person said*
"Awfully sorry but it is none of your business"?

Do you think

that there was a statute that made that a crime?

Would that

be it?
MR, BAUGHMAN:

No, there may be — there is a dif­

ferent government interest served there when you have a request
for a certain document.

It is not effective crime prevention

and detection that is being served in that case.

It is the

enforcement of the draft laws and that might be a different
circumstance.
QUESTION:

Well, the Court of Appeals of Michigan

in this ease said what was wrong with it, sort of, was that
it seeks to make criminal conduct which is innocent.

But that

is true o£ every criminal statute.
MR. BAUGHMAN:
QUESTION:

Yea.

It is innocent to drive over 55 miles an

hour on a highway until a statute tells you it is criminal,
is it not?
MR. BAUGHMAN:

That is correct.

Any lawmaking

conduct which is not mal a mense criminal, makes criminal
/

conduct which is innocent so I do not see the point of the
Michigan decision in that regard.
QUESTION:

Well, that is really —

MR, BAUGHMAN:

I think that is one reason why we

33

are here.
QUESTION %

your answer as to the doubtful vali-

dity of a statute such as you have hypothecated, that it makes
criminal conduct which, before this ordinance was passed, was
innocent conduct.
MR. BAUGHMAN;
QUESTIONs

Yes, that is so.

Why is that?

I mean, is that not true

of every criminal statute?
MR. BAUGHMAN;

Yes, it is.

It is true of every

criminal statute.

some Lind.
MR. BAUGHMAN %

That is correct.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JAMES C. HOWARTH, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. HOWARTH;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
The position of the Respondent in this case which
was also the position of the Michigan Court of Appeals and a
position not reached by the.Michigan Supreme Court, is that
th© particular case before the bar involved the warrantless
search of an individual American citizen by the name ©£ Gary
DeFiHippo who in September of 1916 was standing harmlessly on

34

a back street of DetroitQUESTION s

In making that statement

By doing that they were rejecting the

Terry type of situation, were they not?
You are saying this was not a Terry stop.
MR. HOWARTH:

Certainly it was not a Terry stop.

It was. -QUESTIONS

What time of the day or night was this?

MR. HOWARTHs

Ten p.m.

It was at ten o’clock at

night but it was made very clear in the cross-examination of
the police officer, Officer Bednark, at the preliminary
examination that there was no fear of weapons, that the
arrest was being made for no other reason, other than the
fact that Mr. DeFillipo did not satisfy the particular stan­
dards of that- police officer regarding his identification.
We would submit that the statement of facts which
Mr. Baughman has presented to the Court, while those state­
ments can be interpreted from the fact, it can also be inter­
preted from the somewhat sketchy record before us that
Mr. DgiFillippo did indeed attempt to identify himself.
I would like to clarify that.

Certainly,

Mr. DeFillippo, in a city the size of the City of Detroit
would not know the police officer personally.

By stating

to

Officer Bednark, ”1 am Gary DeFiHippo," if he certainly did
not have with him a driver’s license, that statement would
certainly not satisfy this ordinance if Officer Bednark said,

35

"Well, 1 don't know that you are Gary DeFillippo.
have some piece of identification, a draft card»
have a birth certificate»

You don't
You don't

You don't have a credit card."

Blow, Gary DeFillippo allegedly talked about the
subject of a Sergeant Mash.

The question, I think, that re­

nte- ins unresolved is what did Gary DeFillippo actually say?
I do not think that that has ever been clarified
because the police officer perceived at first, Mr. DeFillippo
to say, "I am Sergeant Mash."

The police officer admitted

subsequently that Mr. DeFillippo may well have said to him,
"I work for Sergeant Mash" or "I know Sergeant Mash."
There are actually three explanations for these
..

1 two questions.
QUESTIONS

Were any of these accurate?

MR. HQWARTK:

Yes, Your Honor.

As a matter of fact,

although the question was not explored fully at the preliminary
exam stage, Officer Bednark was asked whether in fact there
was an Officer Mash.

There is an officer by that approximate

name working for the Detroit Police Department and if I could
b© allowed an informal offer of proof before this Court
QUESTIONs

No, you cannot offer proof before this

Court, Counsel.
!

MR. EGWARTH:

All right but the question having

been, was that in fact accurate? I want

to answer by res­

ponding although it is not in the record that there was

36

certain proof that Mr. DeFiHippo did in fact work for
Sergeant Mash.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Howarth, on page 12 of the Peti­

tion for certiorari, the first page of the opinion of
Michigan Court of Appeals which is the court that laid down
the rule that we are reviewing here? I take it, the court says,
"When asked for his — Defendant did not appear intoxicated
but when he

was asked for his identification he replied that
\

he was Sergeant Mash, a Detroit police officer.
"When asked for his badge number, Defendant replied
that he was working for Sergeant Mash."
Now, that is the hypothesis we have to work from
her®, is it not?
MR. HOWARTH:
QUESTIONS

Yes,,

Even though the Court of Appeals might

have found it differently had the case been argued differently
to it.
MR. HOWARTH:

I would agree with that.

The only

point that we make on that is that it is not 100 per cent
certain that Mr. DeFillippo did in fact continue to represent
to the officer that he was,*in fact, a fellow Detroit police
officer.
QUESTION s

Are you telling us we should not accept

what Mr. Justice Relinquish just read to you out of the opinion?
MR. HOWARTH:

No, I am not.

What I am ~

37
QUESTION:

We either accept it or we do not and if

we accept it, we cannot accept any of your hypotheses»
MR» HOWARTH:

What I would say merely is that the

Joint Appendix filed with the Court makes three references to
the answer given by Mr» DeFillippo.
One, 55 X am Sergeant Mash.'5
Two, "I work for Sergeant Mash."
Three, 551 know Sergeant Mash.”
And the only point that we make is that it is not
crystal clear exactly what response Mr. DeFiHippo was making
to the police officer and —
QUESTION:

Well, would you say that at the time

and in those circumstances, in an alley, after 10:00 o'clock
at night -- presumably after dark — that the police officer's
suspicions would be aroused by at least the ambiguity that you
are suggesting?
MR. HOWARTH:
suspicious.

The police officer could have been

I have no problem with the fact that the police

officer may have been suspicious and may have had his suspif

.cions aroused as ro who in fact is this man.
However, we do point out that we do not believe
that the record would Indicate the criminal activity portion
of the argument which Mr. Baughman makes.

Mr. DaFillippo was

not shown to even be in close proximity to the young lady.
Mr. DeFillippo was not shown to be doing anything

which had

38

a sexual overtone about it.
QUESTION?

Counsel, do you not agree that the Michi­

gan Court of Appeals proceeded on the basis — afc least on the
assumption that there was reasonable suspicion for a stop and
also proceeded on the assumption that there was probable cause
to arrest under the ordinance and then struck down the or­
dinance.
MR. HOWARTH;
QUESTION:

They may have, although they —

Just why should we independently make

some factual determination that has never been made in the
state courts?

Never been passed on?

MR. HOWARTH:

The difficulty that 1 have had with

this particular proposition — and as has been pointed out in
the brief, in the State of Michigan, probable,cause is not
sufficient to arrest for an ordinance violation.

An officer

must have actual proof of the existence of an ordinance viola­
tion.

This was not a felony.
QUESTION s

do not
That may be so but the — I/suppose the

Michigan Appellate Court would just unnecessarily abreaeh the
constitutional question.

They went right on by

these pre­

liminary questions, did they not?
MR. HOWARTH:

Certainly

the Michigan Court

Appeals went directly to the constitutionality of the ordinance
and it has not yet this morning been discussed, the problem
of the particular vagueness of the ordinance in question,

39

which is what 1 would like to turn to.
The Michigan Court of Appeals, while they did find
that the statute was perhaps overbroad and then used the ter­
minology that the statute, ordinance made criminal ttfhat was
otherwise innocent conduct I do not believe — and I would
agree with Mr. Baughman that that in and of itself would not
be a sufficient reason to strike down the ordinance.
However, we would submit that

when a statute takes

very presumptively innocent conduct such as a person walking
from Lis own home to go up to the corner to buy a newspaper,
that when a statute can make that conduct potentially illegal,
it must do so in terms which are clear, in terms in which the
ordinary man of average intelligence will have no difficulty
understanding and we submit that the Detroit Common Council
in August, 1976, in passing this particular ordinance, did not
set any such standards.
A standard in the ordinance itself uses the term
"identification" without any explanation of what will be
sufficient or what will be reasonable identification,
1 would submit that there are many citizens in the
City of Detroit who by their age or by their lack of a parti­
cular occupation are going to be unable to have, really, much
of any identification at all.
This ordinance, as a matter of fact, was passed
simultaneously with a curfew ordinance in the City of Detroit

40
and when one reads the Preamble to the ordinance, one sees that
this ordinance was aimed at the curbing of juvenile gangs in
Detroit.
There are going to be certainly many people who are
12 or 13 years old who could be on the streets of Detroit and
be unable to provide any identification whatsoever.

There

are going to be many people who will be substantially older
than that who will happen not to have their driver’s license
with them, who will happen not to carry a birth certificate
with them.
Those people, should they be unfortunate enough to
be standing innocently in the area of suspicious activity,
istand to be arrested by Detroit police officers.

The ordi-

nance also talks in terms of "unable to provide" and "refuse
to provide."

You may be detained-in either instance under

the Detroit ordinance.

Certainly you may be arrested if the

officer feels that you have refused to provide identification.
You may b© detained for merely being unable to.
Therefore, a person who himself is the victim of
a crime, who had his wallet taken, a person who is on a public
beach in a bathing area, these people will probably not refuse
to provide identification to police officers but clearly they
will be unable to provide identification to police officers.
QUESTION?
yourself, do you?

You do not need a document to identify

41
MR. HOWARTH:
ordinance.

That is unclear under the Detroit

The ordinance, when originally written and the

ordinance that we deal with today did not discuss whether the
identification need be written or oral.
However, there was evidence before the Detroit
Common Council on the day that the ordinance was passed,
showing that some of the proponents of that ordinance felt
that written identification would be required.
QUESTIONS

It is true that the ordinance makes

criminal only a refusal, not an inability.
MR. HOWARTHs

That is correct but it would allow

detention.
QUESTION;

There is a difference.

MR. HOWARTHs
QUESTIONS

That is correct.

If you come up to a person in a bathing

suit and ask him his name, he gives you his name and you ask
him for his driver's licens® and he says, "I am sorry, I do
not have my driver's license in my bathing suit.”

That is

not a refusal.
MR. HOWARTHs

No, but it would be an inability and

it could cause his detention.
QUESTION:

But an inability is not criminal, under

th® ordinance.
MR. HOWARTH:
QUESTION;

No, it would not be.

But in the predicate for all of this is

42

reasonable cause to believe that behavior of an individual
warrants further investigation and if you define that as a
ground for a Terry-type stop* you have certainly eliminated a
lot of people from the purview of the ordinance, have you not?
MR. HOWARTHs

You have, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

eliminated many people but certainly not all people because
anybody who is in the vicinity of criminal activity might be
considered to be in a suspicious circumstance, such as
Mr. DeFi11ippo.
We would concede that the young lady in question
was almost undoubtedly engaged in some type of illegal
activity.

I think the actual arrest was disorderly conduct

due to consumption of alcohol.
However, Mr. DeFiHippo could not have been an
aider and abettor in a situation of public intoxication.

QUESTION?

How many other people were nearby in

this dark alley?
MR. HOWARTHs

The record is unclear.

The record

merely states that the officers observed two people.
QUESTION?

Well, then, that means up here there

only two people on this record and the court has so

indicated, the Michigan courts have taken that for granted.
MR. HOWARTHs

The answer which I gave earlier

stating that many people could have been involved would not
necessarily apply to the particular situation in DeFillippo

43
but in many sittiafeions which could occur,
QUESTIONs

Well, we are only treating one situation

here now,
MR, HOWARTHs

I understand.

I merely am addressing

that to the difficulties with the application of this ordinance
generally, that it could be used

in many ways to cause whole™

sale arrests of people who were in the vicinity of what was
suspicious criminal activity, which is one of the potential
First Amendment problems with the ordinance,
QUESTION;

Well, of course, let me put it this way,

is the question in Detroit or Michigan, can people b® detained
as material witnesses?
MR, HOWARTH?

I am not familiar with any material

witness statute in the State of Michigan which would allow
detention of people on the street.
However, applying your question —
QUESTION?

Well, if police officers do not get the

witnesses then and there, very often the odds are they will
not get them at all..
MR. HOWARTH?

That is correct.

And certainly, if

this had bean a felony arrest as opposed to a misdemeanor
arrest, the officer would have the obligation to produce res
juste witnesses and Mr. DeFillippo could have been considered
a res juste witness to whatever
being arrested for.

crime the young lady was

But the young lady was arrested for a

44
misdemeanor and there is no res juste rule in the Stata of
Michigan which requires a police officer to ascertain the
names of all parties in the presence of a misdemeanor arrest.
QUESTION;

Mr. Howarth, part three of your brief,

you state and argue that the Detroit Common Council lacked
good faith in enacting this ordinance.
MR. HOWARTHs
QUESTION s

Yes.

Is there any evidence in this record

to support that rather serious charge?
MR. HOWARTHs
two sources.

The evidence in the record comes from

It comes generally from the way in which this

particular ordinance was passed, the particular emergency in
response to —
QUESTIONS

Is this in the record?

MR. HOWARTHs

That is not in the record and we

had hoped to include it in the brief before the Court under
the principle of a Brandeis brief in that it is documented
material that we have put into the statement of facts and we
had asked the Court to consider that.
However, what could be considered part of the
record is that we know what the ordinance stated and there
are decisions, there are two decisions of the Michigan Supreme
Court

that would indicate that the Detroit Common Council

was acting in an area which was prompted by state lav; to begin
with and we have presumed that the Michigan Common Council

45
was aware of the state of law

in the State of Michigan, that

they could not use ignorance of Michigan Supreme Court decisions;
principally the decision in Walsh versus the City of River
Rouge.
QUESTION;

Can you point to anything in any of the

opinions in the Michigan courts that indicate they thought
what you are presenting to us now in this Brandeis concept
was relevant to this case?
MR, HOWARTHs

No and the reason for that,

Mr» Justice
QUESTION:

Then why should we spend any time eonsi-

dering it here?
MR. HOWARTHs

Well, the issue was raised before

the Michigan Court of Appeals but not reached and we thought
that under the position of this Court in Smith versus Stingman
the fact that if facts as we allege

them are true, that per­

haps the matter should be remanded to the Michigan Court of
Appeals to reach that question.
It has been raised before the Michigan Court of
Appeals that there was a state preemption problem involved in
this case, that ordinance violations dealing with emergency
situations, on other words, riots or states of emergency, in
the cities in the State of Michigan is a matter which is par­
ticularly reserved to the state government and had been so
held since the early 19609s and it was raised for that reason.

46
QUESTIONs

Was it argued to the Michigan court that

the police officer also acted in bad faith ~ another charge
you make in your brief.
MR. HOWARTH:
QUESTIONs

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell, we did state -

Did the court — excuse me, go right

ahead.
MR. HOWARTH:

We did state that if one reads the

ordinance section which follows the particular ordinance here,
that section states that if an arrest is made under Section
52.3, that all the police officer can do is make a pat-down
for dangerous weapons.

So the officer was specifically ex­

cluded under the same law that he sought to enforce to make
a full-blown search for any

fruits of any crime and yet the

officer admitted that he was not making a pat-down merely for
weapons but that he was going beyond that and we would maintain
that the officer then was in a very similar position to the
officer in Sibron versus Mew_York in that he was not looking
for weapons as he was allowed to do under a stop and frisk
statute but was in fact looking for drugs and did in fact find
drugs and that is where we allege that if the good faith issue
is to b© considered, that there is a high potential of a lack
of good faith on the officials who put this particular situation into existence.
That would be both the Council and the officer
involved

47
This Court has bean asked to consider the case of
Alro.eida---Saneh.es and how it applies to the instant situation
and we maintain before this Court that the Alaieida-Sanchea
decision is actually dispositive of the case at bar, that
there is not an actual difference that can be found.
The Petitioner has alleged that the difference is
that Almeida-Sanchez was a statute which authorised searches
and that was as opposed to the ordinance in Detroit which does
not specifically authorise searches but actually defines cri­
minal conduct,
QUESTION;

Can I ask you a moment how you interpret

this statement of the Appellate Court?
poain it.

You can probably esc-

It says that the Detroit ordinance sanctions full

searches on suspicion without regard for dangerousness of
those persons whose activities fall within the vague para­
meters of the ordinance.
Now, does it read the ordinance the way you do or

I think they did not.

Under —

Even if the ordinance was valid, even

if the arrest was valid, the search was invalid because of
52.4.
MR. HOWARTH s
QUESTION;

That is correct.

But that is not what the Court of

Appeals held, is it?
MR. HOWARTH:

No and the reason, I believe for that

is that the Court of Appealt? was correctly holding that under
United States vers us Robin s on, once an arrest is made, even
for a traffic stop, even for an ordinance violation, this
Court has held that a full search may be made ~
QUESTION %

Oh, yes, but as far as the Fourth

Amendment was concerned but certainly it does not say that a
state may not restrict the power of its officers.
MR. HOWARTHs

That is correct.

And we believe that

under Section 52.4, the city officers actually were restricted
from doing anything other than making a Terry-type pat-down.
QUESTION?

Well, this — the substance for the

50-51
possession of which he was prosecuted was found in a package
of cigarettes after he was taken to the station house, was it
not?
MR. HOWARTH:
scene»

The tinfoil packet was found in the

The tinfoil packet was not searched to determine the

presence

of phenyclidene until he got to the station house.
QUESTIONS

But you think the — you think the

search that found the tinfoil went beyond the search that the
ordinance authorized?
MR. HOWARTHs
QUESTIONS

Yes.

For a valid arrest.

MR, HOWARTH:

That is correct.

Although it does

not go beyond what has been allowed under traditional Fourth
Amendment principles announced in the Robinson case.
This Court has, on many occasions, faced the situa­
tion of a claim or a presumed claim that an officer has acted
in good faith under an executive ~ under a legislative or
under a judicial ruling of the state from which the officer
comes.

To rule that good faith reliance upon executive action,

upon legislative action or upon judicial action within the
state renders that conduct higher than the Fourth Amendment
would require in our position the overruling of the AlmeidaSanchez case, would require the overruling of this Court's
decision in Berger versus New York on which the wiretapping
warrant was specifically allowed under state statute, even

52
though the standards set down by that statuta were too vague
to be allowed under Fourth amendment principles, would require
the overruling of the case of Coolidge versus New Hampshire,
the Attorney General warrants which were specifically allowed
by state statute, would require an overruling of at least the
reasoning which was presented in the case of Mincey versus
Arizona, the reliance — and I am certain it had to be good
faith reliance on a decision of the highest court in the state,
allowing an exception to the Fourth Amendment murder scene»
QUESTION:

But there is a difference»

Let us —

you are citing a good many cases, a good many familiar names
because I wrote some of those»
And would there not be a difference ~ let us say
a state legislature should say, no warrant will ever be re­
quired in this state for the arrest or search of anybody.
Well, that would clearly be contrary to the Fourth Amendment
and be an invalid statute,
MR. HOWARTH:
QUESTION:

That is correct,

But here ~ and therefore, an arrest

without a warrant would still be — regardless of that statute
would still be unconstitutional unless it was under one of
the exceptions of the Fourth Amendment but here the question
is, if you have a criminal ordinance on the books that has
never been held by anybody to be an invalid ordinance and a
policeman arrests somebody for violation of that ordinance, is

53
that a wrongful arrest?

That Is quite a different question, is

it not?
MR, HOWARTH:

I perceive them as being more similar.

The question is certainly one of degree as opposed to one of
time.

This Court has stated that if a state legislature or a

town council were to pass an ordinance saying that police
officers could arrest all suspicious persons, that that would
not pass constitutional muster.
Certainly there will be different gradations of
that problem, certain degrees but I think that the case at
bar is merely a case of degree.
You have a statute or an ordinance very much like
the loitering statutes and you have one that has no standards
that a police officer can even rely on in good faith.

If the

police officer cannot point to some standard on which he re­
lied, the question of his good faith becomes very difficult
to ascertain.
If you cannot ascertain whether he truly had good
faith or not, you might be in a position of saying that since
all state statute^" and all ordinances are presumptively valid,
police officers can make arrests and make full-blown searches
on any ordinance that is passed until such time as that or­
dinance can be declared unconstitutional.
QUESTIONS

Well, let us take one that is very

specific, a speed limit of 55 miles adopted by a state not a

54
state? not a federal and a car is
hour.

arrested going 75 miles an

Is there a question of good faith there?
MR. HOWARTHs
QUESTION:

There should not be.

The police officer is under a mandate to

arrest people going over 55 miles an hour? is he not?
MR. HOWARTH:
QUESTION

%

I agree.

Now? suppose that a search of th© car

disclosed that the car was loaded with heroin.

Later? if that

is determined by this Court? the 55 mile an hour statute is
unconstitutional as an undue burden on interstate commerce?
let us assume? does that mean they suppress the heroin in that
case?
MR. HOWARTH?

1 would think not and the difference

being that we would foe talking about a statute which I per­
ceive to have been something this Court has discussed as a
technical violation of the Constitution as opposed to what this
Court talked about in Sibron versus New York? being those
statutes which themselves trench on Fourth Amendment rights.
The hypothetical case which you have presented
would certainly not trench on any Fourth Amendment right
directly in th© statute.

We submit that the Detroit ordinance

did so by setting up a vague? setting up an ambiguous statute,
setting up ©n@ that did not have standards and which allowed
polica officers at mere whim and caprice to make arrests.
Under a speeding statute? of course a police officer

55
would have to be able to point to the fact of why, specifically,
the person was going over the spaed limit, how ha determined
that and I think that he would have excellent standards on
which he could base that determination,.
QUESTION:

Well, vagueness and overbreadth do not

have anything to do with the Fourth Amendment»
MR, HOWARTH:
QUESTIONS

Vagueness and overbreadth can,

They

MR. HOWARTHs

have to do with Due Process.

They are Due Process arguments.

The

standard, however, is since a warrantless arrest depends on
the validity of the arrest to determine probable cause, when
the arrest cannot ever be found to be valid because there are
no standards, then you have a warrantless arrest which is in
itself unreasonable.
QUESTIONS

Well, all you are suggesting is that any

statute that happened to pick up the standard that Terry
announced would be vague, unconstitutionally vague.
MR. HOWARTHs

The standard would not deal with the

Terry standard as much as it would deal with the identification
standard which is the real problem.
QUESTIONS

You are not defending the other part,

then, of the Michigan Court of Appeals' opinion on vagueness?
MR. HOWARTHs

The vagueness dealing with the fact

that the —
QUESTION?

Standard.

No standard.

56
MR. HOWARTH:

The standard dealing with whether the

citizen will know when he must provide identification?
do agree with the Michigan Court of Appeals on that.

No* 1
It must

be —
QUESTION?

Well* that just means that the Terry

standard is unconstitutional* then.
MR. HOWARTH:

I do not know that the Terry standard

gave no recognition to the fact that a citizen must answer
questions and I ~ we have no objection with the right of the
police officer to ask questions of the citizen.

It is the

question of whether the citizen must be compelled to answer
those questions.
QUESTION:

I might also say that your 52.4 just

says* it seems to me* that if you make the kind of a stop the
52.3 contemplates* you may pat him down if you have reasonable
cause to believe that he is dangerous.

It does not say that

if he refuses to identify and then you arrest him that you
cannot make a full search.
MR. HOWARTH:

Well* we had interpreted it as being

the* really* the arrest provision,
QUESTION:

Well* apparently you do interpret it that

way but that certainly is not the way the Court of Appeals
interpreted it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* gentlemen*

the case is submitted.
[Whereupon* at 11:12 o'clock a.m. the case was
submitted.3
