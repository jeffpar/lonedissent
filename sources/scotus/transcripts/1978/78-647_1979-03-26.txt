PROCEEDINGS
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 6^7, Marehlor© v, Chaney.
Mr® Goldmark, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. GOLDMARK, ESQe,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GOLDMARK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
A Washington statute, Revised Code of Washington
29.^2.020, regulated the state committees from Washington's
major political parties.

One requirement of this statute is

that these state committees b© composed of two persons from
each county in th© state, no more, no less, and non® other.
The issue presentee! here is whether this require­
ment that the state committees be composed of two persons per
county, no more, no less, and non® other, can be constitution­
ally applied to bar the Democratic Party of Washington from
establishing its state committee composed of two persons from
each county plus one person from each legislative district
in the state.
QUESTION;

Ms*. Goldmark, as I understand it, in the

Supreme Court of Washington, you also challenged the require­
ment that the composition of the committees be on® man and
on® woman.

You don't renew that here?

i»

MR, GOLDMARK:

Mr, Justice Rehnqulst, that is correct,

we do not challenge that requirement here,
QUESTION:

And the last amendments didn*t change

that sex provision?
MR. GOLDMARK:
they did not.

Mr. Justice Blaekmun, to my knowledge

The appellants challenge here only the two

person per county requirement and the court below ruled that
this provision was severable from the remainder of the statute.
The appellants are eight members and officers of the
Washington Democratic Party,

Four of them were persons

elected as legislative district representatives to the
Democratic State Committee and denied their seats on the basis
of the challenged statute.

The appellees are the Democratic

State Committee and its Chairman at the time this suit wag
instituted.
The State of Washington was served, as required by
state law, with a copy of the complaint when this litigation
began and notified of the appeal to the Washington Supreme
Court,

It has not appeared at any stage in this proceeding.
The Democratic State Committee is the governing body

of the Washington Democratic Party,

In 1970, the Washington

Supreme Court in the ease of ling County Republican Central
j

Committee v. Republican State Committee, interpreted the
authority of state committees regulated by FiCW 29*42.020.
The court ruled there that these party state committees have

5
the Inherent power to govern the statewide operations of
parties as political organisations,,
QUESTION:

Between conventions®

MR. GOLDMARK:

Between*, subject only to the over­

riding authority of the party state convention.

That is

correct,, Mr, Justice Rehnquista they only govern between con­
ventions.
QUESTION:

And they are defined and provided for by

legislation enacted by the legislature of your state3 aren't
they?
MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice Stewart„ that is correct.

How long has that been true?

MR. GOLDMARK:

I am not aware, Your Honor.

The

statute authorises the party state committees to call conven­
tions and to plan them®

It specifically precludes them from

setting rules to govern the operations of the conventions®
QUESTION:

They are creatues of statute, aren't

theys the stats committees?
MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:
questions.

They are —

I will tell you why I am asking these

This is for me a pussling case and I am sure you

are going to ba helpful in straightening me out®

If a state

committee is a creature of statute and if it performs some
sort of statutory function in the State of Washington, it is
one thing.

If it is a private organization,, it is another.

6
In other words, I suppose the Federal Trade Commission, to
take the national government, which is a creature of statute,
couldn’t all of a sudden have a meeting and say we are going
to expand our membership to fifteen and then have argument
with the government of the United States saying that their
rights of association have been impaired because the statute
provided for a lesser number«
On the other hand, I suppose it is equally clear
that a garden club could have a legitiraate constitutional
claim if a legislature, federal or state, said or purported
to direct what its membership should be®

These committees ar©

creatues of statute, aren’t they?
MR® GOLDMARK:

Mr. Justice Stewart, it is not clear

that —
QUESTION:

They are not voluntary, self «-selecting

organisations.
MR. GOLDMARK;

The Democratic Party has been

characterised in the King County Republican Committee case
as a voluntary political association.

That association has

the right to establish a governing body.

Whether the statute

that regulates what that governing body does actually creates
It, regulates it or as I believe the court also said in that
case, gives it statutory body in being, may only be matters
of terminology because it seems clear that this is a voluntary
association and this regulation regulates the way in which it

?
can do certain functions.
QUESTION:

Well* it creates it almost, doesn’t its

the statute?
MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:

The 1970 »-

It says what a state committee is and of

what it shall be composed and then it gives it certain statutory duties and in that respect it is not unlike any govern­
mental agency.
-'V

MR. GOLDMARK:

The statement of the Washington

Supreme Court interpreting this statute was that the party
state committee had inherent power, not statutory power, but
inherent power to govern the statewide operations of a party
as a political organisation, and that is a quote from the
court’s decision.
QUESTION:

In how many other states are the political

parties created and defined by stata statute?
MR, GOLDMARK:

Mr, Justice Stewart, it is not clear

to me whether they are created by the statute
QUESTION:

Or defined by state statute.

MR, GOLDMARK:

To''the appellants® knowledge, they
/

are regulated in approximately 32 states.

Twenty of those

merely reference the existence of a state committee and leave
the composition to the party®e choice.

Four of them establish

a minimum number but allow the remainder to fee added by the
party.

Fourteen mandate that the party state committee shall

8
be composed on the basis of one person, one vote.

Twelve,,

like Washington* set an absolute figure.
QUESTION:

Don*t almost all of them provide for

elections of county delegates or representatives and then
provide that the county delegates shall elect the state com­
mittee?
MR. GOLDMARKs
knovrledge.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist* not to my

In a number ©f Instances* congressional district

organizations, for example* are entitled to elect representa­
tives to the state committee or legislative district organiza­
tions , not all are county based but most have a constituency
of soma kind like a county.
QUESTION:

Mr. Goldmark —

QUESTION:

Th© state9s attorney general Is notice-»

ably absent from this litigation.

Has h© ©v©r been in it at

all tryint o defend the statute?
MRo GOLDMRKs

Mr. Justice Blaekmun, h® lias net.

The appellants served th© attorney general with a copy of
their complaint when th© suit began and notified him of the
appeal for th© Washington Suprom© Court.

H© has not appeared

in any state
QUESTION:

And also th® amended complaint.

MR. GOLDMARK?
QUESTION:
sentence.

His what?

That is corrects Mre Justice Marshall®

Mr® Goldmark8 I &idm*t hear your last

9
MR® GOLDMARK:

He was also served with a copy of

appellants* amended complaint and notice of the appeal from
the trial court to the Washington Supreme Court.
QUESTION;

Then he has never —

MR. GOLDMARK;
QUESTION;

He has never appeared.

— been in the litigation at any stage?

MR. GOLDMARK;
QUESTION;

That Is correct®

What I wanted to ask, aside from that8

are there any other marker that we can find that shows the
interest that the state has in this statute?
.

MR® GOLDMARK;

Mr. Justice Marshall®
QUESTION;

The appellants are not aware of any,
I would like to -«

Did you serve him pursuant to some state

requirement that he must be served if a state statute of
constitutional ~«»
MR. GOLDMARK;

Mr. Justice Brennan, yes, I did®

The

Washington declaratory judgment statute requires the attorney
general to be served in any suit challenging the constitution­
ality of a state statute®
QUESTION;

But leaves It to Mm whether or not he

shall defend it?
MR® GOLDMARK;

That is correct, Your Honor.

I would like to add in further response to the ques­
tion of Mr, Justice Stewart that even if the statute is the
sole power that gives this committee being, It is clear that

10
the functions the statute requires that committee to perform
are protected by freedom of association

The statute author­

izes and requires that committee to call and plan state party
conventions.

That Is an activity protected by freedom of

association.
QUESTION:

Well., that is almost the question In this

case.
MR. GOLDMARK:

The statute requires the Democratic

State Committee to provide for election of delegates to the
Democratic National Party Convention.

As this Court knows

from the case of Cousins v. Wigoda9 the power within a party
to provide for the election of delegates t© national conven­
tions is considered to be extraordinarily political and a
vital matter within that party.
QUESTION:

Nows this statute which is quoted in your

brief refers to the state eomraitt©© ©f each major political
party.

I suppose @ls©i?h©re in the legislation major political

party is daflned one way or the other.
MR. GOLDMARK:

That is corrects Mr. Justice Stewart.

A major political party is one that received

5

percent or more

of the total vote cast in any preceding statewide ©lection,
QUESTION:

Generally there are two in your state —

MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

—- that would meet that definition?

MR. GOLDMARK:

The major benefit of being a major

11
political party is that you are allowed to participate in state
primaries* minor political parties must hold state conventions
in order to place their candidates on the general election
ballot.
QUESTIONs

How were these parties structured before

this statute was passed?

MR. GOLDMARK;

The record does net show* Mr„ Chief

Justice.
QUESTIONS

It is not a matter ©f which w® could take

Judicial notice if w© knew about it?

MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTIONS

Mr. Chief Justice —

Generally* was it purely a voluntary

organisation like a parent-teachers association or a garden
glub* as Justice Stewart suggested* just a voluntary group
that organised itself?
MR. GOLDMARK;

That would be my assumption.

This

statute* the state of Washington has had statutes regulating
the composition of party state committees since 1907®

If the

Democratic Party in Washington is like other political parties
In American history, it was a voluntary political association
up until about the 1890's when the Court will recall there
were abuses enough in primary election systems and other areas
to cause states to gradually bring political parties within
their regulatory power.
QUESTION;

Well, it :Ls almost a definition, first of

12
all, Isn’t ife, the state committee of each political party
shall consist of.
MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice —

And there is nothing in there that says

that some other Democratic political voluntary organization
isn’t entirely free to form itself and have whatever rules it
wants to8 but the legislature has defined what a state com­
mittee of each major political party is.
MR. 30LDMAM:
‘

Mr. Justice Stewart, perhaps I could

explain further the ruling of the court in this case with
respect to the charter enacted by the Democratic Party tfhioh
may further shed light on your concern®
That charter was adopted by the Democratic State
Convention in 1976c
joint appendix.

The charter is contained in the party*s

It is to establish the Democratic Party’s

permanent statewide organization.

Article 4.G. of that

charter states that the Democratic State Committee shall be
the governing . body of the party while the convention is in
adjournment.

In the decision below, the Washington Supreme

Court held that the Democratic State Convention has the
supreme party authority, is implicitly empowered, it did not
say empowered by statute but implicitly empowered to establish
the party’s permanent statewide political organization and
to delegate authority within that organization.
QUESTION:

fou say th© Democratic State Party?

That

IB
Is what you just said»
MR. GOLDMARK:

The Democratic State Convention meet­

ing in 1976 adopted the charter»

Excuse me, Mr® Justice

Rehnquist, the Washington Supreme Court further held that the
Washington Democratic State Convention was Implicitly em­
powered to establish the party9s permanent statewide organi­
sation and to delegate authority within that organisation.
QUESTION:

And that is a relatively voluntary

organisation, I take It?
MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:

That Is correct, four Honor»

What is an example »<=» supposing the

Democratic State Central Committee were on the outs with the
Democratic State Party as represented by the state convention,
what sort of serious burdens could the Democratic State Com­
mittee put on the Democratic State Convention or Party?
MR. GOLDMARK:

For example, Your Honor, If the

Democratic State Convention adopted a party platform which
the state committee then refused to implement, that would be
a very substantial burden on the party’s freedom of associa­
tion.
QUESTION:

Well, how would a Democratic State Com­

mittee composed such as this is by statute play a rol© in
Implementing the platform ©f the state party?
MR® GOLDMARK:

Because that is its inherent function®

It is, as you will notice, clause 5 of this statute authorises

the state committee to perform ail inherent functions of such
organisation.

And the court in the decision below held that

the Democratic Party State Convention is implicitly wmpeered
to establish its permanent statewide party organisation and
delegate authority within it* and that was the statutory state
committee.

But the court below held that the Democratic Party

charter is binding authority on the Democratic State Committee
absent valid state law to the contrary®
QUESTION:

But nothing that the state central com­

mittee could do would prevent the members of the Democratic
State Party or the people who adhered to the platform adopted
at the convention from espousing their views as to how good a
platform it was*
MR. GOLDMARK:

A political party is an organisation

established to influence policy and to win elections.

The

only permanent statewide organisation that members of the
Democratic Party have* the only organisation carry this out
between conventions is the Democratic State Committee.

If

this committee does not implement th© party’s platform* raise
money* as th© record shows it does* it raises money for
Democratic candidates and distributes money to those candi­
dates, if the committee does not perform these functions as
the convention desires* that will be a very substantial
burden on —
QUESTION:

Well* can’t the party itself raise money

15
quit© apart from the activities of the state central committee?
MR. GOLDMARK:

The state central committee is under

the common law of the state under this statute and under the
party’s charter its governing body.

If the Democratic Party

attempted to establish some other organisation, the appellants
have no doubt that it would be denounced as an Illegal body.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that the Supreme Court of

Washington would tell you if the Democratic Party had a fund
raising event in Seattle or Spokane and Takoma that wasn’t
sanctioned by the state central committee, that you couldn’t
have that event?
MR. GOLDMARK:
suggesting that.

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I am not

I am suggesting that this is the party’s

permanent statewide organisation.

It has the authority,when

the Democratic State Committee speaks on an issue, it speaks
with the authority of the Democratic Party.

It elects the

party’s chairman, it elects the state chairman.

When he

speaks, h® speaks with the authority of the Democratic Party,
For the convention to establish some other body would not
only ba contrary to state law, it would tee extraordinarily
devisive with the party.
party.

This Is the group that leads this

Party members have no other organisation to look to

for this function.
The record is clear that this state committee
raises and distributes money to party candidates, passes

16
resolutions and performs all the normal functions of the
governing body of a political party.

Four of the appellants

were .'elected as members to serve and participate in its
r

decisions and have been denied from doing so on the basis of
this statutory requirement and there is no evidence anywhere
in the record of any compelling state interest of the State of
Washington that justifies the such a burden.
QUESTION:

The legislature has defined what the

state committee is and what it shall consist of.

Mow, it is

not at all unusual for a legislature, state or federal, to
set up advisory committees.

There was a committee almost a

generation ago set up by the federal government, I don’t know
if it was by legislation or resolution or what, an antitrust

study group, ©f which my Brother Stevens was a member, and 1
am sure that whatever it was, whether it was legislation or
a resolution or an executive order, whatever it wass set up

'Now, could that organ­

isation have had a meeting and said we want to double our

membership and have a member from every state, once the
government, legislative or executive, had set it up and de­
fined it?

There ie no indication that this: one did,

There is no indication that this one did, either.

What we have before us Is a legislative act defining what a
state committee is.
MR. GOLDMARK:

Your Honor, the appellants believe,

as the Washington Supreme Court has said and with the Courtfs
indulgence I will read it, the statement that appears on page
five of appellees' brief in which the Washington Supreme Court
stated the powers of the state committees and stated their
role under the statute:

"Representative of a perraanent state

party organization, though subordinate to the overriding power
of the party's state convention" — so the two are linked, the

and regulations for its own internal government, as well as to

convention, intraparty rules governing statewide operations

For this reason, appellante submit that state law
regulates the activities of the Democratic State Committee.

Mr. Goldmark, doesn’t everything you have

MR. GOLDMARK:

Yes, Mr. Justice —

And can’t the convention do anything it

MR. GOLDMARK:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, and it

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stevens.

QUESTION:

No, no, forgetting the membership, talk

shall comprise the membership of the state central committee,
wouldn’t the convention’s views prevail?
MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:

No, Mr. Justice Stevens.

In what example would they not prevail?

19
MR. GOLDMARK:

To give you an example of something

that occurred during the pendency of this case — and I refer
to a matter outside the record, something contained in the
minutes of the Democratic State Committee meeting, and I
believe the Court may take judicial notice of this under the
case of Texas Railway v. Potter, 291 U.S., simply for the
fact the state committee took such an action0

The Democratic

State Party platform for a number of years has espoused repeal
of state sales taxes on food and drugs.

At a meeting prior

to a general election to vote on an initiative which would
have accomplished this repeal, the state committee adopted
a resolution opposing it.

Now, what remedy does the state

convention have to bring the state committee into line?
QUESTION:

It doesn’t have to.

It just says the

policy ©f the party shall be to favor it, instead of opposing
it and that controls under the statute.
MR. GOLDMARK:
years.

The state convention meets every two

It has no power during the interim except through

the party’s representatives on the state committee to see
that its mandates are carried out.

In litigation, if the

party cannot control the composition of its state committee
so that the state committee is responsive to the party, it
has no means except litigation which courts properly are
reluctant to bring.
QUESTION:

The situation is now that what a state

20
committee is is defined by statute.

Now* your remedy is to go

to the legislature of the State of Washington and have them
either repeal that statute or amend It, but the whole defini­
tion of what is a state committee is contained in a statute
of your state.
QUESTION:

But he says he can come here and get us

to amend ite
MR. GOLDMARK:

Common law of the State of Washington

gives the Democratic Party the authority to assign functions
to its state committees the same state committee regulated by
the statute and to delegate authority to its
QUESTION:

It is not just regulated* it Is created*

it is defined by the statute* insofar as one can see* created
by the statutea
MR. GOLDMARK:

Mr* Justice Stewart, I must respect»

fully disagree with your choice of terminology.

Given the

decisions of the Washington Supreme Court in the King County
Republican case and in the decision of the court below* it
seems odd that the Democratic State Convention can ask its
state committee to do anything as the court below ruled except
establish the composition of the party’s state committee.
QUESTION:

What if the Democratic State Convention,

Mr» Goldmark, had said that the Democratic State Central
Committee shall not be subject to any elections at all but
simply to© appointed by the Democratic State Convention every

21
two years and the Washington State legislature passed a statute
saying, no, you are going to have some elections»

Would you

feel you had as strong a ease?
MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:

Well —

In other words, the Democratic State

Party was asserting its authority over the central committee
by saying that instead of having the central committee having
its members elected, they were going to be appointed by the
state convention*
MR* GOLDMARK:

It seems to me If the convention as

a large body who is going to appoint these people. It would
have to elect them.
QUESTION:

But suppose it said then that the chair­

man of the convention would appoint them?
MR. GOLDMARK:
would be proper,

It is not clear to me whether that

I do know in California, for example, vir­

tually every member of the party*s state committee is
appointed by the party officers, for example*

The- governor

appoints two members, the secretary of state appoints two
members*

This seems to be a common practice in a number of

states*
QUESTION:

What if the convention decided that the

central committee should b© composed of two members from
each county but the legislature then said, oh, no, the central
committe© should be selected on a population basis?

22

MR. GOLDMARK:

Mr. Justice White, I have thought

about that question and It is not clear to me whether the state
would have a compelling state interest in forcing a state com­
mittee to be apportioned on the basis of one person, one vote*
In this ease, the two person per county requirement of this
statute has already been superceded by federal oourt injunc­
tion requiring the state committee to vote on the basis of one
person, one vote whenever it exercises those electoral functions, the federal court ruling that the Fourteenth Amendment
required it to do so when it performed these electoral
activities.
QUESTION:

What is the status of that litigation?

MR. GOLDMARK:

That was a stipulated injunction be­

tween the Democratic State Committee and the parties in that
case.

The state committee only exercises these electoral

functions on —
QUESTION:

It seems like most party political

troubles that we have in most states9 that they settle within
the convention politically and In Washington they settle them
in courts
MR. GOLDMARK:

There is no way for the party to

settle this in the court, Mr. Justice Marshall, because it
can8t control its own state coiamittee.

What the convention

decides can only be settled by litigation because it has a
state committee whose composition it cannot control*

That is

23
the substantial burden on freedom of association.
QUESTION;

So that is the difference from other

states where you vote it down, In other words, politically?
MR. GOLDMARK;
QUESTION;

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall.

So we will be supervising the parties

eventually?
MR. GOLDMARK;

Mr. Justice Marshall, it is the

appellants’ belief that the parties are free to decide how
their governing bodies are composed and assert power over them
through the political process of —
QUESTION:

And you go to the legislature and change

the act.
MR» GOLDMARK:

The fact that the legislature can re-

move a burden on freedom of association and provide that
remedy does not excuse the substantial burden it is creating
in —
QUESTION:

Well, \*asn't that act passed by a po­

litical party or do you have nonpartisan elections?
MR, GOLDMARK:
by political parties»

The state legislature is controlled
It is a fact of political life that

often legislatures and politicians in office are not exactly
excited about having strong, over responsive party organisa­
tions and prefer to see one built around individuals»
QUESTION:

Mr, Goldmark, could the state statute

say that the party’s central committee shall be composed of

24
the following ten people and then list an accountant, a
lawyer, an engineer, and just list ten people?

It doesn’t

say they have to be from anywhere, it just says that is going
to be the governing body of the party.

Would that be uncon­

stitutional, too?
MR. GOLDMARK:

Mr. Justice White, only if the party

decided that It wished a governing body of some different —
QUESTION:

Well, it does, it does, it decides that

it wants —
MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:

Two persons per county.

— it wants two lawyers and it goes right

down the list and says they want two of everybody.
MR. GOLDMARK:

The party’s preference should con­

trol .
QUESTION:

Well, why is that?

MR. GOLDMARK:

Because It Is a voluntary political

association that has a right to decide for Itself how Its
governing body shall be composed.

The composition of the

party’s governing body can be as important to the success of
that party as the choices it makes In the platform,
QUESTION:

Do you fch3,nk the state can Impose a duty

on the party that the party doesn’t want to perform?
MR. GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:

I don’t know, Mr. Justice White.

Do you suppose it can prevent the party

from doing something that the party v^ants to do?

25
MR® GOLDMARK:

If the party wishes to take a posi­

tion on a particular issue, It certainly can do that»

If it

Is there some law In Washington or under

the Constitution that would prevent — if you don’t like the
rules about the Democratic Party or the Republican Party in
Washington, there is no reason you can’t form another one,

This is not a realistic alternative

for members of the Democratic Party because —

MR. GOLDMARK:

We are not, Mr* Justice White, taking

advantages of provisions for getting candidates on the ballot.

activities, are themselves calling and planning state conven­

If I understand your position

correctly, If you just reversed the positions In this case

you would say that the statute would be equally unconsti­

MRe GOLDMARK:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens.

And is It your position then that no

subject to this attack under the First Amendment?
MR» GOLDMARK:

No, Mr. Justice Stevens»

Mr. Brink.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL P. BRINK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. BRINK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I think to understand the question, we do have to go
back Into the background of the system, th® political structure
of the State of Washington and the governmental structure.

It

has be®n a -«» we are still a fairly young state, but of some
seventy years duration has there been this structure of 39
counties, with 39 separate governments, each having their own
elected representatives — excuse me, legislative, executive
and Judicial branches, they elect their own county judges,
the county commissioners and executives, prosecuting attorneys,
county clerks and so on down the line.
The state has authorised by a section, just one
following this, and in the same basic enabling act in 190? the
existence of county committees which are composed of precinct
committeemen elected in each county.

These organisations, of

course, parallel the county governments.

Then the county

committee of each county selects two members to the state
committee.

Originally it was just one in 1907.

In 1927, as

I recall, they added the rights of one man and one woman from
each county.
QUESTION:

Now, when you say "they added," that is

28
the state legislature?
MR. BRINK:

The state legislature, yes, Your Honor.

The powers of the county committee are not restricted by
statute.

And when it is stated here that there can be no

other organisation speaking for the Democratic Party, that is
simply not true.

Each county speaks for Itself and sometimes

most vociferously, and they are not always in concert.
However, the state charter attempted to put the
counties In line a little bit and did say that they do have a
limitation upon them and that is that they should attempt at
least to follow the policy set forth in the national platform
the state platform and the county platform.
The state committee, as I said, is elected by the
— composed of these people from the county committees, two
from each, and just provides a skeleton of the state party
and is an administrative, not an electoral and not a policy­
making body.
convention.

The policy-making Is reserved to the state
The charter itself requires the state committee

to follow the policies set forth by the state convention and
by the state charter.
It Is Important to understand that the functions of
the state committee are relatively limited.

I would like to

talk to you about what it does and what it does not do.

By statute, it comes into being every —

It

QUESTION:

May I ask, is its powers limited to the

five specified in the statute?

MR. BRINK:
those»

Its powers by statute are limited to

However, it ha3 been assigned additional functions by

the state convention.

In further answer to that, Your Honor,

the state convention can, of course, assign additional com­
mittees to do additional things.

The state convention is all

powerful In the view of the Washington State Supreme Court,
in any event.
QUESTION:

What do you think, Mr. Brink, is the

federal Issue involved in this case?
MR. BRINK:

I do not believe there to be a federal

issue because I do not believe there to be an infringement
at all upon anybody's rights to associate.

The state com­

mittee does not nominate candidates, it does not even endorse
candidates, it does not participate in the election process.
It is simply an administrative function to try to glue these

39 counties together to provide communication, one to the
other.
It is our position, as the appellees, that there
is no Issue under the First Amendment»
QUESTION:

Well, do you make your case, if you

demonstrate to us that there io no federal issue involved in
the case, that it is a matter for the state legislature, the
people of Washington?

30
MR. BRINK:

Mr® Chief Justice, that is of course our

position.
QUESTION:

Well, why not focus sharply on that?

MR. BRINK:

I will attempt to®

The state legisla­

ture has been requested in the past on several occasions in
the last ten years to change this composition makeup of the
state committee.

The legislature, which is made up by one

man, one vote basis, has declined to do so.

In fact. It

hasn't even considered it strongly enough to pass from one
house to, the other.
I don't know how I can answer your question further.
QUESTION:

Well, Is there anything In the Washington

law that would prevent the convention from forming a committee,
call it whatever you wanted to, to perform all the functions
that the convention wanted It to perform except the ones, that
the statute says the central committee has to perform?
MR® BRINK:

I agree, Your Honor, I think that is

correct that they can do so, that they could form a committee
for fund raising, they could form a committee —
QUESTION:

So that insofar as

so that you think

the issue really Is here whether or not it is constitutional
for the state to say that the committee, that the central
committee that is to perform these five functions has to be
two from each county?
MR. BRINK:

Yen think that Is the issue?
If the legislature said It should be

31
two from each county and
QUESTION:
MR. BRINK:

To perform these particular functions.
— just these limited functions, that

does not Impinge upon anybody's rights of association or
expression.
QUESTION:

I understand you say that is really the

only Issue that is here.
MR. BRINK:
QUESTION:

That is to us the only issue here.
Because the party could provide for —

under the statute, the party could have all the other func­
tions that the state committee might be given to perform that
could be assigned to another committee.
MR. BRINK:

It can.

In fact, they have set up a

judicial committee by the charter.
separate finance committee.
QUESTION:

They did not set up a

That has —

This category five, perform all functions

inherent In such an organization, how broad is that?
MR. BRINK:

That is not very broad In view of the

King County Republican case in which the Washington State
Supreme Court said that subject to the overriding power of
the state convention.

So I suspect the legislature, when it

said Inherent was saying, vrell, do whatever you can.
QUESTION:

Even the exercise of one, two, three and

four under the case you mentioned, were subject to the over­
riding authority of the convention?

32
MR. BRINK:

Absolutely, that Is the holding of the

Washington State Supreme Court back in 1971 in King County
Republican case.
This Court has not so far as we can tell gone so far
as to ■—
QUESTION:

So you say that under the Washington law,

while there must be a central committee with two members from
each county, the convention could remove — could say that the
committee has no functions?
MR0 BRINK:

They could theoretically do that, in our

view0
QUESTION:

And we will set up another committee to

do all the things we want them to do and we will have this
committee composed any way we want it to be?
MR. BRINK:

Right, but they must allow the state

central committee as set up by statute to exist to attempt to
l

\

coordinate at least the election procedures of the 39 differ­
ent counties and their own county committees, and it does
provide an element of stability between conventions.

It Is

there, it is official, the secretary of state knox^s he can
call up the state chairman of either party and plan ahead for
conventions.

This Is the most important function, it seems

to me, of the state committee, and that is to initiate the
election procedures by calling

conventions, setting dates,

having the precinct committeemen and their various precincts

33
set the dates for precinct caucuses, for county caucuses, and
then for the state convention.

But as also limited by

statute, they can't tell the state convention what to do in
its own convention.
The cases that this Court is cited to of Kusper v.
Pontlkes and Cousins v. WIgoda are just so far and away from
what we are Involved here.

Those were — Cousins v„ Wigoda

involved a national political party convention and as to
which delegation from the State of Illinois should be seated9
the one that was elected under the state law or the one that
was selected in accordance with rules of the national conven­
tion.

And the state did attempt to Interfere and this Court

said it was an interference, but that was a national conven­
tion case.
be, it is

The Court was very concerned and well it should
of Importance to all parties, all citizens that

this convention be held without interference from fifty
states«

It is also in the case of Kusper v. Pontikes, that

was a nomination case on a state level against the State of
Illinois and where an Illinois statute prevented the appellee
fr’om voting in the Democratic primary because she had within
23 months previously voted in a Republican primary„
Now, the Washington state committee does not affect
at all primary elections, it does not permit, prevent,
deprive anyone from participating in primary or general
elections»

The Rippon Society case is simply not in point

34
again, a national convention cases in which the Republican —
and also was a Fourteenth Amendment case.

There is no

Fourteenth Amendment issue here, nor is there one raised here»
Assuming that there would be any kind of a burden
upon the appellants, there is a state interest in maintaining
the stability and integrity and continuity of the major
political parties in the state»

You become a major political

party in Washington state by getting 10 percent of the vote at
the last general election, and then if the new party, new
major party is still in being, it can qualify for the primaryballot without a separate convention.

As a matter of fact,

I think the only time we had a party that achieved this -was
the Progressive Party back in 1948, and then, of course, by
the year 1950 nobody was interested to pick up the fact that
they were a major party, so we have a lot of minor parties
that come and go and a lot of them on the ballot.
QUESTION:

What party was that in '48?

MR» BRINK:

The Progressive Party, Your Honor»

They got enough vote to qualify for the next time but they
didn't follow through.
QUESTION:
MR» BRINK:

I see.
The state committee is not the policy­

maker but it is important that it retain communications or
maintain communications between these county organizations who
are all out speaking for themselves as well»

It' has the same

35
constituency as those county committees„

We suggest the

statute is narrowly drawn and serves a state interest to
maintain this continuity of the major parties.
It is our suggestion that the Court affirm the
Washington State Supreme Court„
Thank you.
MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Brink.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Goldmark?

You

have about three minutes.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A„ GOLDMARK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL
MR* GOLDMARK:
from Cousins v. Wigoda*

This case cannot be distinguished
There, this Court held that a party's

choice in the composition of its higher governing body was a
choice protected by freedom of association.

The matter there

was regulated by state law, yet the Court held that the state
of Illinois could not Interfere with the delegates chosen by
the party to attend the Democratic National Convention, or,
more Importantly, a state caucus held to elect members to the
Democratic National Committee»

And this Court said that the

membership in that state caucus was protected by freedom of
association because the representatives elected to the
Democratic National Committee would be involved in planning
the next Democratic National Convention»
QUESTION:

Well, didn't the Illinois court there

36
enjoin those representatives from presenting themselves as
delegates to the national convention?
MR. GOLDMARK:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and that

is the effect of this statute.

It has prevented four

appellants from presenting themselves to the state committee
and participating in its deliberations.
QUESTION:

So you must have to say that the state

central committee created by statute In Washington is of the
same political and associational significance as the
Democratic or Republican National Conventions sitting every
four years to choose a presidential candidate?
MR. GOLDMARK:
freedom of association®

It Is of the same significance for
The fact that a national party con­

vention was Involved in Cousins means that states may have
different interests in regulating.

A state may not have an

interest In regulating a national party convention for its
membership., whereas it may in repeating participation in
state party matters.

But both are protected.

The difference

in compelling interest does not relate back to strip away the
First Amendment protection of the association of party
members.

And Cousins did hold that state interference in a

state party caucus to choose representatives to the Democratic
National Committee was protected®
