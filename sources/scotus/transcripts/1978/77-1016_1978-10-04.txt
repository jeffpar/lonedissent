MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

We will hear arguments

in 77-1016, United California Bank and Lillian Disney Truyens
v. United States»
Mr. Gather, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD E. GOTHS R, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, GGTEBRs

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the courts
The facto of this case involve the Estate of Walt
Disney.

Under Mr, Disney's will he provided that 45 percent

of the residua of his Estate was to pass to the Disney Founda­
tion, where it was to fee held for certain charitable and
educational purposes, primarily for the support of California
Institute of the Arts, a school which he helped to found.
During 1967 and 1968, the Executors of hiss Estate
sold stock of Walt Disney Productions at a substantial gain.
In computing its tax for those years in which the gain was
incurred, the Estate excluded from tax 45 percent ©f the gain,
being the gain which was permanently set aside fox* and would
ultimately pass to charity, and paid tax, therefore, on only
55 percent of its gain.
Such 55 percent passed basically to taxable taxpayers,
a trust for the family of Walt Disney.
The IRS has taken the position that, if the Estate

4
wanted to exclude 45 percent of the gain which was passing to
charity, than in computing its tax on the 55 percent of the
gain passing taxable beneficiaries, it had to compute Such
gain — I should say it could not use in computing the tax on
such gain the alternative fax rate which during those years
placed a 25 percent limit on the amount of tax on capital gains»
What the Internal Revenue Service said was that if
you wanted to use the 25 percent tax rate, that tax rate must
be applied against 100 percent of the gain, including the 45
percent of the gain that passed to charity.
While the facts of the case are easy to understand,
unfortunately the law is not.

And this is due to some very

complex style of legislative drafting, and also to the inter­
relationship of several different Code sections.
I believe that the taxpayer has accurately interpreted
these Code sections and out together these Code sections in a
way that carries out the intent of Congress.

I would say that

the correctness of our interpretation must be judged against
the two basic intents of Congress, which are quite evident
from this particular fact pattern.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gother, in your primary brief you did

not cite Foster Lumbar.
MR. GOTHERs
QUESTION s
reply brief.

No, we did not.
YoU cited it rather collaterally in your

Do you feel that Foster Lumber has no significance

5

in this case at ail?
MR* GOTHER:
a couple of reasons.

I believe it has no significance for
The first is that it was dealing with

an entirely different set. of Code sections.

It was not dealing

with a charitable set aside deduction.
QUESTION;
MR. GOTHER*

That is conceded, of course.
It was not dealing with the taxation

of an Estate, which is 2 think a major factor here.

It was

dealing with a carry-back,of a lost carry-back to a prior year
during which the taxpayer calculated his tax using the alterna­
tive tax rate.
QUESTIONs

But is not the — we know all of that.

Is not the general principle saying, however, here is a statute
that seems to say one thing and conceded the intent of Congress
the other way.

And I just wondered whether your failure to

cite it is indicative of the fact that maybe it is against
you?
MR. GOTHERs
all.

I do not believe so, Your Honor, at

I think also that our interpretation of the Code is

a literal one and that we are literally interpreting our Code
section correctly and that the government is not.
QUESTION'S

What we gat down to then in your approach

is whether the Estate is a conduit period, nothing more?
MR. GOTHER:

In part and whether the conduit system

is applicable to the 1201(b)(2) alternative tax rate calculation,

6
yes.
Foster Lumber is .no different than the Weil case in
essence, that you had an excess of an ordinary deduction which
you ecu Id not use against your alternative tax rate*

And that

was a regular ordinary lost carry-forward deduction.
I am saying that our charitable set aside deduction
is an entirely different animal? that it Is not an ordinary
deduction that an individual taxpayer, individual or corporate,
such as in Foster Lumber had, but it is a different type of
deduction and it is more of a manifestation of this conduit.
Also in Foster Lumber the issue is the definition of
taxable income.

If there is anything that is relatively clear

in the Internal Revenue Code it

is the definition of taxable

income, and I do not believe that that is an issue here at
all.
We say that there are two basic intents of Congress
here that are evident.

One is that there is to be no tax

imposed on that part of any capital gain which an Estate realises?
or any income which an Estate realises,

be it ordinary income

or capital gain, which passes ultimately to a charity.

642(c)

in the Internal Revenue Code says that any gain, any item of
income, gain or ordinary income which is permanently sat aside
for charity is entitled to 100 porcent deduction, even though
it is not paid out.
So we have 100 percent deduction whether we pay it or

7
do not pay it out in the particular year»
as the set aside deduction»

It

It is referred to

is perfectly clear from that

that the intent of Congress was to exempt from tax that part
of income realised by a fiduciary»
The second intent of Congress, which is perfectly
evident, is that capital gains were to be taxed in those years
at a maximum of 25 percent.
Now you have got these two intents and I believe they
are perfectly reconcilable in our case, and our interpretation
carries both of-those out.

The government9s interpretation

does violence to one if not both of those.
Th© basic issue which separates ourself and'the
government is best explained in the question whether the capital
gains tax base for computing the alternative tax rate under
Section 1201(b)(2) includes the gain going to the charity.

This

is by far the biggest area of disagreement between ourselves
and -the government.

Section 1201(b) is set forth on pages
X.

8“A and 9-A of the Appendix to the government*3 brief.
Before getting into the specific language of those
sections, X think it is essential to take — stand back just
a bit and take a look at what is th© overall concept of the
taxation of estates and trusts.

We have a peculiar system of

taxation here because we have interposed a fiduciary, a third
party here.
a fiduciary.

We do not have a taxpayer and his tax.

We have

8

And the system — the basic system for taxation of
estates or trusts is first you determine what part of the income
that a fiduciary realises is either required to be distributed
or will be distributed or is distributed to a taxable benefi­
ciary*

And that is one set of income.

And you put that off

to a side.
The next is that you look to see if there is any
Income permanently set aside for charity.

Under 642, if it

is, you set that aside,
you are then left with a third group, a third body
of income that is taxed to the fiduciary.
is:

And then the question

What tax rate applies to that tax income?
Now you go to Section 1201f 1201(b) says that if

you have some capital gains in that year, you compute your tax
in a two-step approach.

You divide this taxable income that

I have over .here into its component parts, the first part being
ordinary income, the second part being capital gain.

And you

do that by taking the taxable income that you have hare and
deduct out the part that is capital gain.

And on the remaining

part you compute your tax at your ordinary income rate.

That

is your ordinary income.
The part that is capital gain you then tax at a
maximum of 25 percent.
Now what our position is that if you look at 1201
and apply it literally to what is the taxable income of the

3
Estate, our interpretation is as literal as any interpretation
can be of that Coda sectioni that the capital gains referred
to in that section, the long-term capital gains, is the long­
term capital gain that is in this pot taxable to the estate»
It is not in the pot that is going out to the taxable
beneficiariesi it is not the gain that is in the pot over here
for charity.
And. the best way I think I can —
QUESTION:

May I interrupt you, Mr. Gother?

Do you

take the position that the Weil case is wrong?
HR. GOTHER:
QUESTION:
MR. GOTHER:
QUESTION:

No.
You do not, do you?
Not in a fiduciary context.
Then you take the position that the word

"excess15 of long-term capital gain over net short-term capital
loss means one thing for a fiduciary and another thing for
an individual case?
MR. GOTHER:
QUESTION:

I believe that is correct.
And how do you reconcile that with the

fact that 1201(b) refers to any taxpayer.
MR. GOTHER:

Well, I think you are talking about the

taxable income of that taxpayer.
QUESTION:

If you look at 1201(b)(1) —

1201(b) starts out:

"If for any taxable

year the net long-term capital gain of any taxpayer" and then
it goes on.

And X would read it as prescribing the same

10
procedure for individual taxpayers as for fiduciaries.

I axa

just questioning your literal argument now.
MR. GOTBERs

Welly my literal argument says that

any taxpayer presupposes that you are talking about the taxable
income of that taxpayer„ not in the fiduciary context.

So that

in the fiduciary context that is literally being applied to this
other part of income that is over hare and not to these.
And 1 think another way of emphasising that is look
at 1201(b)(1) which now talks about the computation of the
partial tax.

The partial tax Is computed on taxable income.

Well again i, that has got to be the taxable income that is taxed
feo the taxpayer.

It cannot be some taxable income that is

sitting over — that is taxed to somebody else.
It seems to me we are applying it as literally.

Let

me show you that the government does not. apply that literally?
it does not even come close to applying it literally in the
context of gain which is set aside — a gain which is to be
distributed or is distributed to a taxable taxpayer.
Remember, I have got that gain sitting over here.
If you had gain that is to be distributed to a taxpayer, a
taxable taxpayer, it is sitting over in this other pile.

The

government does not contend that when you compute the 1201 tax
that this reference to the excess of capital gains — excess
long-term capital gain includes that taxable gain that goes
over to the taxpayer.

No, no.

That is already out.

11
QUESTION?

So they would take that out of the

fiduciary's pot -»»
ME. GOTHERs
QUESTIONs

They would.
— of capital gain?

MR. GOTHERs

And yet. if you want to read that as

literal as the government seems to read it literally, that
should not happen.

The tax should he —

QUESTION:

Well; at least you are saying that it

ought to be the same for both pots, for both the charity and
for the
MR. GOTHERs
QUESTION:

That is exactly my position, yes.
And the government says they can be

different?
MR. GOTHERs
QUESTION:

That is correct.
I take it that the government not only

does not object# but it actually concedes that the respect
of a taxable distributee this is the correct method under the
statute?
MR. GOTHERs

I have not seen that in the briefs, but

we nave computed — we have given an exhibit in our reply
brief of the instructions in computing your tax under 1041 and
in the example of working it out in the form.
The court in Statler made the same observation.
I da not anticipate that the government would refute that.
So they are not applying it literally.

They are not even

And

12
applying it literally in another context and that is in the
context of the 691 deduction.

The 631 deduction is a deduction

for the amount of estate tax attributable to income in respect
of a denudent item.
There are a series of cases which says that that
deduction, if it relates fc© capital gain taxable to an estate,
that deduction works as an exclusion from the capital gains
tax face,

And the government itself in the Sidles case argued

that that 691 deduction reduced the capital gains tax base
from 100 percent to something less than 100 percent.
,

So clearly the literal interpretation is not one

which is there for the government.

Our interpretation, it

seems to me, is as literal as theirs.

And ©urs does no offense

to the basic —
QUESTIONS

But the government position does not reduce

the amount distributable to the charity, does it?
MR. GOTHER:

That is correct.

That is their position

here.
QUESTIONS

There is just less money in the estate?

I mean you pay out more tax.
MB„ GOTHER:
QUESTION %

You pay out more tax.
But it does not reduce the amount dis­

tributable to the charity?
MR. GOTHER;

That would depend upon how the tax is

allocated under your will —- how the tax burden is allocated.

13
QUESTIONS

Well; what about in this case?

Is the

charity hurt?
MR. GQTHERs

Yes*

Any tax payable out of the residue

of this Estate is going to reduce the amount going to charity
under the terms of Mr. Disney's will.
QUESTION?

You mean the will was specific in that

respect?
MR. GOTEER?

The will was specific in that the

charity shared in the net residue *»“ 45 percent of the net
residue^ this would be a residue charged.
QUESTION?

Is the will in the record incidentally?

MR. GOTEER?

Yes, it is.

Getting to the conduit argumentf one other point
that 1 want to emphasise very much is that the Ninth Circuit
and the government both contend that this conduit principle
does not apply to the amount going in this pot over here to
charity.

And they cite as an example of that Section 643(a)(3).
Mow 643(a)(3) is a very complex section; but the

position they take is that that section provides that capital
gains that are in the pot going to charity are included or
added to distributable net income.

That is absolutely wrong ~

absolutely wrong.
If you read through 643; 643 starts with the concept
of taxable income.

You have some taxable income now and you

want to determine how much, of that taxable income is going to be

14
taxed to a testable beneficiary.

So taxable income already

has a distributions deduction off, already has a charitable
deduction off and so you have got to kind of gross this back
up to see how much is going to foe taxed to the beneficiary.
And in the process of grossing up, one of the things
they gross up — or one of the things they cio is they — 643(a)
(3) aays you exclude all capital gain.

So they were in taxable

income, but now you are going to take them out.
When you take them out, if you take out 100 percent
of the capital gain, you would take out also those capital
gains which are going to a charity, but they are already out
of taxable income.

So you would be taking them, out twice if

you did that.
So the statute has a double negative there, and they
said, no, no, do not take out all the capital gains.

Leave in

there the capital gains that are going to stay in the trust
and are going to ba taxable to the trust, and the gains that
are permanently sat aside for charity, those having already
been deducted above.

So you cannot contend that distributable net income
includes any capital gains passing to charity.

It was a basic

error in the Ninth Circuit's opinion and a basic error in the
government5 s brief.
As an example of that, the Ninth Circuit then goes on
to say another example of why the conduit, theory does not apply

15
to this pot of gala set aside for charity over here is that
Section 663(a)(2) says that — excuse me# 652(a)(2) says that
when you are going to allocate distributable net income in a
particular circumstance among taxable beneficiaries# you take
distributable income and then it says in parenthesis "and add
to it the amount of the deduction that you have taken for charity
under 642(c).
Well# obviously# distributable net income# therefore#
does not include anything going to charity?for the limited pur­
pose of 662# they have that added back»
So the basic error that 643 does not provide that
distributable net income includes the amount going to charity»
The limited purpose of this add-back in 662 of the 642 charitable
deduction is — has nothing to do with estates as such»
seldom

does it apply to estates»

Very

It has something to do with

taxable income of trusts and it has to do with this concept
of tier beneficiaries# that they wanted to make sure — Congress
wanted to make sure that the taxable beneficiary for whom
income was required t© be distributed would pay the tax on the
maximum taxable income# not reduced by anything that was
permanently sat aside for charity.

And it just sets up an order

of priorities# as we see it# of these —

Did the will say currently distribute this

So if I die and I have a business — I tell

my Executor operate my business until you can sail it? then
sell it, sell all my stocks and bonds, and then take the cash

to a charity, now does the Estate pay any income tax?
MR. GGTEER?

No, it does not, Your Honor.
Ever?
That is the essence of the 642(c)? 642(c),

charitable deduction, is an unlimited deduction.

MR. GOTHERs

That is correct.
Is that the law?
That is the law.
Is there any argument about that law?
No.

the course of the Estate proceeding in an Estate where the will
provides that ultimately all of the assets are to pass to
charity — all of the income, even if that Estate were open
ton years

would ba free of tax.
QUESTIONS
MR. GOTHERs
QUESTIONS

Now there is no question about that?
No question about that.
What you are saying when you say that is

18

that the tax exempt entity is the de facto owner from the instant
of the death, are you not?
MR. GOTHRRs

Me are.

W® have even cited the Probate

Code Section .in California which embodies that concept? that
in an estate proceeding the assets of an estate really title
vest in the beneficiary subject only ~QUESTXQN:

indicated that in these statutes that that exemption should
attach from the outset —

MR. GOTHER:
QUESTION:
with the. whole case?

Xt

Could you help me on one problem I have
One way of stating the issue for the

year 1967 would be? X think? to say that you are contending
that the word "excess'5 in 1201(b)(1)? the alternative tax
computation, is $275?000? and the government contends it is
$500,000 because you take the 45 percent out first?
MR. GOTHER:
QUESTION:

That is right.
Do you make the same contention with

respect to the word "excess" in 1202?

19
MR. GQTHERs
QUESTIONi
MR. GOTHERs
QUESTIONS

Identical.
You contend it is 275,000 in either case?
That is correct.
But you did not so compute it when yon

stipulated what the ordinary tax would be.
that pussies me.

That is one thing

You computed it as $500,000 in your statement

of why you have to use the 1201(b) procedure to get the lower
tax.

You agreed to the government*s computation under 1202.
MR. GOTHER?

Not when we got to the computation of

the alternative tax.
QUESTIONs

No, no, in the computation of the normal

method of computing, you agreed — when you get your comparison
deciding which one to use, you did the normal tax by treating
$500,000 as the excess and you stipulated that was the right
way to do it.
MR. GQTHERs
was set up.

Only because that is the way the form

W© were not doing it because we are saying —

QUESTION %

Well, you did not follow the tax form

on your computation.
HR. GOTHERs

No, we did not? we could not.

The

computation that we used we had to exclude at soma point this
45 percent of the gain going to charity.
QUESTION:

You see what my problem is?

I think you

stipulated there was $500,000 under 1202 and you argued that
it is 275,000 under 1201(b).

And I do not know how you cam have

20
it both ways»

Maybe you made an unwise stipulation»

I do not

know»
MR» GOTEBRs

Perhaps,, I asa not sure? but maybe the

confusion is with the 1202 section itself.

The amount that

passes to charity in the capital gains situation really gats
deducted the way the Code sets it up in two categories:

a half

of that capital gain gets deducted in the 642(c) charitable
deduction and the other half in the 1202»
Now those two interrelate and 643 has reference to

.

1202

QUESTION:

I think your return used 500,000 for that

purpose.
MR. GGTKSR:

lie had to get all of the gain going out

to charity deducted out in two places.
QUESTION:

Well, you could have computed the 275,000

from the very beginning, it seems to me, and had quite different
figures on it.
MR. GCTHER:

Yes, we could have.

this came up in the Ninth Circuit.

As a matter

of fact,.

Wo could have: in the very

basic capital gains schedule, when we had 500, we could have
deducted 45 percent there and then went on with the calculation.

The fact that you did not suggested to. me

that you thought the word "excess® had a different meaning in
the two different sections.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Ferguson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. OAP.R FERGUSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FERGUSONs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the court;
I am afraid our differences are more basic than I
had originally anticipated from reading the briefs.

The govern­

ment simply does not accept the basic premise that there are
three pots or three conduits or three shelves, whatever 'they are.
QUESTION;

What 'would you say, Mr. Ferguson, about

Justice White's hypothetical case

if

the entire estate were

given to the University of California or some recognisable
tax entity that was exempt, income tax on these earnings during
the period

of probate proceedings?
MR, FERGUSONs

Sir, I would have to say that, first

of all, the Estate is nonetheless a taxpayer, a private tax­
payer under the provisions of the Code as it would be in any
other case.
QUESTION;

You mean until distribution the entity

takes on the cloak of the decedent and not the cloak of the
legatee?
MR. FERGUSONs

I think that is one way of looking at

22
it.
QUESTION %

Well, is it not just that simple in the

long run?
MR. FERGUSONs
QUESTION s

I think it is that simple.

Does it pay tax or does it not on its

current income?
MR. FERGUSON:

It depends upon whether or not the

provisions with respect to the ultimate distribution to a
charity qualify as a charitable deduction for —
QUESTIONS

Let us assume that it does.

MR. FERGUSONs

If it does,, then the charitable

deduction would eliminate any taxable income assuming
QUESTION:

While the Estate is open?

MR. FERGUSON;
QUESTION:

That is correct.

So that essentially you agree with your

brother's answer with the qualification that it is a qualified
charitable deduction?
MR. FERGUSON:

I agree that as long as it is a

charitable deduction which qualifies and the amount of that
deduction equals gross income, there would be no net tax due
from the. Estate.
QUESTION:

In other words, it has the same status

under that theory as though the decedent had made a gift on
the last day of his life?
MR. FERGUSON;

Exactly.

There are certain limitations

23
on the charitable deduction which apply to an Estate which would
not have applied to the decadent, and there are likewise certain
benefits or allowances which would not have been permitted to
the decedent during his life.
QUESTION:

But you seem to agree that that was the

basic intent of Congress,, to put the ultimate distributee in
the shoes of the testator who made a gift inter vivos?
MH. FERGUSON:

No, Your Honor, I do not.

I think that

the ultimate intent of Congress was to treat the Estate as
a taxpayer separate and apart-from'the decedent

on the one hand

and separate and apart from the distributees) and beneficiaries,
on the other hand.
QUESTION:

If I hear you correctly, you have answered

the same question in two different ways now, Mr. Ferguson.
MR. FERGUSON:

Your Honor, your example posited a

particular kind of estate, one in which the entire residue was
to go to charity.

In that case, I would assume that the pro-

visions of the Estate would be sufficient to satisfy the
conditions of the charitable deduction, and leave no net
taxable income..
For that reason I answered your first question that
there would be no net taxable income.

In response to your

last, question, which was whether there is a general intent of
Congress to exempt all income going ultimately to charities, as
my learned friend suggested, X must disagree with that.

24
I think that the clear intent of Congress was to
strain all items of gross income coming into the custody and
management of the Estate through the Estate’s gross income
and through the deductions which are allowable so as to make
sure that any amounts which are paid out or set aside to charity
meet the conditions of the charitable deduction.
And if they do not, then the Estate has a tax, a tax
which it pays and which obviously ultimately becomes a burden
on that part of the residuary estate indicated by the will to
bear the burden of the tax,
QUESTION %

Mr» Ferguson, in the government's view

who held title to this share of the residue?
MR» FERGUSONs

We do not dispute that under the

provisions of California law title to all parts of the residue,
personalty and realty? was vested as of the moment of death
in the ultimate takers, charitable and non-charitable.
QUESTION s

So you do concede that legal result?

MR. FERGUSONz
is irrelevant.

Oh, indeed.

We think, however, that

In fact, I had not thought that there was a

significance to that.
The taxpayer did not contest on brief that the estate
was a taxpayer with respect to the property which it was
administering.
Even this ingenious argument which is suggested becaus
of some dicta in Bowers versus Slocum does not go so fair as

gross income of the estate, all of it.

Indeed, it is

There is a case not

cited in the parties' briefs in which the tax court considered
the effective California law, and that case is Estate of Cohen,
8 Tax Court 784.
The tax court followed the general rule which had
been followed in many other earlier cases that title to property
does not define the gross taxable assets in the estate.

The

estate for sub-chapter J purposes — sub-chapter J being those
sections dealing with the income taxation of estates — is
defined in Section 641 to include all income arising from assets
within the custody, management and control of the Executor.
■These assets, the shares of stock in Walt Disney
Productions, were clearly assets of the estate, and when those
assets were sold, they generated gross income for the estate.
The estate indeed, as Bowers versus Slocum pointed out in page
351 of that Second Circuit's opinion — and I quote from page
351s

"Cannot escape from taxation except by taking the deductions

provided therefor” in the statutory scheme.
So X think that the question properly framed is
whether the payments here in question constitute a deduction
which is allowable under 1201(b) in the calculation of the
alternative tax.
QUESTION:

This may be elementary, Mr. Ferguson, but

X take it that the government submission — and perhaps it is

26
conceded by both parties for income taxation an estate is
treated as an entity in a way that it is not in moat states
for purposes of decedent*s estates*, where you have the Executor
as an individual and the distributees as an individual, but the
estate is simply an accumulation of assets«

For income taxation,

then the estate is an entity.
MR. FERGUSONt

Yes, sir, that i3 correct.

Sub-chapter

3, I think, makes it clear that an estate, like a trust, is
a taxable entity which is taxable as if it were an individual
according to Section 641 with the various modifications in that
general scheme set forth.

" -■

i

One of the modifications which is critical here Is
the different kind of charitable deduction permitted.

An

individual, for example, can take a charitable deduction by
giving property to a charity.

An estate may not.

hn estate

my only claim a charitable deduction if it can establish that
the amount paid a charity was out of its gross income.
There is no dispute here that the capital gains which
were set aside for the charity were out of the astate*s gross
income.

I had not

The 45 percent

thought there was such a dispute anyway.

of the residue of the estate which was earmarked

for qualified charities meant -that 45 percent of the capital
gains generated by the estate, its capital gains, qualified
for the charitable deductions set aside in arriving at the
estate taxable income.

27

And I think that is where we must begin as Judge
Sneed did in the Ninth Circuit by pointing out that in the
normal computation of an estate * a taxable income, its capital
gains are first computed, including all of the sale of the
shares of stock.

The 1202 deduction, the deduction of 50 percent

of the capital gains is then computed on the full amount of
those gains which would include the 45 percent as taxpayer's
first position had indicated.

And then the balance left in taxable income, after
an appropriate adjustment for the fact that there has been a
1202 deduction already for part of those capital gains, is then
permitted as a deduction under Section 642(c), as long as it
meets the conditions of that section.; that is, they must be
permanently set aside for charity.
The set aside deduction is really a rather special
deduction because it involves allowing an estate to take a
deduction for an amount not actually paid out.

There is,

ii

obviously, room for abuse for sheltering income which will be
going to the private beneficiaries of the trust.

And for that

reason the set aside deduction, like the rest of the charitable
deductions in 642(c),is

restricted tc gross income items.

Now if I may proceed from that basic point, which I
/

think is the statutory scheme, the estate must report and take
into account all of the gross income which it generates by
sale of the estate assets

28
QUESTIONs

There is really no argument about any of

these things»
MH9 FERGUSON;

I had not thought so.

We come now to the question of whether the estate
in computing its fca.it on its net taxable income can achieve a
lower rate by using the so-called alternative tax under 1201{b)
by combining this deduction, for charitable contributions with
the 1201(b) alternative lower tax rate by offsetting it against
capital gains,
I think that the reasoning of the Wail case, the
reasoning of Judge Sneed below and the reasoning of the tax
court in the Stabler Trust case which was reversed by the
Second Circuit all are perfectly consonant with the assumption
which this Court made, both the majority and the dissenting
opinions in Foster Lumber that the alternative capital gains
tax is a tax upon all of the capital gains of the taxpayer,
unreduced by deductions which, as my learned friend has
described them, are taken into account in arriving at taxable
income, so-called ordinary deductions,
QUESTION;

Is it not true that the Ninth did not

follow
MS, FERGUSON;

That is quite true, Your Honor,

The

Ninth Circuit agreed with the tax court decision in Stabler
Trust which the Second Circuit by a divided vote reversed,
- So it seems to me, if I can refer to it this way, the

29
line up of authorities directly on point would be the Stabler
Trust tax court decisions, the Ninth Circuitus opinion below in
this case? and the Sixth Circuit's decision in the Weil case*
and, of course, the dissenting of Judge Dooling in the Second
Circuit against the majority opinion in Stabler Trust»
QUESTION$

Mr. Ferguson, is that quite fair to treat

the Weil case because that was not an estate case, was it?
MR. FERGUSON s

The Weil case was a charitable deduction

case involving an individual.
QUESTIONS

So it really did not present this problem.

MR. FERGUSONs
QUESTION?

I think that is correct.

And if you are right that in the alternative

tax computation, 1201(b), you do not reduce capital gains by
deductions which may be taken against ordinary income, how do
you reply to the argument in their reply brief about reducing
the capital gain for distributions to non-charitable beneficiaries?
MR. FERGUSON

%

That, Your Honor, is a place where

we do depart from the literal language of the statute.

However,

I would suggest that the statutory scheme which we must look
at is 120.1 and 1202 together? 1202 which is the normal method
of tax if the alternative computation is not used specifically
provides that capital gains which are distributable to bene­
ficiaries under 662 -- 661 which do not include charities —
these are the so-called private or taxable beneficiaries — are
not taken into account in making the capital gains computation

30
of the estate or trust.

That is because the statutory scheme

of Subchapter J, as we have heard from the taxpayer, treats
the taxable entity of the estate or of a trust as essentially
sharing in the income with its taxable beneficiaries to the
extent the income is currently distributable.
Now to the extent the income is currently distributed,
the conduit rule which has been taken out of context and used
for the charitable deduction — but the conduit rule, as
Congress explained it in the committee reports, is appropriate
to treat the estate income currently paid out as carrying with
it a share of all of the- various categorias of income, including
capital gain.
Sines the individual beneficiaries will receive a
part of the capital gain currently of the estate, will each
make their own election whether to use 1202 or 1201(b) — I
really should not call it an election? that is an alternative
tax computation.
QUESTION j

That la a requirement, is it not?

MR.FERGUSON:

That is a requirement.

But sine© each will make their own individual com"
putation, the applicability of 1202 or 1201(b) to each bene-»
ficiary will be separately determined.

I would have been clearer if a similar sentence had
also appeared in 1201(b) with respect to —
QUESTION §

What if in this case the income had been

31
currently distributable in these years to a charity,, would
you agree then that the charity should be treated like the
taxable distributees?
MR. FERGUSON;

Your Honor, there are two cases

below which involve —QUESTION;

I would have thought you would have said

yes from your description.
MR. FERGUSON;

The answer is no because charity

the two questions which have reached this question in the
Court of Claims in the Mott case and the Tax Court very recently
in the 0 * Connell case have both held that the charity cannot
be a distributee of DNI under any circumstances.

It is not

a beneficiary within the 661, 662 scheme.
In fact, Section 663, as Judge Snead pointed out,
specifically holds out charities from the scheme.
QUESTION:

And it is that difference, Mr. Ferguson,

that makes you say that the administrative practice with respect
to non-charitable distributees described in the petitioner's
reply brief is not inconsistent — under which you basically
do follov; the conduit concept is not inconsistent with the
argument you are making in this case?
MR. FERGUSON;
QUESTION;

There is that difference?

MR. FERGUSON;
QUESTION:

That is right, Your Honor.

That is the difference.

That a charity cannot be a beneficiary or

32
is not a statutory beneficiary?
MR* FERGUSON:

Right, and distributees are.

So that

the allowance for a charity is the charitable deduction, which
is a true deduction from taxable income*
Now the 691(c) cases which deal with what is clearly
a deduction are by their terms not deductions in arriving at
taxable income.

It is a special deduction as indeed -the

Meissner case made this point and distinguished the Tax Court8s
decision in the Stabler Trust case, and also distinguished
the Weil case and said those cases involved deductions in
arriving at taxable income.
QUESTIONi

Real deductions?

MR. FERGUSON:

Real deductions.

And it said that

691(c) in same Pickwickian sense perhaps was like a credit.
It was like an offset to the capital gain.
And as you know, the United States had a great deal
of difficulty in accepting that line of cases, but the cases
themselves distinguished the 691(c) deduction from the deduction
which we are here considering and I think properly so.
I think that the cases here flow from the same — the
decision below ±3 consonant with both opinions in Foster Lumbar
in that the decisions do recognise that the 1201(b) computation
relates to all capital gains without subtractions for deductions
in arriving at taxable income.
The special 691(c) deduction, I think, can foe

33

explained as an offset in the nature of. a credit to make sure
that items which were taxable subject, to the estate tax are
not again subject to an income tax, which might duplicate and
indeed exceed the principal amount of the item itself.
There are special considerations there, I think, just
are not present in any of the so-called ordinary deductions
described.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Ferguson, I said this seems to answer

the sare question in two different ways, and I realise that
in these exchanges here can make the difference.

And let me

' try again even with tho risk of over-simplifiaafcioxi.
Taking Mr. Justice White9s hypothetical case that
Mr. Disney left everything, his entire estate after the expenses
of administration, to this tax-exempt entity, do I understand
you concede no income tax during the pendency of the probate
proceeding — no income tax after the date of death, is that
right?
MR. FERGUSON;

Assuming — Your Honor, if I might

add one more fact, I can agree with you.

Assuming that the

gross income of the estate could be offset by a deduction under
642(c) which mat the various requirements of that deduction
section, I would agree.
QUESTION;

In other words, the tax-exempt ultimate

distributees takes hold at the instant of death, rather than
having the Executor stand in the shoes of the decedent?

34
MR. FERGUSONs

Your Honor. again I have to disagree.

Perhaps I can offer another illustration of why we are having
trouble of coming to a common agreement as to the nature of
the taxable estate.
Let us suppose that the Executor had the duty to
make payments from income or corpus as necessary to provide for
the comfort and well-being of Mrs. Disney and the children, but
that any amount not so expended would then ba left in its
entirety to charity.
In that case because of the discretion, the conditions
in 642(o) would not be mat.

The amount going to charity would

not be guaranteed and the estate would be fully taxable on all
of that income.

There would be no refund for the amount

ultimately determined to go to charity.

Charity, indeed, would

take the amount,which it will take here as a residuary legatee,
reduced by whatever expenses including income taxes the estate
encounters during the course of administration.
I think that every case

even the extreme case you

have suggested, if an estate left outright to charity, the
estate must file an income tax return to report its gross
income and demonstrate that the income earned does .qualify for
the charitable set aside deduction.
QUESTIONS

But if it does in the Chief Justice8s

question, even though the entire income is capital gains income,
you would not need the alternative tax, you would just make the

35

deduction?
MR. FERGUSON:

Clearly, in that case the lower tax

would be the regular tax.
QUESTION s

Without the alternative tax?

MR. FERGUSON:
QUESTION:

That is right.

You are required to figure the alternative

tax, I guess.
MR. FERGUSON:
QUESTION:

Clearly.

Mr. Ferguson, that has nothing to do with

the estate law at all.
MR. FERGUSON:
does.

No, Your Honor, we do not feel that

That has been decided long ago, that the placement of

title is irrelevant to custody and management of the assets
which is the activity generating the tax liability and the
reason that Congress has seen fit to treat the estate as a
taxpayer.
Now if I may return for one moment to the so-called
confusion as to the development of the charitable deduction,
I think fcliat the preoccupation of the Second Circuit and of
counsel for the taxpayer on Section 643 and the computation of
DNI is irrelevant.

I think for purposes of this argument we

would be willing to concede that the taxpayers' version of
the computation of distributable, net income and its attack
on the example which we set out in our brief is correct.
3ut we do submit that that is just utterly irrelevant.

36
You come to the question of distributable net income only after
you have arrived at taxable inconte.

And in the course of that,

the taxable .income of the estate has started out with gross
income, which includes all of the capital gains, and then hag
been diminished by that part of a charitable deduction or that
part of a set aside for charity which comes out of gross
income»
And it is only at that point, after you have arrived
at taxable income, that the ESI or distributable net income
adjustments become relevant»
We suggest that the only point of looking at the
distributable net income schema is to demonstrate, as Judge
Sneed did, that the only conduit, the only distribution theory
of Subchapter J, has to do with private beneficiaries who share
in the tax load to the extent there io a current distribution
of income.
To the extent the income is retained, it remains
taxable to the estate regardless of how it is ultimately
distributed.

And the charity set aside deduction of 642(c)

is simply one of the deductions in arriving at taxable income.
When you go to look at the alternative tax in 1201(b),
we suggest that there is no more reascxx for pulling out the
charitable deduction than there would be fox- pulling out the
Executor’s commissions which may be deductions in looking at
the way the computation of net capital gains is to be made.

3?
We suggest the court was quite correct in its
assumptions in both opinions in Foster Lumber that net capital
gains means net capital gains for purposes of the alternative
tax.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER3

You have a few minutes

left, Mr. Gother.
REBUTTAL OF RONALD E. GOTHER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. GOTHER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Just one quick point:

Do not be misled by the use

of the word ’’deduction*’ in 642? 642 speaks of it in terns of
a deduction, and I think the government is emphasising that
word more than need be. 642 provides for an unlimited deduction
arid it provides that it is available even if there is not
a distribution.
You put those two concepts together, and you have
gut something other than a deduction.
QUESTION:
MR. GOTHER:

Well, some deductions are unlimited.
Some deductions are unlimited but only

if you have paid them out.
QUESTIONs
MR. GOTHER:

Yes, but your second point is —*
My second point is that you do not even

have to pay if out.
QUESTION:

Then that is contrary to the ordinary

38
concept of a deduction.
MR. GOTHS R:

Also the deduction that you get for

distributing amounts to a taxable beneficiary under 661 —
to a taxable beneficiary — is worded as a deduction? the same
word, deduction, but it works to take that capital gain out
as an exclusion.
So do not be misled by the word ^deduction”.

Thank

you, Your Honor.
QUESTION!

What do you have to say just before you

sit down, Mr* Gother, about Mr. Ferguson9s explanation of the
adiuinistrative practice pointed out in your reply brief that
you assert is inconsistent with tha position the government takes
in this case?

Do you know what I am talking about?

MR, GOTHSRi
QUESTIONS

No.
The government*s treatment of non-charitable

devisees, legatee, distributees administratively is said to be
in your reply brief inconsistent with the argument the govern­
ment is making in this case in that that administrative treat­
ment of non-charitablo distributees seems to rely or recognise
the conduit theory.
And now you have heard Mr. Ferguson9s explanation of
the difference, i.e. that charities are not beneficiaries within
the meaning of the statute, and that that explains the difference
in practice which he concedes does not follow the literal terms
of the statute with respect to non-charifcafele distributees.

39
MR. GOTHSEs

The answer to that is that the charitable,

entity does not need this deduction, this distribution.

It

does not need to be a distributee to, get the deduction.
The taxable beneficiary needed that and that is
the. conduit which carries the taxable amount off to the taxable
beneficiary.

The charity because of the fact that it gets this

deduction without a distribution just was not unnecessary to
deal with a charitable entity as being a distributee.
QUESTION:

Is that to avoid double taxation of the

taxable distributee in part, that deduction allowance?
MR. GGTHER;

No.

X do not think it relates to a

double tax.
QUESTION;

Well, if it was taxed in the estatevs

income and then taxed again to the distributees9 income —
MR. GOTHER;

Oh, yei, that is right.

You need the

distribution out to eliminate the double tax on that. And in
the case of the charity, you do not have that.

You are not

eliminating a double tax.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.
