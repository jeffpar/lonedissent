MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Daniel Burch against Louisiana.
Mr. Peebles, I think you may proceed when you are
ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK PEEBLES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PEEBLES s

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here by way of certiorari to the Supreme
Court of the State of Louisiana.

The question involved is

whether the Louisiana constitutional provision for trial by
jury of six persons in certain criminal cases, with five
required to deliver a verdict, meets or offends the Sixth and
Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution.
In the Louisiana constitution of 1S74, which is now
in service, we have three categories for criminal juries.

In

capital eases, 12 out of 12

In

are required for conviction.

cases requiring hard labor, 10 out of 12 are required for
conviction.

And in lesser felonies, such as the one in this

case where the judge may impose hard labor but does not
necessarily have to, you have a jury provision of six parsons,
*

five of whom must concur in any verdict.
Q

Including a not-guilty verdict? is that correct?

MR. PEEBLES:

Yes, that is correct.

4
One of the six could be for the finding of guilty?
but if the other five are for a finding of not guilty, that
is the verdict»
MR. PEEBLES:

That is correct, Your Honor.

In this case defendants Daniel Burch and Wrestle,
Incorporated, the corporation involved, were each convicted, on
two counts of obscenity under the state obscenity statute.
Specifically they were alleged to have shown obscene movies
in a coin-operated machine in downtown New Orleans.

There were

two charges, two convictions, and Burch was convicted and
sentenced to two seven-month terms of imprisonment, which were
suspended.

He was fined a thousand dollars.

The corporation

received a $600 fine on each count.
0

Are you making any point about the corporation

here?
4

MR. PEEBLES:

Yes, Your Honor, we are submitting

that their case should be considered along with Burch's.
Q

All right.

MR. PEEBLES:

The only rationale we can present to

the Court as to why their case should be considered is that
they were tried under the same statute.

By way of analogy, we

would submit that Duncan v. Louisiana shows an analogous
situation.

There, if the Court will recall, this Court

determined for the first time that a defendant was entitled to
a jury in a serious criminal case.

In Duncan's case the maximum

5

sentence that could have been imposed under the statute was
two years.

In fact, Duncan was only sentenced to 60 days, and

at argument the—
Q

Here the vote was six to nothing--

MR. PEEBLES;
O

Yes, Your Honor.

—on the corporation.

HR. PEEBLES:

That is correct.

And I am saying that

by analogy, as in the case of Duncan, there the State of
Louisiana argued that since Duncan in fact received a sentence
which itfas not, in legal terminology, a serious sentence, he
should not be permitted to argue his case.
Court did reach the merits on that case.

Nonetheless, the
That is the onlv

analogy that I can think of which would suoport this Court’s
entertaining the argument of
Q

Wrestle, Incorporated here.

Under your theory than, anyone who was convicted

in Louisiana under this particular section of their constitu­
tion, even though by a unanimous six-man jury or six-person
jury, would be entitled to be free?
MR. PEEBLES:

I do not know that the decision would

have to be retroactive, but I think they could have raised
that point under that argument? yes, Your Honor.
However, there is no question but that Burch, who
was convicted by a five-to-one vote, is properly here whether
or net Wrestle should be considered by this Court.

Our argu­

ment is essentially that the combination of the non-unanimity

and the reduced panel
Amendments.

offends the Sixth and Fourteenth

This Court has said in Williams v. Florida that

six out of six is constitutional; it said that in 1970.

And

in Ballew v. Georgia you said that five out of five offends
the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.

Here we have a case

where you have five out of six, and the Court must decide
whether that model offends the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
1 think it goes without saying that many of the arguments that
we might use would apply to the Ballew decision—five out of
five—and many of the arguments that the state might make might
apply with equal vigor to the Williams v, Florida decision
regarding six out of six.
Q

What about six out of twelve?

MR. PEEBLESs

1 do not know of any case in which

the Court has decided that issue, Your Honor.
Q

I am talking about this very case.

MR. PEEBLES;
tution—

In this case, Your Honor, the consti­
'

Q

If you had gotten six out of twelve, you would

get the same as if you got six out of six.
MR. PEEBLESs

You still have six people voting to

convict or to acquit; that is correct, sir.

But that is not

required by the statute in this case.
Q

I do not know whether you are arguing about

figures or unanimity.

7
MR, PEEBLESs

Here you have both aspects, the non-

unanimous character of the Louisiana statute and the fact that
only six are required to constitute the jury*, with only five
required—■
Q

Do you think that that is still open, the six-

rran jury is still open?
MR, PEEBLES:

No, that was foreclosed by Williams v.

Florida.
0

Yes „

MR. PEEBLES:

This Court has said the six-man jury

with a unanimous verdict is constitutional.
0

Bo, you are not arguing that.

MR. PEEBLES:
0

No, sir.

In Williams,
however, the Court did indicate that it
......

preferred the unanimity factor.

In the Court's statement at

that time, in the opinion, you said that you did not feel that
there were any major reasons why the six-man jury would not be
constitutional as contrasted with the twelve-man jury, par­
ticularly if the jury was required to come back with a unani­
mous vote.

Of course, we do not have a unanimous vote here.

So, the question arises, If you do not have a unanimous vote,
does that change the character of this body, which we call a
jury, so that the essential features of the jury in its
classical, institutional form are inhibited?
it does

We submit that

8

Q

When you say classical form, traditional form,

what do you mean by that, twelve?
MR. PEEBLES;
Q

I am sorry, Your Honor?

Do you mean twelve?

MR. PEEBLES;
the purposes for the

No, Your Honor.

I was referring to

jury that the Court has previously

indicated, requiring adequate deliberation, a cross-section of
the community, that sort of thing.

I think the question that

this Court must decide is whether the non-unanimous six-man
jury adequately protects those features.
Q

The six-man jury is all right in terms of just

the cross-section.

There was a six-man jury here.

MR. PEEBLES;
Q

There was, Your Honor.

So that there was a jury,

hnd in terms of

deliberation, would you say that if there is a split vote, it
indicates more deliberation or less?
MR. PEEBLES;

It indicates less deliberation, Your

Honor.
0

Why, if there is a split vote?

MR. PEEBLES;

I believe that some of the sociological

studies indicated in the Ballew decision indicate that if there
is a split vote so that only a majority is required or a
percentage with not a unanimous vote, then there is less
*
deliberation in so far as time is concerned than there
ordinarily would be

9

0.

The five people here at least have had to face

up to a dissenting vote, have they not?
MR. PEEBLES:
Q

Yes, sir, they have.

Let us say it was a Negro defendant and one of

‘the six jurors was a Negro.

The five others could just say,

"Well, you go over and play Solitaire in the corner, and we
will decide this case."
MR. PEEBLES:

That is our argument, Your Honor.

We

submit that that is correct.
Q

But you do not suggest that that is present in

this case, do you?
MR. PEEBLES:

W?e do not know what happened in the

jury room in this case, Your Honor.
Q

You are not suggesting any hypothesis about

that?
MR. PEEBLES:
Q

We are not suggesting any hypothesis.

On that point that you were discussing with

Mr. Justice White, when I was in law school, it was common for
the lecturer to say that a divided court opinion carries more
weight--carries more weight--than a unanimous opinion of a
multi-judge court, whether it was three on the court of
appeals or nine here, because that showed the issue was
contested right to the end of the line.
that with the sociological studies?
has about the same value perhaps.

How do you square

I suppose each of them
This was the wisdom of

10

lawyers and law teachers until at least a few years ago»
MR. PEEBLES?
of

Of course, Your Honor, we have no way

knowing exactly what goes on in a jury room,
Q

Nor what

goes on in 'the conferenceroom of a

court of appeals or a state supreme court.
MR. PEEBLES?

Yes, sir.

But it would seem logical

to me that a jury which requires only five out of six would
not have the vigorous debate that a jury would have if all six
members were required to bring back a verdict.

I think some

of these sociological studies have indicated that in cases
where a non-unanimous jury was the one in question, the time
that they stayed out was less.
Q

Those are the same sociological studies that

said a jury of less than twelve was bad because it reduced, the
chances of acquittal.
MR, PEEBLES?
Q

Yes.

hnd, by the same token, a jury of 24, 36, or 48

would cut the other way, would it not?
MR*. PEEBLES ?

Those were the same studies, Your

Honor»
Our position here is that you have said in Ballew
that five men are not adequate to represent a cross-section of
the community and to give adequate deliberation in a jury room.
Q

That is if they are all alone,

MR. PEEBLES;

Yes, all alone? that is correct.

11
Q

If they do not have the number six there,

MR, PEEBLES :

Yes, sir.

Our position is that by merely adding another
individual to that jury, whose vote is not required in order
to bring back a verdict, you have not essentially changed the
nature of that jury.
jury.

It still remains essentially a valid

In some respects it is even worse.

One of the points

made by Mr. Justice Blackman in the Ballew decision was that
the smaller jury resulted in less hung juries, which ordinarily
inursjs to the benefit of the accused.
Of course, in our situation, where you have five out
of six, as contrasted with five out of five, you are likely
to have even fewer hung juries,

Therefore, it is even more to

the detriment of the defendant.
Q

Mr. Peebles, I have a problem with this cross-

section of jury.

How many would you need in New York City?

MR. PEEBLES:

How many would we need in order to

have—
0

To have a cross-section of Manhattanites—about

8,000, would you not say?
MR. PEEBLESs
suppos©, sir.

That would be the perfect ideal, I

This Court has said that six is adequate in

Will,jams v. Florida.
Q

That is why I am not trying to reargue that one,

MR. PEEBLESs

The Court has said that, and we do not

12
quarrel with that position.

The question is, Is that the

absolute minimum required so that no change can foe made which
would

reduce the potential for deliberation and cross-sectionYour argument is that if you buy six, you mean

Q

six unanimously.
MR. PEEBLESs
Q

That is your point.

MR. PEEBLES;
Q
with a rule.

Yes, that is correct.

That is right.

All a court can do is deal with the system,
You cannot deal with individual jurors.

Even

with a twelve-member unanimous jury, you might have twelve
peas in a pod—
MR. PEEBLES;
Q

That is correct.

—on any particular jury and no cross-section

at all.
MR. PEEBLES s
Q

That is correct, sir.

But one deals with the system.

MR. PEEBLES;

That is correct.

In reducing the jury to six, you have really gotten,
we suggest, to the very minimum that you could have by way of
*

cross-section.

As was pointed out in the Ballew decision, if

you have a segment of ten percent of th© community, which
represents a particular viewpoint, and you only have a six-man
jury, then statistically on the average more than half the
juries you select will not have any representatives of that

13
ten percent viewpoint»

The Court has held that sis out of sis

is constitutional? but if you add to that the factor that not
all sis votes are required in order to bring back a verdict,
we submit that if then there is any legitimacy to the argument
that five jurors may be less -than fully impressed with the
argument of that sixth juror;, then you have gone below the
line of that which is constitutional»
Q

Do you relate this to the burden of proof in
l

criminal cases as distinguished from the burden of proof in
civil cases?
MR» PEEBLES?
0

1 would, Your Honor.

Most of the states permit a five-sixths verdict

in civil case, do they not, sometimes after a certain lapse of
time?
MR, PEEBLES s
which do that.

I am not familiar with any courts

That may be the casa.

I do not think there

are any other courts which permit it in criminal cases other
than Louisiana.
We would also suggest that there is no legitimate
state interest which would validate their reducing the number
of jurors required to convict below six.

As the Court has

said :ln the Ballew decision, if such an interest did exist-and of course there would be maybe argument or reason for
/

permitting the five out of six model.

However, the only

results here that might inure to the benefit of the state

14
would fee the reduced time required for jury deliberations and
the reduced number of hung juries.
Q

Is there not some interest too on behalf of the

state in not taking people away from gainful employment in
order to serve as jurors if they can get by with less?
MR„ PEEBLES;

I think that is a legitimate reason.

But us are suggesting simply that that type of reason, which
I think is essentially the same as the argument I suggested—
it would reduce the deliberation time, same kind of thing-™!s
simply counterbalanced by the fact that you are reducing the
■very nature of the jury beyond that which people commonly
conceive to be a jury.

It is something less than a jury, we

would suggest.
Q

How is that state interest served by removing

a requirement of unanimity?
MR. PEEBLES:

1 do not understand.

Oh, it does not.

I understood from

Mr. Justice Rehnquist that he was speaking of a six-wan jury.
He would not object to this situation because we still have to
have six people there no matter what, and they have to be paid.
1

Presumably they would not hang as often, and they would be out
for shorter periods of time.

We suggest that these are simply

not sufficient reasons for the state to—-that would counter­
balance what we think are the grave problems that would be
presented with this type of jury.

The statistics have shown

that—-and as is indicated in footnote ten of Ballew—-that with

13
a twelve-man jury you have juries that hang, if the twelve men
are required to come back unanimously, about five percent of
the time.
If you reduce that same panel to six, with a unanimous
return, you have about half that number of juries that will
hang.

If you then still go further and eliminate one of those

jurors as a mandatory vote, I would suggest that you have
practically eliminated the hung jury in our system and given
our value that we would rather see fen guilty men go free
than convict one innocent man—I would suggest that the hung
jury has its place.
Q

Us a mathematical proposition, a hung jury can

be of benefit to a defendant on a five-to-one basis, four-totwo basis, just as surely as it can be to the prosecution,
MR, PEEBLES;

That is correct, Your Honor.

In that

regard, im would call the Court’s attention to the fact that,
as Professor Saisel I believe has pointed out—and this was
quoted in the Ballew decision—th© average juror has a pro­
pensity to convict.

So, although that is mathematically

corrcict, it would not probably result in it®

Most juries that

are hung are hung in favor of most votes in favor of convic­
tion but. with one or two holding out for not guilty®
the statistics would show this®
Q

I believe

Yes, Your Honor.

This is an unfair question, and I hope it has

not been asked when I was out of the room.

Suppose the

16
Louisiana statute provided for a seven-man jury and the vote
was six to one, do you think under the result in Ballew that
that conviction would hold up constitutionally?
MR. PEEBLESs
Sonor.

That would be a closer question, Your

I would suggest that it would not.

Quite frankly—

you asked my impression—my impression is, if you get any
further away from what has been considered the classical jury
system, twelve out of twelve, you are reducing the protection
below the constitutional minimum,,

And X would say that any­

thing that does not require a unanimous jury below six would
not be constitutional.
Q

How about ten out of twelve?

MR. PEEBLES;
tutional.

The Court has held that that is consti­

But you have more total members there of the jury.

If 1 may address myself to that point, Your Honor, these
studies have shown that when you have as many as twelve jurors
and yoti have a minority of two or three, they are much more
likely to maintain their minority viewpoint in the course of
deliberation than they are if you have a very small jury of
about six where perhaps only one has a minority view.

He is

much more likely, as a result of the conformity pressures on
him, to giv© up his views.

So that it is entirely likely that

although nine out of twelve, as in Johnson y, Louisians., or
ten out of twelve, as Apodaca v. Oregon—
Q

How about eleven out of twelve?

17
MR» PEEBLESs

Eleven out of twelve?

The Court has

held that that is legitimate, that is constitutional»

But you

have enough jurors there so that if you do have a minority of
two or three, they can still work together and hold out for
this minority viewpoint.

If you reduce that down to as low as

six, however, and you only have one minority member, we submit
that he is much sore likely to give in.

And thus the panel

loses-”
Q

Of course in Balley/ many members ©£ the court

were not very impressed with what then/ called the numerology
of the studies.
MR. PEEBLES?
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

X suppose they are less impressed here.

Ballew

was not court opinion®
MR. PEEBLESs

Yes, it was the court judgment.

Yes,

there were a number of opinions in that court, and 1 recognise
the fact that members of the Court differ over the approach
in Ballewo

I thought I should address myself to it because

it certainly was there.

And, as Your Honor said, if you do not

rely to some extent ©n the social studies, 'then you com® close
to just using judicial hunch.

And if you are not going to

rely on history—or at least you conclude that history is not
going t© give us the final answer as to what this jury—
«

Q

Mr. Peebles, 1 am not being critical because, as

yon know in what was written in Ballew at least, I gave

13
substantial weight to the studies.
MR. PEEBLES;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

But not everybody was in agreement.

MR. PEEBLES;

Yes, Your Honor.

We would hope that

the Court would review the question of the history of the jury
system, which is held not to be controlling in the Williams
decision and subsequently in Apodaca.
The amicus brief in this case has presented even
further evidence with regard to the intent of fch© framers of
the Sixth Amendment, which the Court may wish to consider.

I

do not think that a review ©f that question is mandatory to a
favorable decision for the petitioner Burch in this case.

But

we would certainly have no objection to the Court considering
it.

if the Court has no further questions, that will conclude

jay argument.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mrs. Korns.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. LOUISE KORNS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRS. KORNS s

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Of course it is the State of Louisiana's position in
this case that because this Court approved a six-man jury in
Williams v. Florida and majority verdicts when a substantial
number of the jurors agree in Apodaca v. Oregon and Johnson v.
Louisiana, that a five out of six jury verdict is

19
constitutionally unassailable under all the reasons brought
forward by this Court in Williams and Apodaca and Johnson»
Q

You said that since

we have approved a six-

member jury * then a fortiori we would have approved a sevenmember jury»

If that is all it is* then just -the numbers

four out of seven would—as 1 understand your position»
MRS» KORNS%
right on this ease»

Our 'position* Your Honor* is anchored
We have a six-member jury* and five of

them brought back a verdict.

And the defense in this case

made no attempt—1 would like to jump

to an argument that

was made during my predecessor’s argument where it is feared
that the two horns of the dilemma were social studies on one
side* judicial hunch on the other»

It is the State of

Louisiana's position that there is a third position* and it
is the only valuable position»

That is actual court studies

which take place not grabbing 15 cases here or something, but
with all the computers and everything available today it
would be not impossible and not all that difficult to actually
put into the computer every majority verdict ease in Louisiana*
compare it to a like number of cases in other unanimous
jurisdictions»

This has never been done although this Court

suggested in Johnson v^ Louisiana that until such evidence was
presented* it was not going to set aside the will of the
Louisiana legislature in its presumption that a majority
verdict was perfectly constitutional»

20
I would like to point out to Mr. Justice Blackmun
I think he will be particularly interested in this and I was
particularly interested in it because of his reliance on
empirical data in Ballew.

tod 1 point out in my brief that

the data is sort of divided, not completely but in general,
that an-the-scene, actual life studies of these majority
verdicts of smaller juries, judicial proceedings—the actual
in place studies generally favor these smaller juries and
these majority verdicts where the mock juries and deductive
modeling ones generally tend to disfavor them*
I would like to point out that coming right out right
now are articles by Professor Bernard Grofman, Associate
Professor of Social Sciences at the University of California at
Irvine.

He brought ona out at the end of last year, "The Case

for Majority Verdicts."

He is bringing one out right now.

By the. way, I will just put in parentheses he is being funded
in this by the National Science Foundation, its Social
Sciences and Law Program®

He has been funded in this.

He has

brought out "The Statistical Cass'for Majority Verdicts" and
two other articles which he has sent to this Court apparently.
But, anyway, the State of Louisiana does not want the
Court to rely on this but just merely points out that even
these statistical data, professors are sharply divided.
Professor Stuart Nagle will tell you by all kinds of formulas
this long in X3 s and parentheses that the chances of convicting

21
an innocent person increase as yon get five out of six, whereas
Bernard Grofman will tell you by other formulas , equally long
and complicated, that his position that he urges in these
articles--and it is surprising in a way because it is counterintuitive*—is that a six-member majority verdict jury is more
likely to protect the innocent than a twelve-member unanimous
verdict jury.
I am not telling this Court this because I urge them
t© rely on it»

1 am telling them this because of the dis­

array that exists among these theoretical thinkers on the
subject.

And our position is that if the National Science

Foundation can fund a statistical research program like this,
why can they not fund a national in place study of what
actually happens in Louisiana under the majority verdict
system that will go on for maybe three or four years and
collect actual, hard figures so that we will no longer be
speculating about what happens but we will see what happens?
Q
stand.

Are you saying—1 just want to be sure 1 under­

1 have not read that particular study.
MRS. KORNS;
Q

It is just coming out.

It suggests that it is easier for the prosecutor

to get a conviction when he has to convince twelve people to
agree unanimously than it is to convince a majority of six
parsons?

It sounds rather infallible.
MRS. KORNS:

Your Honor, I am just telling you what

22
Professor Barnard Grofman's article-—it is one of the things
that he proves with these formulas.

He concludes, "Tims it is

shown"--first of all, I have to admit, in all honesty, that
he prefers a twelve-man jury to a six-man jury.

But his

proposition is that if this Court finds a certain group of
people constitutionally adequate, a six-man jury like in
Williams Vo '.Florida, then there is absolutely nothing wrong
with a majority verdict.

He even goes so far as to advocate

a simple majority, simple majority-Q

Is he advocating it on the ground that it is

harder to persuade a majority of six to convict than it. is to
persuade all twelve of the twelve-man jury t© convict?
MRS. KORNS:

Apparently he is, Your Honor.

But 1 do

not understand all his formulas.
Q

Do you support that argument?

MRS. KORNSs

Your Honor, as 1 say, 2 do not understand

these mathematical formulas, to tell you the truth.
0

I would not understand that on© either.

MRS. KORNS:
ground.

I d© not have any mathematical back­

And all of these articles are Greek to me as far as

their underlying reasoning goes.
Q

I think maybe the term "numerology" may apply to

what he wrote rather than to what Mr. Justice Blackman wrote.
MRS. KORNS:

I just cite this to this Court, as I say,

because here is Professor Stuart Nagle—

23
Q

It may be that a prosecutor in the jurisdiction

that he studied does not bring a case for violation of the
misdemeanors that have six-man juries unless the proof of
guilt is overwhelming, whereas he does bring felony prosecu­
tions if there is probable cause to bring the prosecution
before a twelve-member jury»

There are all sorts of facts

that could skew those studies»
MRS<. KORNSs

Right,

I think he is working though

not on actual court studies at all.
you»

That is what I am telling

This is one of those fanciful things.

He is working on

figures that he gleans—-just like Professor Stuart Nagle
does—from Kalven and Zeisel*

That is what all these other

peoples did, taking these figures out of that, and then getting
their computers out and working out all these formulas.
But, anyway, as I say, I just mention it to this
Court because I think particularly Mr. Justice Blaekmun would
be interested in these articles because they are coming right
out of the University of California and they are right on this
point.

But fortunately for vis, they are on our side this

time o
Anyway, the state's whole position in this ease—the
State of Louisiana's whole position in this case, of course, is
that under Williams and under Johnson and Apedaea a five out of
six jury is perfectly constitutional.

We feel that if any kind

of data are going to bs used against our position, we fael that

at least these experts ought to be put on the witness stand
in the trial court, qualified as experts like a doctor or
anybody who is going to testify about insanity, give testimony,
the same kind as they write in these articles, and be subjected
to cross-examination on conflicting articles just like a
psychiatrist is when he gets up and testifies about insanity.
We feel that if Louisiana8s majority verdict is going
to be thrown aside, it ought to be on concrete evidence
showing that unfairness results and not on speculation which
is just in the realm of very interesting theories but which
have never been—

Mrs. Korns, is it speculation—would you contend

that it would be speculation that it would be harder to
persuade five out of five to convict than it would be to
persuade five out of six to convict?
or does it not

Is that just speculation,

seem rather obvious?

MRS. KORNS;

Our position is that in a five-out-of-

six jury, Justice Stevens, which is what we have here—
Q

Yes.

MRS. KORNSs

--this jury would have reached unanimity

95 percent of the time.
Q

In other words—

But they did not this time.

MRS. KORNSs

They did not this time.

But if a six-man

jury, five of whom—if a six-man jury had to be unanimous, they
are going to become unanimous 95 percent of the time.

25
Q

Right»

MRS» KORNS:

And ones the vote reaches one to five,

the one is not going to turn around the five.

So, all he is

going to get is a five percent chance of a hung jury, and the
state can try him again and have just as good—X mean, a very
high chance.
Q

So, what is he loraing, really?
That really dees not respond to my question»

My question is to compare the requirement of unanimity in a
five-man jury, which the Court has held is not enough—
MRS o KORNS:
Q

-

Right.

--with the requirement of getting five out of

35.55 to convict.
MRS.3 KORNS:
Q

Oh, 1 understand, yes.

Would you not agree that it is easier to get

five out of six—
MRS„ KORNS;

Yes, in other words, why if Ballew is no

good, are we net any good?
Q

--than it is—let me finish ray question.

Would

you not agree that it is easier to gat five out of six to
convict than it is toget five out of five to convict?
MRSo KORNS:

Your Honor, I am going to avoid that

question because 1 do not think that is the issue.

The issue

is—
Q

I think it is, and X would like you to answer.

MRS. KORNS:

The issue we think is, Is the six-man

2S
panel valid as a cross-section of the community as a protection
against tyranny and so and so?*—-which this Court not only found
in Williams but upheld and reaffirmed in Ballew.
Q

You just do not want to answer my question then.

1 do not suppose the answer will help you.

That is probably

why.
MRS» KORNSs

All right, we rely on Apodaca v, Oregon

and Johnson v. Louisiana.

And when the present Louisiana

cons ti tution—
Q

Which eases do not answer my question.

MRS . KORNS % Whether it is—
Q

I am just asking you whether you think we need

statistics to demonstrat® what I regard as a rather obvious
proposition, that it would be harder to persuade five out of
five to convict than it would foe to persuade five out of sis:
to convict.
MRS. KORNS 2

Yes, but this Court did not strike down

five-out-of“five juries on that basis.

It struck it down

because if was not a fair cross-section of the community, that
when you get below six—so, respectfully I do not think that
is an issue here because the reasons for striking down Ballew
ar© not here.

This Court said in Ballew you have got to draw

the line somewhere, and we draw it at six.

And we reaffirm our

holding in Williams, and a six-man jury gives a sufficient
cross-section of the population, provides a bulwark against

27
tyranny-”"
Q

Then your argument* Mrs» Korns* you say my

question is totally irrelevant to that analysis»

But under

your analysis then* four out of six would also be .
because you still have your six people»

adequate

In fact* three out of

six would foe adequate.
MRS» KORIES;

Of course * in Williams the whole argu­

ment was* How far down are we going to go?
Q

IN fast* I do not know why* under your analysis*

you could not have a jury that said if any one ©f the six
believes he is guilty* that is enough»
MRS. KORNS;
bar© majority verdict»

Scotland from time immemorial has had a
tod* as I say* there are people who

will argue* like this Professor Grofman* that once a jury has
swung to a bare majority* the chances that it is going to go
bask are so infinitesimal that you may as Wellcome out then.
I do not take any position on that because that is not my case.
And in Williams I think members of this Court asked* "How far
down are we going to go?”

And the answer in that case was*
i

t!We will stop it some time»”
it»

And in Sallow this Court stopped

I do not think it is* frankly* a question hare that if you

uphold five out of six that you are going to have to—I mean*
it is clear from Ballew* the way you drew the line under
Williams * that if yon uphold five out of six* it dees not mean
at all that yon have to uphold anything more under that.

And

28

having upheld tan out of twelve in Apodaoa* five out of six
is just half of it®
Q

Two out of three would be even better.

MRS. KORNS 2
six.

This Court has said you cannot go below

So* obviously we are not going to get below six.
Q

Now you are at five in your state.

MRS. KORNSs
six.

And even 1 can understand that.

No* Your Honor* we have six* five out of

We have to have a six-man jury.
Q

That is all Ballew decided* was the total

number.
MRS. KORNS z

Right* the total number* and reaffirmed

Williams many times.

Mr. Justice Blackmun said* "We reaffirm

everything we said in Williams as far as six being enough and
six serving all these important constitutional functions of a
jury.
Q

If the vote of one of them does not count* it is

not six* is it* even though that person may be sitting in the
bOK?

MRS. KORNSs

X would like to point out in this ease

that obviously the vote of one did count* and he was listened
to because the jury deliberated for SO minutes.

It was

unanimous for the corporation and five to one for Burch.
vary facts show that the juror5s one vote did count.
on© way in one and one the other.

Those

He voted

And it is obvious just from

those facts that they listened to him* that he voted one way in

29

on© and one the other# and that he never would have turned
around the other five in the Burch case.
Q

Mrs. Korns, you missed an opportunity to point

out that this Court allows dissenting opinions and dissenting
votes, but we count them anyway.
MRS. KORNS :
Q

No doubt about that, absolutely.

Like all the people who voted for Alf Landon in

1936, their votes were counted but Franklin D. Roosevelt was
president.
MRS. KORNS:

If the members of this Court do not have

any further questions, I will submit the matter, Your Honor.
Q

Mrs. Korns, I might say this.

You mentioned a

little while ago that 95 percent of your cases are unanimous.
MRS. KORNS:

No, I said that both Professor Nagle

and Kalven and Seise! and everybody agree that—Q

X am talking about Louisiana's experience, that

95 percent of your six-man jury come in with a—
MRS. KORNS:
Q

No.

How many do?

MRS. KORNS:

If i said—
What is the percentage?

Nobody has ever kept—-that is my very

point, Your Honor.
Q
with a

In any event, certainly some of them feat coma in

five“to-one conviction vote, if you had a unanimity

requirement, might come in with a unanimous vote—
MRS. KORNS:

Oh, 95 percent of the time they would

30

under general rules of the way juries behave.
Q

Because once you get to five and one, it is all

over with.
MRS. KORNSs

And the others are tired of listening to

it arid they either bully or persuade the other person to give
in.

Just like in the old days? they would not give them any

light or heat or food , and they dragged them from courts from
one town to the other until
Q

finally they all said—»

They do all this in Louisiana, do they?

MRS«, KORNS:

We would like to, I think, Your Honor,

but we cannot.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Peebles?
■MR. PEEBLES:

Not unless the Court has any questions,

Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel, the

ease is submitted.
