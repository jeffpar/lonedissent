MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Alexander against the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, and the consolidated case.
Mr. Vandarstar, I think you may proceed whenever
you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN VAN DE RS TAR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 77-874 AND
RESPONDENTS IN 77-1463
MR. VANDERSTARs

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr.

Chief Justice, may it please the Courts
In the fall of 1974, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development evicted nearly 200 families from the.tr homes
in two federally subsidized housing projects?

one located

in Indianapolis and one in the Anacostia section of Washington,
D®

Co

HUD had acquired those projects after the project
sponsors defaulted on their mortgages, which HUD had insured.
Both projects were in need of rehabilitation and the Anacostia
project, called Sky Tower, was halfway through the rehabilita­
tion process,
HUD analysed the costs of completing the rehabilita­
tion or performing the rehabilitation, analyzed the expected
revenues from the projects and a number of other factors, and
in each ease made the decision to evict the tenants and then

4
sell the vacant property fco private developers.
Some of the Sky Tower tenants,, the Anacostia tenants ,
received moving allowances of $300 each, some did not.

But

— and none of the Indianapolis tenants received moving
allowances.
Moreover, HUD did not satisfy itself before evicting
these people that there was some place else they could live,,
some placa they could afford.

The effect on these people was

devastating^ especially on the larger families, the elderly,
and the poor — which is what most of these people are.
In the Cole record there are some illustrations»
Mrs. Irma. Francis, her rent want from $77 a north to $155 a
month? she9s employed and earns $400 a month and supports three
children.

Mrs. Sadie Cole, her rent went from $84 a month to

$156 a month? she receives $228 a month in public assistance?
she has two children.
Mrs. Jean Fisher, her rent went from $84 a month to
$189 a month? her monthly income is $243. She also has two
children.
Judge Gesell found that the impact of this move on
the larger families in the Anacostia project was especially
serious because of the shortage of housing, low-cost housing,
especially for large families in this city.

As he pointed out,

the waiting list at public housing projects in Washington,
most of them in the four-bedroom and larger categories, exceeds

5
4,000 families»
New, it’s difficult for most of us in this room to
imagine trying to live under those conditions» But Congress
knew about those conditions»

It informed itself, it studied

this problem over a course of many years, and it enacted a
statute, the Relocation Act, and in that Act it said:

"We

don't lirant this to happen again? that whenever there is a
federal dollar being used for a federal project, we don't want
to displace people from their homes, unless — unless »— the
agency is satisfied that these people have some place else to
live? some place they can afford»"
Both sides in this case agree that the critical
statutory language in the Relocation Act is the definition, and
in particular the so-called "written order" clause in the
definition, of "displaced persons".
A displaced person is someone who "moves from real
property" either as a result of the acquisition of such real
property -- that's the acquisition clause — or as the result
of the written order of the acquiring agency to vacate real
property

that's the "written order" clause»
And in either case, it has to be for a program or

project undertaken by a federal agency»
QUESTION: And you are here under the written order
clause?
MR. VANDERSTAR:

Yes, Your Honor»

If I had to put;

6
my case in a nutshell, I would say that the language of the
"written order" clause covers the tenants in these two cases,
and that that result is perfectly consistent with the
congressional purpose in enacting the Relocation Act.
The acquisition clause was relied on below, but it's
not relied on here.
QUESTION; Would you say that this is at the core of
the purpose that Congress had in mind?
MR. UANDERSTARs

By this displacement, yes.

Certainly the whole focus of Congress's study, going
back to 1961 — nine years before the Act became effective —was on displacement cai^sed by federal programs or federally
assisted programs — which are not pertinent here.
The written order clausa, I think, plains

covers

these people. They moved, as a result of a written order of
the acquiring agency, namely IIUB, the agency that had acquired
these properties, and the orders were issued pursuant to a
federal program or project.
What was that proqram or project?

It's spelled out

in about 150 pages of material in the HUD Handbook called the
Property Disposition Handbook, which describes the property
disposition program that is to be employed by HUD when it
acquires properties through mortgage default.
It's perfectly clear, we submit, that there was a
program or project that led to the displacement of these

7
tenantso

It’s perfectly clear that a written order of the

acquiring agency caused their displacement, so the written
order clause applies0
Now* let’a see if that make3 sense.

Let’s look at

the statute over-all and see if that makes sense.

It seems to

me that the best place, if it please the Court, to look for the
over-all intent of Congress is in the section entitled
’’Declaration of policy”, which is Section 201 of the Act»

And

it says this:
"The purpose of this subchapter" —* and that’s the
relocation title of this complex statute •— "is to establish a
uniform policy for the fair and equitable treatment of
persons displaced as a result of federal and federally assisted
programs in order that" — and I’m still quoting — "in order
that such persons shall not suffer disproportionate injuries
as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public
as a whole»"
So the emphasis is perfectly plain„

The emphasis

is on persons displaced as a result of federal and federally
assisted programs»

These tenants ware displaced as a result

of a federal program.
There’s another place we can look in the statute for
evidence of congressional intent»
language.

It’s more statutory

And that is in S€5ction 206(b),

I might point out

that this statute covers not only tenants and not only home-

8

owners, but it also covers businesses end farmsc

But in

Section 206(b), Congress made it quite clear that where people
were being displaced from their homes, Congress had a special
concern, as you would imagine*

And in Section 206(b),

Congress used these unequivocal words?

"No person shall ba

required to move from his dwelling on or after January 2,
1971, on account of any Federal project, unless the Federal
agency head is satisfied that replacement housing, in
accordance with Section 205(c)(3) is available to such person*"
Now, Section 205(c)(3) refers to replacement housing
that meets a great number of characteristics*
important one, I submit, is this one?

And the most

"at rents or prices

within the financial means of the families and individuals
displaced”.

There are others as well.

But it seems to me clear that in 201, the declaration
of policy covering the statute as a. whole, and in 206(b), that
portion of the statute which announces Congress's policy with
respect to displacement of people from their home, from their
dwelling, that these people were intended to be covered by
the Relocation Act,
QUESTION s

Is it your contention that the word

"person" in 206(b) is more broadly defined than the term
"displaced person" in the definitional section?
MR, VANDERSTAR? ’I think that's a fair reading of
the statute, yes, sir.

But I'm relying on 206(b) primarily

9

simply to establish as clearly as I can the over-all purpose
Congress had in mind in enacting the statute.
But the answer to your question is yes, I think it is
broader*
QUESTIONS

Mr, Vanderstar, you don't see any connec­

tion between the acquisition section and the written order
section?
MR# VANBERSTARs

Wall, I don’t think that there’s a

connection —
QUESTIONS

Are they entirely different, in your

view?
MR# VANDERSTARs
parallel#

Yes, sir,

X think that are

I think you go through one route or you go through

the other# and it doesn’t matter, as long as you —
QUESTION»

Well, .if you're just on the acquisition

route, thcsn you don't, need a written order or anything?
MR# VANDERSTARs

That’s right, and I think that

helps to explain •—
QUESTION»

And therefore if you’re on the written

order route, you don't need the acquisition?
MR# VANDERSTARs

Exactly#

Exactly#

We think there has to be an acquiring agency, because
the written order clause talks about a written order of the
acquiring agency#
QUESTION;

7,1s that the main point that's before us

10

right

row?

MRo VANDEESTAR5
QUESTION?

Yes, sir»

That's why you were so willing to drop

the acquisition one?
MR0 VANDERSTAR?
QUESTION?

Well, the clause —

Because if you keep that one, you're gone,

MRo VANDERSTAR?

Well, it8a a weaker argumenb, I'll

concede that. Your Honore
QUESTION?

I seec

MR» VANDERSTARs

But certainly the written order

clause is the one we rely on hare0
Now, it's been suggested by the government in their
briefs that this statute should not be read in the way I have
outlined»

That the written order clause should not be applied

to cover the tenants in these two ca3es0
Why is that?

Well, the government's principal

argument, if I can take the liberty of putting words in their
mouth, is that the program or project that leads to the
eviction has to be the same program or project that led to the
acquisition, so that if you have an acquisition for one program
or project, and than you have a displacement for another
program or project, the government contends, those displaced
tenants are not covered»
I find it hard to sea where that interpretation comes
from»

There's certainly nothing in the legislative history,

11
and there’s certainly nothing in the language of the statute
that supports that interpretation»

Indeed, I think it quite

clear,as I have indicated, that Congress was focusing on dis­
placement»

This is not an Internal Revenue Code, this is not

a statute that is meant to be read restrictivelyy this is not
a statute in which the words are meant to be words of limitatioHo

This is —
QUESTIONS

Isn’t one place it might come from the

fact that traditionally under eminent domain cases moving
costs were not an allowable element of just compensation, and
Congress just decided to add that as an element of just
compensation here?
MR» VAN DE RS TAR ;

That’s one possible interpretation,

but I don’t think it’s a permissible interpretation»
QUESTION;

You say it’s permissive but not

permissible?
MR» VANDERSTARs

No, I say it’s one possible inter­

pretation, but I don’t think it is a permissible interpreta­
tion»

I don’t think this is an eminent domain statute»

I

think Section —
QUESTION;

Yes, this is not an eminent domain case,

because you’re not acquiring this, you’ve already had ihis»
MR» VANDERSTARs

That’s correct» This is not an

eminent —
QUESTION;

Eminent domain has nothing to do with this

12

particular case,
MR, VANDERSTARs

No, sir.

Nor, X think, does

eminent domain define the outer limits of the statute0

I

think Congress made it clear that it was talking about dis­
placement, not about eminent domain,
Nov;, it is true —» it is true ~ that all the
hearings and all the reports and all the discussion, or

at

least most of it, that led up to the enactment of this statute
was talking about eminent domain, that type of acquisition.
There"s a good reason for that.
There were very few programs then in existence under
which HUD could come to acquire a property because of a
mortgage default»
Furthermore, there were probably no cases -- but I
don't know that, because it's not in the record — in which
HUD not: only acquired a property after mortgage default, but
then evicted the tenants,
QUESTIONS

Well, what about a person who simply

defaults in their rent, and is given a written notice to move
from the property because of default?
MRo VAN DE RS TAR s

Well, I don't think the words of

the statute cover that person, and certainly the sense of the
statute does not.
of contract.

That's a person who has committed a breach

And the ordinary remedies for breach of contract

are — include the one you've suggested,

I don't think that

13

that is a person who has moved as a result of a written
order of an acquiring agency for a program or a project.
That8 s a «—
QUESTIONs Well, what8s lacking?

Certainly the

written order is there,, The written notice of default.
MR. VANDERSTARs
program or project.

One thing that’s lacking is the

I don’t think that what caused that

particular tenant to be displaced is a program or project.
I don’t think that was to set up "or pursuant to a program or
project", that was then in process.
QUESTION?

Well, the program is simply not to allow

tenants to remain in the property who don't pay chair rem.
who are very destructive or whatever.

ojl

That’s part of the

program.
MR. VANDERSTARs

Yes, sir.

But I think that — and

certainly the written order evicting a person who did not
pay their rent or defaulted on their mortgage is issued
pursuant to that. But 1 don’t think that*3 the kind of program
or project Congress had in mind.
QUESTION;

But it does coma;, as my brother Rehnquist

suggests, it does seem to come within the literal language of
the statute, if your case does.
MR. VANDERSTARs

I think the cases are quite

different.
QUESTION;

The cases are factually quite different,

14
but the question is whether or not they fall under that literal
language of the statute, as you construe that language.
MR. VANDERSTAR;

I don't think so, because I construe

the words 51 program or project" in a different way.
and the tenants contend

I say —

that "program or project" is a

decision by the agency, a programmatic decision relating to
that property which leads to eviction of the tenants.
QUESTION;
QUESTION;
QUESTION;

Well, -Than it's —
— then it precisely describes Mr.

Justice Rehnquist's hypothetical case.
MR. VANDERSTAR;

I don’t think so, Your Honor, with

all due respect.
QUESTION;

Then it's an eminent domain type of case.

If your answer to Justice Stewart's question is no.

If it’s

a program that simply says people are going to be evicted from
their existing housing who don't pay their rent is not within
the thing, then it has to be an eminent domain type of thing,
where they are taking over property.
MR. VANDERSTAR;

Well, eminent domain *— there was

no eminent domain used here. The way HUD got the property was
because of the mortgage default and HUD's decision to fore­
close on the mortgagej in both cases, mortgages.
HUD did not acquire the property through eminent
domain.

In a sense, I suppose one could say that by taking

15

over the leasehold interest of the tenants in these two sub­
sidized housing projects, HUD has acquired their leasehold
interest and has evicted then pursuant to that acquisition»
That, X think, is a permissible reading of the statute, and
it leads you to the same result that we seek on our reading
of the written order clause»
I think the main problem with the defaulting tenant
or the defaulting mortgagor point is there's nothing in the
sense of the statute, in the purpose of the statute, that would
suggest that that's what Congress might have had in mind»
Congress did not focus on all the people who breach contracts
and then suffer the consequences,,

Congress focused on and

had in mind the people who are displaced because of federal
programs that caused displacement»

And X think that what

Congress had in mind was the kind of federal program that we
have heres

a federal program under which IIUD finds itself,

as it probably should have expected to find itself in a good
many cases, with a property after a mortgage default and after
HUD’s decision to foreclose on the mortgage»
Nov?, what's HUD going to do with that property?

It

goes into its property disposition handbook and develops its
property disposition program and it reviews all the costs, and
it reviews whatever other factors are in that enormous handbook»
And it makes a considered choice among different alternatives»
And the choice it made in these two cases — and I

16

suggest that it makes rarely, but it does make them from time
to time —” is to shut down the project, sell the property to
somebody else, and recover the government's money»
Now, the question here is, if there are going to be
costs to the tenants, who is goinq to bear those costs?
it be the tenants?

Will

Will it be the very families that Congress

was focusing on in nearly ten years of study of this reloca­
tion problem, will they bear the brunt of that displacement or
should we all bear it as taxpayers?
QUESTIONS

You necessarily treat the government's

efforts to collect on its indebtedness as a program in the
same sense that building a bridge or a new road, a new highway,
is a program? is that so or not?
MR» VANDERSTARs
It is a program»

Yes, Your Honor»
It is an act taken by the govern­

ment, designed for the public as a whole»
I mean, recall please that HUD is not a commercial
lending agency, to use Judge Gasell's words»

IIUD is in this

business for a much broader and very different social purpose»
HUD was established by the Congress and all these Housing
Acts that Congress has.been passing for the last 40-odd years
have not established HUD as a bank» tod so —
QUESTIONs

But it functions as a bank when it tries

to collect, on its debts, on its guaranties, does it not?
MR»

VANDERSTAR:

Well, it functions as a creditor

17
when it tries to collect its debts0
QUESTIONs

A creditor.

Well,, it fractions the same

way a bank does when a bank forecloses a mortgage,
MR, VANDERSTARs

Not completely, Your Honor,

Because a bank has stockholders and it has other interests
that it has to be answerable to,
QUESTIONS

HUD —

Well? the mechanics, the mechanics are

the same, are they not?
MR, VAN DE RS TAR s

The mechanics may be the same, but

the decisional process is very different,

HUD is not •'-» does

not and should not sit there the way a bank does and say,
"Well, how can we maximise our return on our investment?"
HUD’s purpose is to maintain and increase the nation’s supply
of housing, and particularly for low and moderate income
families.

And —
QUESTION? Well, this program wasn’t doing that,
MR, VANDERSTARs
QUESTIONs

Bag pardon?

This program wasn't doing that. This was

disposing of housing they couldn’t use,
MR, VANDERSTARs

Well, it wasn't housing they couldn’i

use, it was housing they didn’t feel like paying to rehabili­
tate ,

In that sense it was a banker’s type decision,
QUESTION?

In any event, this particular program

decreased the total amount of housing available to the people
they were intending to serve

13

MRo VANDERSTAR?
QUESTIONg

Indeed it did„

If they had, instead of foreclosing —

instead of evicting themselves just after they foreclosed —■
sold the property to some private entity and let the private
party do the eviction and destruction and so forth, the
rehabilitation, then I gather there would be no claim,
because it would not be the acquiring agency that did the
evicting?
MR0 VANDERSTAR?

That would be a much tougher case»

QUESTION? Can you tell me — you mentioned the ten
years of study of this problem by Congress ~ how much of that
study included discussion of problems associated with fore­
closure of mortgages and the

eviction of peopba from projects

like these?
MRa VANDERSTAR?

None that we can find. Your Honor0

Arid I think the principal reason is that those programs, most
of them didn't exist in those days

the 236 program, for

example, that the Sky Tower project was subsidised under, that
didn't come into existence under August 1968„

And it takes

time to get houses built, it takes time for them to go into
default, and then it takes time for HUD to get their hand3 on
them,, And it's very likely — x?ery likely -- that HUD simply
did not have to face this problem before the Relocation Act
was passado
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, if I may

19

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well, Mr. Venderstar.

Mr. Bryson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS IN 77-874 AND
PETITIONERS IN 77-1463
MR. BRYSONs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
In our view, the Uniform Relocation Act applies when
the government acquires property for a public purpose and
people £.re displaced as a result.
It does not apply when the government already owns
property and it orders tenants to move in order that it can
put some other use -- make soma other use of that property.
In other words, we see this Act as, in Mr. Venderstar's words, an eminent domain statute primarily.

In other

words, this statute applies to cases in. which the government
is acting in its capacity as taker of property, whether that
be by purchase or by condemnation.
The plaintiffs view the Act as applicable in cases
inhere —*
QUESTION?

Well, it could be by lease, you could just

be taking possession, couldn't you?
MR. BRYSONs

It could be acquiring a property

interest os that sort.
QUESTION s

Yes

20

MR» BRYSON s

That would certainly be a possible

interest -QUESTION;
MR. BRYSON j

It need not be a fee# in your submission?
That is correct.

But# in any event# it would be acquiring the property#
or at least acquiring an interest in the property.
The plaintiffs view this case more broadly#as they
said# as including cases in which the government is acting
basically in its capacity as landlord.
Nov?# to underscore the difference between the positions
that the parties have taken in this case# let's take an examples
Suppose HOD had acquired this property 20 or 30 years ago?
In that case the plaintiffs would say that if these
people had been — and others — had been living on the property
ever since that time and IIUD decided# at some point# that they
needed to make some other use of the property# perhaps the
property was deteriorating or something, as was the ca3e in
these cases# in any event they decided to make some other use
of the property# then# in the plaintiffs' View# once they were
ordered to leave the property# they would be entitled to
relocation benefits.
We say that isn't the case# because the key element#
the key factor that triggers this Act would be missing# which
would be that the displacement would not have been caused by
the acquisition.

21
Now* we find support for our interpretation of the Act
in the language of the statute* in the context and structure of
the statute* and in the legislative history of the statute,,
Before I go into the language of the statute* I would
like to underscore one point about its context* which is that
the Uniform Relocation Act is actually part of a much broader
statute*

It°s Title II of the Uniform Relocation Assistance

and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act*
In other words* this Act deals with the problems of
real property acquisition by the federal government and by State
government.

The Act was passed in order to remedy some of the

problsras* some of the inadequacies that were perceived in
eminent domain law.

Eminent domain law does not provide

benefits to take care of incidental and consequential expenses
that are suffered by people who are forced to move as a result
of acquisitions of property.
Congress tried to deal with this problem, and a number
of other problems in eminent domain law* with this statute.
Title III addressee a number of these problems. Title II
addresses what Congress perceived as the most serious problem,
which was the problem of relocation of people who were displaced
by acquisitions of property.
Now, going to the precise language that the plaintiffs
rely on, they rely on the definition of displaced persons in
the Act, and particularly on the written order clause, indeed

22

exclusively on the written order clause®
Nov/, the two clauses ~ we’ve been over the acquisition,
clause — the second clause, the written order clause, says
that a person is entitled ~ well, a "person” is defined as a
displaced person? if he moves as a result of the written order
of an acquiring agency®

Now, the plaintiffs say that this

includes them because HUD had acquired the property®
We interpret the words "acquiring agency" to mean an
agency that is acquiring, an agency that is engaged in an
acquisition®

In other words, as we read just these words,

without going any further, we say "acquiring agency'5 has to be
an agency that is more or less contemporaneously engaged in an
acquisition,
QUESTION:

You think it’s a present participle, not

an adjective?
MR® BRYSONj

Exactly®

Exactly®

I think if we look further into the statute we find
further support for this interpretation of the language®
Particularly important, I think, it is to look at the operative
sections of the Act®
benefits®

The sections that grant the actual

When we look to them, we find that those sections

actually talk in terms of acquisition.
people in the position of the plaintiffs®

They don’t contemplate
And that’s the best

key, I think, to what this written order clause really means®
For example, Section 202 of the Act, which is 4622,

23
I believe, in the U« S® Code0 Section 202 applies to moving
expenses.
Now, Section 202 provides for moving expenses for
people who — in which the acquisition will result in a dis­
placement,»

It doesn't contemplate people for whom the acquisi­

tion occurred long ago and who are being displaced by written
order®

It turns on the existence of an acquisitions
Now, the plaintiffs say that this is just sloppy

language and that it doesn't cover our interpretation of the
written order clause either®
Now, our interpretation of the written order clause
is just this %

we say that the written order clause was designed

to take care of the case in which there was a notice to move
in anticipation of an acquisition, but in fact the acquisition
never took place®
Now, there's a very good reason that that written
order clause is in in the statute, which is, to take an
example, suppose Mr® Jones got an order from the Department of
Transportation;

"Jones, we’re going to be taking your property

in two months, it's going to be acquired? be out by June Ibth®”1
And Jones, in reliance on this, logically enouqh, reasonably
enough, decided he'd batter move; and he moved®
Now, if the statute had only the acquisition clause,
and it turned out that the Department of Transportation decided,
after Jones had moved, that they weren't going to take the

24
property after all# Jones would be out of luck.

That's why

tlie written order clause is in this statute# to make sure that
if the Department of Transportation gives Jones a notice# raGef
out by June 15th"# and Jonas moves in reliance on that# it
doesn't matter if there is an acquisition»

And that keys right

in to the benefit section of the Act, because Section 202#
the moving expenses section# provides that benefits are avail­
able when the acquisition will result in displacement» And in
Mr» Jones's case# it is certainly the case that the acquisition
will result in his displacement# even though in fact# as thxngs
turned out# no acquisition took place»
The same thing applies to the Relocation Assistance
Advisory Services that are discussed in Section 205 of the Act#
which is 4625»
Now# again# it uses language that the benefits are
available when the acquisition will result in the displacement,,
This wouldn’t apply to the parties# to the plaintiffs in this
case»

That this clearly indicates that acquisition is the key

here# and that# of course# as we say# our interpretation of the
written order clause is consistent with this agarn»
Similarly# the third operative section applies the
same way# it8s in somewhat different language# but again it
points to the key factor of acquisition as being the heart of
this statute»

And that is Section 204# which is 4624# which

provides benefits to persons who are living in their dwellings

25
at least ninety days before the initiation of negotiations for
the acquisition»
Now, if HUD had acquired this property 20 years ago*
that statute wouldn’t make any sense, if applied in the sense
that the plaintiffs are trying to make it apply»

Because this

clearly contemplates that the acquisition is the core notion
of what triggers the Act»

In other words, the reason for the

90-day gap, the 90-day period here that'3 specified in the
statute is that the Act wants to avoid people coming in two
days before the acquisition, after they've heard that the
acquisition was coming, and getting the relocation benefits»
But it turns basically, again, on acquisition»
Now, looking to the legislative history of this Act,
we see the same point underscored again.

This legislative

history is quite extensive, and we've gone through it rn some
detail in our brief, and I'd like to touch on just a few points
here.
First, the beginning of the consideration of this
problem came essentially in about 1961, when the House Public
Works Committee set up a Select Subcommittee on Real Property
Acquisition,

Nov/, again note — and I harp on this theme again

and again, but it's the core of the case — that this Sub­
committee was devoted to the problem of real property
acquisition.
The Subcommittee came up with a proposal, a proposed

26

statute,, which it entitled the Pair Compensation Act.
Nov,?, as I’ve mentioned, this Fair Compensation Act
was part of the effort to try to make amendments , make some
kind of improvements on bare constitutional eminent domain law,
to try to solve some of the harshness that eminent domain law
produced in various respects, by paying only for the fair market
value of property that was taken.
One of the purposes, one of the aspects that this Act
addressed was the problem of relocation. And interestingly, it
included a section on relocation, which is very similar in
structure to the sections on relocation that appear in the
Uniform Relocation Act.

And, in fact, although the Relocation

Act has provided in some respects more extensive benefits, but
the basic core was here, and what is particularly important is
that the core definitional section was similar.
What the definitional section said was that benefits
are available to parsons who move as the result of an acquisition
or the

imminence of acquisition.
Nov/, the interesting thing about this is that this is

tha grandfather of the written order clause.

We find again and

again the definition of "displaced persons" coming up as Ma
person who is displaced as the result of an acquisition" or —
and then slightly changed language as we go through the develop­
ment of the Act, through its numerous drafts? but it started
with "or imminence of acquisition".

In other words, they were

27

dealing with precisely the kind of problem we are trying to
identify here, which is our friend Jonas who leaves in reliance
on an acquisition coming down the road and the acquisition
never actually takes place? imminence of acquisition,.
Well, that phrase was thought to be too broade
just too vague.

What is ’'imminence of acquisition5’?

It’s

Does

somebody get benefits if he has a feeling what, "Well, I have
a feeling that they're going to be taking my property"?

No,

ha gets benefits only if there’s some ~ there's got to be some
better way to figure when the acquisition is in fact imminent.
So that, although "imminence of acquisition" was the
statutory language that was introduced in the first bill,
following this Fair Compensation Act, that was proposed, it
was changed fairly quickly to "reasonable expectation of
acquisition"0
So the Act read, "A person is displaced if he is
displaced by the”

the bill at that time — "if he is

displaced as a result of an acquisition or reasonable expecta­
tion of acquisition,"

Now, that went through several drafts

of the bill basically unchanged, until we cot down to 1969,
in which the bill finally mads its way into law,
There was a difference, interestingly, between the
Senate bill that was first introduced and the House bill that
was introduced first in this last round of drafts of the
Relocation Act

28
The Sanate bill retained this language that one is
displaced if one is required to move as a, result of an
acquisition or reasonable expectation of acquisition»

Whereas

the House bill that was initially introduced was somewhat more
restrictive»

It said that one is displaced if one is forced

to move as a result of an acquisition or reasonable expecta­
tion of acquisition '"when the property is subsequently acquired15»
So, again, under the House bill Mr» Jones would be
out of luck again.
Well, it was clear that there was a good deal of
difference between these two positions, and they were
compromised.

They were compromised in what became the written

order clause, and that is that — what happened was just this;
that the written order clause was drafted to say, all right,
it will «-» the requirement that there be a reasonable expecta­
tion of acquisition is too broad, standing by itself, there
ought to be some index of probability of acquisition, so we
will say that there has to be a written order to move»
But the requirement in the House bill that the
acquisition actually take place is too restrictive, so we will
simply eliminate that.
And so what they came up with was, as I say, just
this written order clause requiring that there be some kind
of written order to move but not requiring that the property
subsequently be taken»

29

Now, we have pointed out our interpretation of the
written order clause as being a good deal narrower than the
position that the plaintiffs have taken with respect to this»
I would like to point out that IIUD's position is and has been
and continues to be consistent with the recent Act that the
plaintiffs have brought to the attention of the Court that
we attempt to limit displacements of people as much as possible.
It's clear that these kinds of displacements cause terrible
hardship, and there's no question about that, in the hardships
that Hr. Vanderstar recited at the beginning of the hour, we
certainly acknowledge this is a serious social problem.

And

one which HUD has tried to address by restricting displacements
as much as possible.
But the problem is that many of these housing projects
were built 30 or 40 years ago, they are in deteriorating
condition, and some of them are beyond rehabilitation in any
practical sense, so that occasionally these properties do have
to be basically torn down.

Rehabilitation really would amount

to simply rebuilding from the ground up.

So there are people

that do get displaced.
And our contention is simply that this Act, which is
intended to address the problem of acquisitions of property
does not cover cases in which people are displaced from
property that is already owned by federal agencies.
Thank you

QUESTIONS

Mr- Bryson, before*. you sit down? I think

there were, as I remember the facts, some of the people from
Sky Tower who did receive $300 as some kind of relocation
assistance,,
MR, BRYSONs
QUESTION s

That's correcte
Pursuant to what statutory authority was

that money paid?
MR0 BRYSONs

Well, I believe, Mr, Justice Stevens,

that that was under the general authority of the Housing Act,
That has been a problem throughout for HUD, has been to try
to figure out where, under what statute, to find authority
for these kisids of payments.
Act,

It was not under the Relocation

There are provisions under* the Housing Act, in which

basically certain funds can be expended on an emergency basis,
and this, as I understand it, was deemed to be one of those
cases,
But —
QUESTION s

Well, go ahead, if you're

•

MR, BRYSON: Well, I was simply going to point out
that that money was given to those people who were current
in their rents and it i/as an attempt at an accommodation that
we may find through further legislation, we may find some kind
of more explicit statutory authority for, but right now the
authority is rather vague,
QUESTIONs

And there's also bean a «— there was a

31

motion to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, I believe,
filed by your opponent, and I believe they called our attention
to the fact there is pending some new regulations being
prepared dealing with this whole subject matter»

I don't

recall, I didn't look at it, but was that pursuant to some
new statutory authority or is that pursuant to — what is
the statutory authority for what's being done now?
MR. BRYSONs

No, there's several different points

on thi3 score, Mr„ Justice Stevens»
The first is as to the statute, the new statute»
There is a statute which has instructed that HUD will try to
reduce displacements as much as possible, and that there will
be a report which the Secretary will issue in January which
will indicate what the Secretary is doing about the problem of
displacements.
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:

And that statute was enacted this year?
Yes. That was enacted in —
A few weeks or months ...ago»
It was signed October 31st.
Right.

MR. BRYSON: Right. But that essentially is just a
restatement of IIUD policy.

HUD policy clearly is to limit the

displacements as much as possible.

It doesn't provide new

statutory authority for these kinds of payments.
QUESTION:

Is this kind of a directory, to tell how

32
tO ““
MRo BRYSON s
QUESTION3
MR. BRYSONs

Yes.
—- minimize the number of evications?
Exactly.

QUESTION 3 And than requiring HUD to report.
MR. BRYSON3
QUESTIONS
MR. BRYSONs

Exactly.
As to the success of such minimization.
Exactly.

And we believe that it doesn't ~ chat that statute
does not in any way moot this case or render it less important?
for several reasons.
First of all, there are, as I said, cases in which
HUD has to displace people.

Those cases we simply don't change

by virtue of directive to HUD to limit the number of di3”
placements as much as possible? where they have to be

aade,

they are going to be made.
On the other hand, there's a much broader issue
here, which is that this statute applies not just to HUD but
to all federal agersci.es, and it applies, in addition, to all
State agencies that are obtaining assistance by federally
financed programs or projects.
So we’re not just talking about something that
affects HUD, we're talking about something that affects every
State agency that is acquiring property or, by the plaintiffs'
interpretation, that owns property and that it decides to

33

dispose of in some other way»

And when that decision to dis-

pose of the property results in people being displaced»
Thank you, if there are no further questions»
QUESTION

Thank you»

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* Mr» Bryson»

Mr» Venderstar, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN VANDERSTAR, ESQ» ,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 77-874 AND
RESPONDENTS IN 77-1463
MR» VANDERSTAR:

Yes, Your Honor, thank you®

I don’t know whether it’s relevant that some of
these properties are 30 or 40 years old, the fact is that
Riverhousa was built in 1969, and HUD has held the mortgage
since December 1970, and if there’s been any deterioration,
I don’t know why the fingers are being pointed, but perhaps
that’s the place to point the finger®
I do want to talk for a moment about Mr» Jones,
though®

Because the government’s position is that the language

of the written order clause applies to a

proposed but

unconsummated acquisition and. to a displacement that results
from a written notice of intent to acquire»

But the statute

doesn’t say v/ritten notice, it says written order®
Furthermore, the government relies very heavily on
the word ”acquisition” in the sections of the statute other
than the definition, the sections that provide the specific

34

benefits and services,,
Now, I might point out that we concede there was an
acquisition in this case, and we concede that one is required»
So we don’t have a difference between us on that issue.
But the question is, if the acquisition resulted in
the displacement, then the acquisition clausa applies-,
question before the Court is:

The

What happens if something else

resulted in the displacement, if it was a written order, not
the acquisition but a written order?
And we suggest that’s exactly why Congress put the
written order clausa in the definitional section, because if
you had to wait for an acquisition to cause the displacement,
you wouldn't need the written order clause»
QUESTION:

But, Mr» Vanderstar, would it not be

possible that there would be a written order before the
acquisition was consummated and there -MR» VANDERSTAR:

I don't think you'd call that a

written order, and HUD does not»

In HDD's regulation, they

talk about three ways people can qualify in general under this
definition, and they talk about a written notice of intent to
acquire, they talk about an acquisition, and they talk about
a written order to vacate»
We agree with HUD, and we agree with the HUD
regulation, that there are three different situations covered
by the statutory languages

the acquisition; a written notice

35
of intent to acquire, even when the acquisition doesn't take
place, we agree that that is covered.
QUESTIONS

How would that be covered if you didn't

have the written order clause in?

MR. VANDERSTARs
either clause.

I think it could be covered under

The Lathan ca3e in the Ninth Circuit «—

QUESTIONS

How could it be covered if there were

written notice of intent to acquire but no acquisition, and a
written order to vacate?

It seems to me you need the written

order clause to —
MR. VANDERSTARs

Wall, it wouldn't be a written

order to vacate, if it please the Court, it would be a written
notice of intent to vacate.

That's the way HUD describes it,

and that's the way the statutory history describes it»
QUESTIONs Well, the statute, just looking at it, at
a first or second or third, even third glance, seems to provide
two, only two alternatives»
MR. VANDERSTARs

Well, there are two alternative

clauses, but there may be lots of cases that are covered by —•
QUESTIONS
of a written order.

As a result of acquisition or as a result
There’s nothing in there about a written

notice to acquire.
MR. VANDERSTARs

I understand that, and it's rather

curious that the government does not want the Court to apply
the statute the t^ray we think it was written, but concedes that

36

it doss apply in a case that the language doesn't cover»
There is nothing in the words of the statute «—
QUESTIONs

Now, what — I don’t quits understand that,

what do you say fehs government concedes?
MR» VANDERSTARs

The government concedes, indeed

asserts, that a written notice of intent to acquire, even
when there’s no acquisition, is covered by the statute»

I didn't so understand the government»

I may have misunderstood»
MR» VANDERSTARs

That's the Mr» Jonas example that

Mr» Bryson talked about»

MR» VANDERSTARs

I see,

MR» VANDERSTARs

"We're going to acquire thif3 property

so,”

So Mr® Jonas leaves0
Obviously it would be quite unfair to Mre Jones to

deny him benefits and services if the government later changed

We concade that»
But the curious thing is that the %-;ords of the statute

simply don't carry that meaning,,

The obvious purpose of the

t

statute does# and that's what we think the Court should have
in mind when it reads the written order clause as it applies
to this case*
QUESTION s

The written order clause does require

that the written order coma from the 59acquiring agency5',
doesn't it?
MRo VANDERSTARs

Yes# sir*

QUESTIONS So don't you think that that must
contemplate an acquisition as well as the first clause?
MR0 VANDERSTARs

Yes, and there was an acquisition

in both of these cases,
QUESTIONt

So the written order isn't separate and

apart from an acquisition?
MRo VANDERSTARs

Oh, it's separate and apart from,

or else there wouldn't be a need for two different clauses,
QUESTION? But there must a proposed acquisition,
at least, in both cases?
MRo VANDERSTARs

Yes, that's right.

38

QUESTIONS Well# no, your point is that the acquisi­
tion can't have occurred in the past,
MR. VANDERSTAR:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, yes.

There has to be an —

Therefore it’s not a proposed acquisition,

it's an acquisition that occurred historically, —
MR. VANDERSTAR:
QUESTION:

Well, proposed, not actual —

— and therefore the acquiring agency

has ownership or occupancy of the premises, and now gives a
written order*
MR. VANDERSTAR:
QUESTION:

That's your position,

MR0 VANDERSTAR:
QUESTION:

That's right.

That's exactly right.

You mean that if HUD acquired property

in 1957, that would qualify it as an acquiring agency, and
then if it gives notice to vacate in 1977, it comes under the
written order clause?
QUESTION:

Yes„

MR. VANDERSTAR:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Congress said so.

That’s exactly his submission.

MR. VANDERSTAR:

Congress said so in Section 2.19,

which
is not codified, it’s the so-called Murrey Hill section*
>
that was designed at the urging of then Representative now
Mayor Koch of New YorH, to cover a situation in“which it was
expected that people would be displaced before the Act became
effective, and clearly they would not be covered.

39

QUESTIONS

Was that relied on by the lower court?

That section»
MR. VANDERSTARs

I believe it was referred to, ye3.

QUESTIONS Was it relied on?
MR0 VANDERSTARs
positive of that.

Yes, I think so, but I’m not

The two lower courts came out in opposite

directions.
QUESTIONS

But the Court of Appeals for the District

of Columbia Circuit did?
MR. VANDERSTARs

I can't ba certain of that.

QUESTION! Can I ask you again, I thought originally
you told me that the acquisition clause and the written notice
clause were separate animals?
QUESTION?

Yes.

MR. VANDERSTARs
QUESTIONS

But now you're saying they are the same.

MR. VANDERSTARs
QUESTIONS

Yes, they are.

No, sir.

No, sir.

I’m saying

You said that if the property was acquired

in 1950, that was acquired, that's enough to apply to a 1977
notice,
MR, VANDERSTARs

If there's a written order to vacate

in 1977 that otherwise meets the statutory language, the fact
that the acquisition occurred 20 years earlier is irrelevant,
QUESTION?

Well, it'd be awfully hard to get any

eminent domain 20 years later, isn't it?

Wouldn’t it be?

40

MR. VANDERSTARs

That's right,

That's right.

That's why I say this is not an eminent domain statute, this
is a statute that focuses on displacement,
QUESTIONS Well, what is it if it's not eminent
domain?
MR, VAN DE RS TAR s

St's a displacement statute.

It's

a statute that —
QUESTIONS

A displacement at any time?

MR, VANDERSTARs
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.

So you don't need the acquisition in

there at all,
MR, VANDERSTAR?

Well, you n€ied to have had an

acquisition at some point in the past »—
QUESTION?

Mo, I mean if you're talking about

federal property, it would have had to be acquired. So why
have they got acquisition in there at all, under your theory?
MR. VANDERSTARs

I don't think the acquisition is

very important, but it is in the statute and I think wa meet
it in the facts of this case,
QUESTIONs

Well, the whole statute was based on that,

the whole statute was based on acquisition,
QUESTIONS The order has to come from the agency that
acquired the property — doesn't it?

Under the clear terms

of the statute,
MR. VANDERSTARs

Yss.

Yes, that's right.

41
QUESTIONs

From the acquiring agency.

MR. VANDERSTARs

Yes, that's right.

So if an agency

key and crucial in that sense.

QUESTION s
QUESTIONS

Yes.
Well, every owner is an acquiring agency

MR. VANDERSTARs

That's right.

QUESTION: Because it had to acquire it at some point.
MR. VANDERSTARs

That's right.

That's simply meant

to identify

So the word "acquiring" really just adds

nothing to the statute.
MR. VANDERSTARs

Except that it identifies which

agency issues —

MR. VANDERSTARs

It could have said "owning agency",

agency that —

I know, but what if it were the United

MRo VANDERSTARs
QUESTION?

I suppose so.

So anybody who is displaced from any

property that the United States or any of its agencies owns
is covered by this statute?
MRe VANDERSTARs

If it's for a program or project,

yes, sir.
QUESTION s

So the way for the acquiring agency to

get out of this, if you're correct, is to convey it to a
private person, and then have him issue the notice?
MR. VANDERSTARs
QUESTION?

That might be a v;ay out.

One other way is not to acquire»

[Laughter.j
MR. VANDERSTARs
QUESTIONS

Or not to displace the area.

Could I ask you one more question?

Do you understand the United States position hare to be
similar or close to the positions taken by the courts that
have held contrary to the District of Columbia?
MR. VANDERSTARs

The United States position — the

Seventh Circuit opinion is a little bit unclear.
