MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

W© will hear arguments

first this morning in 78-437,* Califano against Westcott and the
consolidated case*
Mr„ Alsupj, you may proceed whenever you are ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H0 A Li UP, ES-Q * ,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT IN NO. 78-437
MR* ALtoUP:

Mr* Chief Justice» and may it pleas© the

Court:
This is a direct appeal from the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts*

The District Court held

unconstitutional Section 407 of the Social Security Act*
&.

That's

provision which extends aid to families with dependent children

to two-parent families whose father is unemployed*
The District Court held the provision unconstitutional
1:©cause it does not likewise extend such aid to similarly situ­
ated families whose mothers are unemployed*
The Secretary of HEW appeals the holding that that
section is unconstitutional*

John Pratt» Commissioner of Public

Welfare» in a consolidated appeal» appeals only from the reme­
dies selected by the District Court*
The Aid to Families with Dependent .Children provides
financial assistance to families of needy children* .It is a
program under which if a state elects to participate and submits
a plan which complies with Section 402 of the,Social Security

4
Acti, the Federal Government will participate in funding of the
program*
Originally* the program was limited to needy children
who were deprived of parental »=> the support of a parent by virtue
of the absence from the home of the parent* or a pa rant * or the
death of a parent* or the incapacity of a parent»

Principally*

this was limited to single»parent families *
Later* an adjunct program* that is the program we are
concerned with today* was added.

That program extended AFDC

benefits to two-parent families where there was an unemployed
father *
Now* that program, appears in Section 407 of the Social
Security Act*

It is 42 U.S.C. 706 -- Sorry <=» 607»

In order

for a two-parent family to qualify under that provision* the
family must show that the father has a minimum but recent con­
nection with the employment market and that he is unemployed.
The Act does not require that the mother be in the
labor market* nor does it require that she be unemployed* or that
she be employedc

In fact* she may be employed and the only ef­

fect of her earnings is to reduce the amount of benefits that
are paid to the family.
In this case* the Appellees are two families which
did not qualify because the fathers lacked the requisite employ­
ment history.

The Act* as mentioned* requires that there b@

some recant* but minimal* connection with the labor market.

5
QUESTION:

In both cases * the mothers in the Appellee

families would have qualified under the statute had they been
fathers instead of mothersi is that right?
MR. AISUP:

That’s correct.
*

The fathers did not qualify because the Act requires
that within one year prior to the date of application the father
have been employed# that is earned at least $50 in six out of the
preceding thirteen quarter’s.

Or it counts in addition to earning

the $50 per quarter if the father had been enrolled in a training
program# that would have counted toward the six out of thirteen
quarters.
As mentioned# neither Mr. Westcott nor Mr. Westwood
satisfied this prerequisite.

And# as Justice Stewart points out#

in both cases the mothers did satisfy that requirement and they
were unemployed.

Accordingly# they were denied benefits under

the program.
These two families then brought this action in the
District Court.

On summary judgment# the court held that the

program was unconstitutional# either under the rational basis
test or under the substantial connection test.
QUESTION;• Under what provision of the Constitution?
MR. ALSUP:

Under the -Cue Process Clause of the Fifth

Amendment and the equal protection component of the Due Process -«■
QUESTION;
gender?

Because it discriminated on the basis of

6
MR* ALSUP:

Right.

The Iisfcrict Courts in fact, sustained that claim.

The

district Court reasoned that there were only two purposes that
could he imagined for such a program.

One was to assist needy

children of families which were impacted adversely by unemploy­
ment.
Secondly* the Court said the unemployed fathers program,
had been designed to remedy a structural flaw in the basic AFDC
program which had encouraged unemployed fathers to desert in
order that their remaining family could qualify for benefits.
QUESTION:
MR. ALSUPs

Mr. Alsup* is "impact" a verb?
It has been recently.

I'll remodify that

families adversely affected by unemployment.
Well* the District Court reasoned that with respect to
the first of those two objectives* that Is to assist families
adversely affected by unemployment.

It dldnst make any differ­

ence whether it was the woman or the man who had been discharged
or lost employment* that both families were just as needy.
I should say* by the way* that the Government does not
disagree with that part of the analysis of the District Court.
Our disagreement concerns the second goal of the statute.

That*

again* is to remedy a structural flaw in the basic AFDC program
that had created an incentive for an unemployed father to leave
home so that the mother and child* or other children* could
qualify.

7
Some reports, of the Secretary or a congressional com­
mittee indicated that that was rather pervasive* did it not?
MR0 ALSUP:

Yes* Your Honor»

In fact* I would like*

because that has become such an important issue in this case*
X would like to spend a fair part of my argument time going over
some of that legislative history.

But I think you are absolutely

correct that was a predominant goal in both 1961., 1962 and 1967
when this program took final shape.
With respect to that goal* though* the District Court
said that the program might go to a «- part of the way towards
eliminating the incentive to desert* but there was still an in»
centive to desert in exactly the ease before the Court* because
the mother had lost her job and therefore the family needed in­
come and the father* though he had not been connected with the
labor market within the meaning of the Act* nonetheless might
leave home in order to qualify the family.
Therefore* the court said the statute did not go as
far as necessary to remedy the desertion problem* and in fact
thwarted the desertion remedy intended by Congress.

Therefore*

it did not satisfy the substantial connection test nor the
rational basis test.
Now* our appeal here is a narrow one.

As I mentioned*

we do not — In fact*, we agree that if the sole purpose of the
unemployed fathers program had been to provide relief to needy
families hurt by unemployment* that it would be unconstitutional

8
to limit the benefits based upon a stereotypical assumption that
working mothers' .incomes are less important than working fathers1
inc om.es,
We disagree.* howevers with the District Court's refusal
to sustain the program as substantially related to the purpose to
remove or mitigate that incentive for fathers to desert that x*jas
existent and identified under the prior program,,
Let's consider that latter point for a moment.
AFCC program began in 1935»

The

As President Roosevelt said at the

time he proposed it. the core of the program was to provide aid
to children.
There were two basic principles involved.

First, fch©

President and Congress reasoned that needy children with two
ablebodied parents would be assisted by general work relief
program and unemployment compensation.

Therefore* there was

no special need in that program for them.
However, second* children with only a single parent
would not be assisted by such general work relief because* as
was all too common in that clay* such a parent would be unable
to accept employment without placing the child in an institution.
Now* it was in order to avoid breaking up the home
where there was a single parent* that Congress originally enacted
the AFDG program* so as to give that parent a choice to be able
to stay home and take care of the child in the event there was
only a single parent.

And that applied whether there was a

9
father or a mother.
Now* over the years* it became generally accepted and
Congress so found in 1961* *62 and "67* that rather than* quote*
"maintaining and strengthening family life*" as Section 401 pro­
claims its goal to be* the ARDC program* in fact* had a very per­
verse effect of breaking up homes.
President Kennedy said in his first State of the Union
address* "To many fathers* unable to support their families* have
resorted to real or pretended desertion in order to qualify their
children for help,"
So the President asked Congress to pass what was then
called an Unemployed Parents Program,

That program provided aid

both to unemployed fathers and unemployed mothers.

But one of

the predominant reasons behind that »QUESTION:

Let me have that again.

MR, ALSUP:

Aid to the family --

QUESTION:

Aid to them?

Not to the unemployed mother or father- but

for the benefit of the family unit?
MR, ALSUP:
I misspoke.

You are absolutely correct. Your Honor,

It is important to emphasize that this is aid to

families and not to any particular individuals within that
family.

The whole program is designed for families with children,
Now* two reasons were given by the Administration and

throughout the legislative history for enacting the program in
1961,

First* the country was in a recession.

An extension of

10

AFDC fco families that were hurt by unemployment was a form of
temporary unemployment relief.
Eecond, however,, Congress did want to reduce or miti~
gate the incentive for fathers to desert, which had been caused,
since 1935^ by the basic AFDC program itself„
Now, even though we are concerned principally with the
1967 change* this legislative history in 1961 and 2962 is very
pertinent because it reflects and illuminates congressional intent
in dealing with this problem over the years.
Secretary RIbicoff appeared as the lead off witness -or the second witness behind Secretary Goldberg.

He said, "This

bill would eliminate one of .the major concerns expressed through
the years about Aid fco Dependent Children, namely that unemployed
fathers are forced to desert their families in order that their
families may receive aid."'
He presented convincing evidence of this.

He showed

that there was an overwhelming percentage of cases in which
there was no father in the home.
show this.

In fact, the 1958 statistics

In only 1$ of the AFDC cases, 1$, was there just a

father in the home with the children.

In 70$ of the cases, theri'

was a mother in the home with the children, but no father.
QUESTION:
MR. AISUP:

How about the other 29$ ?
In 195$£bofch were present.

In 10$, both

had deserted, or neither was present.
QUESTION:

I thought the program, up until than, was

11

applicable only to families in which there was one parent» only
one parent.
MR. AL5UP:
incapacity point.

That's principally correct» except for the

If a parent is incapacitated» if they are not

ablebodied and» therefore» they were able to qualify. As a prac­
tical matter» most of the families were single-parent families.
But an exception was made when -QUESTION:

Some 29# of the total were not one-parent

families.
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

No» 19.5# were —
70# were no father» 1# were no mother.

That

leaves 29#.
MR. AiisUP:

And 10# of those were neither.

That means

that the children were living with relatives and not with the
pa rents.
QUESTION:
MR. AL3UP:

With ersatz family» with kinfolk.
Correct.

QUESTION:

Or in foster homes?

QUESTION:

It wouldn't apply in foster homes» woult it?

MR, ALSUP:

Not to a foster home.

parents or uncles or aunts,

Usually the grand­

Foster homes came in later» in a

later amendment.
MR, ALSUP:

So» again» it was 1# father only» 70#

mother only» 19|# both and 10# neither.
Now» 18# of all those cases was a case in which the

12

father had deserted»
died or divorced»

And by desert* I don't mean that they had

There was another category for those,

This

18# were people who literally deserted their families.
Now* there was no evidence that there was a problem
with maternal desertion.

The statistics that were presented »

showed that the number of cases in which a mother had deserted
from a iwo»parent family* at most* could be 1,8#,

That 1,8#

alec included departures due to death or incapacity or divorce.
So* although we can't give you the exact breakdown within that
1,8#* we know that the number of maternal desertions was quite
small.
So* here we have a problem of masses of fathers deserting in order* at least in some cases* to qualify for bene­
fits* virtually no mothers doing the same,
QUESTION:

Mr, Alsup* could I ask one question about

the facts of this case?
If the fathers*in this case* of both families should
desert* would the families then become eligible?
MR, ALSUP,

That is correct.

Now* Representative McCormack
QUESTION:

Under the original concept, the families

would then become eligible* wouldn't they?
MR* Ai&UP;

That's correct.

Under the original

program,
I don't believe that's happened in this case* but you

13

are correct.
QUESTION:

To the extent you are emphasizing the desire

to prevent a paternal desertion from qualifying a family, the
statute really doesn't accomplish anything in this particular
case* does it? Bacause the incentive is still there.
MR„ ALSUP:

That's correct.

Congress did not remedy

this precise situation in the 1967 amendment.
Now* for example* on the House floor in 1961*
Representative McCormack said about this very provisions "It is
my considered opinion* which is shared by many social welfare
leaders* that these restrictions" — referring to the previous
program — "have contributed to advance instability and synthetic
desertions when such desertions represented the father's only
means of getting adequate financial protection for his minor
children."
That has been cited in the briefs* but because it is
in a footnote* let me draw the Court’s attention to that.

That's

107* Congressional Record 3768,
We've cited other passages similar to that in our brief,
fhe program was passed.

It was optional only with the states*

Just the Unemployed Parent Program* and twelve states quickly
:

adopted it* but the program ran out a year later.
Secretary Rifoicoff came back to Congress and success­
fully obtained another extension of the same program.

He sub­

mitted a report during the Senate hearings on the bill, which

14

showed that in fact it had accomplished the purpose* in part*
of preventing family breakups*

He said that one of the most

significant services which the A.OCUP program offered to recip»
Lent families was,, quotes "the prevention of family breakups*"
Assistant Secretary Wilbur Cohen also testified*

One

of the reasons why the recommendation was made was to provide
assistance where there was unemployment* so as not to encourage
men to leave their homes in order to make their families eligible*
That appears at page 154 of the Senate hearings.
Then Representative Kehoe said* concerning the exten­
sions, "It seems to us last year* before the provision was first
added* that Congress was saying this to the unemployed father;
8If you stay with your family and try to hold it together during
this critical period* we can offer you no federal assistance.
But if you happen to desert them* your family will be fully
eligible for aid to dependent children,"
He continued* "This seemed then and it seems to us
now an anomalous and indefensible situation.

Moreover* there

is evidence which indicates that this new program lias already
had the effect of returning fathers to their families."

"A study*"

he said* "conducted by HEW for the first seven months of the
program's operations, shows that of the 66*100 applications
allowed at that time* 2*900 families which had been receiving
aid to dependent children for reasons other than unemployment
became eligible under the new program* usually because an absent

15
father had returned to the home*"
Now* in 1967* Congress restricted the program to un­
employed fathers only.

The recession had passed at that time

and the principal objective in 1967 in restricting it only to
unemployed fathers* was that Congress had intended to remedy the
structural incentive built into the original program for fathers
to desert,
I"11 only burden you with one quotation from the
Senate report in 1967»

They said* "The Committee is concerned

about the effect that the absence of a state program has on
family stability.

Where there is no such program"--

Let me

pause here.
There were only twenty*» two states* at that time* which
.

had adopted the program.

..

v •

-v ■'

"

‘ '<

Congress was concerned that the other

28 had not yet adopted it.
— "Where there is no such program* there is no incentive for an unemployed father to desert his family in order
to make him eligible for assistance.

This will be a matter of

continuing study by the Committee.
"This program was originally conceived by Congress as
one to provide aid to the children of unemployed fathers.

How­

ever* some states make families in which the father is working
but the mother unemployed eligible for assistance.
would not allow such situations,"
Thank you

QUESTIONj

Mr. Alsup* could I ask you a question?

The District Court did certify this case as a class
action., did it not?
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Correct.
And it defined the class as all Massachusetts

families who would be eligible for the AFDCUP* and therefore
medicaid benefits* except for their requirement in 407 that the
unemployed parent be a father?
MR. ALSUP

I believe that's correct.

QUESTION;

So the relief it granted and its decision

really went far beyond the facts of this particular ease,, did it
not?
MR. ALSUP:

That's correct* in this sense.

The facts

of this case are that the fathers did not even meet the con­
nection with the employment market test of the six out of the
thirteen quarters.
The relief afforded by the District Court would also
provide relief in the case where the father actually is employed»
but the mother becomes unemployed.

And* therefore* because they

are below the standard of need* they are eligible for assistance.
So you are correct the relief* I believe* does extend
beyond the facts of this individual case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Alsup* your opponent6® brief says that

the Task Force on Sex Discrimination of the Civil Rights Division
last October made* in its report to the President* a flat statement

17

that the statute overtly and substantively discriminated against
women,
- o you have any comment about that?
MR, AL3UP;

Yes9 the — I've looked at that provision

of the Task Force report.

It's about a page and a half in the

context of a much longer report concerning discrminafcion against
women in Federal legislation.

That report does not purport to

have any exhaustive analysis of the legislative history.
there is no analysis of the legislative history,

In fact»,

And* on its.

face-s this does appear to be some sort of curious sex discrimina­
tion,

But once you get into the legislative history and you see

that there was a very permissible purpose that Congress had in
mind* and that this is substantially related to curing that
problem., then you see that it is not a suspect or unconstitutional
classification.
The Task Force did not address itself to that legis­
lative history, so we disagree with the analysis of that report
and believe that had they considered the legislative history that
we have now looked at they might agree with us,
QUE^TIGM:

Does the Department of Justice assume any

responsibility for what the Task Force said?
MR, ALSUP:

Of course,» the Solicitor General speaks

Tor the United States and the Department of Justice before this
Court with respect to what our legal positions are.

So* to that

extentthe Solicitor General has disapproved the report of the

18

Task Force*

I am an Assistant Attorney

Court's remedy the defect which it found in Section 407»

This

appeal raises a fundamental question concerning the balance to

tion of powers principle»
The District Court elected to extend «section 407 under
inclusive class in order to salvage AFLC-UP program.

While this

decision to extend the class was correct* the District Court ex=tended the class too far*

The District Court rewrote Section

407 such that the unemployment of either parent would qualify
the family for benefits* even though the family's principle wage
earner was still employed.

Under this remedy* a parent who had

been only a casual member of the labor force could trigger ben®“
fits by his or her unemployment,

Y0s, Your Honor, it would.

And save you some money?

MR. JOHNS®:

It would be a less expensive program,

QUESTION:

Isn’t that correct?
MR, JOHNS®:
QUESTION:

Yes* Your Honor.

So* the District Court did no more than I

suggested; is that correct?
MR, JOHNSON:
QUESTI®:

You are quite correct* Your Honor.

And it found it invalid insofar as it dis»

21

that what it -did?

MR. JOHNSON;

But Congress has always meant the AFPC-

UP program»
QUESTION;

Congress also in 1967 enacted a law that

said these A EEC payments shall be made only when the father is
unemployed

s

but that was held unconstitutional.

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes* Your Honor.

But in order to fashion

a remedy that stays true to congressional intent —
QUESTION:

If we stayed true to congressional intent®

we would reverse the District Court's judgment® holding that the
intent of Congress was unconstitutional® wouldn't wa?
MR. JOHNSON:

But the remedy of .extension finds its

fountain of justification in what Congress would have done if it
had known that the program® as written® was incorrect.

What

Congress meant to do® at bottom® was to establish a program for
lamilles whose principle wage earner had b@«n knocked out of the

22
labor market.
Congress traditionally assumed that that principle wage
earner was the father.
QUESTION:

But* in fact, under the — assuming the

validity of the present program* if the principle wage earner
was* in fact* the mother* nonetheless AFDC payments are payable
if the father is unemployed.
MR. JOHNSON:

Isn't that right?

That practice has been tolerated by

Congress
QUESTION:

Isn't that true* under feh@ statute?

Not

the practice being tolerated*, isn't that what the statute pro­
vides?
MR. JOHNSON:

The statute simply says the father's

unemployment.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. JOHNSON:

But the legislative reports in 1967*

when that term came in,, specifically said the reason for this
was because states had abused the term "parent," by providing
benefits to families where the mothers were unemployed* even
though that principle wage earner «*» presumed principle wage
tarnier -» the father* was still working.
Congress specifically reacted to that syndrome of
allowing a secondary wage earner to trigger benefits by unemploy­
ment.

That* I think* when you strip away the sex characteristics

that Congress used to define these economic terms* is the

23

underlying intent of Congress*
If you consider a program that provides benefits when
a secondary3 or even casual wage earnier is knocked out of the
labor market* that is a great step forward from the limited goal
which Congress sought in 1961* *62 and ‘67* to achieve* which was
simply to help families whose principle wage earner* their economic mainstay* had been knocked out of that employment market.
QUiiSTIQN:

.some of your arguments make me wonder why

you did not appeal on the constitutional questions* instead of
just on the remedy.
MR. JOHN&ON:

Your Honor* I think that may highlight

the fact that the Commissioner differs tremendously with the
.secretary and the Solicitor General on his reading of legislative
history.

The Solicitor General has retreated to the concept that

the only purpose of AFDC-UP was to keep fathers from leaving the
home* a prophylactic against a defect in the AFDC program.
QUESTION:

The simulated desertions* the synthetic*

as they were called.
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes* Your Honor.

But we'say the funda­

mental reason the Congress enacted this program -- and my brief
bears this out in terms of legislative history -- was to get
benefits out to families whose principal wage earnier had been
laid off.
When President Kennedy came into office in 1961* he
found a tremendous recession and instituted two major programs

24

right off the bat, to extend unemployment compensation and to
provide benefits to wage earnier who couldn't find jobs.
concept was one of equality of treatment.

The

Why should a child

whose father sits at home because his employer is shut down be
any less needy, any less worthy of benefit than a child whose
father has simply walked out the door?

The idea was to take care

of children whose wage earners had been let down by the economy.
This was what AFDCU was generated to do.
In short, the District Court's remedy has two flaws,
As a constitutional matter, it oversteps the limits which Congress
set for the AFDCU program.

As a matter of equity, its remedy

exceeds the scope of the constitutional ivrong which it would
remedy.
A principal wage earner remedy, that advocated by the
Commission, would assist every family whose principal wage earner,
whether male or female, is unemployed.

That is a complete remedy

and it more accurately preserves the congressional conception of
the AFDCU program, which I have discussed with Mr. Justice
.Stewart and Mr. Chief Justice Burger,
The Secretary in his brief now attempts to buttress the
District Court's remedy from another direction.

He asserts that

his power to define unemployment bars this Court from adopting
the principal wage earner ..-remedy, even if that remedy more
accurately reflects the intent of Congress.

The Secretary's

argument misreads Section 4o? and must be rejected.

25

Turning first to legislative history. — and quite
brieflyj, because I have discussed it

the key, in the Commis»

sioner's eye, to this case, is what Congress meant when it se­
lected the father as the parent who must be unemployed *

Congress

identified the principal wage earners-whose unemployment ‘would
impoverish their families, as fathers.

Purged of this sex bias,

only the legislative focus upon the family's principal wage
earner remains,

Substitution of the term "principal wage earner*

with the term "father" would preserve the legislative purpose to
assist those families whose true breadwinners were unemployed,
no more and no less.
Turning to the Secretary's argument, the plain language
of Section 407 rebuts the Secretary's assertion that only he has
the power to adopt the principal wage earner remedy»

The Secre­

tary now points to his exclusive discretion under Section 407
to define unemployment»

Section 407 defines an eligible family

These two terms express very differant concepts»

Unemployment is a relative notion subject to empirical defini­
tion, a definition appropriately left to administrative discre­
tion on an ongoing basis*

26

Congress' choice of the term "father*" on the other
hand* represents a policy judgment as to which families should be
entitled to benefits*

The Commissioner argues those families

whose principal wage earner has been knocked out of the labor
force*
In order to reaffirm the limits on the judicial ability
to rewrite legislation* this Court should reverse the remedy
ordered by the District Court and put the principal wage earner
remedy in its stead*
Thank you* very much,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well* Mr, Johnson,

Mr, Freedman,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY A, FREEDMAN* £BQ„*
ON BEHALF OF APPELL&Eo IN BOTH CAjES
MR, FREEDMAN:

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
Under Section 407 of the Social Security Act* Appellees
are denied desperately needed cash and medical benefits for one
reason and one reason only.

The parent of the family whose un­

employment caused the destitution is female.

These families are

just as needy as those who receive benefits.

The female parent

has just as extensive a work history and is as willing to comply
with work requirements as the male parent whose unemployment
qualifies the family for benefits.
The problem with Appellee families* apparently* is that

27

the mother* for reasons of circumstance or of choice* 'does not
conform fco traditional stereotypes and is or has bean a family
breadwinner.

But only traditional* that is male* breadwinners

can qualify a family for AFOC benefits.

The gender discrimination

that we have in this case is more onerous than that which this
Court has encountered in any prior gender discrimination case.
It is because of a combination at i^ork here.
First* subsistence benefits* benefits needed for
survival are being denied.

And secondly* the Act imposes an

absolute bar fco receipt of those benefits* rather than simply
applying a further test under which a showing must be mad©* such
as a tesfc of dependency.
.Since there is gender discrimination in this case* the
test to be applied* as this Court most recently reiterated In
Dry v„ Qrr last month* is that the gender classification must
serve important governmental objectives and be substantially
related fco the achievement of those objectives.
QUESTION:

Qrr v. Qrr was not a. case involving govern^

mental largess.
MR. FREEDMAN:

That is correct* Your Honor.

That was

a case involving a claim between parties.
QUESTION:

In any event* it was limited -- what that

did was limit fche discretion of a divorce court judge.

Mo matter

whafc the situation was he was simply not -- prohibited from ever
awarding alimony in favor of a husband against a wife* but that

28

involved private property.

This involves government largess,

;=nd our opinions in that area have a somewhat different cast*
don't they?
MR. FREEDMAN:

While there might be somewhat more

division* it is still clear that the Orr decision was applying
the test that had previously been applied by this Court in
a Ufano y, Webster* Califano v, Goldfarb* cases involving the
social security Act*

So Government benefits have been tested

under the same standard by this Court.
In seeking to avoid the effect of this test* however*
the .solicitor General* particularly in his brief* has argued that
there was one objective* really* and one objective only for the
AFDCU program* and that was to encourage fathers* not parents*
not the father or the mother* but just the father* to remain in
the home.
But* as the state has also argued* the overriding
objective of the AFDCU program* throughout its history* has been
to meet needs of children caused by unemployment of the parent.
And that objective is* of course* totally unserved by the gender
classification at issue.
QUESTION:

does your-argument boil down at all to at

what point you slice'dels thing* so to speak?

Do you determine

intent as of 1935 or as of 1967?
MR. FREEDMAN:

For purposes of this case* we would argue

it doesn't matter as of what year you determine it.

There were

29

really two years here where decisions were made with regard to
fche AFDCU program.

The first was in 1961 when the program was

created and fciren it was clearly sex neutral.

If no change had

been made in 1967* the Wesfccofcfc family and the Westwood family
would have qualified for benefits.
do what we have here is a cutback made in 1967«
QUESTION:

But I thought you were arguing it's the

overall purpose of the AFDC program* which I understand was
adopted in 1935?
MR. FREEDMAN:

That is correct.

The AFDCU program is

a subprogram* clearly a subprogram of AFDC.
to meet the needs of dependent children.

AFDC was designed

AFDCU was added in

1961 to expand the class of dependent children whose needs were
going to be met by the program* namely to include the children
of the unemployed.

And that definition of a dependent child has

been maintained in the AFajCU program until the state

The de­

pendent child, a child qualifying for benefits of the program*
is a child deprived of parental support or care by reason of fche
unemployment.

And the word that was changed in 1967 was "un­

employment of a father" instead of "unemployment of a parent."
But clearly*, the purpose reflected by that statutory
language* and by fche legislative history throughout* was to meet
a need caused by unemployment,

Indeed* in 1967* former HEW

Secretary Ribieoff* now Senator Ribicoff* has stated that a child
can be just as hungry if a parent is unemployed* as if a parent

30

Is dead, absent or incapacitated.
Indeed* nowhere in the legislative history is there any
statement or any reflection that the fundamental purpose of the
AFDG program to meet needs was being rejected or abandoned or
even diminished by Congress.
QUESTION:

But in fact it was.

MR. FREEDMAN:

Indeed it was.

Nowhere did Congress say. "We are cutting back on the
program because we believe there are needy children whose needs
we don't want to meet."
QUESTION:

But Congress did cut back on the program*

evidently* or you wouldn't be here.
MR. FREEDMAN:

That's correct.

And what we are trying

to discern is why did Congress cut back on the program.
QUESTION:

As a representative of the people of the

United States* it did.
MR. FREEDMAN:

It had power to act.

The question is

why did it act?
Under the test that we are applying today* the Court
has set out for itself the task of determining what was the actual
purpose of the gender classification.
QUESTION:

Are you telling us that there is something

that this Court knows that Congress didn't know aboutvhafe its

purpose was in 1967?
MR. FREEDMAN:

Not at all.

What this Court has to do

31

is fco read the Act* which tells it that the purpose is to aid
dependent children»

And then look at the legislative history

and attempt to discern why was it that Congress made the change
that it did in 1967# and then does the gender classification sub»
stantially serve that purpose?
And when we look at the legislative history in 1967,
as I was saying# we find no indication that there was desire to
move away from the needs-meeting purpose and move# as the
Solicitor General argues# to an anti-paternal desertion purpose»
What we do find is that the debate was pervaded by
sax stereotyping»

The words "father" and ''parent" were used

interchangeably# without any indication or sense that something
different was being said,
QUESTION:

Well# what do you say the purpose of

Congress in 1967 was# when it enacted this# as reflected in the
legislative history?
MR, FREEDMAN:

We would say that the purpose of the

introduction of the gender classification was consistent with the
general concern that Congress had in 1967 with regard to the
AFDCU program# that some states were qualifying families for
benefits on the basis of the so-called unemployment of a family
member they assumed to be the homemaker# the housewife# when that
person really had no prior attachment to the work force and was
not the type of person whom Congress saw as unemployed who was
losing income and therefore someone who created a need that Congress

32

wished to meet*
Congress addressed this in several ways.

It addressed

it by adding a primary attachment to the work force test.

But it

would seem that in terms of the stereotypical thinkings, that the
real wage earner in a family is the father and that the mother
is basically the person who stays at home.

The way of nailing

down that decision was to deny aid where there was an unemployed
mother»
Now., we don't really know* because the problem we have
here is that the legislative history ie generally so uninformative.
But what we do know is that no one claimed that the purpose was
being changed* no one attached real significance to this change.
Rather* they spoke in terms of the types of stereotypes which
this Court has consistently rejected* such as -QUESTION:

Are you saying that where the legislative

history is not clear you are not free to look at the language
of the statute itself?
MR» FREEDMAN:

Not in the least.

Our argument is that

the language of the statute demonstrates concern about need caused
by deprivation»

I mean the Solicitor General is arguing that

the purpose here was to deter desertion.

And we look at the

language of the statute and nowhere do we see any discussion of
that»

That is why we suggest that it is valid to look at the

legislative history.
QUESTION:

Do you have difficulty finding that concept

33
in the legislative history?
MR» FREEDMAN:
QUESTION:

The deterrence of desertion?

Yes.

MR. FREEDMAN: Not at all.

We find it quite easy to

find it in the legislative history, with regard to other sections
of the AFBC program, which were enacted to address the question
of desertion.

In fact, in taking the action that Congress took

in the Social Security Amendments of 1967, the bill that we are
addressing here today, both committee reports had a heading, one
heading that said, "AFDCU program," and another heading that
said, "Desertion»"

And under the heading Desertion, two pro­

visions were discussed.

One, to strengthen the child-support

program, under which states would identify and pursue absent
parents for child support,

And the other to impose a so-called

AFDC freeze, under which federal reimbursement to the states -there would be a cap on federal reimbursements to the states for
absent parent cases, so that if the state's absent parent case­
load increased, there would be no further federal funding.
Congress made it clear that the reason for this was to
stir the states into action to do something about desertion, to
improve their family services, to strengthen their child support
program.

But in both of those instances in which Congress ex­

plicitly addressed the question of desertion, it did so clearly in
a sex-neutral manner, in terms of the legislation.

There is no

indication that it was less concerned about a mother deserting

34
a family than about a father deserting a family*

And* clearly*

if Congress had such an anti-desertion objective related to the
AFDCU program* it too would have been sex-neutral.

And* of course*

the gender discrimination would not bear a fair and substantial
relationship to such an objective.
The Solicitor General* it should be noted* has made no
attempt to defend the gender discrimination in this case on the
basis of a general congressional desire to maintain family
stability or to deter desertion,
Moreover* we would want to point out that the Solicitor
General* this morning* relied almost entirely upon the 1961 and
the 1962 history of the Act* when the Act was clearly sex-neutral,
QUESTION:

Suppose in 1961 -- Was this first adopted in

‘62?
MR. FREEDMAN:
QUESTION:

I96I.

Suppose it had been adopted in 1901 in the

‘67 form and it were perfectly clear from the legislative history*
which you dispute* that the reason they wanted to adopt it was
to obviate the desertion of the fathers.
Would you still argue that there was unconstitutional
gender discrimination?
MR, FREEDMAN:
at least two reasons.

We certainly would* Your Honor* for
One would be that if its concern was to

deter desertion of fathers* as Justice Stevens noted before* it
simply doesn't work that way.

Cases in which -» cases such as

35
Plaintiffs ‘ cases in ivhich it was the mother who became un­
employed* are still cases in which there — the father or the
mother -- as is the case when the father becomes unemployed
the father or the mother will be in a position where the family
can only qualify for benefits if one of the parents leaves home*
We should note* in response to the question before*
that* indeed* in this case* Billy Waste ott* although his land­
lord suggested that he leave home in order to qualify the family
for AElC benefits and then enable it to pay the landlord rent*

Rather* the family went without

QUESTION:

Well* it is true that up until 1961 if

two parents were in the home* even though the father became
unemployed* they were totally ineligible for AFDC payments.,
MR. FREEDMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Up until I96I* unemployment didn't have

anything to do with it* if both parents were there.

And* there­

fore* if an employed father became unemployed* prior to 1961*
there would be an incentive for him to leave home* so it would
be a single-parent family and they would be eligible.
MR. FREEDMAN:

There was an equivalent incentive for

From 1935 until the

36
QUESTION:

Up until 1961* a family was eligible only

if there was a single parent.

It was not eligible if both

parents were in the home* even though unemployed,
MR. FREEDMAN:

Unless one was incapacitated, of

course* as you pointed out before,
QUESTION:

And that was the problem to which Congress

was addressing itself* because prior to 1961 the regime provided
an incentive to a father who became unemployed to leave home so
his family would be eligible.
Am I quite wrong about that?
MR, FREEDMAN:

You are right that the eligibility was

based upon there being a parent absent,
QUESTION:

Away* physically gone,

MR, FREEDMAN:

That is correct.

We would not agree

that that was the problem that Congress was addressing in 1961.
We believe the legislative history shows that the overwhelming
problem that Congress was addressing in 1961 was that there were
needy two-parent families out there in this point of recession
who were not eligible for benefits and who desperately needed
benefits.

And the purpose of the program* as the legislative

history shows throughout* was to meet the needs of children.
It was also noted that this would have the desirable effect of
eliminating an incentive that was perceived in the existing
AFDC program.

There were those who argued in Congress that there

was no such incentive to desert* that* indeed, states had general

37
assistance programs which often provided for these families.
There were certainly the skeptics who said this was not the
purpose.

Everyone did agree that the purpose of the legisla­

tion, and the overwhelming purpose at least* was to meet needs*
was to provide for families who were otherwise not receiving
benefits or who were receiving inadequate benefits under state
plans or who had exhausted unemployment compensation.
QUESTION:

Are you telling us that this counterfit or

synthetic desertion pattern was not part of the motivation of
Congress?
MR. FREEDMAN:

We do not believe that the record shows

that the motivation of the committees who adopted this legisla­
tion that the Congress had adopted — that the motivation was
affected in any significant way by a concern about desertion*
real or synthetic.

But it clearly was discussed and certainly

our case doesn't turn upon rejecting that as a purpose.

Whereas,

the Solicitor General's case* at least the way the brief has
been presented, turns upon his establishing that there was no
purpose related to meeting needs.
It is our argument, however, that in 1967, when this
change was made, there is no reflection that Congress adopted
the gender discrimination because it was abandoning a funda­
mental needs-meeting purpose of the program.

And, moreover,

there is no indication that when it adopted this change
was related to the issue of desertion.

it

38
Once again* all of the discussion about desertion
comes essentially from two sources.
of the Act*that I referred to

One is the other provisions

that concern desertion* child

support program* the AFDC freeze* and so forth.

There* the

sponsors of the legislation* the committee chairmen* and so
forth* spoke in terms of desertion.

The other time desertion was

discussed was with regard to the APDCU program* and it was by
those upon whom the Solicitor General relies* who were those
who supported expansion of the program and who ultimately voted
against this bill that was adopted.

Those individuals said*

"We deed a mandatory AFDC program in every state to fight de­
sertion,"

And that was voted down by the Congress,
What the Congress supported was a bill presented by

Senator Long* by Congressman Mills* to which they attached no
significance.

They never even noted* on the House or Senate

floor* in presenting the bill* that a gender discrimination has
been introduced here.

It went entirely without notice,

Senator Long* in discussing the bill with other Sena­
tors referred interchangeably to the unemployed fathers and the
unemployed parent bill.

He didn't see it as significant*

apparently* and no one else called him on it* or said* "Why
are we changing this from unemployed parent to unemployed
father?"

The reason* we submit* is that they were thinking

consistently in terms of the types of stereotypes which this
Court has rejected* in Stanton* the assumption that men are going

39
to go out into the world of work, women will stay at home, the
archaic and over-broad generalizations in Wiesenfeld, that it is
only the male parent earnings that provide a significant source
of support to the family*
QUESTION;

Mr0 Freedman* isn't that somewhat incon­

sistent with your use of the word "archaic/’ if in your view
the Congress had used correct perceptions of male and female
roles in 1935 and 1961 and '62?

Isn't it a little ironic that

all of a sudden in E67# years after those dates;, it all of a
sudden reverted to what you describe as "archaic" notion?
MRo FREEDMAN;
explanation for it.

It certainly is, and ws really have no

It did happen*

It was not the law before*

The AEDC and AFDCU benefits were provided on a sex-neutral basis
and we have searched through the legislative history, as have
our opponents, and the best explanations have been offered* and
we believe the best explanation is they didn't even think about
it.

They slipped into seme format, we believe, because they

were, indeed, looking to a prior attachment to the work force
and assumed, looking into the question of employment, that women
did not contribute significantly to their families in the past.
QUESTION;

I think you said you understood the Solici­

tor General's argument to be entirely based upon this legislative
purpose with which you disagree.

It is true that he spent a

great, deal of time in oral argument this morning on that subject.
But, as I read the brief, the basic argument is that this is

40

simply not the kind of gender discrimination with which this
Court has previously dealt# because this deals with benefits to
families and the families might be all female# they might be all
girl children# and that the benefits that are payable or not
payable are not in any way discriminatory upon the basis of
gender# unlike our other cases to which you have just been
citing us*

QUESTI®:

I think they filed their brief here and I

don't think they have withdrawn any part of it.
MR. FREEDMAN:

Fine.

And our response to that is that

the benefits that are at issue in this case are benefits based
upon past employment.

on the basis of past employment and then denies them when the
person who was employed in the past is a woman* It Is clearly

that past employment of men qualifies a family for benefits and
that past employment of women does not,

It is present unemployment, isn't it?

MR, FREEDMAN:

But that is defined in terms of past

QUESTION:

It is present unemployment* that's the

test.
MR, FREEDMAN:

Yes,

And we would submit that that is no different from
the kinds of discrimination that this Court has found in many
previous cases.

In Goldfarb and Wiesenfeld* for example* the

Court found that there was discrimination against one particular
category of family* that in which the female spouse was the
wage earner.

And in Frontlero and in JabIon* the Court found --

But those were matters of compensation*

were they not?
MR. FREEDMAN:

pendent,

It was only if there was a de­

It was to a husband* wife* family that those benefits

were being provided* and they were provided to all families in
which the husband was the employee.

But they were not provided

to all families in which the woman was employee.

And they were

family benefits that were at issue in those cases.
We submit that there is clearly gender discrimination
involved in this case* and therefore it is unconstitutional.
In sum* then* with regard to the case on the merits*
it is our argument that the overriding purpose of the AFJCU
program is to meet the need of children caused by the unemploy­
ment of the parent and the denial on the basis of the sex of
that unemployed parent neither serves nor is related to impor­
tant governmental objectives.

The purpose for the gender clas­

sification was not to deter desertion, but rather that purpose
was served in sex-neutral terms.
And finally* the classification was based upon sex
stereotypes* upon archaic and over-broad generalizations about
the roles of men and women as breadwinners.

And I should also

note* although we have not discussed them* the roles of men and

44

women as family deserters# with the assumption that it is the
father who always deserts a family# despite the statistical
showing that there are more fathers than mothers who desert*
but still clearly desertion is something that might confront
either parent,
And this Court has never accepted sex stereotyping
simply on the basis that more of one sex than another sex might
engage in certain behavior# and therefore deny benefits to all
members of a sex because of the possible behavior of certain
members of a sex.
Accordingly# the decision on the merits should be
affirmed# and I will turn to the question of remedy raised in
this case solely by the State of Massachusetts.
I will first discuss for a moment the traditional
choice of remedy# the choice that has always confronted this
Court in the past# between invalidation of the program itself
or extension to the class that has been excluded.

In this case

the class of families with an unemployed mother# where the
family is denied benefits solely because the unemployed parent
was female and not male.
We raise this for a minute because the state's attack#
on extension# has included the argument that extension violates
the principle of separation of powers.
We will then turn to the restructuring primary wage
earnier remedy urged by the state.

45
Extension of benefits to the excluded class follows
the consistent line of this Court’s equal protection benefit
cases, including gender discrimination cases, and is clearly
correcto

Invalidation would cause the abrupt termination of

benefits to more than half a million needy children and their
parents, would disrupt the state and local treasuries involved.
Whereas, extension would continue benefits to those needy
families and also provide benefits to needy families in which
a mother —
QUESTION:

Do you have another case where a Federal

Court ordered a state to remedy an equal protection violation
one way or another?
MR» FREEDMAN:

Where a Federal Court ordered --

In all of the Social Security Act cases before this Court,
extension has been the remedy, and of course in the residency
cases, Shapiro v. Thompson, and so forth, involved state AFDC
and other public assistance programs

And the remedy there was

to extend to those who had less than a year's residence in a
state»
Again, in all of these programs, as we would point
out, there is an option to the state to participate in the
program or not.

Indeed, with regard to the AFDCU program,

there is an option to the state to participate in the AFDCU
program and still retain its participation in the basic AFDC
program®

So, the order of .extension here simply makes it

46

possible for the State of Massachusetts, and every other state,
to decide whether or not it wishes to participate in the ex»
tended program»

Whereas, invalidation would make it impossible

for any state, even if it wants to, to participate in the ex»
tended program»

And this Court had earlier received an amicus

brief from the State of Pennsylvania which indicated firmly that
it wanted an extended AFDC program*

It would be denied that

opportunity if invalidation —
QUESTION:

Denied that opportunity by whom, the

Pennsylvania Legislature?
MR, FREEDMAN:

No, no.

If the Court's order were to

invalidate the AFDCU program, the state then could only provide
benefits to families of the unemployed by using its own money
entirely.

It would be denied the opportunity to request federal

reimbursement, in effect,

I mean that’s what’s at issue here,

in terms of invalidation or extension.
And that is clearly why invalidation is simply not
adopted in benefit cases, because of the problems it would
present.
QUESTION:

Why doesn’t the state, then, invariably

want the broadest possible option in terms of Invalidation,
if it is just a question of how much extra federal money that
the state can pick up?
MR, FREEDMAN;

Well, the argument here is that the

State of Massachusetts, apparently, would like to get some

47
federal matching

for certain families, but not for others.

So it is taking the occasion of this case to do, in effect,
what 1 believe Mr* Justice Stewart was suggesting before, to
try to redefine the terms in the Act, not really as a matter
of extension or invalidation, extension to the excluded class*
Clearly extension to the excluded class here means picking up
the families who would be eligible, but for the sex of the un­
employed parent*

And there is really not much complication

here.
Rather, what the State of Masschusetts has said is
that while we are at it why don't we redesign this program the
way we in 1979 would really like to see it.

And that's by having

a primary wage earner test.
And what the State, in effect, is doing is arguing
that as a matter of statutory construction is, indeed, perhaps
a way of avoiding the constitutional issue.
The Court could say that looking at the legislative
history Congress in 1967 said "father," but really meant pri­
mary wage earner.
The problem is that would clearly fail as a matter
of statutory construction.

Congress said "father," Congress

meant father, Congress never said "primary wage earner," never
even used the tern.
So, instead, what we have here is a state seeking —
QUESTION:

But you said the judge may add father and

48

mother.

Congress clearly meant father, hut you say the judge

can order those words — that word to mean "father and mother."
MR0 FREEDMAN:

That is extending the benefits to the

class that has been excluded.
QUESTION:

All the state suggests Is we — instead

of saying "father and mother," we say "father or mother, ivhich»
ever is the primary wage earner."
MRa FREEDMAN:

That is what the state is saying, but

in many ways it runs afoul of the test for remedy, starting
with the separability clause which is in the Social Security
Act, Itself, which provides that the invalidation of any pro­
vision of the Act -» and vie are discussing remedy, of course,
only if a provision of the Act has been held invalid — as it
applies to certain persons — shall not affect its application
to others.
And yet what the state is arguing for is the termination
of benefits to many families who currently receive them, be­
cause for some reason the father, while unemployed and while
his unemployment has made the family needy, the father does not
satisfy the primary wage earner test for some reason.
So, clearly, the separability clause of the Act would
be violated.

Moreover, the administration of the AFDC program

would be seriously disrupted throughout the country, as the
states attempted to grapple with the term "primary wage earner."
As I suggested before, the legislative history does

49

not give any guidance as to what 'brimary wage earnei1' means „
What Congress did do in 1961 and 1967 is make irrelevant the
employment of a spouse.

And we believe the Court should adhere

to that.
QUESTION:

What is the procedural posture of this

And injunctive relief.

MR. FREEDMAN;

Right.

MR. FREEDMAN:
Honor.

It really was the end of it# Your

The court entered its injunction on April 20 and# at

least# I think the United States and Plaintiffs thought the case
was over.

The state then came back and in the process of im­

So the parties had to go back and litigate the

Why didn’t they just say that?

It went

much farther than that»

It said# "I am not going to invalidate

MR. FREEDMAN:

No# the court did not rewrite it.

The court decided that# as between the choice# it could either

But the statute is still in force.

effects but has been held in doubt —

But the ”67 Amendment has been invalidated.

MR. FREEDMAN:

To the extent it changed the word

"parent” to "father#” yes, but not the rest of the Act.

So that reinstated the earlier# '61-'62 —

No. the state could opt out of the

The injunction, as in all welfare cases*

was so long as you are in the federal program you must comply
with the federal law that has not been rendered constitutional.
QUESTION:

Just say* "I enjoin the enforcement of this

unconstitutional statute."
MR. FREEDMAN:

I think the result would have been

the same.
QUESTION:

Why would it? The state would then have

had to decide what to do about it.
MR. FREEDMAN:

Well* it decides to opt in or out»

which is still the decision that it has.

The one thing it

cannot do is continue to discriminate on the basis of sex.
QUESTION:

If the court had held this statute* this

1967 statute* was unconstitutional and I enjoin its enforcement
for that reason* period.

Then there would have been no un­

employment — There would have been no AFDCU.
MR. FREEDMAN:

That would have been invalidation of

the program.
QUESTION:

Correct.

It was held to be unconstitutional.

Then it would have been up to Congress whether to have anything
at all* any AFDCU or to put in a sex-neutral on© or none at
all.

But until Congress acted* this 1967 statute would have

been held unconstitutional and the District Court would have

52

enjoined its enforcement for that reason.
MR* FREEDMAN:

That is not the course that has been

followed in any of the prior cases*

In Weinberg v, Wiesenfeld*

for example* the Court had the option of denying benefits to
all young widows who were caring for children in the home*
QUESTION:

That's an option of Congress*

MR. FREEDMAN:

Well* this Court did not give Congress

that option* of course.» it extended benefits.
In Goldfarb, this Court did not give Congress the
option* it extended benefit.

And in every case* it did the

right thing* we would submit* the only thing that could be
done under the circumstances* because the test* as all the
parties agree* Justice Harlan announced most succinctly In his

QUESTION:

That is correct.

But the principle

and the principle followed —
No one since has* as far as I know.

MR. FREEDMAN:

The principle followed has been the

question confronting a court in determining an aspect of a
statute unconstitutional is whether the entire program is to
be abolished, whether it is more consistent with Congress’
purposes* in terms of the entire program* to abolish the entire
program or to extend benefits to the class that has been ex­
cluded from the program.
We submit that the legislative history here shows
consistently that Congress' overwhelming concern was with the
needy children of unemployed parents* that benefits have
quadrupled in the program since 1967 when this provision was
last adopted* and that* therefore* the congressional purpose
is served by extending benefits to the class* and leaving to
Congress* over time* the choice of how it may wish to change
the program in any way.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon* at 11:17 o'clock* a.m.* the case was
submitted.)
