MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 991» Callfano* and the consolidated case»
Mr, Buscemi* you may proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI* ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF JOSEPH A. CALXFAMQ* JR,* SECRETARY OF
HEALTH* EDUCATION* AND WELFARE
MR, BUECEMI:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may ifc please

the Court:
The principle issue in these consolidated cases is
whether the Constitution forbids Congress from providing that
certain Federal welfare benefits should be paid only for those
months during which the recipient is in the United States for
at least part of the month.
The cases are here on appeal from the United States
District Court for the Southern District of California.

The

named Appellee in No. 77-991* Grace Aznavorian* receives bene­
fits under the Supplemental Security Income program.

That

program was established in 1972* and it was designed to con­
solidate and improve upon the previously ejcisting cooperative
Federal State Aid programs for the aids to the blind and disabled.
The Social Security Administration was assigned the
task of administering the new program and the Federal Govern­
ment agreed to bear the entire cost of providing basic monthly

4
benefit levels for persons who could establish financial need
and who could satisfy the requirements of age, blindness or
disability provided in the statute.
The benefit levels under the Supplemental Security
Income program are set by reference to the cost-of-living in
the United States.
were $146,

In 1974, Aznavorian's monthly benefits

Today, after several cost “of -living increases,

they are approximately $190 a month.
I would like to emphasize at the outset that the
Supplemental Security Incane program involved in this case is
a Federal welfare program involving Government grants to
persons needing public financial assistance to live in the
United States.

It is completely unrelated to the Social

Security Old Age, Survivors, Disability Insurance program.
Unlike that program which is funded out of a trust fund from
employer and employee contributions, the Supplemental Security
Income program is funded out of general revenues and its only
similarity to the Social Security Insurance program is that
they both are administered by the Social Security Administra­
tion.
A&navorian began receiving benefits, on January 1,
1974, the date that the SSI program became effective.

She v/as

converted from her previous coverage under a California wel­
fare program for the disabled and, therefore, she began re­
ceiving benefits immediately.

Shortly, thereafter, on July 21,

5
197^s she left fche United States and traveled to Guadalajara*
Mexico.

She did not return to fche country until September 1»

197^ and as a consequence of that trip she lost her SSi bene­
fits for August and September of 1974.

The Social Security

Administration refused to pay benefits for those months be­
cause of Section 1611(f) of the Social Security Act* which is
the statutory provision that is at issue in this case»
Congress adopted Section 1611(f) because it wanted fee
insure that Federal Welfare benefits were paid only to people
who actually need them to live in the United dfcafces.

The

legislature did not forbid SdX recipients from traveling
abroad.

It provided only thatjjwhere otherwise eligible

persons decide to take foreign trips for an extended period of
fcime*they may not receive welfare benefits for fche time they
are outside the country.

This purpose to provide public assis­

tance only to persons who need it to support themselves in the
United States is accomplished by Section 1611(f),
contains two sentencesc

That section

The first sentence provides that "no

person shall be considered eligible for £SX benefits for any
month during all of which he or she ie outside the United
states."

Aznavorian lost her CSX benefits for August 197^
!

because of the operation of this sentence.
The second sentence of 1611(f) provides that "once
an otherwise eligible recipient is outside the country for
30 consecutive days* he is treated as remaining outside fche

6
country until he has returned to the United States and stayd
here for 30 consecutive days."

Aznavorlan lost her benefits

for September 197^ because of the operation of this second
sentence.
Now* I would like to make one thing clear about the
way the second sentence of Section 1611(f) operates* before 1
go any further.

If a person is outside the country for 30

consecutive days* he is treated as remaining outside the
country until he returns and stays in the United States for
30 consecutive days.

But this does not mean that he cannot

receive SSI benefits for any of that 30-day waiting period.
If the 3Q~day waiting period expires before the end of the
month* the person can receive his full SSI benefits for that
month.

Thus* a person* for example* who leaves on June 10th

and returns to the United States on July 20th* if he is still
in the country on August 19* thirty days later* he will re­
ceive benefits for the full month of August.

The provision is

designed only to equalize treatment between people who are out­
side the country for a full calendar month and those who are
out for a period longer than 30 days* which spans two calendar
months* and therefore they are in the country for par's of each.
QUESTION:

In your hypothetical case* he would lose

benefits for one month only* is that it?
MR. BUSCjEMI:

In my hypothetical* yes.

benefits only for the month of July.

He would lose

7
QUESTION:
thetical case»

I am sorry.

I am puzzled about the hypo­

He wasn't out for the whole month of July in

your hypothetical case, so why would he lose -MR» BUECEMX:

He was outside the country for 20

days and then the remaining 10 days of the month, or the
remaining 11 days of the month, he is treated as being outside
the country, under the second sentence of Section 1611(f).
QUESTION:

1 see.

MR„ BUSCEMI:

Now, it is the Secretary's position

that Section 1611(f) is rationally related to the legitimate
Government purpose of limiting welfare payments to persons who
actually need them to live in the United State®.

Appellees in

the District Court believe, however, that the operation of
Section 1611(f) involves an unconstitutional infringement on
the right to travel outside the United States.

Appellees,

after exhausting their available administrative remedies, filed
this class action and alleged that the suspension of SSI bene­
fits to otherwise eligible recipients who are outside the
country for 30 or more consecutive days, is an improper penalty
on the exercise of what she called "the fundamental constitu­
tional right to foreign travel."
Now, District Court did not completely accept
Appellee's position.

It observed that international travel

has traditionally been subject to more controls than inter­
state travel and said that the right to travel internationally

8
should not be equated or put on an equal footing with the
right to travel interstate.
However, the court did decide that the right to
international travel is a basic constitutional right and,
therefore, that any governmental restriction, no matter how
minor on such travel, must bear a fair and substantial relation­
ship to a legitimate Government purpose.
The court concluded that Congress could have chosen
less drastic means to prevent fraudulenti claims for SSI bene­
fits and to insure that such benefits were paid only to United
States residents.

The court, therefore, declared Section 1611

(f) unconstitutional and directed the Secretary to pay
Aznavorian the benefits she would have received in August and
September of 1974, had it net been for her trip to Mejcico.
We believe that the District Court erred in applying
this unusually stringent standard of review to Section 1611(f).
The Court has repeatedly held that statutory classifications of
this kind in social welfare programs should be sustained if
they bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental
purpose.

Indeed, in Califano v. Jobst, decided just last term,

the Court made clear that the validity of a- particular classi­
fication must be measured against the rational basis standard,
even if the classification may have some .incidental effect on
a constitutionally protected right, in that case the right to
marry

9
Another case decided last term, Callfano v. Gautier
Torres, demonstrates the District Court error in this case in
assigning a special constitutional status to the right to
travel abroad.

As the Court said in Gautier Torres, "the right

to international travel does not enjoy the same degree of con­
stitutional protection as the right to travel interstate.

The

right to travel outside the country is protected by the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and, as such., can be
regulated within the bounds of due process."

This statement

runs directly counter, we submit, to the District Court’s
holding in this case.
Now, the District Court cites three Supreme Court
cases for its proposition that an especially strong showing is
required to justify any Infringement on the right to travel
abroad.

None of those cases support the result reached below.

Kent v. Dulles, the first of the cases, was a statutory inter­
pretation case that simply held fetet tho--Secretary of State

did

not have the power, under the statutes passed in 1952 and 1956,
to deny passports solely on the basis of personal beliefs,
political views, political expressions,

Aptheker v. Secretary

of Estate recognized Congress* right to regulate travel abroad,
but simply held that a particular exercise of that power, the
Subversive Activities Control Act, went too far by making it a
crime for any member of any Communist organization to use or
even apply for a passport

10

Finally,

Zemel v. Rusk, cited by Appellees in the

District Court, not only acknowledged the congressional power
to regulate travel outside the country, but upheld the con­
stitutionality of the Passport Act of 1926 to the extent that
it was interpreted to permit the Secretary of State to refuse
to validate passports for persons who want to travel to particu­
lar countries if the Secretary found that such travel might be
injurious to American foreign policy positions.
In none of those cases, did the Court indicate that
there was a special standard that needed to be applied any time
there was an infringement on the right to travel abroad.
It is worth pointing out, I think, that Section
1611(f) does not prohibit any foreign travel.

It is absolutely

neutral with respect to trips of 30 days or less.

And, with

respect to longer trips, the Congress has chosen to provide
only that no SSI benefits will be paid for months during all
of which the recipient is outside the country.
As a practical matter, of course, the SSI recipient’s
ability to travel abroad for lengthy periods is limited by
financial factors that are unrelated to Section 1611(f),

In

order to receive SSI benefits at all,the recipient must demon­
strate that he has less than $1500 in personal resources.
Foreign trips lasting longer than the 30-day period are un­
likely to be within the financial reach of most SSI recipients.
And if such trips are made possible in some cases by the

11
availability of accommodations with friends or relatives out­
side the country, this is precisely the kind of situation in
which the payment of SSI benefits to persons outside the
country would be inappropriate.
*

We believe, as I said before, that Section 1611(f)
is rationally related to a legitimate congressional goal, pro­
viding financial aid to persons who need it to live in the
United States.

We also think, as we stated in the brief, that

it is related to the purpose of paying SSI benefits only to
United States residents, a purpose that Appellees concede is a
legitimate one.
Section 1611(f) makes it unnecessary for the Social
Security Administration to decide each time a recipient leaves
the country whether that person is abandoning his United States
residence.

The Social Security Administration simply stops

payments after the recipient has been outside the country for
a full month.

We believe that this is a rational legislative

judgment that should be upheld.
Now, we have also argued in our brief that the
District Court's award of retroactive monetary relief was
improper because Congress did not choose to waive sovereign
immunity for claims that benefits were unconstitutionally denied
under -- even when they were denied in accordance with a statu­
tory provision.

We have also argued that the District Court'©

limitation of relief to the currently needy members of the

12

class was a legitimate exercise of the District Court's equi­
table discretion.
Unless the Court has questions on the first part of
the brief or any of these other two* I would like to reserve
the remainder of my time for rebuttal0
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER A 9 SCHEY* ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF GRACE AZNAVORIAN
MR. SCHEY:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:
This case offers this Court a first opportunity to
provide plenary review to this nation's income maintenance
program.

It likewise provides a first opportunity to provide

plenary review to an international right to travel case* since
Zemel v9 Rusk case in 1965»
The income maintenance program* also known as the
SSI program* provides the subsistence for
citizens.

million American

These persons are elderly persons who were either

disabled at birth or disabled later in life —
QUESTION:

Does it make any difference what the

factual situation is* in that respect* for the basic question
before the Court?
MR. SCHEY:

We believe it does make a difference*

Your Honor* because many of these persons* elderly persons

13

over 65 years of age worked arduously throughout their lives
but they simply were unlucky enough not to work in ths right
kind of employment, the kind of employment which would have
covered them under Title 2 of the Social Security Act*

Had

they engaged in employment under Title 2 of the Social Security
Act, they would not only be able to travel freely around the
world, they would be able fcc reside any place that they so
desire*
QUESTION:
MR* SCHEY:
QUESTION:

That's because of statutory provisions*
That is correct*
But your submission, if Congress decided

otherwise, in these other programs -- Your submission would be
that would be invalid, too?
MR* SCHEY:

That is correct*

I think that our same

arguments would apply should the same restrictions apply to
Title 2*

I raise this because Mrs* Aznavorian, who worked as

a seamstress for most of her life here in the United States,
is simply not fortunate enough to have that covered by Title
2*

At this point, she is an elderly person, living with ill­

ness, who chose to go to Mexico -QUESTION:

This is Equal Protection you are arguing

now?
MR* SCHEY:

We believe that the case could be

analyzed under either an Equal Protection or a Due Process
approach.

We believe that the result would be the same under

14

either approach»
QUESTION:
they both apply.

I have great difficulty when you say that

I prefer if you pick one of them.

MR. SCHEY:

We believe that the primary analysis and

the primary analysis presented in our brief is a Due Process
analysis.
QUESTION:

That's what I thought* but that's not

what you are arguing now.
MR. SCHEY:

I was just mentioning her status vis-a-vis

the employment to highlight what we feel is the discriminatory,

QUESTION:

We can't deal with highlights.

We deal

with statutes.
MR. SCHJ2Y:

Yes* Your Honor.

I may point out that Mrs. Aznavorian traveled to
Mexico intending to return to the United States within one
month.

The record reflects that she was aware of the limita­

tions on her right to travel.
QUESTION:

The record also

You talk about the right to travel as

though that is established as a matter of constitutional law*
that there is a right of international travel.

Thatfe one of

the contested issues in this case* isn't it?
MR. SCHSY:
QUESTION:

Yes* it is* Ycur Honor.
As one who many years ago was influenced

in his legal education by somebody who nobody has heard of any

15

more» Professor Hofeld, I have often been concerned about this
throwing around loosely of the word "right.”

If somebody has

a right, somebody on the other side must have a duty.
Now, it has been held, hasn't it, at least in some
cases that the international travel by a citizen of the United
States or a resident of the United States is no more than a
freedom.

Isn't that correct?
MR. SC HEY:
QUESTION:

Your Honor -As contrasted with interstate travel

which has been established as a constitutional right.
MR. SCHEYs

Your Honor, we believe, contrary to the

Secretary, that the cases of Kent, Aptheker and Zemel clearly
establish — And,, in fact, that 750 years of Anglo-American

jurisprudence clearly establish a right to leave the boundaries
of this country and to reenter the boundaries of this country.
While the case of Aptheker, which also decided the
constitutionality of a ,sfcatufce*did not utilize language wedded
to a strict two-tier analysis, the language utilized is inter­
esting.

If I may just quote one or two sentences:

"Even though

the Government purpose be legitimate and substantial, that pur­
pose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental
personal liberties, when the end can be more narrowly achieved."
QUESTION:
about liberties.

That doesn't talk about rights.

It talks

And liberty is a synonym for freedom.

MR, SCHEY:

That is correct. Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:
MR. SCHEY:

That's directly from Shelton v. Tucker»
That is correct.

And It is interesting

to note that the case of Shapiro v, Thompson relies in Its
adoption of a heightened scrutiny standard, relies on precisely
the same cases which the case of Aptheker relied on.

In fact*

it relies on precisely the same pages of the same cases that
the Aptheker case relied on,
QUESTION:

Mr. Schey, your reference to the Kent,

Aptheker and Zemel cases, which are obviously in controversy
here between you and your opponent, brings to my mind this
question, which is highlighted by the language on page 16 of
381 U.S., from Zemel v. Rusk, where the Court says that "the
claim is different from that which is raised in Kent and in
Aptheker for the refusal to validate Appellant's passport does
not result from any expression or association on his part."
Don't you think it is fair to say that all three of
those cases did have some sort of First Amendment overtones
to them?
MR, SCHEY:

Well, Your Honor, I do agree.

I think

that all three cases did have First Amendment overtones. -QUESTION:
MR. SCHEY:

And claims.
~ However, the Court in Zemel very clearly

stated at page 16, ,lWe cannot accept the contention of Appellant that It is a First Amendment right which is here involved."
To the extent that the .Secretary's refusal to validate

17

passports acts as an Inhibition, it is an inhibition action.
And there are few restrictions on action which could not be
clothed by ingenious argument in the garb of decreased data
flow.
Now, clearly, though -- and I should also point out.
Your Honors, that in a concurring opinion in the case of
Aptheker, Justice Black,in contrast to the majority opinion,
relied on the First Amendment and felt that it was unnecessary
to Invoke the Fifth Amendment, as the majority had done,
QUESTION:

Didn't Aptheker involve prohibition,

complete prohibition, at trial?
MR. SCHEY:

No, it did not, Your Honor.

That is

one of the arguments that the Secretary makes here.

The

Secretary's argument throughout is that no more than a rational,
basis test should apply here.

And he draws that conclusion by

saying that the impact here is only indirect, it is not direct.
However, this Court recognized -- it certainly
recognized in Shapiro v. Thompson -QUESTION:
MR. SCHEY:

No, I am talking about Aptheker.
And it also recognized in Aptheker and

In Kent and in Zernel -QUESTION:
MR. SCHEY:
Your Honor.

Aptheker did not involve complete —
»- an absolute prohibition.

It did not.

All that it involved was the fact that he could

not get a passport.

In fact, in Zernel, which was the only case

13

that fchis Court has ever decided in which it found that the
Government interest —
QUESTION:
MR. SCHEY:
QUESTION:
MR, SCHEY:

You can travel without a passport?
That is absolutely correct, Your Honor»
Don’t you sort of go to jail if you do?
No, you don’t.

I believe, 1976, in the case of

And that was decided in,

U,SC v, Laub in fchis very Court,

In fact, in that case, in U.S, v. Laub, which is cited in our
briefs, the Government and the parties agreed that hundreds of
persons had traveled -- not only thousands had traveled without
passports -- but that hundreds had traveled through the years
in violation of the area restrictions that were involved -QUESTION:

How many people do you think have com-»

mitfced robberies and haven't been arrested?
MR. SCHEY:

Your Honor, the issue in Laub was not

whether or not the people had been cauijht or not
QUESTION:
MR* SCHEY:

I am talking about Apfcheker.
Your Honor, in Aptheker, the person was

not precluded from traveling.

There was no direct prohibition

on his right to leave the country.

The sole question was

whether or not he could leave the country with a passport.
It was an indirect prohibition, and the same was true in the
case of Zemel v. Rusk, which, of course, in that case the
Government interest was extremely large.
crisis was occurring at the time.

The Cuban missile

And, nevertheless, Mr. Zeme3

19

could still travel to Cuba, which is where he wanted to go.
I am not saying that that is right or wrongs but that is the
reality.

What the case decided — and, in fact, what every

case -- this Court very clearly said in the case of Memorial
Hospital v0 Maricopa County, that in order to find infringement
— and it is said in the abortion cases —
QUESTION:

What international travel was involved in

that case?
MR. SCHEY:
QUESTION:
MR, SCHEY:
national case.

In which case, Your Honor?
Maricopa County case.
Your Honor, that was not an inter­

However, I believe that the importance of that

case, as the importance in Aptheker, Kent and Zemel, is that
this Court

does not require a total flat prohibition on the

exercise of a right before it finds an infringement of that
right«
QUESTION:

First of all, you have to find a right,

under the Constitution.

Now, are you suggesting that the

freedom to leave our country and travel internationally is
the precise equivalent of the right to travel from state to
state?
MR. SCHEY:
QUESTION:
MR. SCHEY:
QUESTION:

No, we are not claiming that.
They are quite different, aren't they?
That is correct, Your Honor.
It is unthinkable that a passport be

20

required fco travel from New York to Ohio* and yet it is ac­
cepted that a passport is required fco travel from New York to
France*
MR0 SCHEY:

That is absolutely correct, Your Honor*

We do not take the position that fche international
ability fco travel back and forth across fche frontiers has the
equivalent constitutional weight that interstate right fco travel
has*
that.

And I think that the decisions of this Court indicate
I should also point out* though, that this Court and

lower courts for fche pasfc 20 years — and a number of fche
cases are cifced in our brief, about half a page of cases —
have cited fche interstate and fche international cases inter­
changeably, in recognizing -QUiSTION:

From the way you have just answered my

question, you would concede that; fchafc was mistaken or too
loose on fche part of those courts*
MR0 SCHEY:

That is correct, Your Honor*

We feel

that in the case of Aptheker this Court defined fche travel as
"a fundamental liberty."

And they then went on,

unlike what

the Secretary suggests, "that they merely applied a rational
basis test," That is absolutely false.

The Government argued

a rational basis test in Kent, in Aptheker in Zemel and in
haub, and in all four of those cases this Court rejected the
terminology of a rational basis test*

This, in fact, marks

the fifth occasion in which the Government has requested fchafc

21

this Court adopt no more than a rational basis test when
analyzing the fundamental liberty of traveling across our
borders.

In every one of the prior cases, that request was

denied.

In fact, In Aptheker, the lower court specifically

applied a rational basis test.

In Aptheker and Zemel, the

dissent in this Court specifically applied a rational basis
test.
We believe that, while not arguing that the same
heightened scrutiny,that the strictest scrutiny which applied
in Shapiro should apply in this case.
QUESTION:

We have argued --

Here you are equating again Interstate

travel with foreign travel, when you speak of Shapiro.
MR. SCHEY:

Your Honor, we are not arguing -- My

statement was that we are not arguing that the strictest
of scrutiny standards which were developed in Shapiro do apply
here.

Instead,

are arguing that this Court should recognize,

as it has done in matters of marriage, as it has done In matters
of abortion, as it has done in matters of illegitimacy, that
here involved is a basic liberty.

And in all of those cases,

as Mr. Justice Blackmun pointer] out in Mathews v0 Lucas,
Mr, Justice Stevens in Califano v. Jobst, the two cases just
cited by the Secretary, in looking at the relationship between
the purpose of a governmental restriction and the means imple»
mented to effectuate that purpose, those cases which both
involved Social Security benefits stated, "We must look at the

22

reasonably empirical judgments of the presumptions Involved."
The Jobat case* cited by the Secretary* said*

"We

must look to see whether tradition and common experience support
the presumptions,"

We would argue, Your Honors* that neither

reasonable empirical judgments nor tradition and common experi­
ence, nor any of the tests outlined in Apfchsker, would support
this statute.
The Secretary argues that the purpose of the statute
— and his primary argument -- is that it implements the resi­
dency requirements.

When we carefully examine the statute* it

is patently clear that it comes nowhere close to doing anything
even superficially related with implementing a residency re­
quirement.

First of all, the statute has no legislative .

history whatsoever and no legislative study whatsoever.
. QUJSdTION:

Is this provision, or isn't it* equival­

ent to a provision that would say "these benefits are payable
but only for the purpose of spending in the United States"?
MR. SCHJ3Y:

Well* Your Honor, if that’s what the

statute intends to accomplish -QUESTION:

Would it be equivalent to that, or not?

Would you be making the same arguments if the statute

said

that on its face?
MR0 SC HEY:

No, I think I would then be making dif­

ferent arguments about the validity of that kind of restriction.
We would probably then be discussing balance of payments

23

deficits.
QUESTION:

Would you still be arguing that it

violated what you called a right to travel?
MR* SCHEY:

Well* Your Honor* I think* under those

circumstances* we would have to examine* as I think we have to
do under these circumstances* the legitimacy of the purpose*
We may assume that under those circumstances the purpose would
be legitimate* requiring expenditure of funds only in the
United States.
QUESTION:

Would you be here if the statute said

that?
MR. SCHEY:

Yes* I think we would* because we would

still have to analyze whether or not the statute effectuated
those purposes.

Under the present Social Security program*

there is absolutely no restriction on where a person spends
their money.

We would still have to examine whether or not --

QUESTION:
MR. SCHEY:

That's an Equal Protection argument.
In the hypothetical that you are placing*

as to whether or not a -- would the statute read"restricting
money to be expended within the United States*" — would we
still be here?

I think we would still have to look to the

degree to which that infringed on the right to travel.
QUESTION:

Do you think this Court is bound by the

purposes or the goals that the Government professes to give
for this statute?

24

MR* fiCREY:

No* I do not,

I believe that this Court

could examine any reasonable goals which Congress may have
intended by the statute»
QUESTION:

I think* however --

Because the statute* on Its face* doesn't

particularly say* does it* what the purpose is?
MR, SCHEY:

Mo* but the legislative history* in both

the Senate report and in the House report, which are cited in
our briefs* they state -- and unfortunately there are only about
two sentences which describe the purpose of the statute — but
in both the Senate and House reports* the purpose of the
statute is outlined as being to restrict the SSI recipients
from taking on residence outside of the United States for one
month or longer,
QUESTION:
MR. SCHEY:

What would be the purpose of that?
Well* certainly* one purpose may be* as

you are suggesting* to limit expenditures of SSI money within
the United States*
QUESTION:

Because if people took up residence out-

Bide* then you could have a residence requirement and you
would save a lot of money,
MR, SCHEY:

That is correct* but it should be noted*

however* that the underlying purpose appears to be a legislative
judgment that SSI programs and need “based programs which are
adapted to levels of income* levels of cost of living* etcetera*
should be limited to persons who reside within the United States

25

It is interesting to note that the Congress said
absolutely nothing about expenditurej what they limited was the
person's ability to travel.
QUESTION:

They also*, rather specifically limited

the person's right to receive funds when they are outside the
country* didn't they?

Which is certainly one of the purposes

Congress had in mind* that if a person stayed outside the
country more than 30 days that person x^culd not receive Social
Security benefits.

Congress has expressed that purpose in so

many words in the statute you are challenging.
MR. ECHEY:
QUESTION:

‘That is absolutely correct.
So* certainly that fulfills Congress'

purpose* does it not?
MR. SCHEY:

That is correct.

I think* though* that

in so limiting receipt of Sii I benefits* again* the clear pur­
pose of Congress appears to have been to limit it to residents
within the United states.
QUESTION: . Why do we need to worry about what it
appears to be*when we have spelled out in so many words in
this statute that you are challenging?

Dojrou think Congress*

just kind of in a fit of absenfcmindedness passed this statute?
MR. ECHEY:

No* I think that -- I think* and what we

are requesting this Court to come to conclusion^ that in balan­
cing the infringement on the right to travel that the statute
would have against the purpose that Congress was attempting to

26

achieve* namely to limit SSI payments to persons who reside
within the United States* that Congress simply did not give
sufficient concern to the impact on the right to travel0

They

did not* for example* limit your ability* if you live anywhere
close to the Mexican border or if you live anywhere close to
the Canadian border.

Nothing in the Act anywhere suggests

that you cannot spend your entire income across the border.
QUESTION:

That argument isn't based on failure of

this particular statute you are challenging to conform to the
overall congressional purpose.

That's based on when it violates

a constitutional substantive right.
MR. SCHEY:
QUESTION:
to travel.

That is correct.
Let's get back for a moment to this right

As I read this statute* it is aimed at people who

travel* light and remain there.

You wouldn't say that's

protected* would you?
MR. SCHEY:
QUESTION:

I am not sure I understand.
A person who moves to Guadalajara* marries

and lives there for the rest of his life and becomes a citizen,
MR. SCHEY:

Yes* I see what you mean.

QUESTION:

That isn't protected* right?

MR, SCHEY:

Absolutely not* Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Now* If somebody leaves and travels to

Mexico and stays there for five years*, is that protected by
the right to travel?

27

MR0 SCHEY:

Your Honor, we feel that it is necessary

to examine the extent of the infringement,

We feel that the

Secretary can and he already does —
QUESTION:

Then you agree that the Secretary can

look Into that?
MR, SCHEY:
Honor,

Absolutely, and he already does* Your

The Secretary already has a whole series of objective

criteria —
QUESTION:

Would you try to limit your answers to

the length of my question?
MR, SCHEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,
How far can the Secretary go in order to

inquire into whether or not you are coming back?
MR, SCHEY:

Your Honor, the Secretary already has

a set of criteria which he uses.

Persons who are going to

travel are required to Inform the Secretary that they intend
to travel.

And we have no problem with that.

They are re­

quired -QUESTION:

But doesn't that interfere with his right

to travel?
MR, SCHEY:

MR, SCHEY:

No, because we do not feel -Then the right isn't absolute, is it?
That is absolutely correct. Your Honor,
What are you arguing?
We are arguing» Your Honor» that in

-- given the purposes for which we assume,and Government
statistics appear to support, that most persons travel.

In

1972, a Government study -- and unfortunately the most recent
one accomplished — indicates that 50$ of the approximately
8 million persons who travel are traveling to see family and
friends.

We assume that elderly SSI recipients, for the most

part, are not traveling for business reasons.

They are

traveling —
QUESTION:

I thought you said there was no legisla­

tive history on this section.
MR, SCHEY:
QUESTION:

There is not, Your Honor.
Well, if there is none, why are you

arguing this point, if you don’t have anything?

It seems to

me this is stuff that should have been presented to Congress.
MR. SCHEY: . Well, Your Honor, I would agree.

I

would think that these matters should have been considered.
QUESTION:

Are you going to present it to Congress

or are you going to present it to us

and get us to rewrite the

Act?
MR. SCHEY:
Act, Your Honor.

No, we are not asking you to rewrite the

We are asking you to find that in its balan^

clng efforts Congress did not give sufficient weight to the
infringement that this statute would cause on the right to
travel.
Your previous question, concerning the time, the

29

Secretary already has alternative means.

The one test that

appears over and over again in Kent, in Aptheker, in Zenel is
are there alternative means?

Does the Government have alterna­

tive means for accomplishing the same purpose?

The Secretary

already has those means and we have no problems with them.
Those means adopt objective criteria.

Is the person maintaining

Is the person's family remaining

How long does the person intend to

Does the person have a return ticket?
We believe that those objective criteria which

mandate a duty

the Secretary has a separate duty under a

separate statute, Section 1613 of the Social Security Act,
to measure residence.

That duty is never suspended.

parsons come back to the United States and they have to wait
that additional thirty days before they can get the very money
upon which they survive
QUESTION:

Under this section, Counsel, under this

particular section, is there a limit on the earnings that the
recipient may ro.ake?
MR. SCHEY:

There is a limit on the earnings and I

believe that to be an amount substantially less than the
current grant level, which is $189»
QUESTION:

Is it as convenient for the Government to

check on those earnings if the recipient is in Yugoslavia?
MR. SCHEY:

Your Honor, the recipient has a statutory

30

duty to report to the Secretary changes In circumstances»
QUESTION:

We know that some people do not fulfill

that«
MR» SCHEY:

That is correct* but it is interesting

to note that the Secretary relies on the assertions of the
recipient in order to fulfill his duties»

As the District

Court correctly pointed out —
QUESTION:
they?

They are not limited to that reply* are

The Government is not limited»

MR. SCHEY:

Absolutely not* Your Honor»

And they

could call in the recipient for an interview and they could
require affidavits from other persons to substantiate -QUESTION:

If he is on the payroll of some other

company receiving several thousand dollars* something in
excess of the permissible limit* they might find it out that
way* is that not so?

How do they find it out if he is in

Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union?
MR0 SCHEY:

I think it is important to recognize*

Your Honor* that we believe that clearly at some point travel
becomes residence abroad.

We clearly believe

and the

Secretary has regulations already adopted to meet those situ­
ations.

The Secretary already has a whole set of objective

criteria* because all he does when a person travels for 30
days is he does not suspend their benefits -- Excuse me* he
does not terminate their benefits* he simply suspends them.

31
His obligation to test their residency is maintained through­
out their travel,

It is maintained when they come back.

He

says — and the Secretary admits in the record -- that his
tests are# quote# "easy#” unquote# to administer.

of residency.

He has the test to determine acquisition

He has a very detailed test to determine the

abandonment of residence.
As to the point that Mr. Chief Justice raised about
the honesty of the applicant, the District Court recognized,
as this Court recognized in a number of other cases, that
when the Government attempts to establish a bright line rule
for the purpose of avoiding fraud, which is one of the primary
purposes the Secretary argues here, the section prevents fraud.
In this case, the person can just as easily be dishonest about
falling under the bright line rule.

They can be just as dis­

honest about fchati in fact, we believe It would be far easier
to be dishonest about whether you fall into the bright line
rule than it would be to be dishonest about whether or not you
are maintaining a residence in the United States.

That would

certainly be more, difficult to be di-shonest about
because they are,v<wy objective criteria which can be

So, in order to prevent dishonesty in the program,
the Secretary creates this rule, which very effectively pre­
vents SSI recipients, elderly persons, from traveling for
very, very personal reasons.

And yet, the rule allows persons

to be just as dishonest as to whether or not they intend to.
