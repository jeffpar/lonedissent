CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments nesct

in 78-605, United States against Rutherford.
Mr. Solicitor General.,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE Ho McCREE, JR., ESQ0,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL McCREEs

v

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

'v

This ease concerns a drug or group of drugs variously
referred to in the record as Laetrile, with a capital "L,"
le.efcri.te with a lower case "l," amygdalin, and Vitamin B-17.
Part of the problem with this case is the difficulty
of distinguishing just which drug is referred to in a
particular content.
Gsnarically, this drug or group of drugs comprise
a compound known as & cyanogen®fcic glucoside.

I understand

\
a glucosid® !to be one of a group of organic compounds found
?

in the kernels and seeds of most fruit that hydrolise or
break down to yield glucose, which is a sugar? and in the
case of a cyanogenie glucoside, hydrogen cyanide, as well,
which of course, is a poison.
Amygdalin is the name of a cyanogenie glucoside
that is frequently used interchangeably with Laetrile, either
with a capital "1” or a small eas® "1."
On® other definition might be useful.

One of the

4

chemical definitions of laetr ils---ar proper definitions of
laetrile--that has bean~"was mad© in the administrative,
record as laevo, i-a-a-v-o, laevo-manda 1 o n i trile-betaglueosida.
1 say all of that, to suggest tha origin of the name,
l&etrile.

L-a-e-v-o is the first part, which means "left,"

as I understand it from the Latin.
tha chemical.

And mandelonitrile is

And if we tak® "i-a-e" from "laevo," and the

"t-r-i-1-®" from "mandelonitrile," we have laetrile.
And this is the drug with which w© ara concerned
today.

The left business, the "laevo," is in contrast to

"d©Kfero" which would foe a right rotation.

And it refers to

the way these two drugs show up in polarized light.
The proponents of this drug laetrile contend that
it is a cancer cure, and in soma instances, a cancer preven­
tive.
The processes change from time to time, but in snort
it appears to bo the £ollov?ing:

It is the theory of the

proponents that laetrile roleasaa hydrocyanic acid, which is
a poison, and it does so in the presence of an enzyme that
allegedly occurs in greater concentration in malignant cells
than it does in normal calls.

And therafor© tha malignant

cells are destroyed by tha action of this chemical.
The case comas before us as a consequence of a
curious proceeding.

The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act

5

prohibits the introduction ©f any new drug as defined in the
statute into interstate commerce unless a new drug application,
a NDA, supported by appropriate evidence of the drug's

safety

and effectiveness, has been approved by the Commissioner of
the Food and Drug Administration, who is the Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare0s designate? or unless the
drug is exempted from the approval requirements by one of the
act's two grandfather provisions: One in 1938 and the ether
in 1962, both of which are still operative,,
l.........

Because Laetrile had not been established as being
entitled to grandfather status, or as having met the statutory
requirements for approval as a new drug, the Food and Drug
Administration brought a series of civil and criminal proceed­
ings to prevent the introduction of laetrlle under various
names into interstate commerce0
In March, 1975, respondents brought a suit in the
United States District Court for the Western District of
Oklahoma to enjoin the government from interfering with the
sale and distribution to patients suffering from cancer of
a substance known as B~17, laetril© and anygdalin„
The District"»
QUESTION:

What was the status of tha respondents?

What conferred upon them standing to briny this suit?
GENERAL McCREEs

That’s a question for which X

haven’t a good answer, if the Court please.

The government

6

has raised the question of the jurisdiction of the court and
their standing»
government.

But it was decided adversely to the

And in its present posture, we suggest that on a

remand, there probably was jurisdiction.
But at this stage, I cannot answer, Mr» Justice
Stewart.
QUESTION:

Are these-™do the respondents allege in

their complaint that they want to use it, or members of their
family want to use it?
GENERAL McCREE?
QUESTIONi

They wish to use it.

They're not producers or sellers of it,

are they?
GENERAL McCREE$

They’re not producers.

They

allege that they were patients suffering from cancer, and
that they were terminally ill caneor patients.

And they

were later certified as a class consisting of terminally
ill cancer patients.
And they wish access to the drug for their therapy
to be administered to them by their physicians.
The District Court issued a preliminary injunction
forbidding the government from preventing the purchase and
interstate movement of laetrile for respondent Rutherford and
the other members of the class who could show by affidavit
that they were terminally ill with cancer.
On appeal by the government, the Tenth Circuit

7

upheld the granting of the injunction, but instructed the
District Court to remand the case to the Commission for the
development of an administrative record adequate under the
Administrative Procedures Act,

addressing the issues, first,

whether laetrile is a new drug within the meaning of the Actj
and second, if so, whether it is exempt from the

premarketing

requirements because of either the 1938 or the 1962 grandfather
clause»
Upon remand, the Commissioner initiated administrat™
ive proceedings through a Federal Register announcement
seeking public comment.
In the proceedings, which included two days of

oral

presentation, produced more than 400 submissions and more than
5,000 pages of testimony, at the conclusion of which the
Commissioner concluded, first, that laetrile was a broad
generic term for a group of related compounds, and that in its
various forms, it is a new drug within the meaning of the
Food and Drug Act; and that it was definitely toxic when
taken orally; that it had not b-sen adequately tested for
safety; that it was not generally recognised among experts
as safe for use in man; and the distribution prior to meeting
the pre-marketing approval of the FDA, would be unlawful,
unless It qualified for exempt status under either grandfather
provision. .
He concluded that it was not exempt under the 1938

8

exemption} grandfather exemption? or the 1962, because the
drug with which he was concerned had not been used commercially
under the same or similar label for therapeutic purposes
before either the 1938 time or the 1962 time, which would
have permitted it to continue in commarceo
Ha concluded that the distribution of laetrile in
interstate commerce is in violation of the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, and subject to regulatory action.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Solicitor General, what evidence

did the District Court have before it as the basis for
finding that this was* non-toxic?
GENERAL McCREEt

If

the Court please, the District

Court, when it initially granted the injunction, had no
evidence before it except-QUESTION:

But he did make a finding that it was

non-toxic, did he not?
That’s my impression from the summary of your
argument or part of your brief.
GENERAL McCREE:

Well, the matter went back to the

District Court from the Administrative hearing; and do I
understand you're inquiring about the second time the
District Court looked at it or the first time?
QUESTION:

Well,

1

wasn't clear from what I read

whether it was the second time or the first time.
At any time, what evidence did the District Court

9

have of this drug--this njaterial--baiug non-toxic?
GENERAL McCREEs

It's my understanding that the

District Court did not take evidence in this matter but
relied on the administrative record that was made.
QUESTION:

But he did make a finding that it was

non-toxic?
GENERAL McCREEs

He made a finding when he reviewed

this administrative record that 1•v® just related, which is
the next step in the proceeding.
What the District Court did was to sustain the
Commissioner's conclusion that

laetrile was a new drug.

He

agreed that it was not exempt under the 1338 grandfather
clause.

But he concluded that it was exempt under the 1962

grandfather cla\ise; and in doing so, we contend^improperly
reviewed the evidence that was before the Commissioner, and
that vras—that was properly within the jurisdiction of the
Commissioner to make findings.
And then he did a curious thing which we contend
also was in error.

He held that the Food and Drug Administration

had offended the eons'fcitutional right to privacy by denying
the right to use a non-toxic substance inconnection with one's
own personal health, despite his finding--the Commissioner’s
finding that laetrile has a known toxicity when taken orally
and that the testing is insufficient to determine its toxicity
in any form.

QUESTION:

Well, isn't there an additional curiosity

about the District Court's constitutional holding in that he
had already found that it was covered by the grandfather clause
in '62 so ha didn't have to reach that question?
GENERAL McCREE:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we agree

that It was quite unnecessary for the District Court to make
that finding.

But the District Court did this nevertheless.

The government appealed it again to the Tenth Circuit
And the Tenth Circuit, without addressing the grandfather
ground, or the constitutional ground on which the District
Court relied, held as a xnafctor of law that the safety and
effectiveness terms used in the statute have no reasonable
applications to terminally ill cancer patients, and that the
Food and Drug Administrator had erroneously applied the Act
to these persons.
Nevertheless, it modified the District Court's
injunctions to limit the use to intravenous injections,
administered by a licensed medical practitioner, and only to a
person certified by a licensed medical practitioner to be
terminally ill of cancer in some form.
And he directed the Food and Drug Administration to
promulgate regulations within this limitation as if the drug
was found by the Commission to b@ safe and affective for the
terminally ill cancer patients.

And the matter is before this Cotart on a writ of
certiorari.
We submit that the following questions are presented
First, whether the safety and effectiveness require­
ments of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act apply to
drugs intended for us© by the terminally ill; which
issue on

i3

the

which the Court of Appeals decided the matters
We submit further that if the Court decides that

question as we think it should, it would want to consider the
two grounds found by the District Court for enjoining the
interstate distribution of the drug; and therefore it would
consider whether the judgment of the Court of Appeals barring
application of the Act to interstate distribution of the
drug for intravenous administration to terminally ill patients
is sustainable on the grounds that laetrila is exempt because
of the pre-marketing--from the pre-marketing requirements
because of the 1962 grandfather clause; and finally,
Whether the judgment of the Court of Appeals was
sustainable on the ground that the prohibition of the
interstate distribution violates a constitutional right to
privacy»
I'd like to address the first question now, if I
may.
QUESTION:

Those last two are really questions for

your opposition to propose.

12

GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION;

Indeed they ars»

And they have, I take it»

GENERAL McCREE;

And he's entitled to urge the Court

to sustain the judgment on those alternative grounds»
QUESTION:

And he has presented them?

GENERAL McCREE;

And he ha3 presented them, yes,

sir.

The~-\re submit that the Court of Appeals has
misconstrued the statute in holding that th© safety and
affective requirements of the Act do not apply to terminally
ill persons.
In the first place, the Act makes no such exception.
Thar© is no language in the Act that says it does not apply
to terminally ill persons.
And the legislative history does not support this
exception that's contended for,,

The Pood and Drug Administration

has consistently admlniatared the Act Without recognizing
such exception, and the Congress has indicated its acquescence
in th© administration--tha way the Act has been administered,
because on at least two occasions, it has amended the Act
without changing the construction that the Commission placed
on the statute.
Wa furthar submit that there's no reliable means
of identifying the class except in

retrospect.

Tha

administrative record teaches that cancer is a di3©as© about

which very little is known; that it frequently goes into
spontaneous remission for reasons not understood? and that a
person designated as terminally ill may surprise his
physician by outliving the prognosis that he makes at the
time the designation is indicated.
We also suggest that a drug can be unsafe? for a dying
person, contrary to the decision of the Court of Appeals, if
it poses a risk of shortening the life of the terminally
ill person, or if it poses the risk of aggravating the symptoms
experienced by the so-called terminally ill person.
QUESTION:

1 suppose you could add to that, if it

had any tendency or risk of hastening death?
GENERAL McCREE:

And of course if it was toxic, if it

hastened death, it would be a fortiori that it would be unsafe
for the terminally ill patient.
We also suggest that the drug is ineffective as
woll as unsafe if it does not produce the effects of prolonged
life or the surcease from pain that is claimed for it.

And if

it's ineffective, then wn say that the Court of Appeals was
erroneous in its determination.
We also submit that the terminally ill have tha
same right to be protected from ineffective drugs just as
other people have, and that the Tenth Circuit, by substituting
its judgment for that of the Agency charged by Congress with
the responsibility of keeping unsafe drug© out of the marketplace

was in error and that this Court should ravers© its judgment.
The grandfather's clause, if I

may pass to that

and anticipate the argument that’s in my brother's brief, we
submit--and perhaps my brother will answer this--that there's
no

claim that laetrile was marketed commercially before 1962.

And of course to be within the grandfather's clause, the parson
contending the exemption must show commercial marketing.
We submit that there was not, and we submit that the
administrative record is very clear about that.
The Commissioner also found that the composition of
different substances referred to as laetrile before and after
1962 varied as to their formulations so that no one could state
with certainty

just what substance had been grandfathered.

And of course there would b© another reason for the
grandfather's clause not to apply.
We also submit that the record supports the
Commissioner's conclusion that the drug was not generally
recognized as safe a0 required by Section 201(p).

Ha found

specifically that there was a hazard of cyanide poisoning.
And the record shows that when ingested orally the drug has
a very definite toxic effect, and that there was insufficient
testing of its consequences when taken by injections,
parenterally.
QUESTION j

General McCra©, in your view who has the

burden of proof on the grandfather clause issue?
GENERAL McCREE:

I would think the parson who

15

asserted the exemption would have the burden of proof.
QUESTION:

Are there any cases that so hold?

GENERAL McCREEs

I can't think of a. case that

specifically addresses that question.

But normally a person

claiming an exemption from a general rule, in the ordinary
theory of the allocation of the burden, would have to
sustain it.
This case is serious :Ln another respect:
the typical food and drug case.

It’s not

And so the matter of burden,

who bears the burden, takes on an interesting aspect.
Here we have patients contending that they have a
right to use a drug.

And it's not the typical case of the

manufacturer of a drug seeking a clearance for it when he
would understand what he had to show.
We think contrary to the finding of the District
Court that the Commissioner was extremely fair in the
hearing that, ho conducted, foeoause he invited persons who
were sponsors of the drug, who were not themselves cancer
patients, to present evidence, and he considered their
evidence in arriving at his conclusion.
We suggest that there's another reason why the
grandfather's alauise does not apply, because the only
labelling of the drug before 1952 was for investigational use
only and not for commercial use; it was labelled to instruct
physicians who were conducting experiments in its use, and

1©

as such it did not qualify for the grandfather’s clausa.
Finally, we say that the District Court employed an
improper standard of review by overturning the Commissioner’s
finding of fact.
There was evidence to support everyone of the
Commissioner's findings.

We submit that it was his right to do

this, and that the District Court improperly invaded the
province of the adminsltrative agency in making these findings.
Finally, we would address the constitutional issue.
In the first place w© say that the asserted right of privacy
which would give a terminal patient the right to use this drug
is premised upon something that is not so.
It is premised on the unwarranted belief that laetrile
has been shown to be non-toxic.

And we submit that the

record shows clearly that it is toxic.

And if it is, the

entire premise for this determination is destroyed, and the
conclusion should fall.
QUESTION:

Is that just true if taken orally?

GENERAL KcCREEs

It is certainly trua if taken

orally, and there is no adequate investigation of its
consequences when taken by injection.
QUESTION:

So you can't say

then that

it’s not

toxic?
GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTIONs

You cranlt say that it’s not toxic.

Well, you can't say that it is, either.

GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION:

And the Tenth Circuit's order—

GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION:

That is correct

But the—the conclusion--

--the Tenth Circuit'3 order is limited to

intravenous—?
GENERAL McCREE:
two things from that:

It is so limited, and we suggest

First, the limitation that was gratuitous

indicates that the Court of Appeals recognised the tonicity
when taken orally; but we also suggest that it is his premise
that a person has a constitutional right to use a non-toxic
drug.

And it would appear then that if there is no evidence of

toxicity or not, that his conclusion failsg particularly when
the drug is shown to be toxic in on© form, and it is clear that
one of its components is a deadly poison, and no one knows
whether it is released in tha--when taken parenterally, when
injected instead of ingested.
Wa also suggest that

;his Court in discussing the

right of privacy, has not extended it beyond protecting the
individual interest and making independent decisions in
matters relating to marriage, procreation, family relationships
and

bearing and education.
.

In Whalen v. Roe this Court, at 429 U.S«, page 600,

in footnote 26, said expressly that the right of privacy did
not extend to the drugs that, ware involved there that were

18

subject to potential abuse.
We also suggest that the Court has made it clear
that even in these protected areas the right of a person not to
b© regulated might be restricted in the interests of
protecting the health of the person concerned.
W® point to the abortion cases, the case that
involved th© saline amniocentesis method of abortion, where
the Court said that this wasn't--the prohibition there
wasn't to protect the health of the woman, but it was for a
different purpose and improper purpose.
And here the concern, if for th© health, would not
b© prohibited.
Also we suggest that historically the exercise of
the police power to protect pecpl® from harmful drugs or
improperly labelled drugs ie--i:ar antedates the constitution.
When the constitution was adopted, this was a common practice.
In fact, we show in our appendix that it began in 1266.
guess that's 200 years after the Norman Conquest.

continuously in Anglo-American history, public health has

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Coe.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH RAY COE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I think initially it is incumbent upon me to
discuss with you briefly the limitations that are imposed
inherently in this c#ee by the lower courts' rulings.
This case applies only to a class of terminally ill
cancer patients, which are represented in this case by Mr.
i-«v — •”

Glen Rutherford.

It applies only to the application of the

substance known as laetrile.

It applies only to the intra­

venous application of that particular substance.

And it

applies to application of that substance only under the
care of

&

super--excuse me, of a supervising doctor.
This case has nothing at all--no content other than

that, what I've jurat discussed.

.21

Kfovr the reason 1 mention that is because it has been
asserted in the government's brief, to a large extent, that
this case bodes very ill for the Food and Drug Administration.
And I just do not believe that is the case.

And I do not

believe it's the case when you consider what has happened.
Initially this case was brought in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma by several
cancar patients who were desirous of using laetrile, were in
the terminal state, and almost immediately died.
Mr. Rutherford was brought in as a replacement or
supplemental plaintiff.

And at that point in time we moved

the court for a temporary injunction so that he wouldn't
suffer the same fate as the original plaintiffs.
The District Court granted the injunction just

as

to Mr. Rutherford, which decision was, of course, appealed to
the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
That Circuit made a determination that, in fact,
Mr. Rutherford was entitled to the temporary Injunction, but
that it did not appear to that court that the Food and Drug
Administration had a sufficient record upon xvhlch to base its
new drug determination.
So the case was remanded back to the District Court
and a hearing was held before that District Court.

At that

point in time, Judge Bohannon asked the attorneys for the
Food and Drug Administration what administrative record had

22

been compiled to determine that laefcrile was a new drug or
that it was not grandfathered by provisions of the *62 amendments
or the "38 amendments.
The government attorney stipulated in court at that
time--it's a matter of record--that they had no record
exclusive of one affidavit which had been prepared by a
Pood and Drug Administration medical doctor.
Judge Bohanon then remanded the case to the Food and
Drug Administration, so that a proper administrative record
could be compiled on which he could base some decision and
th© Tenth Circuit could has© some decision as to authenticity
of the Administrator's findings.
The Food ar.d Drug Administration then held this
rulemaking proceeding.

And we've contended throughout this

litigation that the rulemaking proceeding that the FDA
conducted was not proper under the circumstances.
QUESTION:
Court, Mr. Coa?

How did this case got to the District

It--wes it originally an application for

administrative review?
MRo COE:

No, lour Honor, it was a complaint filed
N

in the United States District

Court for the Western

District of Oklahoma oh behalf of terminally ill cancer
patients alleging that the Food and Drug Administration by
virtu® of a determination that laafcrile v?as a new drug had
effectively prohibited their us a of the drug and there is

23

authority for that; X believe that's Weinberger v. Hynson,
Westcott & Dunning? that after the Food and Drug Administration
has made its initial determination, that a District Court may
then review.
QUESTION;

So it was an application for administra­

tive review under the-MR. COE:

Yes, Your Honor, I guess you'd have to call

it that.
QUESTION:

But it went forward just on the admini­

strative record?
MR. COE:

Your Honor, it's been backwards and

forwards.
QUESTION:

Yes, but X mean, has it finally got to--

finally, before Judge Bohanon, it--he proceeded on the
administrative record.
MR. COE:
QUESTION:
MR. COE:

Yes, Your Honor.
No isaw evidence?
No new evidence was heard.

The administrativa record that was compiled, which
was ordered by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, was ordered
to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act, Section 554(c)
Within that subsection it requires that cross-examination be
allowed to the proponents and to the ether side in the case.
Now, the Food and Drug Administration selected the
most informal proceeding of the variety of proceedings it could

24
possibly hold, and in fact, allowed witnesses to testify
without the administration of an oath, or without the
opportunity of cross-examination to determine the veracity of
any of those witnesses.
Now, that was so even though an objection was made
to th® Hearing Examiner at the time to that particular type
of proceeding.
The-QOESTXON s

You say the Administrative Procedure

Act prohibits that?
MR. COE:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I missed that?
You say that the Administrative Procedure

Act prohibits that?
MR. COE:

No, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals

required that the FDA conduct proceedings pursuant to 554(c)
of the Administrative Procedure Act.
QUESTION:

So that you say that 554(c) prohibited

the sort of proceedings conducted by the Food and Drug
Administration?
MR. COS:

Actually, sir, that refers to 556,

which grants the right of cross-examination.
QUESTION:

So indirectly you say it's--whafc th®

FDA did here is prohibited by the Administrative Procedure
Act?
MR. COE:

By that, and as it was espoused by the

25

Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Well, you know, X presume the Tenth

Circuit has the right to construe the statute, but not to
impose its own requirements.
MR, COE:

The PDA also has proceedings in whicf,

generally speaking, whan a court sends a case to it for
review.

And generally speaking, those requirements are for

a more formal type of hearing.

That’s in addition to the

reqirements of the Tenth Circuit.
That was not mat in this case.
QUESTION:

Now, the argument--

la that part of the APA?

Is that part of

the Administrative-MR. COE:

No, it's part of the regulations for the

their procedures.

That's cited in our brief.

At any rate, the FDA did hold its proceedings, and
the Commissioner did issue findings, just as the Solicitor
General advised the Court.
This was then appealed to the District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma.

Judge Bohanon examined the

entire administrative record, and based on his review of
that record, made a determination that the entire proceedings
were arbitrary, capricious, and abused discretion, and not
in accordance with law.
He based that upon several things.

First he mad® a

of a notice filed in the Federal Register, espoused the
same continuing view toward laetrile as it had been espousing
for many years since the 1950s; the same entrenched position.

Your Honor, I think that is exactly the

point the judge was making.

The FDA has made its decision,

has made its decision back in 1950 before it had any admini­
strative record whatsoever; and continues to make the same.
He used that particular item to show that there was
a lack of in~dapth fact finding in the admir,istrative
proceedings.

They simply weren't open even to

persuasion by new evidence?

Your Honor, I know it in my own mind.
Go ahead and think.
All right.

I think, Your Honor, that the

Tenth Circuit found that the Act did not apply to terminally
ill cancer patients, because it would be ridiculous to apply
the term "efficacy” to a terminally ill cancer patient?
QUESTION:

Why?

Aren’t there pain-relieving

properties in some drugs that could ba used on terminally ill
patiantB?

MR. COE:

Your Honor, many of the drugs that are

used on terminally ill cancer patients do in fact have pa n
killing effects, and generally speaking, that's—
QUESTION:

And isn't that th« function of this

agency, this regulatory body, to see that any--any pain
relieving drugs are safe and meet all the other standards?
MR. COE:

It is the duty of the Food and Drug

Administration to fulfill its Congressional mandate.

And it

is our position before the Court that the Congressional
mandate, which added "efficacy" in particular to the Food and
Drug A at which came out after the thalidomide tragedies,
does not have application to terminally ill cancer patients.
And the reasoning behind that Is very simply that
if in fact there were an effective cancer remedy, then you

31

wouldn't have

terminal cancer patients.

They'd foe terminal

from some other cause entirely.
And as long asyou do not have an effective cancer
remedy, that to require that of iaetril® is an absurd result
from the Act.
QUESTION:
question that even a

Well, what about theChief Justice's

I do not know what the

Court would do with some other kinds.
QUESTION:
MR. COE:

What's your position on that?
My position, as it always has been, is

that we have terminal cancer patients desiring to us© laetriXa.
\

This case has brought that particular issue before the Court.

Th® Tenth Circuit did not decide that.
So that-~fcufc you would taka the position

wants it?
MR» COE:

It is ray understanding, totally outside of

anything I know from this case, that in England heroin and
\'

f

soma other opiates are being used for terminally ill cancer
patients.

And the reason it's being used is because they're

terminal? there’s nothing that can be done to help them, and
it will take them off some of the really mind-deadening
drugs.
So, to that axtent—
QUESTION:

Could I suggest you stay with the

microphones when you answer questions.
MR. COE:

I’m sorry, Your Honor.

I would like to address if X may next the consti­
tutional aspects in this particular case.

The lower court,

the District Court, found that to deny the use of laetril© to
terminally ill cancer patients violated their right to
privacy.
The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals did not rule on
this issue, and as the Court has been informed, neither did
it rule on the issue of the grandfather clause.

34

As to the constitutional issue, the argument, the
decision of the District

Court was made that this Court’s

decision in Roe v. Wade and likewise in Doe v. Bolton, both
abortion cases, justified the extension of a right to
privacy to a health care context.
Now, as we’va briefed,sit is the position of the
respondents that the intent and spirit of both Doe v. Bolton
and Roe v. Wade established that they are in a health care
context.

For instance, the health of the mother in Roe v.

Wade is mentioned ovar and over again, and in Doe v. Belton,
Justice Douglas, of course, Mr. Justice Douglas in his
concurring opinion enumerated the right to care for one’s
own health as a fundamental right.
It is our position that if in fact the right

to

health care, to mahe a determination as to the care of one’s
own body under medical supervision is a fundamental right in
fact, then the petitioner-~well, the respondents in this case,
the palintiffs bslow--have

&

right to use laatrile under the

court ’ s orders, and within the court's limitations

as they

had previously been enunciated.
Now, in order to overcome this, the Food and Drug
Administration must establish a compelling Stata interest.
And in this case, that compelling State interest has been
enunciated as more of a desire to maintain a system than to
reach the merits ©f the issue.

35

QUESTION:

Mr. Coe, you seem to concede that the

constitutional right would not exist without the doctor's
supervision?
Or do you?

Is it only a constitutional right to taka

this drug in a particular *<?ay if a doctor supervises it?
MR. COE:

Your Honor, X have only argued

within

that context, because that, is within th© aontext of the lower
court's decision, and outside of that, I don't think-QUESTION:

But if you acknowledge that the State can

impose regulatory control for the safety even of the terminally
ill cancer patient, by saying the doctor has to supervise it,
i
__ jt
i
why would hot the constitution also give the State the power
,

to say, w ©LI, certain kinds of drugs, heroin, marijuana,
whatever it might be, laetrile, cannot be used for these
people?
What's the difference between a flat rule agairst
a particular kind of drug and a condition that the doctor
approves of, in terms of constitutional terms?
MR. COE:

I think it's somewhat analogous to the

decision in Roe v. Wade, in which this Court made a
determination that during the first trimester of pregnancy,
because of the facts and circumstances adduced, that there
was no justification for a compelling State interest, and
that therefore, an abortion may b© had without any intersfc
of the State at all.

36

And then, after that particular point in time, the
compelling State interest came into play.

And I think in this

case, it's the same thing.
In this case, if you have a patient who is not
terminal, who has not been diagnosed as such by his doctor,
and to be lad away from possibly useful orthodox therapy to
laetrils—
QUESTION:

Well, 1 was assuming for the purpose of

my question that they had all been diagnosed as terminally
ill by the doctor.
But then the question is, why do they need doctor's
supervision to take the drug any more than they need--why is
that anymore acceptable than an FDA approval of the particu­
lar drug to be taken.
MR, COE:

Your Honor, that was the decision rendered by

the Tenth Circuit that they had to la to medical care.

I

personally, "and the patients in this case, are of the opinion
that they should bo subject to medical care, because they're
in a very bad condition and they need continuing supervision.
Now, as to what actual legal offset that has as to
the constitutional argument-QUESTION:

Whatif they lived in a--what if Oklahoma

had a State rule that said that a doctor would be guilty of
malpractice if he prescribes laetril® which has not been
approved by the FDA?

37

Would that-“I suppose that rule would be uncon­
stitutional in your view?
MR. COE:

Yaa, Your HOnor.

As a matter of fact,

Oklahoma is one of the 19 States that I believe now has
legalised the use of laetrile.
The decision of the District Court, in relation to the
constitutional issue, has been pretty well explained up to
this point.
Basically, it is the right to privacy, as enunciated
J

in Roq v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, the fact that there is no

compelling

State interest whan the case is considered in the

terms of terminal cancer patients who have been declared by
their doctors to have passed that stage where they're going
through death's door.
In their application, in their instance, there ie
no possible application of a compelling State interest that
could havean effect.
As’ to people who have not been designated as terminal
cancer patients, as to those who might have some other help,
then the compelling state interest might come in, and there is
no problem in this particular case in rendering a decision to
that effect.
I'd like to address the decision by the Tenth Circuit
Court of Appeals before I finish, if it please the Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coe, at this point, you've always

spoken of the doctor.
physician?

Do you mean by that a medical

Would it cover a chiropractor, an osteopath, a

naturopath?
MR. COEs

As a mafcfcsr of fact, Your Honor, th©

District Court, in one of its previous orders in which it
instituted the affidavit system, which is a system in which
the individual to obtain laetrile has to have an affidavit
from his doctor to demonstrate that he is in fact a aeabe.i
of th© class.
Judge Bchanon limited it to medical doctors, M„D„s,
and I do not—
QUESTIONs

What is your position on that?

MR* COE:

Thatis my position. Your Honor.

The Tenth Circuit's ruling, which was mad© to a
certain extent, or completely, without any authority in
support, of it, made a determination that laetrile should be
used by terminal cancer patients, and could be, for the
reason that the term safe and effective did not have any
meaning to terminal cancer patients.
As to effective, as I've already said, I certainly
agree.

Ther© is no efficacious treatment for cancer.
QUESTION:

Is th© act contrary?

MR. COE:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

QUESTION:
MRc COE:

Is there support in the Act for that?
That it does not apply?

39

QUESTION s
MR» COE s

Yes.
There is no support in the Act itself.

The Act is flat out, adds terms, requirements for
effeicacy.

safety and

The Administrator, the Commissioner of Eood and

Drugs has had to apply the Acts and therefore has added an
administrative gloss to it.
But there is nothing in either the Act nor the
administrative gloss which gives

an exemption for terminally

ill cancer patients, with the exception of common sense.

And

I believe that's what the Tenth Circuit was using when it
made its decision.
QUESTION:

You didn' t-*-thls wasn't your position in

the Tenth Circuit?
MR. COEs

It was not.

The Tenth Circuit opinion found the "safe" and
"effective" did not have meaning for terminal cancer patients.
Terminal, it is submitted to this Court, does not have
meaning--or efficacious does not have meaning for terminal
cancer patients.
The term "safety" for terminal cancer patients can,
in affect, have no more meaning than non-toxic.

And I

think the record amply demonstrates that laatrile is nontoxic.

I think it demonstrates it's non-toxic both as to

liquid and to tablets, but based on the Tenth Circuit's
opinion, the argument is made at this time that it is non-toxic

40

as to the liquid form.only.
The record ia replete with that.

The judges--the

lower courts' decision is replete with that.
If there are no questions, I have no-QUESTION:

I take it the Solicitor General heartily

disagrees with that statement.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coe, I have one other question.

Your constitutional argument, you make the same
argument—’would it apply equally to one who is not a terminally
ill cancer patient?
MR, COE:

I wonder why.
The reason I say it would not, Your

Honor, is because in this particular instance the State has
a legitimate interest in controlling-™
QUESTION:
MR. COE:
QUESTION:

But .if it's non-toxic.
Pardon?
But if it's non-toxic, I don’t know

it wouldn't apply equally.
MR, COE:

I do not disagree, nor does this case

disagree, nor does the lower courts' opinions, disagree with
the Act--with the Food and Drug Act or the intent of it as to
safety and efficacy.
The disagreement is that those two terms have been
very rigidly stricfcured by the Food and Drug Administration

41

to not allow what should be a very obvious exclusion or an
exception from the Act.
In this case, we do not- object to the fact that it
is limited.

Tile plaintiff's class is composed of terminally

ill cancer patients, and that's all the case is before the
Court.
QUESTION:

Of course if it is under the 1962
•/

grandfather clause, then it's permissible for use by anybody?
MR. COE:

That's correct, Your Honor.
