ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. HARMON
i

,

ESQ»

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR, HARMONs

Mr» Chief Justices, may it please the

Courts
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia»
The question presented is whether the National Environmental
Policy Act requires executive agencies to prepare environmental
impact statements for their annaul budget estimates submitted to
OMB for consideration in the preparation of the President5 s
Budget»

Section 1022(c) of NEPA provides that all agencies
shall include an environmental impact statement in every
recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and
other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment»
Respondents brought this action in July, 1974
against the Secretary of Interior and the Director of OMB
alleging that the members of their respective organizations
were adversely affected in their use of the national wildlife
refuge system by certain proposals by the Department of
Interior and OMB for the operation and maixxtenance of the refuge

3

system»
Respondents claimed that the annual budget request
prepared by the Secretary of the Interior and submitted to OMB
were proposals for legislation and other major federal action
within the meaning of the National Environmental Protection
Act and, therefore, required the preparation of environmental
impact statements»
to this effect»

Respondents sought a declaratory judgment

They also sought a declaration that NEPA

requires OMB to prepare procedures and guidelines to identify
budget submissions by other agencies which require the prepara”
tion of environmental impact statements»
The District Court granted Respondents8 Motion for
Summary Judgment, holding that every budget estimate of an
agency whose activities significantly impact on the environment
is a proposal for legislation and other major federal action»
QUESTION?

I suppose, Mr» Harmon, that some of the

actions of the 400 plus District judges in the United States
and well over 100 Circuit judges, to say nothing of other
judges, might have an impact on the human environment»

Does

that mean the judicial budget would have to have ah impact
statement?
MR» HARMONs

Mr» Chief Justice, in the sense of the

theory in this case that in fact the actions, a decision would
necessitate action below that may be major federal action
significantly affecting the environment.

On that theory, again,

4
that would be the follow through,,

However, the environmental

impact statement requirements of NEPA do not apply to the
Judicial Branch or to the President»

It is our contention that

they apply to all agencies — executive agencies — within the
Executive Branch.
QUESTION%

But the thrust of my question was partly

that impact is really pretty difficult to measure, isn9t it,
to define and to bound»
MR. HARMON:

Well, that is certainly our contention.

In the sense that the argument made by Respondents throughout
this case, indeed adopted by the District Court, was that the
budget estimates submitted by an agency in fact were proposals
for all the actions which would be financed by the appropria­
tion and that, in that sense, the budget decision was a de­
cision to take those major federal actions with the significant
environmental impact»

And that is the broad reading that the

District Court, in fact, accepted in this case»
The District Court ordered, directed the Secretary
of Interior and the Director of OMB to prepare and consider
environmental impact statements for each annual budget request
for the National Wildlife Refuge System.

In addition, the

District Court held that NEPA requires OMB to prepare pro­
cedures to identify all budget estimates which require an
environmental impact statement»
QUESTION?

Do you understand this holding to be for

5
the presumed benefit of the agencies who are submitting their
Requests to OMB or for 0MB in submitting its recommendations
to the President?
MR. HARMONj

It is our understanding of the holding,

Your Honor, that it is, in fact, for the benefit of the
identification for the agencies who will be submitting their
requests to 0MBc

That is the point at which the Respondents

have sought the filing of an environmental impact statement.
The Court below did not discuss the submission of OMB to the
President for the consideration of the budget.
QUESTION?

Do you get any sense that the Respondents

have taken “a new look® at their position from their brief in
this Court?
MR. HARMONs

Your Honor, that is our contention, the

contention we have made in the reply brief which we have
filed before this Court.

In fact, we think that the application

of the environmental impact statement requirement to

a

submission by OMB in its function, in its budget function and
the parts of OMB which provide and specifically establish for
the purpose of providing advice and information to the President
in the preparation of the President's Budget are, in fact, beyond the reach of NEPA.

And, for that reason, that application

would raise a new issue in this case.
The Court of Appeals rejected the District Court's
per se rule that every budget request is proposal for legislatio^

6

Instead, the Court of Appeals adopted its own per se rule that
every budget estimate, every budget request which is taken
after a new look and in depth programmatic review of a
program or which involved a significant change in the status
quo in the current level of funding that those budget estimates1
were, in fact, proposals for legislation»
QUESTIONS

However-”*»

What is your position as to that?

MR» HARMOMs

It is our position that, one, these are

not proposals? that the budget estimate submitted by~
QUESTION?

Suppose we hold they are, then what?

MR» HARMON?

Even if — even if the budget estimate

is found by this Court to be a proposal within the meaning
of the Act, it is our position that they are not a proposal
for legislation»

It is our position that Congress observed

the traditional distinction that is maintained between
legislation and appropriations and did not intend to reach
proposals for appropriations, as distinguished from legislation»
QUESTION?

I think I follow you with respect to a

positive proposal to build a dam»

But suppose that Interior

has already established an ongoing program for wildlife
refuge and suppose then that the word comes down to cut
Interior's budget by 10 percent and so they reflect this in
their budget request by eliminating funds for that particular
program»

If a statement is not required there, it never will

be required

7
MR□ HARMONi
QUESTION?

Your Honor*
I am drawing a distinction between a

positive action and a negative one,,
MR3 HARMONs

And I appreciate your point»

Our posi­

tion on that is that the first, in the real sense, the
budget decision a 10 percent cut on a particular program*
the decision is made the budget — the appropriations decision*
the funding decision, the economic decision and the political
decision made by the President as to what the shape and content
of his budget will be, that is made first»

The implementation

of that decision must await, of course, the approval by the
full Congress of that appropriation request but in the real
sense there is no concrete, in most instances, there is no
concrete proposal with respect to what Interior will do with
this program or that program, whether it will not complete
this dam or will cut enforcement personnel in another area»
Those decisions in the main, in the real sense, are made
subsequent to the budget decision — the paper decision»

The

decision to which you refer, the action, the major Federal
action, if it might be determined to be so, is an underlying
action, an underlying project, an underlying decision,

We

acknowledge, as we must, that, in fact, the underlying project
beginning or ending might, in fact, require an environmental
impact statement, depending upon analysis of the given
situation — the given factual situation,

But it is the

8

underlying project, the underlying action and not the
appropriation which is the major Federal action under the
statute»
The Court of Appeals in this case again subsequent
to the District Court’s decision, the Department of Interior
did prepare a detailed policy review of the Refuge System
0

Program»

The Court of Appeals had that review before it and

held that this programmatic review satisfied the Government’s
current obligations under NEPA with respect to the annual
budget request for the National Wildlife Refuge System»

How­

ever, the Court of Appeals added and held that in the event
of any significant change in the status quo or any reevaluation
of the Refuge Program, the environmental impact statement
requirements would apply anew.
The Court of Appeals went on to affirm that part of
the District Court’s decision that NEPA does require OMB to
formulate procedures to identify the agency, the annual agency
estimates which must be accompanied by an environmental impact
statement»

As I have tried to outline, we would make three

arguments to support our position that the judgment below
should be reversed?
The first, as I have again attempted to describe
is that the annual budget estimate submitted to OMB for
consideration in the preparation of the President’s budget
is not a proposal, as that term is used in NEPA»

In the

9

Executive Budget process* the point at which there is a
proposal* a formal proposal* as that term was defined by this
Court's decision in Klepps v, Sierra Club_

is when the

*

president submits his budget to the Congress* the annual
budget estimates which are prepared by the agencies submitted
to OMB in September for consideration in the preparation of
the President's Budget are but part of the germination process
leading to the final proposal* again the President's Budget,
Respondents argued that these budget estimates are
final proposals because the agency ~ no further action is
required by the Agency,

But the fact that the Agency may

have had its last word on a budget proposal* a budget estimate
does not make that a final proposal.

Indeed* Congress has

vested in the President the exclusive statutory authority
to prepare and submit to the Congress the budget.
the bud&t in tha Accounting Act in 1921,

That was

In that same

statute Congress espressly prohibited the agencies from sub»
raitting independent budgets to the Congress,
Since the agencies neither have the authority*
indeed they are expressly precluded from submitting these
budget estimates to the Congress* those estimates can only be
part of the process of the development of a final proposal*
the President's Budget,
QUESTIONS

Would you analogize this* Mr, Harmon* to

the process which a division of a Department submits to the

10

head of a Department? where the Department itself submits the
total budget request to the OMB?
MRa HARMON %

Mr. Chief Justice? it would be exactly

our point that if the Respondent's contention were correct
that the fact that the agency has had its final word? its
last say that no further action is required by the agency?
if that made this a final proposal? then? as you suggest?
and that's the way the budget process works from the field
office? from the person located in charge of an individual
refuge area all the way up at each level of review with a
broader perspective? that at each level there would be a
\

final proposal? if that were the law»
QUESTIONS
MR. HARMONs
QUESTIONS

Or at least a proposal?
That is correct.
You keep putting the word “final" in

there ~* final proposal
MR. HARMONs

the statute doesn't use that.

The statute does not use that? Your

Honor? but this Court used that phraseology in Klepp®
its decision in Kleppe v. Sierra Club a

in

In that case? as

here? at various stages there is contemplated action.,

There

is input from the various sectors of an agency? and in our
case the various sectors of the Government? of the Executive
Branch of the Government„

And those suggestions? consideration

discussions are part of what the Court described as the
germination process to produce a final proposal.

11
Our position is that in this case only the President,
only the President has the authority to make a final pro­
posal,

And, in fact, he will, does, can revise, change the

budget proposals as they come to him.
QUESTIONS

Of course, I must confess for me the

word ^proposal68 wreaks of something that is not final.
QUESTIONS

Well, is it final as it goes up to the

Congress from the President?
MR, HARMON%

In that sense, the proposal in that

sense, that gives us a good context in which to consider the
finality of a proposal.

The proposal itself as it goes to the

Congress, of course, is not final.

Our Constitution, returning,

to the first principles, does vest in the Congress the power
to lay taxes, and appropriate monies.
QUESTIONS

When does the proposal become final?

MR. HARMONs
QUESTION?
Congress acts.

The proposal becomes final—
I assume you're going to say that

It's no longer a proposal then.

MR, HARMONs
not our position.

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is

The proposal—

QUESTIONS

Well, is it your position that you don't

need any statements until after you get to Congress?
MR. HARMONs
QUESTION %
the statement?

No, it is our position—
Well, when would you be obliged to file

12
MR» HARMON;

It is our position that we would not be

obliged to file a statement,»
QUESTIONS

Ever®

Do you mean that nobody will ever

have to file a statement?
MRo HARMON;
QUESTION;

For the budget, right»
That®s your position?

MR» HARMON;

That1s our position»

If the budget, for

example, appropriates money to build three dams, twelve
nuclear power stations, the action would have to be considered
the action would have to be considered at the time it was
taken, the major Federal action to be considered is that
underlying decision, that implementation, that spending of
the money»

At that time, we acknowledge that there might

very well be required an environmental impact statement»
QUESTION;
all?

Why do you use the word “proposal59 at

According to you, you don't need any impact statements

on any proposals»

Isn't that your position?

MR» HARMON;

No, Your Honor, it is not»

The statute

states that a proposal for major Federal action, a proposal
for rulemaking, for example, that does have a significant
impact-"»
QUESTION;

Now, the Department of Interior

wants

to propose that you build a dam and somebody from Congress
suggests that, and eventually it gets to Congress, and
Congress adopts it, now all I am asking you is when is that

13
a proposal and when is it not?
MRo HARMON:

On this one item,

When the Secretary of Interior proposes,

and let's suppose it is a proposal to build a dam, a piece of
substantive legislation seeking the authorization to build the
dam, that proposal could be a proposal for legislation which
would significantly affect the human environments
QUESTIONS

When does it need the impact statement?

MR, HARMONs

When?

When the Secretary of Interior

has formulated, has before him a proposal and before he
finalizes that proposal there may be at that point the
requirement of an environmental impact statement»
QUESTION^

What would be required in order to

require the impact statement in the Interior Department?
MRo HARMON:
QUESTION:

That would be a proposal for legislation,
Well, what would make it a proposal?

The word “proposal®1?
MR» HARMON:

The fact the Secretary of Interior had

a final plan before him, a final proposal»
QUESTION:

Are all final plans proposals?

MR0 HARMON:

If they are proposals for legislation,

yes, Your Honor0
QUESTION:

All final plans for legislation are pro­

posals under this Act?
MR0 HARMON:

If, in fact, they will be proposed by

yes, yes, I think that would be my position»

14
QUESTIONS

Now I am really confused0

QUESTION?

In this particular legislation* a

Committee of the Congress* or the Congress as a whole* when
any legislative proposal is submitted by any Department can
say prepare an impact statement or we aren't going to hold any
hearingsp
MR» HARMON3
QUESTIONg

Absolutely correct* Your Honor»
They could do that at every stage while

they are considering the legislation* couldn't they?
MR» HARMONs

That is our position and that goes to

the question of the appropriateness of judicial intervention
in a process where Congress has before it the means* as it
always has* to require the information that it needs to make
its decisionso

And it also raises the question of whether*

in fact* the imposition of an environment 1 impact statement
requirement at this stage might interfere with the ability of
Congress to obtain the information* the candid views* the
frank opinion of the members of the Executive Branch who are
appearing before an Appropriations Subcommittee to respond to
questions because not all proposals for Federal funding come
from the Executive Branch»
just at that stage»

In fact* many* many are interjected

The Subcommittee* the Appropriations

Subcommittee* with the idea* with the constituent with the
interest group* with the proposal that appears before the
Committee makes that proposal beyond the President's Budget»

15
And there* again* the Congress will be considering that pro™
posal and will be seeking the advice and opinions of the
Executive Branchy the Department of Interior»
QUESTION;
particular Act?

Suppose Congress doesn't do it in a

Would it violate this statute?

I didn't

say Congress did* I said did the Department of Interior do
it?

I don't understand it was whether Congress asked for

something»
MR» HARMON;

No* Your Honor,

It is our position that

this Act does not apply to the budget process»
QUESTION;
MR» HARMON;

At all»
That Congress did not intend it to

apply»
QUESTION;

Well* Congress could have said that*

couldn't they* very easily?
MR» HARMON;
QUESTION;
MR» HARMON;

That is our position exactly»
But Congress didn't say that?
Congress didn't say that* and there is

nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress
considered this Act as applying to the budget process»

Further

more* it is inconceivable to imagine that Congress* aware of
the significant disruptive impact that such a requirement
would have on the Executive and Congressional budget process
would have imposed this requirement without discussion»
Congress* when Congress seeks information from

seeks

Indeed

16

additional budget information,, it has traditionally done so
by amending the Budget and Accounting Act»
1S50 " -

It was done in

58g, and as recently as 6 74? after the passage —

after the passage of NEPA»

Again? with those amendments?

the Congressional Budget Act of 1974? no mention—
QUESTIONS

In order to maintain your position? you

don9t have to go so far as to say all budgetary items are
immunized? do you?
MR» HARMONs

Our position is that all budgetary items?

that the budget process is not covered? and is not subject
to the environmental impact statement requirements»
Our third argument? the response to a contention by
Respondents that there is an alternative basis for upholding
the decision of the Court below? the Court of Appeals in this
case? they argue that the budget estimates are not only
proposals for legislation? but they are also proposals for
major federal action»

Their argument is that at the time an

agency puts together its proposed proposal? its budget
estimates? that at that time it is making a decision? a
proposal for all the major — all the actions? all the
Federal actions that will be funded by that Appropriation»
The District Court agreed with that proposition»
The Court of Appeals rejected it on the grounds it would lead
to the absurd result that every budget estimate? every budget
estimate would require an environmental impact statement»

17
QUESTIONS

In zero budgeting I guess it would0

QUESTIONS

That approach»

MRo HARMON:

Your Honor,- it is our submission that

the logic of that position is necessarily that*, with all the
actions that are funded by each budget appropriation that?
in fact* it would apply practically to all agencies and all
budget proposals»
Mr» Justice, I would like to reserve additional time
for rebuttal®
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS

Mr, Cohen,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H» COHEN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. COHENs Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Courts

The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 is this

Nation®s charter for the protection of the environment»

The

action forcing mechanisms in Section 1022(c) of NEPA are
intended to serve an invaluable management tool for the pur­
poses of Agency decision-making»

By so doing, NEPA has, over

the course of time, actually reduced cost and mitigated
adverse affects on the environment by increasing the planning
process during the development of Agency proposals for either
legislation or proposals for major Federal actiona
This case involves the plain language of NEPA,
Section 1022(c), and indicates that every Agency is to use all
practicable means at the earliest possible stage in decision­
making and to the fullest extent possible in incorporating

18

NEPA into its decision-making process»

Under the terms of

this Court's opinion in Flint Ridge, the Court has indicated
that unless there is an express prohibition or unless
compliance is impossible with NEPA, NEPA and the action
forcing requirements of the environmental impact statement
\

are intended to apply to that»

NSPA0s language, the legisla­

tive history of the Act, the consistent and contemporaneous
interpretations by the Council on Environmental Quality for
nearly a decade—
QUESTION?

Let me ask you a question, Mr. Cohen, if

I may, about the regulations by

the CEQ.

Congress did not

grant the CEQ authority to issue rules and regulations
interpreting the substantive provisions of the Act, did it?
MR, COHEN?

That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

Under the terms of NEPA, CEQ was created and under the terms
of two separate Executive Orders issued by the President,
CEQ was empowered to develop guidelines and ultimately
regulations implementing and interpreting NEPA.
QUESTION?

But that authority stems from an Executive

Order* and not from an Act of Congress?
MR. COHEN?

That is correct, Your Honor, except

insofar as CEQ itself was directed under the terms of NEPA
to assist in Agency decision-making in terms of the
interpretations for implementing NEPA.
terms of Section 1022(b) of the Act.

I am speaking now in

19
QUESTION?

Do you think that8s the same thing as

the authority Congress has conferred on some agencies to
issue rules and regulations interpreting the meaning of the
legislative section itself?
MRo COHEN?

We certainly feel, Your Honor, that the

ability by CEQ to prepare these guidelines and regulations
has at least the

same authority as those which would emanate

from the Congresse

CEQ was created under NEPA.

It implemented

regulations through two separate Executive Orders and perhaps
more importantly this Court has given deference to agency
regulations, including the Council on Environmental Quality0
QUESTION?

You are relying on an Executive Order,

yet the Executive Branch is here arguing against you.
MR. COHEN?

That is correct. Your Honor, insofar as

the authority for CEQ to actually interpret the Act, that
is correct.

We are relying on the Executive Order and, as I

indicated, the inherent authority under NEPA itself.
QUESTION?

Is CEQ still of the view that you

suggest?
MR. COHEN?
QUESTION?
MR. COHEN?

CEQ is not still of the view, Mr. Justice.
Which view do we give deference to?
Well, it is our contention, as I have

indicated, Your Honor, that the deference ought to be accorded
to 8 years of consistent and contemporaneous Interpretation—
QUESTION?

So if this suit had come up 10 years from

20

now you would give deference to the most recent one?
MR, COHENs

We are concerned, as' we have indicated,

Your Honor, that the interpretations are without any reasonable
basis insofar as under the new interpretation they provide
an express exclusion for budget requests from the definition
of legislationo-

Now, under the previous three sets of

guidelines from the Council on Environmental Quality, the
definition of legislation was not provided.

In point of fact,

there was a definition of actions which incorporated explicitly
the terms of budget requests, including appropriations
requests.

And we believe that this consistent interpretation,

particularly in view of the General Electric Case

which

Mr, Justice Rehnquist wrote, indicate that there is no new
development, that there is no new source of*—
QUESTION?

Is it correct or not that CEQ now is

before this Court^ through the United States, indicating
that these requests should not be within the reach of NEPA?
MR, COHENs

I believe CEQ has indicated in its

regulations themselves that it felt that the budget process—
QUESTION?

Which view is essentially being represented

here by the United States?
MR, COHENs

I believe that is correct, Your Honor,

The critical importance oil the budget process itself
in Federal agency decision-making, we feel ought not to be
underestimated.

The legislative history of the budget process

'

21
indicates quite clearly, we believe, that the action-forcing
mechanism of budget allocations and resource decisions at the
agency level which go on for nearly 10 months represent a
significant stage in agency decision-making«>

In point of

fact, the legislative history has indicated that the budget
process represents the judgment book by which agencies live
and by which agencies die,

And feel that under those

circumstances the critical process whereby a decision comes
from the agency in the form of a proposal to OMB and ultimately
for legislation or major Federal action to the Congress
represents an appropriate stage under the terras of Kleppe
where the proposal has reached a stage of sufficient maturity
and sufficient definiteness to be accorded the weight that
it should be accorded in the form of an EIS,
Q

And what about 0MB's proposals to the President

or recommendations?
MR, COHENs

Well, under the terms of the Budget and

Accounting Act, Your Honor, you will recall that the President"
QUESTIONS

Thank you»

MR, COHENs

Excuse me, Your Honor,

QUESTION!

Iam sure I don't recall,

MR, COHENs

The President transmits the budget to

the Congress whereas under Section 206 — 201, rather, of
the Act, the agency head is required to prepare the budget.
And this preparation goes on for some 10 months.

And we

22

believe that by the time it has reached the stage where it
is forwarded to OMB-QUESTIONS

I understand that, but what is the next

step after that?
MR, COHEM?

After it goes through OMB, Your Honor, it

then is transmitted to the President—
QUESTIONS

What about that stage?

Because a lot of

changes go on in OMB.
MRo COHEMs
QUESTIONS

That is correct.
Do you think another round of statements?

MR. COHEMs

We certainly do not, Your Honor.

We

feel there is one environmental impact statement is all that
needs to be required.
QUESTION?

It needs to be required.

Well, what if OMB just cancels out a

proposal or decides to shut down an existing program?
MR. COHEN?

Indeed, that represents the particular

instance where an environmental impact statement would be most
needed and most valuable because it would serve—
QUESTION?

I thought you said you didn9t need a

statement supporting an OMB recommendation to the President.
MR. COHEN?

That is correct, Your Honor.

The SIS

would be prepared by the agency—
QUESTION?

Well, I knov; the agency has prepared one —

let’s assume the agency has prepared one and it wants to have
a new program, or it wants to continue an existing program,

23
and the OMB disagrees with it on both counts.

It won’t

start the new program and it won’t continue the old one, does
that decision require—
MR, COHEN s
Honoro

We would submit that it does not* Your

The EIS has served its purpose of assisting in identify­

ing and considering environmental consequences by the time
the forwarding agency which has prepared the budget forwards
its submission to OMB,
QUESTIONS

You don’t argue that an agency that just

wants the same money that it did last year for the same
program needs to prepare an environmental impact statement,,
do you?
MR, COHENs
QUESTION;

Xfm sorry* Your Honor,
Say the Department of Interior has program

X that has been going on for 20 years and every year it is
taking Y dollars and* again* it submits its budget proposal
to OMB* Program X for Y dollars* does that require an EIS?
MR, COHENs

We are supporting the proposition

articulated by the Court of Appeals that only in those
instances where the agency has actually undergone a careful
review of its program and has determined—
QUESTIONS

All right.

So your answer is no to my

question?
MR, COHENs
QUESTIONS

That is correct* Your Honor,
And then it goes to OMB and OMB says

24

we look at this X Program for Y dollars has gone on long
enough? no more X Program for Y dollars.

Now? there is a

—

that's quite a change and it might be eliminating a duck pond
somewhere„
MR. COHENs

It may be? Your Honor? and we would submit,

that so long as the environmental considerations have been
identified and analyzed-QUESTIONS

They have never been.

The agency has

never submitted an EIS on this program. It has been going on
for 20 years.
MR. COHENs

If the program commitment of resources

to the program represents a programmatic course of action
following a review? then we would submit that the agency
forwarding its budget request would have to prepare an EIS.
QUESTIONS

I understand that? but in my example it

did not have to submit one? but the OMB cut the program out?
on its own.

The agency didn't propose it.

that this program has gone on long enough.

OMB just decided
And you say you

still wouldn't need an EIS there?
QUESTIONS

Suppose the program that we are talking

about that Mr. Justice

White has postulated is a program of

$200 million for clean air? and the OMB just cuts it out.
QUESTIONS

Isn't this the question I asked opposing

counsel?
MR. COHENs

Your Honor? the question which Mr. Justice

25
Blackmun addressed to opposing counsel, as I understood it,
was it involved a situation where the forwarding agency had.
determined that it wished to dramatically reduce or to
eliminate a program from its program commitments,,
understand

I did not

the hypothetical which you presented to be one

where the OMB itself-»
QUESTION?

Does it make a difference?

MR» COHENs

We would submit it is — it does make

a difference insofar as the EIS serves in the agency decision­
making process at the budget forwarding level»

Now* if the

Court is suggesting that there may be a proposal which is
made by the Office of Management and Budget in the form of
a dramatic cutback of a program, of course, we would suggest
that that may be the time when there is a proposal»

We have

indicated in our pleadings before the District Court, as well
as in the Court of Appeals, that a proposal is made by the
time it is ■— the budet request is forwarded to the President
of the United States»

We believe that the EIS needs to be

prepared at the time it leaves the forwarding agency and
before it gets to 0MB»
QUESTION?

What you6re saying then is that — you

really said it two ways, it!s a proposal when it goes from
OMB to the President but ites also a proposal when it goes
from the agency to the OMB in the first instance»
MR» COHENs

We would suggest, Your Honor, that it is

26

a proposal by the time it leaves the agency and goes to OMB.
QUESTION?

Mr. Cohen, supposing that the National

Wildlife and Refuge Service proposes a 100 percent increase
in its budget to 0MB so they can acquire a, great deal of new
land for wildlife refuges, under your view, I take it, it
ought to submit an EIS in connection with that.

And then 0MB

says, aTo the contrary, we are going to dissolve NWRS and
sell it off to private investors to build condominiums®, now,
do you need two EXSs, one from the agency and one from 0MB
in that case?
MR. COHENs

We would submit that only one EIS needs

to be prepared.
QUESTION?
MR. COHENs
QUESTIONS

Where?

/

From the agency.
The President might be too busy to know

what the agency proposed.

Then he is going to perhaps be

victimized and the environment victimized by the 0MB.
MR. COHENs

We would submit, Your Honor, that the

preparation of an EIS, even if it were not publicly disclosed
and not made available to comment by the public until the
budget request was submitted to the Congress, at very least
OMB and the President of the United States would have the
benefit of reviewing and determining the environmental
consequences-»-*
QUESTIONS

You don51 really think the President going

27

through budgets which are like several New York telephone
books is going to be able to look at the impact statements
on vejry many of those programs?
MR. COHENt

We would assume* Your Honor* in a very

limited number of instances where an EIS would need to be
prepared under the articulation of the Court of Appeals
opinion* that in those few instances* the President and his
staff would be available to review significant environmental
consequences of a considered programatic review which ushers
in a programmatic course of action»
QUESTION?

Mr. Cohen* is there anything to stop the

President from asking for it* assuming that none — couldn't
he ask for an EIS?
MR» COHENs
QUESTION;
MR. COHENs

I believe—
You believe?
We believe the President certainly could

ask for an EIS.
QUESTIONS

You believe?

Do you have doubt that he

can ask for it?
MR. COHENs
QUESTION?

We have no doubt* Your Honor.
All right.

And it's the same thing*

Congress could ask for it?
MR. COHENs

That is correct, Your Honor.

And we

believe—
QUESTIONS

Well* doesn't that solve your problem?

28
MR* COHENs
QUESTION?
MR» COHENs
QUESTIONS
MR» COHENs

It doesn°t solve the problem* Your Honor.
If the President wants it* he can get it®
That is correct»
Your point is the one that is required»
Our point is that one is required under

the terms of NEPA itself but* more importantly* that the
primary purpose of an environmental impact statement is to
serve the agency which is making a proposal for legislation
or making a proposal maybe for a Federal action* and that the
EIS needs to be prepared not as a post hoc justification for
an allocation on the part of an agency for a particular
program but* rather* in order to analyze the potential
consequences of a proposal»

In fact* the terms of NEPA itself

speak as if a proposal might be implemented»

Section 1022(c)

says that should a proposal be implemented indicating that not
all of the final decisions will have been made regarding
budget allocation and regarding commitments to funding for a
given program»
Under the terms of NEPA we would suggest that if
the Congress had intended to exclude such a major function
of the Governmental process from the terms of NEPA* it would
have done so expressly»

Indeed* the Freedom of Information

Act passed approximately four years prior to NEPA did expressly
excluse various forms of documents from putlic disclosure and
Congress could well have said* in passing NEPA* that it intendec

29

to exclude budget requests from proposals for legislation
or proposals for major Federal action.

It did not do so.

Those Federal courts which have interpreted NEPA and the
budget process have also suggested and held that EISs need
to be prepared for budget requests„

In addition* CEQ has

consistently stated* as we indicated* that budget requests
for appropriations need to be accompanied by environmental
impact statements* even implementing agency regulations have
indicated that NEPA covers budget requests* although none have
ever complied«,
The proposal for legislation in this case* we believe*
clearly covers a budget request and that the term “legislation®
is intended to embrace an appropriation.

In addition* the

term “’major Federal action61 * we believe* embraces the terra
“budget request® or a “request for appropriations'®«,

In many

instances* discreed Federal projects have been accorded
environmental impact statements coverage.

And we believe

that an instance where a discreet- Federal project is subject
to the terms of the Act that certainly a decision by the
agency to commit major resources represents the first and
critical significant decision at the agency level which would
warrant an EIS for that proposal.
The Government has indicated that there is a conflict
between the terms of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921
and the terms of NEPA.

And we would submit that that* in fact*

30

is not the case®

There is no conflict®

There is no conflict

and under the terms of the Act itself confidentiality is not
provided®

An environmental impact statement is an independent™

ly prepared document* one which can serve the

purpose of

agency decision-making and which would not require the dis­
closure of actual budget material.

In addition? any documents

which are made available for the public can be made available
in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act®

And we

would submit that in this circumstance where there are a
limited number of instances involving a limited number of
programs that the budget request process is covered by NEPA®
Thank you* Your Honor®
QUESTION?

Do you have anything further? Mr. Harmon?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M® HARMON
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR® HARMONs

Mr® Chief Justice? in response to

counsel9s point? attempt to describe the consistent interpreta­
tion of the NEPA requirement? I would simply like to point out
that the Congress which passed NEPA has for 10 years received
and acted upon budget proposals from the President without the
preparation of environmental impact statements by the
agencies making their individual proposals®

I make this point

simply to underline that this illustrates a common understanding)
of both Congress and the Executive Branch as to the inapplicabil: ty
of NEPA to fcha budget process®
