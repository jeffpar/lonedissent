MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning, in 1511,$ Califano against Elliott»
Mr» Buscemi* you may proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI, E3Q,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» BUSCEMI:

Mr» Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a challenge to the procedures
employed by the Secretary of Health* Education* and Welfare
in recovering overpayments to the beneficiaries of Social
Security or Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance»
The principal question presented is whether a bene­
ficiary is entitled to an evidentiary hearing before* rather
than after* his monthly benefits are reduced to recover a
p revious overpayment.
The case is here for the second time on a writ of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit.

In 1976* in response to the Secretary's petition for

review* this Court vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals
and remanded for reconsideration in light of the decision in
Mathews v, Eldridge.
The Court of Appeals adhered to its Initial result
and the Secretary again sought certiorari.
There were two .suits consolidated in the Court of

4
Appeals, one from the Western District of Washington, the
Buffington case, and the other from, the District of Hawaii,
Elliott.

Buffington is a nationwide class action on behalf of

recipients of Old Age and Survivors benefits.

Elliott is lim­

ited to persons living in Hawaii, but it includes disability
beneficiaries, as well as old age beneficiaries.
The procedures attacked by Respondents begin with
the Secretary's determination that an overpayment has occurred.
In many cases, this determination is based on an annual earn­
ings report filed by the beneficiaries themselves.
Other times, the initial determination is based on
the Secretary's independent discovery of some administrative
error or a fact or event that affects a recipient's continu­
ing eligibility for benefits.
When the Secretary concludes that an overpayment has
occurred, he notifies the beneficiary of his determination.
Respondents 1 complaints in the district courts
challenged the adequacy of the notice provided, and the dis­
trict courts ordered that the Secretary provide more detailed
information about the reasons for the overpayment and the
availability of administrative review.
The Court of Appeals affirmed and the Secretary did
not seek further review of this aspect of the court's decision.
Instead, he has developed more elaborate notice forms that the
Social Security Administration is now using in notifying

5
beneficiaries that they have received overpayments.
There is* apparently* still some squabbling in the
Court of Appeals over whether the new forms comply with the
Court of Appeals' decision* but that question is not presented
here.
QUESTION:

What question* specifically* is presented?

MR. BUSCEMI:

The question of the adequacy of the

new notice form that the Secretary has developed in response
to the Court of Appeals' decision.
QUESTION:

Whether those forms comply with the Court

of Appeals' decision?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

Is a matter for the Court of Appeals and

now being controverted in the Court of Appeals?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Right.

The Secretary's notice informs the beneficiary of
the date and the amount of the overpayment and the way in which
it occurred.

Local Social Security offices are instructed to

make sure that the explanation is kept in simple and non-technical terms.

The notice also informs the beneficiary of the

Secretary's proposed method of recovery* the amount of the
reduction and the month in which full benefits will be re­
sumed after the overpayment has been recovered.
c

rS

In addition* the beneficiary is told of.his right
to request reconsideration of the overpayment determination or

6
waiver of recovery, or both0

The standards for waiver are set

forth in the notice, and the procedures for requesting reconsid era felon or waiver are described.

The notice identifies the

forms that must be completed in connection with an application
for reconsideration or waiver, and volunteers the assistance of
employees at local Social Security offices in filling out the
forms o
Finally, the beneficiary is advised that, if he does
request reconsideration or waiver within 30 days, his benefits
will not be reduced until after the cSecretary has acted on his
request.

Even if no request is made within 30 days of the

notice, a reconsideration request made within two months, or a
waiver request, whenever made, halts the reductiori of benefits
and results in the resumption of full benefits until after the
Secretary has acted on the request.
The statutory provision that gives rise to all these
procedures is Section 204 of the Social Security Act.

Section

204(a) provides that whenever the Secretary finds that more
than the correct amount of payment has been made, proper adjust­
ment or recovery shall be made under regulations described by
the Secretary.

But Section 204(b) adds a qualification.

It

says that there shall be no recovery -■»
QUESTION:

Where are the provisions set out in your

pa pers ?
MRo BUSGEMI:

They are set out in the Appendix to

7
the cert petition at pages 155-A and I56-A.
The qualification in Section 204(b) provides that
there shall be no recovery in any case where the overpaid per»
son is without fault in receiving the overpayment, and where
the recovery would defeat the purpose of the Social Security
Insurance program, or would be against equity and good con»
science.
QUESTION:
fault"?

What do you take to mean by that "without

Suppose there is a $5.00 increase by a mistake and the

recipient cashes the check»

How does the "without fault" clause

apply to that?
MR0 BUSCEMI:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that

the "without fault" language is described — or is defined,
I should say — in the Secretary's regulations in 20 CPR 404.507,
I believe.

There the Secretary states that the critical con­

sideration is whether the beneficiary should have known that he
was receiving or had received an overpayment.
Mow, in the case of a difference as small as the one
you suggest, it may well be that the average beneficiary should
not have knoivn that he was receiving an overpayment.

And, in

any event, a difference of that size is not likely to be re­
covered by the Secretary because his own claims manual pro­
visions require that there be at least a $10 a month reduction
in benefits.

Otherwise, recovery is simply waived.

QUESTION:

But that's merely an internal instruction.,

8
isn't it

the $10 limit?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?

The $10 limit merely binds the staff of

Social Securityo
MR,

BUSCEM.I:

Yes* that's included in the Claims

Manual* it is not included In the Regulations,

But the Regu­

lations do include the definition* or the Secretary's view* of
the meaning of the words ’’without fault" in the statute.
QUESTION:

What is the practice as to the burden?

In order to recoup* must the Secretary prove fault?

I mean

fault seems to be — If the person is without fault* there can
be no recovery.
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

That's right,

What is the procedure for determining

this issue; or do you know?
MR. BUSCEMI:

The waiver procedure is that the

beneficiary who believes that he was without fault and that
recovery would defeat the purpose of the Social Security
program* files a prepared form with the Secretary* Form
Number SSA-632* and that is divided up into several partss
the first part of which addresses the question of "without
fault."

I think the question says to fcha beneficiary: "State

why you believe you were not overpaid or why you believe you
were not at fault in receiving the overpayment."
QUESTION:

If the Secretary decided on recoupment*

9
there is revlew, I take it?
MR» BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Oh* definitely»

If the Secretary --

Well, what if the reviewing court decided

that the evidence was absolutely equally balanced; who wins?
MR» BUS0 341:
QUESTION:

I don’t know.

I think =-

That's what I asked you a while ago:

Who's got the burden?
MR» BUSCEMI:

-- in a close case like that, the

Secretary would waive recovery.
QUESTION:

So, he then undertakes to prove fault?

MR. BUSCEMI:

Before the administrative review, I

suppose that the Secretary would have to show that the bene-»
ficiary should have known -QUESTION:

In deciding whether to insist on recoup­

ment, the Secretary then assumes
he uses must prove fault.
MR. BUSCEMI:

that - whatever procedures

He undertakes to prove fault.

That’s right»

He undertakes to deter­

mine whether the beneficiary should have known that he was re­
ceiving an overpayment.

And that’s the standard that he use®

in acting on the waiver application, and I assume that the
same standard would apply in the later administrative review
procedure»
QUESTION:
coupment

So that, if the person from whom re­

might be sought, if he's completely silent* the

Secretary still must come forward with proof of fault; is that it?

10

MR„ BUSCEMXl

No* that’s not so,

I think that the

Secretary5^ regulations are a perfectly reasonable implementa/
tion of the statutory scheme. If the person does not request
•Waiver* if the person does not suggest that he was not at
fault* I think the Secretary is justified in proceeding with
recovery.
QUESTION:

If a. check normally was $152* and the

recipient gets a check for $1152 because the computer has
stripped its gears* or something* that would be a clear case*
wouldn’t it* that he was at fault in accepting it?
MR, BUSCEMI:

That's precisely the case* and*as a

matter of fact* there are a substantial number of cases that
are exactly like that.

I think* for example* the case of

Mrs, Biner*, one of the Respondents in the Buffington suit* is
similar to that.

It does not involve a computer error* but it

involves a report to the local Social Security office that
earnings would be discontinued and Social Security benefits
were then begun.

Earnings were continued at the same level

and the Social Security benefit payments were accepted by
Mre, Biner,

She had told the Social Security office that she

would not be earning any money and therefore benefits should
begin.

When she did earn the same amount of money that she

had been earning for the previous two years* she should have
known that the benefits could not be paid at that level.
That's* in fact* what has been found* not only by

11

the Secretary on his initial review of fchs waiver application*
but also by the Administrative Law Judge at the evidentiary
hearing that was provided for her.
QUESTION:

There are at least two different kinds of

errors that can be made; are there not -- at least two, that
is, one where there is a change in status and entitlement and
the other where it is simply a mechanical error; is that
right?
MR. BUSCEMI:

That's right* there are many possi­

bilities .
QUESTION:

Mi% Buseemi, do I correctly understand

that the mere fact that the beneficiary proves that he or she
was without fault is not, enough to establish the right to re­
tain the money?
MR. BUSCEMI:
flciary must also

That's absolutely right.
I"

The bene-

The Secretary must also determine that

recovery would defeat the purpose of the Social Security
Insurance program or would be against equity and good con­
science.

And he has defined those phrases to include such

factors as financial hardship or detrimental reliance.

So

that* even if there is no financial hardship, the regulations
provide, 20 CFR 404.509* that if the beneficiary has relied
to his detriment on an overpayment which he was without fault
in receiving, then there is no recovery, even if it could be
recovered without imposing: any financial hardship.

12

QUESTION:

Does this record show, or do we have to

rely if we need it on Social Security, on HEW reports, as to
how much a year, in each fiscal year, is overpaid for one reason
or another, that is, how much is the area of recoupment?
MR, BUSCBMX:

Well, the record does show the number

of overpayments made in a year — a rather extraordinary number,
approximately

l£ million overpayments a year,

I don't believe

that the record shows the average amount of those overpayments,
although we have obtained the Social Security Administration's
latest figures on that, and they suggest that the average
amount of overpayment Is in the vicinity of $500, so that we
are talking about something like $600 million a year, the total
amount tha t • s ov er pa id»
QUESTION:

You use the 1,25 million.

Does that

mean that many persons or that many checks?
MR. BUSCSMI:

That's a little bit unclear, but I

think it means that many persons.
Now, Respondents contend that Section 204(b) of the
Social Security Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment require that they be afforded an opportunity for an
evidentiary hearing before their benefits are reduced to re­
cover an overpayment.

They devoted little attention to the

statutory argument in the courts below, and neither the Court
of Appeals nor the District Court addressed it.

Rather, the

courts held -chat under this Court’s decision in Goldberg v

13

Kelly the Due Process Clause requires a pre-recoupment hearing.
The Court of Appeals relied heavily on an earlier decision by

,

the Third Circuity Mattern v. Weinberger

that reached the same

result.
The Secretary's Petition for Review of the Third
Circuit's ruling* Number 78699* is now pending.
Five months after the Court of Appeals" decision*
this Court decided: Bid ridge.

Eld ridge held that due process

does not require a hearing before the Secretary may terminate
Social Security disability benefits on the basis of a finding
that disability has ceased..
When the Court remanded the present case for re­
consideration in light of Eld ridge* the Court of Appeals dis­
tinguished Eld ridge and adhered to its earlier conclusion.
QUESTION:

Eldrldge involved* primarily* medical

expert opinion evidence* didn't it?
%

MR. BUS GEM I:

That's right.

In the Court's opinion

in Eldrldge* the Court emphasized that the question of whether
or not a disability continued could be resolved on the basis of
written submissions because the bulk of the evidence would be
medical.

But the Court did note -QUESTION:

Expert medical opinion.

MR. BUSCEMI:

That's right.

-- but the Court did note in Eldrldge that credibil­
ity of the claimant might well be relevant in the ultimate

14

disability assessment.

For example*- where the question of

disability turns on the extent of pain or discomfort in per­
forming certain operations* the claimant's credibility might
well be involved and the Court did recognize that in the
Eldridge opinion.
QUESTION:

Mr. Buscemi, I realize it's difficult*

when you are peppered with questions from nine people*to know
exactly what your oral argument will cover.

Do you plan to

cover in your oral argument the preclusive effect of 205(g)
and the availability of mandamus* or do you intend to leave that
to the briefs?
MR. BUSCEMI:
about that,

Well* I did plan to say something

I can summarize it now* if you would like,

QUESTION:

Use your own judgment.

MR. BUSCEMI:

It is your case.

Well* just to be very brief about it*

the argument that the Secretary has made 'in his brief is that
this Court in the Southby case held that 205(h) of the Social
Security Act precludes other bases of district court juris­
diction and limits district court jurisdiction to that pro­
vided in Section 205(g)-, of the Act. .
On the basis of the statute and this Court’s inter­
pretation in Soufchby* we've argued that there is no possibility
for mandamus jurisdiction* under Section 1361.
That’s the argument.
QUESTION:

That would not prevent us from reaching*

15

in the Government's view, the constitutional questions raised
by a couple of the named parties, but it would prevent the kind
of nationwide class action designated in the Western District
of Washington?
MR. BUSCEMI:

That is our view of the matter.

There

is jurisdiction over the claims of the individual named Res»
pondents because of this Court's interpretation of Section 205
(g) in the Eld ridge case.
There has not been a final decision of the Secretary
at the end of the full administrative review procedure* but
this Court held in Eld ridge that such a final decision was not
necessary inhere there was a constitutional right asserted and
the claim was collateral to the entitlement to benefits.
QUESTION:

Your brief does not deal -- or at least

it dealt very briefly with Section 204* the statutory issue
inherent in this case.

And neither the district court nor

the Court of Appeals treated it.

Do you care to suggest a

hypothesis as to why neither of those courts undertook to
treat the statutory question.
MR. BUSCEMI:
clear.

Yes.

I think the answer is quite

I think the answer is that Respondents made very little

of the statutory issue in the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:
any court

That doesn't' give the court a license --

to ignore the statutory issue* though* does it?
MR. BUSCEMI:

That's true* Mr. Chief Justice* but I

16

do think that the court's view of the case is inevitably
colored by the briefs that are filed by the parties,,

And 1

think that where the claim of the Respondents was almost exclusively addressed to the constitutional pointy it's not
surprising that the court viewed the case in that light„
In any events as we suggest in our reply brief* there
is nothing to the statutory argument in the Secretary's view.
Respondent contends that unless the Secretary undertakes a
very “exacting inquiry*" in his words* concerning fault and the
equitable considerations involved in each case* he violates
the statute6 The idea is that the Secretary cannot recover any
overpayment unless he determines that the criteria of Section
204(b) are not metn

But the point of the Secretary's pro-

cedures is that he determines that the criteria of 204(b) are
not met by asking the individual beneficiary whether he wishes
to request reconsideration or waiver.
If the beneficiary does not wish to request either
of those forms of administrative relief* but instead is willing
to allow the overpayment to be recovered* then the Secretary
goes ahead.
This seems to me a reasonable procedure to effect
the purposes of the statute.
Now* Eld ridge identified three considerations to
guide the Court in determining what process is due in a part leular situation.

The Court of Appeals discussed these* but we

17

think reached the wrong result.
The first of the considerations is the private inter­
est that would be affected by the deprivation.

The Respondents

attempt to analogize the interest in keeping overpayments to
the interest in the continued payment, of welfare benefits that
was at issue in Goldberg v, Kelly.

But there are important

distinctions between the two.
Goldberg is the only case in which this Court has
held that the Due Process Clause requires an evidentiary hear­
ing before an interruption in Government payments.
The situation that prompted this application of the
Due Process Clause was very different from that involved here.
The disputed benefits there were granted on the basis of need*
and by definition they were the only means by which the re­
cipients could pay for food* clothing* shelter and medical
care.
Here* Social Security benefits are not based on
need.

The average Social Security beneficiary may well have

independent assets, he may well be able to earn money by work­
ing and he may well be eligible for welfare payments* if a re­
duction in Social Security payments renders him unable to meet
his current expenses.
QUESTION:

Mr. Buscemi* isn't it true that almost by

hypothesis one who requests a waiver does so on the basis of
needj a claim of need* at least?

18

MRo BUSCEMX:

Well, not necessarily, Mr, Justice

Stevens, as we mentioned in response to your previous question,
the particular recipient may say, "I have relied on the over»
payment.

I was without fault in receiving it, therefore X am

entitled to keep it, whether or not X need it."
QUESTION:

Would the Secretary let that person keep

it if he had a million dollars in the bank?
MR. BUSCEMX:
say that he would.

That's a ~ The regulations, apparently,

The regulations say that if there has been

detrimental reliance -- Now, the Secretary might try to avoid
allowing him to keep it by saying it has not been detrimental,
but X think that he probably would, under the regulations
properly construed.
Xn addition, the deprivation here is not as serious
as the one in Goldberg, because it only involves a reduction
in the amount of benefits, not complete termination.

The only

time in which benefits would be completely terminated, under
the Secretary’s overpayment recovery program, is when the bene­
ficiary is at fault -- X mean when the overpayment was received
as the result of fraud or when the beneficiary had sufficient
income that his entire Social Security check can be withheld
and he will still be able to meet current expenses.
Xn no other situation, under the Secretary's program
will all of the benefits be withheld.
Finally, the third factor that the Eldridge court

19

addressed was fche Government interest in the efficient function­
ing of its program and the administrative burden that addi­
tional procedures would entail*
It is difficult to make precise predictions about the
amount of cost that would be involved in the kind of evidenti­
ary hearing requested by Respondents.

But fche Court in

Bidi .dge said that fche additional costs were likely to be'
substantial any time the additional procedures were required,
and I think that that is equally valid here.
We've cited in our brief several of fche ways in
which fche requirements of the Court of Appeals' decision will
affect the Social Security program, and I don't think it is
necessary fco go into further detail here.
The final thing that I would like to say is that fche
Secretary's procedures have been shown to be reliable on fche
basis of fche experience, not only before fche Court of Appeals
decision but after.

Out of fche l£ million overpayments each

year, there are only approximately 40,000 people who ask for
reconsideration or waiver.

And of those, approximately half

are granted waiver on the basis of fche written submission.
QUESTION: Could it be that fche computers are be­
coming more accurate?
MR9 BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:
for this

Well, we hope so.

I mean that could be one of fche reasons

20

MR® BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

That's right.

So what good is it to us* those figures?

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well* I think the figures are relevant

because they do indicate that the evidentiary hearing sought
by Respondents is not required in order to make sure that pay­
ments are made to those people who deserve them* and that overpayments are not recovered from those people who are supposed
to pay them back®
QUESTION:

Mr® Buscemi* on those figures* a re you

giving us figures under the revised regulations or. those that
were in effect before the litigation began?
MR® BUSCEMI:

Well* the 40*000 figure is a figure

that comes from years more recent than those covered by the
figures before the District Court®

If you look, in the Appendix

of the petition at pages 99~A and 100-A* you will see the
figures that were presented to the.District Court and they are
very incomplete.

They have an accurate figure on the number

of overpayments* but they have a much too small figure on the
number of requests for reconsideration or waiver.
only about 12*000 requests.

They list

It is not clear whether that

12*000 figure includes only requests for reconsideration or
also requests for waiver®
The Secretary now reports that the number of times
he gets a request for reconsideration that's not accompanied
by a request for waiver is very small®

Most beneficiaries do

21

not contest the fact that they have received an overpayment*
or if they do they also ask for waiver.

And that number is

about 40*000.
QUESTION;

A related question* I suppose:

What do

you perceive the issue to be* the constitutionality of the
regulations before they were amended or the constitutionality
of the regulations after the amendment?

Which would mean* I

guess that we don't have the views of the lower courts on the
latter question.

Which are we supposed to decide?

MR, BUSCEMI:

Well* I think that the question is the

constitutionality of the regulations before they were amended.
But the only thing that's been amended is the Claims Manual
which deals with the partial adjustment.
described in our brief.

That's what we've

That has allowed the Secretary to

defer recovery and extend it over a longer period of time.
And it also means that the Secretary no longer proposes a
complete termination of the benefits* he only proposes a 25%
reduction of monthly benefits.
Now that particular provision of the Claims Manual
was not before the courts below* but with respect to the re~
mainder of these provisions —
QUESTION:

That's quite a difference* in terms of the

impact on the beneficiary.

It is quite a difference whether

they lose their entire benefits or just have a reduction.
MR. BUSCEMI:

That's true* but in practical effect*

22

under the partial adjustment system that was in effect before
the courts below, the Secretary# as a general rule did grant
partial adjustments that were requested,,

The difference was

more in the form of the initial notice to the beneficiary.

It

said# "We will stop your monthly benefits unless you request
waiver or reconsiderations or unless you request some other
adjustment*"
QUESTION:

But if the issue is the regulations that

are no longer in effect# why should we really decide that,
if the Government no longer has an interest in defending those
regulations# if it*s got amended regulations in effect now?
MR, BUS-CEMI:

The issue is whether the Respondents

are entitled to an oral hearing before recoupment begins.

That

issue remains under the new regulations,
QUESTION:
issue or on both?

On the waiver issue# or the overpayment
The Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit

dealt with both.
MR, BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Yes# the Court of Appeals —

And according to at least one amicus

brief here# it is the understanding of that amicus that
Respondente aren't defending the Court of Appeals' decision on
the overpayment issue.
MR. BUSCEMI:

That's also a little bit unclear.

I

think Respondents are defending the decision on the overpay­
ment issue# if a particular request for reconsideration raises

23

an issue of credibility»

They are not saying that in the

average case a request for reconsideration requires a private
hearing.

1 may be wrong about that, but that’s the way 1

read it.
QUESTION:

Well, they can tell us, 1 guess.

But in ether words, the Court of Appeals required a
prior hearing for both, at least when credibility of witnesses
was found in it.
MR a BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

And the response of the Secretary was

to say that that's an unrealistic dichotomy, and therefore
for the time being we are providing hearings for everybody.
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Does the Government concede that there

is a constitutional entitlement to a hearing at some time,
a post “reduction hearing?
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Yes, there is no dispute about that.

Would you explain to me, in the Government's

view will there be a greater number of hearings if they come
before the reduction takes effect than if it is postponed?
MRo BUSCEMI:

Well, what's happening is that there

have been personal conferences set up before the recoupment
begins and then the full ALJ hearing has been kept at the time
after the beginning of the hearing.

So, in practical effect,

the Court of Appeals' decision has resulted in the insertion of

24

a new layer of review before the beginning of recoupment.
QUESTION:

Why,, as a matter of discretion, would it

cost the Government anything significant to just move up the
hearing to a pre-reduction hearing instead of a post-reduction
h earing?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, the full ALJ hearing apparently

does entail more expense and more delay than the personal
conference procedure that’s now being used.
QUESTION:

But does it entail more expense if it

comes later instead of earlier?

I mean comes earlier instead

of later.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, it entails more expense in the

sense that it will probably mean that there will be a longer
period of time before recoupment begins, because it is more
difficult -- The informal, personal conference procedure that
the Secretary

has developed to comply with the Court of

Appeals5 decision can be administered much mors simply than
the full ALJ hearing that he has been providing afterwards.
QUESTION:

But didn’t you tell us

-- Maybe I got

this confused — Didn't you tell us that if there is a request
for a waiver that you then do not

that that automatically

suspends things until there is a final decision?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Until there is a decision on the basis

of the written submission.
QUESTION:

I see.

But it doss not suspend it until

25
after the ALJ’s decision?
MR. BUSCEMI:

That’s right.

Once a decision on the

basis of the written submissions is made, then recoupment
begins.

And then, if there is a reversal after the ALJ hearing,

then there is full restitution of any monies that have already
been withheld.
QUESTION:

And you can comply with the Court of

Appeals9 opinion without extending the full ALJ hearing?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, Mr. Justice White.

The Court of

Appeals listed a number of things that have to be provided at
the personal conference and they are provided»

The benefici­

ary is entitled to present evidence through witnesses and
documents.

He is entitled to cross—examine adverse witnesses

and he is entitled to be represented by counsel.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY E. LEVIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LEVIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I think it is Important at the outset feo^say what
this case is really about.
Before you today are elderly, infirm and minor
recipients of Social Security benefits who have been operating

26

under a system which the Secretary has had in operation for
two and a half years,, which has successfully and satisfactorily
provided them with a very flexible administrative procedure
which did not exist prior to this Court of Appeals' judgment*
which allows than -« and meets their capabilities as elderly*
inform and minor recipients — to assert their right to waiver
under the statute»
I'd like to go through for a minute \A!hafc the system
has been for two and one-half years, to show how flexible it
has been and show the various choices®

of overpayment.

How about the feet

Have you* as the amicus American Federation

of labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations understands
it

do you no longer defend the portion of the Court of

Appeals' judgment that relates to the hearings as to the fact
of overpayment?
MR. LEVIN:

That's correct* we do not defend the

need for an opportunity to be heard on a personal confrontation
basis* merely to contest the existence of overpayment.
QUESTION:
MR. LEVIN:
QUESTION:

Abber?
Correct.
So this Involves only a hearing on the

question of whether or rot recoupment should be waived under
the statute 404(b)?

27

MR, LEVIN:

It involves only the issues which are

the highly subjective credibility issues under the Secretary's
own regulations* under his Claims Manual and the other in­
structions of waiver,
QUESTION:

Going exclusively to waiver?

MR, LEVIN:

Only to waiver* yes, sir.

The system for two and one-half years, in answer to
Mr, Justice Stevens' question, has been one which allows three
choices:

a) one of written submissions, which was the only

choice under the earlier system.

And, for the very small

number of recipients who are before you today for whom that is
a meaningful and effective means of asserting their waiver
question, that is still retained.
The other two choices are informal and personal con­
ferences.

And these allow the recipient the vital and crucial

element of a personal confrontation, an opportunity to be heard*
not a full evidentiary hearing.

The requirements are far less

rigid than Goldberg, and the Court of Appeals recognized this
and allowed for this imbalance.
So this system has been in operation for two and a
half years satisfactorily.

The Court of Appeals decision

properly required this kind of system,and we believe it is
consistent with both the statutory 204(b) rights and with the
Constitution.
QUESTION:

In the system that is now In operation

23

under the Court of Appeals decision* as you suggest* how does
the .Secretary proceed?

Assume there is no request for recon­

sideration* only waiver.
MR. LiSVXN:

Is the first issue fault?

Yes* sir»

Contrary to counsel's state­

ment* the burden the Secretary has placed is totally on the
recipient to come forward and show that he is not at fault*
and that either the recovery would be against equity and good
conscience or contrary to the purposes of Title II.
Ho* in answer to Mr. Justice Htevens' question and
some of the other questions regarding the $1 million situation*
if you are not in need* if you are not poor*, you are not en­
titled to waiver.
QUESTION:

In order to deny recoupment* must the

Secretary conclude that the person is without fault?
MR. LEVIN:
QUESTION:

Yes* sir.
And if the person asking for a waiver

presents no evidence whatsoever* he just said* "I was without
fault*" must the Secretary undertake to prove that he was at
fault* or what?
MR. LEVIN:
under 204(b).

That is what Congress says* Your Honor*

The basic fundamental dispute in this case

seems to be a continual ignoring by the Secretary of the
exact wording of 204(b)* and the mandatory language -- what
Congress has said* "We are going to vest the right to a pre­
recoupment waiver decision*" on these very individualized and

29

subjective issues of waiver in the recipients.

Only then if

the Secretary meets the burden under 204(b) can he then take
the money back from them.

And this shifting of the burden

which is so crucial fco recipients who are incapable of
QUESTION:

But if there is fault* he is absolutely

barred from -- he must recoup then* if there is fault,
MR, LEVIN:

That's correct.

That's why the case

involves highly subjective* detailed, factual inquiries into
what fault is in a given situation.
QUESTION:

Could you give an example* put a little

flesh on that?
MR0 LEVIN:

A very good example* Your Honor* would

be one of the named Respondents* Mrs. Yamasaki.

In

Mrs. Yamasaki’s situation* she received a notice saying
that she had been overpaid* due to the Secretary's proces»
sing error* in the amount of approximately $200.

She cashed

the check* not knowing what the check was for and she put in
her request for waiver that she had no idea that she was wrong
to keep the money or accept the money.

Obviously* for her

the only way to effectively present her case* as to whether
or not she was wrong to accept or retain that money* was for
her fco meat person to person with a dec Is ion-maker, and for
him or her to assess Mrs, Yamasaki's credibility.
QUESTION:

What excuse could be offered for taking

$200 more than the entitlement?

30

MRo LEVIN:

There are many situations, Your Honor,

where the Social Security system issues checks, supplemental
checks, retroactive checks, adjustment checks, many situations
where it can be appropriate to keep the money.

In any event,

Congress -QUESTION:

If the payment is $200 more than the

recipient is entitled to, do you suggest there is any excuse
for keeping it, any justification for keeping it?
MR. LEVIN:
has made that choice.

Your Honor, what I am saying is Congress
Congress has said they are vested with

this money until the Secretary comes forward and shows these
grounds under 204(b) to take it away.

Congress has made that

choice, because Congress has reviewed the Social Security
system and knows how difficult and chaotic it is.
QUESTION:

Well, do you suggest that either of the

courts below have made a determination or have exhibited any
great interest in 204(b)?
MR. LEVIN:

Well, they have to the extent that

204(b) is a crucial element in weighing the private interest
in this case, and 204(b) is a crucial element in certain parts
*

of the constitutional analysis.
We did present the argument at every stage of the
appellate process, that the Secretary's recoupment procedures,
as existed then, were absolutely barred by 204(b).
did not rule on it.

The court

31

QUESTION:

If we took the figure -- and for the

moment* for hypothetical purposes* at least* let’s accept it
that there are $600 million a year being paid out that should
not be paid out.
Do you mean to suggest that Congress had any notion
that there should not be recoupment for the vast part of that*
the overwhelming portion of it?
MR0 LEVIN:

Congress said* Your Honor, in 1939s when

it enacted this statute and in 1967 when it affirmed it again,
that person^ who are without fault and against whom recovery
would cause a hardship,, will be able to keep the money.
Now* that $600 million figure is consistent with
other sta tistics which the Secretary has just revealed

un­

veiled *»- lately* and which were never probed at fche district
court level or fche circuit court level* in terms of an evi­
dentiary hearing.
If that is a correct figure* I think, it’s basically
irrelevant to the disposition of this case today.

You. must

look to the congressional intent and the congressional purpose
and language in 204(b).
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting then that tangentially*

at least* Congress contemplated that they would waive $600
million* if that is the figure* or any such figure?

Would

they urge that on any grounds?
MRo LEVIN,; Congress was clearly saying* because they

32

used the words, "shall be no recovery," Your Honor.
QUESTION:

To the tune of $600 million -- you press

it that far?
MR* LEVIN:

That's what Congress said, Your Honor*

Obviously, it would not be to the tune of $600
million*

It never has been, and it's guesstimates and specu­

lation like that on the part of the Secretary -QUESTION:

I said this is purely hypothetical*

don’t know whether that’s the fact.

We

We may or may not be

able to notice it judicially, depending on what the records
of the department show.
MR* LEVIN:
Your Honor*

We don’t know what the exact figure is,

It could be only $100,000.

The point is Congress

said, "We are going to set up a unique statutory scheme, where
this limited group of Eocial Security recipients will be pro­
tected, and that group will be people who are without fault
and against whom recovery will cause a hardship or who detri­
mentally relied on this recovery or retention of the over­
payment *"
QUESTION:

Is there any other governmental provision

that allows people to keep money that doesn't belong to them?

Absolutely, Your Honor.

ment statutes.

MR. LEVIN:

correct or erroneous.

MR, LEVIN:

arise* Your Honor,
The Secretary does take certain steps to move
recipients from various programs* from the disability program
to the retirement program* from the survivors program to the
retirement program.

And when he does that* he sends out

checks -- correctly sends out checks* so you often cannot
presume that the mere sending out of a check which is large
is automatically an error.

Of course* we would

have to assess the credibility of that witness when the wit»
ness said, as in any credibility situation, that he or she
did not know that what he or she was doing was incorrect.
What the Secretary's regulations require* Your Honor*
in response to your question — they require a very detailed
assessment* not only of that fact that you just articulated*
but also the recipient's age, intelligence* physical and
mental condition and a range of other factors to determine
whether the recipient knew* should have known* or could have
known that the retention or acceptance of the overpayment was
wrong.
QUESTION:

It doesn't say without knowledge.

It

says* "without fault*" and that would seem to imply some
causative element.

And if the overpayment of $2*000 was not

directly or indirectly caused by the beneficiary* how could he
have any fault about it?
MR. LEVIN:
Your Honor.

That has generally been our position*

And we believe that the statute has made that

determination* because of using the language* ".fault."

Sut

all I am saying is that is one factor to be considered.

We think

it should be given very little if no weight.
QUESTION:

If the overpayment is not the fault of

the beneficiary* then it's not* whether or not he knew it was

36
an overpayment»
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

What is important to note, in response to your
question, is that Congress knew that there would be many people
overpaid and knew that most of the errors would be clue to the
Secretary's own errors and not recipient-generated errors0
QUESTION:

Now, if the overpayment is the result of

misrepresentations on the part of the beneficiary, that's
clearly his fault.
MR. LEV IN:
QUESTION:

Tha t1 s c or r ec t „
But if an‘overpayment is a computer error

or a miscalculation on the part of the Agency, it is not his
fault at all.
MR. LEVIN:

And most of the recipients before you

today have exactly that situation.

stances — and if so suggest what the circumstances would be —
in which the $200 recipient received $2200 and recoupment should
not be automatic, virtually automatic?

No matter who is -•=

Let's assume, obviously, that this is the error of the Secre­
tary.

QUESTION:

Mr. Levin* could you help me.

I am try­

ing to figure out in my own mind what the constitutional issue
is in this case.
The question presented is whether an oral hearing
must precede the reduction in the recoupment.

An oral hearing-

I had thought that was just a hearing before the ALJ* but it
has been made clear today that there are two different oral
hearings that we are talking about* an informal hearing and
then there is a later hearing before the ALJ.

Under your view*

39
is the Constitution satisfied with the informal hearing?
MR. LEVIN::
QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
Do you understand that the Government is

asking to have that oral hearing dispensed with?
MR. LEVIN::
QUESTION:
MR. LEVIN::

Absolutely.
They don't want even the informal hearing?
That's correct.

They do not want to continue what has been continued
for the last two and a half years and worked satisfactorily»
They want to, perhaps, have the authority to go back to the
old, very limited, very telescoped written submission
procedure^ which is absolutely Inconsistent with the needs
and capabilities of these recipients.
QUESTION:

They want a right to change the regula-

felons back to where they used to be?
MR. LEVIN::
QUESTION:

Perhaps, Your Honor.

We don't know.

Other than that, there is really no

issue before us, isn't that right?
If they said they were satisfied to continue to pro­
vide the oral hearing, there would be no dispute.
MR» LEVIN:

That's right, Your Honor.
They wouldn't have petitioned for car-

QUESTION:
MR, LEVIN:

Well* Your Honor* we believe that the

problem.

it could grant full relief under the mandamus statute or under
205(g)$ and we believe that’s an appropriate disposition of
the case,

MR, LEVIN:

I think it could* Your Honor* normally.

It is not a matter of ruling the statute unconstitutional.
It is the Secretary's procedures pursuant to the statute.
The problem is* Your Honor*, that the reason the class action
and the injunction relief are needed has been the Secretary's
conduct and a series of other litigation that he has not* in
fact* followed rulings of the Courts of Appeals,

For example*

QUESTION:

Two out of eleven.
Those are the only two courts in which

the issue has been presented.
Secondly# the Secretary has only raised this issue
about conflicts in the circuits as a means of claiming they
would never be able to get review by this Court.

confident this Court can control its docket and its calendar
and the matters which come before it and will see that if a

to occur for this group of recipients.
It essentially makes Social Security recipients,
Your Honor^ second-class citizens.

It essentially says that,

they cannot get full relief in federal court on constitutional
challenges to illegal procedures of the Secretary.
QUESTION:

I am sorry.

QUESTION:

Incidentally, is Respondent Elliott out

of the case?
MR. LEVIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Are you going to substitute somebody for

him?
MR. LEVIN:

We will take appropriate action and do

that, Your Honor, yea.
QUESTION:
MRo LEVIN:

You have not c rose-appeal ad ?
No, sir.

There are several more points which I would like to
make in my remaining time.
As I was indicating earlier, the Secretary has made
certain changes in his procedur-es, his Claims Manual procedures
which are non-binding, they are not part of the administrative
:■

44
regulations.

And those procedures

he claims are material to

the distribution of the constitutional issue and balancing of
the private interests in this case.

We believe that those

changes are absolutely regressive and do not enhance the
situation whatsoever# because they actually affirmatively
discourage persons and recipients from asserting their right
to waiver.
I can explain that in a moment# but what is impor­
tant to us# Your Honor# is that if this Court in any way
believes these changes are material to the disposition of
this case# we believe the case ought to be remanded back to
the district courts which issued the injunctions In this case#
for them to probe the effect# if any# of those procedural
changes.

We do not think that we should be discussing de novo

these procedures in December of 1978# after six and a half
years 1 litigation# based on a particular system of recoupment.
QUESTION:

Do you think# Mr. Levin# that the changes

change the issues in this case?
MR. LEVIN:

They certainly do not provide the pre°

recoupment opportunity to be heard — not the evidentiary
hearing# but the opportunity to be heard# as required by the
Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:
MR. LEVIN:
QUESTION:

And that is the issue?
That is the Issue.
And that remains the same issue# even

45
after the changes?
MRc LEVIN:
is still there.

That is correct., Your Honor,

That issue

What these procedure changes do, Your Honor,

unfortunately, is they discourage waiver assertions by clients,
because they actually insure that clients who seek waiver will
not get the maximum 25% partial adjustment protection.
covery against them is open-ended.

Re-

So, obviously, if I know

I can get a 25$ maximum recovery I'll do that and I'll forego
my statutory and perhaps constitutional right to have the case
decided.

And that is a direct and affirmative discouragement

to the statutory right to waiver.

And it is because of that

this certainly is a justiciable controversy.

We think the

effect of that should be litigated, if the Court thinks that's
material, in the lower courts where this properly belongs.
To that end, we made a motion to dismiss a remand in this case
In January, but it was denied.

We renew that request now, if

the Court deems these procedures material.
QUESTION:

If you say that everybody but the named

Plaintiffs have been getting recoupment hearings, in accordance
with the decision of the Court of Appeals for two and a half
years, what 's left cf the class?
MR. LEVIN:

Well, people who come forward on an on­

going basis, Your Honor.

If this Court were not to rule in our

favor
QUESTION:

It's a constantly revolving class?

MR. LEVIN:

Yes, sir,, it is, because the Secretary

issues these recoupment notices daily.

He issues 1.25 mil­

lion of them a year, most of which are his errors.

In that

vein, therefore, there are people who are regularly trying to
assert their right to waiver.
I would like to make a point here, though, Mr. Justice
White.

The point is that the notice aspect of this case, which

counsel indicated was not before this Court, is an important
thing to keep in mind, because both the lower courts and the
Ninth Circuit found that people were not properly informed of
their right to waiver.

Because of that, many of them do not

exercise certain statutory and constitutional rights they
would have certainly otherwise done.
The Secretary has not appealed that,

end that's

res judicata, and that is an essential difference between this
case and certain other cases where you would require exhaustion
of administrative remedies and be concerned about the class
definition.

Because in this case you have a fundamentally,

constitutionally defective notice,, where persons could not
have exhausted, could not have asserted their rights because
they didn't know what their rights were.
And I think,the maneuver by the Secretary not to
appeal that decision -- I do not want that to relieve this
Court of ““
QUESTION:

But if we agreed with you and said that

47
on behalf of the named Plaintiffs

the named Plaintiffs were

entitled to a declaratory judgment, that whatever is attacked
here was unconstitutional, do you need anything else than that?
MR* LEVIN:

Your Honor, again, I go back to my

answer to a question by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

The problem with

that, to the extent that you authorize or approve of or acqui­
esce in the Secretary's position that Social Security recipients
are not entitled to class actions in Federal court for pro­
cedural, constitutional attacks or statutory attacks, like
Califano v. -QUESTION:

But that's sort of a generality that may

not be involved in this case.

If the very provision you are

attacking here is declared to be unconstitutional, what more
do you need or want?
MR. LEVIN:

I assume the Secretary would abide by

a decision of this Court, and if he did that we would not need
anything further, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Of the million or more who receive checks

every year -- several millions, perhaps
check back?

how many send the

Does this record show how many people send the

check back and say, "Dear Mr. Secretary, you've made a mistake,
I'm not entitled to all this money"?
MR. LEVIN:

I have no idea, Your Honor.
Do you have a copy of the Petitioners'

MR. LEVIN:
QUESTION:

Yes* we did, Your Honor.
It was referred fco this morning in oral

argument, and until that reference was made I didn't know
there was one.

It was filed only last Friday.

MR, LEVIN:

Yes, Your Honor, we got it the last

And we reviewed it and we think it is the first

occasion in which the Secretary

Goes to the statutory.
Absolutely, Your Honor.

For six years

-- and we raised it in the lower courts and the complaints and
we raised it in the Appellate Court, we briefed it, and the
Secretary has ignored it and treated it as though it did not
exist.
QUESTION:
MR. LEVIN:

Also the Court of Appeals?
The Court of Appeals recognized it,

Your Honor, for the importance of balancing the private
interest in this case, recognizing that it was a congressional
mandate that there shall be no recoupments, only in these
certain situations.
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals ignored the claim

that the statute itself requires a prior hearing, and instead
said that the Constitution requires one.
MR. LEVIN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

We would

take the position that we believe an affirmance is absolutely
appropriate in this case, but that if the Court believed it

49
necessary, we could go back to the Court of Appeals and liti­
gate the statutory issue, because we believe it is an essential
issue in this case.

And this Court has indicated on many oc­

casions it is the first duty of any reviewing court to try to
dispose of a constitutional issue without reaching the con™
stltutional issue and first disposing of it on statutory
grounds, which can be done in this case.
QUESTION:

If we affinned on the statute, would that

change your relief?
MR, LEVIN:
QUESTION:

I don’t think so, Your Honor.
So, I suppose, you could say you are

entitled to urge the statutory ground now hare,
MR, LEVIN:

That's what we are doing, Your Honor,

and we've briefed it thoroughly.

Although if the Court be­

lieves that it's essential to have the thoughts and disposi­
tion of the lower court, we would be willing to go back and
litigate that issue there at that time.

Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
