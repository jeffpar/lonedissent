ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. HAMMER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, HAMMER:

Mr.. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The question presented by this case is whether a
statute which provides for the summary suspension of the
occupational license of a harness racing participant, prior to
any hearing on disciplinary charges, denies such licensee
due process or equal protection of the laws.
A statutory District Court for the Southern District
of New York held that, indeed, it did.
We respectfully disagree.

We have appealed, and

we ask this Court to reverse.
On June 22, 1976» a horse named "BE ALERT" which was
trained by the Plaintiff ran second in a race at Mcnticello
Raceway.

Prior to the race, a blood test x\?as conducted to

determine whether any drugs were in the horse's system.
test XAias passed.

That

However, subsequent to the race, a urine

test was conducted and traces of a drug called "Lasix" were
found in the horse's urine.
At page 6A of the Jurisdictional Statement, Note 9

4
in the opinion of the three-judge court, the court pointed out
that Lasix is a diuretic and may, in fact, enhance the per­
formance of the animal.

Under the Rules of the Racing and

Wagering Board, no such drug may be given to a horse within
48 hours of a race.
As I indicated, this race was conducted on June 22nd.
Two days later, the post-race test results came back and
Mr. Barchi, the Plaintiff, was called before the Stewards.
He was given word of this test results and was asked for an
explanation.

Subsequently, both at his initiative and at the

Initiative of the Racing Wagering Board, two separate poly­
graph tests were taken.

Apparently, the polygraph indicated

that Mr. Barchi was being truthful in his statements, and
despite the efforts of the Board to find out exactly what
happened to the horse an inconclusive investigation ensued.
On the 8th of July, the trainer's license was sus­
pended on the basis of what is called the "Trainer's
Responsibility Rule," which, as in the case of a ship's
captain who is responsible for everything that goes on on
board, the trainer, likewise, is responsible for the health
and condition of his horse.
Now, he had the opportunity, as we indicated, for
an informal conference at the time he X'jas originally confronted
with the results of the test.
within the

We suggest that this would come

-ule of Goss v. Lopez.

5
Under the statute, Section 8022 of our unconsolidated
laws, he could have had a full quasi-judicial hearing within
a few days.

However, he did not avail himself of this oppor­

tunity to be heard and, as a result, this case was brought.
Under Section 8022, a licensee is the prime mover of any
hearing conducted as a result of disciplinary action taken
against him,,

Only he may demand a hearing and he must demand

it within 10 days.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hammer, may I just ask one question,,

When they find the evidence of drug in the horse and it is
presumed the drug affected the performance of the animal in
the race, as I understand your rule, does that mean that
something is done with the race itself where the results
change?

Is there anything to undo the harmful consequence

to the public of the race itself?
MR. HAMMER:
at that time.

Well, Your Honor, nothing can be done

The pari-mutuel payoff is immediate, and the

results of the race are not affected.
QUESTION:

Is there any discipline against anyone

other than the trainer, as a result of that finding and that
presumption?
MR. HAMMER:

The presumption is a rebuttable pre­

sumption, which relates only to the trainer.
Mr. Justice Stevens,

However,

that a third party, a track tout, or someone elsc's groom

a presumption that the performance of the animal was effected
by it* which* of course* would affect the owner's record* and
all the rest* nothing happens to anyone* except to the trainer*
as a result of that presumption»
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

That is correct* Your Honor.
Sometimes you see the inquiry sign go up

on the tote board* and it stays on for about 20 minutes or
a half an hour and then it is replaced by an official sign
and they put up the odds.
MR. HAMER:

Do they have that at Monticello?

Yes* that would be a standard part of

the tote board.
I am advised by my colleague* Mr. Daly, that where*
in fact* it is determined that the race was affected by
drugging* then it is in within the power of the Racing and
Wagering Board to take back the purse.

However, the pari­

mutuel results aren't affected because of the immediate payoff
on pari-mutuel bets.
QUESTION:

I think you may have been over-broad —

at least I should think you were -- in responding to
Mr. Justice Stevens.

If It was demonstrated affirmatively

that the owner*and not the trainer*, had drugged the horse*
and that the owner had done this without the trainer's

7
knowledge, then, surely the trainer would not be finished,
would he?
MR. HAMMER:

Yes, in fact, I made that point to

MR. HAMMER:

No, Your Honor, it was not.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

was suspended, to resume at 1:00 o'clock, p.m., the

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may resume, Mr. Hammer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. HAMMER, ESQ., (RESUMED)
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HAMMER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

If the Court please, just prior to the luncheon
recess, Mr. Justice Stevens asked about what happens when a
horse is found to have been drugged.
I took the opportunity to look up the rule of the
Racing and Wagering Boards

it is Rule 4120.10, and it does

provide for a mandatory forfeiture of the purse,, where a horse
has, in fact, been drugged and the drugging could have affected
the outcome of the race.
QUESTION:

Was the purse forfeited here?

MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

I believe it was, Your Honor.
We can assume that it was.

MR. HAMMER:

This was not in the case, but I would

assume that it was forfeited.
Now, the statute in question is Section 3022 of the
New York Unconsolidated Law, and It is reproduced at page 3 of
the Appellant’s brief.

It provides that where the Stewards

impose any sanction, such as a fine or suspension, the
licensee may demand a hearing within 10 days.

Thereafter,

the Racing and Wagering Board must schedule a prompt hearing

9
and must render a final decision within 30 days*

This

administrative determination is reviewable in a special
proceeding under Article 73 of the New York Civil Practice
Log Rules, which would be in the nature of certiorari»
The statute provides that, pending the final determin­
ation, the suspension or revocation remains in effect»

How­

ever, there is no specific prohibition upon the Racing and
Wagering Board, sui sponte, in its own discretion, granting
a stay of its own punishment»
The statutory history of Lection 8022 and the rest
of the racing laws is a rather interesting one, and we have
set it out at pages -QUESTION:

Just so I have it in mind, what was imposed

here?
MR» HAMMER:
QUESTION:
MR» HAMMER:
QUESTION:
MR, HAMMER:
QUESTION:

A 15-day suspension, Your Honor»
That was the total punishment? That is all, sir„
It ’was not a permanent *Absolutely not»
So by the time there could be any review,

the suspension — the entire punishment would have been over?
MR«HAMMER:

Not necessarily, Your Honor»

QUESTION.: _Well, 15 days is 15 days.

Well, there

•were 30 days for a review, I take it.
MR» HAMMER:

The statute grants the Board up to 30

10

days bo render its decision„

VJhat happens in practice, in

cases of this kind, is that the process is accelerated to
a much greater degree.

In this instance, and there is a

companion case, Daigneault, which we refer to.

He was

Plaintiff here never even requested a hearing.
QUESTION:

Let me go back to your administrative

If he had requested a hearing, he could have asked

for and could have received a stay of the suspension until
the decision was made, is that right?

Is that what you were

telling us?
MR. HAMMER:

It is our position, Your Honor, that

although the statute, itself, is somewhat unclear -QUESTION:

It says the suspension shall stay in

MR. HAMMER:

That's what it says.

However, in

practice and -- there "was an offer of proof on the record,
Your Honor, which the District Court did not see fit to take
us up on.

We \vere prepared to show, and it is contained in

part in the affidavit of John Daly, who at that time was
Chief Counsel for the Racing and Wagering Board, that in
practice, the Board does, in a proper case, stay its own
action.
QUESTION:

I suppose the Board could say -- tell

somebody, "Vie are considering a suspension," and just not

11

Impose it until there is a hearing* or until there is an
investigation.
MR. HAMMER:

Well* the harness — In harness

At that point* the licensee

QUESTION:

The language is rather explicit* isn’t

it* that pending such hearing the action suspending a
license shall remain in full force and effect.

And you say

that doesn't mean what it says,
MR.HAMMER:

That's correct* Your Honor,

Anomalous as it sounds —
QUESTION:

Where does that appear* other than you

telling us so?
MR. HAMMER:

It appears in the record in the

affidavit of John Daly* which appears -QUESTION:
MR. HAMMER:

Is that in the offer of proof?
Yes* and also on the record *

the

transcript of the hearing.
QUESTION:

Is it just that they regularly disobey

the statute* is that it?
MR. HAMMER:

Put it this way:

construed* administratively* to

That the statute is

in such a way as to achieve

substantial justice in meritorious cases,
QUESTION:

And you are representing the State of New

12

York, I take it?
MR. HAMMER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

To further answer Your Honor's question, Mr. Justice
White, at page 20 of our brief, we cited Mr. Daly's affidavit,
page

of the Appendix.

Reference was also made at page

28A of the Jurisdictional Statement, as well.

And we made

the offer of proof on pages 27 through 30 of the transcript
of the argument before the three-judge court.
QUESTION:

What is the significance of a regulation

and a statute, or any other provision, which says one thing
and we have assurance that the present people in office won't
enforce it?

What effect does that have on this Court?

MR. HAMMER:

If it were merely an assurance that

the present people in office do not —
QUESTION:

Is there anything in there that says

what the future people will do?

There is no way you can

predict what a future official will do.
MR. HAMMER:

Except, Your Honor, by the established

administrative practice of the agency, which I think, had
we been given the opportunity, we could have proven, as a
matter of fact.
QUESTION:
MR. HAMMER:

Proven what?
That, as a matter of well-established

administrative interpretation, stays were, indeed, granted.
QUESTION:

Always?

13

MR. HAMMER:

As a matter in the discretion of the

Board.
QUESTION:
MR, HAMMER:

Oh* in the discretion?
Your Honor* when I apply to this Court

for stays of lower court judgments and Your Honor has, as
Circuit Justice,has had to exercise his discretion.

Your

Honor has the power.
QUESTION:
MR. HAMMER:

I have never suspended a jockey.
What I am suggesting, Your Honor, is

that, in your capacity as Circuit Justice, you have the
discretionary authority to grant me a stay —
QUESTION:

I have the discretionary authority to

ignore a statute?
MR. HAMER:

Not ignore it, Your Honor, interpret

it.
QUESTION:

To interpret it as saying no when it

says yes?
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:
foot.

Well, statutes —
That's larger than the chancellor of the

I have never seen a chancellor of the foot that large

before.
MR. HAMMER:

Well, I can only suggest, Your Honor,

that the record, as established below, indicates that we
offered to prove this as a matter of fact.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hammer, it does seem to me that we

14

do have a problem of New York Law here* that reading this
language that some of my brethren have quizzed you about*
"pending such hearing and final determination thereon* the
action of the Commission refusing to grant and revoking or
suspending a license or an imposing of monetary fine*

shall

remain in full force and effect*" seems kind of incongruous
with the Commission's initial determination.
Is it possible that that pending sentence is directed
at the courts of New York* rather than to the Commission?
MR. HAMMER:

It is conceivably a possible inter­

pretation of the statute.

There simply has been relatively

little case law on this point.
QUESTION:

General Hammer* could I ask another

question about this language.

You point out that the

affidavit of John Laly indicates there is a practice.

Now*

the statute refers to an action of the Commission remaining
in effect* but Daly's affidavit refers to a suspension of any
penalty imposed by track judges* pending administrative
review.

What are track judges?
MR. HAMMER:

Track judges are the state Stewards

who make the initial determination.

What the statute is

referring to.
QUESTION:
MR. HAMMER:

Are they the Commission?
No* the statute refers to the determina­

tion of the Commission after a hearing.

15
QUESTION:

What I am suggesting is that there is

no inconsistency between the statute and the affidavit,
because the affidavit talks about staying a penalty imposed
by track judges, whereas the statute refers to an order of
the Commission remaining in effect*
MR» HAMMER:
QUESTION:

I think that is correct, Your Honor,
So then, we just accept the statute and

there is no conflict in the record at all?
MR, HAMMER:

I think that, indeed, resolves the

problem.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hammer, may I get a question in, too.

This particular sentence in the statute has not been
construed by your state courts, has it?
MR. HAMMER:

We have the Tapp as case, which was

referred to in the opinion of the three-judge district court.
The Tapp.as case involved merely a fine.

It did not involve

a suspension.
QUESTION:

Well, in your jurisdictional statement,

you made an extension argument based on the Pullman case.
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:
on the merits here.
MR. HAMMER:

Right.
I see no similar argument in your brief
Have you abandoned this approach now?
We have not entirely abandoned it.

It was felt, after some review and discussion within the
office, that perhaps the abstention argument was not quite

16

as strong as we initially thought it was.

I think abstention

— my personal view is that, perhaps, abstention might, indeed,
be appropriate.
I don't think Tappas* which was the New York Court
of Appeals opinion, really addressed itself to the issue at
hand.
QUESTION:
MR.HAMMER:

Tappas didn't deal with 8022, did it?
Tappas was a harness licensee, and I

think Tappas did deal with 8022.
QUESTION:

Co you think the Pullman issue is before

us now?
MR. HAMMER:

I think the issue remains before Your

Honors.
QUESTION:
MR. HAMMER:

Why?

You don't argue it.

Well* it was raised in the jurisdictional

statement.

I don’t think it is the most important issue in

the case,

I think arguably it is a position that Your Honor

might find appropriate,
QUESTION:
MR. HAMMER:

Even though you don’t press it here?
I don't press it vigorously, but I

do believe it is in the case.
QUESTION:

What happens if the judgment of this

Court noted it just on the Pullman point?
do you?

You don't know*

i am talking about alleging something in your

jurisdictional statement and then not following it.

17

MR, HAMMER:

I think* frankly* Your Honor* insofar

as following it up* the cases on point* Pullman* Carey v* Sugar*
lay out a very simple and rather straightforward rule of law*
I don’t think I could have added anything*
What I think is terribly important here and really
is the cornerstone of our argument* is the fact that the
stringent racing laws that prevail in New York were adopted
after a legislative finding based upon its investigation and
upon the Governor's Moreland Act investigation* which demon­
strated a need for the strictest kind of policing and super­
vision*

It is interesting to note that until 19^0 there was

no pari-mutuel betting on harness racing*

We are not dealing with a situation where -- We don't take

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that this is analogous

to the summary proceedings that are sometimes employed to take
a dangerous drug off the market* or a medicine* or a food stuff*
when it is doscovered that it is dangerous* that there is a
summary suspension and then a hearing?

QUESTION:
the suspension?

Under what section did the steward issue

What authorized him to issue the suspension?

MR. HAMMER:

The steward suspended the license under

the racing regulations* as found in Title 9 of the New York
Codes* Rules and Regulations* which Is the State analog for
the CFR, and it is reprinted —
QUESTION:

Who issued the regulations?

MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

The Racing and Wagering Board.
So* is that the Commission?

MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

The steward is the agent of the Board.
Is that the Commission?

Is that --

In Section 8022* it refers to a Racing Commission.

That's

the Board?
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

Tha t * s c orrec t.
And they have issued regulations?

MR. HAMMER:

The Harness Racing Commission was

subsumed under the State Racing and Wagering Board.
QUESTION:

And the stewards are their agents*

authorized to make these suspensions?
MR. HAMMER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So, the suspension, in effect, was issued

by the Commission here?
MR. HAMMER:

It was issued by an authorized agent

of the Commission, subject to review at the request of the
licensee, either full Commission or full Board.

20

QUESTION:
to Justice White,

I am nofc sure you completed your answer

Precisely what section of the regulations

authorize the suspension?
MR, HAMMER:

I think you started to tell us,

The suspension was authorized — It

was for violation of Sections 4ll6.ll* 4120.U5 and 4120,6 of
the Rules of Harness Racing.

They are reprinted at page 5A

of our Jurisdictional Statement.
QUESTION:

But none of those sections refer to

suspension of the trainer.
MR. HAMMER:

There is an earlier section of the

Racing Rules* which authorized suspension for violation of
these other rules.

I think that this is not contested.

QUESTION:

But is there a standard set forth in that

earlier regulation of when there shall be a suspension?
automatic?

Is it

Is it after a finding that he had something to do

with it* or what, is the standard?
MR. HAMMER:

This is within the discretion of the

stewards.
QUESTION:
MR, HAMMER:

So do you have the section?
It is Section 8009 of the Unconsolidated

Laws,
QUESTION:

I take it* that refers to the Board or the

Commission?
MR. HAMMER:

It refers to the judges who have been

appointed by the Racing and Wagering Board.

21

QUESTION:

I gather it Is not printed anywhere here?

MR, HAMMER:
QUESTION:

No, sir,
That's all right.

We can get it.

Just to make one point clear, you do not contend
that there is any flat rule that requires suspension of the
trainer whenever a drug is found in a horse that he trained?
MR. HAMMER:

We contend that this is a rule that

is enforced as a matter of discretion, that while the trainer's
responsibility rules are rules of law, in practice-- and this
was our contention before the three-judge court, which appears
in the transcript which is filed with Your Honors, that the
stewards, nevertheless, have discretion in enforcing it,
QUESTION:

Does that mean, just to put it bluntly,

that if the track judges, or the Commissioners had decided to
believe the lie detector results,and thought this man was
totally innocent, they could have not suspended him without
violating any statute.
Then, does the record tell us why they did suspend
him?
MR, HAMMER:

The record does not so show.

It is

something that would have, had a hearing been heldfi and if the
Plaintiff had, indeed, requested a hearing, it could have
been developed at that hearing.
I think what's important here is to remember that
even though there is some possible element of irreparable injury

22

and we don’t deny it

how much injury through loss of

earnings, we can, of course, not tell.
it is speculative.

Not with any accuracy,

But this Court, in its decisions in the

Bob Jones case and the Enochs case which we cite, has laid down
a rule that even where irreparable injury, even total destruc­
tion of the enterprise may result. You can establish a law here
in that case, for mere administrative convenience, which would
preclude prehearing stays or preheating injunctions against a
determination.
I just want to touch briefly on the equal protection
question.

It is our position that it should not even have been

decided by the district court, since they had already held the
statute unconstitutional on other grounds.
constitutional overkill, as it were.

This was a matter of

It was unnecessary under

the rule of Peters v. Hobby.
As we have indicated in our brief, there is a
rational basis for the statute in terms of its statutory
history.

On the other hand, in practice, both harness and

thoroughbred trainers are treated alike.

In a section of the

thoroughbred rules, the thoroughbred licensees are treated
in the same way

this is Section 4013.13 — under the rules,

all penalties imposed by the stewards remain in effect, pending
judicial or administrative review.
If the Court please, I'll simply reserve the last
few minutes for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH A. FARAIDO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. FARAIDO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent John Barchi, the Appellee in this case,
and seek the affirmance of the decision of the three-judge con­
stitutional court below, which struck down New York’s Section
8022 of the Unconsolidated Laws, as unconstitutional, both as
a deprivation of due process of law and equal protection of
the law.
Mr. Barchi had a very substantial interest in
continuing in his livelihood, something which he had built up
over a long period of time.
The race that we are talking about occurred on June
22, 1976, and on June 24th, Mr. Barchi was called to the track
steward’s office, and the track steward, as my brother has
stated, is an arm or extension'or agent of the Commission,
itself.

The actions of that judge and the actions of the

Commission are, for all intents and purposes, the same.
On the 24th, he was called into the office and
informed by the judge that he had had a positive "Lasix."
In other words,

The next contact that we had in this case was

polygraph exam* in order to profess his innocence* which he had
professed from the very beginning.

He passed the polygraph

exam that was given privately, and on the following day, at the
request of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board* he
took and passed a second polygraph exam.
QUESTION:

You say, he took a polygraph exam.

What

questions relevant to this inquiry was he asked and did he
answer?
MR. FARALDO: X believe that they are part of the
Appendix in this case.
QUESTION:

Could you summarize?

MR. FARALDO:
given

Lasix

anyone to give

He was asked whether or not he had

to this horse, whether or not he had directed
Lasix ' to this horse, whether or not he knew

if anyone, indeed, had given Lasix to this horse, or if he
knew any of the circumstances how this prohobited substance
got into this particular horse.
QUESTION:

If the Commission believed him as to all

those answers, would that make Rule 4120.6;,the trainers
responsibility rule, inapplicable to him?
MR. FARAIDO:

The way it has been interpreted by

the New York State VR&eing - and Wagering Board In Some of the

25

jurisdictions around the nation* the answer to that is no.
It has been my experience that this has been interpreted as
an absolute rule of liability* in some of the jurisdictions*
not all.
QUESTION:

Didn't the District Court* which generally

ruled in your favor* say that was a proper rule?
MR. FARAIDO:

They said it was a rebuttable pre­

sumption* or at least some of them were rebuttable.

However*

there is a presumption in one of the rules under which my
client was suspended, which says "It shall be presumed the
trainer administered the drug to the horse* with the intent to
effect the, speed or outcome of a horse race."

In addition*

it says* "And upon the mere finding of the presence of a drug
in the horse's system* there is a presumption that it was given
to the horse within 48 hours of his race."
How anyone could rebut those presumptions is beyond
me* since we have never seen the sample* we were never con­
fronted with the sample that was taken from the horse -QUESTION:

Did you ask for it in an administrative

hearing?
MR. FARALDO:
QUESTION:

Did you ask for it?

MR. FARAIDO:
QUESTION:

It is never given* Your Honor.

No* we did not ask for it.

Then you can’t rightly complain about

not getting it* can you?

26

MRa FARAIDO:

We were not aware of the fact that

they were going to suspend my client without any type of a
hearing whatsoever, at that point in time.

They led us to

believe that they were continuing some sort of an investigation,
and then in the latter part of the week we were hit with the
notice of suspension.

We never saw or were confronted with

how the sample was taken, what the analysis showed -QUESTION:

If you had gone into an administrative

hearing, you would have been able to challenge that right away,
wouldn’t you?
MR. FARAIDO:

That is correct, Your Honor, but at

that point in time, I think the administrative remedy is
meaningless, if there is no stay.

And i^hile there has been

an allusion made to this Court that they do possess the dis­
cretion to grant a stay -QUESTION:

You say that very rapidly, but how are

we to know now that if you had asked for the administrative
hearing that the statute provides for, that you might not have
had your man cleared, and there never would have been any
lawsuit?
MR. FARAIDO: Your Honor, since I stopped grooming
horses and became a lawyer, I have never seen one instance
where a stay was granted by this Board.

After this particular

case was argued before the HonorabDe Mr. Justice Catell in
the District Court, seeking the convocation of a three-judge

27

court, I had a client suspended for 15 days.
stay in that case.

I requested a

That is the Dalgneaulfc case which my

brother makes reference to.

The stay was refused.

They did

say to me on that occasion that "We will give you a prompt
hearing,"but if there is no stay -- and Daigneault had a 15-day
suspension, identical to Barchi, then the question would be moot.
They are not providing my client with an opportunity for
a meaningful opportunity to be heard in a meaningful time.
That’s all I asked for.
we did not ask.

That was not given to Barchi.

I agree

In Daigneault when we did ask, two days after

argument on Barchi, we were flatly refused again.
I have represented a number of harness horse
trainers.

In the record before this Court in May of 1976, five

trainers were suspended up at Monticello on the same facts.
Proof of the presence of a drug in the system is a suspension to
the trainer.

Now, they hold out a reed of justice by saying to

us "Come file your notice of appeal within 10 days, and we
shall promptly schedule you a hearing."

That has never happened.

None of the five trainers at Monticello Raceway suspended in
May of 1976 — not a single solitary one of them — availed
themselves of this so-called meaningful opportunity to be heard.
This is not a meaningful opportunity.
QUESTION:

I am not sure what this has to do with

this case. but let me ask you another question.
Neither of you, as far as I observe, has cited the

28

case of Securities and Exchange Commission v, Sloan, which was
decided in this Court in May of this year.

There, the Federal

statute in the Securities Act authorized 10 days suspension,
summary proceeding for violation of certain trade provisions.
How would you distinguish what New York does here in the racing
area from the Securities suspension procedure of 10 days?
MR. FARAIDO:

Not having the case before me, Your

Honor, it makes it pretty difficult.

However, there is one

thing in Barchi^ which is very significant and that is the
irremedial loss to Mr. Barchi, the fact -- different from the
cases in this Court
QUESTION;

Well, if a trader is suspended from

trading for 10 days, that's quite a loss to him, isn't it, in the
stock market?
MR. FARAIDO:

Yes, I would agree, but this bears

upon an individual's right to earn a livelihood,

In the horse­

racing business, as soon as you are suspended as the trainer,
the owner automatically loses the purse.

If the owner wishes to

continue with you, he is barred also from racing.

Barchi is

barred from racing all throughout the United States of America.
He cannot earn his livelihood anywhere.

All of the owners that

he has accumulated over a course of years, as a result of his
own expertise in this area, are gone.
QUESTION:
for a hearing?

He is stigmatized --

Isn't a part of that his rei*usal to ask

29

MR. FARAIDO:

I would agree with that if the hearing

were meaningfulp hut if he did ask for the hearing without a
provision for a stay given to harness racing licensees* while
there is one given to thoroughbred racing licensees* then the
hearing is meaningless at that point in time.
QUESTION:

The suspension here was for 15 days.

MR. FARAIDO:

That is correct* but during that

period of time* Your Honor —
QUESTION:

I understand* but after the 15 days

expired* he was free to practice his trade again.
MR. FARAIDO:

Yes* he is* but during the 15 days he

loses all the owners whose horses have to race during that
15-day period* because so long as they employ him as trainer*
their horses will not race.

So he cannot earn a portion of the

purse which the trainer gets.

And once those horses are given

to another trainer ■— It would be like an attorney suspended
from the practice of law.

He is not going to hold onto his

clients during the interim.

If it is in the middle of a trial*

he has to get himself another attorney.
QUESTION:

But if you want a stay* you are going to

have to have some sort of a hearing on the stay* aren't you?
MR. FARAIDO:
QUESTION:

A hearing on the issue of the stay?

Yes.

You say that the invalidity of this

rule and statute is that it doesn't allow the Commission to
grant a stay of a suspension.

Are you saying that the stay

i

30

should be automatic?
MR, FARAIDO:

I am saying that parallel to Section

401 of the State Administrative Procedure Act* that there
certainly are instances where stays do not have to be given,
in emergency situations.,
QUESTION:

If there are instances where stays don't

have to be given* then there must be sane sort of a hearing
that the Commission would have to hold to decide whether your
client is one of those instances or not.

Inevitably, you are

going to have a certain lapse of days in there, are you not?
MR. FARAIDO: I would believe so, yes,
QUESTION:

But you just say 15 is too many?

MR. FARAIDO:

Well* 15 causes an irremedial loss

to the trainer.
QUESTION:

How about 10 days?

MR, FARAIDO:

Ten days would probably not work as

great a detriment, but it would come very close.
horses race once a week.
txtfo weeks of racing.
QUESTION:

Because these

So if you lose 15 days, you are losing

The owners will not tolerate it,
What you are really arguing is there can't

be any suspension by a summary process.
MR. FARAIDO:

I am arguing that from the decision

in this case below, and from the due process decisions of this
Court before, where there is no ability for retroactive payment,
where there is not something that can be restored by a post-

31

termination hearings I think that due process would require some
kind of hearing.

What was given to my client was absolutely

no hearing.
I have heard my brother refer to it as a 'bonference
type informal hearing."

But we were not given,at that stage,

if that is Indeed what that was, any evidence of the positive.
We still don't know whether or not this horse had the substance
they claim in its system.

We have no way of knowing that.

And if we had been given some kind of Rearing,maybe we could have
at least established that fact.
QUESTION:

What would you think the standard would

be in a pre-suspension hearing, or hearing within 48 hours of
a suspension?

Pending some full evidentiary hearing, would the

standard be simply probable cause to believe? That's all it
was in Bell v. Burson.
.. MR, FARAIDO:

I think there would be a question of

probable cause to believe, at the very minimum, yes.
QUESTION:

That would satisfy, do you think?

MR. FARALDO:

I think at the very minimum, but X

think that in view of the type of injury that is caused —
QUESTION:

I know, but in Bell v. Burson

probable

cause to believe that you are at fault in an accident and you
lose your driver's license, you may lose your job, because you
can't get there.
MR. FARAIDO:

Yes, but under the presumption, if the

32

Court accepts the presumptions, as irrebuttable presumptions,
then the probable cause that something was found in the system
would end the entire case.

Innocence or guilt of the party

would not be relevant at that juncture.
QUESTION:

Suppose he showed that he was in the

hospital for the past three days?
MR. FARAIDO:

Under the terms of the rule, as inter-

preted by New York and some other jurisdictions, he would be
suspended no matter where he was, no matter what -—
QUESTION:

At least he could show that at a hearing.

MR. FARAIDO:

Yes, he could show that at a hearing,

but so long as he was the trainer of the horse, he, again, would
be suspended under the interpretation of the statute.
Now, my brother has argued that, as a matter of
course, these stays are given to trainers and the Board has
the power and its discretion.to grant stays.

I think that was

in response to a question of Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

In the

cases that I have had with>thls Board, they have argued vigor­
ously before state courts that the statute absolutely prohibited
their granting a stay, under any circumstances.

They have also

argued to the courts of our state that the statute prohibited
the courts from issuing a stay.
QUESTION:

What have the state courts responded to

those arguments?
MR. FARAIDO:

In some instances, the state courts

33
have gone along with the argument of the New York State Racing
and Wagering Board and refused to grant any stay.
QUESTION:

What about in the other instances?

MR. FARAIDO:

In the instances of thoroughbred

racing* the stays are commonly granted in New York.

Section

401 of the State Administrative Procedure Act* which became
effective after this case* says that summary suspensions are
allowed in instances where there is a finding made that an
emergency exists or that the health* welfare of society commands
a summary suspension.

So* what we have been given in Bare hi

by the three*»judge court below* has now been modified in our
own State law.
My brother makes reference to a case, Gerard
which applied Section 401 to another racing incident.

v Barry
That case

he notes in his brief was an application by the Appellate
Division of that section to this horse- racing: industry, «which
was erroneous.

And he points to the fact of the Court of

Appeals -- there was an appeal pending in that case to the
Court of Appeals.

That decision of the Court of Appeals, they

have dismissed the application of the Attorney General in that
court to construe that statute otherwise.
QUESTION:

Did that have the result of overturning

the decision of the Appellate Division?
MR. FARAIDO:

The Appellate Division, which went in

the same vein as Barehi in the three-judge court below, was

34
sustained by the Court of Appeals of the State of New York on
the dismissal of this appeal of Gerard .v. Barry.
QUESTION:

Was that a construction of the statute?

MR. FARAIDO:

That was a construction of a statute

which has come into existence paralleling the decision of
Bare hi ^ Section 4013 of the State Administrative Procedure Act*
and that has been given the official imprimatur of our courts,
our highest court of appeals.
QUESTION:

So* the statute involved here is no

longer in effect?
MR. FARAIDO:

The statute has not been changed by

the New York State Legislature, but Section 401 of the State
Administrative Procedure Act, which gives the same kind of
guarantees that the three-judge constitutional court gave to
these licensees, has now been made the law in the State of
New York.
QUESTION:

Would you suggest it would be un­

constitutional if New York simply made trainers liable for the
condition of the horse and suspended them without proof of
fault?
MR. FARAIDO:
QUESTION:

I believe that in each situation

If a trainer has custody of the horse,

the state says if the horse is proved to have drugs in it,
that’s the end of the matter, that's the trainer's responsi­
bility

35
MR. FARAIDO:

I think that you have made one

assumption in your statement and that is: if the trainer had
control of the horse.

Had the trainer the exclusive care*

custody and control of the horse* I would have no objection —
QUESTION:

Or* if the state made him responsible

for the exclusive care and custody,
MR. FARALDO:

Well* by legislative flat* I don't

think that they could deprive him of his constitutional rights.
In other words, if they establish such a presumption, or enacted
such a statement of strict liability, they still would have to
show some control,
QUESTION:

As I understand the District Court, it

didn't say the presumptions were irrebuttable.

It said they

were rebuttable, which means that it turns on some kind of
fault, doesn't it, rather than some absolute liability?
MR. FARAIDO: Yes, it does, but X think that the
section the court below was taking into consideration was the
one that says the trainer is responsible and must guard and care
for his horse.
Upon oral argument, when I was asked if that were
rebuttable, I myself agreed that that were a rebuttable pre­
sumption, but the presumptions that the drug -- just finding a
foreign substance in the horse’s urine, was -- raises a pre­
sumption that it was administered within 48 hours of a race.
I find no rational connection with that on the mere fact of the

36

finding of a foreign substance in the horse's urine.
QUESTION:

Mr. Faraldo, my home state of Arizona has

a statute that makes the registered owner of an automobile
liable for damage caused by anyone operating it, unless it is
actually stolen,, and you don't have to show that he loaned it
to anybody.

You don't have to show that he had anything to do

with the operation of it or knowledge of it.

Do you think that

sort of a statute is unconstitutional?
MR. FARALDO:

Well, I think that that has been

dictated to us by insurance considerations and other considera­
tions.
per se.

It doesn't become then a taking from that individual,
Unless Arizona has something other than mandatory —
QUESTION:

Arizona is bound by the United States

Constitution in the same way New York is and the same way the
District Court — the same Constitution that the District Court
was interpreting in this case.

Do you think New York can't

make a trainer absolutely liable for any horse which he under­
takes to train?
MR. FARALDO: No, I do not, because I do not see a
rational connection with the fact of his control.

All of

these statutes, on strict liability, in my opinion, are based
upon the fact that the person ;vho is held liable or responsible,
has the control or -- has the control of the thing which caused
the injury in a particular case.

Now, it may be a. little more

remote in the case of an automobile, but in the case of a

37
harness racing trainer* or any trainer of horses,the facts show
that many people have access* many people have control* many
people* for whatever reason* can, in some way, get some sub­
stance to a horse.

If a trainer slept with the horse for 24

hours a day — the dissent in Sandstrom v, California, which
was a California Supreme Court decision -- if he slept with his
horse 24 hours a day, I could see a rational basis to do it,
but it is not within human experience to do such a thing.
QUESTION:
horses.

Now, we are dealing with doping of

How would you handle it, to prevent it?
MR. FARAIDO:

Well, I think the state of the

scientific art in horse racing and chemistry is sufficient
enough to place the time of administration within fixed par- amaters.

I believe within those fixed parameters a trainer

who generally is at or in attendance of his horse during
certain periods of time can be held liable upon proof of
administration during the period of time when he generally is
about and has control of the horse.
QUESTION:

Prove that he administered the drug?

MR. FARAIDO:
QUESTION:

No, I think on that basis --

I have never heard of them out in the

public doing it.
MR. FARAIDO:

I think what you would have to prove,

sir, is that the drug was apparently administered during a
period of time when he had control and/or custody of the horse.

33
QUESTION:
question* Counsel,,

Vie aren't here to review the medical
I am sure you know that.

This regulation

is presumptively valid, and we have to assume it was based on
some medical veterinarian's advice.

So, that's not an issue in

this case here.
MR. FARALDO:

No, but the assumption, as far as the

question — the presumption, so far as it puts the liability
from the mere finding of the substance in the horse's urine,
I think, is part of the case, as a result of the Inquiry by
Mr. Justice White as to whether or not a probable cause hearing
would suffice.
I think since the State of New York has established
procedures to give a full adjudicatory proceeding, although
at not a meaningful time, that there is no additional cost or
expense or burden to the State of New York.

In this particular

case, they let 18 days go by, while they espouse in this Court
the need for summary action, for 18 days there was no action
taken by this Commission in this case,
QUi23TION:

They gave you a couple of tests, or at

least one, and as far as we know, they investigated.
MR. FARALDO:
did absolutely nothing.

And as far as X-know, they
So far as I know, they-asked us if

we would take a polygraph exam, and as is customary in racing
commissions, if a person should fail a polygraph exam, they
will hold him responsible, and if he does pass a polygraph exam

39
they will discard the results.
QUESTION:

How did you know you passed the exam?

What did they say to you?
MR. FARALDO:

They said we passed the exam and that

they knew we had nothing to do with it, but they insisted on
suspending us anyway.

They alleged the need to protect the

public.
QUESTION:

Is that part of the record, what they

said to you?
MR. FARAIDO:

In the affidavit of Mr. Daly, which has

been alluded to before, there is a statement that when it was
not able to be determined who was responsible for this incident,
Mr. Barchi was suspended under the basis of the trainees
responsibility rule.

I think that's pretty much a fair quote

of his statement.
QUESTION:

I am not sure I am clear about tie change

in the New York procedure — what did you call it?
MR. FARAIDO:

The State Administrative Procedure Act,

sir.
QUESTION:

Now, what is the effect of that?

Does

that mean in the future 8022 suspensions must be preceded by
a hearing?
MR. FARALDO:
in essence what it means.

Well, what it — Yes, sir, that is
It means that unless there is a

finding that the public welfare or safety is in jeopardy, by

40

continuing this licensing -QUi2STI0N:

Help me out this way.

Suppose that law,

that amendment had been in effect when all this happened.
What would Mr. Bare hi have got?...
MR. FARAIDO:

Mr. Barchi would have got a full:/',

adjudicatory hearing prior to the taking.
QUESTION:

When would that have been?

In the

context of this case.
MR. FARAIDO:
QUESTION:

I don't understand --

There was an 18~day period of investi­

gation before the suspension, was there not?
MR. FARAIDO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And what would have happened if that

amendment had been in effect in this case?
MR. FARAIDO:

Well, Mr. Barchi would have been given

notice of charges and an opportunity to respond.

MR» FARALDO:

If they could substantiate that»then

State Administrative Procedure Law» I would agree with that»
Yes» sir»
QUESTION:

All you asked for here was the declaratory

judgment that the then existing New York procedures were un­
constitutional?
MR» FARAIDO:

On the grounds of due process and on

the grounds of violation of equal protection of law.

I would

like to address myself to that issue.
The thoroughbred statute» or the statute that governs
thoroughbred racing is New York Unconsolidated Law 7915«

It is

identical to the language of Section 8022» but in 7915 one very
serious sentence is left out»

And that is:

"Pending full

review by the Commission» the action of the judges or the
agents of the Commission» shall remain in full force and
effect,"

That section is completely omitted from that itfhich

governs thoroughbred racing in the State of New York.

42

Now*

the Attorney General argues that they

need the summary power, while they waited 18 days In this case,
the parallel section governing thoroughbred racing to which the
state should have the same interest, does not contain the
statutory prohibition.

And on that basis an equal protection

It is pari­

It is everything that is involved in thorough­

bred racing.
To take one class of thoroughbred racing personnel
and give them just about the rights that I feel are guaranteed
under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution,
and take another group in the same industry, with all the same
considerations and the same ramifications, and say that they
should not be given due process of law -QUESTION:

Isn't there some suggestion, though, that

there has been an aura of corruption around harness racing that
has not been true of thoroughbred racing?
MR. FARAIDO:

The statement made by the Attorney

General is that in 195^ there were some labor union disruptions
or activities at Yonkers Raceway, X think it was, or in harness
racing in the State of New York, what that has to do with
trainers and owners who participate at the race track itself, I

43
cannot understand.

If it had some rational relationship* if*

as they say* harness racing were more corrupt than thoroughbred
racing* then I could see a need for some more severe modes of
procedure* vis-a «vis harness racing licensees.

But I don't see

a rational connection between what is asserted to be labor
union activities in the 1950s and the denial of a hearing to a
harness racing trainer.

I cannot make that connection.

I believe that the equal protection argument is a
substantial argument and -- •
QUESTION;

Your statutes did develop separately*

didn't they?
MR. PARAXDO;

Yes* they did.

As a matter of fact*

the State Investigation Commission* in June of 1976* noted that
there were procedural differences which did not have any
rational basis* and that once the State Racing and Wagering
Board was consolidated — in other words, once the Harness
Racing Commission and Thoroughbred Commission were brought under
one roof* that the Hew York State Racing and Wagering Board
ought to work to alleviate those differences where they appear.
But there is no factual basis for treating the harness racing
personnel different than thoroughbred racing personnel.
I think the equal protection argument is very
substantial here.

MR. FARAIDO:

The Hamiltonian is at DeCoyne and it

is under the jurisdiction of the Illinois Racing Board.
QUESTION:

I am asking, do you know whether Illinois

has statutes or regulations similar to those in New York?
MR. FARAIDO:

They do not.

They have, as a matter

of fact, struck down as unconstitutional the strict liability

provision# holding that in Brennan v, Illinois Racing and
Wagering Board in 1969 — Illinois struck it down, saying that

trainer or his actual culpable conduct,

The New York Court of Appeals, on

purely procedural grounds, unrelated to the substance of the
statute —
QUESTION:
MR. HAMMER:

Does the opinion make that clear?
All you have are single orders, without

any opinion whatever.
QUESTION:
MR. HAMMER:

Does the order make that clear?
As a matter of New York jurisprudence,

any New York lawyer would understand this,
I think it would be clear from an examination of the
New York statutes »» It would be Article 56 of the New York Civil
Practice law and Rules, relating to the jurisdiction of the
New York Court of Appeals.

I think Cohen and Carter, "Powers

of the New York Court of Appeals," which is somewhat dated, but

47
Is fche definitive treatise., would also make this clear* just
as e denial of certiorari «—
QUESTION:

General Hammer* would it be true that

fche decision of fche Appellate Division of fche New York Supreme
Court was consistent with Mr, Justice Powelles understanding
of New York Law* or suggested understanding?
MR, HAMMER:

No* sir». I would have to disagree*

because, in our view, a druged horse situation would automatic»
ally qualify as a ground for summary suspension of a licensee*
even if the New York Administrative Procedure Act appliese

And

I think there is still a substantial question whether, as a
law
matter of New York/ whether the Administrative Procedure Act
would apply to this case, notwithstanding Gerard,
QUESTION:

And that would be your view, even if the

Appellate Division decision had been by fche Court of Appeals,
rather than the Appellate Division?
MR® HAMMER:

Well, if it had been the Court of

Appeals, the Court of Appeals is the last word on New York law,
but this was not,,
QUESTION:

You are saying the opinion itself doesn't

hold vrhat counsel says it holds.
MR. HAMMER:

Counsel is correct in his summarization

of what the Appellate Division held, but this is not, we submit,
what New York law is, or should be.
QUESTION:

Because the Appellate Division Is not the

48
court of last resort?
MR» HAMMER:
QUESTION:

That is correct* Your Honor»
But it is the highest court of the State

of New York which has spoken to this issue
MR» HAMMER:
QUESTION:

of state lawc

That is correct.
Is it also because the Appellate Division

case did not involve a drugged horse?
MR. HAMMER:

In this case* the Appellate Division

involved the so-called ''sting1' case* a switching, where the
veterinarian was ultimately convicted on some violation and*
in fact* sentenced to prison for a year.
I would simply say that counsel in his presentation
1

has alluded to many things idiieh (inaudible) the record* or
which really raise questions of fact.

This we feel* as we had

urged the three-judge court* should have held further hearings.
Yes* there is irreparable injury* perhaps* when a
trainer is summarily suspended, but we would submit* Your
Honors* that the decisions of this Court and* more important*
the rationale of these decisions uphold such a suspension as
a matter of due process.

And we would accordingly urge that

the judgment below be reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon* at 1:59 o'clock* p»in0* the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted0)
