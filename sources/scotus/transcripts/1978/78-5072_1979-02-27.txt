BEHALF OF TEE PETITIONER

?*S. SHTASELs
may it please the Court:

Thank you? Mr. Chief Justice? and
My name is Sana Shtasel? appearing

for the petitioner in the case this morning.
The case before you today arises on writ of
certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit.

The basic question is whether a cause of

action for money damages may be implied under the Fifth
Amendment to address sex discrimination in Federal employment.

15

If that question is answered in the affirmative, -this Court
16

then must determine whether respondent is nonetheless
17

absolutely immune from suit by virtue of the Speech or Debate
18

Clause of the Constitution.
19

The facts of this case are simple and stark.
20
Petitioner was employed by respondent? then a United States
21

Congressman? for a 6-months period in 1974.

Despite the fact

22
that petitioner was an able? energetic? and extremely
23

capable secretary? as attested to by the respondent in his
24

letter of dismissal? which appears in the appendix in this

4
1

case at pages 6 and 7, respondent dismissed petitioner solely*,.

2

explicitly, and expressly because he wanted a man rather

3

than a woman to fill that position.
QUESTION;

14

As a secretary?

So he has described

her.
MS. SHTASEL;

The title of the position, Mr.

Justice Blackmun,, was deputy administrative assistant.

But

it is the functions of the job that are in question here, and
no one has ever contended that the petitioner did anything
other than secretarial function.

That is exactly how her

job was described in the letter terminating her employment,
which is the only thing we have on the record in this case.
Petitioner therefore brought suit alleging —
QUESTION;

Do you think it would make a difference

if her tasks were secretarial exclusively or administrative
15

IS
17

assistant at least in part?
MS. SHTASEL:

It might make a difference, Mr.

Justice, when wa get to the question of the operation of the
18
19

20

Speech or Debate Clause.

It should not make a difference as

to whether the petitioner has a cause of action under the
Fifth Amendment.

Whether, however, her job functions would

21

be so integral to the Congressman’s legislative functions

22
that the employment relationship should nonetheless be
23

covered with absolute immunity is a question which must be
24

addressed there.
25

5
Our position, however , is that there is no way

1

2

that the Speech or Debate Clause can apply to a low-level,

3

non-policy-making, clerical employee»

4

case arises on 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, so that our

5

contentions here in the procedural posture of this case

6

must be taken to be the ones applicable.

White.

That is in the record, Mr. Justice

Her salary was $18,000 a year.
QUESTION;

That sounds like something other than

a low-level clerical employee, doesn’t it?
MS. SHTASEL:

It sounds like it, your Honor, but

when one consults the report of the clerk of the House for
that period and time, it's quite clear that some 75 other
Representatives had secretaries, personal secretaries,
executive secretaries all making that kind of salary and,
indeed, there are other cases where Members employed persons
called secretaries who made more than the administrative
assistant that they also employed.
QUESTION:

When was this?

MS. SHTASEL:

M-j . SHTASEL:
through July in 1974.

She was employed from February

6

1

QUESTION:

Her salary may be fixed by each

2

individual Member of the House and Senate without any

3

standards, is that not so?

4

MS. SHTASELs , That is true, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

QUESTION;

In soma cases they level

it off and

6

divide the work among several people, and in other cases they

7

have a very high-salaried secretary; is that true?

3
9
10
11

MS. SHTASELs

My understanding is that they

are

allotted a maximum of 18 slots, which can be filled at their
discretion and with salaries at their discretion.
QUESTION:

Well, they are allotted 18 positions and

12

X thousands of dollars, and they may spread the salaries as

13

they wish, is that not so?

14

MS. SHTA5EL:

15

Petitioner, following her termination, brought suit

That is correct.

16

alleging that she had been a victim of sex discrimination

17

in violation of the Fifth Amendment, premising jurisdiction

18

upon 28 U.S.C. Section 1331(a).

19

!

The district court dismissed this case, holding that

20

plaintiff had no private cause of action.

A panel of the

21

1 iffch Circuit of Appeals reversed on that issue and then
proceeded to canvass all the related constitutional issues.
It held, as had the district court, that no immunity doctrine
would bar this suit.
Rehearing en banc was held to assess whether the

7
1

doctrines of legislative immunity and poliitcal question,,

z

which. I might add had been raised for the first time by the

3

panel*, were applicable to this case.

4

however* did not decide that question.

5

an issue that had not been briefed before the panel* had

S

been conceded by respondent at the panel* and had neither

7

been raised by the respondent on rehearing nor briefed by him

Q

in that proceeding.

The en banc court*
Rather* it decided

\

!
The court held that an implied cause of action

9

so

does not arise under the Fifth Amendment to the United

ii

States Constitution* and accordingly that petitioner should

12

have no remedy whatever to vindicate her fundamental

13

constitutional rights.
The validity of that decision is the first

14
15

question for this Court’s determination today.
For the reasons stated in our briefs to this

16

18

Court* this case is controlled by Bivens v. Six Unknown Named
.
Federal Bureau of Narcotics. In Bivens this

19

’.oust held* first* that the petitioner had a private cause

20

ol

17

21

22
23
24

25

action for damages arising directly under the Fourth

Amendment; second* that the Federal right was independent
from any State rights that might be implicated; and*third*
mon©y damages were a remedial mechanism normally available
in the Federal courts.
the seven and a half years since Bivens was

j

8

1

decided, nine courts of Appeals and countless district courts

2

have applied Bivens to constitutional amendments other than

3

the fourth and to Federal officials other than narcotics

4

agents.

5

QUESTION;

Counsel, some of us were in dissent

on Bivens.

7

necessarily unsympathetic to your posture here?

a
9

Do you think that blocks us in and makes us

MS. SHTASELs

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I would be

delighted if the dissenters in Bivens were persuaded that a

10

cause of action should be applied under the facts of this

n

case.

12

the rationale of the courts that have applied Bivens in the

13

succeeding years is sufficient to suggest that we can apply

14

a cause of action under Bivens here.

15

are other factors in this case which make it perhaps a

16

stronger case than Bivens for the implication of a cause of

17

action for money damages under the Constitution.

I think that the rationale of the Bivens majority and

QUESTION;

18

Indeed, as well, there

We do try to be individually consistent.

19

What I am asking is, is there any escape for those of us who

20

were in dissent in Bivens?
MS. SHTASELs

21

I would suggest one, Mr. Justice

22

Blackmun.

23

expressly spoken on the guestion in the Fourth Amendment case,

24

In this case Congress has affirmatively declared in 5 U.s.C.

25

One of the concerns was that Congress had not

discriminated against»

2

Court needs to look or wants to look to congressional

declaration in the area, it is apparent.

4
5

Accordingly, to the extent that this

As a second possibility, Mr. Justice, there was

8

some concern by the Bivens dissenters that the Federal
““
courts would be subjected to an avalanche of cases. Indeed,

7

there have been almost eight years of Federal litigation in

0

this area and no court other than "the en banc court below

9

has suggested that there is a problem of judicial urananage-

'

10

ability in this area.
QUESTION

11

%

Yes, but you just made reference to a

12

number of cases in this area where the courts had gone in

13

your favor.

MS. SHTASELs

14

15
16
17

So there is some litigation.
There is extensive litigation in

the area.

j
QUESTION:

Doesn’t some of your answer to Mr.

Justice Blackman cut the other way in the sense that although

18

the statute is on the books, the general kind of hortatory

19

statute. Congress has quite carefully considered whether it

20

wanted to make its Members subject to, say, title 7 the way

21

Executive Branch members are, or whether it wanted to subject
its Members to any particular strictures in their hiring and
firing, and they simply have not done it.

They have
’

considered it and rejected it.
MS. SHTASEL:

Our argument, Mr. Justice Reimquist,

1

is that Congress cannot mandate no remedy for violations of

2

constitutional rights.

3

never suggested that there should be no judicial remedy for

4

this kind of violation. 4Indeed, it has not brought

5

congressional employees under the ambit of title 7 and it

6

could certainly enact legislation which would so provide and,

7

indeed, even protect its own Members from the possibility of

8

personal liability, which has been done in other contents.

9

QUESTION?

And indeed, in this case, it has

Well, that proposition may be entirely

10

sound, but it doesn’t seem to me that it really makes your

11

case a stronger one than Bivens, as you suggested to Mr.

12

Justice Blackmun.

13

MS. SHTASELs

In Bivens there was no congressional

14

policy stated in the area.

15

a congressional hortatory statute which declares what the

16

policy of the United States is to be.

17

In this case at the most we have

Moving along, I would suggest that the court below

18

does stand alone in the face of this authority, and in doing

19

so, in refusing to imply a constitutional cause of action,

20

the en banc court did erroneously look to the criteria

21

enumerated in Cort v. Ash for implication of remedies from

22

Federal statutes.

23

a different route.

24

-actors might counsel hesitation in the absence of affirmative

25

action by Congress and argues that Some seven special factors

The respondent reaches the same result by
He uses the proviso of Bivens that special

Each of the court criteria and each of the special

2

3

factors relied upon by the respondent are addressed in our

4

brief.

5

justifies dismissal of petitioner's complaint in this case.

6

We would suggest that the respondent is correct to the

None of them* either alone or in. combination*

.

7

extent that he acknowledges that it is Bivens that controls

8

this case.
As I just mentioned in response to Mr. Justice

9
10

Rehnquist, we think the court below erred in relying on

11

Cart Wo Ash because those criteria are irrelevant when a

12

constitutional right rather than a right created by a

13

Federal statute is at issue.
For the reasons we have outlined* however* at

14
15

pages 26 to 36 of our opening brief, application of the

16

Cort criteria would require recognition of a private cause

17

of action nonetheless on the facts of this case.

I don’t, think that the analysis

Well, they are really provisions of

MS. SHTASEL:

That is true, Mr. Justice White, but

12

many classifications, or at least several, have been deemed

13

by this Court to rise to the level of being constitutionally

14

safeguarded and thus subject to equal protection scrutiny.

15

QUESTION:

They are invalid if they are

of the case, Mr. Justice Stewart, in suggesting that
constitutional rights must be implied,or remedies for them,
from the Constitution because without that implication of
a cause of action, those rights would be reduced to meaning­
less rhetoric.

There would be no enforcement mechanism for

ensuring those guarantees.

MS. SHTASELs

3

I think in that context, Mr. Chief

4

Justice, other kinds of balancing factors come into play.

5

What you are talking about there are political concerns which

6

might govern action in this area because indeed elective

1

representatives have historical and constitutional functions

8

to represent certain constituencies and to represent certain

9

positions.

In that: context we ara not talking about a case of

10

invidious discrimination, nor are we talking about a case

11

where performance or job-relatedness is the issue.

12

quite different from a case where, based on nothing more,

13

a Member of Congress explicitly stated that only a man could

14

fill a position that without question has very typically been

held by women.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleases

the Courts

We submit that a Bivens cause of action should

MR. GEAR;

1 am suggesting that there should be

no cause of action against Congress until Congress suggests

21

that, sir, because we have separation of power principles

complaint asking for a declaratory judgment that the
statute was unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, either

The Court said that it is

They went so far

as to say that the day-to-day work of the legislative staff
was so critical to the legislative performance that staff
members are alter ©goes of the Members of Congress.
