MR. CHlJiP JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 961* New York Telephone Company against
the New York Atafce department of labor.
Mr. Ben eta r* you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. BENETAR* ESQ.*
ON BLRA LF OF THE PETITIONARY
MR. BENETAR:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
This case brings up for review a judgment of the
Court of Appeals for the second Circuit reversing United States
District Court for the southern District judgment after a trial
a nine-day trial* holding that New York State statute granting
unemployment compensation to strikers was unconstitutional,.
The reversal reinstated the statute.
Under the statute* payments are mad® to strikers
after seven weeks waiting period* plus the one v;eek required
of all claimants for compensation.

The coat of unemployment

insurance* or compensation* is borne by the employer against
whom the strike is Galled.
After the trial* the District Court -- and I'll
briefly* very briefly* sketch the outstanding holdings* or
findings* of the District Court ~~ the statute* he held* was
in direct and substantial conflict with the national policy
of neutrality on the part of the Government insofar as economic

4

contests are concerned in the field of collective bargaining,,
He held that the state intervention on behalf of strikers was
causing employers to finance strikes against themselves.
Therefore, he held that the lav/ was preempted by the National
Labor Relations Act, as amended, under the Supremacy Clause
of the Constitution.
The substantial impact of New York's law on bargain­
ing and strikes was evidenced — if, indeed, it isn't selfevident

by documentary proof emanating in considerable

measure from involved unions, those involved in this strike
and major unions, generally, in the country.

From economic

data, from expert opinion and from employers 8 views and perhaps
most concretely, it was evidenced from the fact that $49 million
dollars in unemployment compensation was paid out in the course
of the particular strike which led up to this lawsuit.
Now, the second Circuit accepted the findings of
the District Court.

They acknowledged the conflict which the

District Court found between the national policy of neutrality
and the state statute in question.

Nevertheless, although they

said in their words ‘'that a positive expression of congres­
sional intent is lacking," nevertheless they said, "We will
reverse because by resorting to inference we find that Congress
intended to tolerate this conflict" and that they saw this
whole area of payment to strikers as one inviting to state
experimentation on a state by state basis.

Uncertain and ambiguous legislative history which
we contend is all there is in this case* falls far short of
the standard of clarity that is required to justify an in­
vasion of the neutrality principle,,
QUESTION:

Mr* Benefcar* v/ould your position be the

same If this were unemployment benefits for a lockout that was
called by the employer?
MR, BiiNxfTAR:

I think that on principle the position

would have to be the same.

But in the case of a lockout* 1

am not aware of the same kind of statistics concerning impact*
concerning frequency* for example,
just not comparable in numbers,

strikes and lockouts are

do I would want to look into

that question because we* in this case* developed impact very
thoroughly.

But* on principle* as I said at the opening of

my answer* I think they would both have to be controlled by
the same considerations,
QUESTION:

Would you think the same would be true

of welfare payments which are financed by the taxpayers*
generally* rather than the employer?
MR, Bi3Ni3TAR:

No* I would not* sir,

I would not,

I see welfare -QUESTION:

How doss it differ in its impact on the

neutrality principle that you were discussing?
MR, BSNhTAR;

In a few ways.

And what happened in

this case sort of dramatizes the difference* because there were

6
335ooo workers who collected unemployment compensation and
1*000 who applied for welfare.

Nov/* the difference that I

see — The differences are manifold.

Number one* unemployment

insurance Is fixed* certain and promised.
coming after a certain number of weeks.

You know that it Is
You know the amount.

Number two* there is no needs test* because unemployment com­
pensation wasn't intended* in its origins -- Congress wasn't
thinking in its origins about needs* except those created by
the great depression when people were looking for work and
couldn't find it.

do* there is no needs test.

And* finally* if the Court pleases* welfare is not
subsidized* paid for by the very employer against whom the
strike is being called and maintained.
QUESTION:

How do you distinguish its impact on the

neutrality principle?
MR. BENETA R:

Well* in our case* as Your Honor can

see from the figures* the impacts of welfare and unemployment
insurance were nowhere nearly equal.

Unemployment compensation

far outweighed the impact of welfare.
1 think there is another aspect of this and that is
that in the case of welfare one would have to consider* perhaps,
and weigh the interests of the state* if it was out and out
trying to protect welfare* not under the guise of unemployment
insurance.

But X do not see* and I have never seen any proof*

to indicate impact to the extent that I have described to the

7
Court In these few opening sentences.

If there were such

proof, perhaps, the situation might be changed, but as far as
I know and as far as I read the situation, they do stand on
a different footing.
QUESTION:

Mr. Benefcar, if you distinguish welfare,

what would you do if you had unemployment compensation financed
by the state, $49 million paid by the state instead of the
employer?

If It was financed by the state from general reven­

ues, rather than by the employer, would your cases be different?
MR» BENbTAR:
way basically altered.

It would be different, but not in any
It would be different because the

direct subsidy by the employer involved, of course, under­
scores and emphasizes the extent of the invasion of the
principle of neutrality.

You are not only helping the striker

but you are putting the burden of it on the man against whom
the strike is being called.
So, in my judgment, if the only thing that were
present were the pay out of $49 million, I would still say
that under an unemployment compensation statute this was an
unlawful and preemptive statute and that the payment should
not be made.
Now, in,’Sr way, I have said In my answers what X am
about to say now, but I think it is Important.

This case

This is no

It goes to the core of our national policy of

8
neutrality* a policy of leaving the resolution of economic
disputes to the free play of economic forces.

Congress en­

acted this comprehensive policy because* as this Court has
said* because of the perceived inadequacy of the states to
create a comprehensive and equitable way of dealing with the
adjustment between parties to labor disputes.

That was the

genesis of this* to get a Federal law that would wipe out
the state differences

and they were wide and varied -- and

make this principle of neutrality a principle across the lando
Now* as we see the precise question here* then* it
is:

Social security Act to invite the states to reenter* through

Congress had just preempted five or six weeks before in the
National labor Relations Act?

That is the time relationship

And did they intend then, within five

or six weeks* to invite the states to reenter this preempted
territory and substitute there several concepts of neutrality
and of the balance of economic forces or power in place of the
balance struck by Congress?
That is what we see as the question in the case and
we think* to a very considerable extent* it answers itself.

MR* BENETAR:

I am not aware that they have clone so*

because we are of the belief that this doesn't require any
further congressional action.

We don't think that Congress

11

ever conceived of the kind of situation we are presenting to
this Court today,, in terms of payout., in terms of double
violation of the neutrality concept,

I don't think Congress

had the remotest notion of it in 1935«
QUHSTION:

In your view., Mr, Benetar, what could

Congress do about a statute of the State of New York?
MR, BjSMSTAR:
QUBdTION:

What should it do?

What could it do?

What could be the

scope of its power if it did not like what New York State has
provided?
MR, BrJN.CTAR:

I think that the Congress would have

the right to change the concept of neutrality, but I don't
think that they could or would do that without measuring the
effect of so drastic an invasion of the forbidden area, on the
one hand, with the desire, if there v/as one

on New York's

part,to keep using unemployment compensation as the vehicle
for paying out money not on a basis of need,

I just don't

think that it would happen that way,
A few words about the strike that led to this.
Before it was over ~~ or I should say this, that on July 14,
1971, the CWA, called a nationwide strike against the Bell
System companies who were bargaining with it at that time,
including these Petitioners,

Four days later, an agreement

was reached, the union recommended it to the members, urged
ratification and it was ratified on the national basis, except

12
In New York where It was turned down and New York went on
strike *

Ultimately, the national union sort of joined the

strike in the sense that the New York authorities insisted on
conducting it so the national union went along with it*

Before

the strike was over in New York, seven months had elapsed,
$49 million were paid out to some 33,000 strikers arid the un­
employment insurance account of Telephone Company alone was
depleted by $40 million, which it was required to replace and
is in the process of replacing.
The employers were influenced to settle against
their better judgment.

This was all in the contracts which

were accepted on terns in New York which broke the national
pattern.

They.didn't want to do that, but they felt the

strikers had several more weeks, if not months, of unemploy­
ment compensation coming and there just wasn’t any use carrying
the fight any longer.
Contrasted with the $49 million paid out by the
companies by the vehicle of unemployment compensation, was
$14 million paid out of the union's strike fund.

Small wonder,

under those circumstances, that we find the union leader who
conducted the strike in New York bulletinizing his members
immediately after the strike was over and saying to them, "The
fact that we kept out 33"“"

or whatever thousand people it

was ~ >"on striket 80$ of the membership# for 218-days,'' he
says, "That fact is an incredible phenomenon, and it is due to

13

three outstanding causes:

l) dedication and spirit of the

strikerss 2) unemployment insurances, 3) the effectiveness of
the CV'A Ss strike fund."
And the strike fund rightfully took third place in
view of what I have said to you about the comparative figures
between them.
The union Involved in the strike publicly referred
to the strike as "our strike weapon."

They saw it very

realistically^ that what this was was a strike weapon, an
economic weapon.

And that's what accounted for what they

called the "phenomenon” of the 218-day holdout.
Now* it should not be supposed for a moment that
this was an isolated Instance.

According to New York labor

Department statistics, almost 10$ of the strikes over a period
of some fifteen or twenty years, published statistics, almost
10$ lasted eight weeks or more.

Thirteen point eight percent

of all employees involved in strikes were involved in such
lengthy strikes, and 51$ of all man-clays made idle by these
lengthy strikes «— or rather 51$ of all man-days made idle in
all strikes were attributable to these lengthy, more than eightweek, strikes.
QUESTION:

Mr. Benefcar, what percent of the wages

that a person earns is paid by unemployment compensation?
MR. BEN ETA R:

Up to 50$, tax free.

And testimony at

the trial was that what they get front unemployment compensation

14

is enough to take care of the necessities of life,,

It is more

than they would get from most unions in strike benefits,
considerably more.

In fact, this union stopped giving out

benefits for food as soon as unemployment compensation took
over.

They were relieved of that burden, which was rightfully

theirs if the neutrality principle is to control.
In the brief of the Rochester Telephone Company and
others as amicus here, are listed, in addition to the statis­
tics I have given you, pending actions, where other employers
of New York state have been injured by the situation I have
just been describing.
Now, the guiding principles against which the
miscellaneous items of legislative history -«• and I character­
ize them that way because I think that's what they are —
strung together, miscellaneous items, some pointing In one
direction, some pointing in another, but none of them speaking
out and saying it is Congress’ Intent to allow this as an
exception to the rule of neutrality,
QUESTION:

But at that time, Mr, Ben eta r, had the

rule of neutrality ever really been discussed by Congress?
Wasn’t that something the Court found a few years later?
MR. BBNBTAR:

I think the rule of neutrality, of

course, was discerned and laid down by this Court#and I presume
that this Court’s discernment went tc the question of what
Congress intended in the first place by it,

And as I look at

15

the picture
QULBTION:

But there isn’t much legislative history

discussing the rule of neutrality, is there?
MRe BBNLTAR:

But the legislative history summarized

in Look rich says that Congress acted because of the‘'perceived
Inability of the states to handle these problems in a unifom*
coherent manner and to balance the respective equities or
strengths of the parties."

Congress was dissatisfied with the

way one state would go one way, helping unions, and another
state would go another way, helping employers.
I believe, Mr, Justice Bfcevens^that when you look
at the structure of that Act and you see how Government acts
as a policeman, but in no place does it come into the actual
bargaining, I believe the doctrine of neutrality was implicit
in there from the date the statute was signed into law by the
President,,
I believe that when this Court announced what that
case meant, I think they were reading Congress 5 mind in the
clearest possible way.
These principles which have been discerned in this
area are that states may not legislate when a tendency to
frustrate the operation of Federal law scheme, or which creates
substantial risk of conflict with policy central to the Federal
Labor laws

Free collective bargaining,dictating Government

neutrality and banning strikes or state entry into areas left

16

to the free play of economic forces -- and* by the way* my
remarks are sprinkled with quotations from this Court „

It is

hard to talk about this subject without picking up the phrases
that have gone through the decisions here and as the Courts
through what it calle the "process of elucidating litigation"
has clarified the intent of Congress by the kind of phrases
that I have been using.

They are not mine.

Most of them are

borrowed from Supreme Court decisione.
hodge 76 tells us that this neutrality goes to the
very heart of the Federal policy.

Now the use of economic

forces by either party is part and parcel of the process* and
not a grudging exception.

If the parties look, for economic

combat* they must look to themselves to carry it on.

And this

is the catalyst which Congress and this Court looked for to
bring about settlements.
QUESTION:

Well* if they did* I don't recall
Yes* they did* but one can cite a case*

but when you read lodge 76s, there is no way* in my opinion*
of its supporting what the becond Circuit did, because the
case reaffirms in the clearest terms that what I have said is
true* and that the catalyst relied on by Congress and by this

And the Government is

not supposed to enter into that area,
'In a preemption case* such as this/'says Lodge 76*
"the crucial inquiry is whether Congress intended this field
to be unregulated because it was left to be controlled by
the free play of economic forces,"

.

;

And that's where uodge 76 was cited* Mr, Justice
Marshall, that's where it was cited by the second Circuit,
QUiiiTION:

Obviously, I knew that.

That's why I

asked the question,
MR, BLNLTAR:
QUtiiTXON:

I simply wanted to —

I was trying to find out your view of it,

MR, BdN&TAR:

Well, my view of it is. that the error

below was compounded by their recognition of the principle,
without giving it effect.

That's my view of it,

I think what

they did was to take a principle of great weight and then,from
these f ragments of so-called legislative history,* they drew/an
inference admitting that Congress had not spoken clearly on
this.

They drew an inference that Congress intended to violate

the very policy ivhich they were quoting from,
I don't think that when you take inference from
ambiguous, uncertain legislative history which points in two
directions and you pit it against the centerpiece of the
national scheme that you can come out with a result which

18

justifies the piercing or the violation or the invasion of
the national scheme.
The proven effect of the New York statute* no doubt
about it* acknowledged by the Second Circuit — They acknowl­
edged* too* that there is this conflict.

The proven effect

Is to alter the balance of power between the parties.
Let's just briefly take a look at that history* in
an overall sense, because we have briefed the details of it.
The Court of Appeals* as I’ve said* acknowledged that there Is
no positive expression of congressional intent.

The First

Circuit in Grlnnell went through that whole list of Items of
congressional history and reached the conclusion that it was
not sufficiently clear to establish congressional intent either
way.

Prior to the Second Circuit's decision in this case*

every other Federal court that considered the matter reached
the same conclusion.

1 -c

An inconclusive legislative record* we submit* is
not an adequate basis for permitting New York's interference
with Federal policy as found by the court's below.
a particularly tender area.

We are in

As Professor Cox has said* "Where

a state law is based on an accommodation of the special in­
terest® of employers* unions and employees in collective bar­
gaining* the balance struck by Congress among those same in­
terests requires exclusion* unless Congress has provided
otherwise. "

19

Congress has not provided otherwise, and there is
no reliable indication that it even intended to provide other­
wise.
The recent decision of this Court in the Malone
case stresses the question of clarity,,

How much clarity is

really needed before on© can say that a key tenet of the
Federal policy has been violated?
MR. CHlLF JUSTICE BURGfiK;

Very well.,

Mrs. Marcus.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARIA LLNHOFF MARCUs , LdQ. ,
ON BLHALF OF TUB RLLPGNLLNTS
Mfc. MARClb:

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it please

the Court:
I am Maria l, Marcus, Special Assistant Attorney
General, representing Respondents here.
Preemption is a doctrine designed to give effect to
congressional intent^ not to overcome it.

As the unanimous

decision of the Second Circuit in this case points out, the
key to that intent is in the Social security Ac!;, not in the
National Labor Relations Act, for the NLRA contains no specific
direction as to the extent to which states are permitted to
regulate labor-management controversies.
Now, when Congress faces up to the preemption
question in enacting second law, this Court has looked to the
more pertinent Federal provision in disposing of preemption

20

cla 1ms 0
A most recent example of this was in Malone v „ White
Motor Corpus where the employer.» like Petitioners here* argued
that the NLRA Ss policy of free collective bargaining was absol­
ute* and that* therefore* the state statute there*which actually
altered the term of the collective bargaining agreement, must
violate the Federal regulatory scheme and be struck down0
This Court upheld the state's right to act* pointing
to the Welfare Pension Plans 'disclosure Act as a better Indicia
of congressional intento
Petitioners here say that this Court should simply*
on the basis of the general preemption principles derived from
the NLRA* hold that tha state has no right to give unemployment
benefits to strikers.

Congress directly faced this question

in enacting the Social Security Act and it decided that with
three very narrow exceptions* that the state was free to grant
such benefits or to refuse to do so.
Social Security Act received its impetus* as this
Court has recognized* from the President's Committee on Economic
Security* whose Advisory Council said* "When you enact the
Social Security Act* don't let the states pay unemployment
benefits to strikers."

Senator Wagner* who was the sponsor of

both the NLRA and Social Security Acts and who was also the
first witness in the hearings on the Social Security Act*' took
a different view.

He said* "There should be practically no

21

restrictions on the states in the kind of programs that they
can write*"
Now, Congress ultimately did pass some restrictions
dealing with payment of unemployment compensation during
strikes, but aside from those restrictions, consciously left
the rest to the states for determination*

It was extremely

important at that time that all the states pass unemployment
compensation laws, because if they didn't the purpose of the
docial .security Act would have been frustrated*

And to make

sure that all of the states came into the field Congress en­
acted extremely strong and elaborate incentives to induce the
states to come in*
The Senate Finance Committee report, in explaining
the approach of Congress passing the Social Security Act, said
that they wanted the states to proceed without dictation from
Washington, and they recognized New York,whose statute was
already in existence in substantially the same form as we have
it today, as one of the kind of laws that they sought to en­
courage the other states to pass*
Now, as far as the experience rating aspect, which
Counsel has referred to and which Mr* Justice Marshall asked
about, the fact is that on the face of New York's law it was
already indicated that New York was contemplating passing such
a provision*

And, what is more important, Congress itself

wanted all the states to have experience rating provisions and

22

included incentives to persuade the states to put experience
rating into all their laws.

So, they wanted the states to

proceed on that basis.
The Social Security Act and the National Labor
Relations Act were passed during the same five-week period, by
the same Congress sitting in the same session.
There is no preemption here.

There is not a vestig©

of support in the legislative history of the National Labor
Relations Act for any such preemption.

The National Labor

Relations Board, through the agency in charge of interpreting
and enforcing the law, says that there is no preemption here,
as does the United states of America, who was coma in on the
same brief, as amicus curiae in this Court.
The question of preemption is not, as Counsel has
been indicating, a constitutional principle.

This Court said,

in Retail Clerks v. ^ perm .thorn that preemption is merely a
rationalization of the coexistence of Federal and state
agencies in the same labor relations field.

It Is not a con«

stifcufcional principle at all.
QUESTION:

Well, preemption, generally, is a con­

stitutional principle, stemming from the Supremacy Clause.
MRS. MARCUSs

It becomes a constitutional matter by

virtue of the fact that if the two laws are inconsistent then
the Federal law is stronger, but ~QUESTION:

That"s because of the Constitution of the

23

United States and specifically the Supremacy Clause.,
MRS. MARCUS:

But what this Court meant in stating,

directly stating ~~ I am quoting from, the decision that pre­
emption is not a constitutional principle — It simply meant
that the idea of not having the states in the field at all is
not part of the preemption concept.

The preemption concept

simply points to what Congress had In mind.

Congress, the

ultimate touchstone of deciding whether in fact it wishes to
have some state regulation, have a great deal or to have none
at all.
Mow, in the Social Security Act, the incentives
that I referred to were a really very strong either-or.

And

to give you the idea of what that either~or was, for the states
that refused to pass a law, this is what would happen.

Their

employers would have to pay a 3$ payroll tax on a portion of
the salaries of all their employees, and that money would never
be returned to the states in any form, but would simply go to
the Federal Government, in fact, support unemployment insurance
programs in other states.

That's what would happen if the

state refused to pass an unemployment compensation law.
j

On the other hand, if it passed one, each employer
would receive a 90$ tax credit, which he would receive merely
by virtue of paying the state tax, whatever that state tax
was.

Whether the state tax was at the maximum the state set

or nothing at all, he would still receive that 90$ tax credit.

24

And the other 10$ which was not wiped out by the credit would®
in any event® be returned to the state® either to support
Federal benefits or to help administer the program»
iao® that was an extremely pervasive kind of in­
centive»

In fact® so much so that the law was challenged

as usurping state powers® as coercing the states to come into
the field»

And this Court considered that question in Stewart

v. Machine Company and it decided that® yes® these were very
pervasive incentives® but because of the latitude given to the
states in developing their own program® that Congress was en­
titled to keep those incentives in the law,
So® Congress has®, from the very inception of both
the NLRA and the Social Security Act® considered the inter­
relation of unemployment insurance and the economics of labor
disputes.
QUESTION:

Now® you say® as though that statement

followed from what you have told us.

It doesn* ; seem, to me

that it does.
MRS. MARCUS:

Well® from the very beginning they had

what was a strong and flat-out recommendation by the very group
that was the impetus for the passage of the law, "Don't let
the states pay."
And what Congress did at that point was say® "Well®
we are going to look into that area® and we will put down some
restrictions®" which they did.

25
QUESTION:

What were those restrictions?

MR; o MARCUc :

Those restrictlons, for example* were

that if a worker refused to seek new or accept new work at
a struck job that he couldn't be dciniad unemployment benefits.
Also —
QUESTION:

That if he failed to seek new work he

could be denied?
MRi 0 MARCUS:
kind of new work.

In other words, the question of what

Under all unemployment plans, under all

state laws, a person is obliged to seek other work -.QUESTION:

To seek new comparable work.

MRO o MARCUS: -- and what Congress wanted to make sure
of is that the state didn't say to this worker, "You've got a
possible job.

You can go and work at X plant which is being

struck by its employees."

And Congress said, "No, you can't

deny benefits to somebody because they refuse to work for an
employer who is involved in a labor controversy 0"
And the other restrictions involved such things as
not permitting denial of benefits for somebody v/ho refused to
work for less than the prevailing wage in the area, and refused
to join a place where they were not allowed to be union members.
So, those were some of the restrictions which Congress did im­
pose, and which were in the area of lab or “management contro­
versy, but they refused to go along with the recommendation of
the President's Committee, despite its preeminent position as

26

the actual impetus of the whole Act.
QUESTION: To prsv©at any state plan from allowing
payment of unemployment compensation to strikers.
MRs » MARCUS:

To prevent any state plan from paying

under the various options that already exists from paying
unemployment compensation.
QUESTION:

To fche extent that Congress required the

states to pay unemployment compensation to an unemployed
person who refused to cross a picket line* they did then
insert themselves in a certain extent into the -- Or perhaps
a better way to put it is, they required the states to insert
themselves into the economic warfare,
MRd, MARCUd ;

Yes.

They certainly were thinking

along the lines that the President's Committee asked them to
think along.

What they said was, "We will put this restric­

tion on fche states, but we will not put down the flat re­
striction that the President's Committee asked us to do.
We will do this.

We will put in this that has to do with

labor-management controversies, but we won't go as far as
we were asked to do and flatly prevent the state from develop
ing its own program."
QU.ddTIUN;

They moved the other way from the recom­

mendation of the President's Committee, but they moved only
slightly.
MRd . MARCUd :

Yes, that is correct.

27

So, we’ve got the Social Security Act* which I thinks
in itself* provides a basis for the rejection of the preemption
claim here.

But, in addition, there are other and independent

grounds for dismissal of these claims.
How, Petitioners have said that a uniform national
standard on the payment of unemployment benefits, during In­
dustrial controversies, is essential to the Federal labor
scheme.
Congress thinks otherwise, and its viexvs, rather
than economic theory, which are controlling.

Congress* view

has come out in a variety of different statutes.

How, we have

noted that the NLRA and the Social Security Act were passed at
the same time by the same Congress sitting in the same session.
In 19^7# there was an attempt to amend the National Labor
Relations Act.

In fact, the House passed amendments, which

said that any employee who received unemployment compensation
while he was on strike would be deprived of his protection and
status as an employee, under the NLRA.

The House Minority

report, in commenting on that, interestingly enough, pointed
to the Social Security Act as the core of Congress1 intent on
the question, and said, "Under the Social Security Act, this
matter has advisedly been left to the states."
criticism of the House amendments.

That was their

The Senate refused to go

along with those amendments and they were dropped.
Then, in the Railroad Insurance Act, you have a

28

situation which has lasted for more than forty years where
there is a requirement of paying unmploymenfc benefits to
striking railway workers»

There have been a number of amend­

ments of that original scheme, amendments to raise the benefit
levels and increase the duration of paying benefits.

But from

its inception it has been an all employer-financed scheme.
QUESTION:

But the labor disputes under that are

governed by the Railway Labor Act.
MRS . MARCUb:

Yes, they are.

While there are some

differences in structure, this Court pointed out in Locemotive
Engineers v. Baltimore and Ohio that those differences go to
the beginning of the labor dispute, vfhere there are various
mediation provisions which must be followed.

But that once

those initial stages are over, the parties are in the same
position as they are under the NERA, self-help and collective
bargaining.

So, there are obviously similar features in both

laws.
QUESTION:

One of them that you have just pointed

out that is quite different is that Congress requires the
payment of unemployment benefits to striking railroad workers,
whereas It doesn't to striking workers in other areas.
MRS, MARCUb:

It does not require then, Your Honor,

but it permits them, under the plan —
QUESTION:

Well, that's the issue in this case.

MRb» MARCUb:

Yes, it is.

Under the plan of the

29

Social Security Act* I think it has to be kept in mind what
that plan was.

The plan was to give permission to the states

which were plenary and general* and to spell out only those
few areas in which the states were restricted.
4

law is set up.

That's how the

>.

It wasn't set up with a million, "You may do

this and this and this*" but rather because of the need to
bring the states into the field* the urgent Federal-State
cooperation that was absolutely essential to the success of
the Social Security Act* the plan was to make clear to the
states that they had this broad latitude* that there would be
no dictation from Washington* and that they would be restricted
in only a few particulars* all of which were set out in the Act.
That was how the Act was structured.
Then* when Congress considered the question of food
stamps and whether they should be granted to strikers* Congress
had another opportunity to look at the relation of the payment
of public benefits and the economics of labor disputes.

And

what they said there was that food stamps must be paid to
strikers and the reason that they gave was that to deny bene­
fits would be to take sides in labor disputes.
So* obviously* the idea of neutrality which
Petitioners are trying to present here is quite different
from Congress' idea of neutrality.
In AFbCU* uniform definitions were established by
Congress* but the HfiW Secretary* under a regulation upheld by

30

this Court* did preserve local options to the states* who
could take their choice as to whether to grant benefits or to
refuse to do so.
A contemporary congressional expression about the
Social Security Act .also occurred when the Nixon Administration
in the 91st Congress era asked that the Congress supply the
bar against striker benefits which the Petitioners are now
asking from the Judiciary.

They said* "Don't let the states

pay unemployment benefits to strikers."

Congress refused to

go along with that recommendation and Representative Mills*
who was Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee* said in
floor debate, "Well, for example, there are states that pay
unemployment benefits to strikers.

I wouldn't vote for it,

but if they want to do it, why shouldn't they have the lati­
tude to write the program they want."
QUESTION:

How many states do pay benefits?

I

know it is in your brief, but I haven't seen that for a long
time.
MIS o MARCUS :

The vast majority of states, Your

Honor, do pay under a variety of different schemes.

Some,

for example, pay if the employer continues in operation during
the strike.

Scans pay if there is a strike protesting against

hazardous conditions.

Some pay if the employer violates his
Some pay if the employer violates Federal

Some pay If the employer violates State Labor law.

31

QUESTION:

How many pay* just indiscriminantly*

to any economic strike?
MRS . MARCUS:

I don’t know that

Either they have

the provision that we have* which provides a suspension period,
which eliminates the vast bulk of strikes from consideration
altogether* or they fix on particular circumstances*, under
which the benefits should be paid.
QUESTION:

My question was how many do not fix on

particular circumstances?
MRS. MARCUS:

In other words* how many are like

New York’s law and have the suspension period?
Rhode Island and possibly the Virgin Islands.

But

Rhode Island has our suspension period approach, which
eliminates the vast majority of strikes.
QUESTION:

Hawaii had that if the employer stays

in business with 80$ of his -MRS. MARCUS:

Correct.

Hawaii has the same kind

of statute as this Court upheld in the Kimball case* that is.
If the employer continues in substantial operation* then the
benefits will be paid.
QUESTION:

But only New York and Rhose Island and

possibly the Virgin Islands?
MRS . MARCUS :
QUESTION:

Have this particular approach,

That is* pay out in any economic strike

at least after a waiting period.

32

MRj . MARCUS:

Yes, but pay nothing,no matter what

the circumstances, during the suspension period, which elimin­
ates most strikes from any payment altogether»

'Whereas, the

other schemes, by and large, pay at the outset of the strike
after a normal waiting period, if the circumstances are what
the statute includes.
QUESTION:

Your position here would be the same

whether there were a waiting period or not, would it not?
MRS. MAB2US:

Our position is that what Congress did

In the Social Security Act was to give plenary and general
permission to the states to develop whatever kind of program
they wished, and what was set out in the Social Security Act
were the restrictions and not the permissions.
QUESTION:

I think your brief retreats from the

rational conclusion of that position, I.e., if a state decided
to pay double wages to strikers, you would have a hard time.
MRS. MARCUS:

Well, I think, Your Honor, that the

Congress certainly didn't prohibit any of the possible options,
but it would be unfeasible and unpolitical to have anything like
that happen.

I think if it did, of course, Congress would move

in, as it has left itself room to do, by a provision in the
Social Security Act which says no vested rights —
QUESTION:

There would be no preemption of that.

If

a state decided economic strikers are going to be paid double
what they would get by working.

You think there would be no

33
preemption problem there?
MIS. MARCUS:

Congress did not prohibit whatever

option the states adopt.

However* I think that the wisdom of

Congress in supposing that the states would act reasonably
— because the example that Your Honor gives is very un­
reasonable and a bad policy -- but —
QUESTION:

It is given in your brief* If I am not

mistaken* isn't it?

Some amicus brief* perhaps.

MP&o MARCUS:

No* not that example.

I think that the confidence that Congress had that*
obviously* the states would not do something unreasonable has
been justified by the fact that in 4o years -~
QUESTION:

Sometimes that is quite a violent

assumption.
MRS. MARCUS:
that has ever occurred.

— in 50 different states nothing like
No state has ever pass-id any such

unreasonble law* and we have had 50 jurisdictions to experi­
ment in and more than 40 years for that to have happened.

I

think the states have justified Congress' confidence in not
having —
QUESTION:

I think your opponents think that New

York and Rhode Island have an unreasonable law.
MRS. MARCUS:

Yes* but the example that Mr. Justice

Stewart has cited is very far from anything that hag, occurred
or I think would occur.

34
It is clear from the examples of all these different
statutes that a uniform policy on the payment of unemployment
benefits to strikers is not essential to the Federal regulatory
scheme* and that Congress has repeatedly said so and indicated
so,

I want to point out that we are looking*in presenting this

legislative history to this Court* at the same kind of docu­
ments* the same kind of amendments* refusals to amend* specific
legislative reports* floor debate — the exact same kind of
documents that this Court considered In Hotery,
QUESTION:

But* Mrs, Marcus* I don't think your

opponent really says that there needs to be a uniform policy,.
I think what they are saying is anything is all right* so long
as it doesn't interfere with the overriding policy of neutral­
ity*
MRj, MARCUS :

Well* my understanding of what

Petitioners are urging here is that the payment of unemployment
benefits during strikes* which includes all the different
r

options that all the different stated have adopted* can't be
i

done* and that* therefore* the uniform policy that they are
presupposing is that you don't pay any unemployment benefits
during strikes under any possible option or approach.
Now* that is a uniform policy and* in fact* th©
words are used a number of different times in the petition
and in Petitioners* brief that the Federal Government requires
a uniform national policy on the question.

And the policy ie =—

QUESTION:

In this precise area.

But your opponent

doesn't question at all the autonomy of the states to indulge
in all the variety they want to in other areas of unemployment
compensationo
MRS. MARCUS :

No.

In the question of paying unemploy

ment benefits to strikers, no matter what the option is, no
matter what the version, no matter what the money, no matter
what the circumstances, no pay under any circumstances.

And

they have repeatedly used the phrase —QUESTION:

I am not sure that's a fair statement of

They rely very heavily on the trial court

findings that here there is an actual impact on the bargaining
positions of the respective parties.

It seems to me that

consistently with that view they admit, for example,, welfare
payments are all right, that there could be lesser amounts
of money, something much less than $49 million that would not
tip the scales.

I don't think their argument goes — Is sort

of an automatic rule.
MRS . MARCUS:

Well, they have repeatedly used the

phrase that a uniform national policy is essential.
QUESTION:

To the extent of neutrality.

MRS a MARCUS:

To the extent that you can't pay un­

employment benefits during strikes.

And that's what the

vast majority of states do.
MRS * MARCUS:

If they concede welfare benefits are

ment benefits of no greater amount * or something like that*

may legislate.

And that intention is

clear from the legislative history* not only of the Social
Security Act* but all the other statutes in which Congress has
load the opportunity to consider this question.
QUESTION:

Is what you are saying that the Court of

Appeals said* basically* assuming for the sake of argument
that the District Court's findings are correct and* therefore*
we will not review them on a clearly erroneous basis* we none­
theless find -,

MRSo MARCUS:

They were not interested in the facts*

and properly so* because the question of preemption is not one
of economic theory.
QUESTION:

It is one of congressional intent.
It can be one of economic fact* though*

can't it?
MRS. MARCUS:

But here the question is:

Did Congress

that we say that the Social Security Act and these other
statutes demonstrate?

And if that is so* then* the states

have the right to choose whatever options they wish.

So it is clear

that —
QUESTION:
one step further?

May I take Justice Marshall's question
In the brief the Government has filed, they

give you the hypothetical example of requiring 100$ of the
wages during the period of the strike, and they seem to say
that would be preemptive — the statute that provided that.
Would you agree with that concession by the United States?
MRSo MARCUS:

No, I really wouldn't because I think,

as I said, the Social Security Act did give a plenary and'
general permission.

However, that would be unfeasible and

politically — It is a thing that couldn't happen, but it is
a thing that Congress would have to move in then to prevent
as it can and frequently does.

But, as I said before, the

confidence that Congress visited in us has not been abused by
that sort of provision.
In conclusion, I would like to say that at stake in
this case is the state's right to determine what is in the
best interest of New York citizens.

And Congress has given

New York that right, given it that right, knowing exactly what
New York's law said

^fc.fche time that it passed both statutes

that we are speaking of.

And it is rare that you have so many

different indications of congressional intent all pointing in
the same direction

40

Petitioners proffer in response only a general pre­
emption principle derived from the overall plan of the NLRA,
which has never been held to be absolute.

And for this reason

we urge the affimance of the unanimous decision of the Second
Circuit.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* Mrs. Marcus.

Thank you* Mr. Benefcar.
