MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Chalmers, you may

proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LESTER V. CHALMERS, JR.,
ON BEHAI,F OF THE PETITIONER NORTH CAROLINA
MR. CHALMERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Respondent, Willie Thomas Butler, was apprehended
and arrested by Special Agent David C. Martinez and other
agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on the third
day of May, 1977, in an apartment located in New York City,
upon an unlawful flight warrant to avoid prosecution.
Agent Martinez read to the Respondent the card which
reads as follows:

“Before we ask you any questions, you must

understand your rights.

You have the right to remain silent.

Anything you say can be used against you.

You have the right

to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions
and to have him with you during questioning.

If you cannot

afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any
questions if you wish.

If you decide to answer questions now

without a lawyer present, you will still have a right to stop
ansxfering and at anytime until you talk to a lawyer."
The Petitioner asserts that the Federal agent fully
complied with the prophylactic rules as announced by Miranda,
and the current policy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

r

regarding the waiver of rights and the use of Form FD 395, as
appears on pages 13 and 14 of the Brief of the Solicitor
General,
The Respondent was not questioned at this time about any
events that occurred in North Carolina.

He was transported by

the agents to their New Rochelle Office, about six miles away.
He was taken to an interview room at the FBI Office in New
Rochelle, and then handed the Advice of Rights form FD 395, and
subsequently asked whether he read the form, and he nodded his
head and said he had.
He was asked if he understood it and he replied he did.
He was then asked to sign the form and replied that he
didn't want to sign the form and stated, "I will talk to you,
but I am not signing any form."
Agent Martinss further testified that h© did not
threaten the Respondent, and he did not offer him any hope of
reward or inducement to get the Respondent to talk to him.

And

lie did not use any misrepresentation, trickery, force or
coercion to get the Respondent to talk to him.

That the

Respondent was in possession of his facilities.

He did not appear

to be under the influence of alcohol or narcotic drugs.

That

the Respondent told him he had an Eleventh Grade education and
that the Respondent appeared to know what was going on about him
and appeared to respond to questions in sequential fashion.
Agent Martinez further testified that the Respondent

4

told him he would speak to him without a lawyer.

That the

Respondent never told him that he did not want a lawyer

$

present, nor did Respondent tell him that he did want a lawyer
present.

That he again informed the Respondent that he could

have a lawyer and that one would be appointed for him if he
so desired.

And that he asked the Respondent the following

questions:
Will you speak to us knowing full well that you have
these rights?
And the Respondent replied, "I won't sign the form.

I

will talk to you, but I won't sign the form"
Martinet further testified that it was his impression
that the Respondent did understand his rights, and did not
necessarily want a lawyer? but that he would refuse to sign any
type of paper.
The trial Court concluded that any statements made by
Respondent to Special Agent Martinez were made freely and
voluntarily? that the Respondent had been advised of his
Miranda rights, including his right to an attorney, and that
the Respondent understood these rights, and that he effectively
waived these rights, including the right to have an attorney
present during the questioning by his indication that he was
willing to answer questions.

And that the statement made by

the Respondent was made at a time when the Respondent understood;
his rights, and that no promise or offer of leniency nor

5
threats nor pressure nor coercion of any type had been exerted
against him.

The Respondent — and that any statement or

confession so made was freely and voluntarily given.
The trial Court then admitted into evidence the
culpatory statements made by Respondent to Special Agent
Martinez.
The Supreme Court of Worth Carolina reversed the trial
Court and held that the evidence on voir dire was insufficient
to support the findings that the Respondent waived his rights
to counsel by written waiver or a specific oral waiver knowingly
made.
It is noted and called to the Court’s attention that
this interview was conducted by a trained agent of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation# and that he rigidly followed the
current FBI procedures as they appear in the Brief of the
Solicitor General.

And it is further noted that Chief Justice

Warren at pages 483 and 484 commended to all law enforcement
agencies the practice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
as they existed at that time with respect to interviewing
suspects.
Mr. Ghief Justice Warren stated that the practice of
the FBI can readily be emulated by State and local enforcement
agencies.

And in a footnote on page 55

footnote 55# page

485, Mr. Chief Justice Warren stated# MWe agree that the
interviewing agent must exercise his judgment in determining

6

whether the individual waives his right to counsel.

Because

of the Constitutional basis of the right, however, the standard
for waiver is necessarily high and, of course, the ultimate
responsibility for resolving this Constitutional question lies
with the courts.
The Petitioner does not challenge the continuing
validity of the Miranda Decision nor any of the guidelines it
established to protect what the Court said in Miranda was a
person9s Constitutional privilege against compulsory selfincrimination.
The issue in this case is as follows;

Interpreting

this Court's decision in Miranda, in the absence of an oral
or express written waiver of right to counsel prior to
questioning.

Does Miranda allow a finding of implied waiver

of right to counsel from the totality of the surrounding
facts and circumstances of the case where the suspect has been
fully advised of his constitutional rights before making
voluntary incriminating statements in response to this
question ~ to questions.
Resolution o£ this question turns almost entirely
on the interpretation of three passages in Miranda, in the
Miranda Opinion, which the North Carolina Supreme Court
relied on in finding a per sa violation of Miranda.
It is the position of Petitioner that the interpre­
tation of the three passages relied on by the Supreme Court

7

of North Carolina, at page 470, 475 and 479 of Miranda should
not lead to absurd or unintended results and transform

the

Miranda safeguards into wholly irrational objects -- obstacles
to legitimate police investigative activity, and deprive
suspects of an opportunity to make an informed and intelligent
/

assessment of their interests.
QUESTIONS

Do you feel the North Carolina rule is

rather isolated?
MR. CHALMERS:
QUESTION?

I"m sorry?

Do you feel the rule enunciated by your

Court is rather isolated among other Courts?
MR. CHALMERSz
QUESTION s

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I do.

Why do you think your Court takes that

position?
MR. CHALMERSt

I can only say, sir, that in the four

or five cases that our Court has had this question raised to,
they have strictly interpreted Miranda.

And to

answer your

first question, sir, it is my recollection that every Circuit
Court in the United States, including the District of Columbia,
and 20 of cur sister States interpret Miranda opposite from
our North Carolina Supreme Court.
QUESTION:
Miranda back here?

Do you think they’re throwing the ball of
Is that v/hafc they’re doing?

MR. CHALMERSs

Mr. Justice Blackmun, yes, sir.

What do these passages mean as interpreted by our

8

North Carolina Supreme Court?
The Petitioner asserts that they do not mean, that an
informed waiver of right may he ineffective, even when
voluntarily mads.
As Mr. Justice White said in his concurring Opinion
in Michigan v. Mosley, ”"nless an individual is incompetent,
we have in the past rejected any paternalistic rule protecting
the Defendant from his intelligent and voluntary decision
about his own criminal case.

To do so would imprison a man

in his privileges and to disregard the respect for the
individual which is the life blood of the law.”
The Petitioner asserts that these words do not pro­
hibit every element which influences a criminal suspect to
make incriminating admissions.
As Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated, in United States v.
Washington, the Fifth Amendment does not preclude a witness
from testifying voluntarily in matters which may incriminate
him for those competent and free-willed to do so may give
evidence against the whole world, themselves included.

Indeed,

far from prohibiting by the Constitution admissions of guilt
by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desired.

In

addition to guaranteeing the right to remain silent unless
immunity is granted, the Fifth Amendment proscribes only self™
incrimination obtained by a genuine compulsion testimony,
accordingly, unless the record reveals some compulsion,

9

Respondents incriminating testimony cannot conflict with
any Constitutional guarantees of the privilege.
Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated at page 188, "The test
is whether considering the totality of the circumstance the
free will of a witness was overborne."
QUESTIONs

Well, that’s not the test of Miranda.

MR. CHALMERS:
QUESTION;

Sir?

The test under Miranda is not whether the

free will of a witness was overborne but, rather, whether the
Miranda warnings were given, and that's it.
MR. CHALMERS;
QUESTION;

That is the position?

Miranda is not a voluntariness test.

MR. CHALMERS;

No, sir.

That is the position of the

State of North Carolina, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION;

Well, isn’t that what Miranda says?

MR. CHALMERS:
QUESTION;

That’s what Miranda says.

What this Court has done in every case

that has followed Miranda.
MR. CHALMERS:

That’s correct, sir, and may I state,

sir, there is Michigan v. Mqaley.

You, sir, stated that a

practical prohibition against the taking of voluntary state­
ments are affirmative immunity from further interrogation
regardless of the circumstances would transform the Miranda
safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate
police investigative activity and deprive suspects of an

10

opportunity to make an informed and intelligent assessment
of their interests.
We say, sir, that our Court has, by its position,
taken these words to mean that the suspect is deprived of an
opportunity to make an informed and intelligent assessment of
his interests, and to take whatever action he voluntarily
chooses.
QUESTIONs

I think that the Respondent will take the

position that the Respondent doesn't mind appraising his own
position quietly and to himself, but not before public — and
without help from the prosecution.
Why put all the weight on that he wants to sit down
and appraise something -— the Respondent?
MR. CHALMERS:
QUESTION:

You keep saying that.

I think—

He's under detention in the FBI Headquarters

and he thinks out loud? is that your position?
MR. CHALMERS:
QUESTION:

I misunderstood you.

MR. CHALMERS:
QUESTIONS

Ho, sir,

Ho, sir, Mr. Justice Marshall.

I thought that was what you were saying.

MR. CHALMERS:

No, sir.

A further position of the State of North Carolina,
the Petitioner, that these words were not intended to create
a Constitutional straight-jacket, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist

stated in Michigan against--

11
QUESTIONS

fir. Chalmers * I did understand you to be

arguing that the rule that the North Carolina Supreme Court
followed deprives the suspect of the opportunity to act
intelligently in his own way.
MR. CHALMERS:

Aren't you arguing that?

No, sir.

No, sir, I'm saying this,

Mr. Justice Stevens, that our Court, by its interpretation of
Miranda has placed on the law enforcement agents and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation within the confines of North Carolina
an express written or oral waiver before ciny statement can be
admitted, disregarding entirely any circumstances, any gesture,
any words the Defendant uses to give to the trial judge at
the trial level sufficient facts to find out exactly»-2
QUESTION:

Doesn't the rule that the North Carolina

Court follows have the advantage of a little more certainty
than the finder of fact trying to interpret ambiguous context?
MR. CHALMERS:

No, sir.

I think, on the other hand,

and I'll get to it in just a moment, Mr. Justice Stevens, I
think what our North Carolina Court by its rule has done is to,
in effect, add another sentence to the litany of the Miranda
warning wherein our Court now, by its interpretation of
Miranda, would now require this Court to add the litanh ,
"Since you declined to execute a written waiver of your rights,
do you now expressly orally waive these rights?"
*

QUESTION:

And what would be wrong with that to be

darned sure about what he intends to do?

12
MR. CHALMERS:
QUESTION:

Would that solve the question?

Sure? if the answer is yes? the issue is

solved.
MR. CHALMERS:

All right? sir? and suppose? sir, the

Defendant at that time makes no statement? but continues on
talking?
QUESTION:

Well? suppose he talks before he gets the

Miranda warnings at all?

It's the same problem.

I suppose one

of the interests that the law enforcement people have here is
to have a claarcut rule where everybody knows when the
questioning can commence.
MR. CHALMERS:
QUESTION:

Yes? sir.

And you know you can't commence at least

until you read him the form.
MR. CHALMERS %
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And the question is can you commence before

he answers unequivocally, “I'm prepared to talk”.
MR. CHALMERS:
QUESTION:

Well? we say—

You say yes? well? if vie just kind of leave

it a little ambiguous? we'll take our chances on what the
trial judge will find.

If you require him unequivocally

how he feels? don't you remove one issue from the trials that
follow?
MR. CHALMERS:

Yes? sir? except you are adding to the

litany of Miranda and making-"*

13
QUESTION;

For the very reason that you have the

Miranda warning,, you want to be very sure that the man is pre­
pared to confess voluntarily without counsel.
MR. CHALMERS;

That's correct.

We have no problem

whatsoever with the fact that a prisoner or a suspect should be
fully informed and should—
QUESTION;

Shouldn't there be a question in your mind

when he says, "No, I won't sign a form?"
MR. CHALMERS;

No, sir, there's no question in my mind

about that.
QUESTION;

Supposing your guilty plea cases where you

have a set of things that the trial judge has to read to the
person who is pleading guilty as to what he is giving up, there
has really been nothing yet devised that makes a foolproof
situation where the Defendant can't come in and say, "Well, I
was under the"—

"I did say yes, I understood it all.

I did

sign it, but 1 was under the influence of drugs at the time and,
therefore, I want a new hearing on it."
MR. CHALMERS:

No, sir, and we face that, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, in North Carolina with respect to post conviction
hearings and also habeas corpus hearings, where the long line
.1

of questions asked of a Defendant are repudiated at a later
date and denied.

And I don't think that adding one other or

two other sentences to the long list that we have when a
Defendant enters a plea would preclude him from recanting or

14
denying that he voluntarily plead.
QUESTION :

No, but you really don’t have a problem if

he signs the form, do you?

Isn’t normal practice to try and

get them to sign the form?
MR. CHALMERS:

No, sir, I can’t say that it is.

We’re

dealing — in the facts in this case, we’re dealing with an
FBI agent, a highly trained, sophisticated law enforcement
agent.

And I can’t say-*QUESTION:

On the one side of the conversation a highly

sophisticated law enforcement agent, that’s right.
MR. CHALMERS:

Yes, the bast our country is able to

produce.
QUESTION:

And he was unable to get him to sign a form.

MR. CHALMERS:

No, sir, I don’t think there's anything

in this record that this FBI agent was unable to get him to
sign a form.
I
QUESTION:

He asked him to, didn't he?

MR. CHALMERS:

He handed him a form and asked him would

he sign it.
QUESTION'S

Yes.

MR. CHALMERS:

Yes, sir, but I don’t think — in fact,

I’m certain there’s nothing in the record or any allegation
by my friend Mr. Braswell representing the Respondent that
there was any pressure put on him, on the Respondent.

But

after he handed him the statement he said, "1 won’t sign it.”

15
Now to say the fact he won’t sign a statement determines
fully and completely the involuntariness or the inadmissibility
per se of anything he did further is to ignore reality.

All

of us are raised as children, '’Don't put your name on
anything."

Don't sign anything.

Respondent Butler did.

And this is exactly what

And, with your permission, sir, and

with permission of the Chief Justice, if I meiy, just a moment,
we have another case that's pending before this Court now, and
it is cited in our brief, where an FBI agent testified with
respect to incriminating statements made, again in North
Carolina.
The FBI agent in that case terminated the interview
as soon as the man 3aid he wanted to talk to his mouthpiece.

good.

Miranda is good.

Those guidelines are

We're not asking this Court so to expand them as to

read into something that this Court which we feel has not —- did
not say in Miranda.
I submit that these words do not mean that a suspect
is required to execute a written waiver or expressly waive

16

these rights guaranteed by Miranda»
Mr. Chief Justice Warren stated at page 475 of the
Opinion, "If the interrogation continues without the presence
of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests
on the Government to demonstrate that Defendant knowingly and
intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination
and his rights to retained or appointed counsel.

This Court

has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of
Constitutional rights and vie assert these standards as applied
to in custody interrogation."
The position of the State of North Carolina, and we
assert, that as Mr. Justice Rehnquist stated in Michigan v.
Tucker, the Court said, and I'm quoting, "The Court said in
Miranda that the Defendant, of course, could waive these
rights, but that any waiver must have been made voluntarily,
knowingly and intelligently."
We would ask this Court, and we recognise fully that
this Court is not bound by any interpretation of any Circuit
Court throughout the United States, but each one of tha
Circuits have interpreted Miranda as was done in United States v.
Montos, a Fifth Circuit case where cert was denied and the
opinion expressed there was an express statement that the
individual does not require a lawyer is not required.

However,

to show that an individual waives his right to have on© present
prosecution must show that he was effectively advised of his

17
rights and he effectively waived them.
QUESTION?

Mr. Chalmers, you repeated what you said

earlier that each one of the Federal Circuits has expressed
disagreement with North Carolina8s rule.
MR. CHALMERS;
QUESTION;

That9s correct.

At the time of your petition, I think it was

10 of the 11 Circuits.
MR. CHALMERS;

At the time of our petition, we could

not and did not find the Sixth Circuit.

We were relying on

the statement of the Solicitor General in his brief amicus
curiae that the Sixth Circuit had ruled that way.

That is my

reason for saying unanimity.
QUESTION;

I see.

And at the time of your petition

I think you said 16 States and now today you have told us 20
States.
MR. CHALMERS; I believe that in our petition, sir,
and in our brief we stated that there i^ere 20.
QUESTION;

Twenty.

MR. CHALMERS:
QUESTION;

Are they identified in your brief?

MR. CHALMERS;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, they are.

Mr. Chalmers, before the Miranda Case

was decided, how many States had adopted the rule of the
Miranda Case, do you remember?
MR. CHALMERS;

Before Miranda was announced by

Mr. Chief Justice Warren?
QUESTION;

Yes.

At the same time the Miranda Case was

ORAL ARGUMENT BY R. GENE BRASWELL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT WILLIE THOMAS BUTLER
aka TOP CAT
MR. BRASWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
At the outset, I would like to explain the facts, and
elaborate upon those a little differently than my brother did,
in stating that I think one must see that at the time of six
o’clock a.m., seven agents from the FBI arrived at the residence
of the Respondent.

He was awakened by a loud noise.

He was

gone in — the agents went inside and awakened him from his
sleep, took him out, advised him orally of his rights.
no statement.

He made

He was taken down to the New Rochelle office—

QUESTION:

What significance do you attach to the hour

of the day?

MR. BRASWELL:

Because I say that his understanding^,

intelligently and knowingly waived any rights he may have.

I

wanted to bring that to the Court's attention that within one
hour—
QUESTION:

That doesn't relate to six o'clock in the

morning as it might at two o'clock in the morning in fcnafc sense,
does it?

MR. BRASWELL;

Well, I think it does depending upon it

him aroused.

He took a lot of noise to get

Seven agents, they

were prepared to go to any extreme and indicated by Officer
Martinez that they took him down approximately 7;15 to the
New Rochelle Office.
read it.

They handed him a form and asked him to

Whereupon, I contend that the officer at that time

assumed that this man had the intelligence to understand and
he could read it simply from stating that he had an Eleventh
Grade education.
There is no guarantee that this man possessed the
intelligence to understand what he read at that time.
After he read that, he stated, t!I will not sign it. I
will not sign anything."

And at that time the officer pro­

ceeded to say, "It is not mandatory that you sign the form.

We

would like for you to talk to us.”
The Respondent contends that at that time the questioning
should have stopped unless when the officer made statements 7
"Well, it's not mandatory that you talk to us, but we would
like to ask you some questions".

The officer should have said

to him at that time, "But if you answer those questions, those
rights that are in that written paper that you just had in your
hand will still apply."

Because, as stated, I believe, that

the man at that time felt as he was there, as my brother said,
a paper, to me it attaches a different significance and that

21

the paper writing was something permanent.

That he was being

offered something to sign saying "I give up these rights."
He refused to do it.

He refused to take that step.

And I

believe our Court, the Supreme Court of North Carolina, is in
standing with what the Miranda Decision meant and what it
implies, that at that time, if in. any manner, a suspect in any
manner allows or intogates (phonetic) or makes a statement
to say that he at that time intends to exercise his rights,
there's a duty for the FBI man to stop and not go any further.
QUESTION;

Exercise what rights?

MR. BRASWELL:

To remain silent, not make any statement

or that he wants a counsel.

Or to that time he states, he

makes a statement, "I’m not going to sign anything.

I will

not sign the form", at that time Martines (phonetic) or
Martinez, whatever's the correct way to pronounce that, should
have stopped.
QUESTION;

Mr. Braswell, there wasn't any signed state­

ment involved in Miranda, was there?
MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

No, sir, there was not Justice Marshall.

Well, where do you put all this on the

signed statement and put it on Miranda?
MR. BRASWELL:
of the interrogation.

I think the interrogator set the tone
He orally advised the man of his rights,

and the man made no statement.

So he then come in and he

places a written statement before him and said, "Read this."
He at that time sets the tone for what he was going to do about

22

giving this man his rights .
If he intended to give his rights to him, I contend and
Respondent-- on behalf of Respondent that he should have read
them to him.

That he should have said — that he should not

assume could have read them and understood them.

He should

have gotten that specific waiver that Justice Stevens is
talking about.
QUESTION:

My point is why the emphasis on him not sign­

ing?
MR. BRASWELL:
Justice Marshall.

Because that’s what the officer gave him,
I feel at that time when ha gave him that,

he, at that time, placed himself, the agent that is, placed
himself in this man’s mind of saying, "Here is something that
you must sign if you want to waive your rights."

And the

man refused to 3ign it.
QUESTION:

Do you contend that he didn’t understand what

was printed, on the material handed to him?
MR. BRASWELL:

I say the record is silent on that, sir.

I’m saying that a court—
QUESTION:

The record doe3 show that he said he had an

Eleventh Grade education.
MR. BRASWELL:

He nodded his head, sir-

In our State

this year we gave an Eleventh Grade competency testwhere
approximately 25 percent of the people failed it which, I think,
shows that, you know, a person may be ashamed — he may be

23

reluctant to admit that he can't read and write.
QUESTION:

Normally there is a presumption that somebody

who has gone through eleven years of schooling knows how to
read and write.
MR. BRASWELL:

I grant you that* sir.

But I'm saying

in this particular case, this man here did not ever acknowledge
that he understood everything about it except, "I will not
sign it."
QUESTION:

Doesn't the record also indicate that he was

orally advised of his rights under the Miranda Case?
MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

Earlier and he exercised—■

Now there is no indication that he was

deaf, is there?
MR. BRASWELL:
time.

No, sir, and he exercised those at that

And he exercised them again with a written-QUESTION:

He exercised what?

MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

He exercised his right to remain silent.

No, he talked.

He expressed his willingness

to talk and he talked.
MR. BRASWELL:

He did not talk after the oral advice,

lie did not talk before offer of the paper,

lie said, "I will

not sign”, and he did not make any statement until the officer
said to him, "It is not mandatory that you sign the form, but
we would like for you to talk to us", which, as indicated here.

QUESTION;
sign it?

Isn’t that correct that he’s not required to

Isn’t that a correct statement of the law?

QUESTION;

Not in North Carolina.

QUESTION;

In Miranda, under Miranda, is there any

requirement?
MR. BRASWELL;
QUESTION;

North Carolina has held there is—

MR. BRASWELL;
QUESTION:
about.

No, sir, I say—

Sir?

—-in this case.

That's what this case is

North Carolina has now read Miranda to require an

explicit waiver.
MR. BRASWELL:

Express waiver, either orally or written,

not necessarily written, but one or the other.
QUESTION:

I think you're back to ray original question

which has nothing to do with what North Carolina thinks about
it.

13

there anything in Miranda, in the Opinion, directly

or indirectly, which says that a person must sign in writing
in order to waive?
MR. BRASWELL:

/
No, sir, there is not.

QUESTION;

That’s all ray question was about.

QUESTION:

Mr. Braswell, just so I have the sequence

correct, am I not correct in recalling that the oral advice
of Miranda rights was given in the Bronx before he was taken
to the FBI Office seven or eight miles away?
MR. BRASWELL:

That's correct

QUESTIONS

And then after he got to the -- and there was

no confession after the oral advice? but? after he got to the
FBI Office? he was handed the written thing to read to him­
self but there was no further oral statement of his rights
at that time»
MR, BRASVJELLs

No.

In the U. S. Brief filed an Amicus

Curiae by the Solicitor General?thhg

and I state that

it could happen, as I indicated earlier? we would not be
here.

They indicate that after the reading of the form by my

client that at that time the agent advised him that if he
didn't sign to talk? then you still have the same rights and
if you want an attorney? one will be appointed for you? if you
can't afford one.

If they ha.d said that? and he had went

ahead and made those statements $ I'd say there would be no
need for us to be here hearing this case.

But he did not say

that.
He said? "I'm not going to sign anything."

Again

Martinet said to him? "It is not mandatory that you sign? but
we would like to ask you some questions."
"Well? I'm not going to sign anything.

Whereupon, he said?

I'll talk to you."

And at that time Martinez? and I refer to the FD 395? the
FBI form which sits out the guidelines that one goes through
if one encounters this.
by the agent.

And I say that was not followed

There was nothing to indicate that h© wrote in

the form that the man refused to sign but said he would talk

26
to us.

There was nothing to indicate that ray client# the

Respondent# ever had an opportunity to read and to see and
v

have read back to him what allegedly he said# which I say
goes to one of; the tests that's being applied later on trust­
worthiness by Justice Rehnquist, which says, "If you look at
overall and the statement is trustworthy, you go to that.'QUESTIONS

But that wasn’t the basis on which the

Supreme Court of North Carolina excluded the test.
MR. BRASWELL:

No, sir.

They specifically — they said

there must be a specific waiver.
QUESTION;

And, Mr. Braswell, the Opinion of the Supreme

Court of North Carolina which decided this case in your favor,
seems to be inconsistent in its statement of the facts with
the answer you ga\'e to my brother Stevens.
It says, in the last paragraph on the page, on page
A-3 of the Appendix to the Petition, it says when he t^as
arrested

in New York, at 1225 Sheridan Avenue in Brooklyn,

"He was immediately and fully advised of his Constitutional
rights and transported to the New Rochelle Office where he
was again advised of his rights.

Defendant, who had an

Eleventh Grade education then took the Advice of Rights
^torm and read it to himself.
Now, you have said, in answer to Justice Stevens, that
all that was done at the New Rochelle Office was to give him
the Advice of Rights Form and he read it himself.
what this Opinion says.

That’s not

27
MR. BRASWELLs

That's right, I'm sorry I misunderstood.

He was arrested and then he was transported.
QUESTIONS
Miranda rights.

Yes, he was arrested and advised of his
He was then transported to New Rochelle and

again advised of his Miranda rights and then was given the
form to read; is that correct?

That's what the North Carolina

Supreme Court says.
MR. BRASWELLs

No, sir.

I agree that's what the case

says, but the statement of the case by the Petitioner and the
Appendix and the record itself says, in any case, that the
only thing that ever happened at that time was that he was
given the form to read.
QUESTIONS

Would you show me where in the Appendix?

QUESTIONS

actually.

It;es somewhat ambiguous,

"We advised him of his rights and I have a card

that I carry with me that I have here.

The card reads as

follows s"
MR. BRASWELLs

Okay, page A-5,

starting with the

first paragraph ’’During the trip”, "I gave him the Advice of
Rights form in the room”.
QUESTIONS

Well, there’s no question that he did give

him the Advice of Rights Form.
MR. BRASWELLs
QUESTION %

Yes, sir.

The question is did he orally advise him.

MR. BRASWELL;

All right, sir, I read, "During the

28

trip . . . hs was very quiet and he seemed to accept the
fact that we had arrested him and he offered no resistance.
He knew who we were and I think he knew what was going on.
At the office, Special Agent, Richard Berry and I took
Butler up to an interview room and gave him the Advice of
Rights Form which he read.
on him at that [sic] time.”

There were not any papers served
Skipping, "I gave him the Advice

of Rights form in the room and I observed whether or not he
could [sic] read it.

I read it and X don’t recall if X read

it orally to him."
QUESTION;

So the statement in the Opinion of the

North Carolina Supreme Court is erroneous?
MR. BRASWELL;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

This is ambiguous, “I don't recall if X read

it to him orally or not.”
QUESTION;
saying.

Mr. Braswell, let me be sure as to what you're!

Do you disagree with the statement that he was given

the Miranda ’warnings by Agent Martinez at the time of his
arrest and again back at the agent's office?
MR. BRASWELL;

I disagree that inasmuch as if it says

he was given them orally back in the New Rochelle Office.
QUESTION;

Because what X just read is from the

Petitioner's Brief and in your Brief you say that you rely
on the statement of the case as
Petitioner's Brief—

set forth in the

29

MR. BRASWELLs
QUESTION?

Yes , sir.

—with one exception, which is not relevant

to what I'm asking.
MR. BRASWELL:

Right.

In that there appears to be

again an oversight of the statement.
QUESTION:

I feel that the-”

Oversight on whose part?

MR. BRASWELLs

An oversight at the time that the Court

read that that we all took it from that, as Mr. Justice
Stewart did, at that time, sir.

But, in looking back through

the case and looking through the evidence and all find that
Officer Martinez was very -— could not be very exacting as
to reading the rights or whether or not—*
QUESTION:

Well, you didn't cross-petition for a review

of the Findings of Fact of the Supreme Court of North
Carolina, did you?
MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

I did not,

Is there any controversy about whether or not

your client was asked if he understood his rights after read­
ing the form and his reply that he did?
MR. BRASWELLs

Again, Mr. Justice Stewart, there appears

that he indicated by nodding his head and that he said he
did.
QUESTION:

And, again, I'm just reading from the Opinion

of the Court of Appeals in North Carolina.
MR. BRASWELLs

Yes, sir.

30

QUEST31 ON;

Which, as I say, was decided in your favor.

Are you questioning that statement of fact also?
MR. BRASWELL:

Not as this case relates, no, sir.

do question as it having in reality occurred.

I

But, based on

the narrow question as I see this, I did not question it,
no, sir.
QUESTION:

Does the question you think is here — is it

affected by whether or not he was advised orally at that
time?
MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

Why is that?

MR. BRASWELL:
anything.

I think it does, yes, sir.

Because he said, "X will not sign

I will not sign the form.81

At that time the agent

said, "It is not mandatory that you sign.

But we would like

to ask you some questions.M
QUESTION:

Would the situation be different if the

agent had orally advised him of his rights?
MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

I believe it would have, yes, sir.

Why is that?

MR. BRASWELL:

Well, on the occasion when he was earlier

advised of his rights, he made no statement.

If three or

four minutes occurred, a lapse of three or four minutes
occurred after the reading—
QUESTION:

1 know, but are you suggesting that he did

understand his rights from the paper?

I guess you assume that

31

he could read then.

And he understood his rights, but

he refused to sign?
MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

That's right.

So you think he was twice given his rights —

twice advised of his rights,once orally and once in writing?
MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And that he understood them both times?

MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

That is what he indicated, yes, sir.
Then you don’t disagree with that?

MR. BRASWELL:

Well, l*m saying that’s the agent’s

assumption of what he said.
QUESTION:

You don’t disagree that he was given his

rights?
MR. BRASWELL:

No, sir, I do not disagree that he was

orally given them and that he was writtenly given them at
the station.
QUESTION: Or that he understood them both times?
MR. BRASWELL:

I would disagree as to whether or not

there is sufficient evidence to show that he understood them,
yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Then how about, is there any controversy

over the fact that he said, "I will talk to you"?
MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

"I will talk to you", no, sir.

You accept that as one of the facts?

MR. BRASWELL:

I accept that he said that after the

32

agent made a statement to him, yes, sir. It is not mandatory—*
QUESTION?

And after at least one oral and one written

statement?
MR. BRASWELLS
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

He was advised of his rights.

MR. BRASWELLs

Yes, sir, that after the agent said,

"It is not mandatory for you to sign the form but we would
like for you to talk to us."
QUESTIONS

And he said, !,I will talk to you".

MR. BRASWELLs

He said, "I will talk to you but I

won't sign."
QUESTIONS

"I'm not signing any form”?

MR. BRASWELLs
QUESTIONS

Right.

You’re saying, in effect, that refusal to

sign repudiates any kind of consent?
MR. BRASWELLs
there.

I’m saying it should have stopped right

I think it should not have gone any further.

I think

that is closely akin to the, with the exception of time
limit there, of what Brewster states, where the man has gotten
on the train and is riding on the train and going to where his
other lawyer is.
QUESTIONS

Wouldn't you ba satisfied if the agent asked

him, "Do you waive your rights?"
MR. BRASWELLs
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

Would that satisfy you?

33

MR* BRASWELL;

If he hada said fco him and he hada got

a oral answer, "Yes* sir”, when he said, "Do you waive these
rights?"
QUESTION;

That would be all right?

MR. BRASWELLS
QUESTION;

Yes.

Well, probably, with, today8s education you

explained to us, he wouldn't know what the word "waive"
meant?
MR. BRASWELLs

That’s a very good point, Justice Stewart.

Quite candidly a lot of times when a person is on the stand anc,
you use a simply word "prior", he doesn’t understand what you
mean when you mean "before".
QUESTION;

It happens all the time.

This man or some other people?

MR. BRASWELL;

I can’t say for this man, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION;

Does the record show how old he was?

MR. BRASWELL;

I believe it does.

I understand, if I

recall correctly, 28, Justice Blackmun.
QUESTION;

When you say the FBI should have stopped,

I take it what you mean is they should have either given him
orally the rights or the substance of them again and had him
orally say, "I’ll waive"?
MR. BRASWELL;

Either stopped or they should have said

at that time, "We would like to talk to you, but it’s not
mandatory for you to sign this form, but if you talk to us the

34

same rights will apply."
QUESTION;

Is that your understanding of what the

North Carolina Court held?
sign in writing.

They didn’t hold that he had to

They held that he either had to make it

unequivocally clear orally or in writing.
MR. BRASWELL;
*

QUESTION;

That's correct.

There had to be an explicit waiver?

♦

MR. BRASWELL;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

--a waiver from circumstantial evidence.

MR. BRASWELL:

Do not leave it up to the officer to

assume, yes, sir.
/

QUESTION s

Anything further?

MR. BRASWELL:
QUESTION:

Thank you, gentlemen.

Do you have anything further, t£r„ Chalmers?

Very well, gentlemen, the case is submitted.
