MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 1163 and the consolidated cases,, Friedman
and others against Rogers and others»
Mr» Niemann, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY NIEMANN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TEXAS OPTOMETRIC ASSN», INC»
MR» NIEMANNs

Mr» Chief Justice,, and may it please

the Courts
This case involves the constitutionality of two
provisions of the Texas Optometry Act, one dealing ’with the
statutory requirements for Board membership, the other dealing
with statutory prohibitions of the practice of optometry tinder
an assumed name»
I, as attorney for the Texas Optometric Association,
will be presenting the facts relevant to the Board membership
statute, and arguing that that statute is constitutional»

Miss

Dorothy Prengler, who is an Assistant Attorney General of the
State, representing the Board, will be presenting the facts
concerning the assumed name statute? and she will be arguing
that that statute is also constitutional.
Now, if I may briefly present the: procedural posture
of this case»

The first statute, as I mentioned, which is in

issue is the Board membership statute»

It requires that four

of the six members of the Texas Optometry Board shall be

5

members of the Texas Optometric Association.

The second

statute is the assumed name statute. It provides that optometrists
in Texas shall practice optometry under their own personal name
and may not practice

optometry under assumed names or trade

names.
The lawsuit was originally filed by Dr. Rogers* who
is one of these six members of the State Board.

He challenged

the Board membership statute as an arbitrary classification in
violation of his equal, protection rights* his due process
rights and,, most recently, his association rights.
He also challenged the assumed name statute as a
violation of his rights of commercial free speech.

The lower

court* which was a three-judge court* held that the assumed
name statute was unconstitutional and was in violation of
commercial free speech *concluding that their decision was
mandated by this Court's opinion in Bates.
QUESTIONS

What do

the Texas statutes provide about

group practice of medicine and the general practice of
medicine? A similar prohibition?
MR. NIEMANNs

Your Honor* the Texas statutes are

silent regarding the group practice of medicine.

I would

point out that it’s very important that there has been no
history of abuse * and that is a distinction between the group
practice of medicine and the assumed name practice of optometry ;■
and I will expand on that later in my argument.

6

At the same time the Court held that the assumed
name statute was unconstitutional, the Court upheld the Board
membership statutes reasoning that it was an economic regula­
tion law that the rational relationship test applied and that
the State Legislature did have ample reason, ample justification for the statute, the Court listed three specific rationales
for the statute, the bottom line of each being that there was a
greater likelihood of law enforcement if four of the six
members of the Optometry Bear'd were from TOA.
Now for the facts which are specifically relevant to
the Board membership statute»
QUESTION;

I take it, Mr» Niemann, a commercial

optometrist may not join the TOA, or may he?
MR, NIEMANNs

That’s correct, Your Honor»

The unique history of optometry in Texas is what the
lower court pointed to as the justification for the Board
membership statute.

That history deals with commercial

optometry, historical track record of hostility toward enforce­
ment of the Texas Optometry law,
QUESTIONS

Counsel, Mr, Justice Blaekmun, as I

tinderstood it, asked you kind of an either/or question and
you said "That’s correct".

Can a commercial optometrist join

the TOA or can he not?
MR, NIEMANNs

He cannot.

It also deals not only with the track record of

7
non™law enforcement by the commercial optometrist, but also a
track record, prior to the passage of the Act, for disception
and consumer abuse.
Nov/, in understanding these facts, it is important
for the Court to appreciate that in Texas there are two separ­
ate classifications of optometristss
and commercial optometrists.
QUESTION;

professional optometrists

Traditionally —

In your view, could Texas prohibit

commercial optometry altogether, constitutionally?
MR. NIEMANN;

Yes, Your Honor, I think they could.

Traditionally, professional optometrists have been
characterized by an economic independence from opticians.
They have been characterized by their "practice by appointment”
rather than a "wait in line" method.

They have emphasized

quality and longer and more thorough examinations of the
patients, and a close doctor-patient relationship.

But,

most importantly, professional optometrists have been character­
ized by a long history of strong law enforcement of the Texas
Optometry laws.
And, as I indicated earlier, proatefisional optometrists,
or, rather, the Texas Optomatric Association is composed
exclusively of professional optometrists.
QUESTIONs

Well, that’s kind of circular, isn’t it?

They have been interested in enforcing the law because the law
benefits them.

And probably the law was enacted under their

8
support®
MR® NIEMANNs The law was enacted by the Legislature®
QUESTIONS

Yes®

MR® NIEMANNs

We happen to agree with the Legis­

lature, and we hold a philosophy of strongly enforcing the
mandates of the Legislature, Your Honor®
QUESTIONS

Because it's to your benefit®

MR® NIEMANNs

That’s right®

There's no doubt about

that®
In contrast are the commercial optometrists®

Now,

the commercial optometrists have been characterized by high
volume, high speed, assumed name practices®

Traditionally

they have been employed with or associated with the retail
optician chain stores.

They have been subject to highly

restrictive employment contracts, economic tie-ins —
QUESTIONj

Is there a difference in prices charged

by the two groups?
MR® NIEMANNs
over that, Your Honor®
are lower prices®

There is some dispute in the record
Dr® Rogers has witnesses to say there

We have a former commercialist himself,

the owner of a chain, that stated that the chain store opera­
tions, actually, under some circumstances, cause an increase
in prices®

And there is a California study, that I think is

in the record, that discounts the long-standing argument that
a commercial advertising assumed-name type practice actually

9
reduces prices„
As I was saying# the commercial optometrists are
characterized historically by these economic tie-ins and
control by opticians0

Most importantly# commercial optometrists

have been characterized in Texas by a repeated history of
hostility toward the enforcement of the Texas Optometry laws
on the books ,
Now# in the record# the most blatant episode of
optometry# commercial optometry's hostility toward law
enforcement# is an incident which occurred in 1967# the year
immediately preceding the Legislature's adoption of the Board
membership statute,,

During that year# the commercial

optometrists held a majority of the board,,

They immediately

proceeded to repeal a rule called the "professional responsibil­
ity rule",
visions,

Now# that rule contains some very important pro­
It prevented fee-splitting between optometrists

and opticians.

It prevented tie-ins and kickbacks.

It

minimized the economic control by opticians over optometrists.
It required optometrists to use their own personal name# and
prevented them from using assumed names or names at offices
where they did not actually practice.
That professional responsibility rule was the corner­
stone of the public's protection against deception and abuse in
optometry.

And it had been adopted as a rule by the Board

to correct and cure sort® long-standing abuses by commercial

10

optometry <>
Now, as soon as the commercial is ts on the Board
attempted to repeal this rule, the Legislature reacted very
strongly» The Legislature refused to confirm the appointment
of the commercialism

that had done the damage, the Legisla­

ture abolished the old Board, created a new Board, and man­
dated that four of the six members be from TOA»
And the Legislature went even further»
drew all rule-making authority from the Board»

They with­
They incorporated

the professional responsibility rule into the statute, and
assigned the task of enforcing the statute to the Board.
In effect, what the Legislature did was to codify
into statutory form very high standards of professional conduct,
standards which coincided with those of TOA»

And the Legis­

lature did not want to put enforcement of these very high
standards in the hands of the commercial optometrists who were
the mortal enemies of those standards.
In other words, Your Honor, the Legislature didn't
want to put the fox in charge of the hen house.
And that is the historical background of the Board
membership statute»

Miss Prengler will, as I've stated,

present the facts relevant to the assumed name statute»
Now to the legal arguments regarding the Board member­
ship statute»
I'd like to rebut in sequence each of the four separate

11
grounds of unconstitutionality presented by Dr»
These ares

Rogers,,

arbitrary classifications? irrebutable

presumption? procedural due process? and associaticnal rights»
Turning first to the arbitrary classification argu­
ment, Dr» Rogers has argued that the Board membership statute
is an arbitrary classification of optometrists which violates
his equal protection rights»
QUESTION?

Let me — perhaps you told us this, but

I want to get it clear in my mind» What's the total membership
of the Board?
MR» NIEMANNs
QUESTIONS

Six»

And their members serve' for hew long a

term?
MR» NIEMANNs

Four, I believe»

QUESTION: Staggered or —
MR» NIEMANN;
QUESTION:

Staggered»
And how do they become members?

MR» NIEMANNs

By appointment of the Governor, Your

Honor»
QUESTION:

Appointment of the Governor»

Total of

six, and the law requires that at least four have to —
MR» NIEMANNs

Well, let me add another step»

There is a gubernatorial appointment which must be confirmed
by the Senate, which meets every two years»

And thev serve

until they are either confirmed or unconfirmed by the Senate»

12

QUESTION?

Yes.

MR. NIEMANNs
QUESTION:

Now, regarding the arbitrary —
Mr. Niemann, on that point, supposing ~

is there any provision in the statute for what happens if a
member of TOA is appointed and confirmed and starts to serve
and then resigns from the Association?
MR. NIEMANN:

Under those circumstances, it would be

a vacancy and the Governor —
QUESTION:

No.

MR. NIEMANN:
QUESTION:
h®

Resigns from TOA, not from the Board,
Oh.

Is there an automatic vacancy or could

is the test his status at the time of appointment or must

he continue a member throughout his term?
MR. NIEMANN:
arisen.

Your Honor, the question has never

I would think the statutory construction of that law

would require his continuing membership in TOA.

But I don't

know.
QUESTION: Well, do you mean by that that he would be
removed?

He would be removed if he resigned?

He would forfeit

the office?
MR. NIEMANN:

Your Honor, I really don't know.

The statute requires that the Board consist of four
members of TOA, and I would think conclusively that it would
require their membership at the time of appointment? I v/ould
presume that it requires continuing membership, and resignation

13

or ouster from TOA would vacate his position»
How* regarding arbitrary classification* Dr» Rogers
argues that the statute is arbitrary because it has no rational
basis»

We disagree* and the lower court disagreed»
The lower court concluded conclusions very similar

to the facts I have just recited»

The court stated that the

three rationales were that TOA members are more likely to be
economically independent than non»TOA members! that TOA members
have a greater likelihood of emphasizing the highest quality
of eye care as compared to non-TOA members; and* thirdly*
that TOA members are more prone to enforce the Texas Optometry
Act than non-TOA members»
I believe it is a fair reading of the opinion that
these were findings of fact»
It is our position that the bottom line of all of
these three reasons is a greater likelihood of enforcement of
the optometry laws»
We do submit* then* that there are rational bases*
and therefore the arbitrary classification argument falls»
Dr» Rogers* next theory is that the Board membership
statute violates substantive due process because of an
irrebutable presumption»

He argues that the legislative

classification creates or triggers an irrebutable presumption
that a non-TOA member is unfit to serve on the Board»
And the lower court we believe correctly rejected

14
this argument, noting that an irrebutable presumption does not
exist in this case, since no commercial optometrist is con­
clusively denied xaembership on the Board»

Commercial optometry

is not prevented from sitting on the Board in those two spaces,
as is evidenced by the fact that Dr» Rogers,, himself a
comme2?cialist over 20 years, has been a continuing member of
the Board during that period of time»
Additionally, we would submit that there is another
reason why the irrebutable presumption analysis should not be
used»

We believe that the irrebutable presumption test

appears to demand legislative perfection, yet nearly all legis­
lative classifications on economic regulations contain some
degree of imperfection and inaccuracy»

Indeed, very few Acts

of the Legislature» could ever survive the bottom line requirement of the irrebutable presumption test, i„e0, that the
requirement that the legislative classification be an accurate
yardstick to implement the legislative goals 100 percent of
the time»
Dr» Rogers' next theory is that the Board membership
statute violates procedural due process»

The thrust of his

claim here is that the present and the future TOA Board
members will, as a matter of law, eilways be prejudiced against
commercial optometrists in all case; proceedings in all
situations
He argues that if the Board majority consists of

15

TOA members, the Board is unconstitutional per se, for all
purposes,including examinations, license renewal and discipline
ary actions»
We submit that if his argument were to be correct*,
the present Texas Board, consisting of four TOA members, would
be unconstitutional even if there never had been a Board
membership statute»

In other words, the constitutionality of

the Board would vary from year to year, depending on how many
TOA members were appointed to the Board by the Governor» And
we don't think that makes sense»
The lower court rejected this inherent bias
analysis and noted that bias must be proven on a case by case
basis»

It cannot be legally presumed as a matter of law, as

an inference from Association membership»
We submit that bias must be actually proved in the
context of specific parties in specific hearings that are
pending or which are about to commence»

In other words,

proof of bias in a hypothetical future adjudicatory hearing
simply does not allow the legal presumption of bias in all
conceivable future Board functions»
QUESTIONs

Mr» Niemann, isn't there perhaps some

inconsistency between that argument and your rejection of the
first argument your opponent makes, that your justification,
the reasoning for having majority is that there is in substance
a bias in favor of enforcement?

16

MR» NIEMANN’s

Apparently there — it might be

construed as an inconsistency, Your Honor{ but it is not»
The first argument is that the Legislature is justified in
concluding that TOA members would be more likely to enforce
the law.
The second argument here is that the judiciary cannot
presume, as a matter of law, that there will be prejudice
throughout the future»
One deals with the legislative right to declare a
reasonable classification, one deals with the prohibition
against the judicary assumption of prejudice in the future»
QUESTION?

So that the Legislature can agree that

a group of people are prejudiced, but the court can't?
MR» NIEMANN %

In the future, Your Honor, that's

correct»
QUESTIONS

Is it —

MR» NIEMANNs
QUESTION;

The Legislature can — I'm sorry»

Well, is it the judiciary deciding they

are prejudiced or the judiciary saying that "we accept the
presumption the Legislature adopts to justify its statute1*,
and given the presumption must the Legislature not out of —
I mean, must not the judiciary, out of deference to the
Legislature, say, "Yes, we'll accept the proposition these
people are biased»"
MR» NIEMANNs

Your Honor, bias toward law enforcement

17
is what the Legislature had in mind»

The bias being complained

about by Dr. Rogers is pecuniary bias* not bias regarding law
enforcement.

And those are two completely different animals.

I think the Legislature can presume that certain
persons, certain categories or classifications of persons will
be biased toward law enforcement and others may not.
Particularly — particularly, Your Honor, when there is a
track record of strong hostility, strong bias against law
enforcement, which has been exemplified by the track record
of commercial optometry in Texas.
Dr. Rogers* final theory is that his First Amendment
associational rights are infringed.

I would comment that the

issue was not raised below, and is being considered for the
first time by this Court on appeal.
The thrust of Dr. Rogers * argument here is that he
is being preluded from being on the majority of the Board if
he chooses not to associate with TOA.

It’s important to note

here that Dr. Rogers is not arguing that commercial optometry
is deprived of any representation on the Board, but only that
as a commercial optometrist he is deprived of being on the
voting majority of that Board.
QUESTIONS

It’s not a matter of his choosing not to

associate with TOA, he’s ineligible, isn't he?
MR. NIEMANN;

That’s correct, Your Honor.

another distinction which --

It’s

18
QUESTION?

So it’s not quite accurate to say that

if he chooses not to associate with the TOA, he's ineligible
to be on the majority,, he's ineligible to belong to the TOA
and therefore ineligible to be a member of the majority of the
boards isn’t that fair to say?
MRc NIEMANNs

That's correct. Your Honor0 That's

correcto
We submit that Dr0 Rogers' associational rights, if
any, are incidental and insignificant here.

Dr. Rogers’

complaint is that he is being deprived of being on the voting
majority of the Board, and it is our position that there is
no constitutional provision which guarantees the right of
anybody to be on the majority side of any vote, be it in a
political election, a legislative vote or an Optometry Board
vote.
QUESTIONS
sir.

Well, isn't there a rule — excuse me,

Isn’t there a general rule that you can’t be excluded?

As I understand it, there's no way for Dr. Rogers to win.
Is that right or not?

On the Board.

MR. NIEMANN §

I'm not quite sure that I understand

the question, Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

That when a vote is taken on the Board,

there's no way for Dr. Rogers to win.
MR. NIEMANN;
QUESTIONS

Your Honor, I might point cut that ~~

Well, is that true or not?

19

MR. NIEMANNs

If the vote deals with enforcing the

law, and the four members of the — the TOA members on the
Board vote to enforce the law, and Dr. Rogers votes against
enforcing the law, then there is no way he’s going to win.
QUESTIONS That was not my question.

My question was,

can you show any time that Dr. Rogers won the vote?
MR. NIEMANNs

Oh, there have been many occasions.

Your Honor, when Dr. Rogers has been on the majority.

I might

point out that the majority here is not a -QUESTIONS Well, I thought you said earlier that these
people just couldn't get along at all.
MR. NIEMANNs They don’t get along, but they still
agree on some things, Your Honor, in the way of license or
license renewal and enforcement of some of the laws, they have
common interests. Dr. Rogers feels very strongly about enforc­
ing some of the laws? but not all of the laws.
And so where they happen to agree on some of the laws,
then they will be voting together at that -QUESTIONS

Well, my point is, I don’t see any

difference between being a minority of two or one or being a
minority of 89.

If you're in the minority, you are, quote,

"in the minority”, end of quote, period.
MR. NIEMANNs
QUESTION s
MR. NIEMANNs

Your Honor, I might ask —
Am I right?
Yes, You. are.

But I would point out

20

that there is no constitutional right that a minority alx^ays
has the right to be in the majority. Consider for a. moment a
board of health consisting of various members from the
different professions and businesses:

a physician, an

optometrist, a dentist, a hospital administrator or a nursing
home administrator»

None of these — no one person on the

board would have his special»interest viewpoint represented
by the majority of the board»

But the fact that they are in a

minority, so to speak, from their special»interest viewpoint,
does not make that board unconstitutional»

If it were, we

would need to consider the unconstitutionality of thousands
of boards across the country,
QUESTION?

My only point is that you say he has all

the rights and everything, but he just gets outvoted,
MR» NIEMANN:

He gets outvoted, Your Honor, because

of his philosophy of non-enforcement and his opposition to the
anti»commercial optometry provisions of the Act»

These

reasons -»
QUESTION:

Is there any other case like this that you

know of?
MR» NIEMANN:

No, Your Honor, this is a case »»

QUESTION:

Where you take a dogfight and put it in

QUESTION:

No, there are no other federal cases, Your

Honor» There is a host of other cases, State court cases, in

which Board memberships have been tied to associational
qualifications»

States throughout the country»
QUESTIONS

But not federal»

MR» NIEMANN: But no federal cases, Your Honor»

For

those reasons»
QUESTION %

Mr» Niemann, —» oh, excuse me»

QUESTION:

Can Congress constitutionally require

that the Chairman of the EEOC be a member of the NAACP?
MR» NIEMANN:

No, Your Honor»

I think there is a

federal constitutional provision that impliedly prevents the
delegation of congressional powers to an association»
I would point out, however, that there is no
constitutional provision that prevents the State from delegating
such a power to private associations»
And that is a very distinctive difference»
For these reasons -QUESTION:
may»

Mr» Niemann, one other question, if I

The reason for favoring, for having four non-commercial

optometrists is the interest in enforcing of the prohibitions
against commercial optometry»

Other than the trade prohibition

against practicing the trade name, what are some of those
provisions that remain on the books and are constitutional?
MR» NIEMANNs

Your Honor, if I may summarize them by

referring back to my statement of facts, they are generally

22

reflected in the professional responsibility rule.

And that

rule prevents fee-splitting among optometrists, -QUESTIONS

Oh, I remember that? right»

MR» NIEMANNs

-*» it prevents the economic control,

the economic tie-ins, the kickbacks»
QUESTIONS

Are those statutory provisions or are they

ethical rules?
MR. NIEMANNs

Those are statutory provisions,

I

might refresh our memory, they were at one time a regulation,
adopted by the Board,

Then, when the commercialists got in

control, they were repealed, »—

Miss Prengler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS DOROTHY PRENGLER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF..OF E. RICHARD FRIEDMAN, ET AL.
MISS PRENGLER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I represent the State of Texas and the members of the
Texas Optometry Board.

I will address the issue of the

constitutionality of Section 5.13(d) of the Texas Optometry
Act, which provides that ,sNo optometrist shall practice under,

23

or use in connection with his practice of optometry, any trade
name, corporate name, assumed name, or any name other than
the name under which he is licensed to practice optometry in
Texas om
The court below held that this section is unconsti­
tutional under the First Amendment, and relied extensively on
the holding in Bates vs. State Bar of Arizona and Virginia
Pharmacy Board vsa Virginia Consumer Council.
Instead of properly analyzing the State's interest
and the First Amendment interest involved in this section, the
court deferred to the advertising cases as being determinative
of the outcome in this case, and thus struck down the statute.
If the balancing test in Bates and Virginia Pharmacy
is properly applied to this section, it becomes evident that
the statute validly promotes important State interest and
inflicts minimal restriction on First Amendment rights.
Before a discussion of the balancing test and the
State interest advanced by Section 5.13(d), I would like to
point out to the Court certain elements that are not in issue
in this case..

This is not an advertising case.

Optometrists

in Texas are free to advertise price, the availability of goods
and services, or even the quality of goods and services, as
long as it is not deceptive or misleading.
Therefore, the cons tuner is not denied the right to
receive information, as was true in Bates and Virginia Pharmacy,

24

They can also advertise in any media that they wish
to advertise in»

The prohibition against advertising prices

struck down by the court below, and we have not appealed that
issue»
We would also like to point out to the Court that
opticians, who merely dispense eyewear and are not licensed
in Texas, may freely operate and advertise under assumed names,
trade names or corporate names» The Texas Optometry Act fully
allows »"

business of selling frames and filling eyeglass prescriptions
is in no way impaired by this statute»
I would briefly like to give the Court some addi­
tional facts to show why the Legislature was reasonable in
enacting Section 5»13(d), the assumed name statute»
This particular section was passed two years after
the opinion of the Texas Supreme Court in Texas State_Board of
Examiners in Optometry vs» Carp»

The Court specifically

discussed some of the abuses and the evils that existed in
the practice of optometry

under an assumed name in Texas,

Thus, the Legislature, when they passed this statute, were
specifically aware of past abuses that had occurred in Texas
in the practice of optometry under a trade name, and had been
specifically found by the Texas Supreme Court to be misleading
to the public»

It was in response to those abuses that the

26

statute was passed»
And

\t@

contend that the Legislature had compelling

reasons to enact the statute in light of this particular case
and the abuses that were actually -QUESTION!

Miss Prengler, is there any explanation

or any reason for not barring the group practice of optometry?
Texas permits it* doesn’t it?

It’s just you can’t do it under

a trade name»
MISS PRENGLER!

That’s right»

You can practice

in association with other optometrists, but you have to
practice under the names of all the optometrists»

The statute

does allow optometrists to practice under a partnership name,
as long as the names of the partners, those partners actually
practice there at the office, the statute requires that they
have to at least practice at the office 50 percent of their
time»
QUESTION: So the statute just bars how you hold
yourself out to the public, just what kind of words you use
in representing yourself to the public?
MISS PRENGLERs

It requires that the individual

optometrist hold himself out in his own name»
QUESTION? But any other aspect of group practice is
not forbj dden?
MISS PRENGLER!
QUESTION:

No»

Well,

27

QUESTIONs

It's not too

different from a full-

disclosure requirement under the Securities Act or something
like that in that context, I suppose?
MISS PRENGLERs
That's correct.

That’s what we would contend,.

And it in fact requires that the optometrist

give more information to the public,
QUESTION?

And in billing, in any communications,

or in advertising, all of the names must be given?
MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTIONs

That's correct,

You can't send a bill out under just a

trade name?
MISS PRENGLERs
individual.

That's correct.

It's the

He must practice under that name, he cannot use

a trade name in connection with his practicet that's correct,
QUESTION;

Would you repeat —

QUESTION:

Miss Prengler, as I understand it, your

State does permit the practice under a partnership name so
long as the partners devote at least 50 percent of their
professional time to —*
MISS PRENGLERs

That's correct, yes.

There had

been an abuse in Texas where partnerships — where names of
owners of a practice were used on the door, and this was found
to ba deceptive since they were not actually there practicing,
QUESTIONS

So Smith & Jones, Optometrists, can

practice as such a partnership so long as Dr, Smith and Dr,

28

Jones devote at least half their time to the partnership work,
MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTIONs

Correct, Your Honor,

But, now, can they practice as Smith £

Jones, Optometrists, and also have as partners Brown, Black
and Green?
MISS PRENGLERs

Yes, they can,

That is correct,

QUESTION s Even though they are not mentioned in the
partnership name?
MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTION?

That's correct,

: But if they have a name like Cromwell

&

Sullivan, there must be a Cromwell and a Sullivan who spend
half their time?
MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTION!

That's correct, and the statute also —

And there might be a hundred others who

are not named? would that be so?
MISS PRENGLERs

That's right.

At one time optometrists in Texas were permitted to
practice under a trade name. Then in 1959 the Optometry Board,
as part of their rule^making powers at that time, adopted
the professional responsibility rule, which prohibited the
practice under a trade name.
The rule was then challenged by several optometrists,
including Dr, Rogers,

And it was in this context that the

case came before the Texas Court,
QUESTION! Well, do your cases explain, or is there

29

any reason for distinguishing between unincorporated groups
that use a trade name and partnerships that use just two names
of maybe a hundred partners?
MISS PRENGLER: The Court did not speak to that
particular issue»

However, the abuses were not present in a

situation where — they didn't find the abuses to exist? they
found the abuses to be directly associated to the use of a
name other than the partnership name»

And there were no

abuses that were documented that existed in the use of a
partnership name»
We would contend that, at least in a situation where
you have a partnership name, there is personal accountability
there in the name of the partner, and there is a partner whose
name is part of the practice, and it lends more accountability.
QUESTIONs

Now, could there be, under the Texas

law, two named partners doing business and spending 100 percent
of their time on the job, and they have as employees fifty
others who aren't partners?
MISS PKENGLERs

Yes.

Specifically, some of the abuses that were found
by the Texas Supreme Court were that the assumed name practice
disrupted the docfcor-patient relationship by concealing the
identity of the individual optometrist and bearing the
responsibility of a licensed optometrist in the trade name.
The Court cited situations where optometrists would

30

add, drop, or change their trade name at a particular location,
even though the licensed optometrist would remain the sameQ
The Court further cited instances of optometrists
being shifted from one location to another within the trade
name practice and not maintaining a stable practice in any one
particular location,.
The Court found -QUESTION?

But couldn’t that still happen if you

had a — I just wondered, if you had a Smith and Jones partnership with 45 other partners who were not named, and that
partnership operated offices all over the State,,
MISS PRENGLERs They could not operate offices all
over the State under the statute, because that particular name
could not be used all over the State unless they could somehow
spend fifty percent of their time therev of the time the
particular practice was open for business»
QUESTION s

That would mean only two branches , at

most? wouldn’t it?
MISS PRENGLERs Yes, Your Honor,,
QUESTION?

Fifty percent twice»

MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTION?

Right»

But two other partners of the 100-man

partnership could open the offices in some other place, and
be named partners, and all the other unnamed partners could
shift around, and all the employees could move in and out of

31
these various branches, X take it?
QUESTION s But each of the / named partners has to
spend at least fifty percent of his time of the partnership
business in an office.»
MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTION a

That’s correct,

Yes , but if a hundred •— if there are

a hundred partners, or fifty partners , two can be the named
partners in one place and two in another place.
QUESTIONS

Right, or not?

No, it doesn’t work,

MISS PRENGLERs

They could not be the named

partners, because under the statute it would be prohibited.
They could not spend the requisite amount of time.

You have

to have different optometrists at different locations, with
different names,
QUESTIONS

Right,

QUESTIONs

Oh, different named partners,

MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTIONS

Yes, that would be possible,

So, if I have it, if there are four

partners, two of the four can’ practice as a partnership in
Dallas by Smith and Jones, can use their name, and Brown and
Jackson can be the two named partners in Fort Worth,
MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTIONS

That’s true,

Yes.

MISS PRENGLERs

The Court further found that it was

common for one trade name owner to have different trade names,

32
practices under different names, within a small geographical
location» This gave the impression to the public that each
of the offices were independently owned and operated»

The

Court specifically found that the practice of optometry

under

a trade name was misleading and confusing to the public*, and
it was against this background that the Texas Legislature
enacted the prohibition in 1969»
Dr» Rogers urges that the assumed name statute is
unconstitutional as a violation of commercial free speech»
It is our contention that the assumed name statute does not
easily fit into the commercial free speech category»

It is

a concept that is admittedly difficult to characterize, but
we would contend that it should be properly characterized as
a regulation of conduct rather than speech.
The statute is designed to regulate the mode of
practice, and it is designed to cure the abuses that have
existed in Texas in relatively recent times»
The primary purpose of the statute is to insure
that optometrists do not obscure their license identity by
merging their identity with other licensed optometrists under
one trade name»
The assumed name statute is primarily directed
towards preserving the individual optometrist*s identity,
rather than regulating his speech»

If the assumed name

statute is viewed as a regulation of conduct, as we contend

33
that it should be* a rational basis teat is used to analyze
the statute* and* as the facts indicate* there is clearly a
rational basis for the statute.
However* if the assumed name is characterized primarily as a regulation of commercial free speech, the proper
test for analysis would be the balancing test as set out in
Bates.

Even under the balancing test* the assumed name

statute withstands constitutional muster.

In applying the

balancing test* various interests the State has in enacting
the statute are weighed against the conflicting First Amendment
interest to determine whether there have been significant
abridgements of those First Amendment interests.
In this case* any encroachment on the First Amendment
rights are minimal? and* on balance, we contend that the
interest promoted by the statute in protecting the health and
well-being of the citizens of Texas rises to an acceptable
reason for prohibiting the practice of optometry under a
trade name.
We first would consider the seller’s interest.

When

the seller’s interest in disseminating information is considered
under Section 5.13(d) * we contend that there is no significant
impairment.

A seller is allowed to get his message across to

the public through his own name and through any form of
advertising that he wishes.

Thes requirement that he practice

under his own name does not prevent him from using any media to

34
convey this message to the public, as long as the message is
not fraudulento
At the very most, this section imposes a minimal
restriction on the wording of a message0

It, in effect,

pro\d.des more meaningful information to the public by providing
the name of the individual practitioner,,
Dr® Rogers' real complaint is about the effectiveness
of a merchandising method and the value to him of using this
merchandising method to attract clients* not that any message
is suppressed,,

Dr« Rogers is not proposing a commercial

transaction just by the use of his trade name, as was the case
in Bates end Virginia Pharmacy»

But, rather, he is identifying

the source of the provider of services»
We contend that the identity of the individual is
the more meaningful identification of the source»
QUESTION*

May I ask you a question about Texas law

generally with respect to trade names and trademarks?
MISS PRENGLER*
QUESTION*

Yes, sir,

I suppose you have a statute comparable

to that in any if not all States, providing for the registra­
tion of trade names and trademarks •»- do you?
MISS PRENGLER*
QUESTION*

I believe so, Your Honor»

Now, I realise, under your current law,

you couldn't register the trade name you’re talking about»
But let's assume you have a registered trade name or trademark

35
in Texas,, may it be sold, transferred, assigned?

Is it

regarded as an item of property?
MISS PRENGLERs
Honor*

I would think that it would be, Your

I don’t know, but I would assume that it is*
QUESTIONS

It usually is*

MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTION :

Yes, Your Honor*

Are there any cases in Texas that deal

with this, so far as you know?
MISS PRENGLERs As far as I know, no, sir*
I'm sure that there are, though*

I had not researched

that particular area*
QUESTION:

I’m wondering why you don't argue that a

trad© name is property not speech*
If a trade name acquires a secondary meaning, no one
else can take it away from you.
Wall, you've answered my question,
MISS PRENGLER:

Thank you.

Next, on considering the consumer’s interest in
receiving valuable information, Section 5*13(d) does not
restrict the information that’s received by the consumer*
QUESTION:
question from ms*

May I ask — Justice Powell prompts this
Does your argument that this is not a

violation of the First Amendment, would it apply to another
statute prohibiting the use of trade names in other service
industries?

Forget products. But say in a cleaning business,

36

you couldn’t use the nema ’’Quality Cleaners'5 or something like
that.

Would the State of Texas have the constitutional power

to say, wWa think ’Cleaners’ ought to idsntify the owner and
location and so forth”? would it be the same issue?
MISS PRENGLERs

Only if the State can find the type

of abuses that are present in this particular case.
QUESTIONs
argument?

Well, are the abuses essential to your

That’s really, I guess, what I am asking.
MISS PRENGLERs

Yes, the abuses that were —»

QUESTIONS And if they are essential, and if the other
side were to persuade us that those abuses could be prohibited
by specific prohibitions without also prohibiting the trade
name, does your case then collapse?
MISS PRENGLERs

No.

We would contend that the State

would have a right to restrict the use of a trade name,
assuming that there has to be some reason.
QUESTIONS

Are you making a distinction between a

chain of cleaning establishments, the Quality Cleaners on the
one hand, and other establishments that are dealing in services
relating to health?
MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTION?

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Is that the distinction that you'd make

for Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Stevens?
MISS PRENGLERs
distinction.

Yes, sir, that would certainly be a

The use of a trade name to just sell products

37
would certainly not have the potential harms and consequences
as it would in the health-related field»
QUESTION* What worries me is, how much more
information does an individual in a large city like Big D,
like Dalla, get from the name Nc Jay Rogers or the Rogers
Optometric Corporation?
MISS PRENGLERs

We think that he does get signifi­

cantly more information —
QUESTION*

Well, what is — I mean, they don’t know

Mr» Rogers from a —
MISS PRENGLERs
QUESTION*

But at least —

— baseball bat, do they?

MISS PRENGLERs

No, but at least when the name is

part of the practice, they can have an opportunity to check
out the particular reputation of that optometrist»
QUESTION*

Where?

MISS PRENGLERs

Through their friends, through

acquaintances, they can get more —
QUESTION*

Well, they can check out the company, too,,

Through friends and acquaintances»
MISS PRENGLERs

They can check out the company, but

there may be a hundred optometrists at that company and that
wouldn’t give them the information as to the reputation of
the individual practitioner»
QUESTION*

Well, you don’t know how many people are

38
in Rogers* office either, do you?
MISS PRENGLERs

There are ~ in this particular case,

So I guess that the numbers, the more that you don't

information than just practicing under —*
QUESTION?

But it wouldn’t qualify under your law?

MISS PRENGLER?

That’s correct, because the Legis*»

lature felt that the abuses were so potentially harmful to the
public that they outlawed the trade name practice completely»
The consumer in this particular situation is not
deprived of valuable information as were the consumers! in
Virginia^Pharmacy and Bates» The

consumer is not denied

information necessary to the making of an intelligent decision»

Mr, Keither.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT Q, KEITH, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF N, JAY ROGERS, ET AL,
MR, KEITHs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The trade name in fact communicates a bundle of
valuable information to the consumer, and, respectfully, the
suppression of the trade name is the suppression of speech,
not the regulation of conduct.
This was the holding of the district court in this
particular case, and they relied very heavily, and applied
Virginia Pharmacy and Bates to the facts of our case.

41
And the Court will bear in mind that there ware two
issues that are related to this discussion
QUESTIONs

—

When you say a package of information#

you mean that its quality and reliability and the continuity
of the organisation# is that the sort of thing you mean by the
package?
MR. KEITHs

That is correct»

There is integrity#

there is this bundle of services that are available that#
through the years# and in this instance Dr» Rogers lived in
Beaumont# Texas# he has operated with his brother and with
others for 39 years; he has practiced under the trade name
Texes State Optical»
will.

He has developed a reputation# a. good

There is communicated

between him and members of the

public a substantial body of information# much as you would
say with respect to the Mayo Clinic.

You might take out an

ad in the New York Times and describe all of the accomplish”
mants of the professional members associated with the Mayo
Clinic# and you would not# even then# convey to me or to the
ordinary members of the public the quality of medical care#
the integrity# the attention and devotion to that service.
QUESTION: Well# Mr. Keither# supposing that Dr.
Rogers# instead of being in the optometrist business# was in
the business of murder-for-hire; could he take out an ad in
the paper# notwithstanding a prohibition in Texas law# saying
891 have been a successful murderer-for-hire for thirty years63?

42
MR*, KEITH'S

No, Your Honor, and the Court spoke

specifically to that in the Pittsburgh Press case*

The under™

lying activity, that is murder-for-hire, is illegal and thus
the State may suppress the advertising of that illegal activity,,
QUESTIONa Well, that8s what the State argues here,
too, isn’t it, that the underlying activity, this particular
type of practice is illegal, and therefore he may not advertise
it as such?
MRo KEITH:
QUESTION:

That’s the argument, yes, sir» But —
Well, that again gets a little circular,

it’s illegal because the States made it illegal,,
MR0 KEITH:

That’s correct, but the underlying

activity, that is the practice of optometry, is legal» What
is made illegal is the mere advertisement of the name in
association with the practice» So that the only illegal
activity under State law is the communication of the name,
it’s not the underlying practice itselfa
And, Mr„ Justice Rehnquist, you had asked the question,
if I may respond to it, isn’t this much like the full-disclosure
requirements of the Securites and Exchange Commission»
May I answer that question —
QUESTION:
MR® KEITH:

By all means»
““ in this ways

under the trade name Texas State Optical,

Dr, Rogers practices
He communicates to

the public this bundle of information that is of value and

43

intereat to the consumers,
Furthermore, the evidence shows that in each of his
offices — let us say there is a Dr» Fahey who is the optometrist
present»

Dr» Fahey's name is on the door»

Dr» Richard Fahey ,

Optometrist®
That's factual»

The statute further requires that

if Dr» Fahey is present, his license must be conspicuously
displayed in his office, so that if you or I or any other
member- of the public goes to the office we find that there is
in fact Dr» Fahey and what his license number and registration
is»

His license must be registered in the county of his

residence»

tod, finally, when he completes a State statute-

prescribed examination — and the statute in this instance even
prescribes the test that must be performed for visual examina­
tion — once he has completed the examination and writes a
prescription, he must sign that prescription With his own name®
tod thus, you see that there is three — in this office there
are three classic instances, that is, the name on

the door,

the license on the wall, and the signature on the prescription?
©11 of which are disclosed to the patient® tod in addition
thereto, there is disclosed to the patient the fact that he
is in association with others in the practice of optometry
and that he provides this bundle of services that this name
has come to convey»
QUESTION2

Oh, Xsm sure many securities registrants

44
have taken the position with the SEC that they have disclosed
everything that needs to he disclosed and that, nonafchless,
the SEC has taken the position that "no, you haven’t, you
hav© either not disclosed a fact that ought to be disclosed,
or on© of the statements you’re making is misleading."
And isn’t that what Texas is saying here, that this
particular type of commercial practice tends to mislead the
public?
MRo KEITHs

Well, sir, we have made full disclosure

Let’s put that to rest.
Now, as you get to the subject of "misleading”,
there are at least three responses to that.

To begin with, as

a matter of fact, the district court, and this was a three»»
judge district court, the district court found as a matter of
fact ~ and it appears in Footnote 4 of the Court’s opinion ~
thafc the use of the trade name Texas State Optical was not
misleading.
Secondly, and this takes a little explanation -*»
secondly, the Carp case,
QUESTIONt
MR. KEITHs

and that is the case relied upon by -

The Supreme Court of Texas.
Yes, sir.

The Court will realise that

that cas was tried in Dallas in the fall of 1963, some 15
years ago.

The particular Act in question here was not

adopted and did not become effective until September 1, 1969„
The new Act, and it is a comprehensive, close regulation of

45
optometry — and I can go through it if the Court finds it
necessary ~ the new Act prescribes a variety of ways of
eliminating and precluding fraud? misrepresentation? poor
optometric practices and the like» The Act specifically speaks
to misrepresentation»
Now? when the Act was adopted? it suppressed the
blanket? the blanket suppression of the use of the trade name»
However? it provided an exemption or a grandfather clause
that extends in part until January 1? 1979»
So Dr, Rogers? in some offices? has been exempt from
the trade name provision of the statute ~ not in all offices?
but in some instances»

He has operated under the new Act?

which prevents? and effectively prevents? any type of misrepre­
sentation»

He has operated under the new Act for eight years»

He has operated 65 offices in Texas under the new Act.

At the

time this judgment was rendered by the district court»
There is not one line of testimony? there is not one
witness? there is not even one affidavit? there is not one
suggestion of fact of any deception? fraud? misrepresentation?
dissimulation? confusion? or the like.
/

QUESTIONs

But this is a regulation of business? and

it*s my understanding under the Constitution that States are
entitled to adopt prophylactic rules that perhaps may sweep
more broadly than is necessary? if they are intended to prevent
deception»

That very likely some people who would have no

46

intent

to deceive will be required to cease certain practices

or perhaps disclose more than would be required if you were to
judge each case on an individual basis0
statute is all about,

But that's what a

It avoids the necessity of judging each

case on an individual basis0
MR0 KEITHs

This is, respectfully, Your Honor, a

regulation of speech and not of conduct, The State of Texas,
as Mr* Justice White pointed out in the example to counsel,
the State of Texas did not say that it could have said, "You
can only own one optoxnetric office,

or you can only own three

optometric offices", it did not choose to do so, The State
could have said, "You cannot employ another optometrist,w
Hie State did not choose to do so,

Instead, the State

specifically said, "You may employ other optometrists»"
The State could have said, "You may perform only X
number of examinations per day»"

It did not choose to do so,

The State could say, "You may not practice fraud, deceit or
misrepresentation in the practice,"

The State said that, and

the evidence shows — or there is a complete absence of
evidence of any fraud, misrepresentation or deception, although
there have been operated by the plaintiff in this case 65 offices
for eight years.
QUESTION;

But the State also said, "You may not

practice under a trade name."

And if the State's susbstantive

provision in that regard is permissible, certainly it can

47
prohibit the advertising of a trade name.
MR» KEITH s
business conducto

The substantive provision would be

And the State could otherwise regulate

business conduct without stamping out all elements of speech»
And that's what the State has chosen to da„
QUESTIONi Well, are you saying, then, that when the
State regulates business conduct it must follow some sort of a
least restrictive alternative test that has previously been
reserved for First Amendment cases?
MR» KEITH?

Yes, sir, when it reaches the First

Amendment question, then the State must choose the least
restrictive alternative» And in this instance, as the evidence
shows, there are available to the State a number of other
alternatives that do not suppress truthful, legitimate use
of the trade name»
QUESTION:

Mr» Keith, you mentioned the Carp case»

In that case, the facts, as I recall them, Dr» Carp operated
t-

71 offices around the State and used ten different trade names»
Under the new statute, may one operate under a different trade
name in each community, if he wishes to?
MR» KEITH:
QUESTION:
MR» KEITH?

Your Honor,
Is Dr» Carp still in business?
No, sir, he's not.

QUESTION? Does Dr. Rogers operate under the same name
all over the State?

48
MRo KEITH s

Yes, sir»

And he —

QUESTIONS Could he operate under ten different names?
MR0 KEITHS

Yes, air, unless such practice — and I

think this is the key — unless such practice constituted some
type of fraud, deception or misrepresentation,,
QUESTIONS

In the Ca'pp case,

offices in one city within

Dr» Carp operated three

tvio blocks of each other,? each

under a different name s with the same man supervising them*
Is that still possible under Texas law, assuming you win this
case?
MR0 KEITHs

It would be possible unless, Your Honor,

there were some type of fraud or deception»

Then the statute

speaks
QUESTIONS
MRo KEITHs

Well, the question *~
— and if that becomes deceptive,

then he cannot»
QUESTION:

The question might be whether or not

it’s inherently deceptive0
MRo KEITHs

Yes, sir»

QUESTION: And if it is inherently deceptive, then
the Optometry Act specifically prevents it, and Texas also
has another general and very strong Consumer Protection and
Deceptive Trade Practices Act»
QUESTIONS

And in the Carp case, the optometrist,

as I understood it, could circulate among the 71 offices, so

49
that the one who served you today might be in an entirely
different city next month,,

Is that — do you see any opportun­

A trade name conveys information, meaning­

name of a doctor, only after it acquires the secondary meaning„
MR. KEITHS

Yes, sir.

QUESTION!

And that may be years0

MR. KEITHs

That is true. But in this instance of

the plaintiff in this case, he has acquired that secondary
meaning after 39 years of the highest form of quality,service

afoul of the First Amendment.
Now, -QUESTIONS

Either you say that Texas could not

require that people who -- individual practitioners to use
their own name in the practice?
MR. KEITH;

That is correct, sir.

Because the trade name and the use of the trade name
conveys valuable information.
Nov;, I do not have a constitutional right, as this
Court said, to practice law or to practice optometry; but the
State cannot impose an absolute ban on my expression, under
the guise of professional regulation.
QUESTION;

Well, what information does this — this

is in the commercial area, I take it, isn't it?
MR. KEITH;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir; it is.
What information does that trade name

MR. KEITH;

It conveys information with respect to

integrity, quality of service, price, convenience, availability,,
hours of service, length of service to the community, your
grandmother and my aunt and our next-door neighbor —

That is exactly right»
QUESTION?

Well# weren't we told a little while ago

that unless the person whose name appears spends fifty percent
of his time there# you can’t use that name?
MRc KEITHs

That is the present provision# and that

is the provision that «— that is a part of the prohibition#
the blanket suppression of the use of the trade name.
And that’s what the Texas Court struck down»
QUESTION?

Yes# sir»

But that is# itself# a substantive

prohibition# not a prohibition of speaking about something that
is lawfully permitted»

I think# as Justice White said# what

Texas is saying is that if you're practicing optometry you
may not do so under a trade name# because of the potential for
deceptiveness»
Now# if Texas is permitted to do that# certainly
it’s permitted to prohibit advertisement under a trade name#
you have to argue that it isn't permitted to do# to enact
the substantive regulation»
MR» KEITHs
regulation»

Respectfully# sir# itas not a substantive

It is a suppression of speech# because the very

use of the trade name ~ and that’s what the statute says#
the optometrist may not use the trade name, And the use of the
trade name is what communicates the valuable information to
the consumer»

And so the State has saids

You mav not communi”

56

cate to the consumer this information»
QUESTION s Well, supposing in a securities case the
prospective corporation is named the Alpha Delta Estate, and
the Securities and Exchange Commission decides that that has a
potential for deceptiveness»

Now, do you say that under the

free speech decisions in the commercial area of this Court the
SEC can’t prohibit the communication of that information?
MR» KEITHs

No, sir»

If it has a tendency to

deceive, the SEC can restrict it, the Texas statute restricts
it, and we accept that and do not challenge it*
QUESTIONS But you say the State can’t legislate a
prophylactic rule, that it’s got to deal with it on a case-by™
case basis»
MR» KEITHs Well, not necessarily on a case-by~case
basis* The State can deal with the subject of deception without
prophylactically abolishing all speech*
QUESTION:

What about the subject of trade names?

Can it prohibit a particular optometrist whom it has found to
have used deceptive practices by the trade name from using a
trade name?
MR* KEITH;

No, sir*

Only

the State could prevent

him from using any type of deceptive name*
QUESTION;

Including a trade name?
If it were deceptive* And in this instance

the trial court found as a matter of fact that this is not a

QUESTION s And you feel that, the three-judge district
court has the right to substitute its judgment for the Legis­
lature on that?
MR0 KEITHs

Ho, sir? but it is required to make a

finding of fact as to whether or not this question — this use
is or is not misleading«
QUESTIONs

The three-judge district court in dealing

with a constitutional challenge to a statute is required to
make a finding of fact as to whether a trade name is misleading?
MR* KEITHs

Yes, sir, because if it were misleading,

then there would be no impermissible infringement on speech,
because the Court has held that the State can suppress mis­
leading speeche And so the district court must determines
this truthful or is it misleading?

Is

If it*s misleading, then

you do not have the same free speech right that you have if it
is truthful»
And that's the reason the finding of fact is required
to be made by the court? yes, sir»
The State speaks, and I would like to speak briefly
to the purported justifications for this absolute suppression,
and weigh them respectfully against the consequences or the
harm that falls —
QUESTIONS

White, What they have done, they said "you cannot" rather than,
"you must"»
And there is a substantial difference in the area of
speech»
QUESTION?

Well, is it doing business under a trade

name if you use a trade name and then give all the names?
MR» KEITH?

client could not, with his brother and three others, list
their names and say "associated in the" —
QUESTIONs

But you really wouldn’t care very much,

would you, if you had to put down all the names, you wouldn’t
-- would you really want to use the trade name?
MRo KEITHs

Yes, indeed»

Because the trade name is

valuable, it has a substantial communicative value and thus is
of substantial value to my client»
QUESTION g

You want the value that past activity has

given to it, even though the people are different?
MR» KEITHs

No, sir,

If the people are different,

and if the slack operator, as you described him, this
optometrist has come in, the State could require that before
he adopts that name he must meet certain standards or tests or
not even at all purchase the name» But that’s not what the
State has done here»

They have just made an absolute

suppression,

to be served by such, and this

did not become an oppressive

burden to speech, I would think so, yes, sire
QUESTIONS

Well, is it an oppressive burden on

speech?
MR*, KEITHs

If I'm required to list 200 names on a

letterhead, that would become oppressive, because I couldn't
write anything else on the paper, and thus it would constitute,
I think, an impingement of speech»

But the State has not

done that, Mr. Justice Marshall»

Could the State require it or not?
MR» KEITHs
QUESTION:

Well, ~
You know, you slid right over it, you

said, "oh, it would be all right",

I didn't think you. meant

it then, and I know you don't mean it now„
MR0 KEITHs

Yes, sir, I think the State can require

it until it becomes an oppressive burden and effectively
denies speech*

that it is not unreasonable until it becomes a denial of

QUESTION:
he may not.

In fact, Mr» Keith, is it not true that

QUESTIONS

Do you think there's a higher value on

Dr* Rogers being able to tell the public that TOA, the trade

The consequences of this ban# not to mention the
purely theoretical First Amendment consequences but the immediate and direct consequences of this ban are testified to by
and
Dr» Benham# v^hom . this Court/the Federal Trade Commission
have both cited as authoritative.
One is that since there is less information

and

that is Dr„ Denham's testimony

this results in higher

cost and consequently less use»

As this Court said in Virginia

65

Pharmacy and as Dr„ Benham testified, the moment the price
goes up, the consequences fall heaviest on those who need
glasses the:

most? that is, the ill, the aged and the economic­

ally depressed„
As a result, fewer people are able to obtain the
services or goods that they needo

As a consequence then, in

the aggregate, throughout the country or throughout a large
State like Texas, you have a lower degree or quality of care0
Society and the free enterprise system under the decisions of
this Court suffer substantially because our free enterprise
system depends on an intelligent private economic decision,
and once you constrain information, as this Court and as Dr„
Benham has testified, once you constrain this information,
this results in what the Court has called a misallocation of
resources, which then weakens in turn our free enterprise
system, which is based on full disclosure, respectfully,
rather than less information»

71
MR» KEITHg

May I turn. Your Honor, respectfully,

for a moment to the question of equal protection raised in
the matter of Board appointment?
The reason that Dr. Rogers is not eligible for
membership in the TOA is because Dr» Rogers exercises and
claims a right to exercise his First Amendment rights»
why h® is not eligible

,

'That’s

and that’s exactly what the Code of

Ethics of the Texas Optomefcric Association prescribes»

It

precluded membership to anyone who advertises price? it
precluded membership to anyone who used a trade name? and it
precluded membership to anyone who operated more than three
offices»
He applied, he was not eligible, and he was dis~
qualified from membership»

And he was disqualified because

of the expression of his fundamental First Amendment right»
Whether you call that the right of speech or the right of
association»
And the case becomes much like that of Tnrner__v0
Fouch® decided by this Court in 1970»

Thera the Georgia

statute required that to be appointed to a school board a
person had to be a freeholder»

The Court recognized that none

of us, and certainly Dr, Rogers recognizes that none of us
have a right to be considered for public service.

However •—

that none of us have a constitutional right to be appointed»
But we do have a right to be considered for public service

72

without an invidious, discriminatory disqualification And
the State may not deny to some the privilege of holding office
that it extends to others on a basis that guarantees — that
violates constitutional guarantees»
And that’s exactly what the State has done in this
instance» They have said that "because you exercise your
First Amendment right, there are four of six seats on that
Board that you are not eligible to be appointed to»"
And that is plainly and simply the argument made»
There is respectfully no rational or legitimate reason, for
this regulationi as the colloquy with Mr» Niemann suggested,
if you presume bias against law enforcement by Dr» Rogers «—
and certainly there is no evidence of such in this case —
that would be just like presuming bias to the Solicitor
General, to say that he could not fairly sit and serve as a
judge»

QUESTIONs Well* what if* say* a Governor in appointing
judges says* "I think we need more representation of certain
groups53 * do you think someone who isn’t appointed could challenge

MRe KSITHs

No* sir* I do not„

Until the policy

became discriminatory — until it became a policy that was
discriminatory because of the exercise of a fundamental interest*
such as free speech,,

Until it became the equivalent of State

The equivalents,

MRo KEITHs

Or —

The equivalent of State law* Thank you,
How about the State statute that says

that three members of the commission must be appointed from
the opposite party?

a law and says that ~~ and I think this is done in most States*

MR0 KEITHs

I’m not aware of the basis of the

decision in that respecto
QUESTIONs Well, there are statutes that provide that,

How do

you distinguish them from this statute that you're chcillenging?
MR0 KEITH;

Because in this instance I am excluded

from consideration because I have exercised this fundamental

QUESTION; Well, if there's a Republican vacancy on

the Federal Trade Commission or a Democratic vacancy on the
Federal Trade Commission, presumably all people of the opposite

MR» KEITHs

Yes, sir? but in the course of «-=» we're

Well, then it doesn't mean ’very much,

MR» KEITHs

Except that it represents, Your Honor,

does it?

the fact that not only is there bias in the appointment, but
