PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURNER:

We will hear arguments

against. Bolden and Williams against Brown«
I think we may proceed now, whenever yousre ready,
-Mr, Rhyne.
ORAL-ARGUMENT OF CHARLES 3 0 RHYNE, ESQ., ON
BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, RHYNE:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court,
The issue in the ease that I present to you is
whether Mobile's election system under which it elects its
wostanissioners in at-large ©lections is constitutional,
Now Mobile is a city of 190,0JO people.

)

of them are black.
elected.

One-third

There has never been a black commissioner

And I think that the ultimate issue that is presented

co this Court in this case is whether or not these blacks,
who are the plaintiffs in this case, are deprived of the
,equal protection of the laws.
Are they deprived of equal access and equal
participation in the election system of Mobile, as they allege
in their complaint?
QUESTION:

Can vou tell me, Mr. Rhyne, 1 know the

commissioner form of raunicipal government is a very common
ORe“

kut it'3 one with which I have only a passing familiarity.

4
Commissioners have both executive and legislative
powers?

That's really the big distinction between the

commission form of government and say the mayor-council»

Each

commissioner is el@ct.ad as the finance commissioners, the
safety commissioner or the public works commissioner
QUESTION:

Well, that specialisation has been

ti.u© only fairly recently»

The commission form of government

as I remember it from reading the briefs began in Mobil® in
1911, was it?
MR» RHYNE:
QUESTION;

Yes, it did»
And th© specialisation* at least profes­

sionally , the specialisation, is more recent, isn't it?
m°

RHYNE:

1 believe that as a matter of fact

the specialisation insofar as prescribed by law was laid out
in 1965»

But Mr. Justice Stewart, 2 think it has always —

bi^ difference between the commission

aore llks «** =ity manager form than any other

kind —
QUESTION:

Well, and yet it's unlike it, too.

5
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

It is.
But am I than correct in understanding

that all of the legislative power, and all of the executive
power of the municipality reside in these three commissioners?
MR.RHYNE:

That is true.

QUESTION:

Both powers?

MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

That is true.

They —

All of the power.
If it were a city manager form of

government, of course the city manager is exclusively an
executive.
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:

Yes, that's right.
And the council is the legislature.
That is right.

When I was saying

that when they do the administrative executive work, they're
more like city managers.
QUESTION:

But they also enact the ordinances,

do they?
MR. RHYNE:

They also enact the ordinances.

But

the people know itfhish of the three are responsible for reach
o.n, the functions of th© city.

And as of necessity, this form

©f government, which began around the turn of the century,
was elected to wipe out the corruption — mayor-alderman
form that was causing a lot of problems at that time.
It gives each commissioner absolute responsibility
t© each voter.

6
QUESTION:

Mr» Rhyne# you've just explained that the

people run on a place basis here in Mobile»

Now it seams

to me that I grew up in a place where we had the commission
form of government# but each one was appointed by the mayor
to the public works or public safety or what it was.
But here the candidates run for a specific position?
MR. RHYNE:

Yes# Your Honor# that's true.

1 think

one of the really great things about the field of municipal
government -- and I!v© been in it since 1937 — is# every
city's different when you com© right down to it.

You can't

say that one city is precisely like another# I don't
care how you go about it and how you describe it.
QUESTION;

Isn't there a common denominator in

terms of having them exercise# as Mr. Justice Stewart
suggested both executive and legislative functions?
......... MR. .RHYNE; - Yes „...................................
QUESTION;

That's the common denominator ©f the

commission form# isn't it?
MR. RHYNE;

Yes.

Y@@, it is.

And they have to

Mopfc the policies and then carry them out.
Bl2t 1 fehink fhe major thing is that the
people know when they vote for them that they're voting for
a,is man because he's an expert In finance, and this man, he's
an espert in police safety, and this man because he's an
©Xpert in public works.

1
And regardless of whether or not they run as such,
as they did not prior to 1965„ it was always understood that
this man was running for this post and that man was running
for that post„
QUESTION:

May I ask another question?

Do they run as a tri© on a ticket?

I knew it’s a

non-partisan election? at least that’s what I understand from
th® briefs„
MR. RHYNE?

That’s right»

It is a non-partisan

election»
QUESTION:

First of all, what is the term of a

commissioner?
MR,, RHYNE?
QUESTION:

Four years.
And are they all elected at the same

time?
MR'. RHYNE :
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:

Yes, they are.
And do they run as a slate of three?
No, no.

There is no primary; it’s a

non-partisan election; and "there are no impediments t© anyone
registering»

Anyone qualifying for being a candidate for any

on© of the places, even though theyBre not an expert in finance
©s an expert in one of th© others.

And there’s no question but

what there’s equal participation in the electoral process, and
that th© votes are counted equally.
QUESTION:

And have Negroes been ~ they have run?

8

MR. RHYNE;

Yes»

Now, Negroes have run.

Three

Negroes ran in 19630
QUESTION:
MR, RHYNE:

They ran or they stood for election?
Mr. Justice Marshall, I would say in the

South they stood for election; and you're right.

They

stood for election in 1973, but as the district court pointed
out, they were young, inexperienced, and ran rather limited
campaigns and didn't even carry the black wards.
Now —
QUESTION;

Do they have some prerequisites for

getting on the ballot?
MR. RHYNE;
QUESTION;
MR. RHYNE;
QUESTION;

Non© whatever.
There isn't a filing fee?

I suppose ——

There was a minor —
But there's not a signature requirement?

There must be.
?

MR0 RHYNE;

Now, Mr0 Ehrendal© is here.

H@3s the

great ©Xpert that tried to make an expert oat of ra® »
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNEi
QUESTION;

Well is there a signature —•
But I'm saying there isn't —
There is n@ signature requirement ©f

any substanee?
MR. RHYNE;

N©; absolutely net.

S© anybody can run.

Now this is the first sas® that I know of that has
e<3sm

before this Court that really squarely involves at-large

3

elections at the municipal level.
QUESTION?

Welly Mr. Rhyne, before you go on with

that, you might just tell me why you thought it was important
to say that these commissioners, either formally or informally,
stood for election for certain positions.
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Now, let's just assume that they didn't.

Would your case be different?

Suppose they just ran -- all

they ran was for three commissioners, and no one ever knew
what they were running for except they were running for
commissioners; and they had the full legislative power.
It might so happen that after they were elected one
would assume this kind of an executive responsibility, and one
of them would assume another.

But suppose they just ran, and

when they ran no one understood anything other than that they
were running for three commissioners exercising legislative
power.
Would your case be different or not?
MR. RHYNE:

That's a pretty hard question, but I

would say that my case would not be different.

Because in

every commission form of government that I know of, the people
always know who

that commissioner is running for and who

they 3re voting for.
Now you ve had some — a lot of experienca in
Cincinnati with proportional representation in voting and such.
But I say. coming back to my point that this is the first case

10

before this Court involving at-largs elections.

We have 67

percent of the cities -QUESTION:

Well, 1 take it that your case would be the

same if there were just at-large elections for city councilmen?
MR. RHYNE;:

I would agree, except I think here you

have a special reason, because the people can better hold
these commissioners responsible for their actions because they
know who takes the actions.
QUESTION:

So you do want us to confine our decision

to -- or to address the commission form of government?
MR. RHYNE;:
QUESTION:

Yes.
A commission form of government

where

you run for a spot?
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

Yes; yes„
A city council, generally speaking, has

only legislative power?
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:

That is right.
It is not executive power.
That is right.

And —

Mr. Rhyne
you have a city manager, you have a

mayor that runs the overall.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rhyne, I want to suggest to you that

the commission form of government as you describe it in Mobil®

11
is certainly very different from the commission form of
government as we knew it in New Jersey»

.Mv father was for 13

years a member of the city commission of Newark.
you had as many as 80 candidates.

And there,

And the first 5 were elected.

And then the 5 of them — by majority vote — decided which
Would be the director of public safety, which would be director
of public affairs, and so forth.
And one did not run because he was supposed to be
an expert in any particular field.
MR. RHYNE:

Now, you8re speaking of a county, are

you not?
QUESTION:

No, I'm not.

I'm speaking of the City of

Newark.
We had the commission form of government in New
Jersey for some 25 years in most of the major cities — had
the commission form.
QUESTION:

Well, that takes me back.

[Laughter.j
QUESTION:

It was the mayor who made the assignment

So there are, as you pointed out, variations.

BUt 1 l0i" Mr’ Justioe

^ asking whether your case would

be the same without a place test - standing for a place!
E. RHYNE.

Well, I think that on reconsideration I

would say it would be the same,

I think the election at-large

how many candidates.

But this was county and not city.

And

so —
QUESTION:

I thought you had indicated before that

the distinguishing factor perhaps was that these people
exercise both legislative and executive functions»
MR. RHYNE:

That’s right.
And that that differed — that distinguish©

MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

The county police juries?

Mr. Justice —
Everything's different all over the world.
That's right.
And the judge is a layman in Texas.

MR. RHYNE:

And the judge is a layman in Missouri—

QUESTION:

In the jury — the police jury.

MR. RHYNE:

QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:
But

That's right.
And the judge is a layman in Illinois.

let me get back to this fact:

One ©f the most

interesting things to me is that these plaintiffs have brought
this suit? they have 35 percent black? but never has a qualified

13
black run for office in Mobile»
Now if there's any one thing that this Court can
judicially notice,, and as Mr. Justice Marshall knows better
than anybody else,» it’s this;

When I first started representing

cities in 1937, there wasn't a single black that I know of on
any city council and certainly no black mayors.

Today we

have a tremendous number.
QUESTION;

Well,

. Rhyne, how can you know whether

& particular individual, black or white, is quote qualified

MR. RHYNE;

Well, he has to state his qualifications,

and the people vote for him on the basis of his qualifications.
He puts forth these qualifications inthe race.

MR. RHYNE;

doesn't really run the city.

The mayor, who was Mayor Holmes

probably then, and a city manager generally run the city.
But the thing is that there you've got Mayor Bradley
running out in Los Angeles in a city that is 17 percent black.
He ran once, he was defeated.

He ran the next time and got

elected, and he's got elected over and over again.
And I say around this nation —- and we cite them on

I say that the findings ara based on

Because the expert testified that polari­

zation was lessening all the time.

And there were witnesses

who testified that a black man would have a reasonable oppor­
tunity to win.
QUESTION:

Do we accept those findings for purposes

of our decision, or do we — do you ask us to re-examine them?
MR, RHYNE;
QUESTION:

I ask you to re-exarnine them because —
Is it critical to your case that we

MR. RHYNE:

Not particularly.

I think that

you have here is a legal conclusion rather than a fact.
Because what did the court do?

17
In a voting rights case, you've got to find some
barrier, some obstacle»

Now, in Mobile, you have full

access, full participation by blacks.
QUESTION:

Yes, but Mr. Justice Stevens points out

that the district court says you may have complete access
until the voters get into the voting booth.

And then there’s

voting on the basis of color, and no black has ever been
elected.
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

Well —
Now let’s just assume

MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

that's so.

That is true.
So let's just assume that that is — just

accept those findings.

And you say -- and you say — what

do you say to that?
MR. RHYNE:

I say to that thatthe evidence is that

polarisation is growing less and less all the time, and that
this Court must pay some attention to the fact —
QUESTION:

Yes,but what if we accept the finding —

MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

— that blacks throughout the nation ---- what if we accept the finding that

there is racial voting at the polls?
QUESTION:

Mr. Rhyne, on your polarization is chang­

ing, what about the Klan getting 1,500 members a week in
Alabama?

The Klu

Klux Klan I'm talking about, you know; KKK„

MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

Yeah, I've heard of it.
1,500 members a week in Alabama in the

18
last few months.
MR. RHYNE:

I don't follow its activities quite as

close, I’m afraid.
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:

Well, it’s in the newspapers.
Well —
Local ones.
-- il would say that the Klu Klux Klan,

as far as I know of it, is a fading factor in the South, just
as polarisation of the black vote is fading.
QUESTION:

I thought your argument, Mr. Rhyne, was

that even accepting polarization, nothing in either the Four­
teenth or Fifteen Amendment requires that this at-large form
of election, which has been the form adopted by Mobile since
the year 1911 to be altered.
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

Well —
Even accepting that Negroes vote as

Negroes and that white voters vote as white people.
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

My position —
That there's nothing in the constitution,

the Fourteenth Amendment or the Fifteenth Amendment or any
other part of it that requires Alabama to change its system
of voting?
MR. RHYNE:

That is right.

I think as long as they have equal access arid equal
participation and their votes are counted equally, that's all

19

the constitution requires.
QUESTION:

And they have that.

There’s no one-man-one-vote problem here

under the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. RHYNE:
QUESTION:

No? they’re all equal.
And there’s deprivation of anybody's

voting under the Fifteenth Amendment, based on his race or
color.
MR. RHYNE:

That is right,

this that black vote is decisive.

Because the testimony is

All of the candidates for

commissioner campaigned very hard for the black votes.

On

page 141, 142, 143 you have Rev. Hope say that he feels — he’s
head of the Non-Partisan Voters League —■ he feels that the
three white candidates — three white commissioners who now
occupy those offices — treat the blacks very well.
And we have over and over again the fact that these
commissioners have the open door policy, they see the blacks,
they try to take care of their problems.
Sure they can’t take care of all — all cities have
problems.
QUESTION:

Again, Mi'. Rhyne, did not the district

court find that the blacks were not getting the same services
from their government that the whites were?

Isn’t that the

district court's finding?
MR. RHYNE:

Well, the finding on services, there are

other remedies for that.

20

QUESTION:

I understand„

I'm not saying you

necessarily —
MR. RHYNE;
QUESTION;

Not to tamper with the voting.
Don't we have to deal with the findings

of the district court* rather than changing conditions that
you've described were taking place today?

Or do we?

What — normally* we deal with the findings that the
district court made, and we've got to live with them.
MR. RHYNE;
in a vacuumo

I don't think you can decide this case

I think you have to look at the entirety of the

picture, what's going on in the world today.

1 think that

in this instance, where there is no impediment in the voting
process whatever — everybody can register and everybody
can run —
QUESTION;

Do you think the dominion case would

have been decided differently if there had been a showing
that there was no impediment to the voting process?
MR. RHYNE:

Well, the Oomillion case is entirely

different from this.

The Oomillion case was an out-and-out

discriminatory action.
QUESTION:

We've got no discrimination here.

Suonose this was out-and-out in the

sense that the legislature and the Commissioners said,
"The reason we want to maintain our plans, our commission
form of government, is, we do not want blacks to be in. —
elected as commissioners?"

21

Would it be a different case?
’ITU RHYNE:

Xt could be* but ^ou don8fe have that

You don't have any intentional discrimination.

You

have absolute equality of voters * in the voting process.
QUESTION:

deliberate discrimination in the voting booth.

MR. RHYNE:

Mr. Justice White, there was no such

finding.

Racial voting, whatever you want to call it.
MR. RHYNE:

Well, even on that I'll say that the

testimony was — by the expert. Voiles — that polarisation is
lessening„
And the government, in its brief, concedes

that

race was not an issue in the 1373 election, which was the
last election.
Now, what the court did --- the district court
did — it couldn't find an obstacle, it couldn't find any
impediment, and found that everybody had an unfettered right
to vote.

What it did was, and I quote the court -- the

court concluded that an at-large system is an effective
barrier to blacks seeking public life.
Well, that simply isn't true.

22
QUESTION:
not the record here

Well, does not the record here -- is
that the three Negro candidates didn’t

carry the Negro wards, in conflict to some extent with the
district court's finding,?
MR. RHYNE:

Absolutely.

And then the Court ©£

Appeals went a step further and said that that existing —
that that so-called barrier to blacks seeking public life
establishes the element of intent.
Now, I think that this case is enormously important
because having found that the system itself was the barrier,
all the court could d© but abolish it.

And what did they do?

They wrote an entire new city charter, with the mayor and
nine city councilman, because they said that the only way ~
and I quote the district court again ~ that you ©an provide
olacks with a realistic opportunity to elect blaeks to the
city governing body is to wipe out the existing government
and put in a mayor-council plan with single-member districts.
Now I don't think this Court's in the business ©£
fixing elections or guaranteeing that a person is going to
be able to vote and put in office a man of his own color.
They have an equal right to an equal shot, one-man-one-vote.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rhyne, I suppose it9s only — it'3

jU3C Ch® r@sidential pattern that would allow — that would
ford the kind of a remedy that the district court gave
nare*

23
QUESTION:

Geographically.

QUESTION:

— around the City of Mobile, and yet

the 3ame results had occurred down in th© past that ther®
weren't any blacks elected, the only remedy would be a system
of racial proportionate representation.
The single-member district remedy would only work
because of residential patterns, I take it?
MR. RHYNE:

I think the vicious part — you9re

right — the vicious part of its decision is that it more or
less freezes segregation.
QUESTION:
MR. RHYNE:

You mean residential segregation?
Yes.

If you’re going to chop up Mobile

into nine single-member districts, and the blacks start
moving out of the district, they lose control of it.
So I think that’s really to me, we’ve reached the
point, I say, when color shouldn’t count.

And it hasn’t

eouxited throughout the nation.
And I think this Court should say so, that you’re
not going to provide proportional representation by race,
s'.ou never have.

In decision after decision

Equal votes, yes.
pation , yes»

you’ve said n©0

Equal access, yes.

Equal partici­

But not proportional representation by race.

QUESTION:

In fact proportaionl representation —

that is the Harris system of proportional representation —
has existed I think only in two municipalities in th® United

New York City for awhile, and Cincinnafefei, Ohio,

for a longer period.»

And that was attacked as being uncon­

stitutional at one stage,
MR, RHYNE:

Yes,

And it didn't work very well

either place,
QUESTION:

Well,

one could argue about that,
?

MR„ RHYNE:

All right.

But Maury Seitzengood

who put it in in Cincinnati told me it wasn't working very
good, and so you got rid of it.
But I6m saying that proportional representation
by race is not guaranteed
QUESTION:

Well, we know what was wrong with it in

Yes.

MR. RHYNE:

1 didn't quit® understand you, Mr.

Justice —
QUESTION:

In New York, the communists got elected

every time.
QUESTION:

In Cincinnati, I got elected.

[Laughter.]
MR. RHYNE:

You know, I thought in working on this

case, really, one of the most interesting things was the
footnote that Mr. Justice White wrote in Whitcomb v. Chavis
where he points out that a white man won in a black ward and

25
a black man won in a white ward»

And I hop© that I live feo

see the day where that is America,,
Because if you start carving up cities just because
you've got to guarantee black seats on the governing board?
you're going to have to carve up an awful lot of cities»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Blacksher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES U. BLACKSHER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES.
MR. BLACKSHER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I would like t© begin by responding, if I may, to
some of the questions eoneerning the Commission form of
government in Mobile.
Briefly, the history of commission government in
Mobile as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, it began in 1911.
Th® °riginal

-not require, but did authorise, feh©

commissioners, one® they were elected, to divide up tha
executive functions among themselves.

And it certainly was

the practice and custom in Mobil®, almost from the beginning,
for the commissioners to do this.
In fact, it is not a matter of record in this case,
but there was a lawsuit in the 1920 'a by some politicians
who were unhappy that the Commission had adopted that course,
rather than acting as a board of directors in common,
QUESTION;

You mean that after the election they

then decided which ©ne was to take what?

26
MR. BLACKSHER:

That’s correct.

And in 1939, it’s

further my understanding, that the law was explicitly changed
to provide for one place to foe the mayor in advance of the —*
in advance of the election; and the two associate commissioners
would be assigned executive functions after the election.
That plan also ran into some technical problems in
the Alabama state courts, and it ended up in 1965, the first
time

the executive functions of the three commissioners

were designated by law before they ran.
We would like to point out that the plaintiffs in
this case never objected to the retention of a commission
form of government which permitted the use of single-member
districts.

It was the position of the defendant city in

this case, from the time it filed its answer to its arguments
and pre-trial motions, the pre-trial document, pre-trial briefs
and on into the Court of Appeals, that the assignment of
executive functions to the three commissioners foreclosed —
absolutely foreclosed — any remedy in this case.
fact, 1 think was the keystone of their de­
fense.

Based on their representations, which can also be

round, by the way, in their answer on page 33 of the — of
■he appendix, that in order for single-member districts to
be provided in Mobile, a change in the form of government
would have to come about.
The Court, acting in its equitable discretion, when

27
•I

it was forced to give an order of its own, when the City of
Mobile and the State ©f Alabama, after the Court3s invitation,
to supply some legislative response to the infirmities of the
at-large election system, then the court, taking the advice
of the defendants themselves, changed to an optional form of
government, which is provided in the State of Alabama by
other statutes»
The State

of Alabama has several optional forms of

municipal government, including the now-ancient mayoraldermanie form of government which Mobile was using back in
1900; including a new mayor-council — a newer mayor-council
form that was devised specifically for Mobile in 1963? and
including the special legislation that governs Montgomery,
for example, and Birmingham, which have adopted the so-called
strong mayor that everyone at this trial agrees was prefer­
able to the weak mayor where the council could interfere in
the day-to-day business ©f the executive.
But to repeats

It is true that the plaintiffs in

the end, when asked fe© propose a remedy, suggested a change
t© a mayor-council, only because the defendants were urging
that any other — any other use ©£ a form of government in
th© context ©£ single-member districts would b© inequitable
and inappropriate in Mobil®„
The Court's remedy leaves open to th© State of
Alabama the option ©f adopting by legislation a Commission

28

form of government that does permit of the use of single­
member districts? that is still open to Alabama if it wishes
to use it.
But there has been no movement on the part of
anyone in the legislature or in city government to see or
to bring about such a change.
QUESTIN:

Could the City do it unilaterally, or

does it take State legislative action?
HR. BLACKSHERs

The City took the position from the

beginning that it lacked -- entirely lacked any authority
to change its election system or its form of government.

And

that in fact we had to look to the legislature of Alabama
for our remedy.
>

It filed a motion to strike our prayer for relief
that a — that the election system be changed to singlemember districts, because they lacked the authority to provide
that relief.
QUESTIONs

Well, is it your position that the

discrimination in this case was effected in the voting booth?
Is that where the —
HR. BLACKSHERs

Not exactly, Mr. Justice White.

We

do not take the position that voters are somehow practicing
a prohibited ~ eonstutionally prohibited form of discrimi­
nation when they vote along racial lines.
What ©«r position is, is that given that situation,

29

a situation which, by the way, has been reinforced

by 100

years of official state action —
QUESTION:

A city should not provide the kind of

system that makes effective that kind of voting? is that it?
MR, BLACKSEER:

That's absolutely correct.

In Mobile I doubt that one could devise an electoral
form that more carefully and distinctly focused the —
QUESTION:

So you say —

MR. BLACKSEER:
QUESTION:

-- electoral power —

— at large voting is just —■ in a city,

say, is out — is unconstitutional if over a period of
time a —- a substantial black — or some other minority —
a group, is without representation? and that the court finds
that there's discriminatory voting.
MR. BLACKSEER:

Polarised voting.

We do not even

say that ©very atr*large system, under those circumstances,
would have the «rescribed effect.
After all, as someone here pointed out, there —•
in a true at-large system — in a true at-large system, as in
this case, the top three vote getters would be elected, and
you can have plurality victories.
And it may have been that under such a system
blacks in Mobile representing 33 percent of the population
would have had the clout —
QUESTION:

Well, what would you do in this case if

30

blacks and whites had been equally distributed throughout
the city?

What would have been your remedy?
MR. BLACKSHERs

We — Mr. Justice White, you’re

correct that we would have had no remedy through the
districting

formula.

And in the first instance, we think that it’s unrea
listice to consider such a possibility.

Hence if, in fact,

blacks and whites were residentially homogenized throughout
the entire district it is unlikely that the social phenome­
non of polarized, racial voting would have occurred in the
rirst instance.
N

But

occur in that circumstance, I think

it- s clear that th® ©lection form — at-large voting —
WOUld not be the specific cause of the dilution of their
vote.
QUESTION:

What inferences —

MR. BLACKSHER:

Changing the districts would not

provide them such a remedy.
That issue, of course, is not presented here,

is

the evidence was - and the court found - that Mobile was
one of the Boat racially segregated cities in the country.
QUESTION:

What inferences should be drawn, if any,

from the fact that if you had districts representation here,
the three Negro candidates who ran would not have been
elected in their own predominantlv Negro districts?

31
MP. BLACKSHER;

Yes, sir, that was a factual issue

that was debated at great length in the trial court»

And

all of the facts indicated in the trial court finding, and
the Court of Appeals affirmed its finding, that it was only -it was an indication that no well-known, well-financed black
candidate was even going to attempt a race in the City of
Mobile, where all of the politicians, including the defendants,
conceded that it took $30™ to $50,000 to wage a successful
campaign; when all of the black politicians including the
Non-Partisan Voters League, represented to the Court that they
woir&dtsrbt even attempt to launch a black candidate, given
the^pattern of racially polarized voting.
This was a situation where the one champion of
black interests in the City of Mobile, a white commissioner
?
named Joe Langen, had been defeated by that same racially
polarized voting.
His situation provided the centerpiece of the
evidence, I think, in this case.

And blacks in this case

did not contend that they had a right to have a districting
remedy that would permit them to elect blacks.

They wished

to elect a candidate of their choice.
They w@r@n8fe — the evidence indicates they were
not even permitted by the white majority to elect a white
candidate who was at all connected with or in any way -QUESTION;

Well, how were they prevented from doing

*

32
it?
MR. BLACK5HER:
QUESTIONS

1 beg your pardon, sir?

You said the Negroes weren’t allowed t©

elect the man of their own ehoie®.

And my question was;

How

were they denied that right?
MR. BLACKSHER:

They were denied that right by the

biaek voting white majority operating in an at-large election
system that involved a majority vote requirement —
QUESTION;

Well, I understand from Mr. Rhyn© that --

maybe you can help ~ he wants to know the constitutional
provision that prevents white people from voting for white
People, and Negro or black people from voting for black people.
MR. BLACKSHER*

There is no such constitutional

provision, may it please the Court.
QUESTION:

I thought so.

So you agree with him on

that?
MRs BLACKSHER!
QUESTIONs

W© certainly do; always have.

But you d© @ay that given the fact of

polarisation, as it’s been referred to generally in the ea@®,
ife dG@B a@t r**«ir® a finding ofintent in the structuring of
the governmental unit t© discriminate?
MR* BLACKSHER*

is th@ position w© take.

The

Court of Appeals took the position that under the ©qual
protection

cause

of action, such a finding of intent was

required,- at least feha majority ©pinion did.

And although it

did — it did sort of indicate that feh@ intent would not b©

33
required under a — wellf 1’ra sorry» the majority did hold
as well that the Fifteenth Amendment would require a showing
of intent»
But it is our position» Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that
neither the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment,
certainly not the

Voting Rights Act, requires that a district­

ing system, which operates t© minimiz@ or cancel out the
voting strength of a protected minority requires a demon­
stration that that electoral waysbsra was motivated in th©
first instance, or at any point in time, by an invidious
motive.
QUESTIONs

How about election for the Governor of

Alabama?
MR. BLACKSHER:

¥©ur Honor, the governor of Alabama

is an executive function? it is on© office? he must run —
QUESTION:

Well, all th© executive power ©f th®

government of Mobile is lodged in these three Commissioners,
I understand.
MR. BLACKSHER:
QUESTIONs

That’s correct.

To that extent, there's no difference.

MR. BLACKSHER %

That's correct» except afehat what

we don't foreclose is the possibility that the commission
system could hsav<® been retained where all thr@® would have
elected -- wuwould have exercised the executive power, and
still have been elected in single-member districts, and

34
without violating the Voting Rights or equal protection clause
of any of the citizens of Mobile who elected them from singlemember districts.
We say that that certainly is an option which is pur­
sued in other cities; has not been challenged, and was not
directly challenged in this ease*
QUESTION;

You think the constitution *■— ultimately

what you're saying is, if I understand it, is that the
constitution requires that one of these three commissioners
be a Negro?
MR. BLACKSHER:
QUESTION:

No, Mr. Justice Burger, we’re not.

Well, that’s the thrust of your argu­

ment, isn’t it?
MR. BLACKSHER:

It is — we’re saying that the

constitution requires that in a situation where there’s bloc
voting as powerful and as rigid as it is in Mobile, the
constitution requir@g that an ©lector©! system b© provided
'which gives blacks an opportunity to have their preferences
registered inthe elections.
QUESTION;

Wellf my ~

MR. BLACKSHER;

And

their preferences may or.may not

be a black candidate.
QUESTION:

Voters don’t always ~ and many times, I’m

sure you've shared this experience with me and with many others
or our fallow citizens — your

preference hasn't been

35

nominated by either party, or by any party»
MR. BLACKSHER;
QUESTION?

That’s comet.

So you're voting not between first

choices of yoars„
MR. BLACK8HEK:

Not ~ every voter doesn't have a

right, of course, to have his preference registered on
occasion.

But the concept of dilution grew out ©f this

Court’s one-person-one-vofc© line of eases,
QUESTIONs

Yet that’s not involved her®, is it?

MR. BLACKSHERj

Th© mathematical concept of one™

person-one-vot® is not.
QUESTION s

But that’§ whet that concept was in

Reynolds v, Sima.
MR. BhACKSHER;

That is not whafe Forteon v, Dorsey

and
QUESTION £

No, 1 know.

But th© original on@~p@r@on-

©no-vote was purely a mathematical concept, wasn’t it?
MR. BLACKSHER:

Th@ specific concept in Reynolds

was a mathematical concept.
QUESTION 2

Exclusively.

MR. BLACKSHERz

But the language ©£ Reynolds is

much broader than that, may it please the Court.

And it

talks about th® right of every American citizen t© h®v® a
full undiluted equally weighted vote.
And from the bag-inning ©£ that line ©f eases, this

36
Court has recognized —
MR» BLACKS HER :

Well, now ~ go ahead? excuse me»

MR« BLACKSHERs

— has recognised that in laying

down the rules, that such a dilution or debasement ©f a
person's vote could occur by a geographical apportionment
scheme? by mathematics,, as you say»

That in providing a

remedy for that, a State or local government could go to an
at-large ©lection system»
QUESTIONS

Well, before you get fe© the question of

remedy, let's talk about a question ©f constitutional
violation»
Do — you say it doas not hsv@ to h@ by Intent, I
take it?
MR. BLACKSHER:

That is ©ur position? that's

correct.
QUESTION:

Now supposing that Mobil© instead of

being roughly 65-35, was 85-15, and they had had a long
standing three commissioners at-large system.
And -- could the district court then tell them
that they had to go fromthree commissioners fee five commis­
sioners, because even three commissioners split up geographical!
would not ©table the Negro population to have a representative
on the eoraeil?
MR. BLACKSHER:

If the system operated, given all

the premises ©£ the hypothetical question, that ther© was

3?
rigidly polarised voting which strictly precluded now on
every occasion consistently over a period ©f feim© the
preferences of the 15 pereant black minority from being
registered inth© at-large system, then there would toe function­
ally no difference from a districting system in which blacks
were in one district» had no representatives» and whites were
in one district that had all of the representatives; that's
©ur position.
QUESTION;

And you'd make the same argument about

Catholics» or Jaws, ©r any other identifiable groups that
lived on some areas» 1 suppose?
MR. BLACKS HER:

Italians» Poles

W© don't attempt to make that

argument her®» Mr. Justice Whit®.

But the argument might b©

mad© —
QUESTIONS

Well» it sounds to m® like you're making

it.
MR, BlACKSHEls

The argument might b© mad© under

the precedents this Court has established» if it could b®
shown by Catholics — and 1 would point out that in ©ur
@*p©ri©n©@ it hse not bees as a matter of fact possible to
show this — that Catholics consistently voted as & bloc —

or rather that the majority ©£ noa-Catholies consistently
voted as a bloe — t© defeat Catholic candidates'

over a

period ©£ time„
QUESTS©!?
question?

Well» what's th® factual answer to my

That isn't what I asked you*

38
MR. BLACKSHER:

Well, whether or not the cas©

applies t© Catholics or Poles or other groups which simply
©f coarse requires additional consideration ©f other
factors.
Bat th@r® can b® n© doubt that the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendment was passed primarily to protect the
noting rights of blacks.
QUESTIONS

The Fifteenth says so.

MR. BLACKSHERs

Th® Fifteenth Amendment is explicit

on that point.
QUESTION s

Let m© come back to a point I suggested

to you before about the fact that th© two Negro candidates
couldn’t even carry feh@ir own districts.

And you responded

by saying — at least as 1 understand it -- that the Negro
leaders in the community knew that it was futility t© run and
&© they didn’t bother putting up good candidates.
But that’s a good deal of speculation.

That’s

really not hard evidence.
QUESTIONt

Your whole argument's about bloc voting.

Sloe voting are undermined by this reality that’s in th©
record, that th© Negroes didn’t vote for Negro candidates.
MR. BLACKSHER:

Mr. Chief Justicet there was plenty

of evidence in the resord of wher® black® had run in th©
City ©f Mobil© for ©th©r governments,, such as th® school
boardf the legislaturee had attempted time and again t© seek

39
election, and had been defeated by a solid bloe vote by the
majority ©f whites, as well as otherwhite candidates both in
the city commission ©lections and in school board elections»
QUESTION?

Well, who has the case or controversy

with whom here?
MR„ BLACKSHER:

The ease

or controversy is between

the plaintiff clients, the black citisens of Mobile, and the
j

State of Alabama, operating through its agency, the state
of Mobile.
QUESTION:

What case or controversy does the

named — do the named plaintiffs have with the City of
Mobile■?
MR. BLACKSHER:

The case in controversy involves

the lawfulness and the constitutionality —
QUESTION:

Have thev ever run?

Have they ever run

or wanted to run?
MR. BLACKSHER:

The evidence was that they have

frequently run in the past? had expressed a desire to run in
the future —
QUESTION:

These named plaintiffs?

MR. BLACKSHER:

John LaPlore, for one, ran for the

state legislature as soon as the Federal court in Montgomery
provided single-member districts that provided him a reason­
able opportunity to be elected.
May it please the Court, I would like to point out
-hat contrary to Mr. Rhyne's opening statement, that this

40
case is strictly an equal protection case? that there are at
least four independent legal theories supporting the judgment
below.
The Court is confronted with the findings of fact
of two courts beloxv, that Mobile's at-large election system
has not only the effect but the purpose, the motive, of
descriminating against black voters.
Based on these findings, this Court can affirm the
judgments below first on the Voting lights Act of 1965,
which explicitly prohibits any election laws which have the
purpose or effect of abridging blacks' voting rights; secondly,
on the Fourteenth Amendment cause of action growing out of
-——-6 V

ifllo

v^_Chavis — and I would like to

point out to this Court, stopping there

momentarily, that

the evidence in this case is even stronger in all the
critical aspects than was the evidence in White v. Reaester.
Thirdly, the constitutional prohibition against any
f’tatS law that has ~~ that is supported by a racial —
invidious racial motive.

And fourth, the Fifteenth Amendment

which provides and proscribes
any state lav/ which has either
the purpose or effect of abridging the voting rights of blacfcs.
i mini: that —
QUESTION:

Mr. Blacksher, supposing in Chicago the

UnCl1 deolded they didn’t want anymore Republicans.
And they passed an at-large system there which would have
effectively excluded Republicans from the city council.

And

41
I suppose the Republicans are a group that are entitled to
equal protection.
Under your theory, would that be unconstitutional?
MR. BLACK SEER:

Your Honor, we simo-ly

take a

position on whether or not Republicans are protected.

I —*

in thinking about that question, it certainly occurs to me
first of all that political parties are vehicles that we have
in this society as a convenient means for carrying on the
political dialogue itself.
QUESTION:

The significant thing about them, I

suppose, is, they vote as blocs.
MR. BLACKSHER:

They vote as blocs, that is correct.

But the question is whether they -- whether the vote against
them is invidious in nature.
QUESTION:

Well, that5s because we don't want the

members or this bloc in our legislature? does that make it
invidious.
MR. BLACKSHER:

Not ~ no, sir; certainly not on its

face.
QUESTION:

Well, then are you saying that a political

party, if it's frankly a political party like the Republicans,
are not entitled — they can be subjected to discrimination
simply because they're Republicans?
MR. BLACKSHER:

I’m saying — I'm trying to avoid

taking a position one way or another, simply because it

' o-.‘(--i clearly ait ferent kinds of issues which require

42
thorough exploration.
QUESTION:

Would this ease be different if the — if

all the black citizens in Mobile organized a political party
called the Black Political Action Group, or something like
that?
MR. BLACKSHER:

It would be different if it showed

that the bloc voting was on the basis of the ideas and the
positions — the ideologies, that ware espoused by this particu­
lar organization, which crossed racial lines.
The constitution forbids invidious discrimination on
the basis of race.

The Voting Rights Act forbids invidious

discrimination on the basis of race.
QUESTION:

I thought you said bloc voting was all

right on race.
MR. BLACKSHER:

With respect to the constitutional

rights of citizens of this country to vote in a bloc fashion,
of course.

The question is whether the state can reinforce

and guarantee the defeat of the minority through a particular
election form, which is done in this case.
QUESTION:

oh, you don't agree with Mr. Rhyne any­

more?
MR. BLACKSHER:

i — there's been very little that

we've agreed on in the course of this litigation, Mr. Justice
Marshall.
i would like to close by pointing out that after the
White and Whitcomb cases,

and the Voting Rights Act may have

43

been analysed to death, but that the issue from my clients'
standpoint very simply is whether or not they will be permitted
to enter at last the mainstream of politics in the City of
Mobile.
If this Court stands by .its prior precedents in
White, in Whitcomb, if it observes the Congressional intent
behind the Votings Rights Act, if it observes the precedent
it established in Comillion v. Lightfoot and Arlington
Heights regarding a racially motivated state law; then given
the findings of fact made by two concurrent courts below,
the judgments below must be affirmed.
QUESTION;
district court?

Well, do you have that finding by the

Look at page 32b of the jurisdictional

statement„
I thought that Judge Pittman came right up to the
nurdle andthen klnd of backed off of it, saying that Washing­
ton v. Davis hadn’t changed the dilution cases, and it
VMSn t ~~ no intent was required there, and so we didn’t find
it.
See the top of page 32b there.
MR* H’bACKSHER:

What the argument — x think it’s

important to note. Hr. Justice Rehnquist, that the argument
thSt "h® °oar“ ls r«J*°ting here is the argument that the
defendant city depended on throughout trial, and that is, that
the plaintiffs had to show intent in the origination, in the
enactment of the statute.

44
You'll notice that the court says that Washington
v. Davis did not establish a new Supreme Court purpose test
that requires initial discriminatory intent.
The preceding paragraph contains the finding that
there is a current condition of dilution of the black vote
resulting from intentional state legislative inaction.
Now, we fought through the lower courts — both the
district court and the Court of Appeals — this argument that
it we couldn't prove that in 1911 there was a racial motive
involved, then we were out of court.

And that is an issue

that the district court was addressing in that passage.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES P. TURNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS
AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING APPELLEES
MR. TURNER;

Mr. Chief Justic®, and may it pleas®

the Court;
W© appear as amicas to urge th© Court to affirm
the judgments below in both numbers 77-1844 and 78-357, which
will b@ argued nesst.
Although there ar© slight differences in the legal
analyses which are apparent, I believe, from th® briefs, we
concur fully with th® appellees that the maintenene® ©f the
at-large voting system for Mobile City commission and school
commission, in th© circumstances of these eases, violates the
equal protection clauset and alternatively and independently,
the Fifteenth Amendment.
On the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause,
our analysis is like that of th© Court of Appeals and accepts
tn® faGt that

requires aggrieved parties

to make a prima facie showing that th© challenged system is
purposefully discriminatory.

46
Dor submission is that the exhaustive records in
these cases demonstrate such purposeful discrimination?that
the careful factual findings made by the district court and
thoroughly reviewed by the Court of Appeals should be given
great deference? and

that the at-large ©lection system cannot

be sustained in these circumstances because it impairs if
not submerges meaningful access to the political process on
the basis of race.
The starting point of our analysis is Whit® V»

of White is that the ultimate inquiry is whether black citizens

HR. TURNER:

I think only a minority have what would

be comparable to Mobile’s commission system.

Most of those

elected at large.
However, there is a small number ©f those that are

Th® first criteria, then, under White v. Regester
is that there be a present disparate effect.

The at-large

system in these eases has produced no black elected officials?
certainly hno on© contends that this is th© @nd of th© inquiry,

48
but it is the beginning.

The ©scelusion of one-third of all

of Mobile residents from representation and public office is
consistent with the discriminatory purpose.
Second, Whit® v. Register category of factual inquiry
is the history ©f racial discrimination in the jurisdiction,
of such a nature, I would take it, from Washington v. Davis,
that it suggests purposeful action.
This record documents a history ©f opposition to
effective black exercise of the franchise that is both long
and strong.

And we’ve set out &s much as we could in ©ur

brief soma details of that history.
The high rights include that right up until the
time of trial, a single Mobile state senator had vetoed
consideration of single-member districts for the city.
Another high right is that the state legislature,
which would have to approve any changes in local government
such as this, was singularly unresponsive.

The question here, I take it, is what officials do after

We conclude, in short, that all ofthe factors

findings below, affirmed by the Court of Aopeals.

We urge

that you give great deference to them, and turn to the Fifteenth
Amendment„
If our conclusion is right, that the at-large system
in Mobile has given white voters the means to abolish or
abridge the effective black electoral participation because

of race, it necessarily follows that that violates the
fifteenth Amendment.
But a second part of our submission here is that
independently the fifteenth Amendment provides a basis foraffirming the judgment.
Now, we get that out of the white primary cases.
We say that in the Terry v. Adams, the Jaybird Club was a
discriminatory private organization, but because the state
magnified that discrimination, and made it meaningful in
elections, that this Court turned it down and said that that
violated the Fifteenth Amendment.
In many ways, the Fifteenth Amendment is a much
cleaner and more direct way of dealing with this question.

There is the distinction that ’lr. Justice

This is a classical — in my judgment — equity
case.

The record shows — and I urge you to read the record,

because it's very revealing — that in all forms of political
activity in Mobile, Mobile city, Mobile county, Mobile
countv commission, race is never very far from the surface.
White voters, the majority, set aside, under this
record, all ether considerations when race is injected either
in the form of a candidate or his or her supporters; not only
are blacks unable to win, but the whites they support get the
kiss of death, and the only way blacks have political

The — Section 2 of the 1965 Voting

proscribes discrimination in voting on the basis of race.
Our original nerception was that while certainly
Section 2 would be violated if the Fifteenth Amendment was
violated, that vou don’t save much constitutional energy by
addressing Section 2.
Appellees will argue that that’s incorrect, and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. RHYNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF ov THE APPELLANTS
MR. RHYNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, I wasn't sure that I

had any minutes left, but let me answer one question from
Mr. Justice Stewart.
According to the municipal yearbook, and I guess
it's fairly accurate, 67 percent of all the cities have
elections at-large.
Now, the government here, in its brief, says the
measure of the effect of an electoral system is not the — pro­
portional representationt but fair representation.

And I

say to this Court that as they review the record in this
case, they're going to find that blacks have been fairly
represented in Mobile.
We quote, on pages 10 and — I'

guess 9 and 10,

Rev. Hope, who heads the Non-Partisan Voters League, and he

59

says that the current commissioner's fairly represent the
blacks in Mobile.
And for 16 years there was a commissioner, Mr.
Langen, who was noted for the fact that he represented the
blacks.

I don't think that the blacks orwere indeed —

their support — the kiss of death.

He was there an awful

long time.
Now, in conclusion, I believe very strongly in the
right to vote -— in an equal vote.
Mobile provides here.

And I believe that's what

It provides equal access to the

voting system; errual participation in that system? and an
enual count of those votes.
I think that’s all the constitution requires.

And

nolarization is the onlv thing they’ve offered here to prove
invidious discrimination; and I don't think that's enough.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURNER:

Mr. Allen.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM II. ALLEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 78-357
MR. ALLEN:

Thank vou, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:
Mv part of these proceedings concerns the
constitutionality of the way Mobile county's school commis­
sioners are elected.

And since no later than 1836 these

commissioners, the members of the Mobile County School Board,
if vou will, have been elected by the voters of the county

60

at large.
They were so elected when this action was brought
bv black residents of the county, complaining that this
at-large electoral system unconstitutionally diluted their
voting power.
As you have heard, blacks make un about a third of
the nonulation of Mobile County; slightly greater proportion
of the nonulation of the city itself, but it's around a
third of the entire county.
The district court sustained th'e aplaintiff’s
complaint, and the Court of Appeals summarily caffirmed.
The issue that is nosed bv that decision is whether
an at-large method of election in a school district that has
a significant black minority is unconstitutional merely
because there is racially polarized voting, and black minority
candidates have not been elected to the board, however deeply
rooted the at-large election method may be in history and
non-racial policy.
I hone in describing the proceedings and the
decisions below to demonstrate that the case noses the issue
just that baldly.

Then I'll try to explain why the

resolution of that issue by the district court and the Court of
Appeals is inconsistent withthe Fourteenth and Fifteenth
.Amendments, and with this Court's decisions construing them.
First, the facts, and how they give rise to the

61

issue as stated.
The long-standing commitment of Alabama to the
at-large elections of the members of the governing body of
the Mobile Countv schools is undoubted.

The Mobile public

school svstem was established in 1826, 28 years before a
statewide svstem of schools, public schools, was established
in Alabama.
Either that original enabling act in 1826, which
seems to be ambiguous, or if not that, then a replacement
statute that was enacted in 1836, established a system of
at-large election that has prevailed continuously since.
As your Honors mav have learned from the perusal of
the briefs, the statute that provided for single-member
districts was enacted in 1975, but was voided because of a
technical defect in the giving of notice.
The original provision for the at-large election of
■'Mobile County school commissioners in the earlv 1800 !s and
the enactment in 1919 of the at-large election legislation
that governs today were not motivated by any consideration of
the impact that at-large voting
QUESTION:

might have on black residents.

Suppose at the time of -- whether it

would be 1836 or later — only white people voted; only white
people were elected to the school board; and only white
students went to the schools.
ME. ALLEN:

And no one thought of the possibility

that blacks might vote, at that time, 1836«,

At — in 1919,

when the present enabling statute was enacted, blacks had
been effectively disenfranchised in Alabama by the
constitution of 1901, a situation that prevailed until about
the time of the Second World War, and shortly thereafter.
Now there’s another key fact, that appears from the
record.

Notwithstanding the history, of which we're all

aware, and to which government counsel referred, of racial
discrimination in manv, many aspects of the life of Alabama,
there are today no formal or informal barriers to full partici­
pation bv black residents in the political process in Mobile
County, including, in particular, school board elections.
Blacks are able freelv to register .Tad to vote.
They participate in both parties in the partisan process that
leads to the election of school board members.

Any candidate

who’s interested in running for the school board may do so.
And it doesn't cost much to run for the school board.
QUESTION:

Is there any controversy in this case

about what you just told us?
MR. ALLEN:

Up t© this point, I am paraphrasing

findings of the district court.

T am paraphrasing findings —

he did not advert to this other possible obstacle, the
campaign costs.

But in fact there's testimony that it costs

no more than $5,000 — more usually about $2,000 — to mount
a nerfectly effective campaign.

MR. ALLEN:

They are non­

partisan ,
Now as I 've indicated — what I've recited hereto­
fore are findings made by Judge Pittman and accepted by the
Court of Anneals.
Judge Pittman also found that there was racially
o'iar i zed voting in ‘■chile County»

And h*

said further that

66
this tendency to vote according to race made it dirricult for
a black person, a member of this minority, to be elected to
the school board in an at-large election»
In fact, four black candidates ran for the school
board between 1962 and 1974 .

Each of them was running for

office for the first time; each of them reached the runoff;
none was elected.
Judge Pittman looked at these facts in the course
of an analysis of the case that he felt himself compelled to
follow because of the Court of Anneals decisions in Zimmer
va McKeithen and other cases that had followed Zimmer which
have made the Zimmer factors decisive in ^ifth Circuit voting
dilution cases.
You can't really understand what happened below
without knowing

something about these Zimmer factors.

And the

~irst Zimmer factor that Judge Pittman analyzed relates to
minot!fey access to this slating or candidate-selection process.
He made a finding, nominally a finding, that blacks
were denied eaual access

to the slating or candidate

selection process — I'm quoting there.

But this finding was

obviously a mere function of his view that potential black
candidates were discouraged from running because of the history
of losing elections.
And the candidates lost those elections because
tue/ were members of a racial minority in a community in
which there was racially polarized votincr.

67

I submit that in truth that is to say nothing more
than that racially polarized voting has prevailed in Mobile
County.

That is all that that lack of access conclusion —

I will not dignify it by calling it a finding by the district
court --- amounts to.
QUESTION:

The slating is a sort of nomination —

MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Nomination —
— by an organized group of candidates,

MR. ALLEN:

That's right.

from running in the Democratic primary.

One is freely able

to run -- and there's no organization that controls who has
access to the nrimarv.

If you’re a Democrat.

Well, suppose in Mobile it's run the

way it is, but in an adjoining city, Democrats always win the
general elections, but the candidates who get put up are
chosen by the Democratic party in its own little conclaves,
at a convention, or in a backroom somewhere.

And it's freely

conceded that in the choosing of the Democratic candidates
in the general election that there is racial voting?
MR. ALLEN:

Racial voting, nothing more than that,

And in the back room, they all — they

The —- I will skip over for a moment a couple of the

Zimmer factors that the district judge looked to, and just
state that his overall conclusion was quite predictable.
He paraphrased nassages from some of this Court's voting
dilution opinions, and then he concluded that the plaintiffs
had met their burden by showing an aggregate of the factors

75
catalogued in Zimmer.
And the court’s remedy for this constitutional
violation it therefore found was also predictable.

Judge

Pittman professed not to endorse quota voting,, or quota
elections; but he adopted a plan that was designed — these
are his words -- to provide balcks a realistic opportunity
to elect blacks to the board of school commissioners.
In fact, two of the five single-member districts
that he created would have weighted — would have weighted
black populations of more than 55 percent, and the remaining
three districts would have weighted black populations of less
than 14 percent.
The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision accord­
ing to the Zimmer factors.

It said that the district court

had applied the proper standards, and that his findings
were not clearly erroneous, and it cited just one case, the
decision of a different panel of the Court of Appeals, in the
City of Mobile’s case.
Now a good deal of argument has gone on about
exactly what the Court of Appeals thereby decided, and whether
in particular the Court of Appeals decided, and whether it is
necessary, to make out a violation of the equal protection
clause and of Fifteenth Amendment, to show purposeful
discrimination on the part of the State.
The correctness of that view, which I think clearly

76

is correct, that purposefulness is required, is contested.
So let me turn first, by way of analysis of that,
to a couple of points that I think cannot be contested.

One

is that no one has asserted, or even suggested, that the
at-large system here was conceived in racial animus, with a
deliberate purpose of discriminating against blacks, or
submerging the votes of blacks.
A second is that the district court made its
decision on the basis of an understanding that the Court of
Appeals' Zimmer factors capture the effects of an at-large
system on minority voters and candidates, not on the
understanding that those factors go to an intent to discrimi­
nate o
At that point we get into more contentious ground.
At one point in his opinion —— Mr. Justice Rehnquist referred
to the parallel point in his opinion in the City of Mobile’s
case

at one point in his opinion, removed from his Zimmer

analysis, Judge Pittman said that it was possible to perceive
a present purpose to dilute black votes based on legislative
inaction, based on the failure of the legislature to do
anything about this

at—large system that had been created so

many years before.
I can think that the person reading that passage,
at page 34a of the appendix in our case, will agree that this
is no rinding, no finding of a present purpose oto discriminate,

77
even though that's how the plaintiffs now like to describe it.
It's in a section entitled conclusions of law.
preceded by any factual analysis.

It’s not

It's exactly the same

lanauage that's used in the different — factually different
City of Mobile case.

It simply, I think, fairly cannot be

considered a finding to which any deference is owed.

QUESTION:

But arguably the other case is more like

MR. ALLEN:

Well, it may — I’m just not that well

versed in the legislative goings on in the other case to know
that.

But I did not mean to imply that in what I said in

comparing the two.
The -- I was at the point where we were talking about
whether a present purpose to discriminate was found here.
And in its opinion, in the City of Mobile’s case, which was
cited in this case as decisional authority, the Court of
Appeals was more specific.

80

It said, in that case, that when ycm8ve aggregated
these Zimmer factors, and they add up to voting dilution, then
at least when the dilution is long-standing, there is — the
requisite intent if the legislative body has not acted to
change the situation.

That is substantially the reasoning

of the Court of Appeals, if I understand them.
But that sort of intent, I submit, is a construct?
it's artificial.

Zimmer factors themselves are enough if the system of at-large
elections is old enough to permit —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Schnapper?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES IN NO. 78-357
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
These two cases raise a variety of different issues,
and I thought it might be useful to briefly sketch out what
they are.
First, there is a statutory claim in these cases,
which as the Chief Justice noted in the last argument,
ordinarily is a claim thatis resolved prior to decision on any
constitutional claims.
We allege that under Section 2 of the Voting Rights
Act, the at-large elections used in these cases violates
Section 2.

And we rely in particular on a statement by

Attorney General Katsenbach, which is quoted by this Court in
footnote 31 in Allen, which says that Section 2 covers
purpose or effect.

That it has — I would paraphrase that —

the same meaning that Section 5 does, but with a different
burden of proof.
<{

s

Second, there is a constitutional claim under

83

White against Regester.

Now, with regard to that, we are in

agreement with the government that we seek only to apply
decisions of this Court in White, and before and after it,
which I think are fairly well established.
We are in disagreement with the government, which
reads soma intent requirement into White.

We see not intent

requirement in White, and we set out at length in our briefs
why.
Third, we claim that in these cases the systems of
election are maintained because of a deliberate decision to
keep blacks from public office.

We maintain that the

hypothetical posed by Justice Stevens is in fact the case.
QUESTION:

Who?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

The state?

*

■

,

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, our answer would be slightly

different in the two cases.

I mean I — we would say the

state in the constitutional sense.

But I think itfs more

complex than that.
QUESTION:

Well, who was maintaining this

discrimination?
MR. SCENAPPER:

In the case, in the city case, the

as Mr. Justice Stevens, there's direct testimony by members
of legislature who were there at the time the decisions were

84

made not to authorise singla-member districts f that that
decision inwas made for racial reasons.

And they were made

essentially by the members of the legislature from Mobile;
that’s the way the legislature operates.
QUESTION:

And Mobile controls the legislature?

MR. SCKNAPPER:

Well, that seems to be the — an

important part of the analysis of the school board case.

It's

1

not critical to the analysis of the city case.
In the school board case, we have a rather
complicated series of facts which are set out in our brief
involving the introduction and passage of deliberately
defective legislation, in the legislature, in order to prevent
the federal litigation from going forward.
And we — that becomes, I think, the operative
decision.

And as a practical matter, those decisions were
\

made by the defendant school board members.
And it was their contention below, and I think
correctly, that they were calling the shots in the legislature
about what was being introduced and passed.
QUESTION:
isn’t it?

Of course, ultimately it’s the voters,

Except for this so-called bloc voting, there’s

nothing the legislature could do in the state capital, or
the city or the school board could do which could prevent
Negroes,being elected?
MR. SCHNAPPERs

Well, I don’t want to recount the

85

history of discriminatory devices that have existed in
Alabama over the years.
QUESTION:

But ultimately it’s the voters.

MR. SCHNAPPERs

But I think — I think this intentiona

scheme todiscriminat® on the part of the state wouldn’t work
if you didn’t also have bloc voting.
QUESTIONs

You have to, and that’s within the

voluntary control of each individual voter.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that

if we are right, and Mr. Justice Stevens’ hypothetical is
the case, namely, that this election system is being maintained
for the express purpose of keeping blacks from being elected,
the purpose on the part of the officials of the State of
Alabama, that that violates the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments of the constitution.
Nothing in the decisions of this Court suggest that
a motive to — a racial motive which is not benign in nature,
but here clearly vicious, can somehow or other be sanctioned
because it only works because of private discrimination as
well.
I think that it would be analogous to a situation
where, for example, the state — as happened in 1903 —
expressly authorized the state parties to exclude voters on
the basis of race? and fch© parties did that.

I mean it was—

there was action which was less state action than the actions

86

of the legislature, although it may be for constitutional
purposes, that was also state action or part of it.
But I don’t think that that part of the causal
mechanism is of any relevance.,

I think the state action from

a hostile racial motive, that violates the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments, and that would be the end of the case,
In addition —
QUESTION:

You then, I take it, relate the historic

hostile motive of what existed back in 1826 and 1836 to a
hostile motive today, because the legislature did not change
the structure to meet a different kind of discrimination?
MR, SCHNAPPER:
like Arlington Heights.

We have a situation here exactly
In Arlington Heights, there had been

a zoning classification, the Court’s opinion showath not
when in origin.

But a dispute arose as to the decision of

Arlington Heights not to change its zoning classification.
i

And the Court held -— and I think properly — that if
that refusal to change had been racially motivated, the zoning
would have been unconstitutional.

And it was ofno importance

whan or how that zoning classification had come into
existence.

And that’s our contention here.
We’d just ask you in that regard to follow Arlington

Haights.
QUESTION s
maintain your point?

How many legislators do you need to
A majority?

8?

MR* SCHNAPPER:

I think the question would be who

the people were who were actually making the decisions.
If the legislature effectively delegates control over this
to a single legislator, as indeed exists in Alabama —
QUESTION;

To one legislator?

MR* SCHNAPPER;

The way the system works is, a bill

of this sort — a bill affecting this situation, a bill affect­
ing only Mobile, would have to be approved by the legislative
delegation from Mobile.
And the courtesy rule in the Senate is that that —
that any single member of the State Senate can veto a Mobile
bill.

And that’s precisely what happened.

So it was one

Senator.
The question isn't one of numbers? the question is
who is making the decision on behalf of the state.
QUESTION;

So you can say that the whole legislature,

all Alabama, including Fred Gray, is guilty of racial prejudice?
is that right?
MR. SCHNAPPERs

Well, I wouldn’t characterize it in

that way.
QUESTION;
MR

Well, I wouldn't think you could.

SCHNAPPER:

But

the -- Your Honor, if the State

of Alabama, aac the legislature delegates the authority for
making the decis*

to on« ,

..toer of the legislature, and the

district court found that that was the case — and it’s not a

88

finding that was contested — then the motives of the person
that makes that decision is the operative motive for the State
of Alabama.

And I —

QUESTION s

And we8 re bound by that?

MR. SCHNAPPER:
QUESTION;

And I think you're bound by that.

In other words, when the legislature as a

whole, in your hypothetical — your explanation — delegated
that power to one man, they in advance adopted the action he
was taking, and the motives that motivated him?
MR. SCHNAPPER;

Well, they could have changed their

mind, but they didn't.
It seems to me no other conceivable rule is possible.
I mean, otherwise you could simply nullify the Fourteenth
Amendment by systematically referring any legislation that
you wanted to undertake with a discriminatory motive to a
single legislator who would then act from racial motives, and
then you come in to defend a suit and say, "Well, you know, it
was only Senator So-and-so, and the rest of us never even
thought about it.”
I mean, that would be just, I think, a rule that
would be an invitation to an evasion of theconstitut: ~al
commands in this area.
Finally, I was just trying to sketch out here what
the arguments were presented by the case, there is a claim
under the Fifteenth Amendment.

And as I think Mr. Turner

89
noted, that is somewhat narrower in its impact than our claim
under White against Regester, because of course it would be
limited to racial issues.
Both the government and we contend that the Fifteenth
Amendment is not limited to instances of discriminatory
purpose.

I think we have a somewhat different approach to it.
We rely particularly on the legislative history of

the Fifteenth Amendment, and the concern on the part of
Congress, by adopting the Fifteenth Amendment, to insure that
clacks were armed with an effective franchise by which they
could protect themselves against government discrimination.
We think the record shows clearly that they don5fc
have that in this case.
The government advances an argument I think closer
to that suggested by Mr. Justice White, to wit, that we have
something here akin to the Terry v. Adams, and as I think you
were articulating it, of a Democratic party has picked its
candidates on the basis of race, and has — and that decision
is effectively state action, because it controls the coutcome
of the elections.

Amendment prohibits the state from adopting election systems
which have a discriminatory effect.

And this, we claim, is

such a system.
That doctrine is somewhat different than the doctrine
we find in White against Regester for a variety of reasons,
not the least of which is that it is — White is limited to
the problem of at-large election systems.

The Fifteenth

Amendment would cover any particular — any election law.

But

on the other hand, the Fifteenth Amendment is limited to
questions of race.

With regard to the Fifteenth Amendment, we place
particular emphasis on the phrase — on the first use of the
phrase, 11 abridge" in the language of the Fifteenth Amendment.
If you will recall the history of the times when the
Fifteenth Amendment was adopted, there was nothing then to
which that could have corresponded.

The South was under the

control of the Union Army, and blacks were free to vote
everywhere.
The concern — I think we think that Congress, in

94
adding the word "abridged," was not merely that when the whites
came back into power after reconstruction, they would strip
blacks of the right to vote at all, but that new forms of
discrimination, new devices might be adopted that had these
kinds of impacts,
I know, Justice White, that there was I think an
understandable concern in Washington against Davis

about the

ramifications of having an effect rule under the Fourteenth
Amendment.

Because it would call into question a wide variety

of governmental programs;

Housing, taxes, and all sorts of

things o
We think those problems aren't raised by the effect
rule w® urge under the Fifteenth Amendment.

It's our —

obviously, its scope would be limited to claims of discrimi­
nation in voting.

And we think it appropriate that voting —

that blacks be protected in voting to a greater degree than
others.
QUESTION;

You say the state is sufficiently involved

if it maintains a system which permits individual discrimination
at thepolls?
MR. SCHNAppeh:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, that's right.

That's it, isn't it?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That is it.

That is it.

The role of

the state is in creating and maintaining the at-large system.
Now, I'd like to turn at this point ~ well, there's

95

one other point which I think does separate us from the
appellants in both these cases.
I think we have a very different view of what the
role of the appellate courts are in resolving these cases.
I think it — I --- listening to their argument, I had the
sense that we were back in the trial court, and you were
sitting nisi prius, or perhaps riding circuit, as occurred in
the old days.
I think as Justice Stevens pointed out that the role
of the Court is more limited? that absent some sort of
palpable error, which I don't think is present hare, the
findings of the trial court really do have to be accepted.
And in our view, they're sufficient to mandate
judgment for us.
QUESTION:

What if we concluded that the trial court

did not find that there was an intent to discriminate, and that
the Court of Appeals concluded that there was an intent to
discriminate?
Now, is that a two-court finding that we ought to
affirm?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

If you hold — let me make sure I've

got this right -- that the district court didn't find intent —■
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SHCNAPPER:
find intent?

— but that the Court of Appeals did

96

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I don't ~~ well, that's not under the

two-court rule.
I think, in all candor, that the practice of the
Court in that situation — is to come very close to putting
itself in the shoes ofthe Court of Appeals.
QUESTION;

So I don’t think ~~

There is a problem —*

MR. SCHNAPPER:

— the same deference would exist if

it were merely a Court of Appeals finding of intent.
QUESTION;

There is a problem here in what standards

are applied, isn't there?

Because Washington against Davis

came down after this litigation had started.

And as I

understand it, the Nevett foursome, or whatever it was,
was decided at an intermediate stage of this litigation, so
that you have a little bit of a shifting of legal standards.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Washington against Davis was

decided before the cases went to trial.

And so at the time

the cases went to trial, there was already a dispute between
the parties as towhether you needed intent under the Fourteenth
Amendment.
We maintain there, as we do know, that the equal
protection clause has two distinct branches.
QUESTION;

I had thought the litigation was eight

or nine years old?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

No, surprisingly enough, this case

97

is only four years old*
QUESTION:

Bearing in mind —

[Laughter.]
QUESTION:- — that this is a direct appeal, what is
it that we are limited from changing under your concept of
the two-court rule?
MR» SCHNAPPER:

Well, I think the ordinary practice

of the Court —
QUESTION:

Well, isn't the first thing we have to

pass on the constitutionality; the first thing we have to pass
on on a direct appeal, don't we?

And certainly we don't have

to follow the two-court rule on constitutionality, do we?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, that's several questions.

Let

me try to answer them all .
QUESTION:

I mean, don't put us out of business.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

First, I think that the first question

you probably ought to reach, consistent with the general
practice of the court, would be the statutory issue.

And I

say that not because we prefer to win on one theory or
another —
QUESTION:

This is a direct appeal.

MR, SCHNAPPER:

It is a direct appeal.

But I

think that what's normal —
QUESTION:

And what is before us on a direct appeal?

The constitutionalitv of a statute.

98

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, X think we are entitled, as we

are in any case, to urge, in support of the decision below,
any ground that was raised below.
QUESTION:

Oh, sure, but X don't think you —

MR. SCHNAPPER:

And the statutory ground was raised

below.
QUESTIONS

X don't think you had the right to pre­

vent us from considering the constitutionality of the statute
that's involved.
MR. SCHNAPPER;

We have no right to do that, and no

intention of trying to do that.
QUESTION;

Well, I misunderstood you.

I'm sorry I

misunderstood you.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

X meant only to recall to you the

normal practise of the court, which is to decide statutory
issues first.
We have no preference on that.

If you want to

decide the most sweeping constitutional issues, then the
narrow constitutional issues, then the statutory issues ~
QUESTION;

As long as we decide for you?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's our position.

[Laughter.]
MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's our position.

But I think you had another question, I don't think
I fully answered it.

99

QUESTION:

On the two-court —

QUESTION:

If I did, I've forgotten it already.

MR. SCHNAPPER:
QUESTION;

Right.

I think —

Around the third corner, I forgot it.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

My — our position would be that

that two-court rule is as applicable here as always.

The

two-court rule does not preclude you from deciding
constitutional issues; it only suggests that with regard to
specific factual matters, that you generally uphold the
findings of the two courts below unless there's an unusual
circumstance.
QUESTION:

Unless they're wrong.

QUESTION:

Mr. Schnapper, can I ask you a question?

MR. SCHNAPPER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Your opponent, Mr. Allen, has said that

when you really analyze the facts, what the case boils down
to is bloc voting plus an at-large system plus a minority
of blacks in the voting population.
And in your brief you emphasize those very facts —
MR. SCHNAPPER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— in distinguishing other cases.

Do

you think those facts are enough?
MR. SCHNAPPER:
enough.

It is our contention they are indeed

And they are enough under

White against Regester,

under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and under the

100
Fifteenth Amendment, although for somewhat different reasons,
because the rationales of each one of those rules are
different.
With regard to that, I think perhaps I should
answer a question that Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked earlier
about Zimmer y. McKeithen.

The — both parties in the

Courts of Appeals relied on Zimmer v. McKeithen, and you
<■

will find in the brief for the school board, a statement which
says they think Zimmer v. McKeithen is correct.
I think we ware all obligated to act within the
context of Zimmer in the Courts of Appeal.

I think here it

is indeed argued that Simmer was too restricted in its
japplication of White against Stage.'3ter, and that —* that
lees proof is required than is elaborated in Zimmer.
And we also are in disagreement with the part of
Nevefct v. Sides, which was subsequent, which holds that
intent is in fact necessary under White or Zimmer, and we *ve
laid out the reasons for that contention in our brief.
Your Honor, I'd like to touch very briefly on our
claim under the Voting Rights Act, v/hich we think is the
issue with which the Court ought to begin.
We’ve noted that the legislative history on this
matter, such as it is, is quite clear; that Attorney General
Katzenbach testified on the very issue of whether or not
the statute covered purpose and effect, and said that it did.

101

Fe think, therefore, that the substantive standard
under the Voting Rights Act — under Section 2 — is exactly
the same as the substantive standard under Section 5.

Which,

is to say that if theelection law permits white voters to
nullify the electoral preferences of blacks, that it rails
under the Voting

Rights Act.,

The difference — the only difference that we see
between Section '5 and Section 2 is procedural, that the
burden of proof is on the state under Section 5; the burden
of proof is on the plaintiff under Section 2.
QUESTION:

Well, your opponent cites Senator

Dirksen’s statement that Section 2 is just a restatement of
the Fifteenth Amendment.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, I think it's almost.

I think

the word "almost" appears in there,
I think that -— that the value of that is a little
hard to know.

Because I think nobody at that point necessarily

knew what the Fifteenth Amendment meant.
QUESTION:

But Attorney General Katzenbach did.

MR, SCHNAPPER:

And he said purpose or affect.

He

was quite clear about that.
QUESTION:

Who passes laws, the Attorney General

or the Congress?
MR. SCHNAPPER:
QUESTION:

Current wisdom is the Congress does.

The theory.

102
QUESTION:

But not a single Senator.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Not in this Senate.

Not in this

Senate.
If we’re right in our contention that the standard
under Section 2 and Section 5 are the same, then I think the
result of the case will be clear.
I think if Alabama had attempted to switch to this
system from a single-member system, there'd be no question
tha\ they couldn't do it, and we think Section 2 invalidates
it for that reason.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:16 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
