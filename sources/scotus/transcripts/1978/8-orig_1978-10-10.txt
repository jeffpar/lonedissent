MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No» 8 Original, Arizona against California»
You may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr» Noble»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS B. NOBLE, ESO»,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS ET AL»
MR» NOBLE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Before beginning, I would like to clarify the Court's
hearing list»

I am here today speaking on behalf of all ten

of the state parties, the three states of Arizona, California,
and Nevada and also the seven California defendants as to two
of the three matters before the Court—-the Joint Motion for
Entry of a proposed Supplemental Decree filed by the ten parties
and the United States on May 26, 1978, and also as to the....
Intervention Motion of the Chemehuevi, the Fort Mojave, and
Quechan Indian Tribes, which I will henceforth refer to as the
Fort Mojave Motion for the sake of convenience»
As to the third matter before the Court, the
Intervention Motion of the Cocopah and the Colorado River
Indian Tribes» 1 will speak only for the four parties desi'r.rCcd
in the Court's hearing list,

Mr. Will will speak for the four

parties designated next to his name»

And Mr. Hunsaker will

follow on behalf of not only the State of Arizona but also the
Palo Verde Irrigation District of California.

5
I would just like to briefly go into the background
of this ease.
before»

I know it has certainly been before this Court

The suit in this matter was initiated by the State of

California, invoking this Court's original jurisdiction, in
1352.

They named California and seven California agencies

using Colorado River water as defendants»
The purpose of the suit was to seek an adjudication
of the relative rights of the States of Arizona and California
in the lower mainstream of the Colorado River»
Subsequent to the filing of the complaint in the
Court, the United States and the State of Nevada were allowed

t

to intervene on their own motions; and the States of New Mexico
and Utah were joined at the request of California,
A trial was held before a special master appointed
by this Court,

He made his findings and a report available to

the Court, with a proposed decree.

And following two different

sessions of oral argument, the Court issued its opinion in
this matter in 1963 and a decree implementing that opinion in
1964»
The present proceedings before this Court all consti™
tut© further business under three different articles of that
1964 decree™-Article II, Article VI, and Article IX,
The present series of pleadings was initiated by the
ten state parties that I speak for on May 2, 1977, when we filed,
a joint motion for entry of a supplemental decree listing

present perfected rights under the Court9s mandate in Article
VI of the decree.

That was done pursuant.to language in

Article VI, which authorises any party to petition to the Court
in the event that the parties and the Secretary of the Interior
are unable to reach agreement on the present perfected rights
list mandated by the Court under Article VI.
Subsequent to the filing of that petition, which was
done because agreement could not be reached, the ten state
parties and the United States did reach agreement not only on
present perfected rights lists but on a proposed supplemental
decree, including those lists and including language demanded
by the United States to protect the five lower Colorado River
Indian tribes on whose behalf the United States originally
intervened in the case, among others.
Despite the fact that this language was inserted in
the proposed supplemental decree to protect the five tribes,
three of the tribes-—which I have designated the Fort Mojave
Motion—have intervened, attacking that proposed supplemental
decree, claiming that it is prejudicial to them and also
asserting additional present perfected rights over and above
those quantified by this Court, for those reservations in its
1964 decree.

At the same time the other two ‘tribes along the

lower Colorado, which I designated the Cocopah Motion, have
intervened, urging the Court to enter the proposed supplemental
decree but also seeking intervention for purpose of asserting

7
additional present perfected rights.
Therefore, there are two basic questions I think
initially before this Court®

First of all, is the proposed

supplemental decree fair to all five Indian tribes, and should
it be entered by this Court at this time?
We believe that the answer to both of these ques­
tions is a resounding yes, and this is the answer not only of
the ten state parties but also of the United States and two of
the five tribes, including, 1 might add, the Colorado River
Indian Tribes, which hold by far the majority of all the
Indian rights along the lower Colorado River®
Looking at these questions one by one, Is the decree
fair?

There are three major provisions of the decree which we

believe are designed and have the effect of protecting the
Indian tribes' interests under the decree and, in fact,
conferring benefits upon them.
First of all, there is subordination language under
i

which all major non-federal present perfected rights are
subordinated to all Indian present perfected rights presently
decreed in the '64 decree, and any additional Indian present
perfected rights that may be decreed in the future as a result
of recognition of enlarged reservation boundaries.
Q

That takes care, however, o£ only on® part of

the Indians' claims to greater reservations of water, does it
not?

One was the effect of new boundaries, and the other was

8

the affect of a mistake stemming from failure of sealous
representation by the United States or from whatever cause in
the original allocation of irrigable acreage? is that not right?
MR. NOBLE:

That is true# Your Honor.

We have

excluded these from the subordination agreement because we
have taken the position that recalculation of irrigable acreage
for the lands that existed in the reservations, that were
recognised as reservation lands in 1964, is barred by res
judicata because the Indians were adequately represented and
because the issues were fully litigated at that time.
We also feel that these claims are basically limitless
claims.

1 think the various submissions we have here have so

many different figures and such huge claims that we felt, we
simply could not subordinate to something like that.
I think perhaps a more important issue, though, is
that this proposed supplemental decree represents a compromise.
The fact that the Indian tribes represented by the United
States may not have gotten everything they conceivably could
have wanted, out of this decree does not mean that the U„S, did
not adequately represent them or that this increase prejudices
them.
Q

They were allocated some 900,000 acre feet of

water per annum, were they not?
MR. NOBLEs

That is approximately correct, Your

Honor, slightly over 900,000.

9
Q

Acre feet8

MR. NOBLE %

Yes.

Of the additional amounts they claim# even under
Table C(l)f in the second Fort Mojave brief where they claimed
over 600#000# there is no way to determine# I do not believe#
how much of that is recalculation and now much of it relates
to boundary disputes»

I think maybe four or five hundred is

recalculation.
1 think if you will check those# almost all of
those asserted additional present perfected rights# pursuant to
recalculation# are for reservation with priority dates before
1900.

And# therefore# regardless of whether or not this is

included In the subordination agreement# these rights will be
satisfied ahead or almost all of the non-federal present
perfected rights.

I believe the figure is almost 93 percent

of the non-federal present perfected rights have priority
dates after 1900«
And# furthermore# Your Honor# there is really very
little chance at all# if any# that the full amount of present
perfected rights, even including the largest additional claim
asserted by the Fort Mojave Motion# there is very little
chance that this total could aver not be satisfied.

Figures

of the worst drought year on the river# combined with the
obligation of the upper basin and the amount of water that will
be available# plus the amount, available due to the storage

projacts # indicate that even in the worst year there will be
more than enough water to satisfy all the present perfected
rights# all the Indian rights# all the non-Indian rights# and ’
all the additional rights claimed in the Fort Mojave brief»
So# it is our contention that in no way does the proposed
supplemental decree prejudice the Indians.

The fact that the

subordination language does not include the additional claims#
these additional claims# does not render it prejudicial in any
way.

And it was a compromise reached after years of negotia­

tion with the United States.
In addition# Your Honor# there is a second point.
I said at the beginning there were three provisions in the
proposed supplemental decree to protect and benefit the Indian
tribes.

The second one# in addition to the subordination

language# is a provision that allows the Indians unrestricted
use of their water»

Let me rephrase that.

Indians to put their water to any use.

It allows the

It does not limit them

to agriculture even though the measure of the right is agri­
cultural use.
Q

And its justification.

MR. NOBLE?

Yes# that is true.

But we have conceded,

at the request of the United States# to allow the Indian tribes
•fco put their water to other use as long as the total amount of
water consumed from the river does not exceed what it would have
been had it been put to agricultural use»

As far as we know#

this is a right that has not yet been recognised by any court.
So, we feel it is a major concession.
Finally and—
Q

The other possible uses are in raining, for

example?
MR. NOBLEs
use.

Mining, industrial, perhaps a municipal

The Indians—
Q

The municipal would hardly use any of it.

MR. NOBLEs

That is true.

The Indians might rent

some of the land on the reservation to companies that could
put the water to other use.
Thirdly, the third point in the proposed supplemental
decree to protect the Indians is the provision that explicitly
reaffirms the validity of Articles 11(D)(5) and (9) which, it
is our contention, are the articles this Court designed to
handle the assertion of any additional Indian water rights
claimso

There is, therefore, no prejudice to the assertion of

additional claims by the proposed supplemental decree.
Q

May I just go back a minute?

The amount of

water the Indians can take out of the water and use for nonagricultural uses, does that include water that they could just
sell?

Or do they have to use it?
MR. NOBLEs

The water would have to ba used on the

reservations, whether it is used by Indians or non-Indians.

Q

But it has to be used on that land.

12
MR, NOBLE;

Yes, that is true,

There is no provision

in that language that allows them to transport it or to sell it,
Q

Not out of the water shed area,

MR, NOBLE;
Q

That is correct,

And you think selling the water on the reserva­

tion -to somebody else would not be using the water on the
reservation?

It would be using it very profitably, would it

not?
MR, NOBLE;

I beg your pardon. Your Honor,

I am not

sure that I understand you,
0
tion,

I was just following my Brother White's ques­

Is not selling the water on the reservation to somebody

else using the water very profitably on the reservation?
MR, NOBLE;

Yes, I think that is correct, and I

answered that that would be permitted under our language.

But

the language would not allow water to be used off the reserva­
tion,
Q

The water itself,

MR, NOBLE;

Yes* the water itself.

For instance, if

the Indians could rent the land and, say, a non-Indian farmer,
which has happened in a number of cases, could use that water

on his land, that would be tantamount to selling it for use oh
the reservation, I would think,
0

But they could not sell it to Los Angeles?

MR, NOBLE;

If Los Angeles chose to use it on the

13
reservation, I suppose they could.
Q

No, but they could not sell it for transporting

by pipeline or flown to Los Angeles.
MR. NOBLE:

No.

There is no provision in the language

that allows the water to be transported off the reservation.
It is therefore our contention that the proposed
supplemental decree in no way prejudices the Indian tribes.
They may still come in and assert their additional rights.
Q

We do have a category of miscellaneous rights

that are not subordinate to the Indian claims and percentagewise
it is not insignificant.
MR. NOBLE:
Q

Well, percentagewise, Your Honor-”

At least for one or two tribes it is not

insignificant.
MR. NOBLE:
Q

It is .56 percent.

What is the largest percentage figure for each

tribe if you look it up individually? do you know?
MR. NOBLE:

For each tribe?
:

Q

What is your .56 percent; that is all tribes

together?
MR. NOBLE:

No? 99.44 percent of the non-federal

present perfected rights are major, by the definition in the
decree, and will be subordinated? .56 percent, which represents
17,504 acre-feet will not be subordinated.

Of this 17,504

acre-feet, most of them are junior to Indian claims anyway.

So, the Indians would take ahead regardless of the subordina­
tion agreement.
Of the others, as I answered to a previous question,
to Mr. Justice Stewart, there is almost no conceivable situa­
tion in which there will not be enough water to satisfy the
lowest Indian priority, which is the Cocopah, which, I might
add—
Q

The question was, Gan you make that same state­

ment you made a moment ago about Indians generally about each
tribe, the water rights of each tribe vis-a-vis these
miscellaneous rights?
MR. NOBLEs

I am not really sure I understand the

question.
0

You spoke about the Indians generally, but I

suppose each tribe has a different set of rights.
MR. NOBLE:
0

That is

true.

tod they have different priorities.

MR. NOBLE:

To answer your question, the lowest,

priority among the Indian tribes is the Cocopah Indian Tribe.
They have, I believe, 2,744 acre-feet, with a 1917 priority.
Q

Kow about them vis-a-vis the miscellaneous

rights?
MR. NOBLE:

Their percentage, vis-a-vis the

miscellaneous rights—they have about one-eighth of the total
of the miscellaneous rights.

But our calculations have shown

15
that by the time you get to the Coeopahs, even if you were to
satisfy all of the non-federal rights ahead of the Coeopahs,
you would still have about two million acre-feet left under
the worst conditions»
And I might further point out, Your Honor, that the
Coeopahs themselves are urging the implementation of this
decree.
Q

1 understand that.

MR. NOBLE;
all the tribes.
G

t

I understand that.

They would be in the worst position of

I have not calculated—
What is the justification for not subordinating

some rights to the Indian rights?
MR. NOBLE;

The justification was more a practical

one, I would say, than anything else.

First of all, we are

dealing with—I do not know the exact number of miscellaneous
claimants.

It is 50 or 60, maybe it is more, individual people,

many of whom only have one acre-foot of right.

The logistical

problem of getting them all to consent to the subordination
agreement was so insurmountable that in our negotiations with
the United States on this we simply agreed that it was not
feasible and that it would not prejudice the Indian tribes
anyway.
Q

Were there any cities involved in that?

MR. NOBLE;
Q

Yes, there were, the cities of—■

It would not be too hard to get their consent,

would it?
MR, NOBLE %
well might be,

I do not know, Your Honor,

I think it

A lot of these people out there have been

waiting 15 years for these rights, and we do not understand
why they have not gotten them»

And I have no way of knowing

that.
We have also taken the position that a decree should
foe entered in this case, and it should be entered in order to
end the chance for disagreements in the future, to give the
holders of non-Indian present perfected rights the same court
recognition of their right that the federal present perfected
rights holders have.
Furthermore, we feel that the decree should be
entered now because of the fact that the parties have waited
so long—not just the parties but also the claimants, and the
fact that- a lot of the small claimants are technically illegal
diverters from the river until such time as they have a contract
with the Secretary of the Interior for the water, pursuant to
the Court's decree.

And they are unable to get contracts,

they are unable to get loans, to develop their land until they
have an assured water right.
Q

Mr» Noble, in response to Justice White's

earlier question about why some rights were not subordinated
to the Indian rights, I take it there was some give and take
in negotiating this decree, that there was nothing in the

original decree that would have mandated subordination of any
of the rights that are now being subordinated.
MR. NOBLE:

Nothing at all. Your Honor.

This was a

concession that the states made in order to try to wrap up this
matter.

It was done after long periods of compromise.

And,

as I have said in answer to Justice Stewart’s question before,
this is a compromise,, and I think you have to judge the
adequacy of the representation of the United States on behalf
of the Indian tribes on the basis of the fact that compromises
were made
^

„

as they are in any legal proceeding.
I think furthermore that when we look at this , we

have to consider that the proceedings under Article VI# as far
as the United States is concerned,, are basically ended.

So,

we have to look at the past representation of the United States.
The United States has now joined us in proposing a decree.

It

is not a q’uestion of whether there is now a speculative
possibility that the United States will not be able to represent the Indians adequately in the future.

The fact is that

they have represented them adequately in the past,
I have a good deal more argument on intervention.
do not want to take Mr. Will's time.

I

But I will simply say

that as to the intervention question, our position on behalf of
all ten state parties as to the Port Mojave Motion is that we
believe it should be denied simply because it doss seek not
only to assert additional present perfected rights but also to

18

attack and destroy the proposed supplemental decree, which
we feel is fair to the Indian tribes and should be entered now»
As to the Cocopah motion, four of us that I speak for
have taken a different position because we feel this motion is
aiade under the proper articles of the decree»
prejudice the states»

It does not

And if there are certain conditions

attached to the grant of intervention, pursuant to the consent
of the three states, then we feel that the rules under Federal
Rule 24, which we feel the Court should use as a guide to
judge intervention, we feel that the requirements for permissive
intervention will be met»
Q

You agree with the United States then on the

intervention?
MR. NOBLE:
that.

Yes, we do.

Let me make one exception to

We have put in one condition.

United States agrees on this.

I am not sure if the

Ws believe that if intervention

is allowed, then only one voice should be allowed to speak for
the, Indians in—
Q

1 guess the United States would consent to the

intervention of the tribes with respect to future rights, even
the three tribes?
MR. NOBLE: Yes.
G

But you would not?

MR. NOBLE:

We would, Your Honor.

If the three

tribes made the same motion that the Cocopahs and the Colorados

19
made, we would treat them the same.
the three tribes»

We have

no animus against

tod if this Court were to consider their

motion to be such, we would take the same positions we have
taken vis-a-vis the two tribes»
Q

And you waive the Eleventh Amendment rights of

your four clients, if any, to the extent of the conditions to
which you agree? is that it?
MR, NOBLE:

I waive the Eleventh Amendment rights

of the States of California and Nevada as to intervention under
those conditions»
Q

So long as those conditions are met»

MR, NOBLE:

As long as those conditions are met and

subject to the reservation.

We do not concede in this case ■

that intervention would be as a matter of right due to inade­
quate representation.

But if intervention is proper, even in

the presence of adequate representation, we would consent
because we feel the conditions can make the intervention such
that it will not cause undue delay and prejudice of the lawsuit.
It is timely under these articles, under 11(D)(5) and (9).
Q

11(D)(5) and (9).

MR. NOBLE;

Yes.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER.

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT P» WILL,, ESQ»*
ON BEHALF OF THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT
OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ET AL.
MR. WILL?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court?
The Metropolitan Water District is responsible for
providing a major portion of the water supply for the urban
area of Southern California, which includes some 11 million
people.

The future water supply for that area is undoubtedly

going to rest entirely upon our efforts to secure a water
supply from sources outside that area as our local resources
are exhausted at this time.
Approximately 60 percent of our present water supply,
or 1.2 million acre-feet, is delivered from the Colorado River
today.

That amount will decrease to somewhat less than 550,000

acre-feet of water when Arizona is expected to begin using its
full entitlement following completion of the Central Arizona
Project.

That is anticipated to occur in approximately 1985.
The assertion of the various tribal briefs that they

raay be entitled to as much as 600,000 additional acre-feet of
water of diversions which, by calculation is roughly 237,000
acre-feet of consumptive use, would represent 20 percent of our
present Colorado River supply and, in 1985, perhaps as much as
60 percent of that total water supply from the river.
To give you a perspective of what 237,000 acre-feet

of water would do in an urban area, a population of roughly a
million and a quarter people in that area could subsist upon
that o
As the allocation of the Metropolitan Water District,
from the Colorado is junior to the California agricultural uses?
the burden of any additional allocations to the tribes would
undoubtedly fall upon our agency®
The tribes, with respect to the allocations of \tfafcer,
make essentially two claimsi

One with respect to existing

rights that involve their present reservation boundaries and
those with respect to disputed lands.
With respect to those lands that are in dispute,
several boundary disputes were before the special master in
this case in its early stages.

They were fully tried and

adjudicated at that time and presented to this Court.

This

Court decided at that time that, they were apparently not right
for a decision.

Since that time, however, a number of other

boundary disputes on other reservation lands have appeared, and
we are now faced with a variety of new claims with respect to
these boundaries.
As we at Metropolitan have attempted to identify the
various boundary disputes, we now appear to be faced with a
multiplicity of administrative and judicial actions that assert
for the tribes a final determination as to the disputed lands
which they take the position are conclusive as far as the tribal

water rights are concerned.

As most of these actions were

initiated by the United States, either in the form of secre­
tarial orders or actions in District Court for trespass,
ejectment, or quiet title, we feel that it has been almost
impossible for us to learn without some kind of approach from
the Federal Government that puts us on notice as to the various
types of actions they are taking to settle the boundary
disputes.

This is the reason that in our brief we therefore

requested this Court to appoint a special master for the purpose
of once again settling these boundary disputes with respect to
the allocation of waters from the river™-not to try land titles
but, for the purposes of this decree, to identify those lands
which are entitled for water rights.
Q

Do you think that the United States disagrees

with you on this?

They seem to think that they have not made

up their mind about some things.

But eventually, do they say

or do they not say, that they would oppose the appointment of a
special master for this purpose?
MR. WILLs

It is my understanding that they would

oppose the appointment of a special master, but I would have to
let -the Solicitor’s Office respond directly to that.
Q

This would be In implementation or effectuation

of II CD) (5) ?
MR. WILL:
Q

Yes, under the provisions there.

However—

11(D)(5), as I remember it, refers specifically

23
only to the Fort Mojave Reservation and the Colorado River
Re servation-MR. WILLs
Q

That is correct»

•“-disputes involving the boundaries of those two

reservations, which were known to the Court in the early 1960s»
Perhaps it was because these other boundary disputes were not
exposed or known to the Court that 11(D)(5) is limited to only
those two reservations»

Do you think it could be understood

to foe generic?
MR. WILL?

I think it could either foe that or this

Court could act under Article IX of the decree, which permits
it of course to take any other action with respect to—

Q

Yes, it is kind of open-ended,

MR, WILLs

Yes.

We, of course, disagree that any of

these determinations are final.

And we believe that with

respect to those who have water rights along the river, with
secretarial orders or administrative actions are concerned,
that we are entitled to a hearing in some type of proceeding
where all of these matters can be brought to some type of
conclusion and the pre-1929 rights that are involved on this
river will be finally settled.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Will.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH E. HUNSAKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE COMPLAINANT ET AL.
MR® HUNSAKERs

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please
i

•the Court;
I am speaking today on behalf of the State of Arizona
and for the Palo Verde Irrigation District®

I would first

indicate to the Court that Arizona concurs and adopts the
position espoused by Mr. Noble in virtually all of it® aspects,
and we would urge strenuously today that the Court adopt the
stipulated supplemental decree®
In on© respect we do take a different position,

t

however, and that is-—and this may not even need be reached
by the Court in the event that the Court felt that intervention
was not proper®

Then this issue, I do not believe, would even

need be reached by the Court®

But we do feel that Arizona

cannot accede to the position taken by California and the others
spoken of by Mr® Noble that would indicate that they had waived
their Eleventh Amendment rights®

And so Anri zona would indicate

to this Court that it would not so waive those rights and-would
urge that those rights be protected fully®
In this respect, we are not unmindful of this Court's
decision in Moe v. Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes®
However, here we think that the tribes have already been
represented zealously by the United States®
their rights®,

They have asserted

And we believe that they have done so fully and

25
zealously.

In that respect then we would'

urge that the

matter continue as it has, with -the United States representing
those interests and presenting those interests.
Your Honor, with respect to the matter of intervention, we again would urge that there not he intervention
allowed in this matter by the tribes, and would urge that the
Court allow ‘the matter continue, with the Indians being
represented by the United States.
In respect to the matter of the disputes over
boundaries and those items, Arizona would urge that this
litigation was commenced as water litigation and that when we
begin to talk about boundary disputes, those are land matters.
And we would urge that those issues should properly be taken
up before

district courts who can rule on those disputes.

And then at such time as those become final, the matter can be
brought back to this Court under Article 11(D)(5) where
appropriate or under Article IX where appropriate and any
additional water rights which may pertain to those lands that

are finally determined to be within Indian boundaries can be
determined by this Court, pursuant to those articles of the
decree that would allow that determination.
That would conclude the position as to the State of
Arizona and the Palo Verde Irrigation District.
Q

So, you do not think there are any other issues

for a special master to deal with in this case?

26

MR. HUNSAKER;

Your Honor? we would again urge that

no. there are not, that these matters can be taken care of? and
the judicial procedure is set up in the district courts to take
care of those matters»

And we urge that that is the proper

place for those to be taken care of-

Then at the appropriate

time the matter could be brought back before this Court under
the two articles mentioned»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS

Very well,

Mr. Simpson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND C. SIMPSON? ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FORT MOJAVE INDIAN TRIBE ET AL.
MR. SIMPSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I apparently am the first speaker to address the
Court today with a contrary viewpoint.

I would like very

briefly to indicate that at the outset? when we were told that
we had 20 minutes in which to deal with this particular subject
which has covered so many years? I could only think of the old
statement of Henry Ward Beecher that no soul was ever saved
after the first 20 minutes? and concluded that I would do my
bast to equal what he had done.
In this particular case? on behalf of the Indians
that I represent? I would state to this Court that there are
two things that we have emphasized in our brief.

The first one

was that we called for intervention? which I respectfully

27
suggest to the Court possibly was a semantic error.

As you

have heard from other counsel, most people here do not seem to
disagree with the idea of the Indians having independent
counsel.

We have had soma disagreement.

I respectfully

suggest to the Court that possibly the Indians became parties
when the United States actually in its original petition
petitioned to intervene on behalf of the Indians as trustees
for the Indians, so that certainly the other parties would not
be prejudiced if we had what might ba described as a substi­
tution of counsel for the purpose of asserting the claims by
the Indians.
But we have had some things which I think are
particularly important with respect to the entry of the
supplemental decree, which is the primary thing with which we
are concerned.

Mr. Noble has explained that some background

was necessary in order to permit the Court to understand that
this truly was a fair proposal.

May I respectfully share a

little bit of background regarding this with the Court, which I
consider to be critical?
I would take the Court back to the year 1970.

At

that time, if Your Honors please, I was representing five
Indian tribes on the lower Colorado River, known as the
Confederated Tribes.

We were asked to come to Washington

because we were told that the decree of this Court back in
1964 had said the government and the states had an obligation

28
to establish present perfected rights under Article VI and that
they had two years to do it*,

As we know, sometimes attorneys

do have a habit of getting extremely busy, and they seek more
time»

And through the kindness of this Court it stretched from

1966 up till 1970.

In 1970 a stipulation had been worked out.

The stipulation provided in substance, I submit to this Court,
exactly what the supplemental decree today provides.

The

Indians were told at that time that the United States Government
desired their concurrence.

The Indians asked the question,

"What about certain lands to which title has been established?'
What about the type of examinations presented to the master
in the original concept?

We are advised by you, ‘the Bureau of

Indian Affairs, that in appropriate soil studies, if land
classifications were actually undertaken, this would result in
an entitlement of more water than has been mentioned so far.
We ask the articles to speak to this.

W® do not like to buy a

pig in a poke.
S,W© feel vary strongly that with the passage of six
years““in fact, preparation should have taken place in the
fifties so that this Court could have had all the actual facts.
We would like to ask only one thing.
We do not want something as a gift.

We do not want a handout.
But we do strongly seek

that which we believe we are entitled to under the decree of
this Court." Because of that reason, it was difficult t© obtain
consent to the stipulation.

29
Many maneuvers took place.

Eventually a meeting in

1975 took place with the Solicitor, with the Department of the
Interior, with representatives of the states who are here
today, and the irrigation districts,

hnd at that meeting

speeches were made regarding why the stipulation should be
adopted.
Whan this whole thing was concluded, the primary
thing that was asked, by way of a question by me to those
present, wass

"Gentlemen, all of you have said on© thing.

have said that this river has plenty of water.

You

There is no

shortage.

There will be no problem.

Therefore, I propose one.

If you do

not believe there is any shortage of water as a

problem, then it should not make any difference to you where
the priorities are established.

You should be willing to agree

that the Indians should come first.
Will you agree?"

Sc, there is no shortage.

They would not.

In the proposed stipulation they ultimately found
that this would not be sold to the Indians.

So, they went

together and came up with the proposed supplemental decree.
We oppose the supplemental decree for reasons already advanced.
But we go a bit further.

We oppose it, I would say to this

Court, first because it includes false facts.

Let me be

specific.
I refer, for example, to the response of the United
States.

In their response they pointed out that in working

30

out the supplemental decree—
Q

Do you want to give us the citation?

is the response?

What date

Which response? the June 9th one or not?

MR. SIMPSON:

November, 1977, the response of the

United States to the joint motion for determining the present
perfected rights—
Q

What page?

MR. SIMPSONs

This is on page 6.

The exact language

referred to there states that if the amendments proposed above
are not made—thus the agreement satisfactory to the United
States is reached, the United States is entitled to require a
showing of the proofs that support the claims to which it
gave tentative approval as part of an overall settlement.
Mr. Noble has emphasised that this is a settlement.
There is compromise.

The feeling of the tribes is that the

United States, in its capacity as a trustee, should have over
this very long period of time, have undertaken to determine
what type of land is there, what type of soil classification.
What water or quantity of water are the Indians entitled to?
They do not ask you to give them something to which
they are not entitled.

But, secondly, they ask more.

When you

set up the priority dates—
Q

Mr. Simpson.

MR. SIMPSON:
Q

Yes.

I want to be sure I follow your argument.

I

understood you to say, when you were responding to Mr» Justice
White, that you were going to call our attention to language
in this document that was a false fact»
MR. SIMPSONs

Have you done that?

No, 1 believe I perhaps misstated

myself if I stated that, Your Honor»

What 1 meant to state

was that we oppose the supplemental decree because it is
predicated upon false facts which have never been established
as a true statement»

And what 1 was referring to

in the

reference is that the proof of the priority dates set out in
the supplemental decree is something which has never been
supplied by the states and which even the Federal Government in
itrs response says, "We have worked out a compromise»

We

would have requested proof, which they had not done but as
trustee we say they should have done." And so we say that when
you take Palo Verde Irrigation District­
ed

But they said they would have required proof if

they had not reached agreement.
MR. SIMPSONi
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

And they did reach agreement.

So, the require™

ment of proof was—there was no need for a hearing then.
MR. SIMPSONs

Your Honor, if I may respectfully

express why I think there is, if you are a trustee and you ara
representing the Indians, and the Indians do not want priority
dates which come before their entitlement, and other people
engaged in litigation will stipulate to dates which bring them

before that, if they will stipulate to a date that the Indians
do not believe is adequate, it is our contention that you as
trustee would be obligated as a matter of law not to stipulate
away a priority date of this particular type.

This

is where

we feel that the United States as trustee has been deficient.
But, more importantly, we feel it is why the supplemental
decree cannot be entered because the amount of water that is
given to the irrigation districts, if they can prove they are
entitled to it—which we do not believe they are-then the date
would be perfectly all right.
We do not feel that something as vital as water in
the Southwest can be stipulated away by a date that gives the
people claiming it a date earlier than the Indian date.
Q

That is only true with respect to the miscei- -

laneous rights, is it not?
MR. SIMPSON:

That is not my understanding, Tour

Honor. What I am suggesting is take Palo Verde—
Q

I thought all presently perfected rights,

except a small category, were subordinate to the Indian claims.
MR. SIMPSON:
specifically.

I might comment on that, Your Honor,

The language purports to say that in the event

of a shortage, all of these rights to which you have alluded
would be subordinated to the Indian claims.
0

Except that small category.

MR. SIMPSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

I am suggesting that

this is specious and that the language is dangerous because?
one, 1 do not believe that the Indians should be subordinate
to begin with, which they are under this, because the proof of
the correctness of the other entities and th©ir priority dates
have never been submitted.
Secondly, I am suggesting that it is predicated
upon the requirements that the Indians would have to prove
that there was a shortage when in fact there is a shortage now,
And, thirdly, I am suggesting that if they are going to be so
kind to the Indians as to say, "You will never suffer,” then
why not simply say by stipulation, rather than that they will
have -to prove this, say, ?,You will come first”?—because if
there is plenty of water, there is no problem»

If there is a

shortage, then they have a priority»
The impact of the subordination agreement, in my
judgment, places an unfair burden upon the Indians.

And, most

of all, it requires that this Court put its stamp of approval
on an agreement purporting to set forth facts as to entitlement
which do not conform to the decree of this Court.
Q

From the original decree, Mr. Simpson, the

question of subordination was left open, was it not, as between
the states and the Indians?
MR. SIMPSOM;

You are completely correct, Justice

Rehnquisfc.

Q

So that the government in effect gained a victory

34
for the Indians by persuading the states to agree to subordinate
what I understand to be the very major portion of the water
claims to the Indian rights»
MR, SIMPSON:
language,

This would appear to be from the

I suggest it is not a major victory»

why is that if I

And my reason

represent a client and I believe that my

client has a priority date that, using a. figure, would be, say,
1900j and if you come along and you tell me no,

your client

is going to have a date that is going to be 1890, when I believe
your client's priority date is really, say, 1910, you say,
"Well, do not worry.

You agree that mine will be 1890»

And

then if you ever get in trouble, come in and prove that there
is a shortage, and I will subosrdinate mine to you»"

I believe

that the premise is false»
Q

So, you are suggesting that the priority dates

for present perfected rights--priority dates that have been
assigned or have been agreed upon—are inaccurate?
MR. SIMPSON:
Q

I definitely am suggesting that»

And have all the presently perfected rights been

assigned priority dates?
MR» SIMPSON:

Most of them, Your Honor, except those

involved in omitted lands or some of the abandoned lands.
Q

Yes, but the ones that have been identified have

been assigned priority dates?
MR. SIMPSON:

That is correct.

35
Q

And yon say that some of those—-many more of them

than just these miscellaneous rights—have priority dates prior
to the Indians?
MR. SIMPSON:

That is correct» Your Honor.

The

Indian dates under the decree of this Court commence with the
date establishing the reservation.

That is their priority

date.
Q

Why would anybody agree to subordinate rights

like that to Indian rights then?

Why did the states ever

turn around and say» "We have got earlier priority dates than
these Indian rights» but we are just going to subordinate
them"?
MR. SIMPSONs
Q

They did not want to litigate.

MR. SIMPSONs
litigate.

The answer» Your Honor, is twofold.

First of all» they did not want to

That is right.

Secondly» they did not want to have

a hearing where the fallacious nature of the priority dates
they had assigned to themselves had been set out.

And» thirdly»

I feel that the fact, that the Indians» because of various
reasons that I cannot go into

in great detail» have not had

these lands added created a fear.
For example» to be specific» I think of a case
regarding the Fort Mojaves because I believe it was Mr. Noble
who referred to the fact that some of these orders by the
Secretary and some of the boundary disputes that have been

settled

do not become final*

In the case of Mojave v.

LaFollefcte, which is one where I was counsel, which went to
judgment, the United States District Court

for Phoenix found

that approximately 1,300 acres of land in that instance had
belonged to the Fort Mojave Tribe and that there were accre­
tions to it and it still belonged to the Fort Mojave Tribe*
They have not been included*

But this particular land I am

talking about under present perfected rights would in fact be
land that would go to the date that the tribe actually had the
reservation established*

And this data would be later than

the date that has been agreed upon by the irrigation district
without, as the government says, proving that they were
entitled to those dates*

This is the reason we feel so

strongly about it and why we feel that the relief that is
requested of this Court is simply to establish a hearing*

They have

The Indians only want what the facts would show*

They

believe that this could be done within a reasonable time frame,
and that is why they opposed the entry of the decree.
Q

Suppose the government had not stipulated, had

not made this compromise or this agreement and said that we
just cannot agree0

Then X suppose that this original action

would be reopened, and there would be further proceedings in
this original action with the appointment of a special master
to hold the hearings and to recommend decision? is that right?
MR. SIMPSONs

how busy you are.

But X do feel that this is something you

decreed in 1964 that has not been done yet.

Their position strongly is that they

want the water that permits them to develop their lands, their
reservation, to the highest and best economic use possible.

to obtain without some type of independent representation.
Q

You have not mentioned paragraphs two and three

of the proposed decree, which are asserted by the government

38

to fully protect your interests»

We have talked at length

about the subordinating language of the proposed decree, but
not paragraphs two and three thereof which refer to Article II(D)(5) and Article IX»
MR, SIMPSON;

Your Honor, our feeling is that

unfortunately in this particular Instance we do have, when you
mention the other paragraphs, certain ambiguities.
Indians have not been consulted.

No, no, it is not that you object to the whole

The point is that paragraphs two and three of the

decree fully protect your interests and therefore undercut your
objection to the whole decree.
MR, SIMPSON;

But, Your Honor, that is what I do not

believe, because I do not believe—

You have not told us about that.

Why do you not

believe it?
MR, SIMPSON;

X do not believe it because I do not

aspect.

That we would concur with, Your Honor,

We do not agree with the subordination

We feel it is a false promise.
Did you have something further you wanted?
Q

I am not quite sure I understand your answer.

If the proposed decree contains, as is proposed, paragraphs
two and three, is not your position fully protected even though
the decree be entered?
MR. SIMPSON:

I do not believe so, Your Honor, and I

do not believe so because I believe it places a burden upon the
Indians then to come back and to demonstrate their new entitle­
ment to lands which were omitted to begin with.
Q

Will you not always have that burden?

MR. SIMPSON:

We have the burden, but we were

supposed to have--if there was a trustee performing-—the
assistance of 'die trustee.

And I find that the Indians have

requested help freuqnelty.

They do not get it.

That is the

reason they felt that this Court would say, "We believe that
what we have decreed has not been done? therefore, it should be
done, and we are going to insist upon it, that it would be
accomplished„"
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Q

Thank you, Mr. Simpson.

Mr. Simpson, through whose offices were the

subordination of the state claims accomplished?

40

MR. SIMPSON:
Q

The subordination of the state claims—

The Federal Government, was it not?

MR. SIMPSON:

I believe this. Justice Rehnquist.

I

think that the negotiation was to subordinate though a claim
that really was subordinate—excuse me.

It was an agreement

that made it paramount first—in other words, it was a reverse
subordination.

The states really should not be first, and they

ware.
Q

The states claimed a certain priority and gave

it up in the settlement, in the proposed decree that both the
government and the states want to enter.
MR. SIMPSON;

This is true.

Mr. Aschbrenner.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE D. ASCHBRENNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE COCOPAH INDIAN TRIBE
MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
X am speaking today on behalf of the Cocopah Indian
Tribe.

The Cocopah Tribe is the southernmost of the five

Colorado River tribes, located about 12 miles southwest of
Yuma on the eastern side of the Colorado River.

It is also the

smallest in size of its reservation, about 1,800 acres, and
its membership, less than 600.
Q

And it also has the latest—

less than six, did you say?

MR. ASCHENBRENNER;

Less than 600, almost 600.

And

it has the latest and therefore the most vulnerable priority
date, namely—
Q

1917?

MR. ASCHENBRENNERs

1917.

.I» the original decree

in this case, Cocopah was awarded water for 431 practicably
irrigable acres.

Since that time, an additional 780 acres, or

almost twice that much, of practicably irrigable acres have
been determined to be within the boundaries of the reservation,
accreted lands as a result of Cocopah v. Morton in 1975.
In 1974 the Cocopahs for the first time learned that
the government had failed to assert claims for all the practicably irrigable acres in the original tribe.

So, since

1974 and 1975 the Cceopahs, along with the other four tribes,
have repeatedly requested the United States to come back to
this Court and make claims for both these so-called omitted
lands and the boundary-determination dispute lands.

But as of

today—
Q

These would be in addition to so-called presently

perfected rights?
MR. ASCHENBRENNERj

Yes, Your Honor.

While the

omitted lands would—■
Q

Should have been presently perfected rights?

MR. ASCHENBRENNERs
Q

omitted lands?

That is right.

Yes, Your Honor.

Why does:not res judicata bar the claims to the

MR. ASCHENBRENNERs
not

We submit that res judicata does

bar the tribes and the government on their behalf from now

making a claim for the so-called omitted lands because we
claim that during the trial of this case, number one, the
government had a conflict of interest, indisputably a conflict
of interest.

They, by their complaint, expressly made claim for

the Indian tribes and they expressly made claim for the federal
reclamation projects, both competing for the same waters of the
river.

The states and the government pass off this conflict

of interest as theoretical, and it is theoretical when the
river is full and there is water enough for everybody.

But in

times of shortage, it will become actual.
So, number one, we say the government did have a
conflict of interest.

We do not say-—-that is, the two tribes—

that we can prove at this moment that that conflict of interest
caused the government's representation to be inadequate.

It

might have.
Q

Do you think the government, at least the United

States, does not now say that you would never be entitled to
any more water for the omitted lands?
MR. ASCHENBRENNERi

No, in fact we advised ten days

ago, Your Honor—
Q

I take it from their submissions here, from the

things they have said, that they just have not made up their
mind

yet.

43

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:
made up their mind.

They have now, Mr. Justice White ,

Ten days ago they told us they would

assert claims in this Court for both the omitted lands, and they
have already promised to do it for the boundary-dispute lands.
Q

And that would mean the appointment of a

special master to adjudicate to—
MR. ASCHENBRENNERs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Do the other parties, do the states oppose any

future adjudication of additional rights for omitted lands?
MR. ASCHENBRENNER;
of res judicata.

Yes, Your Honor, on the grounds

The reason we say we are not bound by res

judicata then Is, number one, the government had a conflict.
Number two, regardless of its conflict, the government admits
•that it did not make claims for all of the lands that it should
have in the original case.

In fact, the government affirma­

tively—
Q

Let us assume no conflict.

Set that aside.

And

that is exactly what the doctrine of res judicata is supposed
to take care of.

It does not allow you to say, "Gee, I wish I

had brought that up in the original case."

The case has now

been decided, and you are barred from bringing it up now.

That

is what res judicata means.
MR. ASCHENBRENNER;

Yes, Your Honor.

The exception,

however, to res judicata is if you were inadequately represented
in the original case.

ment of due process.

and fair opportunity to be heard.

The tribes in this case did

not select their own counsel, did not have their own counsel—

Now you are getting back to the conflict.

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:
Your Honor.

No, I am getting back to notice,

The tribes did not have notice that the government

was abandoning their right to certain irrigable acres.

In

fact, if they had been in the courtroom, they would have been
affirmatively misled into believing that the government was
claiming water for all irrigable, just like the master was
misled and this Court was misled into believing that.

It seems to me to hold exactly the opposite of
It holds that the United States is not barred

in a subsequent litigation where the tribe has originally
litigated against a third party because it is the United States
that has the primary right to sue.

And it seems to me, if

that is the law, you have got the thing topsy-turvy.

You are

saying in effect that this cannot be res -judicata because only
the United States would win the case and not the tribe.

not adequately represented in the original case “--and we claim
that they were not adequately represented.

Yes.

And beyond that, Your Honor,

today—-for the last four years in the case of the Cocopahs-for the last eight and nine years since boundary disputes have
been finally determined and after the tribes have pleaded with
the government to come in here and assert water on their
behalf, the government has failed to do so.

That is still your conflict or breach of

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

No, that is true, Your Honor.

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would like to respond just briefly to Mr. Simpson's
objection to the entry of the supplemental decree.

He finds

the subordination agreement specious and ambiguous.

Frankly,

if you look at it, we do not think it is ambicruous.

It

expressly provides that in times of insufficient water to
satisfy all present and perfected rights, the Indians go first.
You could not say it any clearer.

And if it was ambiguous, it

was clarified when both the states--which have the most to lose
and the United States responded to his objection and said,
"Yes, that is exactly what it means.
Q

You are the most junior of the tribes.

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:
Q

The Indians go first."

So, we have the most to lose.

And the miscellaneous rights which are not

subordinated to the Indian claims do not worry you?
MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

No.

We cannot conceive—-we agree

with the states—-we cannot conceive that the river would ever

get down to 17,000 acre-feet»
In response to Arizona's contention that we should be
barred from intervention by the doctrine of sovereign immunity,
we just briefly state that we submit that when Arizona brought
this suit to adjudicate its rights to the waters of the
Colorado River, it must necessarily be deemed to have consented
to the adjudication of the Indian rights»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERRY NOBLE FISKE, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE COLORADO RIVER INDIAN TRIBES
MR. FISKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I am representing the single entity, although
plurally stated, of Colorado River Indian Tribes in Parker,
Arizona.

We have been discussing legal issues, and I realise

that they are paramount, but I think some brief mention of the
factual aspects of this particular reservation might be

49
helpful»

It was created essentially in 1865 by act of Congress

and soon thereafter, during the administration of U. S. Grant
and the irrigation system by the United States was proposed and
presumably set into operation, it is still incomplete, still
relying upon the United States Government to assist them»
Meanwhile they watch the water go downstream being utilised by
otherso
Within the concept of the Winters doctrine, as
recognized and utilized by the special master and by this
Court, that reservation or the Indians on that reservation are
entitled to water measured by all-all—irrigable land within
that reservation»

They have not achieved that.

It has not been

presented on their behalf»
The two areas of concern-—the first are the boundary
disputes»

The major boundary dispute area was settled in 1969.

More than ten years later still no effort has been made by the
United States on behalf of the tribes to obtain the. adjudication
which was tendered to them essentially by this Court in the
decree.
/

Q

Do you dispute the fairness of the representation

in the United States in this proceeding?
MR. FISKEs

In the entire Arizona v, California?

We find it inadequate, Mr. Justice White.
Q

Do you take the position that the United States

may never settle a dispute between an Indian tribe and someone

50

else without the tribe’s consent?
MR. PXSKE;

No, I would not take that position,, that

they nearer could, no.
With regard to the larger ares, the omitted lands,
again the Winters and the special master in this Court in this
case, Arizona v. California, have indicated that the water
rights of the Indians are to measured by all irrigable land
within the reservation.
With regard to the omitted lands, the Colorado River
Indian Tribes are not seeking a redetermination of what was
considered by the master.

1

They are seeking an initial original

consideration of lands, the water claims for which were not
presented to the master.

Evidence was not presented upon them.

There was no ruling, no consideration of them.

The fact that

there was a determination that some lands were irrigable does
not constitute a determination that other lands wej:e not
irrigable.

We would not be here today on this issue if there

had been a determination certain lands are not irrigable.
The evidence that was presented to the special master
the lands that were presented to him by the United States—virtually all were accepted, indicating the conservative nature
of the presentation.
The basic determination of irrigability can be seen
on a map, a rather arbitrary line down the reservation.

All

of the lands that are irrigable are found on one side of the

line, none on the other.

Examination of that land, of the

soil conditions there, would determine that that line seems to
bear little, if any,resemblance to the actual irrigability of
those lands.
Q

There are lands not—
If thez*e were proceedings before a special

master for the determination of additional water rights,
would any part of the proceeding revolve around not only
whether a land was irrigable but the probability or economic
feasibility of being used for agriculture?
MR. FISKEs

Yes, sir.

Those elements are included,

according to the determinations prescribed by the government
in determining irrigability, presented to and utilized by the
master—•
Q

As I understand it, the United States also

obtained a concession that water adjudicated did not need to
be used for agriculture.
MR. FXSKEs
Mr. Justice White.

We do not consider that a concession,
We think that that is what the law is, and

we think that that was recognized expressly by the master and
presumably by the Court.
Our particular tribe’s feeling about the stipulation
essentially is their rights are senior.

So, we are not

concerned-”
Q
is the law?

Is there some case or something that says that

MR. PISK'E;
Q

1 do not have the citation.

Or is that just something you people from

Colorado know about?
MR. FISKE;

[Laughter!
I can certainly cite you later today the

reference in the transcript by the roaster but I could not the
case specifically.
There is some land that is not included within that
determined to be irrigable which in fact today is being
irrigated and growing crops.

There is a great deal of land

which chemically, from all standpoints of determination of
irrigability is indistinguishable from adjacent land which is
being irrigated.
The point that I wish to emphasize here is that we
are not seeking to reopen a determination before as to irri­
gable or non-irrigable

land but to have presented for the first

time lands which simply were not included at all in that
consideration.
With regard to the conflict of interest which we
think is a basis for intervention on behalf of the Colorado
River Indian Tribes, I would simply invite the Court's atten­
tion to the pleadings of the United States in 1952 when it
sought to
itself.

intervene, its motion, its brief, and the petition
Page after page, item after item of recitations of

what the United States conceded then to be a complex and
puzzling fabric of conflicting claims that it was responsible

53
for and that it had to administer and see to, conflicts even
within its own agencies, including the Department of the
Interior, the

Bureau of Land Management , the Bureau of

Reclamation, the National Park Service, all of which were
asking for the same water, which in those same pleadings the
United States conceded was inadequate..
Q

Mr, Fiske, if Congress is told the United States
i

is a litigant, that it must handle each of these types of
claims, that is the end of it.
MR. FISKE:
Rehnquist.

Except for intervention, Mr, Justice

We think that would be an alternative.

The others

that I was referring to are in fact agencies of the United
States.

They are seeking proprietary water rights in addition

to seeking water rights for the beneficiary of its trust.

And

we would merely ask to be able to work with the United States
and have access to the master for that purpose.
One, perhaps the best, example is the water that
was sought foz* and obtained for the Bureau of Land Management
for irrigation and reclamation of the public lands, according
to the application of the United States, the same kind of land
in the same area to be utilized in the same way, and the United
States was having to seek water rights for that.
Q

What is the authority for the Court granting

intervention to an Indian tribe over the objection of the United
States?--which, I take it, you indicate is doing the kind of

54
statutory duty that it is supposed to do in this case *

Are

there some statutory provisions for the tribes litigating
independently?
MR. FISKE:

There is, so far as I know, not a

specific statute—well, 1362, which deals with—Title XXVIII,
Section 1362, which authorises the bringing of actions by
tribes themselves against any party.
Q

In the district court.

MR, FISKE:
Q

Yes, sir.

Do you suppose if Congress enacted a law that

the United States, the Solicitor General, or the Interior
Department should be the exclusive representative of the
Indian tribes that would be binding on a court whan asked by
an Indian tribe to appoint different counsel for it?
MR. FISKE:

I think it probably would not be binding.

Notwithstanding the plenary power of the Congress over Indian
affairs, I think that requirement or prohibition of independent
access to the courts on a general basis would have a difficult
time standing a constitutional test.
Q

What constitutional test, a First Amendment

test?
MR. FISKE:

I think it would be a Due Process test,

to forbid them access to the courts.

I think that would foe

rozrlrary to the constitutional and congressional principles
which, have encouraged, particularly in more recent times--

Q

X am assuming an act of Congress has so provided

so there would be no room for argument as to whether or not
that was contrary to other acts of Congress.
MR. FXSKEs

That is correct.

Also with regard to the conflict of interest in the
1952 pleadings, the attorney representing the United States
appearing before the master made the statement in the trans­
cript, ?,We are going to present the Indian claims first.

And

when we get through with that, we will have to change not only
our hats, but we might have to change our entire costumes.K
There was a ready recognition of the difficulty and the
conflict.

And the United States admitted also in those

pleadings and by that transcript that they really did not

know--the representatives of the government really did not
know what their duties and responsibilities were with these
conflicting interests.
Finally, with regard to that, I would mention that
there were innumerable contracts for the delivery of water
by the United States to the very defendants in this action,
the Metropolitan Water District, the other irrigation districts.
So that at the time that the Indians were being adjudicated by
the United States, they had the conflicting interests of the
other defendants in this action.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?
Mr. Claiborne.

Thank you, Mr. Fiske.

56

ORAL ARGUMENT OP LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

)

MR, CLAIBORNEs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
If I may first address the position of the United
States with respect to the entry of the joint motion, as it
has been called—as the Court knows, we urge unequivocally
the entry of that supplemental decree which is attached to the
joint motion which we have joined, originally a joint motion
as between the state parties now joined also by the United
States.

3

We urge the entry of that supplemental decree first

because we think it is procedurally correct, that it is something
that should have been done long ago.

It is the remaining

matter under Article VI of the original decree.
But, more important, we urge the entry of that
supplemental decree because, in our view, it is in the interest
of the tribes for whom we appear in this litigation that it foe
done, and that it be done without awaiting any other matters
that might be ripe

for adjudication in this Court.

We say

that, as the Court know, because the subordination agreement,
in our view, fully protects the interest of the tribes in both
the water already adjudicated to them and any additional water
which they may gain by reason of adjusted boundaries though not
by reason of any claim—
Q

Does your position necessitate saying that the

57
United States may settle a lawsuit affecting Indian tribes
without the consent of the tribe?

)

MR, CLAIBORNE:

It does, Mr, Justice White, and we ;

invoke the Heckman case as plain authority for that proposition»
We go on to say, as Mr. Justice Stewart has pointed out, that
the entry of the decree not only gives advantage to the tribes
but certainly does not prejudice them or jeopardize their
claims in any way.

On the contrary, it leaves open expressly

any claims made under Article II or Article IX.

And, what is

more, it hastens, in our view, the adjudication of additional
water rights for the tribes.

)

It allows litigation henceforth

to be about the Indians6 water, not a bickering or a squabbling
about the states' water.
Q

And it would not decide in advance whether the

water rights for omitted lands are precluded one way or another?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

On the contrary, Mr. Justice White,

we understand the provision of the proposed supplemental
decree which says this has no effect, on Article IX to mean this
does not resolve that question, whether any claim for omitted
lands is or not—Q

So, the decree would not put its hand on one

side or the other the argument that will take place as to
whether res judicata bars some of these claims.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Exactly so, Mr. Justice White.

We find ourselves in the difficulty that in saying

58

this, in urging the entry of the decree, we are opposing the
wishes of three of the tribes before the Court.
with some reluctance.

We do that

But we would not do it if we were not as

sure as we are that it is in their interests, notwithstanding
their saying to the contrary.

And as trustee, having the

right but also the obligation to take that course which seems
to us to advantage our client, as we view these three tribes,
we, notwithstanding their objection, urge the prompt entry
of that decree.
about it.

But we would not do it if we were in doubt

We are in no doubt that it is in their interests.
Turning now to the second question before the Court,

which are the several motions for intervention, here we treat
of course all five tribes on an equal footing.

And we take the

same view with respect to the three tribes—
Q
Interrupt you.

Could I just go back a moment,

I am sorry to

But to the extent there is a claim that the

United States had a conflict of interest in the adjudication
of this case and at the same time a conflict of interest when
you negotiated this settlement, is there any answer to that or
need you give one?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

We do and without reservation deny

that we have suffered under a conflict of interest, that we
have taken any action as a result of it, or that our action
today in supporting the entry of the supplemental decree is in
any way the product of a conflict of interest.

At least at

59

this stage of the litigation it must be clear that we have no
other conflicting interests to put forward»

)

There is no

question of additional water—
Q

That may go to the res judicata question down

the line but not here.
MR. CLAIBORNEs

Not here, Mr. Justice White.

That

would be my submission.
Turning to intervention, as I say, we take the same
view with respect to all five tribes provided that the
petition for intervention of the three tribes-—that is, the
Port Mojave Motion, as it is called—is limited, as is the
other motion? that is, limited to asking for additional water,

>
and does not either oppose the entry of the supplemental
decree-~to that extent, we xrould urge denial of that in ter vention—or dispute the present perfected rights which are
sought to be finalised by the entry of that supplemental decree.
To that extent, we would oppose that motion.
that the

But to the extent

motion of the three tribes is limited, as is that of

the two tribes, we would support it equally.
Q

On that point, Mr. Claiborne, supposing inter­

vention were denied entirely without prejudice to the right of
the tribes to assert at a future date claims to additional
water after the government has had an opportunity to analyze
the claims and pass on what they exactly should be, would that,
in your judgment, in any way prejudice the tribes?

60
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Ftevens, if the proviso

that it was without prejudice to their ricrht to file or the
United States to file on their behalf, no, it could not
prejudice.

I would submit to this Court*—
Q

Is it possible also that such a denial might

eliminate some areas of litigation that might otherwise take
place?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I fear not.

And

I would submit to the Court that the matters of the claims
with respect to additional waters are now ripe

or sufficiently

ripe for adjudication, that it is appropriate to grant inter­
vention today,
Q

Is the only court in which the omitted lands

issue be settled is here?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
Q

I think so.

Not so the boundary disputes?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice White, there are two

answers to the last question.

In my reading of the previous

decree of this Court, only this Court can give additional wetter,
whether in respect of enhanced boundaries or in respect of
omitted lands.

This Court on the last occasion declined to

settle boundaries.

I would invite it to decline again.

But

I would submit that those boundaries have now administratively
been finalized.

There are in fact, with respect to those that

are relevantly claimed, no outstanding judicial proceedings—

61

Q

Your colleagues in the states or someone sug­

gested. that the boundary disputes be litigated locally.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

The states seem to take two views.

As I understood Mr. Noble, he was suggesting that the master
appointed by this Court should do what he attempted to do on
the last occasion and was told by this Court he should not have
done.

I understood Mr. Will to say--or perhaps it was

Mr. Hunsaker—that no, that was a matter appropriate for
district court resolution.
I take a different view, that it is appropriate for
neither at the moment.
administratively.

These boundaries have been finally set

One of them has been set since 1969.

What­

ever judicial challenges there i*ere have long since been
settled by finaul judgments—
0

Because the administrative judgment is final.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

At least until such time as a suit

is filed, a suit is outstanding, this Court does not have to
wait until the end of time when all possible suiters have
either filed their suits or been precluded by—
Q

7\re those boundaries subject to attack in the

district court now or not?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
White.

A difficult question, Mr. Justice

We would take the view first that they were final, that

at least the administrative action was final.
Secondly, we would wonder who had standing to challenge:

62

them—that is, the boundaries»

We are not talking about the

title to the land within the reservation—the boundaries.
Perhaps the tribes would , if they were dissatisfied with the
settlement of the boundary under 1362—but they are not
challenging over there.
tive decision.

They are content with the administra­

The states—-this is all public domain land,

it is not state land—in principle have no standing.

They may

say that because it affects their water allocation, therefore
they are a party aggrieved and therefore they have standing.
That would be a matter for debate, as to which I do not want
to make binding concession.

But it is a close question.

In any event, no state has challenged any boundary,
and in one case that boundary has been finally fixed some nine
years ago.

Therefore,'in the terms of the decree of this

Court in 1964, which said you may come back and ask for more
water when the boundaries have been finally determined—I read
that to mean finally determined by administrative action and
especially so—
Q

That was only with respect to two reservations

though, was it not?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stewart, that is so.

But

in fairness, the reason only two reservations were listed, it
must be supposed, is because it was then only known that there
were these two boundary disputes.

It has since turned out that

all five reservations have such boundary disputes--

63

Q

But the decree in it talked about only two

reservations, the Fort Mojave Reservation and the Colorado
River Reservation»
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Justice Stewart, the states have

not taken that point and, if I may say so, quite fairly»
Q

It is very fair, but we are talking about what

the decree says.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I would submit, Mr. Justice Stewart,

that the decree leaves the opening in Article IX that any
further motion—that any party is free to apply the foot of the
decree for any further—
0

The general language of Article IX, you think.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

—and supplemental decree, and that

this certainly fairly falls within the reservation jurisdiction
which this Court—
Q

In any event, that is not implicated in approv­

ing the supplemental decree.
MR. CLAIBORNE:
0

Not at all.

Mr. Claiborne, I do not think I caught your

answer to My Brother Stevens question when he suggested earlier
perhaps, What would you think of denying both petitions for
intervention?

Did you answer that you did not think we ought

to deny them both?
/

MR. CLAIBORNE:
to that.

I only perhaps gave a partial answer

My first answer is that if it were done with a view

64
to its being reopened at a later time, the time is now.
Q

1

As to what issues?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

The issue of the boundaries.

That

is ripe for adjudication, and the issue of the omitted lands.
Though when we filed our papers, we spoke of further investi­
gations that need to be done, and indeed there are further
investigations that need to be dona.

But very shortly—and I

am speaking in terms of the end of this year~-the government
ought to have had its tatter in order sufficiently to put
before the Court or its master whatever claims, in our view—
and they are indeed more conservative than the claims
advanced by some of the tribes—are appropriately put forward

)

both in respect to the boundaries and the disputed lands.
And* therefore, I would not urge the denial of the motions
for intervention because the matter is ripe.
Q

But you do strongly urge the denial of one of

the motions for intervention on the part of the three tribes.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Only in so far, Mr. Justice Stewart,

as it attacks the - entry of the decree.
Q

But otherwise'—

But then you would group all five tribes under

the motion of the two tribes?

)

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed, Mr. Justice Stewart.

To fully answer Mr. Justice Stevens, I have not
completely answered.

I have simply said the matter is ripe.

I have not said why intervention, why not just the United States

putting forward these clai.ms?

It is certainly true, in our

view, that intervention is not necessary.
it is desirable.

But we do think

There is a congressional policy, which is

evident in 1352 of the Judicial Code to allow tribes to repre­
sent themselves.

There is a provision which allows the

Secretary of the Interior today to appoint attorneys for
tribes.

In the peculiar situation of this litigation in light

of the recriminations that have been made against the United
States and its default in representation

in the past, and in

order to avoid further litigation about whether or not the
United States has advanced all the claims that are appropriate,
it seems to us right that in furthering the appearance of
justice, that the tribes do be allowed to speak for themselves.
It does not mean that the United States would drop out.
Q

That is what I wanted to find out.

I am a

little pusssled about- the responsibility for a given tribe8s
claim if the tribe through, its counsel takes one position
th@ United States takes another position.

and

Which attorney will

speak for the tribe if they are allowed to come in?
MR. CLAIBORNEs

Mr. Justice Stevens, in this litiga-

tion that is a little like the problem of the City of Loo
Angeles and the State of California both

being in the lawsuit.

It is no greater embarrassment for the tribe than the United
States to be on the other side.
But, as a practical matter, the United States, as I

have indicated,, will always be the more conservative of the
two advocates.

If the state has settled with the tribe.» and

the tribe is willing * the United States is not going to stand
in the way—
Q

No, font the converse is the problem»

will the

United States still be free to settle over the objection of
the tribe»

And, if it is, how will it avoid the appearance of

impropriety

that apparerently causes you to consent to some­

thing that pu say is not necessary?
MR» CLAIBORNE?

I would have thought, once the tribe

had been given permission to intervene as a full party, as a
matter of the rules of litigation and quite outside of our
role as trustee, no settlement could be effected without the
consent of the tribe and indeed that to me is—
Q

So,, then this will make a significant change in

the ability of the case to be disposed of without further
litigation because you have to have a settlement among all
five tribes by their separate counsel and not merely by the
United States, which might think a settlement is in their
best interest and otherwise would have the power to agree to
such a settlement»
MR» CLAIBORNE:
Stevens.

I appreciate the point, Mr. Justice

I simply suggest that in the circumstances of this

case—
Q

It seems to me the government is inconsistent

On the ona hand# you are saying there is nothing at all to the
conflict of interest allegation.

On the other hand, you are

saying it is sufficiently substantial that we should depart
from our normal course of handling these cases.
MR. CLAIBORNE?

Mr. Justice Stevens, it was only in

the Moa case two tarns ago, I believe, that this Court said
that it was appropriate for the tribe to represent itself.
The fact that the United States could have been the plaintiff
did not in any way suggest the tribe was not the appropriate
party.

But then went on to say that because, had the United

States been the plaintiff, there would have been a waiver of
the bar against enjoining the enforcement of state statutes,
that same rule would be given--the tribe would enjoy the
benefit of that same rule.

But in passing the

to situations in which we were co-plaintiffs.

Court referred
And 1 take it—

and that was based partly on the Heckman case*—that that is now
the preferred litigating posture, that is, that the tribe and
the United States both be permitted as full-fledged partici­
pants in litigation which so vitally concerns the tribes.
Q

I think the point was made—I think by

Mr. Simpson—that maybe a motion to intervene is not what this
ought to be.

Have not the tribes been in this litigation, and

are they not still in it, fro® the very first moment that the
United States intervened on their behalf and as their
representative?

68
MS, CLAIBORNEs

But, Mr. Justice Stewart, if they

have a right to do more than whisper in our ear or to speak
to the Court by way of amicus curiae in a way that is not

)

binding, either on the Court or on their opponents in Court,
they must intervene as a full party.
Q

normally the beneficiary of a trust does not

even have the right to participate amicus curiae nor even
whisper into the trustee's ear.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

The trustee represents them.

If this were ordinary trust law,

Mr. Justice Stewart, certainly that would be the case.
Q

It is true in general in fiduciary laws, is it

not?

)

MR. CLAIBORNE:

That is so.

But, as we know,

Indian law is a thing of itself.
Q

’

It is a strange and wonderful thing.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

I know.

And I would ask the Court to indulge

this much more strangeness by permitting the tribes to inter­
vene with our undertaking to continue in the suit so that they
might feel—
t

Q

Let me ask you, Mr. Claiborne, have any of the

conversations with the states addressed themselves to a

)

possible settlement with respect to additional water rights
for the Indians or not?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes? indeed, most of the delay that

has been undergone from 1967 when all these claims were filed

69
Q

So, you in effect, are saying, as my Brother

Stevens says, "Let ns litigate.

Let ns not settle.

Let us

let the Indians in and let us litigate it."
MR. CLAIBORNEs

It may be, Mr. Justice White—-and I

hope it will be so-“that once the supplemental decree is
entered, a new phase of litigation can begin.

Our attempt had

been—-and this is revealed in the papers--to do both at the
same time, that is, to get the states to agree as a condition
for the entry of the supplemental decree, to add in the
additional water for the boundaries as we then claim them?
nothing, however, for omitted lands.
Q

You need a little help at the bargaining table,

I take it.
MR. CLAIBORNEi

The states declined that invitation,

but they may be open to it once their perfected rights are
judicially approved.
Q

Mr. Claiborne, would you say that the power and

authority of the United States as a statutory trustee under an
act of Congress is greater, broader, or less than a private
trustee under ancient traditional rules of law.
MR. CLAIBORNEs

The easy answer, Mr. Chief Justice,

is different without resolving whether it is greater or less.
I would have thought in soma respects it must be less in that
the tribes, though treated as wards end dependents, are in fact
adults who are able to speak for themselves and whose right of

70
self-government has now been largely recognized, including in
other acts of Congress,

So, one must not treat them as

incompetent beneficiaries in other respects.

Certainly our

power to dispose of Indian property and to make rules and
regulations for Indian reservations may be greater than in the
case of a private trust.

I hope I have answered your question,

Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Very well.

You have two mimxtes remaining here for your side
of the table, Mr. Simpson,

There is no constitutional require­

ment that you use it, however.
