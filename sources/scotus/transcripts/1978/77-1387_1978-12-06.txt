PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No* 77-138?, Federal Open Market Committee of the
Federal Reserve System v. David R. Merrill*
Mr. Geller, I think you may proceed whenever you are
ready..
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR* GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This eases arises under the Freedom of Information
Act.

But unlike the other cases this Court has considered

involving the Act, here the government is not contending that
certain agency documents are not disclosable to the public.
What we are contending is that the Act grants the District
Court discretion In an appropriate case to delay the public
release of agency documents for a reasonable period of time,
ju3t like In civil discovery, where the Immediate release of
those documents would prevent or Impair the effectuation of
an Important governmental policy*
We also contend, c? course, that this is an appro­
priate case for the exercise of that discretion*

Nov/, the

particular documents and agency involved here are the socalled domestic policy directives —QUESTION:

Let me ask you a question, Mr. Geller,

about the discretion contention.

Here the District Court

simply required the production of the documents., didn’t it?
MR, GELLER:
QUESTION?

Yes.
And so I take it your contention is that

the discretion could only be exercised in one way in this
particular case.
NR0 GELLER:

No0

The District Court took the posi­

tion that it had no discretion because the Act required im­
mediate disclosure.

The Act is not allowing it to weigh the

interests of the government in a temporary withholding of the
documents against the interests of the public in gaining im­
mediate access to those documents.

It our position that the

Act does grant the District Court that discretion and indeed
we assume that if this Court adopts that submission, the
appropriate disposition would be a remand to the District
Court for determination whether to exercise that discretion
in this case»
QUESTION:

So you don’t claim that it comes under

any of the exemptions?

MR0 GELLER:

We do*

We claim that it falls clearly

within Exemption 5, and we construe Exemption 5 to accord
the District Court discretion, as I have said, in an appro­
priate case to decide whether or not to release otherwise
disclosable documents, where the government has made a showing
of harm from the immediate release

5
QUESTION:
MRo GELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

You said exclusively on Exemption 5»
That’s correct.
Not on 4 or 8?
No.

The only exemption we are relying

on in this Court is Exemption 5.
QUESTION:

Well, the section dealing with exemptions

beginning, "This section does not apply to matters that are,”
and then 5 says, "inte -agency or intra-agency memorandums or
letters which would not be available by law to a party other
than an agency in litigation with the agency.”

Now, where

does the District Court’s discretion stem from?
MR. GELLER:

We believe it comes from the language

"would not be available to a party».,in litigation with the
agency” which we think what Congress intended was to mirror
the practice under civil discovery,

I think this Court has

held that on several occasions, and I hope to get to that a
little later in the argument.

Of course, in civil discovery,

the court would engage frequently in a balancing process when
it is not dealing with documents that are subject to an abso­
lute privilege or documents not subject to any privilege
whatsoever*

There is a whole middle ground in which it has

to weigh the competing Interests, and we claim that the same
analysis should spply under the Freedom of Information Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, while we have you Interrupted,

is the stay order still in effect?

6
MR. GELLER:

The stay order is still in effect, that

is correct.
Now, before turning to the specific FOI exemption
that we claim is applicable in this case, which is Exemption 5,
I would like to begin by briefly explaining the importance of
the Open Market Committee’s policy functions, how the domestic
policy directives relate to those functions, and why the pre­
mature release of these sensitive documents would severely
frustrate implimention of the committee's policies0
The Federal Reserve System is, of course, the
Nation's central bank and it helps to achieve the country's
economic goals through its influence on monetary policy, that
Is, the availability and cost of bank reserves, bank credit
and moneyo
The system essentially has three main goals and three
main tools with which to accomplish these goals.

First is the

setting of the discount rate which is the rate that is charged
member banks on borrowing from the Regional Federal Reserve
Bank®

The second tool is the board’s power to change reserve

requirements, that is, the percentage of reserves that member
banks must hold in back of deposits.

And the final monetary

tool of the system, and the one that concerns us here today is
the power to engage In so-called open market operations, that
is, the purchase or sale of large amounts of securities,
principally United States government securities in the open

7
market 0
Simply stated, when the Federal Reserve System buys
securities, it Increases the total volume of bank reserves
because the Fed's payment for the securities is ordinarily
deposited in the seller's bank account and is credit to that
bank's reserve account in its Regional Reserve Bank, and
conversely when the system sells securities the sales price
typically is deducted from the reserve account of the buyer's
bank and this decreases the volume of reserves held by that
bank.
Now, these changes in the volume of bank reserves
obviously Influences the ability of these banks to make loans
and investments which in turn has a substantial effect on the
availability of money and the level of interest rates.
The open market operation’s tool is by far the
If

Federal Reserve System's most important monetary policy in­
strument,

Open market operations are extremely flexible,

unlike the other tools I have mentioned, and they need to be
used to the extent and only to the extent necessary to accomp­
lish the system's short or long-term monetary policy goals.
As a result, while the discount rate and reserve
requirements are changed only occasionally, the Fed enters the
market on virtually every business day and either buys or
sells millions of dollars worth of securities, depending upon
what monetary goal it is trying to accomplish.

8
Now9 the organ of the Federal Reserve System that
Is responsible for directing these open market operations Is
the petitioner in this case, the Federal Open Market Committee„
The committee is composed of twelve members, the seven
Governors of the Federal Reserve Board and five representa­
tives of the Regional Reserve Banks.
approximately once a month.

The committee meets

Its meetings begin with a run­

down of general economic developments and a consideration of
what economic developments might arise in the immediate
future8 and at the end of the meeting the system decides what
its plans for the open market operations in the up-coming
month should, be, and these plans are embodied in the Domestic
Policy Directive, the subject of this litigation, which is
adopted by the Open Market Committee at the conclusion of its
monthly meeting.
QUESTION:

We can, under your theory, legitimately

have access to that information now?
MR„ GELLER:

During the one-month period that the

Domestic Policy Directive is in effect, only employees of the
Federal Reserve System with the need of access to that direc­
tive have access to that directive, which would be the
account manager who actually does the buying and selling of
the open market — of securities in the open market„
QUESTION:
MRS GELLER:

How many people?
I would say it

is just a handful of

9
people and generally high officials of the Federal Reserve
System.

It Is a very small number of people that have actual

access to the Domestic Policy Directive during the one month
of its effectiveness.
Now? the directive takes the form of instructions to
the system's account manager in New York*

He is an official

of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and he does the
actual buying and selling of these securities in the open
market s
These instructions state what the Federal Open Market
Committee6s general monetary policy goals for the up-coming
month are.

And what is more important, the directive also

specifically notes what the committee's objectives are for
the rate of growth of the Nation's money supply and what the
permissible fluctuation of the so-called federal funds rate in
the up-coming month is according to the committee.
The federal funds rate is the interest rate that
member banks charge each other for overnight loans, and It is
an extremely sensitive and accurate barometer of tightness or
ease In the economy in regard to the availability of money.
The account manager begins to Implement the direc­
tive immediately upon its adoption.

The committee has always

kept these Domestic Policy Directives confidential during the
one-month period of their effectiveness*

The current practice

is to delay disclosure of the directive until a few days

10

following the next month’s committee meeting»
QUESTION:

Mr» Geller, do you think that knowledge­

able observers of the market reactions will know what is going
on after a few days* however, when the Fed gets into the
market?
MR0 GELLER:

I don’t think so.

They can make ■—■

knowledgeable market observers can make educated guesses based
upon the account manager’s buying or selling of securities in
the open market on a daily basis, but there is a certain level
of uncertainty that attaches to their observations» undertainty
that wouldn’t exist if the directive was made public, and that
uncertainty is very important because it dampens economic
activity and it prevents these market observers from entering
the market in a major way»
More important, I don’t think that just looking at
the account manager’s daily buying or selling would give you
an accurate picture of what the directive is likely to be
because most of the account manager’s daily buying or selling
may not be pursuant to the directive.

In other x^ords, it may

not be for the purpose of accomplishing the goals set forth
in the directive; it may be simply a response to something
that has happened that day in the market„

Let me give you

an example.
Let’s assume that for a number of reasons there is
a temporary glut of money in the market, maybe because of

11
changes in Treasury balances at the Federal Reserve Banks or
because of the float.
the Fed expeeted.

There is more money In the market than

Now* when that happens, interest rates

might be expected to drop because more money is available.
The account manager sees developments and might i*ell decide
to sell securities, in other words to take money out of the
market.

Now, this would not be for the purpose of raising

Interest rates, it would be merely to keep Interest rates
constant in a situation in which they might otherwise drop.
So that if someone merely looked at what the account manager
did in the market that day, which is to sell large amounts of
securities, he might get the impression that the directive is
telling the account manager to attempt to raise interest
rates, \*herea3 that wouldn’t be an accurate picture, the
account manager is merely attempting to meet developments
that have occurred in the market.
Now, as I was saying, the directive is kept secret
until a few days following the next month’s meeting.

At that

point, the directive for the month just ended is made avail­
able to the public and it is published in the Federal
Register.

Thus, for example, the Domestic Policy Directive

adopted at the committee’s meeting on October 17, 1978» was
released to the press on November 24, .1978, and was sent to
the federal Register on November 2§, 1978.
The primary reason for this delay in publication has

12
always been the committee's concern that advanced public
notice of its open market policy decisions would create ex­
cessive reactions or other disturbances in the securities
market that would Interfere with the committee's ability to
implement its open market decisions»

There would be a so-

called announcement effect as market participants attempted
to realize financial gains in anticipation of the committee-s
purchases or sales or securities in the up-coming month»
Now, this is spelled out at greater length in our
brief and in the affidavit submitted to the District Court *
but let me give the Court just one example.
The Federal Open Market Committee each month buys or
sells literally billions of dollars worth of government
securities.

Let’s assume that it was known that in the month

to follow the committee Intended to attempt to raise the
federal funds rate which, as I said, is the interest rate at
which banks lend money to each other on an overnight basis.
Market investors could reasonably assume, if they had «access
to this directive, that to raise the federal funds rate, the
committee would seek to decrease available reserves,, which
would mean that the Fed would be engaging in the sale or large
amounts of securities.

Armed with this knowledge, it is

likely that many investors would react immediately by also
selling government securities, and this would tend to depress
securities prices and inflate interest rates unnaturally and,

13
as we have explained in our brief9 these sudden movements in
security prices and Interest rates might be larger than the
committee contemplated and might even be beyond the ability
of the committee to control on occasion.

At the very least,

these market reactions would make It immeasurably harder for
the committee to accomplish gradually what it set out to do
that month„
QUESTION:

Mr® Geller, of course that is the view

of the agency, but it is not a universally held view, is it?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Well, the —
For example, Milton Friedman would dis-

agree, I guess.
MR® GELLER:

The respondents have never rebutted

that showing®
QUESTION:

Milton Friedman would disagree, would he

not?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:
MR® GELLER:

Excuse me?

I’m sorry®

Milton Friedman would disagree?
Milton Friedman — well, Milton

Friedman, the statements that respondents have quoted from
time to time from Milton Friedman really relates to the
committee’s claim that the immediate disclosure of these
domestic policy directives would allow market specfculators to
make immense profits, unjust profits, and there is some dis­
pute as to that®

But there is I think not a great amount of

dispute that the immediate release of these domestic policy
directives might well hinder the committee's ability to carry
out its monetary policy goals9 which of course is a separate
point.
QUESTION:

Suppose these are sophisticated people

dealing with economic forces, I suppose if It were a given
premise that these policy directives would be disclosed then
the policy directive might be a little different in order to
achieve the result that was desired —
MR, SELLER:
QUESTION:

Well, it may not —
— knowing that the public would know

about this and that they would augment the effect and there­
fore the policy directive would discount that,
MR. QELLER:

I think that that is not as easily done

as —
QUESTION:
am concerned,

Well, this Is all difficult, as far as I

I assume we are dealing with experts,

MR, GELLER:

I think, Mr. Justice Stewart, that your

example is an excellent reason why this type of Information
falls within Exemption 5.

Exemption 5, as this Court said In

Sears, was meant to protect the ability of federal agencies
to make decisions, and that ability may be hindered not only
by the release of pre-declsional materials but, as I am going
to get to in a minute, it can be hindered by the premature
release of final decisions themselves,

I think* as you

15
correctly assessed,, if these directives, if the committee knew
that these directives were going to be made public prematurely
in their view they would take a lot of other measures that
*

might well skew their decision-making process.
QUESTION:

Well, the directive would be published,

it would be decided upon and then it would become the direc­
tive and in light of the fact it would be public knowledge and
therefore the directive would be different in substance.
MR, GELLER;

Well, I think there is a limit to how

different the directives can be and still accomplish the goals
which the directive now accomplishes.
QUESTION:

Instead of the committee buying "X,f

billions of dollars, they buy one-half of "X", assuming that
— and assume that the speculators and the public will buy the
other half.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

I think it wouldn3t work quite that way.
Undoubtedly It is not that simple.

(Laughter)
\

QUESTION:

Is it enough for your ease that nobody,

no one can predict with any certainty what would be the conse­
quences of disclosure?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Well, that is correct.
That there are serious consequences,

Isn’t that enough for you?
MR. GELLER:

I think that is.

It is certainly one

16
major part of our argument.

It is not the end of our argu­

ment* but I think it is certainly the beginning of our argu­
ments that there would-- there is likely to be some deleteri­
ous consequencesto the policy decisions of the Federal Open
Market committee if there was premature disclosure.
I should add here at this point that the regulations
of the committee5 12 CFR 271.5* that allow for this delayed
access to the Domestic Policy Directives were not promulgated
in response to the Freedom of Information Act and not promul­
gated in response to the suit0

They date back* we have been

able to date them back in published form to 19^6„

I am sure

they date back even ten years earlier to when the committee
was formed,,
There has been a consistency of view among the many
hundreds of members of the committee and the Federal Reserve
Board that secrecy is an essential element of the Federal
Open Market Committee's ability to carry out its statutory
requirements.
QUESTION:

But isn’t it also true that there are

some alumnae who disagree?
MRa QELLER:
confusion here.

Well* I think there may well be some

There is more disagreement I think about the

so-called memoranda of discussion which v/ere really minutes
of the meeting of each Federal Open Market Committee meeting
and which the Federal Open Market Committee xfas releasing —

17
QUESTION;

No, I a confining my comment Just to the

announcement of the specific policy that will be followed dur­
ing the ensuing thirty days0

Is it not correct that there is

expert opinion that, although there would be consequences from
immediate disclosures those consequences would be beneficial,
there is a respectable body of opinion that way?

Now, maybe

that doesn’t control it, but there is -MRo GELLER:

That is true, there are certain

economists who have taken that view»
QUESTION:

Basically —

Including alumnae of the Federal Reserve

Board?
MR0 GELLER:

Well, there is Governor Maisel, right0

Of course, the District Court and the Court of
Appeals decided this case on the assumption that there would
be harm to the Federal Open Market Committee and that —
QUESTION:

It seems to me, as the Chief Justice

suggested to you, that your argument would be the same even if
you acknowledge that there could be a legitimate difference of
opinion on this point.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

I think that is —
Therefore, I don't understand why you. are

spending so much time trying to convince us of one side or the
other of an irrelevant debate.
MR. GELLER:

Well, I think if the argument that there

would be harm here was totally fanciful, it might be a different

18
situation»

But let me get to this lawsuit, which began in

May

QUESTION:
question»

Mr. Cellar, could I ask you one more

Suppose this group met weekly instead of monthly

and the lag were only seven days instead of thirty, would you
be making the same argument?

MR» GELLER:

We would bo making the same arguments

although perhaps the need for secrecy — no one is suggesting
that It has to be announced the minute it is adopted»

There

has to be some lag in publication time, and If the time between
meetings was sufficiently small, then perhaps the current
directive would never have to be published in the Federal
Register immediately upon its adoption.
QUESTION:

I suppose your opposition would say still

that It affected its academic needs?
MR. GELLER:

I am sure he would.

The issue in this case then is whether the Freedom
of Information Act

invariably requires the government agency

to divulge Its policy decisions as soon as they have been
adopted, even in instances where immediate disclosure would
prevent those decisions from ever being successfully carried
out.
It is the government's position that the Act does
not require that harsh result and that the District Court has
discretion under Exemption 5 to delay the release of agency

19
documents in such a situation for a reasonable period of time,
even though the documents may embody a final policy decision
that might at some point have to be disclosed.
The courts below rejected this contention primarily
because they viewed Exemption 5 as directed only to pradecislonal memoranda, agency memoranda0

The District Court

and the Court of Appeals viewed the Domestic Policy Directive
not as pre-decisional but as the committee's final policy de­
cision.
But while it is certainly true that the prime moti­
vation for the exemption was to prevent public access to
internal non-final communications, the disclosure of which
would injure an agency's decision-making process, we believe
it is equally true that that was not the exemption's only
purpose0
Prior to the passage of the FOIA, a number of
federal agencies complained to Congress that their policy de­
cisions could be adversely affected not only by the release
of predecisional materials but also by the premature release
of the final agency decisions themselves»

For instance, one

example that was given by the Defense Department and the
General Services Administration is that those agencies on
occasion Issue instructions to their employees on how much,
for example, to pay, what the maximum to pay would be for
materials or real estate or things like that, and the agencies

20
were afraid if they had. to release those decisions after they
were made but before they were carried out, that is before the
sales purchases were consummated9 that thair plans would be
severely frustrated, and it is not hard to imagine why»
It is also of more than passing interest here today
that Congress at that time was also informed of the serious
problems that were likely to occur if the Federal Open Market
Committeeas policy decisions concerning purchase or sales of
securities in the open market had to be prematurely disclosed»
Now, the House and Senate committee reports on the
FOIA state that Exemption 5 was drafted to meet those concerns.
The reports indicate that premature disclosure of final agency
plans and not just the disclosure of Internal agency materials
generated before an agency’s plans were finalized were meant
to be covered by the exemption.
This congressional intent is also clearly reflected
we think in the language of the exemption itself.

Exemption 5

as finally drafted permits the non-disclosure of

inter-agency

or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be
available to a party.».in litigation with the agency.”
Congress had been concerned only with preventing
oubllc access to pre-decisional memoranda.

This obviously

would have been a rather peculiar way of achieving that
result»
QUESTION:

Well, it is a rather peculiar way of

21
achieving any result, isn't It, that litigation —
MRo GELLER:

I think it is a rather sensible way,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because Congress couldn’t anticipate
every situation that might arise in which a plaintiff under
the FOIA might seek access to some internal governmental
memorandum»

But Congress did, as this Court said in EPA v.

Mink, legislate against the backdrop of the enormous case law
under civil discovery procedures and therefore —
QUESTION;

What analogy do you draw?

litigation with an agency.

You talk about

You have to envision some hypo­

thetical case in which the agency is the defendant and someone
else is the plaintiff.

You have no idea what the subject

matter of the litigation is.

Do you limit it just to

privileges that are recognized in every discovery situation,
or do you interpret it in terms of a rule to compel disclosure
under Rule 26?
MR. GELLER;

Yes, we think that Congress said as

much®
QUESTION:
MR» GELLER:

Well, the question was in the disjunctive.
This Court said in EPA v. Mink and in

subsequent cases that Congress, when adopting Exemption 5,
legislated against the baekdrop of civil discovery of law,
meant to allow the government to take advantage of any recog­
nized privilege available under either case law or statute
and utilized in civil discovery, and that the District Court

22
should

and let me quote what the Court said in EPA v® Mink.

"The exemption#!' wrote the Court, "contemplates tha,t the
public’s access to internal memoranda will be governed by the
same flexible common-sense approach that has long governed
private parties discovery of documents involved in litigation
with government agencies®"
QUESTION:

Does that go beyond claims of privilege

at common law that would be recognized in discovery?
MR. GELLER:

Yes®

I think that what Congress --

there are three types of documents®

There are documents that

would always be discoverable in litigation with the government,
they are not subject to any privilege wh&tsoever®

There are

other types of documents that you could never discover;/ in
litigation against the document because there is an absolute
privilege that attaches to them.
Now, there is a large body of material that falls
somewhere in between that may or may not be discoverable in
litigation against the government, depending upon the relative
needs of the plaintiff and the defendant, if the defendant
is a government agency®
Now, we think that what Congress intended, and we
think there is much in the legislative history and in this
Court’s opinions construing Exemption 5 which supports this,
what Congress Intended that the District Court would, engage
in is the same sort of balancing process v/hen confronted with

23
an POIA request for that type of material.

What he would

balance is the government’s need, the government's need for
secrecy.

And I should emphasise here that the government is

not contending that these documents need never be disclosed.
We are only suggesting that because of important government
interests, they need to be disclosed immediately but rather
should only be disclosed four weeks after they are adopted.
What would be weighed against the interest that the
government puts forward in support of limited non-disclosure
would be the public interest, not the interest of the
individual POIA litigant in gaining access to these particular
documents,

It is clear that under the POIA, you are not

allotted to inquire into the interests of a particular plaintiff
who has made the POIA request.

But I think it is clear that

you have to inquire in order to engage in the balancing
process, into what the public interest is in —
QUESTION:

Well, this hypothicates the government

being on one side and the public interest being on the other,
MR. GELLER:

I think that is what the POIA contem­

plates under Exemption 5 and in dealing with a document which
is not subject to an absolute privilege or not totally un­
privileged when it falls in this middle ground.

I think the

Court said in Bannercraft that the focus of the POIA surely
is on disclosure but it is not disclosure for the benefit of
the particular plaintiff who has made the POIA request, it is

disclosure for the benefit of the public0
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Geller, suppose the Court of

Appeals was wrong in saying that 26(c)(7) doesn’t apply to any
kind of a governmental entity, which I guess it decided, didn't
it?
MR0 GELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Suppose it is wrong in that and that we

say that the government in an FOIA case can take advantage of
26(c)(7)s then any other litigant can take advantage of it?
Suppose it was decided that this was not confidential commer­
cial information?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

I think if the —
Suppose it was decided that way, you

wouldn't nevertheless argue that it would be nondlsooverable
under some other rule, would you?
MRo GELLER:

Yes, I think — well, just in civil

litigation, you needn’t pick only one discovery provision and
rely totally on that*
QUESTION:

I know, but when you move to some other

rule, the heart of your argument is the need for secrecy«,
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Again —
And if it ware decided that 26 (c)(7)

wouldn’t protect it, it seems to me your argument is utterly
destroyed.

But I am not suggesting that 26(c)(7) would be

decided that way.

25
MR* GELLER:

But there are other provisions of

section 26.
QUESTION:
MR„ GELLER:
QUESTION;
MR. GELLER:

Like what?
Like section 26(c)(2),, for example0
What about it?
We suggest ~ section 26(c)(2) grants

the District Court discretion in a civil ■—
QUESTION:

But the heart of your argument there Is

the need for secrecy,,
MR. GELLER:

The heart of our argument Is that the

District Court under the POIA when a claim under Exemption 5
is raised. Just like in civil discovery, the District Court
must assess the relative benefits to the public of immediate
disclosure — and we are not talking here again about total
non-disclosure, just the delay, a short delay in disclosure against the government’s interest in limited, temporary non­
disclosure.
Now, if that arose in the context of civil litiga­
tion in a suit by Mr. Merrill against the Federal Open Market
Committee, in civil litigation not Involving FOIA, the court
might well decide under Rule 26(c)(2), which allows the
District Court to delay disclosures for short periods of time
not to order the Immediate release of the Domestic Policy
Directive because of the serious government harm that would
ensue

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR Ha KRAMER, ESQ.a
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRa KRAMER:

'Mr. Chief Justice3 and may it please

the Court:
I should like to begin ray presentation by talking

28
about the law of this case and the posture of that law as we
stand here today*
This case has been briefed in three courts and as
a result the issue for decision by this Court, the legal issue
for decision is quite narrow.

We originally wanted the

memoranda of discussion ©f the members of the Federal Open
Market Committee at which the Domestic Policy Directive was
formulated.

We abandoned that demand in the District Court

because we became convinced,, particularly after close examin­
ation of this Court8s opinion in the Sears case, that that
was precisely the type of document that Exemption 5 is de­
signed to protect from disclosure how any agency achieves its
©pin5,on, its order ©r its policy statement is beyond discovery
under the Freedom of Information Act.

But what the order is ,

what the opinion says, and what the policy is is disclosable
and Exemption 5 does not apply to subh tj?pe of document.

QUESTION;

What if at the end of each discussion,

the practice of saying this is subject t© reexamination every
Thursday afternoon at our meeting and until the final day of

MR. KRAMER;

QUESTION:

It isn®t a ruling yet.

By terrast it is

tentative, preliminary, not final, subject to review.

30
MR. KRAMER:

If the Court please, Mr. Chief Justice,

I am saying It would not be available under the first sub­
section of the Act, which directs that all policy statements
be made available, but it might be discoverable9

You couldn't

require the government to publish it, but it might be discover­
able by a citizen asking for It the next day or the next year.
That was all I was talking about.
QUESTION:

Well, the answer would be no decision has

been made, nothing is final, w@ are still talking about it.
MR. KRAMER:

Well, I think that you can obtain under

the Freedom of Information Act lots of papers that do not
constitute final decisions, that was all I was saying.

But It

Isn't our case here, our case here depends solely upon the
concession by the government that this is the policy statement
of the Federal Open Market Committee.
QUESTION:

Well, my hypothetical was aimed at what

the government might do if you prevailed, and —
MR. KRAMER:

I understand, Mr. Chief Justice, and I

want to keep my options open, too.

I don't know what they

are going to do, if Your Honors affirm, as we say.

They might

not have It in writing, and then, of course, the Freedom of
Information wouldn't apply because it only applies to records.
Turning now If I may to the legal posture of the
case, it Is important t© bear in mind that the sole defense in
this Court advanced by this defendant here today is that the

31
Freedom of Information Act permits an agency to defer dis­
closure of a policy statement until that policy is no longer
in effect if disclosure would seriously impair implementation
©f the policyo

And it says* moreover, that the sole basis for

that disclosure is to be found in Exemption 5®
We respectfully disagree with that contention because
we say that this Court in the Sears ease said that Exemption 5
was designed to protect agency deliberations., a kind of
specialised applieation if you will of the doctrine of execu­
tive privilege.
What we seek is the statement in writing of the
policy itself, not how it came to be adopted®
QUESTION:

Mr. Kramer, suppose in a Federal Tort

Claims Act ease which the government is defending, so pre­
sumably it Is not under the law enforcement exemption, the
section chief, after conference with his associates in the
department, sends a letter of instruction to the U.S. Attorney
in the field saying reject the plaintiff9s offer of $50,000,
make a counter offer to him of $35,000 and try to settle for
$40,000.

Now, that decision has been made, the U.S, Attorney

In the field is simply carrying out instructions.

Do you

think a Freedom of Information Act plaintiff could come in
and ask to see a copy of that letter before the settlement
conference was over?
MR. KRAMER:

I dislike not answering questions

32
categorically9 Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc.

The only answer Is that

this case has nothing to do with that type of document»

This

ease —
QUESTION:

It does have something to do with your

insistence that Sears, Roebuck is limited to pre-declaionai
conferences because my hypothesis9 the policy is already
adopted* it simply hasn*t been effectuated.

MR. KRAMER:

My argument is confined to statements

of agency policy* and I am saying that they are not protected
by Exemption 5.

Now* I recognise the difficulty idth Exemption

59 and I am. flattered by these questions but I cannot settle
the meaning of that exemption today.

I can only tell you what

its application is t© government policy statements* and that
is why I am hesitating to answer your question.
Certainly* the statement you refer to would not
have to be published, that is clear.
QUESTION:

But lots of stuff* as you pointed out in

response to the Chief Justice, doesn’t have to be published,
but is nontheless discoverable.
MR. KRAMER:

That’s right.

suggest that Your Honor's question is not a deeply important
one.

ease does not involve addressing that issue.

to think that Congress intended the publication of the kind of

You ere right, sir.

Here is one on

from prompt publication any agency’s policy, not any agency’s
decision on how much it is going to pay for real estate.

QUESTION:

No, a Federal Tort Claims Act suit, as I

38
have always understood it, is civil.
MR, KRAMER:

Yes, not under Exemption 5«

If you

conclude, as I do, hearing Your Honor's description of the
document, that it is a statement of the government’s policy.
Now, my brother in his reply brief makes a distinc­
tion in attempting to distinguish the Sears opinion between
legal policy and economic policy, and he says that the Court,
in writing the Sears case, was thinking of legal policy.

And

he points out and to an exent that it is a play on the word
"direct,” but he does say with some at least partial accuracy
that the Federal Open Market Committee*s policy does not have
a direct impact on an identifiable Individual.
I find that distinction one without a difference.
can imagine no agency policy of any U.S. agency having a
greater impact on the lives of the citizens of this country
than that of the Federal Open Market Committee,

That is the

purpose of their policy statements, to effect the interest

Federal Open Market Committee's

operations or objectives are in the newspapers constantly.
This is a matter that affects the value of the dollar, the
value of the wage earner®® money and the value of the
investor’s accrued savings®

of the case by saying economic policy is to b® distinguished
from legal policy because legal policy refers to specified
Individuals, whereas this is a different type of government

39
activity,
I submit that the argument that is being advanced
here today by the Fed is but a highly camouflaged version of
the argument that was made to withhold records under the Act
that preceded the Freedom of Information Act.

The argument

is that it is contrary to the public interest to release these
documentss and it was the very purpose of these amendments
adopted in 1966, it was their very purpose to get rid of the
public Interest type ©f argument and instead to have more
precise exemptions determine what is to be disclosed and what
is not.
QUESTION?

Well, was their purpose sort of to define

the public interest, isn't that correct?
MR, KRAMER:

That is another way of putting it, yes,

I accept that, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTIONI

Yes, Mr, Justice Powell?

I suggest you answer Mr. Justice Stewart

first and then com® back to me.

I did, yes.
I was going to ask whether Mr. Merrill is

MR. KRAMER:

He is a member of the

bar of the District of Columbia.
QUESTION:
at this time?

What is his Interest in this Information

40
MR9 KRAMER:

1 haven’t asked him because the Act

doesn’t require that I ask him, but I assume that he has no
greater interest than those persons who filed the amicus
brief in this case.
QUESTION:

At the time, of course, he was a student.
Anyone, without rg ard to whatever in-

terest he may have, may bring a cause of action?
MR. KRAMER:

Under my theory of what the Act provides»

yes, Mr. Justice Powell.

All questions of standing and that

sort of thing are out.

MR. KRAMER:

That1 a correct, Your Honor.

By the way

I am not sure — and I want to be very candid about it — I
am not sure even the Court can understand these domestic
policy directives.

There is one In the record beginning at

page 60, and it is very esoteric language.

But I am told that

these words have meaning to monitorists and economists and to
traders in the market and that they will know what they mean
upon reading it at once.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose the Labor Board decides to

order the regional director to file a complaint and they writ©
him a letter and say we talked this all over and our policy
now is so-and-so file

this complaint, is that discoverable?

I mean, that is exempted, isnst it?
MR. KRAMER:

Well, it is certainly not a statement

of policy within the meaning of subsection (a) —
QUESTION:

So your answer is yes, it is within

Exemption 5?
MR. KRAMER:
QUESTION:

1 believe so.
Because it do@sn®t finally dispose of any

thing, it just sets th© government on a course of action,
namely litigation.
MR. KRAMER:
QUESTION:

Precisely.
So if the government adopts — it has a

meeting and it says we are going to embark on a course of
action right now and her© is what we are going to do, we are

42
going to order our open market operator for the next two or
three months to do so and so.

Well, it doesn't finally dis­

pose of any case, it doesn't finally dispose of any course of
action, it is an initiation of a course of action.
MR, KRAMER:

I don't read subeetion (a)(2)(B) in its

phrase ’'statements of policy” to make a distinction between
the type of —
QUESTION:

Whether it Is a misnomer or not, you must

agree that it is an initiation of a course of action by the
government.
MR. KRAMERI
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor —
These are statements of policy, aren’t

they?
MR. KRAMER:

I would prefer to look at the policy

itself.
QUESTION:

I know you do, but I am just asking you

if whatever you look at, doesn't it set the government on a
course of action?
MR, KRAMER:
QUESTION:

Yes, but it —
And it doesn't finish it, It Just starts

it.
MR. KRAMER:

Well, only in the sense that nothing

is ever finished that any agency does, if the Court please,
QUESTION:

Well, I don’t know.

That is just exactly

the line that was drawn in the Sears case which you think was

43
so carefully constructed.
MR. KRAMER:
QUESTION;

Yes, I do.

I dos and I

That Is exactly the line that the
i

opinions that finally dispose of the ease, Ilk® opinions not

to file a complaint, they are discoverable.

But opinions and

statements of policy, if you want to call them that, saying
file, are not discoverable.
MR. KRAMER :

That Is correct. Your Honor, and I, ©f

course, would not be foolish enough not to say, arrogant to
argue with the Court as to the meaning of the opinion.

But I

do want to emphasise that in on® sense every government policy
dictates a course ©f action, that is what a policy statement
is.

So we must look closely I think at; the type of record

that w® are talking about.
And if you will turn to page 65 and look at one of
these policy directives, this is an old one —
QUESTION:

You told me I couldn’t understand it any­

way.
MR. KRAMER:

Well, you couldn’t understand the

details, but you certainly could understand that the board is
saying that this is their policy:

"It is the policy of the

Federal Open Market Committee, while resisting inflationary
pressures" — I am reading at the top of page

6?

— "and

working toward equilibrium in the country9® balance of pay­
ments 9 to foster financial conditions conducive to cushioning

recessionary tendencies and stimulating economic recovery."
QUESTION:

That sounds like a statement from the

White House Press Office»
(Laughter)
MR. KRAMER:

Wellf it may well be.

The Fed, of

courseg is an independent agency with great powers not to©
dissimilar from those of the Chief Executive9 but it certainly
is a statement ©f policy on which future action is based.
QUESTION:

Are you claiming only under subsection

(2) here rather than under subsection (3) ae well?

Are you

claiming that this is discoverable because it is a statement
of policy or are you claiming that it is a record which an
agency has a copy of?
MR. KRAMERi

It is both.

We are claiming under

bothg that we could have — if a citisen or person asks for
"''"'it* it must be produced.
QUESTION:

It wouldn't have to be a statement of

policy to come under (3)* would it?
MR. KRAMER:
QUESTION?
MR. KRAMER:

That is correct, four Honor* precisely.
But they are both subject to Exemption 5?
Absolutely, sir.

Absolutely.

And it

is our position that any statement of an agency policy which
dictates future conduct by the agency

cannot be exempt under

5@ although it may be under 13 2g 3S or 7,
Nowg if the Court please, I want to perhaps reiterate

but emphasise that If this Court agrees that we must deter­
mine whether publication of a policy promptly would impair
an agency’s Implementation of that policy, that we will then
have to have the ease remanded for trial below.

You have the

experts whose opinions have been cited on the one side, and
you have the Fed people very sincerely on the other*
And It Is a matter 1 should think of great serious­
ness I suppose that we will introduce under the Freedom of
Information Act a trial in District Courts every time an
agency makes a claim that prompt publication of its policies
will impede Implementation, because the other side, the

MR. KRAMER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor* and the other aide
Doesn’t that require a fair — that is

going to require some litigation.
MR. KRAMER:
QUESTION:

I don’t think so.

They haven’t —

You don’t have a lawsuit the way you

would normally have so the District Court could say a snap
judgment* I know enough about this lawsuit, it is burdensome*
I won't require it, it Is not burdensome, I will require it.
He has got to almost hypothicate a lawsuit with the same sort
of facts that you say would have to go back for trial.
MR. KRAMERs

Not quite. Your Honor.

I was referring

to the broad issues of the type cited in each side's brief in
this ease9 in which their experts said would impede effective
market regulation, that our experts said would make for a
better market to publish promptly, and so on.
QUESTION?

Is your situation different from the on®

hypothesized by Mr. Justice Hehnquist in that in a lawsuit
there is a reason for trying to get information, or presumably
there is a reasons you don’t spin your wheels trying to get
irrelevant information.

Here you have already said that it

is just idle curiosity that ia enough to get the information.
MR. KRAMERs

Oh, no.

I said that was the law, but

I didn’t say that ©ur curiosity was idle.

QUESTION:

I know* but not that yours, except present

company, but Idle curiosity Is enough to support the claim by
all other claimants.
MR. KRAMER:

Yea, I would assume, however, that

people who file PIOA lawsuits for reasons of idle curiosity
would not be able to man the type of offensive hearing that
would be required if th© government’s test, the committee’s
test in this case is adopted, because, you see, their test
is not absolute that they can defer willy-nilly until a policy
is no longer In effects

Their test is that If It will impa.tr

the implementation of the policy, and that they have to prove
if it is relevant.

They have never had a chance to prove

that because the District Court and the Court of Appeals said
that Is irrelevant*

But If it is relevant, I would assume

that we are not out of court, we go back to the District Court
for a trial of some kind on that issue in which there will
be a battle of experts, I can assure this Court, theirs
against ours.
It just strikes m® as when you contemplate that as
a solution, it seems to achieve a result which could not have
been Intended and certainly is not one of the objectives of
the Freedom of Information Act.
If the Court please, the Act in some respects is
fast achieving an importance, that is part of the Act, akin
to some constitutional provisions.

And one of the cardinal

48
principles of the Act as we read it is that all government
policy statements9 all agency policy statements not specific­
ally exempted by the Act are to be promptly published*

And

If the Court please9 it seems to me that is a very good
doctrine.

It seems to me that In a democratic society that

the notion that people governed have a right to know what the
policies of the agencies governing them are9 is a reasonable
doctrine and a good doctrine

„
