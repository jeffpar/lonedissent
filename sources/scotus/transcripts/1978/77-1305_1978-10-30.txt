PROCEEDINGS

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 77-1305» Parklane Hosiery Company against Shore.
Mr. Levitt» you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK B. LEVITT» ESQ.»
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEVITT:

Mr. Chief Justice» and may it please

the Court:
The principal issue presented in this appeal is
whether a litigant loses his constitutional right to a trial
jury by estoppel when the issue to be decided has been adjudi­
cated adversely to him in a prior SEC injunction action» at
which there was no right to a trial by jury and in which his
present adversary was not a party.
The facts are these.

Parklane Hosiery effected a

going-private transaction in October 197^ by means of a merger
in which a proxy was issued to its shareholders.

A month

later» in November e74» thi-s class action was commenced on
behalf of all the stockholders of the corporation» except
those who had exercised their statutory dissenters' rights.
The class action proceeded to a class certification
and to commencement of discovery.

In May 1976» a year and a

half after the class action had been begun and after the
merger had been accomplished» the SEC» under the authority
of Section 21 of the 193^ Exchange Act authorizing injunction

4
actions, commenced an action for an injunction and other
relief, alleging as its grounds certain claimed material misrepresentations and omissions by Parklane in its proxy state­
ment o
Two weeks after the SEC started its independent
action, the Respondents here — the Plaintiffs in the class
action — moved to amend their complaint so as to precisely
track, to fall in behind the allegations of the SEC Injunction
complaint.
Pursuant to rules which permit the prompt trial of
SEC Injunction actions, the Si£C injunction came on to be tried
about one month after it was commenced, in June of 1976, and
while the class action here was in an early stage of discovery.
After trial in September 876, the district Judge who
had heard the SEC injunction proceeding found that Parklane
had violated the securities laws in the three precise respects
that the SEC had alleged, the three material ©missions or mis­
representations,

But the district judge denied the injunction

which was the root remedy that the SEC had requested, on the
ground that there was no basis for an injunction, that the
merger had long since been accomplished, that there was no
evidence and not even a contention, as I understand it, that
there was any on-going conduct that would suggest a concern,
a public concern, for continuing wrongs or violations in the
Securities laws

5
Just after the judgment in the SEC proceeding* in
November.* I believe* 1976* Respondent here moved for partial
summary judgment on the issues which had been adjudicated in
the SEC non-jury injunction proceeding* on the theory that
because the SEC injunction proceeding had included similar
issues of fact* the Petitioner here was collaterally here
estopped from relitigating those issues.
QUESTION:

You say "similar."

Are they more than

similar?
MR. LEVITT:

They are precisely the same* Mr. Justice

Burger* as the issues contained in the amended complaint* or
embraced in the amendment.

There were some other claims in

the class action and* of course* there would be other Issues*
at least including damages* still for trial.

That's the

sense in which there was a motion for partial summary judgment.
But to answer what I believe is the purport of your
question* Mr. Chief Justice* yes* the request for partial
summary judgment was coextensive with the findings of viola­
tion that had occurred in the SEC proceeding.
The District Court denied the motion for partial
summary judgment in a short decision* motion denied* and
relying on the Fifth Circuit decision in Rachal v. Hill* a
1970 Fifth Circuit decision.
On appeal* the Second Circuit Court of Appeals re­
versed the District Court* directed the entry of the summary

judgment which had been requested and*, in effect* determined
that the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel*
in this instance* ought to extinguish the right to a trial
jury that the Petitioner* otherwise* concededly* would have
had.
This appeal presents to the Court* for the first
time since this Court's decision in Blonder-Tongue* a question
of the proper reach and application of the doctrine of col­
lateral estoppel in the absence of mutuality*
And Petitioners contend here* very briefly* that the
test* the historical inquiry* as to the law in 1791 as a basis
for determining the scope and limits of Seventh Amendment jury
trial rights* if applied in accordance with what we contend is
a fairly straightforward following of the cases of this Court*
Dimick va Schiedt and very recently Curtis v* Lother and others
demonstrate that Respondent couldn't have been estopped col­
laterally from a jury trial

of his defenses in 1791 or* indeed

until the very recent relaxation of the mutuality of estoppel
rule* and can't now be so estopped,,
We believe also that that result Is squarely con­
sistent with this Court's decisions ;Ln Beacon Theatres*
Dairy Queen and other cases* and that the Rachal decision* the
Fifth Circuit decision in 1970* which until this case was the
only case which presented an interface or a challenge to the
Seventh Amendment by the new concept of nonmutual estoppel*

7
which had held fco the contrary that a jury trial could not
be extinguished by this mechanism* quite properly analyzed
the law and this Court's decisions on the issue»
And,, finally* we will contend that this Court's re­
fusal* for which* of course* we shall contend* fco apply col­
lateral estoppel in the circumstances presented in this case
would be wholly consistent with the Blonder-Tongue principle
that nonmutual estoppel* even if the formal elements may be
present* should not be applied where justice and equity dic­
tate otherwise.
Now* Your Honors* before analysis or reference to
the decision in the court below* I'll briefly summarize to you
the Fifth Circuit decision in Rachal„

There the SEC had sought

and obtained an injunction against corporate behavior in a
Securities Law violation context.

Thereafter* a class action

had been begun* and the class action plaintiffs* using the
SEC judgment as its predicate* sought summary judgment* much
as it is being attempted In this case.

There* the Fifth

Circuit squarely held that collateral estoppel may not be
applied so as to deny a Seventh Amendment jury trial right.
And* in so doing* the Court confronted the challenge of the
Seventh Amendment in the face of this relatively new procedural
mechanism* and acknowledged also that the change in the rules
of mutuality still then emerging -- and 1 believe still now
emerging — but noted that the rule should not apply where

8
overriding issues of fairness dictate otherwise.
The Rachal court; the Fifth Circuit court, analyzed
this Court’s decision in Beacon Theatres, referred to the great
respect which its language and its decision showed to the pre­
eminence of the Seventh Amendment In the face of changing pro­
cedural mechanisms, in that case the Federal Rules, and found
that the Beacon decision led inevitably to denial of estoppel.
Turning to the decision in the Second Circuit, the
court below -•»
QUESTION:

B1 onder-Tongue, of course, involved the

validity val non of a patent, didn’t it?
MRo LEVITT:
QUESTION:

It did,
Let’s assume that a patent was held to

be invalid in the Second Circuit, and then in the Third
Circuit -- and that had been done in a non-jury trial because
nobody had asked for a jury -- and then in the Third Circuit
the issue of that same patent's validity was raised in litiga­
tion and the person asserting the validity of the patent said,
"Well, I want a jury trial on this issue,"

Does that mean

that collateral estoppel just could not possibly prevail be­
cause of the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial?
MR, LEVITT:

I don't think so, Your Honor,

I believe?

in all events,that in the Blonder-Tongue contest there was no
jury trial question raised and moreover -QUESTION:

In my case there is.

In the hypothetical

9
case embodied in my question, there is a jury trial question
raised®

The original determination of invalidity was made in

a non»jury trial®

Now the same issue is raised in a different

circuit, involving the validity of the same patent, and the
person asserting its validity says, "I want a jury trial,"
and there cannot possibly be collateral estoppel because there
wasn't a jury trial in the other case®
MR® LEVITT:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think —

Addressing myself to the question, as I understand it, the
person seeking to avoid estoppel in the second case that you
put would, in all events, be entitled to a trial®

The question

is whether the party who had litigated the case earlier

in

the B1ender-Tongue case, the alleged patent holder who had
initiated the litigation and who in the litigation which he
had initiated was met with the finding of invalidity of his
own patent®

And Blonder-Tongue said being confronted with

a determination adverse to you in a case which you initiated,
you can't now proceed to attempt to enforce against anybody.
QUESTION:

What difference does it make as to who

initiated the case, in terms of the legal principles involved?
MR. LEVITT:

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor —
You mean the choice of jury waiver would

be one, I suppose.
MR. LEVITT:

It would and, Your Honor, as I think

we will see in the context of this case, it is not at all

10

essential to the disposition of this case»

I would comment

upon your question to say that there has been much writing and
speculation about the distinction* if any* and the weight which
ought to be accorded to it* between the so-called defensive
use of mutual estoppel and the so-called offensive use*

I say

so-called because many people contend* perhaps with seme
force* that there isn't a profound or a structural distinction
between the two.

I don't think it at all affects the line

of reasoning or the ultimate decision by this Court in this
case.
I would say* however* in response to your question*
that I find some concern in the issue of whether -- I find a
somewhat different standard* a somewhat different test* prob­
ably in order in considering whether a subsequent litigant can
exploit a successful litigation by a predecessor and follow it
by attempting to get summary judgment* attempting to get judg­
ment almost by hypothesis* on the basis of that earlier adjudi­
cation.
I would be concerned about many factors affecting the
earlier adjudication and its

implication for the party who

had not been a party to it and who is now faced with confronta­
tion of the same issue.
Your Honor* returning* if I may* to the decision
below.

The Second Circuit* in reversing* held exactly to the

contrary of Rachal.

It found that collateral estoppel would

11
apply undisputedly, except for the jury trial issue.

It

reasoned, or at least It discovered —
QUESTION;

Mr, Levitt, I am sorry to go back to

Justice Stewart's question.

I am not entirely sure I under­

stand your answer.
Is your answer that there is a difference between
defensive and offensive use of mutual estoppel?

I thought

you said you didn't think there was.
MR. LEVITT;
QUESTION:

In my judgment, sir, there should be.
There should be.

But is it not correct

that unless we draw that distinction, B1onder-Tongue decides
this case?
MR, LEVITT:
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR, LEVITT:
reasons.

First

I don't think so, sir.

I don't think so, sir, for several

Your Honor, let me address myself to your

question in the following fashion.
I believe that the offensive -— the so-called
offensive use ««* and this case, to my knowledge, as well as
the Rachal case in the Fifth Circuit, presents the first such
proposition for it -- deserves a different test.

I do not

think, Your Honor, that it will be crucial,by almost any line
of reasoning, to Your Honors' decision, because I think this
case will more than likely be presented primarily on the issue
of its Seventh Amendment implication.

But I do believe that

12

the level of examination, the concern about who was involved
in the prior adjudication and what were the implications of
the circumstances of that prior adjudication for the parties
sought to be estopped by it in the second action and who was
innocent of — that is to say who was innocent of any parfcicipation in the earlier action — probably should be a higher
standard and should be a matter of concern»
To try and follow that for what use I believe it
may have for the facts in this case — I think the fact that
the prior adjudication was an SEC injunction proceeding* for
example, is one which ought to weigh in the balance of whether
or not it ought to estop the subsequent party»
For example, Mr. Justice Stevens, in the relatively
few cases, compared to the much i^riting and comment on fche
subject, cited in Respondent's brief for the application of
offensive, so-called, use of estoppel, I find only three in
which offensive use was actually applied.

And I find there

that in each of those three cases the party in whose shoes, so
to speak, fche new litigant finds himself, wag a party of
exactly identical rank and interest, so to speak, in fche liti­
gation of that issue, as was fche later party sought to be
estopped.
For example, fche three cases that 1 can recall are
a co-passenger in a taxicab, both innocent, both victimized,
a full and fair opportunity, a jury trial right In the firofc

13

action* ergo* offensive estoppel»

I do not find* apart from

matters of legal analysis — my sense of justice isn’t
troubled by that»
A co-passenger in an airplane* a mortgagee versus a
mortgagor sucessively suing an insurance carrier* arising out
of the same casualty.

Where the Implication and the facts are

strong that the litigant to the earlier case had the same
kinds of concern* the same view of the litigation as could be
presumed to be that of the party to the second litigation who
was sought to be estopped.
QUESTION:

Isn’t that only relevant where there is

adequate motivation to go all out in making a complete defense?
MR. LEVITT:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Wouldn’t your client have had the same

motivation to defend against the Securities and jgxchange
Commission as he does in the damage -MR. LEVITT:

Your Honor* I don’t think it is only a

matter of motivation.

I think it is a matter of many factors

which inhere in a litigant’s view of what the significance and
implications of a litigation are to him.
To answer your question* no* I don’t think his motiva­
tion would have been less to defend as it would to defend a
private party action.
QUESTION:

But there is* I suppose* a difference

between the hypothetical case embodied in my question and those

14

three cases that you just mentioned to us»

And the conclusion

implicit in Mr, Justice Stevens 8 question is that here there
was no — you couldn't have had a jury trial in the first
action* no matter how hard you tried»
MR, LEVITT

Right,

The structure of the earlier

adjudication was
QUESTION:
MR, LEVITT:

You simply had no right to a jury trial»
Number one* there was no right to a

jury trial* because the statute evidencing a policy very well
expressed In the Government’s amicus brief here* that the SEC
was authorized by the Government to move quickly and flexibly
to enjoin on-going wrongs.

And* therefore* there should be no

jury classic equity jurisdiction and no jury trial right.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't this be equally true of any

equity case in a court* as distinguished from a regulatory
agency?
MR„ LEVITT:

No* Your Honor* I don’t think so*

because of the implications for most civil litigation of the
Federal Rules,

And that* in fact* relates us precisely to the

Beacon Theatres case* which is the heart of what the Second and
the Fifth Circuit seem to have bean arguing about,
QUESTION:
MR, LEVITT:
QUESTION:

I perhaps didn’t make my question clear.
I am sorry* Mr. Chief Justice,
No jury in an SEC case -- not even a

discretionary power* I suspect* on the part of SEC to call a

15
jury In —
MR, LEVITT:

Correct,

QUESTION: — An equity judge could* conceivably* have
the power* on some factual question — unusual* but he could
call in a jury and submit certain questions* couldn't he?
Possibly?
MR, LEVITT:
QUESTION:

Possibly* yes,
It's been done.

what's the basic difference?

It Isn't the normal* but

If the case is t-rlgS to judgment

in the equity court with no jury and the case is tried to a
determination In the SEC with no jury* why do you distinguish
those two?
MR, LEVITT:

Let me tell you why I do.

Because I

think that distinction goes very much to the heart of the issue
presented here.
Beacon Theatres* which was interpreted in a precisely
contrary manner by the Fifth Circuit and the Second Circuit
— Beacon Theatres said that in the face of the Federal Rules
which* in terms of the merger of law and equity* presented both
what used to be equitable and legal disputes in the same civil
action* the Seventh Amendment with its command to continue to
preserve jury trial rights* in the sense that they have been
entitled to preservation historically and in accordance with
the long line of this Court's cases* compels that any issues of
fact in what would otherwise be a mixed legal and equitable case*

16

under the Federal Rules* must needs be tried by a jury* and
that to try such issues of fact before an equity court would
violate the mandate of the Seventh Amendment and the consti­
tutional right of the litigant to advance the traditional
common law claima
And for that reason* Your Honor -« and I hope I am
being responsive to your question — for that reason* I would
say to you that in the law under Beacon Theatres* under Dairy
Queen and under Meeker v„ Ambassador 011» all cited and dis­
cussed in the brief* the law is clear that where there are
issues of fact which are in aid of equitable claims and of
legal claims* you may not extinguish the jury right created
by those legal claims by a prior adjudication in equity.
That is the fair and*I believe*inevitable inter­
pretation of Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen.

And I might say

in that connection that the Second Circuit found a rather
unusually narrow interpretation of Beacon Theatresc

It said*

/

in substance* and 1 hope I am not exaggerating* for the purpose
of illuminating the Second Circuit's view -- It said in sub­
stance* Beacon Theatres was merely a scheduling case.

It con­

cerned itself with how issues ought to be ordered* and that's
why it came up in a mandamus context*so that the District
Court would have the proper direction.
Both the Rachal court in the Fifth Circuit and* I
believe* the plainest kind of reading of Justice Black's

17

opinion for the majority, don't at all admit of that narrow
construction»

To us and to the Fifth Circuit it was a very

ringing affirmation of Seventh Amendment rights, when con­
fronted by the new structure of litigation imposed by the
Federal Rules»
QUESTION:

But, isn’t it true that the whole pre­

supposition of Beacon Theatres was that if the equity case
were tried first it would be res judicata?
MR, LEVITT:

No, Your Honor»

That certainly is the

interpretation —
QUESTION:

As you know, I dissented in that case,

so I perhaps don’t understand It as well as you doe
MRo LEVITT:

With the greatest respect, Mr» Justice

Stewart, let me tell you why I think not»

I think not because

there is one sentence in Justice Black's decision for the
majority which at least the Second Circuit turned to — or it
was the only one which we could find which could be argued to
have supported the proposition that if ordered pre-litigation
of jury issues as a one-haIf of a two-sided coin of permitting
estoppel, if the order tvhich the Supreme Court mandated were
not followed.
Justice Black made one comment in Beacon Theatres
and that was in the context of characterizing the circuit
court below concerns, as expressed by the circuit court -and Justice Black characterized it, at least in substance by

18

saying there is some concern expressed that if the equitable
Issues were tried first* why then an estoppel might follow
with the legal issues»
But * Mr* Justice Stewart* 2 would suggest to you
that our reading cf Meeker v« Ambassador Oil leads us to con­
clude that the intention of Beacon Theatres was rather
broader than that.
In Meeker* there was no mandamus.

The District

Court did not get the benefit of early warning about the
order in which the Seventh Amendment preferred the issues
to be tried* and the District Court, without the benefit of
that, went ahead, where both legal and equitable relief was
granted and ordered the equitable Issues tried first before
a court and without a jury.

They were tried firstj adversely

to the jury claimant, the District Court found that in con­
sequence, there was nothing to decide in the legal action
because it was dependent on the premise of fact which was
inherent in the equitable action.

The case came to the United

States Supreme Court, I believe, in 1963, and this Court re­
versed memorandum, decision reversed, citing Beacon Theatres
and Dairy Queen, remanded the case.

And our inquiry tells us,

as is revealed in the brief, that the case went back and it
was directed to be retried with the jury issues tried first.
The order -- not which by mandamus — but reflects a preference
of this Court ■— but with the greatest respect, the order which

19

we believe Justice Blacky for the majority in Beacon directed
that be held, and that the reciprocal consequence, far from
being s permitted estoppel, is a retrial or an assertion of
the Seventh Amendment mandate by a new trial, so that the
Seventh Amendment, not by happenstance of a court's improper
ordering of issues, be vitiated or be lost in the bargain.
To that issue also, Justice Black in Beacon Theatres
— the case argued to be limited merely to a scheduling

of

cases, stated, "A jury right cannot, through prior determina­
tion of equitable claims” — "A jury right" -« forgive me —
"cannot be lost through prior determination of equitable claims
except under the most imperative circumstances," which in view
of flexible procedures of the Federal Rules, Justice Black
could not even anticipate happening.
Now, relating these arguments and relating this
foceral interpretation of Beacon Theatres to the matter at
hand, we argue, as precisely as the Fifth Circuit found in
Raohal, that what the Second Circuit here has done is a
complete anomaly, because an SEC Injunction, by statute, you
cannot consolidate them with private casesi ergo, the issue
cannot be presented to the court in a precisely Beacon
Theatres contexta

that is to say consolidated cases, pre­

senting the question of the order of trial of legal and
equitable issues, because the 1932* Exchange Act prohibits a
jury trial.

20

And the Fifth Circuit in Rachal said how is it
possible that if these cases were consolidated for trial
there is no way that the jury trial could have had to wait
for the equitable trial or would have been bound by a result
of an equitable trial.

It is anomalous, the Fifth Circuit

found, that the party who was not in the original adjudication,
but the Respondent in this case, could, in effect, get a bene»
fit of a pre~litigation, without jury, that he could not have
had if the case were presented in the Beacon Theatres context.
Any other interpretation, I think, would do the
greatest offense to the Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen
doctrines,
We contend also — and the briefs demonstrate the
line of reasoning, I think, quite simply — that the traditional
line of inquiry of whether a Seventh Amendment right concededly heretofore existed can be vitiated or lost.

And that

is the standard historical inquiry about what the state of the
lax*? as to jury rights was in 1791* can be applied in this
Instance, that the cases which were cited in the brief demon­
strate the very simple sequence that there was no such thing
as estoppel which could have extinguished! the jury tr5.al right,
not only in 1791 but until 25 or 30 years ago, that this action
is an action within the protection of the Seventh Amendment
on the authority of this Court’s decisions and that the
introduction of a new procedural mechanism cannot be employed

21

to vitiate that Seventh Amendment right.

If there must be

an accommodation* as Justice Black found there must be with
the merger provisions of the Federal Rules* the new procedure
must accommodate to the Seventh Amendment.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Mr. Rosen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL K. ROSEN, ESQ»*
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RQiEN:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
We respectfully submit that Beacon Theatres is
precisely a scheduling question.

The issue presented in

Beacon Theatres is when a court has before it both legal and
equitable claims it must have the Jury decide the legal claims
first.

Otherwise* there would be a preclusive effect of the

determination of the equitable claims by the court* which would
make it impossible for those claims to be heard by the Jury.
This is consistent with the common law in 1791* when the
Seventh Amendment was adopted* in that a decree in equity
between two parties in 1791 was preclusive on a subsequent
legal action between those two parties.

There is no anomaly

in finding that the equitable action will preclude the re­
litigation of the issues in a legal action.
QUESTION:

But you have to parlay that together with

the nonmutuality doctrine* which did not exist in 1791* don't

22
you* in order fco make your case cone out all right?
MR, ROSEN:

Precisely* Your Honor.

There are two —

It is a two-horse parlay»
QUESTION:

And you’ve got to win both of them»

MRe ROSEN:

‘That's correct»

QUESTION:
MR, ROSEN:

I think —

And yon have so far»
I think Blonder-Tongue has already been

won,
QUESTION:

Your point is you won each of them and

now you are just combining them,
.MR, ROSEN:
QUESTION:

That's right,
You haven't won each of them.

been won by your predecessor.

They have

And now you seek to combine the

two victories,
MR, ROSEN:

There is no deprivation of the jury

trial right in this action.

The defendants are going to have

a jury trial in this action on all the issues not determined
in the SEC action,
QUESTION:

Is the claim in this case on collateral

estoppel that the prior litigation determines not only the
factual issues that were raised and decided* but a legal issue*
too?
MR, ROSEN:

In the SEC action* the District Court

and the Court of Appeals*affirming unanimously* found that
there were material misstatements in the subject proxy

23

statement.
QUESTION:
MR. ROSEN;

And a violation of the statute?
And a violation of the statute* that's

correct.
Collateral estoppel relating to factual issues* we
have moved for summary judgment only on the factual issue that
there is — that there were material misstatements in the proxy
statement.
QUESTION:

Do you think that is purely a factual

question?
MR, ROSEN:

It is a mixed question of fact in law.

QUESTION:

So* collateral estoppel reaches that far*

at least* you think?
MR0 ROSEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Not just historical facts* but seme

characterization of them* in terms of the statute?
MR. ROSEN:

Yes* I believe it does* Your Honor* but

even if it doesn’t* there would be a preclusion of the relitigation of the question of whether there are material mis­
statements and omissions in the proxy statement.
QUESTION:

There would be preclusion as to whether

these particular statements had been made.
MR. ROSEN:

It is more than that* Your Honor.

The

fact that they are misleading and that they are not correct.
QUESTION:

You mean misleading within the meaning of

24

the statute* or not?
MR, ROSEN;

Yes* I mean misleading to the public

shareholders of the company* that they thought* for example*
that one of the findings of misleading statement was that
there were no negotiations going on with the Federal Reserve
Bank as to the negotiations to buy out a leasehold of Parklane.
QUESTION:

Do you think your motion for summary

judgment* that you Just described in response to Justice
White’s question* should have been granted by a court before
Blonder-Tongue was decided and while Triplet was still the law?
MR, ROSEN:

Your Honor* there has beenran erosion of

the doctrine of mutuality.

In the Second Circuit* at least*

in 1964 —
QUESTION:

Suppose you deal just with cases from

this Court* since* I* for one* certainly don’t pretend to be
familiar with all the Court of Appeals cases.
MR. ROSEN:

I would think that before Blonder-

Tongue that this Court did not approve the mutuality -required mutuality -QUESTION:

So* you then rely on Blonder-Tongue

outside of the patent area and as a virtually absolute rule
to justify summary judgment?
QUESTION:
MR, ROSEN:

And offensive as well as defensive.
Yes* I do.

Blonder-Tongue has been followed in a number of cases

25

in a number of circuits since it was decided in 1970c

It has
i

been followed, for example -« It has been followed and
mutuality has been permitted — nonmutuality has been permitted
in an cffenselve manner in the Seventh Circuit, in the Second
Circuit and in the Sixth Circuit, all cases decided subsequent
to Blonder-Tongue.

And, in fact, Rachal y, Hill, the Fifth

Circuit case?* was decided before the Blonder-Tongue decision.
So, it is not clear to me how the Fifth Circuit would have
decided Rachal v, Hills had Blonder-Tongue been decided prior
to its decision in the Rachal case»
I think that offensive use of collateral estoppel
should be permitted in this case, because at all times during
the pendency of the SEC action the Defendants were aware of
the existence of the private action, the Parklane v,
Shore action.

That also differentiates this case from the

Rachal case, because in Rachal the private action was begun
after the SEC action was begun,
QUESTION:

What could they have done in order to

obtain a right to jury trial in the private action in this
case?
MR, ROSEN:

They could have sought to expedite the

private action instead of, for example, spending seven months
aicer ohe complaint was filed to answer the complaint.
complaint xvas filed in November of 1974, the answer was,
I believe in June of 1975.

The

26
QUESTION;

But* ordinarily* the SEC action will have

a priority that a private action won't.
MR. ROSEN:

Unless the private action is ready for

trial* prior to the time that the SEC action is brought* that’s
correct* the SEC will -« whichever case is ready first.

If

the SEC case is ready first* the SEC trial will be held first.
If the private action is ready first* it will have its jury
trial first.

But* in this case* the Defendant had -- They

were aware that the SEC was investigating the transaction.
At the same time* they were aware of the existence of this
action.

If they wanted a jury trial in this action* they

could have answered the complaint* not in seven months* but in
two months* or whatever time they might have been able to get
their answer together.
QUESTION:

They could have —

You can require them to answer in 20

days* can’t you?
MR» ROEEN:

As a matter of courtesy between

attorneys — When I was constantly being asked for threeweek adjournments* four-week adjournments* on the answer it
seemed to me if they want three weeks they can have three
weeks.

But it is not I who is now complaining about the loss

of a jury trial.

It is they who* having taken the strategic

moves that they did in delaying answering and delaying deposi­
tions* it is they who are now complaining that that has caused
them to lose a jury trial* right* because the SEC case was

27

heard before this case*
QUESTION:

How far do you carry this particular rule*;

VJhafc if in the SEC action the finding had been in favor of the
company*

and then you brought this suit?
MR* RCfcjEN:

Well* under the doctrine of collateral

estoppel* we — there would have been no right to collateral
estoppel on the part of the company against —
QUESTION.*

There have been findings in its favor on

the same issue in another case*
MR» ROSEN:
court.

But we would not have had our day in

The difference between that case and the case here

presented is the company has already had its day in court.
There has been a full and fair adjudication of the issues.

They

don’t deny that there has been a full and fair adjudication
of the issues.

There was a four-day trial.

There was an

appeal in the SEC action and the decision.of the judge was
affirmed unanimously by the Second Circuit.
QUESTION: But if that is the case* isn’t this
invariably going to give the private plaintiff two bites at
the apple.

He can just hold back until after the Government's

case is tried.

If the Government wins* he wins.

If the

Government loses* he gets his second bite at the apple.
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION:

If the Government loses -If the Government loses its case* the

private plaintiff* by your answer to Justice White* isn't

28
bound-

He has his own day in court-

And if the Government

wins* he simply hitches his cart onto the Government’s victory-

MR- RCSEN:. Well* as to the second part of your
question, I believe one of the purposes of the Securities and
JEkchange Commission is to act to protect the public-

So that,

to the extent that they win in an action against a private
corporation* the public shareholders ought to be entitled to
hitch their wagon to the star of the SEC's action.
QUESTION:

Take the Antitrust Statute* where* as I

recall* there is a provision that in certain circumstances
— this is by Act of Congress -- judgment in favor of the
Government can be used as a prima facie case.

Now* there is

nothing in the Securities Act like that, is there?
MR. ROSEN:

That's correct* Your Honor.

But what

v/e have is a situation where,it seems to me, that in the
Antitrust context Congress is limiting whatever collateral
estoppel effect there might be to an antitrust action brought
bv the Government in the private action.
QUESTION:

But, don't you think the intent of

Congress in passing that Antitrust Act was to give private
plaintiff's a benefit, rather than a detriment?
MR„ ROSEN:

It may have been at the time to give

than a benefit, and to the extent that it was meant to give
them a benefit, if there were a question -- If there is a
question of a violation of the Seventh Amendment, in this

29

action, it seems to me there is also a question of a violation
of the Seventh Amendment with respect to the Antitrust Act,
which renders prima facie effect —
QUESTION;

That still leaves it up to the jury.

You wouldn't preclude

You wouldn't want a directed verdict

on the particular facts in this issue —>
MR. ROSEN;

Mr* Justice White* if I may* by rendering,

prima facie effect to the decision in the antitrust action*
if neither side presents any evidence at that point* in a
private action vjhich is based on a Government action* brought
against the same defendant* the plaintiff will win in the
private action; whereas* if there were no prima facie effect
given to the decision in the Government action* there would
be -- the defendant would have won the case* since the private
plaintiff would not have met his burden of proof.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rosen* that's no answer* because

if there is a jury sitting there and the defendant wants to
put in evidence* he can do so.

He has a right to present the

Issue to the jury in the antitrust context.
MR, RCyEN:

That's correct* Your Honor,

I am just

suggesting —» I am not suggesting that he doesn't have
QUESTION:

-«

It seems to me that your position

effectively -- It either treats antitrust cases other than
Government litiga;ion* or else it goes farther than Section 5
of the Clayton Af t* and says? instead of being prima facie

effect, it is conclusive effect, even asking us to add to
what Congress granted the plaint if f0
MR, ROSEN;

When Congress passed the Clayton Act,

the question of mutuality — mutuality was still a requirement.
QUESTION: The law has developed since then.

But

if the law has developed, presumably all we have done is
made this statute obsolete*
plaintiffs don't need it.
MR. ROSEN:
QUESTION:

We don't need it any more*

The

That must be your view, isn't it?

That is my view, Your Honor.
So, you think antitrust actions, prior

decrees won’t just be prima facie, but they will bind now?
MR. ROSEN:

I don't think so, because —-

QUESTION:

I thought you just said that to

Mr. Justice Stevens.
MR. ROSEN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I am

thinking It through now, if I may.
QUESTION:

You don't want to say now that the

statute Is obsolete.
MR. ROSEN:

The statute may be obsolete, but it

Is still the only Congressional mandate that the Court has
to follow in determining what effect in a private action the
decision in a Government antitrust action should have.
It may be that the antitrust action should be treated
differently.

I don't know.

QUESTION:

You mean as long as that statute is on

31

the books* BIonder-Tongue doesn't apply?
MR. ROSEN:

It does not appear to apply to anti­

trust actions* that Is correct.
QUESTION:

Why shouldn't we take it, though* as a

legislative policy position* with respect to what prior
Government decrees generally should stand for in later liti­
gation

'■

MR. RG8EN:

Because it is not part of the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934.

And Congress in passing the Securities

£&change Act in 193^ knew that it could have put in such a
provision* having done it in the Clayton Act.
QUESTION:

I know* but at that point they would have

wanted to give plaintiff some benefits* because then there
was a mutuality requirement,
QUESTION:

That section of the Clayton Act has

been amended three times since the B1onder-Tongue decision*
197^# 1976 and 19 ~~

So »- without changing the prima facie

ef f ec t,
MR. ROSEN:

Perhaps Congress intended there to be

a special rule for antitrust action.
QUESTION:

It could be the reason.

I think each of those amendments was

designed to help plaintiffs in antitrust cases,
QUESTION:

Mr. Rosen* I didn't understand whether

or not you conceded the correctness of my brother* Rahnquistte
assumption in his question to you that the plaintiff gets two

32
bites at the apple*

If the Government loses* the plaintiff

can still try his case

If the Government loses in the SSC

case — If the EEC loses* then the private plaintiff* the
shareholder* can still try his case* de novo* without any
effect of that prior determination.
MR, RQ&EN:
QUESTION:

Is that correct?

That is correct* Your Honor,
Let us say* in the SEC case* that the

court had found as a fact that there were no material misstatements.

Now* wouldn’t that be of benefit to the defendant

In your lawsuit?
MR, RC8EN:

We are going to have a problem* whichever

way the case is decided* because if they decide for the
|

defendant in this action* the defendant will have two bites
of the apple.

We are dealing with a situation where there

will either be two trials —
QUESTION:

To get back to my question* why wouldn’t

the defendant be able to use that determination in the prior
lawsuit* if there were no material misstatements in this
proxy material?
MR. RGfcjEN: Because the plaintiff would not have had
a day in court* not had a chance to present his witnesses
j

who the SEC might not have called.

There may be facts which

are available to the private party of which the SEG may not have
been aware*

where* if there is collateral estoppel effect

given against the defendant* he would have already put his

33
own case on*
all the facts»

He would have put on all his witnesses* presented
He would have had his day in court and pre­

sented as full a trial and as full a record to the court as
^

he would put on in the second case»

That's the distinction

between the two cases»
QUESTION;

I was correct in my apprehension that

you conceded the correctness of the proposition implicit in
ray brother# Rehnquist’s question»
MR» ROSEN:

Yes# sir»

This Court has recognized as recently as 1966 in
the Katehen v. Landy case# that a decision in an equity action
against one party will have preclusive effect against that
I

party in a subsequent legal action»

In that case# in the

first action# there was no right to a jury trial»

In the

second action# were it; not for the first action# there would
have been a right to a jury trial»
1 submit that there is no distinction between that
case and a case in which there is a third party who is seeking
to get the benefits of* collateral estoppel»

Since determina­

tions at lax** and equity were entitled to the same respect in
1791# at the time of the enactment of the seventh Amendment#
to suggest that the modification in the mutuality principle

)
is confined to instances where jury determination was present
in the first action would not have been understood# I would
submit# by the courts in 1791*

Each of the actions, either equitable or legal, in
1791, was treated with the same degree of respect.

And each

precluded relitigation in the second action when between
the same two parties when mutuality was required.

The erosion

of the mutuality doctrine, I submit, requires that the same
effect to equitable actions — the same preclusive effect
to equity determinations be granted to legal actions, whether
or not the same two parties are present in the action.
I submit also that there are numerous policy con­
siderations which require that decision.
the question of judicial economy.

First, there is

Tc have a second trial on

the same issues, by the same defendant, presenting the same
facts, will take up, perhaps, an enormous amount of time in
the Federal courts.

Furthermore, the Securities and Exchange

Commission is a Government body acting for the public share­
holders, and the public shareholders should be entitled to
the benefits of any decision gotten by the oPJC in its actions.
QUESTIONS

Do you know any other instances under

Federal statutes where Federal decrees are preclusive to any
extent in private litigation, besides the antitrust laws?
MR. ROE EM;

In the —
What are you reading from?
From ray brief. Your Honor.

to get the cite of the case.

I just want

I believe under the labor laws,

in Whitman Electric v» Local 363, International Brotherhood

35
Workers, 398 F, Supp. 1218, a 1974 Southern District case,
I believe that preclusive effect was given in the second
action.
QUESTION:

I am wondering what other statutory

provisions call for some kind of preclusive effects, besides
the Antitrust laws?
MR. ROSEN:

I am not aware of any, Your Honor.

I believe that it is more a common law question,,
which is to be determined by the courts.

Looking at whether

there Is a full and fair adjudication in the prior action —
QUESTION:

You would make the same argument, I

suppose, if there is an administrative agency determination
\)

that has been enforced in a court of appeals?
MR. ROfcEN:

Your Honor, not necessarily.

First,

of course, that’s not the case before this Court, but
secondly, the court would have an opportunity to examine the
administrative determination to see whether there was, in fact,
a full and fair opportunity for the defendant to present his
case.

The courts have the power, as this Court -QUESTION:

Then you suggest; it would have to be in

a court of law$ the estopping judgment has to be from a court
^

of law, not an agency, I take it?
MR. RUjEN:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

This

case only has to go as far as to say it must be in a court of
law.

But if there is a full and fair opportunity in the agencyt

36
then perhaps the court should grant collateral estoppel.

The

court can look —
QUESTION;

I take It, then, you wouldn't even limit it

to ..a determination in a court of ]aw at the behest of an agency\
It could be a private plaintiff in the first suit?
MRo ROSEN;
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
Somebody who doesn't really represent

the shareholders or the public?
MR* RGiEN;

It is like the cases which have approved

the use of the — the affirmative use of collateral estoppel*
The airplane crash case, the automobile case and the mortgage
case, which were referred to by counsel for the Petitioner*
|

When there has been a full and fair opportunity in
the prior action, regardless of whether the prior action was
♦

to a court or to a jury, then there would be collateral estop­
pel effect given*

This has always been the case x^ith respect

to actions Involving two parties.

There has always been the

preclusive effect of an equitable determination between two
parties in a second action.

The question here is whether

mutuality **» the erosion of the doctrine of mutuality should
change that rule when it comes to deciding an action involving
a stranger to the first action.

And it seems to us that the

policy consideration which favors granting preclusive effect
in a two-party situation also obtains in a three-party situa­
tion

Thank you. Your Honor.
MR. CHIJ5F JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank youe gentlemen.
