ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE K» CONNORS
On BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS
MR, CONNORSs
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the

United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit»
This

case was brought under two Federal statutess

The first statute is Title 42? U, S0 Code? Section 1985(c)•
Previously it was codified

as 42 USC 1985(3).

It is more

popularly known as the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871? passed on
April 20th of that year.
The second Federal statute under which this suit
is brought is Section 704(a)? the so-called retaliation
provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act Of 1964.

It is

a suit brought by a person named John Novotny? a former
*

second ranking official

of a Pittsburgh Savings and Loan

Association.
It was brought against the Association and its
individual officers and directors.

The facts alleged are

that the Association and its individual officers and directors

4
discriminated against women in promotions and other aspects of
employment»

Mr» Novotny allegedly protested against this

at a Board of Directors meeting»

His Title VII cause of

action is grounded on the allegation that his subsequent discharge resulted from his protest at the Board of Directors
meeting and,? therefore, was opposition against a practice made
unlawful within the meaning of Section 704(a)»
That cause of action, incidentally, was brought
against both the Association and the individual officers and
directors»

The 1985(3) cause of action is grounded upon the

allegation that the individual officers and directors acting
at all times on behalf of the Association conspired to deprive
women of their Title VII rights and acted further in
conspiracy in Mr» Novotny’s discharge»
A Motion to Dismiss in the District Court was filed
and granted as to both causes of action»

The Third Circuit,

however, sitting en banc reversed as to both causes of action»
Certiorari was sought and granted only on the 1985(3) cause
of action»

Therefore, Mr» Novotny’s Title VII retaliation

cause of action against both the Association and the indi­
viduals will survive irrespective of the outcome in this
Court»
The issues, as we see them, are threes

whether a

deprivation of Title VII rights is a deprivation of equal
privileges and immunity under the lav/s within the meaning of

5
1935(3),

Secondly, whether agents of a corporation, acting

only on the corporationes behalf, can conspire within the
meaning of 1985,

And, thirdly, and lastly, whether Congress

under 1985(3) intended to reach sex discrimination in private
employment, through the commerce clause or otherwise.
The language in 1985(3) material to this case grants
a Federal remedy when two or more persons conspire for the
purpose of depriving a class of persons of equal privileges
and immunities under the laws.

It grants a civil cause of

action to a person injured in his person or property or
deprived of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United
States,
We will lead to our first issue to determine whether
Title VII grants equal privileges under the laws.

We believe

it is most appropriate to see what the effect of the Third
Circuit9s opinion is on the workings of Title VII, which is
the right allegedly being asserted under 1985(3) here.
Through Title VII, Congress has created certain
rights to be free from discrimination in private employment,
including, for the first time, effective July 2, 1965, sex
discrimination.

At the same time Congress created what in

Section 706 is the exclusive procedure for asserting and
enforcing these Title VII created rights.
According to Mr. Novotny and the Third Circuit,
however, 1985(3) made Title VII6s administrative judicial

6
procedures pernissive at the very moment of its creation,
A person deprived of any Title VII right whatsoever
can bypass Title VII,

Congress has carefully designed*

carefully thought out administrative judicial framework with
its emphasis on conciliation and with specific time limits
deferral provisions all can be easily subverted.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or a
State Fair Employment Practice Agency* the Agency charged by
Congress with expertise in these matters that are supposed to
take a very active role in conciliation persuasion within the
framework of administrative processes of Title VII
avoided.

can be

Alternativelyf of course; a person under the Third

Circuit®s reading of 1985(3} can proceed through the
administrative processes of Title VII and ultimately perhaps
the Federal Court and at the same time proceed immediately to
Federal Court under 1985(3)* creating a very real possibility
of conflicting erroneous inconsistent decisions.

This

situation is different from what this Court decided in the
Johnson v„ Railway Express Case,
Johnson involved a preexisting* independent right to
sue under Section 1981 of Title 42,
In this case* we are talking about 1985(3) being
read to take a right created by Title VII and thereby
invalidate the administrative processes under which that Title
VII created right

was to be asserted and enforced.

7
In addition* despite the Third Circuit0s disclaimer
that 1985(3) would not apply to anything beyond equal
employment opportunities* there is no holding back the thrust
of the Third Circuit’s opinion®

The logical thrust of that

opinion is to extend 1985(3) to any Federal substantive
statute irrespective of whether such a statute has its own
administrative framework and irrespective of whether Congress
decided and designed it to be handled exclusively through its
own administrative processes®

We would have in this Court and

other Courts a needless flood of duplicative litigation
under such laws as the National Labor Relations Act* the
Fair Labor Standards

the Occupational Safety and Health

Act* the Equal Pay Act* the Labor^Management Reporting &
Disclosure Act* the Age Discrimination in Employment Act* and
we can multiply that by 10s and 20s and 30s and 40s®
In our view* however* that chaotic unreasonable re»»
suit is unnecessary®
QUESTIONS

I didn’t quite follow your argument,

I

didn’t read the Court of Appeals Opinion as going quite that
far* did you?
MR® CONNORSs
QUESTION?

Mr® Justice Stevens*»*»

They emphasized the word "equal®,

MR® CONNORSs

Yes* they did®

But I believe

under

these statutes you can read the word "equal® in such a way
that it can apply to these and other sources of laws®

8

QUESTIONS

Did anybody ask it to do that?

MR® CONNORSs

The Third Circuit’s logic, I believe*,

compels the Court to draw some sort of a line between rights
are assertable under 1985(3)~
QUESTIONS

What if we drew the line to be the kind of

thing that would be bad if it were done by a State Agency in
violation of the equal protection clause?

That’s sort of the

thrust of what they say I think0
ME® CONNORSs
opinion to say that,

I’m not sure I read the Third Circuit’s
I see the logic of the Third Circuit’s

Opinion to reach any Federal law that creates a right,
assertyble in Federal court, irrespective of whether it is
otherwise assertable within the framework of that law»
QUESTIONS

We realize the Opinion here, but we’re

passing on the judgment, aren’t we?
MR® CONNORSs

I understand, Your Honor®

We believe,

however, that chaos is unnecessary and the unreasonable result
is unnecessary because the legislative history makes clear
and the draftsmen and the sponsors of 1985C3) make clear that
1985(3) is a remedial statute®

In fact, the Third Circuit

specifically quoted from both Senator Edmonds, who was the
Floor manager in the Senate for 1985(3) and, of course, the
Ku Klux Klan Act, and also Representative Shellenberger®

The

Third Circuit’s quotes from these two individuals appear at
pages 27(a) and 29(a) of the Court’s Opinion as produced

9
in the Cert petition
1985(3) does not stand on its own.
from another sourceQ

It needs a right

It's a remedy in search of a righto

For that reason, it is unlike such laws as 1981 or Title VII,
which are substantive statutes combining both a right and
remedy, and that is the distinction between 1985(3) and,
for instance, 1981*
Admittedly, the phrase ^laws*5 in 1985(3) appears
all-inclusive*

But the legislative history makes clear that

Congress was creating a Federal remedy and a Federal forum
to assert rights, Federal rights where none previously existed*
It was a need-filling statute*,
The Ku Klux Klan Act was finally passed in 1871 by
Congress because Congress learned from painful experience that
it wasnet enough to just create laws --- create rights under,
for instance, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Amendments saying that citizens had certain rights,,
The States and individuals, as recognized in the
Griffin Case, were unwilling to protect and respect such naked
rights, unassertabie rights*

Under 1985(3), Congress made,

for the first time, such previously unassertabie rights
assertable in Federal Court»

1985(3) was and, therefore, is

a gap-filling statute to fulfill a particular need*

It wasn8t

designed to supplant or replace other carefully thought out
legislation which stands on its own like Title VII.

10

It was meant to apply where an existing remedy either
did not exist or was not being enforced,

Additionally, in

1985(3) the phrase ®equal privileges” is mentioned — equal
privileges and immunities under the law.
We are talking here about sex discrimination,

Not

every citizen has a Federal right to be free from employment
discrimination under Title VII, and that’s the right we are
talking about here,

For instance, only employees who are

employed by employers employing 15 or more individuals have a
Federal right to be free from sex discrimination.
In other words, since not every citizen has a right,
a Federal right to be free from sex discrimination, in our
view, freedom from sex discrimination is not equal, with an
accent on equal privilege and immunity because it isn’t
extended to each and every citizen,
QUESTIONz

But wouldn’t the Third Circuit’s answer

to that be that with respect to all persons employed by
employers of 15 or more persons it is a right to equal treat”
ment?
MR, CONNORSs
but if we

The Third Circuit may well say that,

go a little bit farther in the language of the

statute it says in order to assert a civil cause of action
under 1985(3) a person must be injured in his person, in
his property or deprived of a right of national citizenship.
And I submit that you do not have the right of national

11
citizenship to be free from sex discrimination since all
citizens do not have that right,
Griffin recognized the possibility that courts could
read 1985(3) to be the panacea it was not and cautioned against
reading 1985(3) as a general tort law,
Circuit's

We believe the Third

over-broad analysis and construction of 1985(3)

creates a general Federal tort law despite the language in*
for instance* Griffin* which talks about having to establish
under 1985(3) an invidiously discriminatory class-based
animus *
We submit that whenever you violate Titia VII* you
automatically have class-based animus? because we have
created ~ Congress has created certain protective classes*
such as sex* national origin* race* et cetera* under Title VII0
You automatically would have

class-based discrimination,

Invidiously discriminatory* I’m not sure exactly what that
meanso

I do know from the Screws Case and from the footnote

in the Griffin Case that it does not mean specific intent«
it means something less,,

So

And it may very well mean something

as simple to prove and automatic to prove as people intended
the logical consequence of their action.
And* thirdly* since we are dealing here with a
corporation — but it doesn’t make any difference whether
it’s a corporation or not — I would submit that virtually
decision to discharge someone or not to hire someone has a

12

legal plurality of personalities involved.

In other words,

at least two people have had input into that situation.
And if you have two people having input, you have a conspiracy.
At least two.
QUESTIONs

I thought it was

MR, CONNORS%
QUESTIONS

two or more,

Two will be fine, Your Honor.

It8s not that important to me? I°m sorry.

MR. CONNORSs

We feel that the only sensible way to

read laws within the meaning of 1985(3) are laws creating
rights not otherwise assertable without 1985(3).

In other

words, as a gap-»filling statute as the 1871 Congress fully
intended.

There are court cases that go beyond that position,

and I refer to that view as the broad view.
cases confine the wrong word.

Those court

They say 1985(3) covers rights

which came into existence after 1871, including statutory
rights.

And we submit that under our view of the statute,

even if this Court takes that view, this case ought to be
dismissed as to the 1985(3) cause of action simply because if
the laws that were created after 1871, including statutory
rights — creating statutory rights ~ are not otherwise
assertable without 1985 — they are covered under 1985(3) but
that, by no stretch of the imagination, is Title VII.
We believe, however, the correct reading of 1985(3)
is the reading that takes the statutory construction from the
language of the statute itself.

13
QUESTION?

Do you suppose you would have needed

the 1983 at all in the Griffin Case?

In Griffin against

Breckenridge* couldn't the suit have been brought directly
under — couldn't the suits have been brought directly assert™
ing rights under the Thirteenth Amendment and the Constitutiona
right to travel interstate?
MRo CONNORSs

I don't believe so, Your Honor»

I

would characterize Thirteenth Amendment rights standing alone
and not otherwise implemented by law or the right to inter­
state commerce as a naked right not otherwise asserfcable»
QUESTIONS

I know itBs not otherwise assertable» Look

at the Bivena Case? for example»

Are you familiar with that

case?
MR» CONNORS? That's Bivens v0 the six unknown—
QUESTION?

Yes»

And that was a direct action under

the general jurisdictional statute 1331e I guess»
MR» CONNORSs
QUESTIONS

That involves State involvement»

But it was a direct action under a right

directly given by the Fourteenth Amendment»
MR» CONNORSs

I believe when we have State or Federal

involvement thoughf Your Honor? we're talking about a
different—
QUESTION?

In that case- the Fourth Amendment»

An dit doesn't

say that private people can carry on involuntary servitude
after that but only States are prohibited from doing it»

And

the interstate right to travel is a right assertable against
anybody* not just against Government»
MR» CONNORSs

I submit* Your Honor* it is not assert-»

able unless there is a Federal remedy such as 1985(3)»

And

I believe that is exactly the problem that Congress grappled
with in the legislative history underlying 1985(3).

Several

people spoke to the issue* I guess first promulgated by
James Madison in the Federalist Papers
a right implies a remedy»

that the creation of

Several opponents of 1985(3) said*

15
“Why do we need do anything.

We have a Federal right,B

implies a remedy, as James Madison said.

It

Why don't we just

go ahead and let people come into Federal Court and assert
those rights even though we don't have a remedy.

And the very

telling point made immediately after that argument, and I have
forgotten the gentleman's name, but he said, ”That°s all well
and good.

We created those rights in the Thirteenth and

Fourteenth Amendment, but that didn't stop two very close
friends of mine from being shot down in the State of Florida,*8
We need something that specifically tells people that they
have a remedy in Federal Court to assert what we believe is an
unassertable right,
QUESTION;

Do you agree with others who did research

during that period that you didn't know what was going on when
one man would say yes today and no tomorrow, and sometimes
the same afternoon?
MR, CONNORSs
QUESTIONS

There was a fair amount-*»

That the only way you could do it would be

to measure it and put it on two sides as to how many times he '
said yes and how many times he said no?
MR, CONNORS%

There is a certain amount of

ambivalence on the part of the statesmen at that time,

I

believe the fact—
QUESTION?

This Court said so in the Brown Case»

MR, CONNORSs

Yes,

But I believe the decision on the

16
part of a majority of the Congress, both the Senate and the
House of Representatives, was we need to show and tell people
that they have a Federal remedy where you have naked Federal
rights.
Here it is, Section 1, which is 1983, and here is
Section 2 which is now 1985(3) of the Ku Klux Klan Act,
QUESTION?

Mr, Connors, do you take the view that

you believe the two sections which are now 1983 and 1985(3)
protect the same bundle of rights?
MR0 CONNORSs

1' do not, Your Honor,

And the reason

why — and Xem going to make one additional point, I would also
say a criminal counterpart of 1985(3), which has now been
codified as Title 18, Section 241, is more broad than 1985(3),
and that5s because 1985(3), unlike 1983, and unlike Section
241, goes on to say that in order to assert a civil cause of
action, a person has to be injured in his person or property
or deprived of a right of national citizenship.

That language

does not appear in a criminal counterpart and it also doesn51
appear in 1983, which is Section 1 of the Ku Klus Klan Act»
And that5 s why I think this case basically is a case of
statutory interpretation and construction„
QUESTIONS

Well, if you0re arguing that the party

so injured language narrows the statute, I should think you
would have argued that the Plaintiff being male was not a membe:
of the class being injured*

You didn°t make that argument»

17
MRe CONNORSs

That argument was made both in the

District Court and the Circuit,,

Since the case came down

9 to nothing I suggest that the Third Circuit was not per­
suaded by that argument»
QUESTION?

They really weren®t persuaded by anything»

MR» CONNORS%

I agree fully, Your Honor»

Our position is that that language that follows
that only is contained in 1983(3) —
QUESTIONS

They also weren°t persuaded by what I

wrote o
MR» CONNORSs

I consider myself in good company, Your

Honor o
But our position is that that language that follows,
the special language that follows in 1985(3) tells us really
what Congress intended to reach so far as rights are con­
cerned, as far as the civil conspiracy remedy now set forth
in 1985(3) or (c), however you would refer to it»
view, as I said, is taken from 1935(3) itself»

And that

It says

specifically that the civil action is available only to a
person injured in his person or property or deprived of any
right or privilege of a citizen of the United States,
Statutory rights are not mentioned by 1985(3),

In

this case, Mr» Novotny has alleged no injury to his person and
I submit that no one under a situation like this has injury to
his person or a deprivation of a property right.

There is no

18

property right to a job,

And, thirdly, there is no deprivation

of a right of citizenship.

As I

said earlier, Title VII does

not give an untramraeled right to every citizen to be free from
sex discrimination,
QUESTION?

Mr, Connors, you haven8t quite said it, or

if you have, I missed it, but is it your position in net and
in sum that 1985(3) protects or authorizes the assertion only
of Constitutional rights, not statutory rights?
MR, CONNORS?
QUESTION?

Yes, Your Honor,

Even if the statute is specifically passed

to enforce the Constitution?
MR, CONNORSs

We are talking about Constitutional

rights though, Your Honor,

All I am saying is that's what

the statute says,
QUESTION?

Wasn't Title VII passed specifically

to enforce the Constitution?
MR, CONNORS?

Those naked, unassertable rights under

the Constitution,
QUESTION?

Now, where do you say the statute says

that, excuse me?
MR, CONNORS?

Where it says a person has a civil

remedy when he is injured in his person or property or deprived
of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States,
The phrase “rights or privileges admittedly, are terms of
art, the draftsmen in the House, and the Floor manager,

19
Representative Shellenberger, talks about privileges,
immunities and says that they are fundamental rights, inherent
in citizenship of the United States, as derived from the
Constitutione

And a little bit later in the legislative
)

history, Representative Kerr, I believe from Illinois, said,
/

SI understand what you are saying about privileges and
immunities being fundamental rights of citizenship derived from
the Constitution, but in your first draft you’ve got rights,
privileges and immunities.“
And Mr. Shellenberger, a couple pages later, finally
got around to saying, “Thata s right»

QUESTIONS

So your submission is that 1985(3)

authorizes lawsuits to protect only rights conferred by the
Constitution»
MRo CONNORSs

And injury to persons or property, to

the extent that it arises under the Constitution, yes»

But

we are saying that even though that's our view which is taken
from the statute, even if this Court takes the broad view
taken by other Circuits and District Courts, this case can
also be dismissed because the Congressional intent was
only to apply 1985(3)
assertable»

where the right was not otherwise

And Title VII, of course, is otherwise assertable»

So this Court has its choice»
QUESTIONS

Not by the Respondent in this case»

MR» CONNORSt

He did assert his Title VII rights

within the context of Title VII»

He filed a charge, and his

Title VII action is brought against both the Association and

21
the individuals, and that will survive.
QUESTIONS

You told us at the outset.

MR. CONNORSs

Yes* Your Honor.

As we pointed out, to determine «—» moving to our
second issue since I see my time is fast moving — to
determine whether corporate agents, acting on a corporations
behalf, can conspire under 1985(3), we must recognize, first
of all, how a corporation really acts, exclusively through its
agents, incapable of acting without them,,

That• s why a

corporatior4 is only one person under the law.

Next we must

see if under 1985(3) there is any need to disregard how a
corporation really acts.
several reasons»

And we say there is no need for

First, because under Title VII, the corporate

veil can be pierced in the classic sense where a corporation
is a shell without assets or erected for an unlawful purpose.
Also under Title VII, an agent can be held individually
liable.

In fact, the Solicitor General has cited a few cases

in his brief to that effect, and that5s taken from the
definition of Section 701(b), which defines an employer and
the corporation and any of its agents.

Under principles of

tort, agents can be held individually liable as joint tort”
*■

feasors.

Through principles of respondiat superior, a

corporation and its agents are already exposed to liability,
much as the individual conspirators are exposed to liability
in a civil conspiracy context.

We say there isn't any need to

22

punish? to get out and punish the conspirators because 1985(3}
creates a civil conspiracy.

And it's only a criminal

conspiracy that is out to punish individual conspirators.
the job of Section 241 of Title

That

18.

We also say that to rule otherwise and say that a
corporation can conspire with its agents could very easily
chili collective action? the very life blood of a corporation.
And? finally? the Dictionary Act? which was passed on
February25? of 1871? mere days before 1985(3} was drafted?
defined the word “^person® to include a corporation? as noted
in this Court's Mlnnel

decision? to include a corporation

within the framework of the definition person unless the
context of the statute clearly indicates a more limited
definition.

after having been engaged in efforts to support claims and
complaints made by women employees of the bank for which he
worked, that they had been discriminated against over a period

of time and were continuing to be discriminated against.
He supported them verbally in a meeting of the Board.
He supported them with his vote, and voted against action taken
by all of the other members of the Board, and he was in an
extreme minority in his actions, did not side with “Management58

Employment Opportunity Commission and two years later a right
to sue letter was issued to him.

The longstanding history

of inferior treatment which we would have been prepared
to prove had we ever gotten past the Motion to Dismiss, in­
cluded women being paid less for the same work? receiving
fewer promotional opportunities—
QUESTIONS

Mr. Stein, could I interrupt with just

one question?
MR. STEINs
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor.
You have alternative theories in the

District Court, one under Title VII and one under 1985(3)?
MR. STEINs
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.
If you prove the facts you are just

24
describing to us$ you* presumably„ would recover under
Title VII,
1985(3)?

Do you need to prove any less to recover under
Is there any difference in the evidence that has to

be presented by you to recover under one rather than the other?
MRo STEIN;

Yes* I think I would have to prove under

1985(3) that the discriminatory actions on the part of the
members of the Board were intentionally undertaken for the
purpose of invidiously discriminating against a group* or
class-QUESTIONS

Don’t you need to prove that in order

to recover for the man under Title VII?

Don’t you have to

prove precisely the same thing?
MRo STEINs

No* not necessarily,

I don’t know that

I would have to prove any more than they fired him because of
his particular advocacy,

I don’t know that they have to have

had an actual discriminatory animus against the women who
they discriminated against0

And it may be that I will want to

prove that—
QUESTIONS
MR, STEINs

What do you mean by “discriminatory animus®1'
Well* that their intention in firing him

was because they had — they were subjectively opposed to
women’s rights* they subjectively intended—
QUESTIONS
MR, STEINs

You have to prove their motive,
Yes,

QUESTIONS An evil motive against women.

25
MR, STEINs
QUESTION?

Against women,
And you don't have to prove that under

the Title VII case?
MR, STEINs

I don't think I have to prove that under

Title VII—
QUESTION?
MR, STEINs

Which is the easier of the two?
The Title VII case is the easier of the

two,
QUESTION?
MR, STEINs

Then why are you pursuing this one?
Because I think that this is a

particularly aggravated situation and I think under the circum­
stances the individual should he required to be held
individually responsible? if they can be.

And I think the

salutary effect—
QUESTIONS

In other words? the difference is you

cannot hold the individuals responsible under Title VII?
MR, STEINs

I

may or may not be able to,

I have

never had the opportunity actually to develop the facts,
QUESTION?

Assume you prove everything you have

alleged—
MR, STEINs

Then I would collect under Title VII? but

I would not necessarily collect to the same extent,
QUESTIONS
1985(3)?

Do you think the remedy is greater under

What under the statute gives you a greater remedy?

I'm not sure I—

26
MR, STEINs

Under 1985(3)

I may* and, again without

saying that I do because this Court has never so indicated,
and I would really like to get to the fact development to
determine and to continue on with the case, but I may have
a right to collect compensatory damages in the nature of
additional costs for searching for another job,

I may have

the right to collect for punitive damages if I can find an
applicable-”
QUESTION?

In a word, you think the 1985(3) provides

greater remedy than Title VII?
MR0 STEINs

I think the 1985(3) may provide greater

remedies and, at this point, these questions have not been
decided by this Court and I think that’s somewhere down the
road,

I would like to get to that point,
QUESTION?

Mr, Stein, ara I wrong in thinking that

the right you say is created by Title VII is the substantive
right which you are seeking to enforce under 1985?
MR, STEINs

Yes, sir, I would say that that’s the

case in this particular instance, without necessarily conceding
to the Court because I haven't fully gone into it without
necessarily conceding that 1985(3) didn't create any substantive
rights, but I would say that we are asserting under 1985(3)
the statute passed by Congress which created the equality of
rights for women and others.
QUESTION?

Certainly that's what the Third Circuit

27
said?
MR, STEINs

Yes,

I felt it didn't have to go any

farther than it did* and it didn't,,

An d I think the Third

Circuit simply felt that Congress was well within its
Constitutional powers to do that* if that's what it wanted to
do*
QUESTIONS
remedy here»

Well* no one is challenging the Title VII

The question is whether the Title VII right is

one that can be enforced not only under the Title VII
procedures set up in '84 but it is also subject to the pro™
cedures provided in 1985(3) e
MR, STEINs

Correct,

There are certain matters which I did not think were
in serious dispute,

I think that women are among persons who

are protected under 1985(3) and I think it8s also clear that
discrimination against women as a class is invidious
discrimination,

I think that 1985(3)* the persons who suffer

the discriminatory animus and the person who suffers the
damage do not necessarily have to be the same person* and I
find nothing in 1985(3) which would prohibit a man or any
other person* a man from asserting a right or asserting
damage resulting from the invidious discrimination when he
has* in fact* suffered that damage.
And I would also like to point out to the Court
that this is not a case in which 1985(3) was used to circumvent

28
Title VII procedures,,

Mr, Novotny immediately went to the

EEOC and filed his claim with the EEOC and permitted the
EEOC procedures to run long beyond the point at which he would
have a right to have his right to sue issued to him if he
had requested it* regardless of what else happened.
The argument that Title VII will be undermined by
1985(3) is an argument'which I think has been made many times
to this Court,

And I don’t think there is any reason to be­

lieve that the use of Title VII will undermine the provisions •
I mean the use of 1985(3) will undermine the provisions of
Title VII in any way.
QUESTION?

There aremajor benefits—

Do you agree then that your client could

not go directly to court as soon as the claimed retaliation
took place under 1985(3) but would first have to go to the
EEOC?
MR, STEINs

No* I do not* but I believe that he could

go to court if he wanted to under 1985(3),

I do not believe

that very many people will.
QUESTIONS
MR. STEINs

But those who want could circumvent?

I think that those who want to could* and

those who want to file 1981 actions in a race case could.

Court in those kinds of cases.

The right that you are asserting in this

I would have to wait 180 days for my

right to sue letter, at which point I could request—

Thank you? Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Wallace.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
AMICUS CURIAE
MR. WALLACES
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

It is the position of the United States and the

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in this Court that
eight years ago this Court, after a careful review of the
legislative history of what is now 1985(c) in the latest
edition of Title 42? restored that statute to its proper role
in civil rights enforcement? and that the Court of Appeals in
this case properly extended the principles of the Griffin
decision in a manner that is compatible with Title VII.
As we understand the basic principle of Griffin v.
Breckenridge? it8s that 1985(c) serves as a remedy for
aggravated cases of the violation of other Federal rights? in
which a number of individuals sharing a class-abased
discriminatory animus join in a scheme to deprive a person or
persons of their rights under Federal law.

And? therefore?

36

deny them, equal protection of the Federal law — equal rights
and privileges under the laws, in the words of the statute»
And that is the kind of claim that the Court of Appeals
construed the complaint here that was raised in this case, and
no question has been put to this Court about the Court of
Appeals9 construction of the complaint, nor has any question
been raised about what the Court of Appeals has decided under
Title ¥11 in the case thus far»

Although we noted on page

27 of our brief, in footnote 16 that the Petitioners have
reserved the possibility of asserting a defense for the
individual directors under Title VII based upon the fact they
were not named in the original Title VII charge individually»
We have stated our view that that x^ould not be a
valid defense»
QUESTIONS

Is it also arguable that they are not

employers within the meaning-MR» WALLACES

Well, the statutory definition of

employer in Title VII includes agent of the employer»

So that

anyplace the word “employer6’ or the statutory definition of
“union® is the same in Title VII»

So anyplace there is a

liability of the employer or the union there is a liability of
the agent»
QUESTIONS

Since you are not in this, Mr» Wallace,

I presume you are not entitled to enlarge or subtract issues
in the case

37
MRo WALLACES
not attempting to»

I assume so, Mr» Justice»

And we are

I was just mentioning the relationship

between the Title VII claim which has not been brought here,
but where a defense still remains to be asserted in the case»
The question had been raised about why did the Petitioners
bring only the 1985 claim here and this is one factor that was
not mentioned in previous discussions»
The Court of Appeals had to reach some issues that
this Court in Griffin did not find it necessary to reach in
order to decide the case»
presented in this Court»

And a number of those have not been
There is no claim made in this Court

that the Court of Appeals erred in construing 1985(c)

as

extending to class-basea deprivation other than racial
deprivations»

The Court of Appeals dealt with that issue

correctly, in our view, but the question, as we see it, is not
before the Court»

Although what the case doss present to the

Court is a question whether the kind of supplemental remedy
that Section 1981 provides under this Court8 s unanimous
decision in Johnson v» Railway Express on this point, that
kind of supplemental remedy in racial cases under Title VII
will also exist in sex discrimination cases under Title VII»
That#s one way of looking at the question that is presented
here because j.301 addresses only racial discrimination, and
the other classes protected by Title VII have to look to 1985(c)
as*"*-

38

QUESTION?

Which they couldn't before Title VII»

MRe WALLACE?

But* of course, Title VII is available

for racial cases as well as the other,,

I

The only supplemental

remedy comparable to 1981 for the other classes protected by
Title VII is 1985(c), and that is the significance of the
case, whether the supplemental remedy will be limited to racial
cases, looking at the case as an employment discrimination
case»
QUESTION?

What kind of a class-based discrimination

must be alleged, do you think, Mr. Wallace?

In this case, it's

against women?
MR» WALLACEs

In this case itas against women and

that resulted in some injury to this employee»

He became a

person injured in the retaliation»
QUESTION?

Respecting my brother Steven's question,

do you have to allege something besides just treating women
as a class differently?

You must say they have the purpose

of treating them differently?
MR» WALLACE?
differently.

As intentionally treating them

Yet, as we see 1985(c), it involves additional

elements to a Title VII violation in the sense that it's a
kind of aggravated kind of Title VII violation»

It's not that

1985(c) is a separate substantive right against discrimination»
It's a remedy for aggrevated violations of rights defined
elsewhere

39

QUESTIONS

Aggravated in the sense*””

MR. WALLACES

There has to be a conspiracy, and the

conspiracy must involve a shared animus, a shared classbased animuso
QUESTION?

What do you mean by 0animus"?

Do you mean

to treat them differently?
QUESTIONS

For example, take the manhard Case, which

I am sure you8re familiar with, would the action of the
director there to adopt different pay contributions for women
and men, would that violate 1985?
MS. WALLACE?

It doesn't mean anything other than

to treat them differently in the sense that the focus is on
class.
QUESTIONS

If you have a payscale and the women

get 10 percent less than men, even though you think they are
10 percent less efficient, and it proved out later you were
wrong, you would violate 1985(3)? is that your position?
MR. WALLACES

That's right.

But Title VII under

this Court's decision in Griggs extends to employment criteria
where the focus is not on the protected class0

Griggr

involved a high school diploma requirement for someone hired
to shovel coal at the Duke Power Company, as well as tests
that were given0
QUESTIONS

And those had a disparate effect—
You say that requiring a high school

diploma for shovelling coal would violate 1985(3)?

40

MRo WALLACES

There would have to be a showing that

there was something more than a desire to encourage people
not to drop out of high school or, you know* hope that people
hired at the bottom would have the ability to ride up through
the company, something that did focus on animus toward the
protected class„
QUESTIONS

Just unequal impact would not be enough?

MRe WALLACE?

Unequal impact would not be enough

under 1985(c) but, as we understand, it is enough under
Title VII.
QUESTION?

On animus, a few years ago when this

Court said women were entitled to sit on the jury, the Court
was guilty of animus?

I think the word is a very carelessly

used word»
MRo WALLACES
QUESTION?

Well, perhaps it is®

Do I understand you meaning, you don’t

have to have what you and I think of animus-*-»
MRo WALLACES
QUESTIONS

Well, it doesn’t have to be hostility»

Righto

MR» WALLACE?

Right»

But there has to be a shared purpose

to deprive members of one of the protected classes of their
Federal right, although—
QUESTIONS

Or putting it more simply, a shared purpose

to treat them differently from the members not in the class»
That’s the whole thing»

41
MRo WALLACES
agree with that*
of 1985(3)„

That6s simply put* and we don8t dis­

And that* we think* is the proper office

The legislative history of Title VII* which this

Court has reviewed in detail in recent cases* it is quite
specific that the comparable supplemental remedy under 1981
was to be preserved and was considered by those who enacted
Title VII to be corapatable with the exhaustion requirements
and the administrative procedure that was set up under Title
VII„

It would be difficult to find a Federal statute with

more specific history that the remedies created along with the
substantive rights in Title VII were not intended to be
exclusive* but were intended to permit a supplemental remedy
that is comparable in every way to the remedy being asserted
here under 1985 (c) „

It°s difficult—

QUESTION i

19 81-

QUESTION %

—don51 depend in any way on Title VII8

The right claimed here does depend on thatc
MR, WALLACE?

There is a difference in theory of the

remedy* that is correct* Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

But; * from the

standpoint of the legislative intent of the sponsors of
Title VII* it is apparent that they did not think it would be
inappropriate to have a remedy that was in every way
comparable still available for persons protected against
racial, discrimination by Title VII„

And there's

no reason

to think their view would be different if they had focused

42
on the question about the other classes protected "by Title VII,
So it’s a matter of statutory construction of Title VII there
is no reason to think that a bar to alternative remedies was
intendedo
QUESTIONS

But is there any reason to think they

intended that Title VII remedies were to be enforced in any
other way than that provided in Title VII?
MR, WALLACES

They certainly did»

They intended that

not the Title VII remedies would be enforced but alternative
remedies would still be available and none would be taken
away»

So that if our construction of 1985(c) is correct, it

extends to aggravated instances of class-based deprivations of
rights prescribed by other Federal laws or the Constitution,
then Congress indicated in Title VII no desire to take away
that method of asserting the right in the Federal courts»
QUESTION?

What is the aggravation in this case?,
*

t'

under the bill of complaint, beyond preferring to employ men
to women?

Is that aggravation per se?
MR, WALLACES

Well, it is the shared purpose, the

conscious conspiracy in the sense of a shared purpose to treat
women differently, even though Federal law says they should not
be treated differently.

It is not more complex than that,

Mr» Justice,
QUESTION?

Well, it3s certainly a pattern in the

business life of this country and that’s carried over into the

43
Government in this country and right into this Court®

Most

of the secretaries of the Justices and the presidents of
corporations and Congressmen are women®

Now, would that be

the kind of shared purpose* in some way* are all of these
people disfavoring of men because we have found* or at least
we think we have found that women are more dextrous* they
do a lot of things better than men do?

I think for years and

years with two or three exceptions over this century all of
the secretaries of Justices in this Court have been women®
MR® WALLACES
turned away®

Well* perhaps a few men have been

I don’t know that male applicants have not

received fair consideration®
QUESTION?

Certainly* under Title VIX«—

They have been frightened away by the

tradition®
MRe WALLACES

Women who aspire to this kind of

employment have the right to be considered on their merit*
even if all the other secretaries are women®

It relates to

a previous argument in this term®
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Well* that terminates this®

Thank you* gentlemen* the case is submitted®

above-entitled matter was submitted®)
