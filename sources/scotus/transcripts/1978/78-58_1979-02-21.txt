MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

Mr. Christensen, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG A. CHRISTENSEN.^ ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a suit filed by the petitioner in the Bank­
ruptcy Court seeking a determination that a debt owed him by
the respondent and evidenced by a pre-bankruptcy state court
judgment was not dischargeable, based upon section 17a(2) and
(*U of the Bankruptcy Act.
The Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment for
the respondent, determining the debt to be dischargeable,
and that order was affirmed by the District Cou, t for the
District of Colorado and by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit0

This Court granted certiorari.
The facts upon which that summary judgment was

entered are as follows:

In June 1975, Jefferson Bank

&

Trust

Company began an action against the respondent, Mr» Felsen,
his company, Le Mans Motors, and the petitioner, Garvin Brown,
The bank’s claim against the respondent was based on a
promissory note he had executed.

The bank’s claim against

Mr. Brown, the petitioner, x^as premised upon a guarantee of
that note he had executed in favor of the bank.
Mre Brown filed a crossclaim against Mr. Pelsen
based upon indemnity.

No claims of fraud were pledged in the

state court action by Mrc Brown against the respondent.
Shortly after the respondent's deposition,, the
parties all stipulated to judgment.

Mr. Brown stipulated to

entry of judgment in favor of the bank and against him; the
respondent stipulated to the entry of judgment in a like
amount in favor of Mr0 Brown and against the respondent.

The

state court entered judgment based upon that stipulation.

No

evidentiary record was made.
Thereafter, the respondent filed his petition in
bankruptcy and Mr. Brown commenced an adversary proceeding to
have it determined that the debt owed him by the respondent was
not dischargeable,,

Mr, Pelsen moved for summary judgment,

contending that, despite the obligation ©f the Bankruptcy
Court to determine dischargeability., since no fraud had beerpled in the

state court action, the Bankruptcy Court could

not go beyond that record, it being res judicata, and the debt
would have to be termed dischargeable in the absence of that
fraud finding.
QUESTION:

Had he filed the claim?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

In the state court, Your Honor?

No, in the Bankruptcy Court.

5
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Mr. Brown?

Yes.

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I don’t believe he had filed a

claim»
QUESTION:

Would he have to?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

No, I don't believe he would have

to by virtue of the adversary proceeding because the court is
bound there to'enter judgment»

The claim would only go to

his rights to distribution from the estate
QUESTION:

I see ~

MR» CHRISTENSEN:

— not to his eventual rights to

collect it.
QUESTION:

Well, if the bank didn’t list him as a

debtor, he is going to be Included anyway.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Well, he wouldn’t be included in

the distribution,
QUESTION:

Is that right?

MR» CHRISTENSEN:

He would not share in the distribu­

tion from the estate, the same with a secured creditor who
may opt not to file a claim for the deficiency, but it doesn't
relate to his rights between he and the debtor with regard to
the security.

I am talking from recollection0

I am not sure,

perhaps the claim was filed in this matter.
QUESTION:
court?

And what is the jurisdiction for the

6
MRo CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

The Bankruptcy Court?

Yes.

MRo CHRISTENSEN:

Section l?c provides that the

creditor who wants to seek a determination of non-discharge­
ability must file, and that filing was made on a timely basis0
QUESTION:

Well, you are suggesting, however, that

he doesn’t have to have been determined to be a creditor by
filing a claim?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

No, not — he would have to to

share In the distributions from the estate, but not to retain
a non-dischargeable claim to be collected from post-bankruptcy
assets.

In any event, if that were important, I would want

to supplement the record.
was filed»

I just donBt recall whether a. claim

I believe it was, but I am not sure»
QUESTION:

Well, I was asking just what the Juris­

diction of the court was»
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Yes.

It comes up, I believe, under

17c, under 125*i, review of the bankruptcy determinations.
I submit to the Court that the decision of the Tenth
Circuit ought to be vacated and the petitioner allowed to
proceed on his complaint.

I submit that for three reasons»

Number one, the 1970 amendments to section 17 of the Bankruptcy
Act. place exclusive jurisdiction over section a(2) and a(4)
determinations in the Bankruptcy Court.

So that reliance for

this determination on the wording of a judgment issued by a

7
prior court without this jurisdiction is a misplaced reliance.
Seconds the Bankruptcy Act is a federal statute.

It

requires a uniform nationwide interpretation with respect to
these fresh start provisions, and it ought not to have the
fresh start for dischargeability provisions dependent upon the
various standards
QUESTION:

What if the Issue had been raised in the

state litigation and there had been allegations of fraud under
Colorado law and there had been some determinations that way?
I suppose you would take the same position, that fraud is a
federal concept and it would have to be relitigated?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

That8s correct.

I would say that

collateral estoppel . I would say two things.

First of all,

dischargeability —
QUESTION:

Except on facts, you would say just

facts?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

That’s right, to the extent any

facts have bean actually litigated by the parties and actually
determined, those facts would be binding.

The Bankruptcy Court

would consider those facts with any other facts that the
parties would wish to put before the court and weigh the facts
against the federal standard which is made applicable by

17a and b,
QUESTION:
res judicata.

But there wouldn’t be any such thing as

8
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Well., there would be no res

judicata because the claims aren’t the same®

State fraud Is

not the same as the grounds for dischargeability in *»QUESTION:

It is fundamental to your case, I take

It?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

That8s correct. Your Honor.

Well, we don't have to decide here any

possible instances in which a bankruptcy court night in pursu­
ing the authority given under the '70 amendments treat factual
adjudications in the state court as binding on It?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
that point.

I don't believe you have to reach

While It might be instructive, this is a case in

which no evidentiary record was made —
QUESTION:

To accept your assertion the way you made

it, it is broad enough to cover those situations?
MR® CHRISTENSEN:

That’s correct®

The third reason that I have for asking this Court
to vacate the Tenth Circuit rule is that the rule established
by the Tenth Circuit will discourage settlement:: and it will
force unnecessary litigation on already crowded courts, so
that a creditor might preserve his federal rights under section
17 of the Bankruptcy Act from loss from the failure to assert
a prior state court remedy, reviving in another form the very
abuse that Congress meant to cure by passing the 1970 amend­
ments .

9
Previously, the two-step process worked in reverse
in which a debtor might seek the protection of the Bankruptcy
Court and be granted his discharge.

A creditor could then

go to state court and seek to obtain a finding of nondischargeability j the discharge being in the nature of
affirmative defense, a default judgment might be entered
against the debtor, he relying on the mistaken assumption that
his discharge was automatic and need not be pled*

Congress

pointed out in the legislative history which is cited to the
Court in our brief that it wished to instead place exclusive
jurisdiction in the Bankruptcy Court.

Now, presumably the

creditor may go to the State court before the bankruptcy pro­
ceeding and seek a judgment necessarily under the Tenth
Circuit rule that will include findings of fraud.

Presumably,

if those findings are entered, the converse of the Tenth
Circuit rule will be true and they will be binding upon the
bankrupt and, as I say, reviving in but the converse, the?
very abuse which Congress meant to curea
I listened with interest as Mr. Justice Stevens
announced the ruling in a Bankruptcy Court case this morning.
I have not read that opinion, obviously, but I understood Mr,
Justice Stevens to state that the Court’s reasoning was that
the application of state law In that particular case was going
to be mandated because there was no applicable federal
standard for the matter and that it was more properly the

10
function of the state courts to determine rightts in that par­
ticular Instance.
It seems to me that that 3ame reasoning applied to
this case would require the vacation of the Tenth Circuit
rule.

There are specific applicable federal standards in

this casea

They are contained in section 17a of the Bankruptcy

Act as to which debts are dischargeable and which are not.
More importantly with respect to the second reasons
here Congress9 in section 17c of the Bankruptcy Act, which
remains fundamentally unchanged in the new Act to take effect
this October, placed exclusive Jurisdiction for two kinds at
least, section 17a(2) and 17a(*0 claims fo$’ dischargeability
determination in the Bankruptcy Court, removing that jurisdic­
tion from the state courts.
It seems to me that creditors ought not to be en­
couraged to go into the state courts prior to a bankruptcy
seeking default judgments based upon fraud, nor should state
courts be forced to try issues which are not necessary to the
rendition of judgments on commercial paper in order that a
creditor may preserve his rights to later raise the federal
right for a determination of dischargeability.
QUESTION:

I presume that the holder of a promissory

note against a solvent signer of It has no particular interest
in getting a Judgment based on fraud If he can simply get a
judgment on the note?

11
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

That is absolutely true, Your

Honor, absolutely true, especially if the fraud to be main­
tained as a false financial statement that perhaps only
materializes later.

But even if known at the time, the

remedy to be afforded by the state court is going to be
identical, is going to be the same amount unless you want to
establish the situation where you force the creditor to seek
punitive damages or some other extraordinary judicial remedy
because of the fraud.
I think that perhaps some clemency, if you will, on
the part of the creditor, that is of raising only the Issues
that are necessary to his judgment on the commercial paper
would be the more expedient and the more orderly course of
action.

I do not think that it ought to be made mandatory

that a creditor assert a state right

at one point in the pro­

ceedings when he does not even know that there may or will be
a bankruptcy in order to preserve a federal right at a later
stage o
By analogy, one might suggest that had Mr. Brown in
this case received stock from Mr® Pelsen as consideration for
his executing the guarantee, would he have equally been com­
pelled to raise questions of fraud in the delivc-ry of the or
the obtaining of the stock for a guarantee In the state court
In order to preserve his remedies under the Securities Acts
for those claims upon which exclusive jurisdiction is given to

12
the Federal District Courts.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Tenth Circuit would have

come out the same if there had been no state court litigation?
I read their opinion as holding more the idea that anything
that was litigated or might have been litigated in the state
court is binding on the Bankruptcy Court, not that you had to
go to state court to litigate0
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

No.

I think had there been no

state court litigation, there would have been no judgment for
the Bankruptcy Court to refer to.

I would agree, they are

talking in terms of what had been litigated.

However, it is

interesting that in the two Tenth Circuit cases, both Raley
and this case, there was no litigation, if you will*

One is

a default judgment and one is a stipulated judgment.

The

respondent suggests that perhaps the petitioner in this case
could have asked the respondent to stipulate as to its non­
dischargeability.

However, I don't think that is a remedy

available to a creditor.
QUESTION:

Some of the most successful litigators

specialize in default judgments.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
that*

That is correcto

I understand

But I do not tbelieve that in either the case of a

default judgment or a stipulated judgment that there have
been any issues litigated between the parties which bear on
a federal right under section 17.

They certain].;/ establish

13
whether or not a debt Is clue and owing from one party to
another.

I don’t think they establish the federal character

of that debt»
For those reasons and for the reasons cited in our
brief, the petitioner would ask that this Court vacate the
judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and
allow the petitioner to proceed upon his complaint in the
bankruptcy case»
Thank you.
Milo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well»

Mr. Keller»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEX STEPHEN KELLER, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KELLER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
On behalf of the respondent, we suggest that the
Tenth Circuit’s decision is supported both by good law and by
common sense.

Counsel suggests that the determination of

dischargeability in the Bankruptcy Court is exclusive»

I

don’t find the \?ord ’’exclusive” in the statute that has been
cil;ed.
mine

It simply says that the Bankruptcy Court shall deter­
dischargeability, and we don’t quarrel with that, and

that Is In the 1970 amendment to the Act.
But when petitioner says that there is a distinct
difference between proving fraud in a state court and proving
fraud in the Bankruptcy Court, I disagree with the petitioner.

The definition of "fraud" under Colorado law, which we have
cited in Morrison v9 Goodspeed, element four, on intent, is
the same as fraud in the federal system»

And to say that the

Colorado law on fraud is substantially different from the
state law simply isn't a fact.

It is a distinct,ion without

any real difference»
If a state court in Colorado, and I suspect most
states, finds a misrepresentation intentionally made, and so
on, and finds fraud, that that is substantially the same as
what the Bankruptcy Act says is nondischarging»
QUESTION:

Well, I take it that — dicl you under­

stand counsel to say that he thought the intent of the federal
law of the dischargeability provision was to make sure that
the fraud which barred dischargeability was the same country­
wide, would be the same country-wide?
MR» KELLER:

No, sir»

I understood counsel to say

that in our case —
QUESTION:

I understood him to say that the standard

would be a federal standard applicable country-wide»
MR. KELLER:

I understood counsel to say that, but

I can’t really argue against that»
QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

You can’t?
No.

I think —

Well, you don’t suggest that the Colorado

law on fraud is the same as the law of fraud in every state,

15
do you?
MR. KELLER;
QUESTION:

No, I don't»
Well, then —

MR. KELLER:

I say It is as stringent as the law in

the Bankruptcy Court»

I am not familiar with the common law

of the other forty-nine states and therefore I can't tell you
whether all of the elements required in Colorado are true In
all the states.
QUESTION:

Well, why do you agree so readily that It

has to be -- that the Bankruptcy Act contemplates a national
standard of fraud, rather than picking up the fraud standard
from the state in which the Bankruptcy Court is sitting or
picking up the fraud standard of any state law which might
govern the transaction?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

The reason I say that
The case that Mr0 Justice Stevens

announced this morning seems to think that the state law
would govern, and the state law might be different in every
state.
MR. KELLER:

Well, I could, of course, be entirely

in error, but the way I read the -QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:
White.

1 am sure you could buy that»
Oh, yes, very readily, Mr» Justice

The Bankruptcy Act does in fact go Into some more

detail about what Is fraud than it does with respect to who

16
gets the rent as between the trustee and so on and so forth.
QUESTION:

So you think that perhaps the bankruptcy

law did contemplate a national standard of fraud with respect
to dischargeability?
MR0 KELLER:

I think It contemplates a national

standard in the light of good common sense, but I don't think
it talks about nit-picking slight differences.

I frankly

don't know the law on fraud in every state.
Counsel says that to reach a contrary result to
petitioner’s position, that is to sustain the Tenth Circuit,
means that the courts in the states are going to be overly
crowded with creditors unnecessarily trying to plead and
prove fraud when they shouldn't have to, but the crowding of
the courts —
QUESTION:

They often don’t need to to get their

j udgment„
MR. KELLER:
petitioner’s arguments.

Right, and I think that is one of
But the state courts are crowded as

are the federal courts, and in the case of the creditor who
has a bona fide fraud claim — I don't mean an after-thought
like this one, I mean a bona fide fraud claim which he urges
throughout and pleads It, which they didn't do here, that
kind, of a creditor has many ways to protect himself.
The petitioner suggests, as I said in my brief,
that we could stipulate the non-dischargeability»

That is

17
against the law*

That lsnet what I said’ in my brief.

What I

said in the brief was that the creditor can seek a stipulation
that the question of fraud is preserved, may be raised in the
Bankruptcy Court, he’s not waiving those claimsQ
all sorts of things»

He can do

But the first thing he has to do is

plead it, xvhich he didn’t do in the state court»
QUESTION:

I thought he did refer to misrepresenta­

tion»
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:
MR» KELLER:

No, Your Honor.
He did not?
No, sir»

There was an affirmative de­

fense, an affirmative defense, not a crossclaim, in which Mr.
Brown said that there were mlsrepi’esentations by other
defendants, in the plural.
QUESTION:

He did not include ~ he did not charge

Mr* Pelsen with misrepresentation?
MR. KELLER:

No, sir, no crossclaim against Mr.

Pelsen of fraud, and counsel for petitioner just a few minutes
ago conceded that.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought, as Mr. Justice Powell

did, that in the answer there was a statement that he was
induced to sign such a guarantee by representations and non­
disclosures of material fact by the defendant.
MR» KELLER:
QUESTION:

I believe —
That is on page 35 of the appendix»

13
In fact* It says "the other defendants."

There are only two

other defendants in this case, aren9t there?
MR0 KELLER:
affirmative defense,

That8s correct.

I see on page 35 an

I don't see an allegation of fraud in

any erossclaims and the Tenth Circuit, in the case at bar, in
its opinion found that there was a casual reference to fraud
in the answer, and it does not meet by rules of civil pro­
cedure, it does not meet Morrison v. Goodspeed, and was dis­
regarded by the Tenth Circuit .

That was in the affirmative

defense.
QUESTION:

Mr. Keller, is it not true that pleading

fraud would not have done the guarantor any good in the state
court action?

I guess the guarantor was the only solvent

party in the state court proceeding.
MR0 KELLER:

In the action by the bank against the

guarantor, it would have availed him nothing®

In the

guarantor’s crossclaim against Mark Felsen, had he chosen in
his erossclaim to plead fraud, which he didn’t do on page 36
in the appendix, number five, had he chosen to do that, then
the bankrupt, when it came time to try to stipulate to a
judgment, had merely three choices:

(a) he could stipulate

that he was guilty of fraud —
QUESTION:
MR0 KELLER:

Which is unlikely.
Unlikely — (b) he could stipulate on

the guarantee, that he was liable under the guarantee, which

19
Is what he did, or (c) he could stipulate for judgment against
himself on the guarantees but the creditor at that point had
properly pleaded9 could well have insisted on a clause that
fraud is not waived, it is asserted for conveniences it is
not asserted in the stipulation or judgment that none of the
creditor's rights on fraud are 'waived.
QUESTION;

Mr. Kellers all of the crossclaim by

Brown against Felsen appears at page 38 of the appendix?
MRo KELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And there, as I read it, there is no

mention of a liability based on fraud*,
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Not a hint.
If there had been, would your ease be

significantly different?

Assuming a judgment makes no refer­

ence to fraud, which controls, the complaint or the judgment?
MRo KELLER:

I believe the judgment controls,

because -»
QUESTION:

If there had been an allegation of fraud

and no mention of it in the consent judgments your argument
would be the same, I take it?
MR0 KELLER:

It would be weaker, but it would be

essentially the same0
QUESTION:

Then what the Tenth Circuit is saying in

effect is that If Brown did not affirmatively erossel&im
against Felsen in the state court based on fraud, the Bankruptcy

20
Court cannot exercise Its power under the

'70 anendments to

decide independently or de novo, whatever you wa.nt to call it,
whether or not that particular debt was obtained by fraud..
MRo KELLER:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

The Tenth

Circuit 1 think relied on the difference between a consent
judgment and a judgment by default on the one hand, and I
believe they referred to U.S. v. Armour, in which Justice
Marshall — and 1 quoted it in my brief — talked at length
about a consent judgment, and it is a waiver to litigate the
issue.
QUESTION:

Well, what issue?

The issue was never

raised.
MR® KELLER:
QUESTION:

The issue of fraud.
The issue was — typically., a creditor

going against a debtor or a guarantor going against the
person whom he guaranteed, if h® feels the person he
guaranteed Is solvent, just wants a judgment«

He doesn’t care

whether it is based on a contract or fraud or something else,
and the fact that he fails to urge the ground of fraud would
not ordinarily be thought of as a waiver in some subsequent
proceeding.
MR® KELLER:

When he stipulates in a judicial sense

and enters into a consent judgment based entirely on contract
and indemnity, entirely on that, he has waived his right to
any —

21
That is only if you can say it is a

QUESTION;

classical res judicata is applicable and that anything that
was litigated or might have been litigated is foreclosedc,
Isn't that true?
MR. KELLER:

That is certainly one of the situations0

I think this is a classic case of res judicata.,
QUESTION:

Well, that Is

a rather stringent stand­

ard to apply in view of the *70 amendments to the Bankruptcy
Act, don’t you think?
MRs KELLER:

Well, the *70 amendments, do they really

change the substantive law or do they simply change the pro­
cedure?

Now, in Grady va Nicholas, Justice McWilliams, of

our Tenth Circuit, said that the '70 amendments clean up the
procedural aspects but don’t really change the substantive
law of bankruptcy.

That is what the Tenth Circuit has said,

in a case some five or six years ago, and essentially that is
probably true.

/

/

/

Interestingly enough, even in the 1970 amendments,
nothing is said by Congress as to what happens when a state
court proceeding is finished, because there are four situations
in which one can find himself:

Situation one is where no state

proceeding has ever been commenced*

Therea of course, the

creditor has a clean shot to litigate the fraud question;

The

second situation is where there is a state ease pending at
the time the petition in bankruptcy is filed.

Now, the statute

22

deals with that, in section

c{'4}0

The Congress specifically

said that when a state court case is pending and a complaint
is filed on non-dischargeability for fraud, the proceedings
are stayed.

The Congress specifically spoke to that.

Interestingly enough, when it comes tc the situation
such as we have, where a state court proceeding has been con­
cluded in their entirety, there isn’t a word in the Bankruptcy
Act and the Congress has not dealt with the question, so it is
a wide open issue.
Well, what happens when a state court proceeding has
been concluded.

That is one of the issues in this case0

If

the creditor has properly pleaded fraud, we have one set of
circumstances.

If he has never raised it, we have another0

QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:

In a state court proceeding?
Yes, sir.

When the creditor — and this

is the essence I think of the Tenth Circuit’s position -- when
the creditor has never hinted fraud In his crossclaim or In
his complaint and has said nothing about it and permits the
case to p;o on and on and finally agrees to a consent judgment,
which under Armour & Company is identical to a litlgative
case, has he then waived his right to ever litigate fraud?
he barred by res judicata?
QUESTION:

That Is the question.

Why should there be a waiver?

really no purpose in alleging fraud in that case.
the debtor been prejudiced by his failure to do so?

There is
How has
I just

Is

23
don’t understand why he should take the trouble to Inject an
unnecessary issue into that lawsuit.
MR0 KELLER:

There are many reasons to raise fraud in

a state court proceeding0
QUESTION:

You mentioned punitive damages, but I

think you start with the proposition that this person is
pretty nearly insolvent anyway»

You have a judgment-proof

debtor here.
MR» KELLER:

In our case, it so happens that — but

let’s take the case —QUESTION:

Well, that is almost by hypothesis»

We

are dealing with people who go through bankruptcy.
MR» KELLER:

Well, they go bankrupt after the con­

clusion of the state court and that is hindsight.
QUESTION:

If they are totally solvent and could pay

the debt 100 cents on the dollar,, even then why litigate fraud
if he can sign a note and say I owe the money?

Why would you

take the trouble to raise fraud if you can get money more
quickly by settling it?
MR» KELLER:

There ares at least under Colorado law,

some additional benefits by being able to plead fraud.
Exemplary and punitive damages is one of them»

Body execu­

tion is authorised under Colorado law, and that is another.
It is admittedly rarely used, but it is one of the remedies
you have in a fraud case

QUESTION:

It is not very helpful when one of your

debtors is a corporation though,,
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Mo.
Mr. Keller, may we come back to whether

or not there was any reference to fraud in the crossclalm0
Will you take a look at page 38 of the appendix»

That is a

crossclaim, isn®t it?
MR. KELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And you said, as I understood it, that

there is not a word in it with respect to the misrepresenta­
tion»

What about the first sentence under the word "Prelimin­

ary”

"hereby Incorporated by reference his previous Answer

as if fully set forth herein»"
MR„ KELLER:

Well, that was the previous answer, and

I am not sure —
QUESTION:

The previous answer is on page 3^, as I

understand it, and on page 35, in paragraph 3, under "Affirma­
tive Defenses," as the Chief Justice read to you, it seems to
him and to me that that suggests that misrepresentation was
charged with respect to all of the defendants.
QUESTION:

Also paragraph 5 on page 36.

QUESTION:

Paragraph 5 is the one I read to you, Mr»

Keller,
MRo KELLER:

And that is the one I am referring to,

and that is included in the affirmative defense, which uses

25

loose language, "misrepresentations and non-disclosures of
material facts" which is incorporated by reference in the pre­
liminary sentence on page 38,

But in the Tenth Circuit

opinion and in our brief9 we refer to the Colorado Rules of
Civil Procedure and the case of Morrison v. Gooc:speeds which
specifically set forth how you plead fraud.

This is in our

judgment nothing.
QUESTION;

Your position now is that although it is

mentioned in the cross complaint;, it isn8t properly pled?
MR. KELLER;
QUESTION;

Well, I would say, yes, it is mentioned.
It is incorporated by reference,, whatever

he said in the —

But to say —
But you say It is not properly pledc
But to say that paragraph 5 on page 36

is an allegation of frauds I don’t construe
QUESTION:
MR. KELLER:

Paragraphs 3 and 5, yes.
I don’t construe it that way»

justly unfair and unconscionable and overreaching.

He says
To say

that that is a pleading of fraud Is going a long ways.

The

Tenth Circuit applying the law of Colorado and Its own rejected
that argumento
QUESTION:

Well, how much more do you need to say in

26
a pleading to make out a fraud claim than to say that this was
done by misrepresentation and non-disclosure of material facts?
MRt> KELLER:
QUESTION:

Under —
What rule of Colorado —

MRo KELLER:

Rule 9(b) of the Colorado Rules of

Civil Procedure -QUESTION:

Is it in here anywhere?

MR0 KELLER:

Yes* sir, it is on page five of our

brief* about two-thirds of the way down0
stated with particularity0"

It says ’’shall be

And then we have the case of

Morrison v. Ooodspeed, which is a Colorado case* which sets
out what you have to plead* and the Tenth Circuit — and Judge
Barratt wrote the opinion -- applied those rules in reaching
its decision»
So we say that in our case, in the case at bar* the
question of fraud is an after-thought, coming after the com­
pletion of all prior proceedings, the state court had already
acted, the creditor did not perfect his rights in those state
court proceedings, and simply the creditor wants a second bite
at an apple which never existed because there was no fraud
properly urged in the state proceeding.
Thank you.

27
ORAL ARGUMENT OP CRAIG A0 CHRISTENSEN, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Very briefly, Your Honor.

Mro Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
First, Mr. Keller suggests that the word "exclusive" with
respect to the subject matter Jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy
Court under section 17 does not appear in the statute.
is true.

That

But I would cite to the Court section 17c(2) which

is mandatory to a creditor0

It says a creditor who contends

that his debt is not discharged, under clause {2}, (4), or (8) of
subdivision

a

— and we are dealing here only with sections

(2) and (4) — must file an application for determination of
dischargeability within the time fixed by the court.

Then It

goes on in subsection (3) and requires that court to hold a
hearing upon notice and to determine dischargeability.
I really don8t think that there is much dispute that
the exclusive jurisdiction for th© determination of this type
of dischargeability lies in the Bankruptcy Courts
QUESTION:

Well, it may be so, that you have to go
\

to the court, but the questions what are the ingredients of
that decision.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice White.

You seem to concede yourself that if the

whole case turned on a fact that had been determined against
the creditor in the state proceeding , there wouldn’t be much

28
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Courta
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

If the issue had been determined

against the debtor?
QUESTION:

If it had been determined against the

creditors If there is a crucial fact determined against the
creditor who is claiming non-dischargeahilitey, there wouldn’t
be much of a proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court, would there?
MRo CHRISTENSEN:

No.

I think there would be

collateral estoppel if as a matter of fact it was determined
that
)

QUESTION:

Even though it was exercising exclusive

jurisdiction?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

That's correct, and in the exer­

cise of that jurisdiction the facts that had been previously
determined in litigation would be —
QUESTION:

Counsel was just suggesting that that is

the case here, that if you want to have the Bankruptcy Ccurt
— that you can get the Bankruptcy Court to exercise its
exclusive jurisdiction here, too, it just happens to be bound
by the state court»
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I understand that contention.

would disagree with that contention, for two reasons:

X

Number

one, 1 don’t; believe that those Issues ever were raised or
litigated in the state court, so that those facts, wherever
found -- he is not contending the facts were found adverse to

29
to my client; he is contending my client waived his right to
ever have those .facts determined,,

That is really the issue

before the court, whether my client waived a federal right by
failing to pursue a state right, and I believe that the best
analogy that I can suggest to the Court is had Mr. Brown
received stock and the same pleadings would have been filed
in the state could, would he have waived all of his rights to
any securities law violations for which exclusive Jurisdic­
tion was placed in the Federal District Courts0
QUESTION:

What if the creditor sues in the state

court for fraud?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

And if it is actually litigated, I

think those facts are binding.

If it is by default Judgment,

then ~~
QUESTION:

Let me suggest to you9 what if he gets a

judgment for fraud?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

It depends on the nature of that

j udgment 0
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Yes.

And can he file it as a claim?
The Ninth Circuit has dealt

with that —
QUESTION:

And what if there are no assets and then

he wants a determination of dischargeability?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Well, the —

Would the Bankruptcy Court redetermine the

30

legal questiem of fraud?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I think that if it had actually

been litigated s it would redetermine to the extent that the
facts ~QUESTION:

Fraud is my question

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

— found don’t reach the standards

of section 17.
QUESTION;

So you say it works both ways?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Both w&ya, I mean the legal issue of

fraud, would never bind the Bankruptcy Courts even if the
creditor had gotten a judgment for fraud in the state court?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Not the legal test, that’s correct.

The facts found -- if the facts were found that a material
misrepresentation was mades that fact would be binding-, but
the state court determination of fraud under its state stand­
ards® pleading requirements would'not bind the federal court’s
determination of federal lav- for non*dischargeabilitye
QUESTION:

Has there been a lot of cases on this?

MRo CHRISTENSEN:

1 believe that there have been

five since the 1370 amendments that have reached the circuits.
QUESTION:

And is there some general view about

whether there is a national standard or not?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I believe that four of the five

circuits to reach the question have allowed the Bankruptcy

31
Court to consider the matter again, with extensive evidence.
QUESTION:

What about the standard?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

QUESTION:

The standard applied —

is it a national standard?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I donet know that either courts

have ever addressed that question.

They always talk in terms

of the federal act, but they never say specifically whether
that federal act is being interpreted in light of state stand­
ards or not;, Mr. Justice White.

The closest indication would

come out of the Ninth Circuit, the Houtman ease.

There fraud

was actually litigated and determined to exist, and the
debtor went into Bankruptcy Courta the credit presented that
case and the Ninth Circuit said, no, that may be prlma facie,
but it is not going t© be the standard exclusive, we are
going to let the debtor raise additional evidence0
r

QUESTION:

That is close the example I gave you.

MR. CHRISTENSENs

Yes, that is the closest one to

the —
QUESTION:

You said four out of five, what about

the fifth?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

The fifth is the Tenth Circuit,

that is this case.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

MRo CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

So it is contrary.

You haven’t specifically backed up to

32
this rule 9(b).

How do you think that enters into the case?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

The Colorado Rule of Procedure?

Yes.

MR® CHRISTENSEN:

I think two observations are

necessary there, Mr® Chief Justice.

First of all, I must

concede to this Court that the cross claim, itself doe3 not ask
for any relief based specifically on fraud, and it does not
ask for the extraordinary type of remedy, of punitive damages
or bodily execution that Blight be available for fraud.

So

where the case turning solely on whether fraud had been pled
in accordance with that rule, I am not certain that it
absolutely has been.

I believe it has.

It talks in terms of

misrepresentation, it identifies the misrepresenting parties,
it states that the facts are material, and I think the impli­
cation, although not stated, is that there was reliance that
the guarantee would have been executed®
But the second and more Important thing is I don't
think that federal rights ought to turn on the various fifty
standards In the states for fraud and their pleading require­
ments.

I don't think that —
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Because I think the fresh start

provisions are probably the most essential ingredient to a
bankrupt®

If he doesn't obtain the fresh start, there is

little or no benefit for him to seek the protection of the

33
Act.

Arid to make those fresh start provisions turn upon

where he has his residence at the time of the filing of the
petition —
QUESTION:

It did before 1970, didn't it?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Absolutely»

Wall., you concede that if the issue of

fraud had been fully litigated that there would be a collateral
estoppel»
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Only on the facts»

Only on the facts»

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

That's correct, because as I

understand it, collateral estoppel would only go to facts
found»

Res judicata goes to the identicality of the legal

Issue —•
QUESTION:

You would say the state decision could

have — they could have concluded there was fraud under state
lav; and the federal court could determine there wasn't any
fraud or that there was, regardless of what the state court
concluded on the facts?
MR» CHRISTENSEN:

That's correct, because the legal

standards may be different.
QUESTION:

But it would have to be on the basis of a

different legal standard, not on an overturning of the factual
determination.
MR» CHRISTENSEN:

I think that’s correct»

To the

34
extent the facts have been litigated, 1 believe the parties
have to live with them.

But to the extent that the legal

standards are different, the Bankruptcy Court has a federal
obligation to apply its own standards.

Obviously, Mr» Justice

White, it has begged the question to assume that those will
he national standards instead of state standards0
one of the questions this Court must decide»

That is

But I would argue

that the better rule is to allow the parties to be bound by
the facts and to allow the Bankruptcy Court to make this
separate legal determination, etherise you fore® the
creditors in every single case to plead and prove or other­
wise dispose of fraud just to preserve a federal right for
those few cases in which bankruptcy actually happens®

And

for that reason I would ask that this Court vacate the Tenth
Circuit judgment and allow the petitioner to proceed»
QUESTION:

You don't »«- 1 take it you don't -- do

you think there is anything specific in that legislative
history?
MR, CHRISTENSEN:

It is cited in the brief, Mr,

Justice White, the legislative history, and
QUESTION:

But is there something specific that

reads right on it or not?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I’m sorry, I didn't hear your

question»
QUESTION:

Is there something that reads right on it

35
out of the legislative history?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I think that in the brief, at page

7S it talks —
QUESTION;

Page 7 to 9 is where you deal 'with it.

MR, CHRISTENSEN:

— it talks about exclusive

jurisdiction at the very top, where we cite the Senate and the
House reports.
4

QUESTION:

But that doesn't get you very far along

the line, does it?
MR, CHRISTENSEN:

With respect to the federal as

opposed to state standards?
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

No, there Is nothing in the legis­

lative history that makes that definitive statement as It
does about exclusive jurisdiction»
QUESTION:

Or it doesn’t help you one way or another

with respect to collateral estoppel,
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
think

Well* 1 think it does, because I

not on collateral estoppel, but on res judicata, I

don’t believe that that is binding if the first court had no
subject matter jurisdiction, and If Congress intended and did
in fact, as they state, put exclusive subject matter jurisdic­
tion In the Bankruptcy Court* I don’t think res judicata would
apply.
The Colorado courts -•* and we have cited these cases

36
in our brief —» have specifically said they lack subject
matter jurisdiction to determine dischargeability Issues.
QUESTION;

But that is a post-bankruptcy determina­

tione
MR. CHRISTENSEN?
QUESTION s

That9s correct.

Yes.

MR. CHRISTENSEN?

I think it would be applicable in

a pre-bankruptcy if you pled your case in terms of a federal
dischargeability instead of a state remedy for which they had
jurisdiction»
Thank you.
