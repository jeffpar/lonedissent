MR. CHIEF JUSTICS BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

Mr, Roth, you may proceed

whenever you are ready,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARNOLD I, ROTH. ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRo ROTH:

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:
Section 17(a) the the Securities and Exchange Act of
193^ requires broker-dealers to make such reports as the SEC may
require , Section 18(a) provides an expressed damage remedy to
purchasers and sellers of securities who relied upon misstate­
ments in those Section 17(a) reports.
The primary issue hers is whether, in light of the
limited expressed damage remedy in Section 18(a)* whether Section
17(a) itself also provides an additional implied private right
of action in favor of customers of brokerage firms who are not
purchasers and sellers against accountants who audit the Section
17(a) reports that contained the misstatements.
There are also two subsidiary issues here which the
Court need reach only if it does find that Section 17(a) creates
an implied private right of action.

The first of those subsidi­

ary questions is whether a trustee* liquidating the business of
a defunct brokerage firm pursuant to the Securities Investors
Protection Act of 1970, is entitled to assert the Section 17(a)

4
rights of action that belong to customers of the brokerage firm
whose property he has been unable to return in the course of the
liquidation»
The second subsidiary issue is whether customers of the
brokerage firm who have been compensated with money obtained from
the securities Investor Protection Corporation retain any Section
17(a) rights, and if so is SXPC subrogated to those rights?
It is the position of Petitioner Touche Ross that there
is no implied right of action under Section 17(a) in favor of
brokerage firm customers or anyone else* and that such a right of
action would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme» the evi­
dent legislative intent and the purposes of the statute»■
It is also our position that even if you assume there
to be such an implied right of action* that neither the trustee
nor SIPC may assert that-action*
Now, this case and those issues arise out of the failure
in May of 1973 of a brokerage firm called Weis Securities and its
subsequent liquidation under the Securities Investment Protection
Act or SIPA , as I will refer to it*
Weis at that time was a member of the New York Stock
Exchange and had approximately 35*000 customers»

In April or May

of 1973* the S,1C and the New York Stock exchange learned that
officers of Weis had been falsifying the books and financial
records of Weis, so as to conceal a deteriorating financial con­
dition

5
The officers" scheme had commenced in early 1972 and
had continued on until the spring of 1973»

Upon discovery of the

scheme in May of *73* upon SXPC's application,, the District Court
in the Southern District of New York ordered the liquidation of
Weis and appointed the trustee a

The liquidation is on-going and

31 PC is said to have advanced $14 million in that liquidation for
the purpose of paying off customer claims.
Among the reports falsified by the Weis officers were
the Weis financial reports for its fiscal year ending May 26, 1972*
reports for a year ending about a year before the actual liquida­
tion,. reports which were filed with the S.3C pursuant to Section
17(a) of the 1934 Act- and the implementing regulation. Rule 17(a)
(5).
Touche Ross} the Petitioner here, performed the annual
audit with respect to those reports, but the audit failed to
detect the misstatements in those reports.
According to the trustee in S1PC here in this case,
Touche Ross failed to detect the misstatement because its audit
i^as conducted in a negligent, reckless, careless, unskilled and
grossly negligent manner.
It is also asserted that because the misstatements went
undetected the Weis officers were enabled to continue until spring
of f73 their scheme of concealing the ever-increasing losses that
were the result of the mismanagement by those officers,
3 IPG and the Trustee also allege that had Touche Ross

«V

6
discovered the misstatements* effective remedial action could have
been taken so that the forced liquidation could have been avoided
or its consequences reduced»
On the basis of those assertions. SIPC and the Trustee
commenced two separate lawsuits against Touche Ross»
QUidTION:
appear below

At that point* Mr, Roth* did the Government

fid the United States Government appear below in

any capacity at all?
MR, ROTH:

Your Honor, the SIC appeared in the Second

QUESTION:

And they are not here, however?

MR, ROTH:

They are not here* Your Honor,

QUESTION:

Is there any significance in that?

MR, ROTH:

I believe there is significance* Your Honor,

QUESTION:

Mr, Roth, I didn't understand.

Circuit»

What posi-

fcion did they take below* the SiC?
MR, ROTH:
this action because

Your Honor, the District Court dismissed
on the ground that the.Section 17(a)

claims of the Trustee and SIPC failed to state a claim for re­
lief because Section 17(a) does not imply remedy for anybody.
It also dismissed the common law claims for accountants' mal­
practice, and so forth, that the Trustee and SIPC asserted, for
lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
On appeal to the Second Circuit, SIPC and the Trustee
sought reversal and the SIC came in in support of SIPC's position

7
In addition to this action,, the other action that was
commenced by SIPC and the Trustee was a state court action that
was commenced about ten months before this one in the New York
state courts,,

Oxeept for the few conclusory allegations in this

action, which the Trustee and SIPC deemed necessary in order to
assert claims under Section 17(a) of the '34 Act* the complaints
are exactly identical, same parties, same facts, same allegations,
same damages, everything.
QUESTION:

The customers are not a party to either law­

suit — no customer is a party to either lawsuit?
MR. ROTH:

No customers are party to either lawsuit.

The customers have their own lawsuit?®;going»
QUESTION:

Have they been paid by SIPC?

MR. ROTH:

Your Honor, I think most of the customers

have been paid off in the liquidation.

$14 million of the

amount that was necessary to pay them back was put in by SIPC,
subject to its — in accordance with its obligations under the
Act SI PA a
QUESTION:

The customers have been paid dollar for

dollar, have they?
MR. ROTH:

Your Honor, I don't know that every single

customer has been paid dollar for dollar.

There are, in fact —

I know that there are some who have not been.

I believe that

there are some customers who had property at Weis which is over
the limits of the amounts for which SIPC is obligated to make

8
goodo

Those amounts subsequently have been raised, and 1 think

if the new amounts had been in affect in 1972 there would have
been even fewer that were not paid*
Your Honor, to finish up the question, the customers
have suits primarily in the state court.

Of course, about six

days after the Second Circuit came down with its decision, saying
for the first time in forty-fiva years that Section 17(a) does
create an implied private right of action in favor of brokerage
firm customers, they started an action in the Southern District»
That action is presently being stayed pending this appeal»
QUESTION:

Those customers who were paid off dollar

for dollar hardly have been damaged, have they?
MR„ ROTH:

Your Honor, there is another lawsuit which

Touche Ross is not a party to, but there is a decision in the
Second Circuit saying that even customers who have been paid off
in full by the Trustee still have causes of action that they can
assert for the kinds of damages that are not compensated by SIPC,
that is losses on the inability to get their shares back when
they wanted them, certain tax consequences that flowed from having
to —»
QUESTION:

Against whom?

This action is against whom?

MR» ROTH:

That action was commenced against the New York

Stock Exchange and a brokerage firm that the Stock Exchange and
the SEC tried to have Weis merge with in the last days of its
existence

9
.In the Second Circuit* there was a reversal by a divided
court of the District Court's dismissal of this action.

The Second

Circuit held, first, that there was an implied right of action,
under Section 17(a)* for the customers.

It held that the Trustee

and SIPC, who had been asserting that they could ~~ that they had
a claim under Section 17(a) in their own right, did not have such
a right,
However, the Second Circuit did say that the Trustee,
as the bailee of customer property, could assert the Section I?
(a) rights of customers whose property the Trustee had been unable
to return in the liquidation0
The Second Circuit also said that SXPC* having advanced
money for the payment of certain customers’ claims
QUESTION:

M.r0 Roth* was there any cross-petition on

the part of Redington or SXPC from the decision of the Court of
Appeals?
MR, ROTH:

Yes, sir,

They both cross-petitioned.

Those cross-petitions -»
QUESTION:

Are still pending?

MR, ROTH:

As far as we know, yes,

QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals held that the customers

had a private right of action under 17(a), and that these two
Respondents here had derivifcivs causes of action only,one as a
bailee, the other as a subrogate.
MR, ROTH:

Yes, sir

10

Judge Mulligan in the Second Circuit filed a vigorous
dissenti in which he dessented from all of the findings or the
holdings of the majority, except that he agreed with them that
neither SIPC nor the Trustee had any claims in their own righto
The crucial element in the statutory scheme here, of
course, is the existence of Section 18(a), which already provides
an expressed damage remedy to a certain class for misstatements
in Section 17(a) reports.
Section 18 provides a remedy, like many other remedies
in the 193^ Act, only to purchasers and sellers of securities
who relied upon the misstatements.

The presence of Section 18(a)

in the statutory scheme reflects an apparent congressional in­
tention that a damage remedy for such misstatements would toe
available only to purchasers and sellers as specified in Section
18(a). and would seem to require the conclusion that it would toe
improper to apply an additional and broader remedy under Section
17(a), Itself, in favor of people who are not purchasers or
sellers„
QUESTION:

Of course, that's quite a different group

of people for quite a different kind of damage, isn’t it?

In

other words, these people here are customers of the brokerage
firm 6
MR„ ROTH:

Yes, sir,

QUESTION:

And their problem is that the brokerage

firm, through some ..chicanery, went busted®

The other remedy

II
to which you refer has to do with purchasers and sellers of
securities whose damage results from misinformation or wrong­
doing on the part of the issuers of those securities which they
purchase or sell, which is quite a different cause of action,
quite a different group of protected people, quite a different
kind of damage,
MR, ROTH:

Your Honor» I think what you have done is

to state the conclusion in a different way than I have just
stated.

Section 18(a) does not give to the customers a right

of action.

It only gives it to the purchasers themselves.
Now, they have lost property in this debacle of this

brokerage firm,
QUESTION:

Not because of anything they have purchased

or sold on the Stock fxchang^e or elsewhere, but just because
their broker went busted,
MR, ROTH:

That’s right.

Now, Your Honor, the question that we have to decide
today is whether they ought to have a right of action,

I

think,

though, that/you have to start from the premise that if Congress
were worried in 193^ about purchasers and sellers -:-.uand we know
they were because the f31' Act is filled with purchaser and seller
remedies »- and if they were also concerned at that time, as my
opponents say, with brokerage firm customers — I am going to get
to the legislative history that shows you this is just not so
but the Second Circuit says brokerage firm customers are the

12

favored wards of Section 17»

If that's so, then what you. have

is the situation where Congress, knowing about both of these
groups, gives the purchasers and sellers an expressed remedy and
doesn't give anything to the brokerage firm customers.
So you. start almost logically from the proposition
that they gave one something, they didn't give the. other something
and they must have intended not to give it.
Now, I think, Your Honor, that that does bring us to ,
the cases that I say set forth the appropriate analysis for
determining whether there ought to be or ought not be a private
right of action for these customers.
Those cases are Amtrak, Barber, and Blue Chip Stamps,
which deal specifically with the question of implying remedies
from statutes that already have expressed remedies in then.
And, of course, Amtrak and Barber hold that the congressional
enactment of a limited expressed remedy for violation of a par=
ticular statutory provision is probative and compelling evidence
of a legislative intent to preclude a broader implied remedy.
Now, the implied remedy that you would get from 17(a)
is broader than the one in 18(a).

It is a remedy for customers,

not for purchasers and sellers, the typical people whom the 193^
Act was to protect.
QUESTION:

But those cases, did they not -- maybe

they didn't — involved explicitly conferred statutory remedies.
And the claim in each of those cases was that in addition to those

13

explicitly conferred statutory remedies there were other implied
private causes of action as sanctions against the same category
of wrongdoingo
Here* we have quite -» two different categories of wrong­
doing, don't we?

One would be wrongdoing on the part of issuers

of securities that are bought, and sold, purchased and sold by
Investors in the securities market* and the other* quite a dif­
ferent wrongdoing in this case which is alleged wrongdoing on the
part of a brokerage firm vis-a-vis its own customers .
MR, ROTH:

Yes, in a way. that is so, but J think, Your

Honor, that I should take you to show you the substitute that
Congress thought it was giving customers in place of the private
remedy that was given to purchasers and sellers.
In the legislative history of the 193^- Act — that 's
where I would Ilk® to start — it makes no mention of a private
right of action under Section 17(a).

It talks only about the

administrative enforcement by the SRC, about the SRC going in
inspecting brokers and dealers.
thing to it, though, Your Honor,

It does have one revealing
There is a statement in the

legislative history that makes it clear that the SRC investiga­
tions were investigations so that they could go in and get evi­
dence rapidly in any case where fluctuations in the price of a
security indicate that manipulation may be in progress.
Now, that's the kind of thing that purchasers and
sellers are concerned about.

And so the only indicia as to who

14

was the special beneficiary of Section 17(a), in the legislative
history of the c34 Act, is that it was purchasers and sellers
and not so much the customers.
However, then you come to 1970# when Congress enacted
SIPA.

Now, that legislative history refers to certain protec­

tions for customers, although it did not refer to any implied
right of action.

Those protections that it was referring to

were the preventive monitoring system that was in its infancy
and then was made much broader by SIPA, itself, the investiga­
tive, injunctive and criminal powers of the SEC to enforce its
own rights under Section 17(a) to enforce compliance by the
brokerage industry with 17(a).
state law

And it was talking also about

the right to go into the state courts and use

traditional state law remedy0
In fact, the House report refers to some safeguards,
however, on both the state and federal levels, as well as in
industry imposed legislation.

But the most significant thing

is that the Senate report explicitly stated that brokerage firm
customers, in this situation that Your Honor ha® referred to,
have no remedy available to them under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.
The Senate report says "apart from the volunatary
trust funds, there is no protection presently available under
existing securities laws for the investor whose broker goes
bankrupt."

And it also-said, "Neither statute prevents the

investor from losing his entire investment if his broker fails,"

15
a recognition that there were some protections, but that the
customer didn't have any protection* he didn't have an implied
right of action.

There was nowhere he could go sue for this

thing.
And here, Your Honor

and this-is a most significant

thing in this case <=■» what Congress did was to enact SIPA and
to create SIPC, with the function, not only of being part of the
early-warning regulatory preventive monitoring system* but with
the function of paying off customers of failed brokerage firms.
QUESTION:

Whether or not there was any fraud?

MR. ROTH:

That's exactly right* Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And, of course, those committee reports

were a little mistaken, at least taking them on their statements*
because customers did* in fact* have remedies.

They had remedies

under the Federal Bankruptcy Act and they undoubtedly had remedies
at state law.
MR. ROTH:

Well, Your Honor* 1 think that if you read

those statements in the context that they occurred, I think it is
perfectly clear that they were talking about they didn't have any
'33 or '34 Act remedy.

Senator Muskle says* "There still exists

a serious gap in our securities laws."
that gap.

And he was talking about

They then enact SIPA and create SIPC for that purpose.

And* Your Honor ==•
QUESTION:

But even if there is an implied remedy* you

still would have needed SIPA — Even if there is an implied

16

remedy for fraud, you still would have needed SXPA to take care
of the non**fraud bankruptcy situation,
MR» ROTH:

Well, Your Honor, that may be,

QUESTION:

Well, it is, isn't it?- That's exactly what

you are talking about and what you read ~=* non-fraud situation,
MR* ROTH:

But, Your Honor, I think there still is —

even when you take cars of the non-fraud situation you are taking
care of the fraud situation*
In other words. Your Honor., purchasers and sellers of
securities don't have any agency they can go to and get money
from if they lose money, having reli<ad on misstatements —
■ QUESTION:

Could you explain this to me*

Could you

give me an example of a violation of 17(a) by a broker that
would give rise to litigation by a purchaser or seller, where he
could recover,
MR, ROTH:

Yes, sir.

In fact, Your Honor, we have one

in the Southern District arising out of this very same Weis.
situation, in which we are the Defendant,
A bank which made a subordinated loan to Weis was given
the Weis Section 17(a) report in order to induce him to make that
loan.

He made the loan.

And Judge Wyatt, the same judge that

dismissed this action, . ---upheld a Section 18(a) claim against
Touche Ross, based on that,
QUESTION:
of securities?

They treated the bank as what, a purchaser

17

MR. ROTH:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

There wouldn't be a claim by a common

ordinary person just buying and selling stock over the exchange,
would there?

That's a rather unusual -~

MRo'ROTH:

Your Honor, that's hard to imagine because

the purchasers and sellers -- and you know a customer is a pur­
chaser and seller»
person»

I mean we are talking about almost the same

But a purchaser and seller Is dealing in stocks of

General Motors, United States Steel.

He is not going to buy and

sell them In reliance on a Weis report.
QUESTION:

That's right.

That's why 18(a) primarily

deals with misstatements that relate to the issuer of the security,
doesn't it?
MR0 ROTH:

No, Your Honor.

Section 18(a) deals with

misstatements in any report that is filed»

It is not called

liability for purchasers and sellers or liability

QUESTION:

or remedy

I find it difficult to imagine a case --

Say I am a customer of Weis and I get a false report about Weis'
financial situation.

I go out and buy General Motors stock.

The

two just don't fit.
MR» ROTH:

That's exactly right. Your Honor.

And that's

part of the crux of this problem, Your Honor.
You see, when you talk about a prospectus or a proxy
statement, that is something that goes primarily to the Investor

18

and is primarily designed to induce him fco act or not act.

Those

documents do go to the SEC * but the SEC is really exercising an
oversight kind of function and it is important that your actions
be made on accurate statement.

And there is a congressional

policy for that.
On the other hand* these Section 17(a) reports* particularly in 1972* ware primarily for the purpose of going to
the SEC and going to the regulatory agencies and were not de­
signed for the basic purpose of inducing an investor fco make a
decision based thereon.
Now* it might be that one gets out into commerce some­
where and somebody does purchase or sell a security.
MR. CHIEF ,JUSTICE BURGER:

I think you have completed

your answer fco the question* Mr. Roth* and your time has expired.
MR. ROTH:

Thank you* Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Forlenza.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP R. FORLENZA * ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SIPC
MR. FORLENZA:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

feha Court:
I would like to go directly to the heart of Petitioner's
case and pick up on the points raised by Mr. Justice Stewart and
Mr. Justice Stevens.
The fact of the matter is that there is no situation
where a customer has a claim under Section 18(a) for anything

19

that happened regarding violations of Section 17«

The fact of

the matter is that Section 1J and Section 18 may well travel
separate roads that intersect at times,, but they go beyond that
to attain different goals, to protect different categories of
investors .
QUESTION:

Mr. Forlenza, is there any substantial dif­

ference between the position of your client, SIPC, and the posi­
tion of Redington, the Trustee?
MR. FORLENZA:
QUESTION:

On the merits?

On the issues before this Court on Touche

Ross8 petition for certiorari.
MR. FORLENZA:

No, sir.

The question, I think, that has been asked is -QUESTION:

Except you are here as a subrogate and

there is the ultimate question of whether or not •— and your cocounsel represents an asserted bailee, and there is a question
of whether or not he has standing in that capacity.
extent, you are different cases.

So, to that

Because, basically, as I under­

stand the Court of Appeals' judgment, neither you, your client,
nor his client has a right of action on his own.

Isn't that

correct?
MR. FORLENZA:

That!s correct.

Actually, I don't think they raised -»
QUESTION:

But it's only a customer's right of action.

MR. FORLENZA:

That's right.

20

1 don't think the Court of Appeals made such a holding1 think in a footnote it suggested it wasn't particularly recep­
tive to It.

1 think that’s more accurate.

The fact of the matter is we are here in those
capacities.
QUESTION:

But the court held .it is a customer’s right

of action.
I
MR. FORLENZA :

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And further held that you and he*for dif­

ferent reasons^ have standing to assert that right of action A

\

•

\\

MR. FORLENZA:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And was that the position of the Commission

in the Court of Appeals?
MR. PORLENZA:

That's correct., that customers do have

standing under Section 17(a).
QUESTION:

Do you know whether the Commission's brief

filed in the Court of Appeals is part of the record here?
MR. PORLENZA:
QUESTION:

I am. not sure it Is part of the record.

But they haven't filed their own brief

here now?
MR. PORLENZA;

No.

And I must say that I take issiije
i,\

with Mr. Roth's contention that their absence is significantI

f

u

think-their record, their position in the cases# is as in the
/
second Circuit-. They have not taken a different position in thii
Court.

I

1

We don't know the reason for their non-participation at M

%

21
this level.
If I may pick up again on the point about 18.
the question that has to be asked is:

I think

Why should customers be

denied a right of action against accountants who violate Section
17 and Rule 17(a)(5)* not withstanding the egregiousness of the
conduct of the broker or accountant» or the extent of the damage?
Now* Mr. Roth says few© things*

Number one* congressional

silence back in 1974 as to a private right of action is some kind
of evidence.
QUESTION:

1934?

MR. FORLENZA:

1934.

I think this Court has said time and again that
congressional silence* particularly t\rhen there is no pending or
proposed legislation., is evidence of very little.
QUESTION:

You say the question Is why should customers

be denied this right of action?

Certainly that isn't the way

you would ordinarily phrase the question when you are in a
federal court* is it?
MR. FORLENZA:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist* my point was

addressed to the arguments that Mr. Roth was making.
that they have such a right.

Under Section 17* they are the in­

tended beneficiaries of that statute.
a violation of the statute.

We contend

They have been harmed by

Under the Cort v„ Ash* or any other

test* be it Amt re. k or Barber* there is no legislative intent to
the contrary* and it is consistent with the legislative purpose.
4

2?

QUESTION:

But you are not contending it's an expressed

cause of action?
MR, FQRLENZA:

Absolutely not.

So, the question is, should this Court imply a private
right of action?
The Petitioner says it ought not to, not because of any

QUESTION:

Here again, we've implied It before from

time to time, but we perhaps haven't always followed it,

Congress

knows how to state a cause of action.
You have to rest on the general contours of what we
said in Cort v. Ash and soma of the other cases,
MR, FQRLENZA:

Absolutely,

And the fact of the matter

is that I think in Cort v0 Ash the Court recognized that there
are times when Congress creates the duty, does not address the
remedy, other than placing it in the hands of the Commission,
for example, and it is the function of this Court,when the Sort
v» Ash factors are met, to imply a remedy, as it did in Section
14(a) in Borak —
QUESTION:

Then in the Piper casg, which is more

recent, it was indicated, certainly, that some necessity must
be shown,

It is necessary to do it, or else there is no remedy

whatever,
MR, FQRLENZA:
let me say this,

Well, on the question of necessity,

I think as to the necessary supplement to

23
Commission action, which is the phraseology used by this Court
on several occasions, there is no question that the Commission
or the exchanges was ever intended to have the resources or
ability to conduct the kinds of audits that are required to
expose brokers15 fraud in hiding net capital violation»

“The

fact of the matter is it is common knowledge these kinds of
audits take hundreds and hundreds of man-hours»

The Commission

hasn't got the ability or the resources to conduct those»
Number two, Mr» Roth talks about the fact there are
customers in this case represented by the Trustee who have
claims;

of losses in excess of $1 million, because they were

over the limit of the SIPC fund»

It is necessary to imply a

private right of action to compensate those customers»
I'll get back to the Section 18 point»

My adversary

says that the reason for denying a private right of action to
customers notwithstanding Section 17, the duty on the accountants
set forth there and in the rule is not because of any clear legis­
lative intent, but the maxim of expressio unius in this Court's
decision in Amtrak»
But, as Mr, Justice Stewart pointed out, in Amtrak and
Barber< there was a statute directly on point, giving to a cer»
tain party

» in that case, the Government and a very limited

class of private parties — a remedy for the very wrong question»
Here, 18 deals with filed information which has an adverse effect
on the price of a security, that is to say fraudulent statements

24

Section 17 doesn't address that kind of situation,
When Congress made the contours of a Section 18 claims it made
all the sense in the world? for the same reasons as Blue Chip? to
require a purchaserseller requirement as a limitation.
limitation makes sense in a customer claim.

No such

Indeed* it's not a

limitation on a remedy* it's a denial of a remedy to customers.
Turning to the intended beneficiaries,

Mr, Roth takes

issue with the fact that Section 17 has* as its intended bene­
ficiaries* the customers,
I need only point to Sections 8{b) and 15(c)(3) of
the '34 Act * which is the basis for the net capital rule* to
point out that Congress was indeed interested in protecting
customers against losses* by reason of insolvency of brokerage
houses,
Section 17 is the only mechanism for finding out about
such violations.
Secondly* for thirty-five years* the Commission has
interpreted the rule as protecting customers in just these
situations,
As recently as January of this year* the Daniels case*
the Court pointed out that a consistent and longstanding inter­
pretation by the Commission is entitled to great weight.

In

that case* the interpretation was neither longstanding nor
consistent.

(a)(5)*

That is certainly not the case here with Rule 17

25

Now* as to this legislative intent in 1970* with the
enactment of SXPA* if the Court will look closely at the Senate
report* it talked about operational difficulty in the 1960ss the
back office problem that gave rise to the demise of most of the
brokerage houses at that time*

They were not talking about

situations where accountants had failed to pick up a fraud which
exacerbated the situation with the brokerage house and resulted
in its demise.

That is to say* investor confidence had badly

And implied lawsuits* of long duration* are hardly

the kind of thing that would give investors the confidence they
required at that time»

5IPA was set up for that purpose.

The fact of the matter is* Mr, Roth overstates the
congressional intent.

There is nothing in the legislative history

to suggest that Congress even addressed the question of implied
rights against accountants.
QUESTION:

That is in 1970?

There was 8{b) in 193^s which was the

grandfather of the net capital rule.

The fact of the matter is Congress simply did not
deal with the question of whether there should be an implied —

Mr. Forlenza* on the question whether 17(a)

that* well* the real purpose of it is to help the SEC with its

SEC and they could look them over and maybe revoke a license* or
something like that.
Is it your position* in your private cause of action*
that the customers relied directly on the filed reports* or
they* in effect* didn't get the benefit of enforcement action
that would have taken place if correct reports had been filed?
MR» FORLENZA:

It is the latter* Mr® Justice Stevens®

In addition* 1 am not sure that in this kind of case reliance*
in the classic sense* is really an element here®

In Piper, for example, the fact of the matter

is the Court never reached the necessity question, because the
issue before the Court was who were the intended beneficiaries?
From the finding that the regulating parties were not the in­
tended beneficiaries, I think everything else in Piper flowed®
QUESTION:

Mr® Forlenza, may I ask one other question®

If you are wrong, and there is no private cause of action against
the accounting firm — and you take the position the accounting
firm is the key to the checking and catching these things —
what remedy is there against the accounting firm, other than
state causes of action?
MR® FORLENZA:

Other than state causes, which

Mr® Kobak will address to, there are criminal —
QUESTION:

What would their crime be?

Is there a

criminal remedy against them?

Act makes it a crime to violate any of the filing statutes or
regulations ®

So, actually, there would be a criminal =*»

QUESTION:

Against the accounting firm?

MR. FORLENZA:

Against the accounting firm®

But, as I've said before, the Court has noted that
criminal sanctions just don't work often, and this is the reason

30

for implying a private right of action*
QUESTION:

Might not the Trustee, as Trustee, have a

private cause of action, under state law, against the accounting
firm?
MR* FQRLENZA:

Mr* Justice Stewart, I am not sure of
\\

the answer*

Mr* Kobak is going to address the state law question,
%>

If I may defer to him*

\

I would like to point out that there are only certain

'4

of the customers in this lawsuit that Mr* Roth has made refer­
ence to, and that has been stayed*

Arid this Court if it decides

in favor of affirmance, I believe in that case it probably would
be dismissed because, between the two of us, we cover all the
bases *
I think the suit that Mr* Roth referred to, as giving
rise to an 18 claim, under Section 17, is worth commenting on
just for a moment.
Exchange National Bank purchased subordinated notes
from Weis of such a complicated nature that the District Court
found it was more of the nature of a security than a commercial
loan*

The complications which are highly relevant are that they

had provisions key to the Net Capital rule that were dictated by
the SEC and it was agreed that they would be part of the com­
pany's net capital*

So, of course, reliance by the Plaintiff

on the Section 17 certification was relevant -- the most rarest of
situations*

Congress could not have Intended that situation to

31

be a preclusive effect on Section 17 violations.
Thank you* very much,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr0 Kobak.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. KOBAK* JR.* ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT RESINGTON
MR, KOBAK:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:
There are customers with unsatisfied claims in the
Weia liquidation.

There are hundreds of such customers and

their claims total over $1 million.

It is essential that these

customers have a remedy when the scheme provided by Congress for
regulating broker-dealers' financial condition for the benefit
of customers does not work because of the wrongdoing of a third
party.
Here* the wrongdoing is that of the accountant.

We

allege in our complaint that the accounts I'jere not only negli­
gent* but grossly negligent and reckless in failing to follow
Rule 17(a)(5) and in failing to detect fraud* which infected the
year-end financial statements filed by Weis with the regulatory
authorities.
Now* it's true, as Mr. Roth points out in his brief*
that many* many other documents — financial documents — are
filed with the regulatory authorities by brokers in addition to
these year-end audited statements.

But there are over 5*000

brokerage firms in the United States.

The SEC* which did appear

32

beloxv* stated in its brief that it did not have time or the man­
power to conduct its own audit of more than 5$ of those 5*000
brokerage firms»
This other financial information that is furnished to
the regulatory authority is of no value* except insofar as it is
key to the audited statements that are filed annually by the
brokerage house»

As long as the monthly and other data filed by

the broker is consistent with the year-end statements, the SEC
or the stock exchanges would ordinarily have no reason to believe
that anything was wrong»

Therefore* if the audited financial

statements* which are considered the barometer of the broker's
financial condition — if they are inaccurate* the entire monitor­
ing scheme established by Congress for the benefit of investors*
in their capacity as customers* cannot work and there is a risk
that they

will be lost to individual customers* as well as to

3IPC* which is precisely what occurred in the Weis situation»
Now* Mr» Roth accuses us of trying to make accountants
scapegoats for every brokerage house liquidation»

And he sug­

gests that if Congress had wanted there to be a private right
of action against accountants it would have created one In the
Act»
Well* no one contends that accountants are the cause
of every brokerage house liquidation»
unique»

The facts here are very

They involve* ae our complaint alleges* gross negligence

in failing to detect fraud»

33
The facts of the Weis liquidation are very unique*
QUESTION:

You do have, do you not, a cause of action

under the law of the State of New York, as Trustee?
MR» KOBAK:

As Trustee, we have a derivative «’’.ause on

behalf of Weis, as a corporate entity*

That is not a cause of

action on behalf of the hundred customers.who have lost $1
million*
QUESTION:
MR0 KOBAK:

No*

But it is on behalf of the corporation?

That's correct*

QUESTION:

If it is a corporation, or partnership*

MR* KOBAK:

We have a negligence action, perhaps a

breach of contract action, under state law*
However, in addition to the fact that that cause of
action would not provide any protection for customers
QUESTION:

Except derlvitlvely*

•

If you recover, the

corporation would have more money to pay them their claims*
MR* KOBAK:

But that would be money that would be paid

to general creditors and not necessarily the customers*
The other important limitation on our state court
remedy is that, according to the accountants, we cannot rely,
even in a state court negligence action, on the rules established
by the SEC under Section 17 of the Exchange Act, because of
Section 27 of the Exchange Act, which says that the jurisdiction
of the federal courts over suits in equity and actions at law
is exclusive of the jurisdiction of the state courts*

In other

34
words, if our negligence case, in state law, is to depend

•

it would have to depend in large part — on violations of specific
duties set forth in subparagraphs (g) through (i) of Rule 17(a)
(5), as it existed in 1973* the accountants say we could not
rely on that as a breach of duty under state law, and we would
be left without a remedy.
QUESTION:

I thought — Wouldn't the effect of those

provisions be that if you win this case you no longer have a
state cause of action, because this would be your exclusive
remedy?
MR. KQBAK:

They said in the papers filed, both in our

state court action and with the District Court when they made
their motion to dismiss, that we had a cause of action based on
negligence, per se, in the accountants breach and failure to
follow the provisions of Rule 17(a)(5).
Touche Ross said in its papers, in both courts, that
that did not state a cause of action, under Rule 17, because
if there was any jurisdiction to enforce those provisions it
was the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.
QUESTION:

I take it, you don't finally accept your

opponent's word in the lawsuit as to whether a cause of action
exists, do you?
MR. KQBAK:

No, I don’t necessarily. Your Honor, but

I think that is an issue that may exist in state court actions.
In this case, there is no reason x?hy this should even be an issue.

35
I think it is clear from the Borak case»

I think it is clear

from Justice Harlan's concurrence in the Bivens case, when he
discusses the Borak case in a footnote, that one of the reasons
Section 27 exists is to insure that there be remedies for the
beneficiaries of Exchange Act provisions, and that those reme­
dies be uniform across the United States„
Now, state court law on accountants' liability has
developed in ways that are divergent, It has developed in ways
that are tied to developments in professional malpractice actions,
generally, but those developments have nothing in particular to
do with the federal policy of regulating broker-dealers for the
benefit of their customers.
Mr„ Roth says that he is relying, primarily, on three
cases, the Aratrak case, the Barber case and the Blue Chip Stamps
case,.

In Amtrak and Barber, there v/as no equivalent of Section

27 of the Exchange Act.

In addition, if a cause of action had

been recognised on behalf of the private plaintiff in either of
those cases, it would not only have been inconsistent with the
congressional goals in legislating on behalf of a particular
class of people, it would have been antagonistic to those goals.
For instance, in Amtrak, you could have had a person
In one part of the country saying, "Don't cut off my railroad,"
and filing a suit.

That might have been in his interest, but it

would have been antagonistic to the interests of other railroad
passengers, or would be railroad passengers, in other portions

36
of the United States.
Similarlya in the Barber case* where this Court
recognized that a private citizen* a customer of a brokerage
house* even though the beneficiary of the 8IPA Act* should not
have standing to invoke the remedies of SIPA* there was a clear
antagonism among the interests of the class.

One customer might

have wanted his brokerage house liquidated immediately.

Another

would prefer that the SEC* or the stock exchange undertake the
efforts that this Court pointed out those authorities commonly
undertake to see if that brokerage house could not be saved and
spare any possible loss to the customers.
Similarly* in the Piper case* where the necessity
language was underscored three times on page 25, The question
there was a different question.

The question was not whether

any private right of action was consistent with congressional
goals.

The question was whether it was necessary that the

particular plaintiff involved there be given a right of action
in order to effectuate those goals.

In that case* the plaintiff

was not a member of the protected class* and again there was a
possible antagonism between his interests and the interests of
the class* as a whole.

That was pointed out by Chief Justice

Burger on behalf of the Court at page 39 of the opinion.
The principles that are applicable here are those of
the Borak case* they are those of Bivens v. Six Unknown Narcotics
Agents.

They are also the principles that have been applied in

37
a well-established line of cases In the lower courts, under
Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act,
private right of action, expressly.

Section 6 creates no

17 ^ was designed by Congress for the protection of investors,

In our case, ws would have to prove duty

on behalf of Touche Ross, a breach of that duty, and causation,
the elements of any lawsuit,
QUESTION:
MR0 KQBAK:

Causation would amount to what?
Well, in our view, our prima facie showing

of causation would require us to show that Touche Ross, through
its negligence or gross negligence or recklessness, failed to
detect fraud, which,had it discovered in a timely fashion, it
would have had to alert regulatory authorities to the existence
of.

At that point, the regulatory authorities could have taken

action to prevent or reduce the-amount of damage that has been
suffered in the Weis liquidation,

those ignorant buyers are unable to sustain their causes of
action because they are unable to prove reliance and fraud.
QUESTION:

I am just asking you* why shouldn’t

customers have to prove something?

Because Congress wanted the customer to be

able to rely on the regulatory authorities to do that for him*

financial statements.
