proceed whenever you®re ready, Miss Offner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS JOAN OFFNER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONED
MISS OFFNER*

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Courts
This case involves a challenge to an employment
polLey of the New York City Transit Authority which excludes
from employment heroin addicts participating in methadone
maintenance programs.
The district court found this policy to be an
unconstitutional denial of equal protection of the law to
methadone patients, and found further that the policy had a
disparate impact on blacks and Hispanics,, in violation of
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1972
to apply to government agencies.
The Second Circuit affirmed the finding of
unconstitutionality and declined to rule on the Title VII
question, finding it unnecessary to do so.

4
Both the constitutional, question and the Title VII
question are before the Court, todaya
I propose to address myself first to the equal
protection issue0
QUESTION s

Wellg it’s conceivable, is it not, that

if we were to decide that the Court of Appeals had been
incorrect on the constitutional issue, we would not decide
the Title VII issue ©urselvet, but send that back?
MISS OFFNER:

Sand the Title VII question back?

QUESTION x

Yes 0

QUESTION:

Under the new statute3

MISS OFFNERs
QUESTION:

To the Circuit Court?
Yes 0

MISS OFFNERs

That could be done» That could be

done, Your Honor0
QUESTION:

But didn’t the Circuit Court say

there

was a violation of Title VII?
MISS OFFNER:

No, the Circuit Court did not» What

happened in this case, Mre Justice White, is that «—
QUESTION:

Well, they did for the purposes of

attorney’s fees, didn’t they?
MISS OFFNER:

The district court found a Title VII

violation for the purpose of awarding attorney’s fees0
QUESTION:
MISS OFFNER:

Yes0
At that time the Civil Rights

5
Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976 had not yet been enacted»
QUESTION*

Oh* yes»

MISS QFFNBR:

During tha pendancy of the appeal it

was enacted and therefor® the Circuit Court found it
unnecessary to consider tha Title VII question»
QUESTIONx Well, did the — did either court or
anybody suggest why the' constitutional issue was reached
without deciding the statutory issue?
MISS GFFNERg

No, as a matter of fact I think it

went just tha other way in the district» The district court
found the equal protection violation and said it was
therefore unnecessary to deal with the Title VII question»
QUESTION:

Well, do you see anything odd about that?

MISS OFFNERs
certainly cio»

Do I see anything odd about it?

I

But that is the way the original district court

decision went»
«

QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals apparently

didn't find anything wrong with that, either?
MISS QFFNERs

Apparently they did not» . That is

expressly stated in the district court's decision»

They

said, toward the end of their decision, that having found
an equal protection violation, there was no need to deal with
the Title VII question»
The group that we are dealing with in this case,
in terns of the equal protection issue, consists of heroin

s
addicts who are participating in methadone maintenance program»®
It is the contention of the respondents that this group is
entitled to equal consideration for jobs to the same extent
as the non-’addict job applicent®
QUESTIONS
MISS QFFNERs

For all jobs?
For all jobs®

Well* let me qualify that®

To the extent that the

district court established narrower boundaries for considera™
felon of these people for jobs* there is that limitation®

The

district court said that in certain* what they regarded as
safety-sensitive positions* it would not ba necessary®
QUESTION?

Yes* the district court opinion would

not let a drug addict run one of these subway cars®
MISS OFFNERs

Well* the district court specified

motonnan* conductor* bus operator* and positions dealing with
power equipment®
1 suggest* however* Mr® Chief Justice* that the
district court exceeded its boundaries in reaching that
decision®

In the first place* the district court had to make

a finding of unconstitutionality in order to reach the point
of .addressing itself to what ought to be a rational policy
for the Transit Authority®
The Transit Authority's contention is that its
policy has a rational relationship to a legitimate need*
and that the Constitution does not imposes on employers an

7
obligation to participata in what: amounts to a sociological
experiment.
The Transit Authority's refusal to employ methadone
patients is based on a variety of considerations, all of which
are supported by the record in this case.
place, the Authority is involved in

In the first

very difficult and

demanding job of providing subway and bus transportation to
the people of the City of Maw York on a vast scale, trans­
porting something like two billion passengers over the course
of a year»
It is our considered view that the responsibilities
involved in that operation require us to employ people in all
job categories who meet at least reasonable standards of the
liaoility rad stability.

And those considerations, taken

together with the uncertainties and the failures of methadone
treatment rad the difficulties of determining the employability of methadone patients , form the basis and the under­
pinning for the Authority's policy,
tod I think it's appropriate to note in this
connection that this Court, in Marshall v. United States,
expressed the very same concerns about the state of drug
rehabilitation programs, the validity, the uncertainty? and,
interestingly enough, Marsha 1 1 v, United States was decided
in the very same year as the trial that was conducted in this
case, 1974

8

The record in this case contains the testimony of
a number of medical experts,, most of whom were proponents of
methadone maintenance0

At the same time that they were

extolling the virtues of methadone maintenance as a treatment
for heroin addiction,,

They nevertheless were constrained to

admit that there was, and is, substantial drug and alcohol
abuse among methadone patients0

They testified to the

disruptive behavior of methadone patients at the clinics

9

to

the black market that exists in methadone with patients

e

selling their take-home doses on the street

and* most

importantlyf the issue in this case,, they testified to the
fact that methadone as a treatment for heroin addiction works
sometimes.
Indeed

t

one of the respondents —

QUESTION s

Works sometimes what?

MISS OFFNERs

Sometimes

,

It works for some heroin addicts.
QUESTION s

for some heroin addicts«
It stabilizes some of them,

Miss Offner, before you get too deep into

your argument, I'd like to ask you a question about the
precise class we're talking about,
MISS OFFNERs
QUESTION?

Yes,

As I understand the Transit Authority's

rul€i(, it's Rule 11(b) that is challenged —
MISS OFFNERs
QUESTION?

Yes.

— as being an improper classification,

9

and that talks about people who are using drugs in one form or
another, and the challenge is that you treat methadone as a
drug»
MISS OFFNERs
QUESTION?

Correct,,

And you say that's right®

Now, what is

the state of the record with respect to persons who formerly
used methadone but do not now take any drugs at all, say,
someone who had gone on rehabilitation program and claimed
h® was cured?

Is the record clear on what the Transit

Authority8s policy is there?
MISS OFFNER:

There was very little attention paid

during the course of the trial to people who detoxified from
methadone®

In other words, people who were totally drug-

free®
The Transit Authority's Executive Officer for Labor
Relations testified that the Transit Authority indeed will
categorically exclude from employment current methadone users
QUESTION?

Right®

MISS QFFNERs
methadone users®

—» and people who are relatively recent,

But that the Authority would give individual

consideration to people who have been totally drug-free for a
period of at least five years, and can demonstrate that, they
are maintaining a stable existence in terns of jobs, in terms
of family life, in terras of their social obligations®
The district court's opinion in two places that I

10

can recall indicated that they were sure that the Transit
Authority’s policy extends as far back as relatively recent
methadone users, but that it was not clear as to what the
policy was with regard to people who were totally drug-free
for a substantial period of time®
Now, it is our contention that the record is clear,
because we have the testimony, uncontroverted testimony of
our Executive Officer with regard to that policy»
QUESTION*

So your view would be that there is no

absolute exclusion of those persons who have been free for
four or five years?
MISS OFFNERs
QUESTION*

Correct,

And certainly the language of 11(b)

itself would be consistent with your information, your
position?
MISS OFFNERs
QUESTIONs

That is correct, Mr» Justice Stevens»

Three of the; four members of the class

were presently participating in methadone, were they not?
MISS OFFNER:

Yes»

That is right»

In terms of the usefulness of methadone as a
treatment for heroin

addiction for the class as a whole,

I think it9s very interesting to note the testimony of one of
respondents' own medical experts, who testified that out of
the 600 patients in his clinic only 10 had achieved a
sufficient level of stability at the end of two years in

11
treatment to qualify for reduction of their mandatory clinic
visits, down to twice a weak„
QUESTION s

In how many years?

MISS OFFNERs

Two years in treatment0

There was also conflicting testimony from the
various experts as to the relative merits of high-dose methadone
programs as opposed to low-dose methadone programs^ and with
regard to methadone programs as such compared with detoxifica­
tion programs0
There has obviously not been any unanimity among
the medical experts as to what constitutes an effective tool
for dealing with heroin addiction»
QUESTIONS

Miss Offnerf if this were a diversity

eaS(3, when the issue had bean whether or not methadone
participants can be satisfactory employees{, and the district
court had heard the evidence it did and made the findings it
did? would you say that a successful argument could foe made
to a Court of Appeals that its findings tfere clearly
erroneous?
KISS OFFNERs

That is not ray contentione Justice

Rehnquisto
QUESTIONs
MISS OFFNERs
QUESTION;
MISS OFFNERs

You don’t have to go «—
Excuse me?
You don’t have to go that far yet? do you?
No. I don’t go that far» The essence

12

of my argument with regard to what the district court did here
is that the district court misunderstood the rational basis
test*
For the»• most part I am not challenging what the district
court founds They found no more than that "substantial numbers
of heroin addicts are helped to a stable condition by
methadone»*
The essence of my argument is that that is not
enough to establish a finding of unconstitutionality under a
proper application of the rational basis test»
The uncertainties of methadone treatment are
compounded by the difficulty of ascertaining the employability of individual methadone patients,

The experts were

generally in agreement that when a methadone patient applies

for a job he presents a special problem to the employer,,
and that the employer needs some assistance in evaluating this
individual» The question is where, that assistance is to come
from»
A number of the experts were frankly skeptical about
the validity and usefulness of information that the employer
might obtain from the personnel at the methadone clinic»
On the average there is one doctor for every .200 methadone
patients at a public methadone clinic»

So that,, by and large0

evaluation of the patient’s progress in treatment is coming
from nonprofessional counselor personnel of the methadone

13

clinic who, as the experts indicated, vary considerably in
their competence and in their reliability.
'This problem is further compounded by federal

,

confidentiality regulations which provide that even if there
is consent by the patient, the methadone clinic cannot dis»
close information, specific information„ about a patient5s
condition to an employer unless the employer makes a commit­
ment that he will net, or that it will not use the informa­
tion adversely to the patient8s interest,
It is almost a Catch-22 situation , where the employe
will not be given specific information about the patient un­
less the employer makes a commitment not to use the informa­
tion, The idea is that the employer is supposed to use informa
tion to make an effort to rehabilitate the patient, which is
all well and good*, but the employer

„

obligations

e

as we sea it, has other

and that is to keep the subway system running.

The classification in this case does not involve any
fundamental interest as that term has been defined by this
Courtp nor does it involve any suspect category as enumerated
by the Courts

race, national origin, alienage in some

instances as well,

Nor does it involve immutable character­

istics of birth, such as those inherent in sex classification
and classifications of illegitimacy.
The group characteristic in this case consists of
a self-inflicted heroin addiction and methadone maintenance,

14
and that being so* there ia no dispute among the parties that
the proper feast to be applied in this equal protection
analysis is the rational basis standard®
That standard, as clarified by this Court in recent
years, gives to the Transit Authority9s policy a presumption
of validity, does not require individualized consideration,
approves the use of broad classifications, as long as those
classifications are rationally related to legitimate
objectives®
Contrasted with that standard, of course, is the
strict scrutiny standard in which there is not a presumption
of legitimacy, in which broad classifications are not
acceptable, and in which the government classification must be
shorn to be based on a compelling need®
What happened in this case was that both the district
court and the circuit court thought they ware applying, or
intended to aptpiy, rational basis standards, but took their
instruction from cases that dealt: with the strict scrutiny
standard? specifically Suqarman v, Douqall and LaPleur v®
Cleveland School Board®
As a result, they misunderstood the rational basis
standard and, in effect, viewed the evidence in this case
through the wrong end of the telescope®

They focused their

attention on the minority of methadone patients who become
stabilized, and did not deal with the fact that the majority

15
of methadone patients do not become stabilized*,
Influenced by the strict

scrutiny standard, both

of the lower eourtB decided that the Transit Authority policy
was overly broad, and that the equal protection clause
required a more individualized approach»
We submit that under a proper rational basis analysis
the operative fact in this case is not that some methadone
patients may become employable, but that most of them do nofcQ
And added to that, of course, is the difficulty of determiningemploy ability in individual situations»
We submit, therefor©, that there is ample evidence
to support the policy of the Transit Authority and the absence
of the invidious discrimination necessary for a finding of
unconatitutionality under the equal protection clause»
I would like to turn now to the Title VIX question»
Several months after finding an equal protection
violation, the district court rendered a supplemental decision
in which it found that the policy of the Authority had a
disparate impact on blacks and Hispanics and therefore
violated Title VII of th© Civil Fdghts Act»
I submit to this Court that the district court
decision totally distorts the

concept of disparates impact,

as established in Griggs v, Duka Power, and as carried forward
in Albemarle v„ Moody and, most recently I think, in Dothard
v0 Rawlinson

16

QUESTION?

May I ask, Miss Qffner

I am correct,

am I not, in my understanding that the Court of Appeals didn't
reach the Title VII issue?
MISS OFFNERs

Did not reach the Title VII issue,

yes»
QUESTION?

And since it didn't do so, how or why

is that issue now before us?
MISS OFFNERs

It was on® of the questions that I

poscsd in the petition for cert, Mr« Justice Stewart, and
cert was granted on that issue»
QUESTION?

In other words, it was a question wholly

undecided by 'the Court of Appeals, whose judgment we are
now reviewing, isn't it?
MISS OFFNER?

That is quite true»

Nevertheless,

as I say, it was one of the two questions on which this Court
granted certiorari»
QUESTION?

All right»

QUESTION?

That would not be uncommon, perhaps,

with a view to keeping the mett®r before tha Court, or possible
remand for consideration by it if there were no other basis
of disposition?
MISS OFFNERs

I do not disagree with the Chief

Justice»
QUESTION? Miss Qffner, are you going to address the
argument of the affect of the Rehabilitation Act?

17
MISS OFFKERs

Yes»

I do intend to do that»

I would just like to say very briefly on the Title
VII question that, as I understand the disparate impact cases
which this Court has decided, each of those cases involved an
actual abscmce, significant absence of minorities from the
particular employeres work force,.

And that absence existing,

th© Court tben looked to the particular challenged employment
policy, to determine whether that policy was where the fault
lay»
In our case, no such absence exists,

In fact, the

Transit Authority's employment pattern includes 46 percent
blacks and Hispanice, against a profile in the relevant labor
pool of 20 parcent blacks and Hispanicsc

And so we have more

than double; the percentage of minorities in the Authority's
work force than are represented in the Metropolitan Area work
force»
The respondents have suggested that this Court should
dismiss this case on the basis of a newly enacted amendment to
the Rehabilitation Act»

This new amendment provides in

general terms for inclusion of rehabilitated drug addicts and
alcoholics as handicapped persons under the Rehabilitation Act,
The amendment does not expressly apply to methadone
patients, and it is our contention that any attempt to
include methadone patients within the category of protected
persons would be certain to result in litigation»

18

As a practical matter* what the respondents are
asking this Court to do is to interpret the scope of this new
statute* which has not yet begun to be implemented* and apply
it retroactively to the Transit Authority„

They are asking

the Court to sanction the enormous equitable and monetary
liability imposed on the Transit Authority in this case on
the basis of a statute which was not enacted until four
years after the trial of this action* and* as I say* which
has not yet even begun to be implemented,,
Finally* end perhaps most important* they are asking
this Court to interpret the scope of this new statute and
to establish a precedent in this case which will undoubtedly
have a compelling influence on the shape of any future
litigation under the Rehabilitation Act»
C>UESTIONs
MISS QFFNERs

There were judgments for back pay here?
There are judgments for back pay for

the members of the class„

There is a vary substantial

attorneySs fee award„ And there is very extensive equitable
relief demanded of us in terms of evaluating and hiring any™
body who was turned down in the past by reason of being a
methadone patient»
QUESTIONs

Miss Offner* I gather that you do not

concede* far from it* that the statute* even as

amended this

past October* requires you to hire these people?
MISS OFFNERs

That is exactly right* Mr» Justice

19

Stewart»

That is our position, yes»
hnd we do believe that this is not a proper case

for interpretation of that provision, and that the Court
should decline to interpret it until a proper case is pre­
sented on a full recordo
1 would like to reserve the balance of my time for
rebuttal»
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Vary well»

We’ll resume at tills point at one o8clock0

AFTERNOON SESSION
[IsOO p.m.]
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mrs. Greenberg, I think

you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS„ DEBORAH M0 GREENBERG, ESQ0 ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MRS o GREENBERGs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
I would first like to respond to a question asked of
counsel for petitioners about the propriety of the lower
courts having addressed the constitutional issue before the
Title VII issue.
It may be that the Title VII issue, that Title VII
would not provide full relief to all members of the class,
sow! of whom are white.

However, if this Court should hold

that the Transit Authority's policy does violate Title VII,
there's no decision of this Court which forecloses its
ordering equitable relief, including back pay and seniority
credit.
QUESTION?

But isn't it possible that the district

court thought that it might as well reach the equal protec­
tion. issue first, because the Title VII issue also had a
constitutional issue in it?
MRS. GREENBERG?
court decided that.

I don't know why the district

21
QUESTIONS

Yes®

MRS® GREENBERGS
QUESTIONS

But there was, wasn’t there?
Yes, sir®

And furthermore, the constitutional issue

in the Title VII question involved the constitutionality of
an Act of Congress0
MRSo GREENBERGs
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor0

But, in any event, that’s a possible®

MRSo GREENBERGs

I was just trying to recall whether

the Transit Authority raised the constitutional issue relating
to Title VII at the time that ~~
QUESTIONS

Well, it certainly had by the time the

district court ruled®
MRS® GREENBERGs
QUESTIONS

Yes, it had, at that tins®

Yes®

MRSo GREENBERGs

Counsel for petitioners has over­

drawn the scope of respondents’ argument, and of the decisions
of Idle courts below®

We are. not concerned with some abstract

question of vfhether there would ever be a rational basis for
discriminating against methadone patients®
The narrow constitutional issue before the Court is
whether the Transit Authority’s unwritten rules of flatly
excluding successful methadone patients, the overwhelming
majority of whom are fully employable, from even consideration
for any of its 47,000 jobs, while giving individualized
consideration to every other applicant®

22
Whether this constitutes a denial of equal
protection —
QUESTION?

Mrs» Greenberg, you lay some stress on

the fact that the rule is unwritten*

Do you feel that helps

you or hinders you or is a neutral fact?
MRSo GREENBERGs

I think it helps us in the sense

that it goes to the degree of deference which this Court
should afford to the Transit Authority9a rule*
QUESTION?

Haven8t we said that a municipal

corporation's rule, when it's challenged constitutionally, is
just as if the New York Legislature had enacted a statute
to that effect?
MRSo GREENBERG?

That may be so, but even when

this Court is evaluating a legislative rule, as it did in
Murqia, it paid a great deal of attention to the legislative
*=“ the basis for the Legislature's action*
QUESTION?

And that would be true whether it’s

written or unwritten?
MRS* GREENBERG?
QUESTION?

Yes, Your Honor*

Mrs* Greenberg, isn't it correct that

tile issue isn't classification of methadone users, but, rather,
the question is whether Rule 11(b), as interpreted to include
methadone users, is too broad, that it's irrational because
it’s too broad?
MRS * GREENBERGS

Rule 11(b)

is directed only to

23
practices by incumbents, that is, parsons already employed
by the Transit Authority ? it is not directed to applicants
for Transit Authority employment0

So it is not merely Rule

11(b) that we are concerned with, it is the Transit Authority's
over-all rule of not considering for employment anyone and,
as well as terminating from employment, anyone whom it discovers
to be in methadone treatment, to aver have bean in methadone
treatment —
QUESTION?

Well, isn't it more precise to say

anyone who falls within the terms — who would fall within
the terras of 11(b) if an employee? And then they construe
11(b) to include methadone usersc
MRSo GREENBERG!

Yes, that's certainly part of our

argument, that it is irrational to do so, particularly in
view of the consideration that is given to all other
employees and applicants, sons of whom may violate rules„
For example, the —
QUESTION?

Well, tut you wouldn’t consider 11(b)

irrational if it did not, if they did not define methadone
users as persons who used drugs within the meaning of the
rule?

Or would you?
MRSo GREENBERG?

senting methadone users,,

Well, wa are, of course, repre­
If you are asking whether it would

be *— we could consider it irrational for the Transit Authority
to have a rule against the present use of narcotics by its

24

employees, our answer would be that it certainly would be an
irrational rule for the Tram it Authority»
But 1 might point cut that -QUESTION it

Well —> and they do have such a rule?

MRSo GREENBERGS
QUESTION?

Pardon?

They do have such a rule, which is quoted

on page 5 of petitioner's brief»
QUESTION*
QUESTION*

Page 5?
Yes»

That's what we're talking about»

You don’t contend that that rule would be irrational
if the definition did not encompass methadone users, as I
understand it»
MRSe GREENBERG*

If it did not encompass present

methadone users and only encompass present narcotic users who
did not have the permission of the Medical Director, we would
not consider it irrational»
The rule is not an absolute «—■* as written, is not
an absolute rule»

It is a rile that no one may use certain

kinds of drugs without permission, written permission of the
Medical Director»
The Transit Authority does not exclude from employ*’

ment or terminate from employment persons who use other drugs
that are encompassed within that rule, for example,
amphetamines or tranquilizers»

In that case it makes an

investigation to see whether there's some reason why the person

25
should be using those drugs»
QUESTION!

But just like Mr®' Justice Rehnquist

asked about a statute, can’t we look at -the rule as though
it were somewhat like a statute and we’d have to determine its
meaning by the way it’s been construed? and it has been
construed in some of these fringe areas to require individual­
ised treatment and in other areas it includes methadone users0
It seems to m@ the basic classification you’re
challenging is this classification made by the rule as
interpreted by the Transit Authority»

And you’re saying it’s

too broad a rufe»
MRSo GREENBERGs

Yes, it is too broad a rule»

We

are challenging it because tie Transit Authority — it is only
in the case of persons who use narcotice that the Transit
Authority does not give individualised consideration»
Not at issue hare is the Transit Authority’s right
to exclude methadone patients from any position which impinges
on the safe operation of the Transit Authority»

The district

court did not designate which jobs the Transit Authority
could consider safety sensitive, it gave some examples of
jobs, such as mo to man, conductor»
QUESTION!

How does that become the business of the

court?
MRS» GREENBERGs

No, it does not become the business

of the court, the court left it to the discretion of the

26

Transit Authority to determine which cf its jobs were safety
sensitiveo
QUESTIONS

But then it went on to say — it's going

to review that determination, is it not?
MRSo GREENBERGs

I should think that if the Transit

Authority abused its discretion and designated a job that
was obviously not safety sensitive, such as a file clerk job*
QUESTIONS

How about an accountant who handled a

lot of money?
MRS* GREENBERGs
QUESTION*

Well, —

Revenue people3

small bits and pieces»

Their money comes in in

It's not been unknown that heavy

embezzlements, in the aggregate, have been arranged by people
at that level*

Would that say that's a sensitive position,

or is it rational to say that there's a risk that the metha­

The record shows that after an

initial period of adjustment, which can last from a few weeks
up to, at most* a year, that after that period has passed,
the vast majority of methadone patients are employable„
Arid that that proof, the group that has .been in treatment
for a year or more, is directly comparable to any group of
applicants for positions in the Transit Authority»
QUESTION:

But if that's so, why did the district

court put aside the sensitive positions?

The district court, acting out of

an abundance of caution, wanting to adopt the least intrusive
rule that it could, allowed the Transit Authority to work

Did you object?

on what you just 3&id a momer t ago ? that you would think that

That figure is, I would say, an

The context from which that was drawn was the
one of the class members was trying to get a job

30

with the Transit Authority0

His treatment director wrote an

affidavit, signed an affidavit, in which, trying to show what
an exceptional and what an eminently employable person this
Mr® Wright was, said, “He's so good he's been allowed to take
home his dosage, so he will only have to come in two or
three times a week? and X run a very tight ship, most of the
patients in my program have to report every dayc*
The great weight of the expert opinion was that
after one year, at least two-thirds — and the testimony was
roughly from two-thirds to 80 or 85 percent of patients in
treatment are fully employable®
QUESTION:

When you say "the great weight of expert

opinion1*, you do admit, I take it, that there was conflict
in the district court, that differing views ware presented,
and he chose to believe the one that he thought was more
persuasive?
MRSo GREENBERG:

Not really® There was a difference

in the numbers that were talked about®

One parson said two-

thirds are employable, another person said 80 percent are
employable®

One difference is that there are different kinds

of programs®
For example, Irving Lukoff testified about employability at one program called Addiction Research and Treatment
Corporation, at which, by his testimony, employees —» pardon
me, has as its patients the hardest core addicts, people who

31
have been incarcerated for an average of seven years, with
long criminal records, very long addiction histories»

In

that program, after on® year, two-thirds are employable»
In some of the other programs which have a different
population, 80 or 85 percent are employablec
That's the only difference»
QUESTION? Well, what if, instead of all this
testimony being presented to the district court first, it
had been presented to the New York Transit Authority, and
after hearing exactly the same testimony the Transit Authority
had adopted the rule it did? do you think you could then have
gone into the district court on that record and said -that
this is aii irrational conclusion?
MRS o GREENBERGt

I think wa could have gone in on

that record — indeed, a lot of this, the few persons the
Transit Authority ever had contact with who were methadone
treatment experts, all told the Transit Authority that
methadone patients were empIcyable»
I think w® could heve gone «— that given the facts
that through this normal ordinary personnel screening
procedures of the Transit Authority, it could readily identify
those methadone patients who were employable»

And that

conclusion is baaed on solid,unchallenged, uncontraverted
findings of fact by the district court»

We would have gone

in and challenged the Transit Authority£s policy as

32

irrational,,
QUESTIONS

On the use of the tern *employable”,

did anyone define or did they agree on a definition of
employability?

But the fact was tha Transit Authority fired this

One other thing that is not at issue here*, the
Transit Authority’s right ~ first of all, its right to refuse
to hire any methadone patient who has not completed a year
of successful treatment»

It can also refuse to hire anyone

who does not meet its normal objective employment standards„
If the Transit Authority requires so many years of relevant
employment experience, it can. require that of the class0
The persons whom the Transit Authority refuses to considar for even the most ordinary, menial jobs are socially

I would like to address myself to what the judge
found about the ability of the employer, of the Transit
Authority to screen out, or screen in employable methadone

patients»
First of all, it is undisputed that there is no
class of persons other than methadone patients and others
with a history of narcotic addiction to whom the Transit
Authority denied individualized consideration for employment»
The Transit Authority has no blanket prohibition against the
hiring of persons with potentially disabling physical
conditions, such as diabetes or epilepsy or cardiac disease?
it has no blanket prohibition against the hiring of persons
with histories of alcoholism? it has no blanket prohibition
against the hiring of persons with criminal records or persons
taking transqullisers or amphetamines, or of persons who have
been confined to mental hospitals»
QUESTIONi

How does this advance your argument?

they have is rational or not»

©aspiring — vfith your Title VII case, does the record tell
us the relative number of black and Hispanic persons actually

MRSo GREENBERG:

The record tells us that 46 percent

of the employees of the Transit Authority are black or
Hispanic»

However, the record does not tell us what

proportion of applicants for Transit Authority positions are
black or Hispanic; so that the 46 percent figure is irrelevant»

39

QUESTION?

Well, how is —

MBSo GRSENBERGs

It may be that 60 or 70 percent

of the applicants in New York City to these jobs are black

QUESTION? Would you contend it was unlawful even
if every person rejected for this reason was replaced by a
person of the same race?
MRS» GREENBERG?

Yes, Your Honor»

Because the

individuals who are rejected are entitled to be considered
on their merits and not on the basis of a criterion which
has the effect of excluding disproportionately large numbers
of blacks and Hispanics and does not meet the business
necessity test

I

41

the impact is discriminatory on Negroes and Hispanics.
MRS. GREENBERGS

Yes.

What I'm saying

is that the

Transit Authority's claim that they are immunized, that their
methadone policy can't b® a violation of Title VII because
46 percent of their employees are black or Hispanic, that
claim doesn't make sense because, first of all, we don't know
what percentage of all applicants to the Transit Authority are
black or Hispanic.

It may be that as many as 60 to 70 percent

are.
QUESTIONz

Well, my question just went to relevancy
N.

here.

You can't really say that it's irrelevant in making

these evaluations? do you?
MRS. GREENBERGS

I'm saying that it's irrelevant

in the absence of any data about what even a -«■ if all of
their policies did not result in a ■— it's relevant because
we don't know what the racial, composition of their applicants
were.

If 80 percent of fchsir applicants were black or Hispanic:,

the fact that 46 percent of their employees were black or
Hispanic would just mean tM: their selection policy as a whole
was discriminating against blacks and Hispanics.
QUESTIONS

Well,

wouldn't you say that if 100

percent of their applicants were black or Hispanic, and 100
percent

of employees were black or Hispanic, it still

violates Title VII?

Because the ratio of methadone users

took the population in general.
