Mr. Gladden, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. GLADDEN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, GLADDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue presented in this case is whether, under
Section 14(b) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
when a state which has a law which prohibits age discrimination
in employment and has established an agency empowered to grant
relief from such practices, must a claim of age discrimination
first be filed with that state agency before the claimant mayinitiate an action in federal court.
The facts of this case may be stated very briefly.
Respondent Joseph Evans retired in January 1976 from his
position as hog buyer for Oscar Mayer in Iowa.

In March 1976,

Mr. Evans filed a notice of intent to sue with the United
States Department of Labor, claiming that he had been forced
to retire in violation of the Age Discrimination Act.
At the time of Mr, Evans' alleged forced retirement,
the Iowa Civil Rights Act prohibited age discrimination in
employment and established the Iowa Civil Rights Commission
to investigate and attempt to conciliate all charges of age

4
discrimination.

In addition, the Iowa Civil Rights Commission

was empowered,if it was unable to settle a charge through con­
ciliation, to hold hearings and if it found that a discrimina­
tory practice had been engaged in, to order cease and desist
and award back pay.
Mr* Evans ignored the available avenue of state
relief.

He did not file a claim at any time with the Iowa

Civil Rights Commission.

.Rather, one year after he had filed

his notice of intent to sue with the United States Department
of Labor, he instituted an action in the Federal District Court
in Iowa,

The Defendants in that action and Petitioners here

are the company Oscar Mayer and four of its management employees
who were involved in the decision with respect to his' retire­
ment ,
Oscar Mayer and the other Defendants in the trial
court below moved to dismiss the action for the reason that
Mr. Evans had failed to file a claim with the Iowa Civil Rights
Commission as Oscar Mayer contended was required by Section
14(b) of the Age Discrimination Act.
Section 14(b) requires —• and it is found at page
2 of our brief — and I quote:

"In the case of an alleged

unlawful practice occurring in a state which has a law pro­
hibiting discwnination in employment because of age, in
establishing or authorising a state authority to grant or
scck relief from such discriminatory practice, no suit may be

5
brought under Section 626 of this Title before the expiration
of 60 clays after proceedings have been commenced under the
state law, unless such proceedings have been earlier terminated.
In the trial court in response to the motion to dis­
miss, Respondent conceded that Iowa has an age disemination
law and that it has established an agency, and is, therefore,
within the terms of Section 14(b),

Respondent also conceded

that he had at no time filed a charge with the Iowa Civil
Rights Commission,

The trial judge, however, denied the

motion to dismiss, holding that filing of a charge with the
state agency was not required by Section 14(b) as a prerequi­
site to instituting action in the Federal District Court.
Rather, he concluded that Section 14(b) gave an age
claimant the option of determining whether or not to avail
himself of an available state remedy.

The trial judge certi­

fied his order and an appeal was taken to the Eighth Circuit
under Section 1292(b),
In its first decision, the Eighth. Circuit reversed
the trial court and held that Section 14(b) did require prior
resort to the state agency»

On rehearing, the Eight Circuit

changed its position and by a divided panel concluded that,
while the issue was not free from doubt,the preferable view
was that Section 14(b) gave an age claimant an option that he
was not required to file with a state agency.
QUESTION:

This v*as not by rehearing of the findings,

6
but because one of the judges changed his mind?
MR. GLADDEN:

One of the judges changed his mind

after the petition for rehearing had been filed.

It was not

an en banc hearing.
It is Petitioners’ position that Section 14(b)
establishes a prerequisite which must be complied with prior
to instituting action in Federal District Court.
It is our position that the language of the statute
is clear and,further that requiring resort to an available
state remedy is completely consistent with the purposes of
the age discrimination act.
As I just read the language to you, it specifically
saj^s "where a state has a law and an agency to enforce that
law, no suit may be brought under Section 626 of this title
before the expiration of 60 days after proceedings have been
commenced under the state law,"
QUESTION:

Mr. Gladden, it doesn't say that pro-

ceedings must be commenced under the state law though, does
it?
MR. GLADDEN:

It does not say they must be commenced,

but it say a no suit may be brought.

And I think if you will

look at Section 7(b) which deals with filing an action in
Federal Court, it rays, "No suit may be commenced until
notice is given to the Department of Labor,"

That particular

provision, using the same language, "no suit may be commenced,

15

7
has been uniformly accepted by the courts as requiring the
filing of a notice of intent to sue.
Equally as important, this language in Section 14(b)
Is titled precisely after language which appears in 706(c) of
Title VO, which is also quoted at page 2 of our brief and
reads almost Identically.

It says, and I quote : "In the case

of an alleged unlawful employment practice occurring in a state
which has a lav; prohibiting the unlawful employment practice
alleged and establishing or authorising state authority to
grant or seek relief from such practice, no charge may be
filed by the person grieved before the expiration of 60 days
after proceedings have been commenced under the state 'lav:."
/

Now, that particular provision has been uniformly
held to require a person to file a charge with a state agency
before he may initiate proceedings under Title VII.
Indeed, this Court in the decision in Love v,
t

Pullman Co. agreed with that position of the lower court.
And it is our position that, just like in Title VII, requiring
pr5.or resort to a state agency clearly serves the purposes of
the age discrimination —
QUESTION:

You are arguing that the similar language

had been construed and that we should follow that construction,
but I was suggesting to you that the language itself is not
entirely unambiguous.

Because, unlike Lection r(b) which says

that 'until the individual has given the Secretary notice,"

8
there Is nothing here that requires chat the proceedings be commenced before the state agency.
You. can read it either way, is all I am saying,
MR. GLADDEN;

I think you could technically read it

either way, but I think that when you look at the fact that
the language was taken from Title VII and consists of an inter­
pretation of Title VII, I think the far better reading,and I
think the reading which gives more meaning to the language of
the section, is one which reads it as a requirement.
It is our position that making it a requirement is

very consistent with the purposes underlying the Age Discrimin­
ation Act, because the Act encourages conciliation of disputes
rather than litigation of such disputes, and that by requiring
resort to state agencies you maximize the possibility of a non-

judicial resolution of such disputes.
I think it is important to recognize that in 1976
and in 1977 over 5,000 charges of age discrimination were
filed each year with the United States Department of Labor,
and as of the end of fiscal 1977 there was a backlog of over
2,000 cases before the Department of Labor with respect to
notices of intent to sue.
In 1977, 86 cases were filed by the Department of
Labor, but there were 433 Individual actions filed.

Since the

Department of Labor has enforcement responsibilities under 82
different laws, it is easy to see why the backlog is growing.

9
This led to statements of concern with respect to the tend ling
of age discrimination claims during the consideration of the
1978 Amendments.
It is our feeling that, given this problem, state
authorities clearly have a necessary, effective and viable
means of assisting in handling this growing number of age
discrimination complaints.
There are at least 30 states which have both a law
and have established authority to deal with age discrimination
complaints and, therefore, would be qualified for coverage
under Section 14(b).
Given the number of states which have acted in this
area, we think they have a clear role to play.
If the position of Respondent is accepted, and an
age claimant is given the option of whether or not to file
with the state agency, he is in a position to Ignore the state
agency, file a notice of intent to sue with an over-extended
Department of Labor and then proceed immediately Into Federal
Court.
The Solicitor General In his amicus brief concedes
that the state agency could help where there may have been a
mistake which led to the charge or where there may be simple
facts.
However, the Solicitor contends that since a
claimant could refuse to cooperate with the state agency and

10

then go off to Federal Court, that you should not require a
claimant to file a charge with a state agency*
It is our position that It is improper to determine
whether or not a person should be required to file a charge
with a state agency on the basis of whether or not he is willing
to cooperate with that agency*
QUESTION;

Is there anything in congressional history

that supports you that you have to go to the state first?
MR. GLADDEN:

I think, Mr. Justice Marshall, that if

you look at — the history which led to Title VII was very
clear.

They wanted —
QUESTION;

I am talking about this,

MR, GLADDEN:

When they adopted this provision, as

you recall — This statute, when It was first proposed at a
National Labor Relations Board type procedure, then through
various discussions it was amended and became a hybrid of
some of Title VII and some of —
QUESTION:

I assume your answer is going to be no.

MR. GLADDEN:

No.

Then, toward the end of the consideration, a repre­
sentative of organized labor and a representative of one of
the state agencies raised the question with Congress with
respect to the possibility that the Age Discrimination Act.-,
as then drafted, would preempt states and preclude them from
age discrimination enforcement.

And these two people suggested

11

to Congress that they follow the Title VII procedure.
Subsequent to that testimony* Section 14(b) was
added to the Act.
QUESTION:

That's all the legislative history —
But no Member of Congress said a word

about it?
MR. GLADDEN:

There is no recorded discussion on

that provision either way.
With respect to the question — I think this question
of cooperation or lack thereof could also be made with respect
to Title VII, yet no court has ever said that* even though a
person could defeat a state agency's acting under Title VII
by falling to cooperate* he should be excused from going to
a state agency.
Now, the Solicitor and .Respondent both rely on this
Courtrs opinion in Lori1lard v. Pons, dec ided last term, where
this Court held that there was a right to a jury trial for
age discrimination claimants.

And they particularly point to

the language in that case where this Court stated that Title
VII was not a reliable guide to interpreting the Age Discrimin­
ation Act.
However, the Court did recognize in that opinion
that the Age Discrimination Act was a hybrid, taking some
provisions from Title VII and taking some provisions from the
Fair Labor Standards Act, and that therefore they pointed out
— it's st page 582 of the opinion — this selectivity that

12

Congress exhibited In Incorporating provisions and in modifying
certain lair kabor Standards Act practices, strongly suggests
that but for those changes Congress expressly made, it Intended
to incorporate fully the remedies and procedures of the Fair
Labor Standards Act..
No», it is our feeling that Section 14(b) Is clearly
one of those exceptions.
Title VII.

The language Is taken directly from

There was no counterpart of that in the Fair Labor

Standards Act.
So, we feel then —QUESTION;

Can I interrupt here with a question

before the noon hour, so you can reflect on it over lunch?
You've cited this Love v, Pullman as holding that
under Title VII it is a Jurisdictional requisite that you go
to the state agency first.
I don't see that the case really held that.

Is

there anything In the opinion that even says that?
MR, GLADDEN:

I think the question there was

whether or not you had to file with the state agency, as I
understand it.
Solicitor

Basically, this has been conceded by the

and Respondent,

That has been attributed as being

the holding rf Love v. Pullman by lower courts and, as I say,
has been conceded in the briefs.
What they there held was that the deferral procedure
whereby, as I recall the opinion, you could defer a case —

13

If the charge was initially filed with the EEOC, then It could
be deferred to the state and then come back to the agency after
60 days, that satisfied the requirement of going to the state.
QUESTION:

It was a question of timeliness, I think.

Wasn’t it a question of ’whether it was filed in time?
MR, GLADDEN:

I think it was also a question of

whether you had to file with the state, as well.
As I say, the Respondent and Solicitor both
accept that proposition and the courts have uniformly accepted
— lower courts have uniformly cited the Love v. Pullman case
for the proposition that this Court agreed that prior resort
to a state agency was required.
With respect to the LoriHard opinion, I might go
on, this Court did also state In there that where Congress
adopts a new law, Incorporating sections of a prior law, that
normally Congress will be presumed to have knowledge of the
interpretation given to the incorporated law.
There are two differences between the Age Discrimina­
tion Act and Title VII to which Solicitor and the Respondent
point/ one being that you may file a concurrent charge with
both the Department of Labor and a state agency under the Age
Discrimination Act.
We do not feel that the fact that you can file a
concurrent charge means that the state agency should be
ignored.

This was obviously Congress’ effort to speed up the

14
administrative process.
We still feel that a state can play a meaningful role
in disposing even of a charge which is filed concurrently with
the charge filed with a federal agency.
Likewise, I think that the fact that if a federal
lawsuit is filed under the Age Discrimination Act
cedes the filing of a charge before a state agency.

it super­
I do not

think that that means a state agency should be ignored.
This provision merely avoids duplication once a
lawsuit has been Instituted.

But the fact that a state agency

cannot conclude a proceeding, does not mean it should not com­
mence the proceeding,because, If it is making meaningful prog­
ress, there is no requirement that the lawsuit be immediately
filed.

The requirement is that the state be given a minimum

of 60 days.

A petitioner does not have to file until at least

two years.

And if he alleges a willful violation, three years.
So that, if a state is making meaningful progress,

he does not have to go to court.
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1:00 o'clock, Counsel.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock noon, the Court
recessed to reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.m., the same day.)

15

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:01 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel, you may

proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. GLADDEN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS (Resumed)
MR, GLADDEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and my

it please the Court:
Mr, Justice Stevens, prior to lunch, you asked me
a question with respect to Love v. Pullman.
We reviewed that decision over lunch, and I think it
important to point out that the Court of Appeals there held
that the charge of discrimination had not been properly filed
with the EEOC in accordance with the requirements of the Actj
and this Court then specified that there were two such require­
ments, one being 706(b), which under the Amendments in 1972
became 706(c), and the other one being 706(d) which was
dealing with the time within which to be filed with EEOC.
This Court then reviewed the procedure that was
followed there and indicated that in the facts there had been
a referral to the state agency and the state agency had de­
clined to act.

And then this Court held that the procedure

complies with both the purpose — excuse me, complies with the
purpose both of 706(b), to give state agencies a prior oppor­
tunity to consider discrimination complaints, and of 706(d),

16

to insure expedition in the filing and handling of those com­
plaints.

This case has been assumed and presumed by all to

have held that you had to take a prior resort to a state
agency before you could file a charge under Title 7.
QUESTION:

The Love case simply held that there

had been compliance.
MR. GLftEDEN:

The Love case simply held that there

had been in the procedure that was followed there

—

I think it is important to point out that recogniz­
ing the close relationship and the similarities between the
Age Discrimination Act and Title VII, in February 1978,
President Carter proposed a reorganisation of civil rights
enforcement.

And this was submitted to Congress.

Congress

did not act, and therefore this reorganization will go into
effect.

Pursuant to this reorganization, the enforcement of

the Age Discrimination Act is transferred fco the EEOC as of
July 1, 1979.

This transfer was being undertaken to avoid

confusion and the overlap in enforcement.
The EEOC has, throughout Its history, worked closely
with state agencies in enforcing discrimination complaints and,
indeed, in the 1972 Amendments to Title VII if the EEOC is
acting on a commissioner's charge as opposed to an individual
charge, it still must refer that commis si oner's charge to a
state agency before it may undertake its investigation.
Iowa,and most other states, with age discrimination

17
statutes, have the same agency to enforce age discrimination,
race and sex discrimination.

And it is our feeling it simply

makes no sense to treat two identically worded statutory pro­
visions to be enforced by the same agency in two different
manners.

This simply will not reduce the confusion to which

the President was referring when he proposed his reorganisation.
QUESTION:

But there is some difference between the

procedures, isn’t there?
MR. GLADDEN:
correct.

There is some difference, absolutely

The procedures are more streamlined, there is no —
QUESTION:

And you don’t have to go to the state be­

fore you go to the federal, do you?
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

No, you may go —

Isn't that quite a substantial difference?

It certainly shows a good deal less deference to the state,
MR. GLADDEN;

It shows less deference, but it

doesn’t mean that you shouldn't go to the state at all,
because what it does is it sets up two parallel administra­
tive lines to be pursued,

If one starts taking meaningful

action with respect to that, then it may resolve an attempt to
to conciliate the matter to avoid the necessity of 'litigation.
I don’t think the fact that you can file concurrently means
that you can ignore one, which is what the Respondent's
position here is.
Respondent's position is the age claimant should

18
determine whether he wants to go to a state agency or not.
I don't think there is anything in the statutory pattern which
suggests that the option should be given to him to determine —
QUESTIONS

Must be filed with the federal people

before he goes to court.
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Once he files with the federal people,

how long does he have to v;ait?
MR, GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

He must wait a minimum of 60 days.

But even under your theory the claimant

can forget about the state proceedings at the expiration of
60 days, can he not?
MR. GLADDEN:

He can, after a minimum of 60 days,

but he doesn't have to go to court at the end of 60 days.
He can wait for two years.

So if the state has undertaken a

meaningful investigation as attempting to resolve the matter,
there is no requirement that at the end of 60 days he goes to
court.

It simply gives him that option after 60 days.
QUESTION:

That's all he is claiming here, I take

it.
MR. GLADDEN:

No.

What he is claiming here is he

doesn't have to go to the state at all, that he never filed
a claim and he never has to file a claim with the state, and
that any age claimant does not have to file a claim with the
state, he may ignore the state proceedings completely.

QUESTION:

He can’t ignore the federals but he can

ignore the state?
MR. GLADDEN:
QUESTION:

That’s his contention.

And your contention is that, of course,

he has to file with the federal, too, but he has to file with
the state, too.
MR. GLADDEN:

Correct, because in terms of the

numbers of complaints and the obvious purpose of the Act in
to have conciliation in these matters to avoid litigation.
QUESTION:

So, if he flies with the federal people

and waits 60 days, he still is going to have to file with the
state and wait 60?
MR. GLADDEN:
temporaneously.

But he could make that filing con­

And it is our feeling that this encourages

— Whet it does is that it establishes a state agency which
has an ongoing relationship dealing with plants with respect
to race and sex charges and other age charges.

It enables those

local people that have been dealing with plants to get Into
this picture and attempt to resolve these matters, so we don’t
get into federal litigation over an age discrimination complaint
if at all possible.
QUESTION:

Is there any explanation in the legisla­

tive history as to why there ivas no requirement of resorting
to state procedures before resorting to the federal procedures.
MR. GULDEN:

No.

There is no legislative history

20

in these terns with respect to the 196? Act.
As I say, the legislative history with respect to
Title VII was very specific that they wanted prior resort to
the state agency.

And the '67 Age Act, we feel, adopted that

language and, therefore, adopted basically the position which
was being expressed by the Senate vfith respect to Title VII.
I think it is important at this point to turn to the
fact that, although there was no change in Section 14(b) in the
1978 Amendments to the Age Discrimination Act,

the Solicitor

and Respondent both point to the Senate ^report which
was adopted by the Conference Committee
which concluded that Section 14(b) had not been intended to
require prior resort to the state, and that it had merely
been Intended to give the claimant an option.
It Is our feeling that observations ten years after
the passage of an Act clearly are not part of its legislative
history.

In addition, In '1978, as the Solicitor admits in his

brief, Congress amended the Act to alter judicial decisions
which in Congress’ view had been unfaithful to the Act, and
they made specific amendments, both substantive amendments
and procedural amendments.
First of all, they made a substantive amendment
with respect to retirement plans, overruling this Court's
opinion In the McMahon case.

Secondly, with respect to the

notice of intent to sue requirement • of the Secretary of Labor,

21

since there had been a good deal of litigation with respect
to what is a notice of intent to sue and what is not a notice
of -intent to sue,

they made a change making it simply that you

had to file a charge with the Department of Labor.

They also

made a change with respect to hoi? the statute of limitations
was to be treated* saying that the statute could be tolled
during the period of time when the Secretary was undertaking
conciliation.
At the time the '78 Amendments were being considered,
the only two Courts of Appeals which had addressed this ques­
tion of Section 14(b) had both held that prior resort to a
state agency was mandatory.
all in Section 14(b).

Yet, Congress made no change at

And the fact that they did not make the

change while they made other procedural changes, seams to me,
indicate.'- that no weight should be given to the Senate Report
which was part of the legislative history.
Respondent and the Solicitor both ask this Court
that even if this Court adopts the position that Section 14(b)
establishes a prerequisite to the filing of an action under
the Age Discrimination Act, that this Court should also adopt
a doctrine of equitable modification, whereby on a case by
case basis an individual age claimant should be able to
show why it should be excused from this requirement.
I think it is important to understand what this
position entails.

They are not asking for the tolling of the

22

Statute of Limitations to excuse a late filing*

What they are

asking is to be excused completely from the filing on a case
by case basis.

In effect, they are asking this Court to say

that courts can rewrite the statute and drop the requirement
out altogether, if the person can present sufficient factual
circumstances to justify that.
This will obviously create confusion as to under
which circumstances there would be a private right of action
and under which circumstances a private right of action is
preserved or not preserved»
And I think it is important to recognize that any
age claimant would then attempt to posit to the court a set
of circumstances which would justify his being excused if he
has not filed, which creates another issue, and we feel simply

encourages litigation.
Even in situations where courts have allowed tolling
of the Statute of Limitations, they have made every effort to
develop a very much objective standard of tolling so as to
avoid issues being raised as to whether or not this person
should be excused from the requirement.
We feel that, in short, Congress did not change
Section 14(b) at the time of its consideration of the 1978
Amendments, even though numerous plaintiffs had their cases
dismissed on this ground.
Because of the identity of the language between

23

Title VII and the Age Disdriminatlon Act. and the obvious
benefits from state participation in handling the ever-increas­
ing numbers of charges in this area, we feel that this clearly
indicates that the Court should reverse the Eighth Circuit
and remand this case to the District Court with instructions
to dismiss.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Gladden.

Mr. Ryan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. RYAN, JR., ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MR. RYAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

This is a hard case.

It is hard because the statu­

tory language is so ambiguous that it can support either alter­
native before the Court, and because the Petitioner has advanced
appealing arguments in his brief, the reversal of the result
reached below will alleviate congestion in the Federal Courts.
But these arguments are more seductive than they are persuasive.
First, let us keep matters in perspective.

There is

no question that a person with a complaint of age discrimina­
tion may vindicate his right in Federal Court.

He is required

to give the Secretary of Labor 60 days notice of his intent to
do so, which is now a charge as a result of the '78 Amendment.
And during that 60 days the Act requires the Secretary to

24

attempt to bring about conciliation through informal methods
of persuasion.
The question here, before this Court, is whether the
Act also erects an additional procedural obstacle that the
plaintiff must clear before he can go to Federal Court.
QUESTION:

Is it fair to say from your opening

remark that if the Eighth Circuit had gone the other way you
would not have brought the case here?
MR. RYAN:

I think by the time the Eighth Circuit

decided thi£ case there was a pretty pronounced conflict
among the circuits and I think that, by itself, would have
justified certiorari.
The question here is whether in addition to giving
the Secretary 60 days to settle the cas% the complainant must
also, in effect, give the state 60 days to do the same thing,
if the discrimination took place in a state that has an agency
set up to handle age discrimination claims.
Noxv, we are not talking here in this case about
exhaustion of state remedies.

Petitioner concedes that the

most the statute can require is that the claimant file his
charge with the state agency and then wait 60 days.

After that

60 days, the claimant has an unfettered right to go into
Federal court, regardless of what the state may or may not
have done to his complaint in the meantime.

That requirement,

if this Court holds that it is a requirement, is, xve think, a

procedural monkey-wrench in the administration of this Act that
will serve neither the states nor the plaintiffs nor the
Federal Courts,
QUESTION:

If the Court finds that the language of

the statute provides just that., however, the fact that it may
be a procedural monkeywrench is none of our business, Is it?
MR* RYAN:

If this Court finds that that is what

Congress intended, then we agree, Mr. Justice Stewart. But I
think this Court has the opportunity to construe an admittedly
ambiguous statute —
QUESTION:

\4ho admits it is ambiguous?

You claim it

is ambiguous and so does the Respondent, but the Petitioner
says that it is very clear.

So, it is not at all conceded that

this is an ambiguous statute*
MR. RYAN:

I am sorry.

I don’t mean to imply that

QUESTION:

You are relying on a presumption that

it was,

Congress does not create procedural monkeywrenches?
MR. RYAN:

I would like to rely on that presumption,

Mr. Justice Rehnquiafc.

Experience shows that that is not

always a safe presumption to rely on.
QUESTION:

Is it true that the complaining party

would only have to file a piece of paper with.the state?
MR. RYAN:

In this case?

QUESTION:

In any case

26

MR. RYAN:

I don't understand.

QUESTION:

In order to do what Petitioner says,

would it be satisfactory if the complainant merely files a
piece of paper with the Wisconsin agency, or Iowa, or whatever
it is, saying "I've been done inM?
MR. RYAN:

That Is a question that the Federal

Court will have to answer when the case ends up there.

In

fact, that is a question that has been much litigated, where
plaintiffs have gone to state agencies.

They go into the

Federal Court and the employer says, "Now wait a minute.
You’ve been to a state agency, but did you file In time,
did you file sufficiently, did you file on the proper form,
did you comply with all of the state procedural requirements
that the state act sets up?"
And then the District Court has to decide that

such thing, in our opinion.

It will do no

It will simply place a new round

of questions before the Federal Court in that time when the
plaintiff finally ends up there.
QUESTION:

Your friend has suggested that — and

1 suppose we can judicially notice the fact that most claims
of this kind are subject to settlement by conciliation nego­
tiation

27

Nowa starting from that premise, if that's true —
and we are trying to look at a statute that’s not very clear
— wouldn’t it make sense that Congress would prefer to dis­
perse this as, 2 think, he suggested, among the states, rather
than having it all concentrated in the Federal Courts?
MR* RYAN;

Well, I think they would much prefer to

have caaes like this settled rather than litigated.

I think

I

there is no question about it and it —
QUESTION;

It is the desirable — for a dozen

MR. RYAN;

Without any doubt at all.

reasons.
I am sure that

given that choice every Member of Congress would have said,
"We favor conciliation and settlement,"

What they did in

response to that concern, in our view, is they gave it to the
Secretary of Labor,

They said, "Thou shalt not file a suit-

in Federal Court until you have gone to the Secretary of
Labor and given him at least 60 days."

And then it said to

the Sectefcery of Labor, "You are obligated to make every at­
tempt within the 60 days to settle this claim."
QUESTION:

One way that the Secretary of Labor might

employ to settle it would be cooperation and coordination with
the state agencies, is it not?
MR. RYAN:

That is, in his discretion, one path that

he Bright choose.
QUESTION:

In other words, if the state has an agency

28

which has established a record in the mind

of the Secretary

of Labor as being effective, prompt — reasonably so — and
the Secretary of Labor xojould perhaps hold his hand and say
proceed«
MR, RYAN:

That is a choice that the Act leaves

open in the sense that it doesn't preclude it, but there are
two points, I think, Mr, Chief Justice, in that regard.
not every state has an agency of this sort.

One,

In fact, Petitioner

says thirty, and I see no reason to dispute that.

So that

leaves twenty states without an agency of any kind.
QUESTION:

If there is no agency, there is no

problem, is there?
MR. RYAN:

Well, there is a problem in the sense

that if a plaintiff goes directly into Federal Court the
employer is free to raise the question and say, "Is this a
state which requires resort to state procedures?"

And this

puts another question in front of the Federal Court that It
must answer.
QUESTION:

If there is no agency that should be a

question readily answered.
MR. RYAN:

It is not readily answered as easily as

it sounds, because there are cases in which Federal Courts
hove opened the state statute books and said, "There are some
statutes in here that prohibit discrimination in one way or
another." Does this fall within the type of statute that

■29

Congress had in mind?
QUJjSTION:

But the question is not does the state

law require resort to the state procedures'?

The question, as

I understand it, is if the state has a law prohibiting dis­
crimination in employment because of age, and establishing or
authorizing a state authority to grant or blah, blah.
It doesn't depend at all on whether the state does
or does not require.
MR. RYAN:

That is correct, Mr, Justice, it does

not depend on that, but when the plaintiff goes into Federal
Court not having gone to any state agency at all the employer
is certainly entitled to raise as one of the questions that
the Federal Court must decide:

"We are in a deferral state and

this man has not deferred."
So, what we are saying is to hold an employee must
go to the state agency, as a general rule of law, is not going
to alleviate any burden on the Federal Courts.

In fact, the

predictable effect is going to be bo further embroil the
Federal Courts in these matters.
That’s just one aspect of this case, but it is
important.
QUESTION:

I suppose once it were decided in any

district, that state does have a law or that state doesn’t
have a law, that \MOuld be the end of it for future cases,
wouldn't it?

30

MR. RYAN:

Assuming that the law doesn't change in

that state.
QUESTION:

Yes,

There wouldn't be repeated litiga­

tion about it.
j.

MR. RYAN:

I would think not.

QUESTION:

Would you help me with the problem 2 was

concerned with before lunch?
Dojpu agree that Section 706(c) of Title VII, which
I guess has identical language in it, does require a prior
filing with the state, in the Title VII case?
MR. RYAN:

I would answer that, Mr. Justice Stevens,

by saying that is the way it has always been understood.
QUESTION;

And the Government doesn't question that

understanding ?
MR. RYAN:

Certainly not in this case, and I don't

think that we do in —
QUESTION:

So, what really we are being asked to do

is to say that the identical language in two similar statutes
has different meaning?
MR. RYAN:

Well, that — % answer was that that is

the way it has always been understood.
Love v. Pullman did not pass on that question.

In

fact, I think, a proper reading of Love would indicate that
the plaintiff is required to go to the EEOC before he goes to
Federal court, something that's perfectly —

31
QUESTION:

I didn’t think hove really squarely de­

cided, but it seems to me this is something everybody is
assuming for purposes of the decision.

And so really what it

boils down to is you are asking us to construe precisely the
same language in similar statutes in different ways.

Yes,

Without pertinent legislative history?

MR. RYAN:

Well, the difference is that in Title VII

there is unmistakable legislative history that shows that

are not construing Title VII in this action.

We

We are con»

struing the ADEA, and there is no legislative history in the
ADEA which speaks specifically —
QUESTION:

What my brother Stevens says is that we

say that these two sections are not identical but are so
similar that we can't discern difference between the two.
However, we do find that one means something different fran
the other.
Now, I can write that much, if I was writing the
opinion, but when I got to citing seme, I'd be in a lot of
trouble,
MR. RYAN:

I would be happy to give you something

to cite.
The structure of the ADEA is different from the
structure of Title VII in terms of utilizing state remedies
and utilizing Federal remedies.

There are a number of dis­

tinctions that we point out in our brief, where Congress
clearly intended something different for ADEA,

And part of

the reason, as Senator Javits and others mentioned in a de­
bate, is that they were most unimpressed with the conduct of
many state agencies.

They felt that the state agencies — and

this is only two years after Title VII -- three years — after
Title VII had passed — that many of the state agencies simply
were not equipped to deal with these discrimination complaints.

33
Now, as a result of that, they made unmistakable
changes in ADEA.

For example, they did not require a right to

sue letter from the Federal agency.

The plaintiff can go into

Federal Court 60 days after he notifies the Secretary, without
any further ado.
They did not require, for example, that any state
remedy be resorted to first.

They showed, as my opponent

mentioned in his argument, the ADEA does show less deference
to the states than Title VII.

There is no question about it.

So, that is my answer to that question, that while
Congress may have used similar language, this Court is cer­
tainly free to look at the acts themselves and see that the
structure is different.
QUESTION:

The Act we have here was not intended to

give any deference to the states?
MR. RYAN:
no deference.

1 would not say it was intended to give

It was intended to give a — well, I am sorry.

If, by deference, you mean a mandatory referral to the state
procedures, then I agree.

It was not intended to do that.

It

was intended to give the states some opportunity if the plaintiff
chose to go there.
QUESTION:

But they would have that without this

section, wouldn’t they?
MR. RYAN:
to go?

That the plaintiffs would have been free

34
QUESTION;

Yes.
J

MR. RYAN:

They would have, but then they would have

gotten into some of the problems which this Court mentioned in
Love v, Pullman, which, of course, was yet to be decided in
1967.

For example, could he go to a state agency and then go

into a Federal Court, if the state agency found no probable
cause?

Or if the state agency, for that matter, found no

discrimination whatever, would he have a res judicata problem?
There were any number of questions that could
readily be imagined if this statute did not address the proper
relationship between state and federal agencies.

So, by

passing Section 14(b), v*hat they were saying is:

"You can go

to the states if you want to.

We don't want to shut off the

states altogether, but it is our position" — Congress is
speaking — "that after 60 days you are free to vindicate
whatever rights you have under this Act."
So, I think, in that sense, it was not clear, and
certainly not in 1967*
I think that what we are talking about here, this
Act — the AD£A has an unusual number of procedural difficulties.
And any look at the recorded decisions, I think, will bear that
out.

We are asking this Court to simplify this Act, not to

complicate it.

It can construe this ambiguity, as we say,

reasonably, either way.
QUESTION:

We simplify it no matter what we do, if

35
we decide 'ohe case.
MR. RYAN:

X respectfully disagree, sir.

I think that while if you reverse the judgment below
you will have answered a question, you will not have simplified
the administration of the Act because every act henceforth will
have to answer the number of questions that I raise.

Namely,

was the compliance with the state procedures, in,this case,
sufficient?

Is is just going to —

QUESTION:

As conditions change in the various

states, it is a simple matter for Congress to modify this
problem, if they think a problem flows —
MR. RYAN:
either way.

It is simple for Congree to modify it in

Certainly if Congress does not like what tnis

Court says it can change iu,

It did that in McMahon and it can

do that in this case if it wants to.
But our position is that, given that choice to
complicate the Act or to simplify is, that this Court should
simplify it.

And if Congress wants to change it, that's up

to Congress.

But until that time comes, the purpose of this

Act, to give individuals a right in Federal Court to vindicate
claims of age discrimination, should be supported by this Court
and not submitted to a continuing round of procedural questions,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK W. BENNETT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, BENNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The narrow issue before the Court today, involving
the proper statutory construction of Section 14(b) of the Age
Discrimination In Employment Act, has been considered by five
Courts of Appeals, four within the last year.
The court below, the Holliday opinion, which is en
banc unanimous from the Third Circuit, reversing their previous
in

and the Gabriele decision of the Sixth Circuit, held

that it is an optional prerequisite.
QUESTION:

The contrary views —

Is that the case where the, Court of

Appeals relied on the legislative history, largely?
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

The legislative history eleven years after

the event, is that the one?
MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

Ten years after, Your Honor,

Perhaps, different Members of Congress

who were not even Members of Congress when the Act was passed.
MR, BENNETT:

As the Secretary pointed out In the

brief, Mr.Chief Justice, six of the Members were.
QUESTION:

X said "could be," not "were."

Tney

could be an entirely new team.
MR. BENNETT:

Yes.

Some of them were, in fact, and

some were holdovers.
But the collective wisdom of the Holliday, Gabriele
and the court below established three major principles.

One

is that Section 14 of the ADEA is not the mere image of Title
VII.

There are some differences which I will get to, and 1

think those differences are important and affect the inter­
pretation to be given Section 14(b).
Secondly, -she legislative history of the ADEA is
not instructive.

It is, perhaps, silent on the proper inter­

pretation to be given Section 14(b).
And, finally, that absent congresslonally expressed
intent to the contrary, Section 14(b) should be construed to
assist the intended beneficiary of the Act.
Turning to the first proposition, that Section 14(b)
is not the mere

.mage of Section J06{. ) of Title VII,

Through­

out the litigation in this case, Petitioners would have us be­
lieve that the mere Incantation of the analogy to Section 706
(c) resolves the matter.
I tnink it takes additional analysis.

The language

33
is not identical.
Under Section 706(c) of Title VII, the appropriate
terminology is "no charge may be filed," with EEOC.

That gives

a state a mandatory 60 days deferral opportunity to deal with
the alleged discrimination.
All federal action is precluded and the filing of
suit is likewise precluded.
On the other hand, under Section 14(b) of the Age
Discrimination ir> Employment Act, no suit may be brought.
However, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist previously recognized, this
allows for a multitude of opportunities.
For example, there can be simultaneous jurisdiction,
where the state deferral agency and the Department of Labor go
at it simultaneously, or the state can go first or the Federal
Government can go first, or the Federal Government can go first
or the state car go first.

They haven’t clarified it in the

statute.
Now, the effect of the difference in the language is
this.

Under Title VII, the states have exclusive jurisdiction

for 60 days.

Under the ADEA, there is no exclusive jurisdiction.

There is either simultaneous or consecutive, in any order that
the claimant may go.

He may go to the state first, or he may

go to the federal first,
QUESTION:

You do agree that under Title VII, even if

the complaining party does not file anything with the state, he

39
still must wait 60 days before he can file a charge with the
EEOC?

Do you agree with that?
In other words, the oQ~day waiting period is not

contingent on an actual filing with the state, under Title VII?
MR. BENNETT:

I am not sure that situation would

arise because of this Court's decision in Love, which said -or at least it seemed to intimate — that you had to go to
the state agency first*
In ether words, I guess the ansiner to your question
is EEOC will not accept jurisdiction until the state has its
/ ■

60 days.

It is a mandatory exclusive jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Then, if that’s a fair reading of that

language as mandatory, why — except for the difference between
"no charge" and "no suit" — doesn’t grammatically the same
language lead to the same result in the other statute?
Do we have an English grammar problem here?
Once you’ve agreed that it reads that way in one
statute, why doesn't it read the same way in the other statute?
MR. BENNETT:

Because, in Title VII, I think they

specifically said that the state must be given the 60-day
period.

It's not the language of 706, but the language of

another section in Title VII.
Just like in the ADBA, it is not the language of
Section 14(b), but the language of another section.

In other

words, the jurisdictional prerequisites in the ADBA are set

40

forth In Section 7(d);, the notice with the Department of Labor.
QUESTION*.

What is the section in Title VII that re­

quires prior resort to the state agency?
MB. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

X cl on ‘ t know the answer to that.

But you say it is not this section?

I was under the impression, from all the argument,
that this is the source of the requirement they go to the state
first.

But then you are saying the same language doesn't im­

pose a similar requirement —
MR. BENNETT:

Section 706(c) has been interpreted to

me and I am erroneous,
QUESTION:

This section only applies to states like

Doesn't that lead some credence to the fact that

they do expect you to use tine state machinery?

Aren't they

really making a separate rule for states that have state
machinery, from states that don't have state machinery?
Isn't that what 14(b) is?
MR, BEI'INETT:

I think 14(b) says you have the option

41
of going to the state.
QUESTION;

Well, let me read.

It says:

of an alleged unlawful discrimination occurring in a state
which has a law,"
Well, what is the provision in a state that does not

MR, BENNETT:

Mr. Justice Marshall, there is no state exhaustion requirement.
QUESTION:

Right.

So, I mean, the whole point is,

that this could be once you get in a state that does have such
a law you have to go to the state machinery first,
MR. BENNETT:

That could be, but it's obviously not

the interpretation that we are urging.

QUESTION:

Yes, Sixth Circuit.

MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

In any event, Title VII —

The Sixth Circuit Judges were divided?

MR. BENNETT:

Yes.

One-one.

In any c ent, Title VII strongly emphasized the
administrative process.

The ADEA gives less deference to the

administrative process than does Title VII.

As an example of

that, under Title VII, the state agency would have 60 days
and then EEOC would have 120 days.

And at the time the ADEA

was passed the EEOC either had to make a finding of probable

43
cause or else mediate the action.

But under the ADEA for any

reason whatsoever, after the filing of the 60 days, the com­
plainant can cut off the state administrative agency.
Under Oscar Mayer's view of Section 14(b), they still
get a different result than under Title VII, because
Title VII

— excuse me.

under

They would still get a different

result because under Title VII you have to go to the state
first.

But there is no requirement}if you hold that Section

14(b) is mandatory, that we would have to go to the states first.
In other words, you may go second, or it may proceed
simultaneously.

And if you proceed simultaneously, there is

no exclusive jurisdiction in the state agencies.
It is hard to believe that Congress would have in­
tended every claimant to make a prior resort to the state,
even after going to the Secretary of Labor, where the case was
unable to be conciliated, and then go back to the state for
another attempt,when the first attempt was futile,before they
could file suit.
I don't think that's what this section entitles.
This section is really an anti-preemption section.

They

wanted to make sure, and show the states, that Section 14(b)
did not preempt the states' right to have laws that Interpret
this matter in the same way as the ABBA,
In fact, I think, the construction we are urging
would be an incentive for state civil rights agencies to have

44
stricter enforcement to encourage claimants to return to the
states.
QUESTION:

There have been anti-preemption provisions,

though, in civil rights acts that simply say "nothing in this
Act shall preempt state provisions that go further," without
saying — being as expressive about going into the state
procedure as this one does.
MR, BENNETT:

That certainly would have been a

clearer way to do it, but I think this section — We ivould
have known the answer had they done that.
QUESTION:

Yes,

We wouldn't all be here today.

We might, but you wouldn't,
MR, BENNETT:

It is interesting to note under the

legislative history that there is a total lack of legislative
history under the AD BA; where under Title VII the legislative
history is clear, by the remarks of Senator Humphrey, that it
was intended to go to the states.

In fact, I've cited in a

footnote in my brief that at least two courts and Senator
Javits felt that the courts would be the way to resolve
actions under the ADEA, rather than the administrative bureau­
cracy; hence, the streaml5.ning of the process,
I would like to comment briefly on the legislative
history cited by the Petitioners in this matter.

They cited

the testimony of Ed Conway of the New York Human Rights
Commission had supported their position.

But the last phrase

45
on page 23 of their brief is that he wanted to avoid to the
greatest extent possible the coming into being of unnecessary,
duplicitous effort.
I wouM suggest that the construction they urge
that would require simultaneous or consecutive filings with
both a state and federal agency would contribute to duplicitous
resources at the federal and at the state levels.
QUESTION:

Couldn't they solve it, as I have read

that some states have solved it? When the papers are filed with
the state agency, they notify the federal and vice versa, and
they work out a coordination that if one is going ahead the
other one stays its hand?

Isn't that administratively a

relatively easy problem to solve?
MR. BENNETT:

That would work in the case of con­

current filings, where the filings took place at the same time,
but if an individual chose to file with the Department of
Labor first, then the Department of Labor is under a mandate
to use those 60 days.

And then maybe on the 6lst day, if that

individual is within the statute of limitations on the state,
and would then file with the state, it would be too late for
that kind of oooperation that you suggest,
QUESTION:

Why would it be too late?

The Secretary

of Labor or no other agency in the Government works so
swiftly that it would have gone very far,that it couldn't work
coordination on the 6lst day.

46
MR. BENNETT:

But in any event, the claimant could

file suit in Federal Court on the 6lsfc day, because that's all
the time the statute gives,
QUESTION:

Under the statutory scheme, that can't be

avoided by coordination* I agree.
QUESTION:

Well, he need not go to the federal

administrative agency at all,
MR* BENNETT:
QUESTION:

Under this statute?

Under this statute.

MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

.

That is incorrect, Your Honor.

Can't he file suit?

MR. BENNETT:

No, there is a 60~day waiting period

with the Department of Labor, as well as a 60-day waiting
period with any state civil rights commission,
QUESTION:

But he doesn't have to get a right to sue

letter, or anything?
MR. BENNETT:

There is no right to sue letter.

He

controls the time at which he ivishes to file suit, rather
than the opposite in Title VII he has to have a right to sue
letter.

But you still have a 60-day waiting period with the

Department of Labor.
Before I touch on the final argument, just briefly,
*

I would like to address the question of noncompliance with
Section 14(b) and should it be subject to equitable considera­
tions .

47
The lower court decisions on this issue that held
that 14(b) was mandatory also allowed the principle of equitable
modification.
I suggest that this case, if the Court goes against
us on the 14(b) argument, is the kind of case where the
district court judges should be allowed to exercise their
discretion, because we relied on the statements of the Depart­
ment or: Labor that we did not have to comply with Section
14(b).
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Gladden?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. GLADDEN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GLADDEN:

May it please the Court, I would add

just briefly that the major changes administratively that
'were made were in response to the EEOC's handling of charges
under Title VII.

What they did away with was the notice of

right to sue, the fact that the agency had to make a finding
of reasonable cause.

Those are the things that were changed.

They also gave this enforcement to the Department of Labor
instead of EECC.

Those were the things that were changed.

With respect; to going to a state or not going to a
state, the language of 14(b) is identical.

I might also point

out that with respect to filing a charge with the Department

48
of Labor, Section 7(b) provides that if you-are in a state which
is covered by 14(b) you have 300 days to file your notice of
intent to sue, now charged with the Department of Labor,
If you are not in a state covered by 3.4(b), you only
have 180 days.

Clearly, that’s giving deference to the state,

encouraging the party to go to the state because it extends
his period of time within which he can come to the Federal
Government if the state doesn’t start moving along in a
meaningful *jay.

That 180-300 day pattern is exactly the same

pattern that is followed under Title VII,
So, with respect to the states and the effect of
filing a charge or a notice with the state, the pattern is
identical, in the Age Discrimination Act, to Title VII.

The

changes that were made had to do with what the EEOC had been
required to do under Title VII, as opposed to what the
Department of Labor was required to do, and that was an effort
to speed up the administrative process, primarily at the
federal level.
Thank you, very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted»
(whereupon, at 1:44 o'clock, p*m«, the case was
submitted.)
