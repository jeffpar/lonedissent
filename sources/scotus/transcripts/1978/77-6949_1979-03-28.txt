PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-69^9, Dunn v. United States0
Mr. Sears, I guess you may proceed whenever you are
ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL J. SEARS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SEARS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The petitioner is before the Court today to present
three primary questions, whether a sworn statement taken in a
private attorney’s office may be deemed a proceeding ancillary
to a U.S, court or grand jury violation of 18 U.S.C., section
3.623, can immunised testimony be used against a witness to
establish the corpus delicti in an inconsistent declarations
prosecution without proof that the witness testified falsely
under Immunity, and if the appellate court in this case can
adopt a proper theory in sustaining a conviction of Mr. Dunn.
Your Honors, petitioner submits that all three issues
must be resolved against him before the conviction can stand.
The underlying case proceeded as follows:

Mr. Dunn appeared

before a federal grand jury in Denver, Colorado, on June 16,
3.976.

He claimed his right to remain silent and subsequently

was ordered to appear before a United States District Judge
whereupon he was granted immunity under 18 U.S.C., section 6002.

He thereafter reappeared and testified to certain drug activi­
ties at the Colorado State Penitentiary., implicating one
Phillip Musgrave and several other eo-defendants.

As a result,

an indictment was returned against Musgrave and three of the
co-defendants.
On September 30, 1976, he appeared in the office of
Musgrave1s attorney, Michael Canges, and proceeded to recant
his grand jury testimony.

Present was a notary public who

administered the oath and recorded Mr. Dunn’s statement by
virtue of a tape recorder.

It was subsequently reduced to

writing and tendered to the U.3. District Court -—
QUESTION:

I take it he didn’t just wander into the

attorney’s office?
MR. SEARS:

Your Honor, although the record is silent

as to this, I believe the evidence would Indicate that Mr.
Dunn and Mr. Musgrave proceeded to strike a deal and he sub­
sequently wound up In his attorney’s office, Mr. Musgrave1a
attorney's office and recanted what he had told to the grand
jury.
The statement was reduced to writing and tendered to
the court as an exhibit in support of a motion to dismiss the
indictment against Musgrave.

On October 21, 1976, the hearing

on that motion was held in United States District Court, Dunn
was called as a witness and once again reaffirmed the affidavit,
even though he had Indicated he had not totally reviewed it.

5
The charges against Musgrave were subsequently re~
duced.
QUESTION:

Well, when he reaffirmed the affidavit.

Would you enlarge on it?

He was under oath before a grand

jury, was he?
MR. SEARS:

He was under oath before a U.S. District

judge, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR, SEARS:
QUESTION:

A district judge.
Yes.
And did he simply say we reaffirm it in

a conclusory way or did he restate the same facts?
MR. SEARS:

Your Honor, I believe the nature of the

testimony was that he was asked to identify the affidavit, did
identify It, asked him if It was the truth, he said yes, It
was, and he says is it all the truth, and he said possibly ten
percent, each declaration that he made before the grand jury
was not proceeded through and it was only the conclusory remark
that 90 percent of it was false which —
QUESTION:

When you say 90 percent false, that was

directed at what, at the original grand jury testimony or at
the affidavit?
MR. SEARS:

No, Your Honor, it v/as directed at the

original grand jury testimony.

Now, that :1s one of our basic

contentions in this case, that the October 21st proceeding in
the U„So District Court was not alleged to be an ancillary

6
proceeding in this inconsistent declarations prosection.

And

even though the Appellate Court affirmed the conviction by
looking to that proceeding and indicating that Dunn, by adopt­
ing that statement, had somehow turned the September 30th
proceeding into an ancillary proceeding, we submit that was
outside the indictment and the proper amendment or prejudicial
variance from the indictment.
QUESTION:
MR. SEARS:

How did it prejudice you?
Your Honor, prejudice in our preparation

for the case in that we were preparing to go to trial contest­
ing the ancillariness of the September 30th proceeding rather
than the October 21st proceeding.

The October 21st proceeding

was not mentioned in the indictment whatsoever.
QUESTION:
MR. SEARS:
QUESTION:
MR. SEARS:

Nell, you knew it had taken place?
Pardon?
You knew it had taken place.
We did know it had taken place, Your

Honor, but as the Assistant United States Attorney conceded
prior to the introduction of that transcript and as we indi­
cated to the Court, we had not been provided with a copy of
that transcript under rule 16, and the government attorney
conceded that he did not contemplate this evidence in the
case in chief.

There was no mention of the October 21st pro­

ceeding in the indictment whatsoever.
QUESTION:

Well, how factually were you prejudiced?

7
MR0 SEARS:

Your Honor, we were prejudiced on the

basis that our defense had been prepared to challenge the
ancmariness of the September 30th proceeding and not the
October 21st —
QUESTION:

So you couldn't use it, but how were you

disadvantaged by your inability you had to challenge the
October proceeding?
MR. SEARS:

Your Honor, the only way I can respond

to His Honor8s question is that we did not have sufficient
notice to prepare a theory in that regard and we were not ex­
pecting that we were going to have to meet that evidence as a
basis for an ancillary proceeding as the court subsequently
ruled.
QUESTION:

Do you regard this situation as a prose­

cution blunder?
MR, SEARS:

Quite candidly, Your Honor, yes»

Your Honor, as a result of the —
QUESTION:

Mr. Sears, you don’t disagree with the

fact that the October 21st proceeding was a proceeding in the
meaning of the statute, do you?
MR. SEARS:
gard.

I don't challenge that in the least re­

The only thing I would question. Your Honor, is whether

that proceeding — whether a prosecution could be made out of
that proceeding as well, based upon our same objection that
the immunized testimony could not be used.

Yes, it was a

8
proceeding before the court under 1623.
QUESTION:

As I remember the Solicitor General’s

brief* he agrees with you that they must establish that the
September 30th affidavit was a proceeding in order to sustain
the process —
MR. SEARS:
QUESTION:
MR. SEARS:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
He agrees to that.
Yes, with our position.
The S.G. does it in one way in contrast

with the way the Tenth Circuit did.
MR. SEARS:

I believe that was part of our suggestion.

Your Honors, on December 15, 1976, Dunn was subse­
quently Indicted on five counts of false declarations before
a grand jury in violation of section 1623.

Paragraph one of

each count alleged that Dunn had made false declarations before
the grand jury on June 16, 1976. And paragraph four of each
respective counts, they set out the specific declarations
relied upon.

Paragraph five of each count charged that Dunn

knowingly made declarations on September 30, 1976, and then
the sixth paragraph indicated that the declarations that had
been made in the September 30th proceeding in Canges* office
and the June 16th proceeding were Inconsistent to the degree
that one of them was necessarily false.
Due to the confusion from the first paragraph, the
charge that he had testified falsely before the grand jury on
June 16th, and the fourth and fifth paragraphs which indicated

9
that he had testified falsely In the September 30th proceeding
we passed them a bill of particulars to seek out the govern­
ment theory in which they were relying to prove this ease,
whether they were intending to use the September 30th statement
as an admission that his declarations before the grand jury
were false or, conversely, whether they were relying on the
subsection (c) theory of inconsistent declarations, in other
words, submitting that the declarations were so inherently in­
consistent that one of them had to be false»
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t a bill of particulars to pro­

vide facts?
MFL SEARS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, and —
If the government states facts in an in­

dictment or information which show that a crime has been com­
mitted, it doesn’t have to tell you its legal theory, does it?
MR» SEARS:

No, it doesn’t have to state the legal

theory, Your Honor, insofar as it need not further explain the
#

indictment or the defense which the defense must meet»

My

understanding of the bill of particulars has always been two­
fold, to more adequately explain the charp*e and to protect
against a double jeopardy claim.

So that by considering the

charge in the record, a similar charge could not be made, and
I wubmit that is exactly what we have in this case, by looking
at not only

at the September 30th but the October 21st for

the ancillariness.

10
QUESTION:
MRo SEARS:
QUESTION:
MR. SEARS:

And you received an answer?
Pardon?
You received an answer?
Not in the way of a form of a bill of

particulars, but the government did respond that it was going
to rely on the 1623(e) inconsistent declarations theory, and
that theory was submitted throughout the course of the case*
QUESTION:

And that was the submission to the jury?

MRo SEARS:

That Is correct, and the court so in­

structed the jury that the government need not prove which of
the declarations was false.
At trial, the September 30th transcription of Dunn's
statement, which I will refer to as the canned statement, was
introduced and conferred to the District Court and testified
that they received it as an exhibit on October 12, 1976 in
the Musgrave case,

On cross-examination, the clerk was asked

to identify the Immunity order and application identified as
Defendant's Exhibits P-1 and P-2 entered prior to Dunn’s
appearance and testimony before the grand jury.

The notary

public was then called to the stand and asked to Identify the
September 30th canned statement which had been rendered on
September 30, 1976.

He indicated, however, on cross-examination

that Dunn did not have counsel of his own choosing in the
office of Musgrave’s attorney, he was not familiar with the
criminal deposition procedures under 18 U.S.C.j section 3503,

11
no court order had been obtained for the taking of this depo­
sition, and there was no indication that Dunn would be unavail­
able for trial, which we submit are necessary requirements for
this document to qualify as a deposition under 3505.
Finally, the government offered the Canges statement,
the defense objected that it did not qualify as proceedings
ancillary or before the U.8. Court or a grand jury.

The govern­

ment next introduced Dunn’s grand jury testimony through the
Assistant United States Attorney who conducted the Musgrave
grand jury investigation.

On cross-examination, however, the

Assistant United States Attorney admitted that there was no
independent evidence but for Dunn’s recantations of September
30th and October 21st to disbelieve the grand jury testimony,
and that there was much evidence to corroborate the truth of
It.
The defense objected to the use of the grand jury
testimony on the basis that it was in violation of his immunity
order.

Both of those objections were overruled and both ex­

hibits were admitted into evidence.
Then the government further offered a transcript of
the October 21, 3.976 evidentiary hearing in U.S. District
Court.

The defense objected that these declarations were not

outlined in the allegations of the indictment, that it was
beyond the proper scope of the indictment.
did concede that prior to tria

The government

this evidence had not been

12
submitted to the defense and was not intended as evidence in
the case in chief.

His response was, since we had cross-

examined the Assistant UcS„ Attorney as to the truthfulness of
the grand jury testimony, he wanted to offset that testimony by
the use of the subsequent reaffirmation to lend credence to
the September 30fch statement.

The government rested and Dunn

did not have to testify.
The defense then moved for a judgment of acquittal
on two bases, that the immunized grand jury testimony could not
be used against him to establish the corpus delicti and an
inconsistent declarations prosecution, and that the Canges
statement was not an ancillary proceeding under section 1623.
The trial court ruled that the Canges statement, if not
originally ancillary, "channeled its way into being an ancillary proceeding" on the confirmation in the TJ0S, District Court
on October 21st.

However, the United States Circuit Court of

Appeals agreed with Dunn’s position and said that the
September 30th statement was not an ancillary proceeding as
the statute requires.

The court, however, found that the

October 21st proceeding "was ancillary and affirmed the con­
viction on that basis, even though that proceeding had not been
set out in the indictment0
The court found, "It was a proceeding ancillary to
the grand jury because of Dunn’s subsequent reaffirmation and
adoption of the earlier statement on October 21st," in other

13
words,, look to the October 21st proceeding as an affirmation of
the earlier September 30th proceeding.

The court held that its

admission of the October 21st statement into evidence was not
a prejudicial variance because the defense could have contem­
plated it0
Now, Your Honors, we submit that since the indictment
charged the June 16th and the September 30th statements as be­
ing proceedings ancillary — either before or ancillary to a
O.S, court or a grand jury and set out the declarations in
each of those two proceedings which were alleged to be consis­
tent 9 the only question for the jury was were the declarations
in those three separate proceedings so inherently inconsistent
that one of them had to be false„

We submit that the October

21st proceeding had no proper purpose in this hearing»

Solicitor General argues that it could have offset any conten­
tion that the statements were a matter of mistake or inadver­

proceedings charged in the indictment were so inherently in­
consistent —»

ings, are we?

MR. SEAIJS:

Your Honor, I submit that due to the

t

peculiar nature of proof under section 1623(c) theory,

that is only the declarations that are specifically set out
in the two proceedings that can be at issue before either the
trial court or jury.
QUESTION:

And the government agrees with you on

that here in this Court?
MR. SEARS:

Yes.

And I would submit that the only

question of prejudice would come if the October 21 — if we
were considering whether the October 21st admissions were
Improperly introduced into evidence.

Other than that, we

would submit they had no proper bearing on the ease, and
whether or not —■
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1:00 o’clock.
MR. SEARS:

Thank you, Your Honors.

(Whereupon, at 3,2:00 o’clock, noon, the Court was
recessed until 1:00 o’clock p.m.)

15
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

1:00 P.M.

You may continue, Mr.

Sears.
MR. SEARS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Your Honors, if I might address further In response
to His Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question with regard to
whether or not the defendant Dunn

was prejudice by the

government's action in this case, I would submit that if the
Court finds a constructive amendment to the indictment in
this case under the reasoning of Stirone v. United States,
prejudice need not be found.

Or if the Court feels that the

proceedings In which the government introduced evidence
against Mr. Dunn, particularly the October 21st proceedings
were at variance in pleading a proof, then we would submit
that prejudice would have to be found under that reasoning.
Your Honors, with regard to the Stirone case, I
would submit that the prejudice against Dunn may be more
grievous than Mr. Stirone realised under the facts underlying
that case.

The Court will recall in Stirone that the

defendant was charged with a Hobbs Act violation, and the
specific allegation in the indictment was the interstate
commerce particular portion of the allegation which concerned
shipping sand Into the State of Pennsylvania to construct a
steel plant, or the trial, the government Instead proved that

steel was going to be shipped out of Pennsylvania and that was
the Interstate element that the jury should look to, and this
Honorable Court in that particular proceeding found that
while there was a variance in the sense of a variation be­
tween pleading and proof;, the variation here destroyed the
defendant's substantial right to be tried only on those
charges presented in an indictment returned by a grand jury»
Or further stated, deprivation of such a basic right is far
too serious to be treated as nothing more than a variance
and then dismissed as harmless error.

1 would submit that

the Stirone case has been popularly referred to as a construc­
tive amendment, even though I would Interpret the Court's
language

to proceed on a prejudicial variance basis.

Your Honors, the

Tenth Circuit also determined,

aside from the ancillary issue, that Dunn's immunized testi­
mony could be used against him in an inconsistent declaration,
prosecution because his subsequent affirmation, first of all,
his recantation in the September 30th proceeding and his
subsequent affirmation in the October 20th proceeding, con­
tained the admission by him that his grand jury testimony was
false.

And it was due to this possible conclusion that the

defense on cross-examination of the Assistant United States
Attorney at trial established that there was independent

Counsel, you mentioned the Bain case,

Hasn’t that case been primarily notable for the fact that

MR0 SEARS:

Your Honor, I don’t recall the specific

holding in the Bain case, but as I recall that case stood for
the proposition that — well, I would have to confess, I just
don't recall the holding In Bain»

I would call the Court's

attention, however, to — this Honorable Court's holding in
Kastigar and Murphy, which I think are quite crucial to the
consideration of the issues here, and mo^e recently in New
Jersey v. Port Ash, which was decided on March 20th„ and that
is that when an individual’s immunized testimony cannot be
used against him in Port Ash for impeachment purposes, it is
compelled testimony, and In Kastigar, deciding the extent of

6002 Immunity, the implication was there that it could not be
used for any purpose, that the witness who had testified under
immunity was in substantially the same position if he had —
QUESTION:

Was that rather broad statement neces­

sary to the holding?
MR. SEARS:

Your Honor, I believe It was, particu­

larly in view of the Court’s recent statement in Port Ash.
QUESTION:
MR. SEARS:

Was it necessary in Port Ash?
I believe it was, Your Honor, if we are

to maintain the holding that when a witness is compelled to
testify, it completely displaces his Fifth Amendment privilege.
QUESTION:

Yes, but his privilege is not to incrim­

MR. SEARS:

His privilege is not to incriminate him­

Not to be compelled to incriminate him

MR, SEARS:

That’s correct, Your Honor, plus not to

have any evidence that is forced from his lips to either use
against him in any criminal proceeding,
QUESTION:
Issue In the case.

Well, that solves your case, that Is the
That is really the Issue in the case.

But

in terms of any past crime, certa3.nly the use that was made
here didn’t incriminate him.

Using his grand jury testimony

to prove that he might have told a lie in the future wasn’t
.used.
MR, SEARS:

Your Honor, It didn't directly incrimin­

ate him, but It certainly furnished derivative evidence which
the government relied upon to subsequently convict him.

It

produced evidence which the government used to establish the
corpus delicti of a crime.
QUESTION:
MR. SEARS:

Future crime, that’s right,
Well, Your Honor, it really wasn’t

future crime because it was testimony under — in response
to the ordered Immunity.

The government didn’t prove that he

lied In the October 21st proceeding, nor even the September
21st proceeding.

It proved that he went before the —

appearance in court, this later appearance in court, suppose

tain your position with respect to the inconsistent •—
MRffl SEARS:
QUESTION:

No question about it»
You concede that if the prosecution had

been for perjury before the grand jury in his immunized testi­
mony, that would have been valid?
MR. SEARS:

Clearly.

I would submit it would fall

within the exception to the immunity»
QUESTION:
MR» SEARS:

And which you accept?
Yes*

Your Honor, what 1 would submit to

the Court is that when he was ordered to testify, the govern­
ment in its allegation to the court, and the court in Its
order upon that application promised that his testimony would

21
not be used against him directly or Indirectly in any criminal
proceedings against him.
It was used directly.

That is in essence what happened.

And the testimony was used directly

against — this Court decided that it could not be used for
impeachment purposes in the Port Ash case.
QUESTION:

Would that apply to a cri.me not yet

committed., actions not yet committed?
MR. SEARS:

Your Honor, 1 submit that is where the

government is confusing transactional immunity and use im­
munity, and I would submit that in the Kastigar ruling if a
witness testifies before a grand jury on certain subject
matters and then later goes out and commits a crime which may
pertain to that subject matter, transactional 5,mmunity would
not protect him.

I would submit that that would be a broader

protection than the Fifth Amendment should offer him.
However, when the very testimony that is compelled
from his lips is used to prove a crime against him, is part
of the corpus delicti of that crime, then we must examine
whether that testimony falls within the exception to the im­
munity.

Unless he has violated his bargain with the govern­

ment and the courts by testifying falsely or otherwise fail­
ing to comply with that order, failing to testify and com­
mitting contempt, then I submit that he must be protected by
that immunity.

And I would submit the reasoning of that must

be consistent with the government5 s positions In several

22
other cases that have come up, one which is before the Court
*

and which the Court has recently granted cert, in Apfelbaum,
but more particularly in Patrick and Housand and the
BerardelXi line of reasoning.

If the courts are going to

continue to compel witnesses to

testify under an order of

immunity, on the promise that it will not be used against
them in an inconsistent declarations prosecution, regardless
of whether it is prior to or subsequent to, as long as it is
part of that corpus delicti of inconsistent prosecution, you
cannot subsequently use that testimony in convicting someone
without establishing that he has violated his immunity bargain,
and we submit that it cannot be used

against Mr, Dunn in

thi.; proceeding.
QUESTION:

But you agree, I take it, that immunity

needn't be no broader than a privilege?
MR„ SEARS:

Absolutely,

I subm3.t that it is no

broader by protecting Mr, Dunn from the use of his very
possibly enlightened truth testimony when he did testify in
compliance vrith the court's order,
QUESTION:

Well, suppose later some other person was

charged with a murder or a robber:/ or something and also your
client was charged with that later robbery also and it is

turns out that in his grand jury testimony that we are talking

QUESTION:

And do you say that his grand jury testi­

mony then would not be admissible against him in the later
prosecution?
ME. SEARS:

I would say that the grand jury testi­

mony could not be used against him9 but had he had transaction
al immunity it would have protected him if the government
could establish by extraneous evidence the crime, he is not
protected from prosecution -QUESTION:

No, I understand, but you say that in his

prosecution for the later robbery along with somebody else,
his grand jury testimony cannot be used against him.
MR. SEARS:

That’s correct, Your Honor, as long as

it was truthful and as long as the government cannot prove
that it was false or that he had otherwise violated his im­
munity .
Your Honor, the few remaining moments I have I would
like to reserve for rebuttal.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr» Frey, you may proceed.

24
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This is a case in which it is clear that the pe­
titioner lied either in his grand jury testimony or in his
subsequent sworn refutation of that testimony.

This is also

a case in which it is clear that the false swearing by the
petitioner adversely affected the administration of justice
either by causing Mr. Musgrave to be wrongfully indicted of
a felony or by forcing the government to drop the felony
charges against Mr. Musgrave although they were to 11-founded.
The question before this Court is whether the pe­
titioner' ’s perjury, palpable on its face with the compar'ison
of the contradictory statements, may be proved, by placing
those statements before the

jury or whether the immunity

granted in connection with the first of those statements pre­
cludes such a course from occurring.
The case also involves an issue of balance, of
whether the September 3 0th statement in Musgrave*s lawyer's
office was a proceeding ancillary to a court, and if not,
whether that is fatal to the prosecution in this case.

I in­

tend to rely on our brief on this point unless the Court has
any questions and move on to the more important constitutional
immunity point.

QUESTI®'!:

You concede that unless the transaction

in the laser's office was under the statute, then this con­
dition cannot stand?
MR. FREY:
to a court.

We do, but we say that it was ancillary

I might point out in that connection that if the

Court were to hold that this kind of proceeding which is
essentially in preparation of an affidavit for submission to
the court, it is not ancillary to a court.

It would have

consequences beyond the rather unusual circumstances of this
case because it would affect similar litigation where it is
common place to submit affidavits in connection with opposi­
tion to summary judgments and motions and trial, and after
having forced to trial the testimony might be proved as con­
tradictory -—
QUESTION:

Where would a pretrial deposition come

MR. FREY:

It would also be ancillary to a court if

in this?

it is taken for use in a judicial proceeding.
QUESTION:

I think the petitioner concedes that.

MR. FREY?

He concedes it as to a deposition.

We don't contend that this was a deposition.
QUESTION:

No, I know that.

This was an affidavit

prepared in a lawyer's office.
MR. FREY;

This is an affidavit and we say it is like

the affidavit that would be prepared for a summary judgment and

26
also in connection with a 2255 proceeding motion.
QUESTION:

Just one other point on that, Mr. Frey,

If instead of using the affidavit in the October 21st hearing,
ft

they merely put the man on the stand and had the affidavit
there in order — as you have often with an affidavit, have
an affidavit with which you could impeach him if necessary,
do you still say it was a proceeding?
MR. PREY:

'Nell, we are not saying -- this is not

the October 21st —■
QUESTION:

Are you still saying the September 30th

MR. FREY:

We are — our position is that the

September 3 0th proceeding — when these statements are then
admitted as a proceeding ancillary —
QUESTION:

And you would take the same position even

if there had never been a proceeding on October 21st?
MR. FREY:

We take that position, but we have the

alternative argument, that if the court is not satisfied with

i

;

t#at, that at least the affidavit was in fact submitted to the
court. —
/
QUESTION:

And have the effect of making it ~-

MR. FREY;

If he gives sworn testimony that he knows

is used in connection with the federal court case, I don't
think he can be heard to complain later on that it ms sub­
mitted to the court and he didn't expect it.

I think he takes

27
his chances that he —
QUESTION:

Sure, he took fcha chance that, you could

have indicted him on the October 21st proceeding also,
couldn't he?
MR. FREY:

Well, I think it is clear that we could

have indicted him for the October 21st proceeding, I don’t
think that is really disputed.
QUESTION:

I would think your affidavit by itself

contention is a good deal weaker than your deposition type of
contention because of the word "proceeding” in the statute.
I think it is a common practice for people just to be handed
affidavits and, sura, they are told they have to swear to
them arid there is a notary in the room, but they may not read
every word of it.

That is not. to say that false statements

may not be punishable.

But it is kind of hard to envision the

signing of an affidavit as a proceeding.
MR. FREYs

Well, that, it seems to me, goes — the

kind of concern that we are addressing is an issue for the
jury as to his intent and knowledge in making the statements.
QUESTION;

Well, the formality of the situation —

MR. FREY:

Well, I am not suggesting that this is

in fact a deposition.

We are suggesting that he knew that it

was for use in a court proceeding and that indeed he later on
participated in its presentation in a court, proceeding.
QUESTION:

You are really saying that it is the

23
functional equivalent,to use that phrase, of a deposition,
aren’t you?
MR. FREY:

Well, in some respects, but counsel for

both parties to the case were not present and since it is in
connection with the criminal case there are restrictions on
depositions that don’t exist in civil, cases.
QUESTION:

There is no hostility between the person

who signed the affidavit and the person who presumably pre­
pared it here, is there?
MR. FREY:

In this case — well, I can't say whether

there was hostility or not, but they were both on the sfiiu©
side in the case, whether there -were motivations or feelings
or not —•

Well, does that cut in favor or against

you, really, because the proceeding concept to me suggests a
criminal type of situation where you could have perhaps adver ­
sary parties and that sort of thing.
MR, FREY:

Well, I think our view is that this is a

proceeding ancillary to the court.

I agree that it is not as

formal as many proceedings ancillary to the court would be.
I think if the Court determines that it is not a proceeding

29
ancillary to a court, even though it was thereafter submitted
to the court, as I say,

.it vail create a significant gap in

the coveted 1623, which was designed to protect judicial
proceedings basically and to give added protection of the
further statute 1621 which covers all —
QUESTION:

Well, what if it was thereafter sub­

mitted to the court, what if it was simply a naked affidavit?
MR. FREY:

Well, I would say that if he simply pre­

pared an affidavit and put it. in the mail to Mu s grave8 s
lawyer, that would be a much more difficult case and I am not
clear that we would contend that that was a proceeding.
QUESTION:

Or if the affidavit had

in the court, wasn't it?
MR. FREY:

Indeed,

it was.

He testified in the

court that the statements that he had made were totally true
and that his grand jury testimony —
QUESTION:

But the affidavit itself was filed and

it was the basis for a motion, wasn't it?
MR. FREY:

I think so.

QUESTION:

On which there was a hearing,

MR. FREY:

That's right.

QUESTIONi

So to that extent it was quite similar to

summary judgment in a civil case?

MR. FREY;

It is very similar.

QUESTION;

As I understand your position, just to

be sure I air. right, you would take the same position if
instead of it happening in the lawyer's office, the lawyer
had sent an investigator out to his house, for example, and
got him to sign the affidavit and then they never even filed
the affidavit in court, you would still say the same thing?
MR. FREY:

I suggest that I would have a lot more

difficulty with that.

Mr. Frey, before you get to that, though,

if you lose this first issue, we have to meet the second one?
MR. FREY:

Well, I don't think you have to meet the

second issue, but we suggest that you should meet the second
issue because what will happen in all likelihood is that we
will go back and reindict Mr. Dunn on either of two theories,
either we could use a 1621 indictment, that is a straight
perjury indictment showing that his testimony in the lawyer's
office was false and using his grand jury testimony as evi­
dence in that, or more likely we will charge an inconsistency
between the grand jury testimony and the October 21st court
testimony which concededly was a proceeding before a court.

QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals might be right.

MR. FREY;

They might be right.

QUESTION:

In which event we reach the other.

MR. FREY:

You ‘would.

On turning to that issue, our

position on the constitutionality of the use that we made of
petitioner's immunized grand jury testimony in this case is
the product of two propositions, both of which we believe to
be reasonably well settled.

The first proposition is that the

35
immunity that must be granted to displace a valid claim of
privilege against self-incrimination has to be coextensive
with but need not be any broader than the scope of the
privilege which was available to the witness at the time he
invoked it.
In other words, when the government seeks to make
some use of compelled testimony against the witness who gave
that testimony, the permissibility of making that use can be
ascertained by asking yourself the question could he have in­
voked the privilege against compulsory se3.f~in.cramination to
refuse to answer to guard against this prospective use of his
testimony.
Now, the second proposition on which we rest is that
at the time the petitioner was called to testify before the
grand jury and invoked his privilege, he could not have
validly invoked his privilege on the grounds that later on he
might choose to give contradictory testimony and he did not
want to create evidence now that could be used to show the
falsity of subsequent non -immunized testimony.
Now,

if those two propositions are accepted, I think

we win the case, and I don't understand the petitioner to con­
test the second of those, that, is that he could not have
invoked the privilege solely on the ground of a possible future
perjury.

He does, however,

stoutly maintain that Ms immunity

is sweeping regardless of the scope of his privilege at the

36
time he acquired the immunity.

In other words, he said he

validly invoked the privilege with regard to his drug dealings
at the Colorado State Penitentiary, something which we don’t
dispute.

Consequently, he says the government may not make

any use of his immunized testimony but must leave him in the
same position as if he had not teen compelled to testify.
So the question before the Court is whether a valid
claim, of the privilege is an immunity bath as to any criminal
case is of immunised testimony or, as ws argue, does it only
provide immunity coextensive with the privilege.
Now, the Court’s prior decisions look our way on this
issue.

Nearly seventy years ago, in Glickstein and in Heike,

the Court stated the basic principle that is central to our
constitutional analysis.

For* instance, in Glickstein, the

Court said that the immunity is required to be complete.

that

is to say in all respects commensurate with the protection
guaranteed by the constitutional limitation, according to the
privilege against self“incrimination.
In Heike, the Court said that in order to avoid
giving what is called a gratuity to crime, the immunity
ordered under the statute that was there in question should be
construed "as coterminous with what otherwise would have teen
the privilege of the persons concerned. ’’
Now- the same theme is central between the privilege
and the immunity and also underlays this Court’s decisions in

37
Murphy v. Waterfront Commission and in Kastigar.

It is clear

from those decisions that the Court has held that what the
Constitution requires in the way of immunity is defined by
the privilege that the witness has.
QUESTION;

And the privilege? of course? was not to

testify at all.
MR. FREY;

Well? I understand that? but let me point

out the fallacy in his position that, he must be left in the
same position as if he had not testified at all.
QUESTIONs

The first —

You would agree that that would be the

consequence of the exercise of the privilege? would be not to
testify at all?
MR. FREY;

Yes? and he would save himself a lot of

inconvenience and he would save himself possibly losing his
job? he would save himself public oblique? he would save him­
self many inconveniences? but the fact is that he is not left
in the same position when he is compelled to testify as he
would have been had the -QUESTION;
ment.

QUESTION;

That is another privilege? not to testify

at all, as I understand it, it is a privilege not to compul­
sorily incriminate himself.
MR. FREY i

I agree, although as to the particular

questions that ware asked here, he had a right not to answer
those questions because his answer would have teen self™
incr im ina fc or y.
QUESTION:

Even in a trial court, the privilege is

not absolute just bv its assertion, is it?
MR. FREY:

That's true, it is not —

QUESTION;

There can ba inquiry by the court, to de­

termine whether it is validly asserted.
MR, FREY:

A privilege exists only in the areas

where he has a risk of current self-incrimination, which of
course is the point that we are saying here, that he doesn't
have.
New, the fallacy in the notion that he should be in
the same position as if he had been allowed to remain silent
is illustrated by the fact that he can be prosecuted for per­
jury in making those statements.

He clear'ly is not in the

same position as if he had remained silent.
And looking one step beyond that, why is it that he
can be prosecuted for perjury?

Well, I think the reason why

he can be prosecuted for perjury is that his privilege did not
entitle him to commit perjury.

He couldn’t invoke the

privilege on the grounds that his statements might be false and

39
be used against him in a perjury trial.
We say the vex’y same thing is true here.

He could

not invoke his privilege to guard against the use that we
have made of his testimony in this case, so therefore I don't
think this argument is right.
Mow, we also illustrate our point by looking at the
situation with transactional immunity.

I think it was clear

in Kastigar and the cases before Kastigar that transactional
immunity satisfied the requirements of privilege against selfincrimination.

The statute no longer allows it, but if the

petitioner had been given transactional immunity as once was
permitted, his statements could have been used against him to
prove subsequent perjury because the transactional immunity
would have been with regard to the offenses about which he was
being compelled to testify.
Now, his answer to this analysis is to invoke cer­
tain language in Kastigar and in Port.ash, but we don’t think
that that language was addressed to the problems we have in
this case at all»

The Court was not examining in that case

the question of whether the immunity must exceed the scope of
the privilege.

In both cases, what the Court was talking

about, was the uses, that the witness would, have been privileged
to resist at the time the testimony was compelled.

In

Kastigar, the Court was concerned with whether the use and
derivative use immunity was sufficient to displace the.

40
privilege/ and in that respect the Court was comparing it
transactional immunity and the Court was saying that use and
derivative use immunity, since it protects use in any respect
of his evidence, is sufficient.

Clearly they were focusing

on use to prove the crime about which he was requires to
testify.
\

Porfcash is exactly the same situation.

It is clear

from the Court®s holding that Portash had a right to invoke
his privilege against self-incrimination to guard against the
use of compelled testimony, to impeach him should he be
prosecuted for the crimes about which he testified.
So this case is completely different

and you can't

simply lift that language out of the cases and in effect
either automatically or unthinkingly apply it to this quite
different situation.
‘

f

....

Now, even if the Constitution permits the kind of use
of immunized testimony that was made in the present case,
there does remain a question of whether such use is bothered
by the immunity statute, section 6002, and we, of course, con­
tend that the statute does not bar its use.
On the exclusive inclusion in the last clause of
section 6002 are flasa statement prosecutions, but there is a
more fundamental point that shows that the statute is no bar
to the kind of use made here so long as that use is consti­
tutional and permissible.

This Court has construed immunity

41
provisions like that in 6002 in a number of prior cases.
In Glickstein, for instance, it was confronted with
a statute which barred use of immunized testimony in any pro­
ceeding and it held that, that statute did not bar use in a
perjury prosecution.

And in Bryan, the Court held that a

statute which barred any use "except in a prosecution for
perjury” did not bar us® in a con tempt case.
Now, in both of these cases the Court recognised that
the kind of language that we are dealing with in the immunity
statute here refers to use in connection with a prosecution
for the offense that is disclosed by the testimony itself,
and not for future offenses such as contempt or perjury as to
which the privilege was unavailable at the time of the com­
pelled testimony.
Now, the Court in this case should analysis the pro­
viso to section 6002 in precisely the same manner.

And if it

does so, it will be giving to that statute the meaning that
Congress intended.

The immunity statute was based closely on
I

the report of the National Commission on Reform of Federal
Criminal Lav/s.

That commission proposed that "the immunity

conferred would be confined to the scope required by the Fifth
Amendment."
In both the House and Senate reports, it is stated
explicitly,

:,This statutory immunity is intended to be as

broad as but no broader than the privilege against

42
self-incrimination."
Now, the last clause in section 6002 which specific­
ally lists perjury, false statements and the third clause
which I think basically they had in mind was contempt cases,
was added not as a limitation on the use that could be made
of immunized testimony but out of an abundance of caution to
make sure that no court would prohibit as long as the
Constitution allowed it, that no court would prohibit the use
in a perjury case or a false statement case or a contempt
case.
Now, the same policy concerns that led the Court in
Glickstein and in Bryan to refuse to read the limitation into
the immunity statutes in those cases are also operative here.
In effect, what the Court said in Glickstein and in Bryan is
that Congress can't really have meant, we can’t believe that
Congress meant to protect the defendant or the witness against
a perjury or a contempt prosecution even though the Constitu­
tion doesn’t require it, because that would defeat in large
part the purpose of giving him the immunity.
Now, the same thing is 'true in this case.

He is

given immunity, he is compelled to testify, and then he walks
out of the grand jury and a couple of weeks later he encounters
the defendant who is now indicted and the defendant apparently
by whatever means persuades him to recant his testimony.

The

recantation has totally destroyed the value of the immunity

43
that this witness was given.

It is on the usefulness of the

statutory scheme that Congress created it, and I think it
would be very unfortunate and certainly not what Congress
would have wanted if in the future when situations like this
arise, an indicted defendant can say to a witness who gave
immunized testimony, well, you can recant it, don’t worry,
look at Dunn v. United States, they can’t use your grand jury
testimony to show that you are lying the second time around.
So in sum we suggest that neither the Constitution
nor the statute bars the use that we made of the immunized
testimony in this case and accordingly the judgment of the
Court of Appeals should be affirmed.
QUESTION;

You are really suggesting that the agree­

ment on the immunity should be ignored for failure of consid­
eration in effect?
MR. FREYs

Vfell, that is a secondary argument.

My

first, argument is that the agreement never encompassed a
promise not to make the kind of use that the government made
in this case, that the Constitution doesn’t require that kind
of a promise, that it would be foolish for us,as Justice White
said in his concurrence in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission,
that it would be harmfully and wastefully broad construction
of the
QUESTION:

Wasn't this even more specifically said

by my Brother Brennan in the Freed case in this —

MR. PREY:

Yes.

I think the Freed case, of course,

is a case on. which we quite strongly rely and is a case in
which — it didn’t deal with an immunity statute that was
subject to the construction that there was a statutory bar
to a particular use, and I think that is what I v/as trying co
address in answering the Chief Justice's question.

On the

constitutional point, Freed is very strong support for vis be­
cause, of course, in Freed there was a statute that gave only
contemporaneous past offense immunity and not future offense
immunity and the Court unanimously held, both the Court’s
opinion arid Justice Brennan emphasized that he couldn’t com­
plain that his statement might be used against him in connec­
tion with a future offense.

Me have relied heavily in our

brief on that point.
But there is an argument here that the Constitution
raay allow the government to do ifc. but the statute doesn't
allow it, and it is to that argument that I was addressing the
Chief Justice's question, and I was saying that first of all
there was no bargain with him that we wouldn't make the kind
of use that we made.

And secondly, I think the Chief Justice

is right in suggesting that from a policy standpoint he has
robbed us of what we were entitled to, but once he got that
immunity we were entitled to his truthful testimony and he
has undone, taken away the value of that by going out and
giving sworn recantation of that testimony which destroyed the

45
prosecution.
QUESTION

Mr. Frey, this is really an answer, if I

understand you correctly, to the statutory argument based on
the words "or otherwise," because you are in effect saying
that by recanting he breached the substance of the order just
as much as if he had given false testimony in the first place.
MR. FREY:

Well, I am saying that and it is —

obviously, the problem only arises because the otherwise
language is susceptible to the limiting construction.
QUESTION:

But even if you give it the limiting

construction., it seems to me you've made am answer in the
sensei that just as he had an obligation to tell the truth, .he
also implicitly has agreed not to recant.
MR. FREY:

Well, I suggest that and I suggest that

a contrary construction of the construction adverse to our
position would not comport, with what Congress must have in­
tended .
Ti^ank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL J. SEARS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER ~ REBUTTAL
MR. SEARS:

Mr. Chief Justice, if I may just have a

few concluding remarks.
Your Honors, respondent's argument has proceeded on

46
th© basis that if this Court rules that immunized testimony
cannot be used in establishing the corpus delicti of an in­
consistent declarations prosecution, that that means anybody
has a free license to commit perjury.

That is not what we

are contending in this case.
We are merely contending that the government is
obliged once it offers immunity to prove that a man has
perjured himself under testimony.
in this case.

That was not established

To tbs contrary, the evidence in the record

was that there was much to believe the truthfulness of Dunn’s
grand jury testimony under compulsion.
QUESTION:

Do you think the government got what it

bargained for?
i

MR. SEARS:

Your Honor, I have to concede that what

Mr. Dunn did is repugnant to every moral obligation, but I
submit that it was not a violation of section 1623 and that
section 1623(c) was not a proper method of proof.
QUESTION:

But he is still claiming all the benefits

of that bargain, isn't he?
MR. SEARS:

Your Honor, he has a right to claim the

benefits of that bargain and, yes, he is.
QUESTION:
MR. SEARS:

Without any adjustment in price?
YOur Honor, I submit that the government

had its options available.

It had the option of taking the

September 30th transcript as extrinsic evidence and proving

that he lied before the grand jury.

Of course, then the de­

fense would have the right to defend his grand jury declarations were truthful.

That was never a theory in the case.

If the government ■—

You don't want to cut that out, do you?

MR. SEARS:

Your Honor, only if he recants in

another ancillary proceeding, but that is not what happened in
this case.

And unless the government is going to go that

one additional step and provide extrinsic evidence to prove
that one of his declarations was false under 1623 , then no
violation ensues.

And simply because he testifies inconsis­

tently, and it seems to me this was a proceeding under which
hockenberry and Scanento and some of the other cases proceeded,
which this Court need not accept and I think which was
alluded to in. the Court ruling last week, is that if he does
testify truthfully it should not be used against him for
impeachment or in any criminal proceedings whatsoever, and
that is what we ask the Court to do.
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:45 o'clock p.m., the case in the
