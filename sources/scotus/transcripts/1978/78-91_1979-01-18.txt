E.5.9.CEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will receive arguments

next in No. 78-91, Jones against Wolf.
Mr. Prettyman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I am Barry Prettyman, Junior and I represent the
Petitioners in this case who, in turn, represent a class
claiming to be the True Congregation of the Vineville Presby­
terian Church in Macon, Georgia.
Since 1904, that church has been a member of the
Augusta, Macon Presbytery which in turn is a part of the
Presbyterian Church of the United States which I will call
P.C.U.S. in shorthand for purposes of this argument.
As this Court noted in the Hull case and as the trial
court, held this case, P.C.U.S. is a hierarcliial church.

It

has an ascending order of judicatories beginning with the local
church session made up of the Minister and its Elders then pro­
ceeding up to the Presbytery which includes ministers and el­
ders from a number of churches and then the Synod, which in­
cludes a number of Presbyteries and finally, the General
Assembly, -the single group that is the highest court and re­
presents all the churches under P.C.U.S.

4
Each of these bodies is called '"Church Court” and
each has the power under the P.C.U.S. Constitution to review
and overrule the actions of the court below it.

Moreover,,

each can appoint a commission to act in its place —
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Prettyman, if that means

that the succession is the court of first instance?
MR. PRETTYMAN;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And that is

MR. PRETTYMAN:

composed of —?

That is composed of the Minister

and elected Elders of the local church.
Now, each of these courts can appoint a commission
to act in its place and to report to it and every member —
this is important, every member who joins P.C.U.S. and any of
its churches,

takes a vow or an oath to be bound by the

P.C.U.S. structure and constitution which is principally em­
bodied in the Book of Church Order which is part of the record
in this case.
Back in May, 1973 certain members voted at a meeting
165-94 to adopt a resolution separating the Vineville Presby­
terian Church from the Augusta, Macon Presbytery and from
P.C.U.S. and to be an independent church.

The Respondents hers

represent a class made up of that majority vote and likewise,
the Petitioners represent a class of the minority in that vote..
The majority struck the minority members' names from
the rolls and refused to let them use the church property as a

5
unit of the U.S. and the majority subsequently joined the
Presbyterian Church in America which is an entirely separate
group totally unrelated to P.C.U.S.
The majority also notified the Presbytery of P.C.U.S.
of their action and the Minister wrote to the Presbytery re-»
linquishing his membership in the denomination.

I

might add here that all of these facts have been

stipulated.
The Presbytery appointed a commission# as it had a
right to do under its constitution# to investigate this situa­
tion,, which it did and the commission made three basic findings.
First,, it found and declared that those members of
the Vineville Presbyterian Church who held to their original
vows and did not renounce their affiliations with P.C.U.S.
were th® True Congregation of the Church.
Secondly# they withdrew all authority from the
Minister and officers who agreed to the statement of with­
drawal .
And finally# it found that the church session of the
Vineville Presbyterian Church was unable to act.

It did that

because that gave it the power to not only make these findings
but made certain further suggestions to the Presbytery.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Prettyman# assume that the resolution

had been adopted unanimously# the May resolution.

What is your

view as to what the status of the ownership of the church would

6
have been then?
MR* PRETTYMAN;

The unanimous vote in my view, Your

Honor, would have had no effect and it has been so held in
various state courts,
QUESTIONi

Who would have owned the church then?

MR. PRETTYMANs

Then under the Constitution it would

have reverted to the Presbytery itself.
QUESTION:

Mr. Prettyman, supposing that the Commis™

sion appointed by ~ was it the session you ware referring to —
made these three findings.
MR. PRETTYMAN;

That is the commission appointed by

the Presbytery.
QUESTION;

The Commission appointed by the Presby­

tery had a member who was financially interested in the out­
come of this particular dispute and the Booh of Order noneths—
less provided he was not disqualified but the State of Georgia
had a general nil© that in all voluntary associations it would
enforce their by-laws except requiring that any member to sit
in a private adjudication like tills should not have a financial
interest in the outcome.
Would you say the State of Georgia in a case, perhaps
involving the Elks Lodge, would ba prevented

from applying

that?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

The question ©f what happens when a

church ©omission acts improperly is one that is somewhat up

7
in •the air as a result of this Court's decision.

You recall

originally, back in Gonsalez, the rule was that if there was
fraud, collusion or arbitrariness that the Court could look
into it.
QUESTION?

That was not really my question,

I am

assuming that the church counsel acted entirely improperly un­
der the —
MR. PRETTYMAN:

I thought that you were suggesting

that somebody had a financial interest in tlie outcome.
QUESTION?

But I am also assuming that the Book of

Order says that is no problem.
MR. PRETTYMAN%

Well, if the Book of Order says that

is no problem, my own view is that a civil court cannot look
into that under the ruling in Serbian.
QUESTIONS

Even though with respect to all other

voluntary associations the state can apply its rule that says
\

no voluntary association can apply
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION3

,

that sort of rule:.

That is correct but I must >-

I gather, unless the situation falls with­

in the Ggnzalejs fraud or collusion.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Exactly.
1

QUESTIONS

Otherwise —

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Exactly®

That is what you said in

Serbian and you in effect eliminated the arbitrariness standard
and said that you could not go behind the church ruling but I

8
want to emphasise very stongly that that is not this case be­
cause here there has at no point been any challenge to the
commission's ruling and in fact I think your job is made much
easier by the fact that the Respondents have admitted that the
P.C.U.S„ does have authority to determine the true denomination
of the church.
QUESTION:

You are going to tell us what basis you

have for saying that fell© property follows the denomination, X
am sure.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Tell you what, Your Honor?

X am

sorry.
QUESTION:

What basis you have for saying the pro­

perty follows the true congregation.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes.

Well, that Ls based on the

Constitution of P.C.U.S. and the fact that it allows commis­
sions to be appointed to determine true denomination.
QUESTION:

Well, I know — true congregation — but

you determine who the true congregation is.

But why does that

determine the ownership of the property?
MR. PRETTYMA1I:

Everyone in this case agrees, Your

Honor, that the title to this property is in certain trustees
who hold it for the benefit of the church which is made up of
the congregation so that the congregation owns this property.
And —
QUESTION:

Well, do you think that —

9
MR. PRETTYMANs

— consequently the only question

is, who is the congregation?
QUESTION:

And why did the Supreme Court of Georgia

disagree, then?
MR. PRETTYMMT%

Well, the Supreme Court of Georgia,

quite frankly, misunderstood the argument in this case and 1
will be very candid, I think Respondents have, too.

The

Supreme Court of Georgia thought that this was -the Hull

case

and in Hull it was argued that there was an implied trust in
favor of the Mother Church, that the Mother Church was a party
in that case,
The Mother Church is not even a party in this case
although it has agreed to bs bound by the results and in that
case it was argued both in fehe Georgia courts and in.this
court that there was an implied trust in favor of the Mother
Church.

This Court ruled, as you will recall, that, /the prob­

lem with fehe implied trust was that it incorporated fcha dos.trine that you could not depart from, from church doctrine and
'Vi
struck that down.
'

:

’

When it went back to fehe Georgia courts they said,
"Well, if you are going to strike down part of our implied
trust wall strike it all out and there is no implied trust."
But. the courts below treated this case as if it was
an implied trust ©as®.

If you will look at the complaint, yon

will find nothing about an implied trust.

10
QUESTION:

May I get at something perhaps more

direct?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Sure.

What about the title documents?

MR. PRETTYMAN%
QUESTION:

The title document ~

Look at — may I just finish?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Sure.

Exhibit 6.

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Oh, excuse me.

Ufem ham.

Is that a sample of all 'the title docu-

. tents involved here?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

All of Idle title documents except

one place the property in the names cf trustees.
QUESTION:

Well, I am residing here, "Present trus­

tees for Vineville Presbyterian Church and -their successors
are not as such trustees.”
That is the way all of them read?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes, that is typically except on©.

■There is one that gave the church property directly to the
church.

How, that one gave the church property directly t©

the church but feh@ others all gave it to trustees and virtually
all cf them knew that the words
QUESTION:

Who were -they trustees for?

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

Do any ©f tha deeds say who the trustees

11
hold for?
MR. PRETTYM&Nx

Yes* the deeds say -- normally say,

"For the use, benefit and behoove of the Congregation."
Of the church which, of course ~
QUESTIONx

Of the church.

MR. PRETTYMANs

Of the church which, of course, is

the congregation.
QUESTIONx

Well, I do not understand the difference.

QUESTION:

I just wondered if the church would not

be deemed that group of people who within the corporation
manage to control it?
MR. PRETTYMANs

Well, under Section 2 3 of the Book

©f Church Order it reads, "The Visible Church Catholic includes
the local congregations or particular churches. This is in
accord with scriptural teachings.

In other words, it is a

part of the religious belief of this organ!nation as set forth
in its constitution that the congregations and churches are
an integral part of F.C.U.S. and that is what idle members vow
to, swear to when they become members of -the church, that they
will follow that.
QUESTIONS

Well, what if the state law simply said

that churches, in taking property, shall take the property in
the name of the religious corporation and that is the end of
it and whoever controls the religious corporation controls the
property.

Would you think that would be invalid?

12
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Wo, not necessarily because here

that would follow what happens here.
QUESTION:

The trustee

You have to put in some power in -the

Presbytery to overrule the rule of majority rule inside the
corporation.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, Your Honor, there are all kinds

©f — there ar© at least six different provisions in here that
in my judgment give the Presbytery power to say who the congre­
gation is.
QUESTION?

May X get back a moment to putting in my

question?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Sure.

There was a religious corporation organi­

sed there, was there not?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Yes, it was a corporation, that is

correct, corporation, organised in 1950.
QUESTION:

Now, it had a 35-year life.

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And that 35 years expired in, when was it,

19 — ?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, 1 forget -the date but there

was a lapse of years because the church did not realise that it
had a —
QUESTION:

And then, aa I understand it, -there was a

petition for reincorporation.

13
MR. PRETTYMANs
QUESTIONS

That is correct and that was granted.

And it was granted.

And that gave it

another 35 years.
MR. PRETTYMANs
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And that expired in 1970.

MR. PRETTYMANs

I

have done the question that the

church is presently incorporated, Your Honor.
QUESTION?

Well, that 1 cannot find in the record.

I was looking in the record for it.
MR. PRETTYMANs
QUESTIONS

Well, 1 cannot account for that.

My question was, who doss own the title

now if there is no longer a corporation?
MR. PRETTYMANs

Oh, I understand that under Georgia

law corporations are now perpetual.

That is the reason that

it was —■
QUESTIONS

Oh, I see, in term.
. V .

MR. PRETTYMANs

I have been advised of that by

Georgia counsel.
QUESTIONS

In the record it indicated it had a 35«

year life.
MR. PRETTYMANs

No, apparently they do not need to

keep reincorporating now and that is th© reason that the
church is presently considered incorporated.

And as a matter

of fact, the trial court so referred to it and the commission
and s© forth treated the court as an incorporated

court.

14
QUESTION?

Now, that petition for reincorporation

was a 1938 one, was it not?

But you are making a half of a neutral

document you say title is in the congregation.
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Neutral principles —

And then you just merely have to deter­

mine who the congregation is.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

That is the point.

Even if we were

to use neutral principles which we say you do not really get
to but even if you were to use them, all it does is get you
right back to the beginning again that this title is in the
local church which is made up of its congregation and there­
fore, who is the congregation?

And the church has properly

ruled on the question —
QUESTION:

You use the neutral principles that suit

you and the other ones you pick from a church law.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

&t all.

I do not us® any neutral principles

All I am saying is that if you use so-called 3neutral

principles,® under state law all you would get is a ruling
that ‘this particular church property belongs to the local church
or its congregation and that is
QUESTION:

all they will do for you.

Well, then, why did not the Supreme Court

of Georgia rule in your favor?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Because the Supreme Court of Georgia

17
thought that this eas© was the Hull case in which we were try­
ing to assart an implied trust in favor of the Mother Church
and it said* sines Hull there is no implied trust in Georgia
and consequently th© property is in the church but then it
went on to say without citing any reason for it at all,
"Composed of the majority" and that the majority could rule.
It did not give any reason for that.

It. did not

Presbytery has this power but we under the Supreme Court’s
cases are privileged to disregard that and just fe; apply socall©;! "neutral principles" you would say they were disentitled
•to do that.
MR. PRETTYMANs

Well, you ruled in Kedroffpand

Gomalea and Serbian and in all ©£ these cases that of course
they have t© follow that.

They have th© proper church ruling.

Let me show you where I think they went off, right

in th© beginning and if you look at Respondents9 brief I think
it is th© same thing.
What the trial court said was, P.C.U.S, had no au­
thority by resolution to constitute Plaintiffs as trustees or
as -the

True Congregation for th© purpose of creating a trust

10
relationship with respect to the church property of VFC when
none previously existed.
They thought this was an implied trust case and we
have never claimed an implied trust on behalf of the Mother
Church here.

What we have said is that we decided one question

and one question only that is pertinent and that is that the
True Congregation of this church is the minority and —

ginning if there were — if the vote had been unanimous I asked
you where would title be?
Mother Church.

You said it would have been in the

Is not that an implied trust theory?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

No, that is because of a particular

provision of what happened in the Book of Church Order,, Your
Honor.

In 6-3 you will find that there is — let me just read

it to you here —
”I£ a church is dissolved by the Presbytery or other­
wise ceases to exist and no disposition had been made of its
property» those who hold the title to the property shall —
This is» I am sorry» Joint Appendix 36.
" ~ shall deliver and convey and transfer to the
Presbytery™ so this would be by — I think under those circum­
stances, if you had a unanimous vote so that the entire congre­
gation walked out, in effect, the church would be standing
there ceasing to exist, certainly» as a congregation and I
think under 6-3 you could say that the church property would

19
revert to the Presbytery.
But here 1 do not think, you know, you have no such
problem because you did not have a majority vote and what they
found was, in effect, that the church does still cease to
exist.

Its Session cannot act but it does have a congregation

and the congregation is the minority.
Now, I must say in all candor, Mr. Justice Brennan,
that I think some of the confusion in this case has arisen
because of a misreading of your concurrence in —

You mean in Sharpsfcurg?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

In Sharpsburg.

make three points about that.

And I would like to

The misreading, of course, is

that you can pick neutral principles even in the face of a
direct court ruling on a subject.

You can just ignore the

court ruling and apply so-called ’’neutral principles."
In the first place, your language, carefully read,
simply does not say that.
Secondly, such a reading would be directly contrary
to what you wrote, Mr. Justice, in your concurrence in
Abington School District and?
Thirdly and finally, such a reading simply would fly
squarely in the face of this Court's rulings in other cases,
those before and sine® Sharpsburg.
Church
If the Mother Court has mad® a judgment and a civil
court ©an simply ignore it and decide th© ease on some general

20
principles of property law, that court has effectively overruled the Church and that is precisely what this Court has
repeatedly said that civil courts may not do.

We believe that

what you meant — and this is certainly the way I read your
language ~ is that absent a court ruling on the point in
issue — I mean,

church ruling on the point in issues, that

the state court is free to —
QUESTIONs

Assuming it is hierarchical.

MR. PRETTYMANs

Yes, assuming it is hierarchical and

there is no question here that this trial court held we are
hierarchical, that the state court can than turn to statutes
©r turn to neutral principles or whatever.

But as I have said,

neutral principles even if they crept into trie case in some
fashion, I do not think do Respondents any good because it
gets you back to the

basic question of who is the congregation

and whether you say that is a question of polity or church
administration or internal organization or church government
or internal discipline or faith or whatever, it cones within
what this Court in Watson, Kedroff and Serbian has said that
the Mother Church can decide for itself.
Those are the very roots of the Presbyterian struc­
ture and its faith because of the reasons that I have already
indicated.
Now, why do Respondents admit that we can determine
who the True Congregation is?

They say it is irrelevant

21
because Watson — the Watson rule is not applicable in Georgia.
Well, that cannot be.

The Watson rule, this Court

has said, is of constitutional dimensions, even though it was
not when it was originally decided and the Watson rule is very
simply that when you do have, in a hierarchical structure as
you have here, you have a proper, short church-court decision
on an issue, that the civil courts must give due deference to
it.

That is a constitutional rule.

Of course it is the rule

of Georgia.
QUESTIONj

Is it not a little more than deference?

MR. PRETTYMANs

Must absolutely abide by it.

I

U3©d "deference51 —
QUESTIONs

That is not deference.

MR. PRETTYMAN s

You are absolutely right.

I think

it has been referred to, Your Honor, as the deference rule.
That is the reason I say that but of course it is more than
deference.

It is absolutely binding.
We think this case is like you said in -~
QUESTION?

Now, where did you find in Dharpsburg

the suggestion that it is only where there is not any churchcourt decision ~
MR. PRETTYMMfs

Because you said, after you referred

to neutral principles, you then said, "Again, however, general
principles of property law may not be relied upon if their
application requires civil courts to resolve doctrinal issues."

22

And that is what yon would do hare.

You would have

to have a civil court saying, oh, no, we override this resolu­
tion of this proper church body and say that that is not the
True Congregation.
And when yon referred to statute you said, 85In a
manner that precludes stats interference in doctrines such
statutes must be carefully drawn to leave control of ecclesias­
tical polity as well as doctrine to church governing bodies.53
S© in each instance it seems to me you said, in
effect, you can use these neutral principles and so forth only
if it does not involve you in church polity

as you are immed­

iately involved in here if you try to apply them.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK C. JONES, ESQ.,
ON' BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. JONESs
Courts

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please the

26
This is a church property dispute that involves real
property in Macon, Georgia.

The courts of Georgia simply

applied neutral principles of law in ruling that the Respon­
dents and not the Petitioners hold title and ware entitled to
prevail.

It is not a religious controversy.
Mo question of religious doctrine or practice or

polity was raised by the pleadings or was considered or de­
cided by the trial court or the Supreme Court of Georgia.
The decision of the Supreme Court is in full accor­
dance with this Court9a decisions in Hull, Sharpsburq' and
Serbian and with an earlier decision of the Supreme Court of
Georgia, which was not even cited in the Petitioner’s brief,
Carnas versus Smith, that X will refer to in just a moment.
QUESTION?

Mr. Jones, when you refer to Carnes,

that involved the Methodist Church.
MR. JONESs
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor.
Why do you think there is an ftmious brief

here by the appropriate body ©f the? Methodist Church opposing

your position?
MR. JONESt

Your Honor, I find that somewhat diffi­

cult to understand and I would like t© answer it in this way,
if I may,

Caynaa versus foyftb. was decided in IP?? by the

Georgia Supreme Court and as you have observed, it involved the
United Methodist Church.

That case ruled for the denomination,

applying neuferal principles ©f law.

27
The Georgia Court simply looked to the Soak of
Discipline# which is tlie Methodist counterpart of the Book off
Church Order and found clear-cut provisions saying that local
church property in the United Methodist. Church is held in trust
for the use of the Ministry and the members of the church and
based upon the application of neutral principles in Carnes
versus Smith, just as the Maryland Court of Appeals had done
in Sharpsburg t it was held that the denomination was entitled
to prevail.®
1 cannot answer the question other than to speculate
that perhaps the position being urged by Petitioners hare
would go even farther than that and would accomplish what
would amount» as I would tern it, to a ICO per cent deference
rule and would say that in all eventst neutral principles
cannot be applied if any body of the church; regardless of
what is in the Book of Discipline or the Book of Church Order
had issued a ruling; a judgment or an order as existed here®
QUESTIONS

Well; do you believe that a property is

held' for the benefit of the congregation?
MR. JONESs

NO; sir.

This case, YOur Honor —

What if you did?

Than would Mr. Prettyman*s

result follow or not?
MR. JONESs

or not?
MR. JONESs

Your Honor, 1 disagree with the conclu­

sion reached by Mr. Prefctyman.
QUESTION:

I know but assume that the property were

held for the congregation.
MR. JONES:

Would his result follow?

No, sir.

Immediately prior to May of

1973 the property was held in the name of a corporation.
Under the Book of Church Order, trustees of that corporation
acted and were appointed.

Under the Book of Church Order,

the majority of the congregation was entitled to control the
property*
As I will point out in a little more detail later,
the Book of Church Order is absolutely explicit in making it
clear that there is no right whatever in the Presbytery,

a

Session, in the Synod or in the General Assembly or In any
commission or committee of the church to have anything to do
with local church property.
To -the contrary, in Sections €.1 and 6.2 of- the
Book of Church Order, which deal with local church property,
it is expressly —

MR. JONES:
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Yes, sir.
And is that the way the others read, too?
It is typical.

There is one deed that

goes to the corporation itself. Your Honor.
QUESTION:
©n these deeds

Now, the Supreme Court of Georgia relied

30
MR. JONES:
QUESTIONS
MR. JONESs

Yes, sir.
And then what next?
They relied on four things, Your Honor.

They relied first of all on the deeds to the property.

They

relied next on the corporate charter which provided that only
the local church would have the right to control the local
church property.
They next looked at some state statutes and concluded
that those statutas did not. in and ever themselves

give any

rights to the denominations and finally, they looked fc© the
Book of Church Order itself.
QUESTIONS

Now, was there any definition of local

church in any of ‘these papers?
MR.. JONESs

Yes, sir, either the trustees of the

local church or the corporation itself was the local church.
The point that I would make that radically differs
from Mr. Prettyman, there is no question but that the title
was in the local congregation immediately prior to th® date in
May of 1973 when the controversy arose but on that date by a
vote of approximately two to one, the Respondents in

this case

voted to withdraw from th© denomination and to control their
property independently ©f th© denomination.
They did this ©n th© basis of these provisions in
the Bcspk oS Church Order.
QUESTION:

Now, before you get to that ~~

That is all right.

I think it is a terribly important

QUESTION:
ME. JONES:

Go ahead.

I would think it is.

First of all, the Book of Church Order

itself in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, one deals with an unincorpora­
ted church, the other with an incorporated church.

In each

instance it provides that the local congregation solely shall
have the right to buy, sell, own, dispose, hold, or otherwise
deal with real 'property.
There is no accountability by the local congregation
to any higher body.

No, it is the local — if, under the law

determine and find what or who is the local congregation.
MR. JONESi

Well, YCur Honor, this is a typical local

church property dispute where there are two factions and the
question is, does this faction or that faction have title to
the property under the mutual principles o

trine?

MR. JOKES2
QUESTIONS
MR. JONESs

Your Honor, raay X answer it two ways?
Well, yes.
I would respectfully say that is not the

issue but X would like to give a full answer to it.

X think

the issue in this ease is, which faction of the church is
entitled tinder the formal title doctrine, the neutral princi­
ples of law approach, to hold the title?
But secondly in any event, if it be viewed as it has
been stated in that question, nevertheless, we look to the
Book ofChurch Order as it existed in May of 1973 to determine
how th© local congregation acts, how it determines what happens
to property and that is the point I was about t© address a
moment ago.
The Book of Church Order says that the local congre­
gation itself is ‘the sol® and exclusive body or group that
has the right to say what happens to real property and secondly
says 'that th® local congregation act by majority vote which is
nhat happened in this instance.
Now, this administrative commission that was appointed
is not th© party, pursuant to any provision in the Book of
Church Order,which gives authority to a Presbytery, a Synod,
th© General Assembly, a Commission or a Committee any right to
review or to consider a local church property dispute.
QUESTIONS

The Presbytery’ thought otherwise, did it

35
not?
MR. JONES: They are contending otherwise obviously,
Your Honor.
QUESTION:

So they disagree with you on the reading

©f the book?
MR,. JONES:

Your Honor, no citation appears to the

Book o£ Church Order that gives any such authority.
fch® contention is being made.

Obviously,

And there is another point 1

would make in this connection that I think is extremely iraportent.
Th© Petitioner's reply brief at pages S to 0, it
seems t© us, recognizing that there simply is an absence of
any provision in the Book of Church Order that authorizes
the administrative commission to exercise jurisdiction or t©
give power to anyone other than the local congregation as to
local church property, quotes from a so-called "ruling of the
general assembly of the Presbyterian Church ~-B
QUESTIONs

;\

What page is that?
...i

MR. JONES:

At pages — beginning dc page 6, Your

Honor, ©f the Petitioner’s reply brief.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Y@s, thank you.
I would Xik© to make three points about

that as to why I think they should be totally disregarded.
First @1% the so-called “ruling89 which begins to b®
quoted at pag© 6 is not in the record in this case.

That is a

36
quotation from an Amicus brief that was filed by the denomina”
tion and idle denomination itself quoted some things which are
not a part of the record in this case.
The second point is that it is contrary to tsh© sti­
pulation

of the parties.

There is a stipulation in this case

which appears at page 316 of the Appendix which provides that
this case will be decided on the basis ©f the pleadings, the
stipulation of the parties and the exhibits to the pleadings
and to the stipulations.
The Book of Church Order as it assisted in its entir­
ety in 1973 when this controversy arose is a part of the
Appendix.

The ruling which is referred to beginning at page 6

of Petitioner's reply brief is not in the Book of Church Order,
is not in fch® Appendix, is not in the record and is contrary
to the stipulation.
And third and finally, in any event, even if the socalled ruling had been in the record it is not a part ©f the
Book of Church Order which I think is of fundamental impor­
tance.

The Book of Church Order can only be amended or changed

by a three-step process.
First of all, there must be the adoption of a pro­
posed amendment by the General Assembly, the highest body ©f
the Presbyterian Church.
Secondly, that mat be recommended to the Presbytery
as

of which there are 72, I believe and must be consented to

37
by at least a majority of them.
And third and finally* the General Assembly* follow”
ing consent by the Presbyteries* must then adopt and approve
again.
None of that has been done as to any ruling* rule*
opinions, anything of that kind which is cited for the first
time in this case in the reply brief of Petitioners and wa
would respectfully ask that that be disregarded by this Court.
It is not in the record.
pulation.

It is contrary to the sti­

It is not in the Book of Church Order.
QUESTIONs

What if tee Book of Order provided, just

as it did with respect amendments to the Book of Order but had
Tfe.tr-ng--.-aaa

i.-«r..wrt

an additional provision that only a session of the 'General
Assembly shall be entitled to question the validity of an
amendment that is adopted?
MR. JONESs

Your Honor, 3! suppose there would simply

be a different amending process.

The' point is that no amen­

ding process was followed, whatever it might be in this case*
Perhaps 2 misunderstood the thrust of the''question?
QUESTIONg

Well, can a denomination prescribe a

method for amending its fundamental

charter which in this case

I take it is th© Book of Order and say that challenges to tea
method by which the particular amendment was adopted may only
h% raised in the canonical church o.r before the canonical

session?

38
MR. JOKES:

Probably so.

1 think that that would

be a matter of church government or policy.

In any event,

that issue is not in this case because it is not contended that
there has been any amendment to the Book of Church Order that
incorporates the ruling or any of the other matters that are
referred to begimiing at page 6 of Petitioners' brief.
QUESTION:
your argument.

Mr. Jones, I want to be sure I understand

And is it that we cannot consider in this case

the fact that the Presbytery made a final decision that the
Petitioners were the True Congregation?
MR. JONES?

Your Honor, we do not question the right

of the Presbytery to decide ~
QUESTIONS No, no, now, perhaps I did not state my
question very well.

May we consider, in this case, the fact —

and 1 gather it is a fact «°” that the Presbytery, which is a
church court, made a final decision in favor of the Petitioners?
MR. JONES?
QUESTION?
we may not

Your Honor, that may be considered -And since that is not in the stipulation,

consider it in this case.

MR. JONES?

Ho, sir, the administrative commission

ruling is in the record of the case.

There is no question of

that and 1 did not mean to suggest otherwise.
What I am saying is that the so-called ruling which
has nothing to do with this case — it is an interpretation of
the Book of Church Order or it is a proposed amendment to the

39

Book of Church Order that appears at page 6 ~ never mater­
ialised into the form of an amendment.

It never bee cane a part

of the Book of Church Order.
QUESTION:

But it is the kind of a tiling that the

commission was carrying out.
MR. JONES:

No, sir, the commission did not propose

to act pursuant to what is quoted at page 6.
QUESTION:

But do you say that it was powerless to

do what it purported to do?
MR. JONES:

Your Honor, we say that it had full

power to do everything that it

did except for the final act.

There is no question but that the commission, the Presbytery
which appointed it has the power to make determinations of
that membership and about faith and about doctrine and matters
of —
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

And as to who the True Congregation is?
They have the right to decide for them­

selves who will be recognised by the denomination as the
loyal or true members of the denomination and there is no
question as to that.

There has never been a question in this

case but when the commission tries to go one step farther and
to declare as they did that property rights are forfeited,
that is the last sentence that appears in this commission
finding.

They cite no basis in the Book of Church Order for

attempted forfeiture of property rights

40
It then becomes proper and appropriate under the
application

of th© Mutual Principles Doctrine for a civil

court to look at least superficially or in a beginning manner
at the Book of Church Order and see is there anything, is there
anything in the Book of Church Order that says that anybody
other than the local congregation has the right to do anything
with respect to local church property.
QUESTIONS

We just skipped over the point that we

have been at several times here.

If the commission has the

authority to determine who is the congregation and it deter­
mined who is the congregation, then the only question left is,
was the property really being held for the congregation or was
it not?
If it was ~ which I thought you said it was — why
should not the congregation as determined by the hierarchy
■.?

.

have the property?
MR. JONESs

Your Honor, I do not mean to be evasive.

I am attempting to answer it.

We have a fundamental difference

as to5 the issue in the case, obviously.
The determination by the commission was four months!
after the controversy had arose and the vote had been taken.
QUESTION:

It is always going to be after the event,

is it not, as a lawsuit is always subsequent to the controversy
as well as to the injury.
MR. JONESs

Yes.

But the question is, what were the

41
relative rights of the denomination on the one hand and the
local congregation which was authorised to act by majority
vote on the other on the date on which the vote was taken?
And according to the Book of Church Order t the local
congregation was congregational.

It was not hierarchicalf

with respect to the us® and disposition of local church pro­
perty on the date that the majority vote was taken.
QUESTIONS

Obviously, the Presbytery and the commis­

sion read the church book differently than you do in terras of
that last step that you were talking about.

They think that,

property follows the congregation under the church law.
MR. JONESs

No, sir, I think the sole basis for the

claim that is made by the Petitioners, at least in the trial
court, is the ruling of the administrative commission.

Nothing

was pointed to elsewhere in the Book of Church Order that
would justify any claim by the denomination.
Absent -the action of the administrative commission,
this would b® like any other voluntary association which by
majority vote had voted two to one
be used in a certain way.

claim is that an administrative commission was appointed and

The

commission simply issued an edict and they said that the pro­
perty rights of the majority of the members of the local con­
gregation ara hereby forfeited.

They cited no provision in

43
the Book of Church Order that authorized such action.
QUESTION:

Mr, Jones, just before the resolution was

adopted, is it correct that the property was owned for the
benefit of the congregation?
MR. JONES:

Yes, sir, by trustees and

some of the

congregation.

MR. JONESs

QUESTION :

At sortie point in time did the property

cease to be owned for the benefit of the congregation?
MR. JONES:

Yes, sir, the moment that the vote was

taken two to one and two factions were created, then by virtue

Maybe you did not. mean it but you say it.
4.i

MR. JONES:
it

in those words.

X clo not think we answered it, we stated
What we, X believe, said and certainly

intended to say is that the denomination has the' unquestioned
right to determine for itself who it will recognise as being
true ©r loyal members in the denomination’s eyes.
We have never acknowledged that 'the denomination
had siny night whatever with respect to local church property.
If I may answer these several questions a little
more fundamentally, to go back --

45
QUESTION;

Would you tell me before you are through

what you understand the issue to be?
MR. JONESs

Yes, I understand this to be the issues

In a state such as Georgia that has adopted the neutral pr,insi­
pies approach which is one of the three approaches that this
Court has recognized as being constitutionally permissible,
where the neutral principles approach is applied by looking
simply at deeds, state statutes, the corporate charter of the
local church and the applicable provisions of the denomination's
government and where, by using neutral principles it found
that title is in the majority that voted to withdraw as a re­
sult of the resolution of withdrawal»

And no religious ques­

tion is involved»
Nevertheless, is it requisite that a civil court
defer to an e« part® administrative commission which is appoin­
ted by the denomination and which issues an ess parte finding
or declaration that the property rights of the majority are
forfeited under those circumstances.
Now, if I may go back more fundamentally, this case
is absolutely identical with what the Maryland Court of Appeals
did in the Sharpsbmrg situation.

Your Honors will recall that

that ©ase first cam® up and was then remanded in the - light of
gall for farther consideration in the light of what was held
in that eeisso

M

The Maryland Court of Appeals then wrote a second

46
opinion in which they reviewed in great detail what had been
done earlier.

In short, four things were done.

First of all, they looked at the deeds.

The deeds

ware identical in result to the deeds t© the Georgia property
in this case.
Secondly, they looked at the local corporation
charter which, as here, provided that title was held by the
local congregation and it had the right to buy, sell and so
forth the property.
Third, they looked at state statutes which just as
here, did net give any rights to the denomination and,
Finally, they looked to the Book of Church Government
of the Church of God and just as here, just as the Book of
Church Order, they found nothing that gave any rights other
than to the local congregation.
So applying the neutral principles of law which this
court has recognised can be applied if it does not involve
going into questions of doctrine in Hull, again using one of
the three constifeutionally-permlssible methods that Mr. Justice
Brennan singled out in his concurring opinion in Sharpsburg
and which this Court unanimously in Sharpsburg upheld in the
case of the Maryland situation and again, following the mutual
principles —
QUESTION;
MR. JONES:

What church was that in Sharpsburg?
Church of God.

47
QUESTIONS

And. was there not a determination first

that that was not a hierarchy for the church, that i.t was a
Congregational Church and was not that an absolute key to the
decision in that case?
MR. JONESs

I would respectfully say no, Your Honor.

There is a statement that it is not totally hierarchical but
there is also a statement that it is primarily Presbyterial in
nature which is one of the forms of hierarchical churches.
The significance, I would submit, is that it was
found in the Church of God case that as to local property that
it was indeed congregational, that is, that it was not hier­
archical as to that matter.
QUESTION s

And that was quite essential to the

decision in that case.
MR. JONESs

A very important fact, yes, sir.

And I

would call attention to footnote 8 in the Petitioner9s reply
brief in which it is acknowledged in this case that even in a
hierarchical church the Book of Church ..Government says that as
to certain matters that it

is not hierarchical, then that re­

sult, of course, obtains.
Well, that is precisely what the Book _pf Church
Order does ia th© present case as to local church property.
says the local church property shall be subject to the sol©
and exclusive power ©f the local congregation and 'that is
identical to the Church ©£ tod situation.

It

48
It meant in short that neither the Presbytery, the
Synod nor the General Assembly nor any commission nor committee
of any of them had any claim of any kind to local church pro­
perty,
I would say in conclusion, may it please the Court,
that we feel that this is simply a local church property disputs in which the neutral principles of law doctrine has been
properly applied by the Supreme Court of Georgia whereas in
Carnes versus Smith the denomination prevailed because it had
in its disciple appropriate provisions with respect to local
church property.
In this case the denomination did not prevail be­
cause of a complete absence of any right or power in anyone
other than the local congregation with respect to local
church property.
QUESTIONS

But. you still say in your own church

papers that the local congregation is the Petitioners.
MR. JONES:

No, sir, the minority of the local con­

gregation are the Petitioners, YOur Honor.
QUESTION2

And did you not say, repeatedly, that

there is the congregation?
MR. JONES:

No, sir.

If I said so I retract that

statement.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

You said so in footnote 9 in your brief.
I am afraid my time is running out.

49
What we have sought to say — and I would clarify it
if we have created the contrary impression — is that we
recognise that on matters of faith and membership B there is no
question but the denomination has a right to recognize whoever
it sees fit for its purposes to recognize but we have never
acknowledged that as far as property rights are concerned —
QUESTION:

But is it not perfectly clear that the

purpose for which they adopted this or made this decision was
for the purpose of trying to decide who owned the property?
That is the only reason they got involved in this, is it not?
MR. JONESs
that was sought.

That obviously was the ultimate result,

There is no question of that but nothing,

Your Honor, was cited as a basis for such a finding in the
Book of Church Order itself and we have never acknowledged -QUESTION %

If I read your brief correctly you did

not challenge anything in their findings except the ultimate
conclusion that the ownership followed the congregation.
MR. JONES:

Your Honor, it is difficult for me to

reply to that in the time that remains other than to say that
our positiont we believe*has consistently been that the Peti­
tioners represent only the minority of the local congregation
and the denomination has only the right to recognize the
minority as being true as far as membership is concerned but
not with respect to property rights.
Property rights are determined by what was in the

50
Book of Church Order on the data that the schism took place
end on that date the Book of Church Order said that by majority
vote the local congregation had the right to withdraw from the
congregation and to hold its property independently of the
denomination.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.
MR. PRETTYMAMs

Do I have enough time to make my

rebuttal argument?
MR CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

You have three minutes and

that will take you one minute overtime.
MR. PRBTTYMAN:
opponent has

First, my

said that there is no question of religion

raised by the pleadings.
• \

Thank you very much.

I would simply call your attention
' JfirJ-* vi.-v

to til© complaint which was based squarely, totally, completely
on this church ruling as to who the congregation was.
Secondly, I agree with the thrust of same of the
questions that we really probably should not even be .arguing
about an interpretation of the Book, of Church Order.

That is

not for us to do but at least to give you some comfort, I would
impose upon you to make & note, if you would, of three sections,
114, 16". and 19—3 which clearly show that even as to property
the Presbytery and each ascending judicator has not only a
right but the duty every year to review the acts of the next
lower court and to change anyone, anyone of any nature that
goes, among other things, against the best interests of the

51
Mother Church and finally —
QUESTION:

Mr. Prettyraan, would you not agree that

on the date they adopted the resolution that the majority of
the congregation could have conveyed good title to this proparty without the consent of the people in the central church?
MR, PRETTYM&N:

I agree that they could have sold it

but the money would have been held in trust for the congrega™
tion of the church as determined by the Mother Church when the
Mother Church reviewed that action.
I doubt if they could have gotten title back because
you have a third innocent party but there is no qu@sti.on but
that the money would have been held subject to review and when
the Presbytery came around if they said that that property
should not have been sold, that was not in the- best interests
of the church, they could have said where that money should
have gone.
My last point is in regard to Sharpsburg, it is very
interesting that Maryland at that time had a statute — you
remember -that was a congregational case but Maryland had a
statute which said, "Such Presbyterian churches —" and we are
now referring to the Presbyterian Church of the United States ~
raay fee incorporated only in conformity with the provisions of
the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in the United
States of Mierica.”
In other words, Maryland recognised in the Sharpsburg

52
situation that you had a different situation from the Church
of God than you did in the Presbyterian Church, which was
hierarchical in nature.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

the case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3s02 o'clock p.m. the case was
submitted„3
