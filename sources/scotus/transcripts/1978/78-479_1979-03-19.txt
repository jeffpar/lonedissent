M.Ro CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-479* Edmonds against Compagnie Generale Transatlantique.
Mr. Breit* you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CALVIN W. BREIT* ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BREIT:

Mr. Chief Justice* may it please the

Court:
This matter comes on out of the Fourth Circuit*
arising out of a decision which was then in conflict with
the Ninth and now with the Second and Fifth Circuits* as well*
concerning the rights of a longshoreman who was injured aboard
the Defendant's vessel* as a result of the combined negligence
of the longshoreman himself* the stevedore and the ship owner.
The major issue before the Court is whether or not
the longshoreman has a right to recover in full his damages
under the long-established common law principle of joint and
several liability from the various tort-feasors who caused his
harm* or whether that right has been abrogated by statute* under
the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers! Compensation Act.
The history of the right In both maritime and land
based law is extensive.

The Court has ruled in Halcyon v.

Haenn* it has ruled in Pope and Talbot v, Hawn* it has more
recently ruled in Cooper v, Kopke* In ACL v, Brie* and numerous

4
other cases, that the injured party has an indivisible right
of recovery in full.
The question now posed is whether Congress intended
x-

■

to abrogate that rule when it amended the Longshoremen and
Harbor Workers* Compensation Act in 1972.

Prior to 1972. it

was clear that Halcyon v, Hasnn, Pope and Talbot v. Hawn was
the law on that particular issue.

Congress made no Act which

would suggest that it intended to change that law.
There is an apparent, but not actual, discrepancy
between two sentences in 905(b) of the Act, which has been
taken to suggest that the Congress was intending proportionate
fault.
Nothing could have been further from Congress 1 mind
at the time.

Respondent, in page 11 of his brief, concedes

that the purpose of the second sentence of 905(b) was intended
to preserve the doctrine established by this Court in Reed vl
Yaka, namely that a ship owner could not, by hiring his own

|

longshoremen and thus become the stevedore, avoid the ham that
'

i

i

he does to that stevedore.

^

It was in the context of Reed v. Yaka, that the
second sentence was passed in the ‘72 Amendments.

\

And the

I
purpose of it was solely to retain the doctrine as espoused by
this Court in Read va Yaka.
On pages 43 and 44 of Respondent's brief, it is aug~
gesfeed that 2)33 of this same Act was passed so that the

i

longshoremen could not effect a double recovery and receive
double compensation.
Well., it is inconceivable that he could have re­
ceived double compensation* unless in the first instance he is
compensated in full by the ship owner* tort-feasor* who has
caused his ham.
Napoli in the Second Circuit* Anderson v«, Iceland
in the First* both have stated that the purpose of that sentence in 905(b) was to preserve the doctrine of Heed v. Yaka,
But, more important than that, Congress- itself wa'^v
not silent on the point.

Congress specifically stated that

the longshoremen's right of action in negligence against the
ship owner "shall survive,"

That right of action against the

ship owner is the right to recover 100$ of his damages from
the ship owner or any other person who independently or con­
currently created the harm that he has suffered.
The congressional record is replete with dozens of
cases that it intended to overrule that were in existence at
the time.
This Court, in an active role — which it is per­
mitted to do in matters maritime -- under the doctrine of
Seas Shipping v. Sleracki, provided for the longshoremen a
cause of action which created in effect an absolute right of
recovery for any unseaworthy condition, regardless of fault.

Interestingly enough, the unseaworthy condition was

6
almost always caused by the negligence of the stevedore.
The Court had held in Halcyon v. Haenn that there was no
cause of action over against the stevedore for contribution in
tort»

And this Court then went on to extend the seas doctrine*

under a contract theory* when in Ryan it held that there is,
not contribution* but indemnity,
. The Congress spent a great deal of time on those
issues* and in doing so in its reports it clearly established
what it was intending to do.

It set forth specifically the

names of the cases that it intended to overrule.

Particularly*

under the Section of Elimination of Unseaworthiness Remedy* it
cites Seas Shipping v« Slerackl as one of the cases it intended
to overrule.
No longer does the longshoreman have a cause of
action merely because he was injured and merely because there
was a defective condition.

He now is reduced to the common

law negligence action* Instead of an action under unseaworfchi=
ness.
The Congress went on further to suggest "further*"
and then reciting Ryan Stevedoring v. Pan Atlantic*"the thirdparty action* the triparte cause of litigation* which had
burdened the courts and had expended large suras of money by
the stevedore and his carrier and the ship owner alike* is
better put to use paying compensation."
And so* Ryan was specifically overruled.

Cromlty

7
Algonnes, Italia Soclete v. Oregon Stevedoring, all cases which
had established the cause of action for unseaworthiness were
specifically overruled.

And finally, under the same suggestion,

the elimination of unseaworthiness remedy, we finally come to
the sentence which is the crux of this case,"the vessel will
not be chargeable with the negligence of the stevedore or em­
ployees of the stevedore."
Respondent and the Fourth Circuit, I suggest,
erroneously have interpreted that statement to mean that a'
percentage of negligence requires only a percentage of payment.
When, in fact, what was intended hers by the vessel not being
chargeable with the negligence of the stevedore, was to do
away with Seas Shipping, which said that in effect the ship
owner is vicariously responsible for the acts of the stevedore,
and thus becomes liable when the stevedore commits an act of
negligence.
Today, under the Amendments, the act of negligence
must be committed by the ship owner, himself.

But that does

not mean that there cannot be more than one approximate cause
of an injury.

And nowhere- was it intended by Congress that the

ship owner would become liable in tort if it were the sole
and exclusive tort-feasor. To suggest that is to defeat the
purpose of the Act, and as Congress has said to cause the ship
owner to remain responsible to his obligations in tort to the
injured longshoremen.

8
QUESTION:

Mr. Brelt, supposing this case had arisen

in just a common law tort situation, and the trial court had
mistakenly submitted interrogatories regarding comparative
fault to the jury, and they had found 20$ on one party, 70$ on
the other.

The highest court in the state says the trial court

was wrong, "We don't have comparative fault here, we just have
traditional, ordinary negligence."
Could it uphold a verdict against the 20$ liable
party for the entire amount?
MR. BRBXT:

If we are talking about comparative

fault of others besides the injured pei^son, clearly, under
every case that has ever been decided, it must give that in­
jured person 100$ of the recovery, with the exception of those
states which have incorporated it into a statute, under the
doctrine of comparative negligence, under the common law doc­
trine of ordinary negligence, both land and maritime, the
injured person always was entitled to the whole<> because his
harm Is indivisible, even though two or three or four may have
contributed to the cause.

The broken leg is the broken leg,

and if three people concurrently aided in breaking it, he still
has one harm.
And so, my answer to you, sir, is that every case
has always held that the Injured party is entitled to the full
recovery, at common law.
QUESTION:

I get the feeling that in most of these

9
maritime cases there is one insurance man that pays it all,
so why do they have all this litigation?

Doesn't Lloyd pay

it anyway?
MR» BREXT:

Mr» Justice Marshall, I have argued in

my brief that the ultimate economic loss is going to be shared
between the stevedore and the ship owner, somehow or other,
in any event, that the sole purpose that we are here is be­
cause they are both in concert suggesting that the injured
person suffer the economic loss, and he is the least able to
bear that loss»
You are correct, sir, that regardless of this
Court's ruling, provided it gives the injured longshoreman
his full recovery, sooner or later, in the course of dealing
between the stevedore and the ship owner, the cost will be
passed on to the ship owner and the ultimate consumere

There

is no question about that.
The issue then is do we take it away from the in­
jured party, so that their respective losses are less?

Common

law doesn't permit that.
QUESTION:

Your submission, Mr. Breit, aa I under­

stand it, is that the statutory language in question was in­
tended to do no more than to preserve the rule of Reed v. Yaka?
MR. BREIT:

Yes, sir.

That's correct, preserve the

rule of — the conflict in the statutory language.

The second

sentence was intended solely to do away with Reed v, Yaka.

The

10

issue of the vessel not being chargeable with the negligence
of the stevedore referred to the unseaworthiness vicarious
liability, which had come as a result of Seas Shipping v.
Sieracki«
QUESTION:

Would you state it for me again0

Did

you say it was to preserve or to overrule Reed v, Yaka?
MRo BREIT:

To preserve — Well* let me modify that.

Reed v„ Yaka had two rules.

One rule was that the ship owner,

who is a stevedore -■= is his own stevedore -- is responsible»
as a ship owner.

That rule was intended to be preserved,

QUESTION:

There the stevedore was the bear boat

charterer, I think.
MR. BREIT:

Yes.

And the second portion of Reed v, Yaka which followed
Seas Shipping, which said that unseaworthiness is a cause of
action.

That was intended to be overruled.

So, really, they

were modifying Reed v0 Yaka, but retaining the portion which
said, "If you are a ship owner and a stevedore at the same
'time, you are responsible as a ship owner, not as a stevedore,"
QUESTION:
MR. BREIT:

For unseaworthiness?
No, sir.

Only for negligence as a ship

owner.
QUESTION:
MR. BREIT:

But wasn't Reed an unseaworthiness case?
Reed v. Yaka was an unseaworthiness case.

and Reed v. Yaka was the case which held that the ship owner

11

could not abort the law by hiring his own longshoremen.

It

held that If he were a stevedore and a ship owner he x^as re~
sponsible as a ship owner.
QUESTION:
MR. BREIT:

For unseaworthiness?
For unseaworthiness or for negligence*

certainly.
QUESTION:

The thing that puzzled me -- I didn't

understand the case to decide any negligence issue.
MRo BREIT:
QUESTION:

Read v. Yaka did not.
But it held that when a stevedore was

both stevedore and ship owner you could sue him as ship owner*
despite the then statute.
MR. BREIT:

That was the holding* and that was the

QUESTION:

And whether his liability depended upon

purpose —

unseaworthiness or negligence was really not the issue in the
Yaka case* although it was an unseaworthiness claim.,

Now*

that unseaworthiness has now been eliminated by Congress* but
your contention at least is that this statutory language at
issue in this case was to preserve the rule of Reed v. Yaka*
the fundamental rule that when a person is both stevedore and
ship owner he can be sued as ship owner?
MR. BREIT:

Yes* sir.

And I think every court of

appeals that has ruled on that point has so held.

The Fourth

Circuit did not touch the point in its argument and concluded

12

that the only way you could reconcile the two sentences was to
come up with a rule of proportionate fault.

A rule of pro­

portionate fault, as between tort-feasors, is really not a rule
at all as to the injured person.

Proportionate fault should

speak to the degree of liability as between the tort-feasors.
QUESTION:

And you concede that the damages should

be reduced by the percentage of the Plaintiff's fault, do you
not?
MR. BREIT:

Yes, sir, that's specifically within the

statute.
QUESTION:
MR. BREIT:

That's not at issue here?
That is not at issue here.

We concede

— There was a $100,000 verdict here, we concede that 10$ of
that is a reduction as a result of the longshoreman's own fault.
QUESTION:

I hate to reveal my stupidity so frequently,

but the second sentence is what's critical here — It's a
critical part of your argument, as I understand it.
want to be sure I do catch it.

And I just

Because the sentence says, "If

such person was employed by the vessel to provide stevedoring
service, no such action shall be permitted if the injury," and
so forth.
And you are saying it was to preserve the action,
rather than to prevent it.
MR. BREIT:

It is to preserve the action against the

ship owner who was likewise a stevedore.

13

QUESTION:
mitted against him.

But It says no such action shall be per­
That's why 1 am so puzzled®

Maybe I am

reading the wrong sentence.
QUESTION: "If such person was employed by the vessel."
MR. BREIT:

To provide stevedoring services. "No

such action shall be permitted if the injury was caused by
the negligence- of persons engaged in providing stevedoring
services."
What they were saying is that the ship owner* as a
ship owner* remains liable.

As a stevedore he does not.

He's

4!

got two heads at that moment.
If it is the stevedoring services that are the sole
cause of this man's injury* or that creates an unsea worthy
condition aboard that vessel* then there is no right of re­
covery.

But if the ship owner* as a ship owner -- for instance*

bringing in grease and oil from another port and leaving it on
the deck, or having a defenctive winch* which was not part of
its stevedoring operation* he remains liable.
QUESTION:

But you construe that sentence as pri­

marily preserving a claim* rather than destroying a claim?
MR. BREIT:
QUESTION:
MR. BREIT:
QUESTION:

Preserving Reed v„ Yaka„
I understand.

Okay.

The Committee Reports have said so.
It's? a very odd way of doing it* isn't it?

You would grant at least that ites inartfully drafted* I suppose.

14
MR. BRE1T:
sir.

Oh, I think it's very poorly drafted, yes,

I think it was just a very simple matter for them to put

in proportionate fault if they had intended.

And if they had

intended it by these sentences, it is grossly inarfcfully drafted.
But I don’t think that was the intent of Congress, because at
the. time proportionate fault was not a doctrine known in mari­
time law.

At the time, in

’72, when these Amendments were

passed and before this Court had ruled in Reliable, the only
proportionate fault that ever existed was the old fifty-fifty
rule, which later this Court amended.

But, of course, when

the Court acted in Reliable, it did so changing a common law
doctrine, and not a matter that had been heavily debated by
the Congress.
QUESTION:
MR. BREIT:
QUESTION:
example.

An admiralty law doctrine, not common law.
Yes, admiralty law.
May I ask one more question about this

Say the Plaintiff is an employee of the ship owner

performing stevedoring services.

And he wants to sue the

ship owner for negligence unrelated to the stevedoring services.
You say he can or he cannot?
MR. BREIT:

He can, under Reed v. Yaka, and he can

under this preservation and the amendment.
QUESTION:

Even though he is an employee, he may

sue for negligence?
MR. BREIT:

Yes.

15

QUESTION:
MR0 BKEIT:

I understand your position now,
On page 11 of the Committee Report* the

Committee recognizes the need for special provisions to deal
with the case where a longshoreman* a shipbuilder or repairman
is employed directly by the vessel.

In such case* notwith­

standing the fact that the vessel is the employer, the Supreme
Court in Reed v, Yaka and Jackson v. Lykes held that the unseaworthy remedy is available to the injured employee.

It

then goes on to say that it wants to retain that right of
action against the ship owner.
Throughout something like 1200 pages of testimony*
there was never once a statement of proportionate fault pro­
pounded to the Congress.

One speaker, a gentleman by the name

of Kaplan* who spoke on behalf of a plaintiff's bar, in passing
mentioned that it may be a harsh rule to put all of the burden
on either the ship owner or the stevedore and perhaps some
proportionate fault would be appropriate and he was immediately
shot down.

And that was the only time it was ever mentioned

in the reports«
QUESTION:
MR» BREIT:

Who shot him down?
Multiple other speakers.

Actually, it

was the Senator who was questioning him who shot it down.
I've forgotten* quit® frankly, who

-- Mr. Eagleton, yes*

that’s correct -- shot it down and it was never heard from
aga in

16
Mr* Vickery#In his article which was cited by
Judge Haynsworth# suggests that Congress had intended that.
However# he was on the witness stand for a substantial length
of time.

His testimony is many pages long and he never once

throughout his entire testimony mentioned the issue of pro­
portionate fault# or anything that resembled it.
Wow# they did put in a comparative negligence rule,»
But the comparative negligence rule was a rule aimed at aiding
the injured longshoreman# so that he did not suffer the harsh
common law rule of being barred In the event he is confcributorily negligent in any degree.
QUESTION:

Hasn't that kind of comparative negli­

gence always been part of admiralty law?
MR. BREIT:

Yes# sir# and it was specifically

retained by statute here.
QUESTION:
MR. BREIT:

Why did it have to be?
Why?

Because In the legislation they

said that the right of recovery by the longshoreman shall be
identical to land-based law; and# therefore# to preserve It
they added the comparative negligence# the lack of assumption
of risk# other doctrines that were not land-based.
In short# what we have here -«=
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

f

I don't know whether

■

you saw your light — white light# warning you of your rebuttal?
MRL BREIT:

All right# sir.

I will take just one or

17
two more moments and then -- I did not see it.
The other issue which I would like to bring out is
this.

In effect* what we are asking the Court to do is to

legislate* because the statute seems clear that it never in­
tended a doctrine of proportionate fault0

In Section 933? it

specifically said that when the stevedore filas suit* he is
entitled as the first order of business to recover his ex­
penses and every penny that he has paid,

And his suit* of

course* is derivative.
This Court in Higginbotham declined to legislate or
go further when it was posed with a statutory interpretation.
This Court just a few weeks ago* in Rasmussen -- I think
Mr. Justice Rehnquist wrote it — declined to go further in
interpreting the Act.
It is suggested that this Court again should not
attempt to legislate when it became clear what Congress had
intended.
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF- JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Tucker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES F. TUCKER* ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE; RESPONDENT
MR. TUCKER:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it pleas© the

Court:
The question before the Court for determination* it
seems to me* is one of fairness and equity.

And it is whether’

18
or not a ship owner, which has been found by a jury fco be only
20$ at fault for an accident, shall be required fco pay full
damages fco the Plaintiff, while the stevedore employer found
fco be 70$ at fault, recovers the full amount of its compensa­
tion lien, and thus shares none of the financial burden of fche
loss.
Now, 1 think ifc is important fco understand or con­
sider what the Congress was trying to do in adopting fche 1972
Amendments fco the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Compensation
Act.

Ifc is clear fchafc they acted in order fco correct a number

of inequities which had developed over the years.

Primarily,

of course, ifc was fco provide a liberal system of compensation
for longshoremen, the injured parties, but secondarily it was
certainly fco more equally distribute the financial burden
occasioned by an accident among the three parties involved,
the longshoreman himself, the ship owner and the stevedore.
And I think here it is important to recognize what
had happened under litigation which had developed under fche
Longshoremen's Act, and Mr. Breifc has referred fco the Sierackl
case and fche Ryan case,, And it had developed,as you know, that
longshoremen were given the warranty of seaworthiness and
could recover against a vessel owner, not only for negligence
but for unseaworfchiness, which, in effect, almost made fche
ship owner an insurer for fche safety of the longshoremen.
In order to correct this inequity, or in an attempt

19

to, the Hyan doctrine allowed the ship owner to claim back
over against the stevedoring company for indemnity.

And the

stevedore ended up in that type of three-party litigation by
not only paying compensation but by paying full damages, assessed
by a jury or the court.

This was recognised by everyone as

being quite inequitable.
If you adopt the position of the Plaintiff, Petioner
in this case, we are going right back to the same old inequity,
except it now falls on the ship owner instead of on the steve­
doring company.

And I don't believe, as Judge Haynsworth

stated in his opinion, that it was ever the intent of the
Congress, while taking away on the one hand the right of the
ship owner to recover any indemnity from the stevedoring
company to then saddle the ship owner with full liability for
an accident when it may well have been only slightly at fault
and the stevedoring company greatly at fault.
This was not the intent of the Congress, as shown
by the legislative history, and could not have been, we contend,
in light of the historical background of the Longshoremen and
Harbor Worker's Compensation Act, as it existed prior to 1972.
How, there was also one other intention of the Congress,
I believe, in the 1972 Amendments.

And that was to provide a

liberal compensation scheme, whereby the longshoremen could
look to the Act, to compensation,for full satisfaction for
his injuries, and would not have to file a third-party action

20
against anyone* except under unusual circumstances* in order
to recover compensation.
The result, as suggested by the Petitioner* would
do away with this intention of the Congress.
Now* the decision of the Fourth Circuit, the en banc
decision* serves to further the purposes of the Amendments* by
balancing the equities among the three parties.

As this de»

cision has indicated* the ship owner will pay its proportionate
fault.

In this case, the jury found they were 20$ at fault for

the accidente

The longshoreman recovers not only his statutory

benefits under the Act which this case serves to show were quite
'C-'V-

liberal.

He has already received in excess of $50*000 in com-

pensation paynents.

But in addition* he will recover the 20$

liability damages which the jury has said are attributable to
the ship owner.
QUESTION: Reduced by the percentage of his own
negligence?
MR, TUCKER:

Yes* sir.

Well* he was found to be

10$ at fault* and 1 don't think that anyone contends that -QUESTION:
MR, TUCKER:
QUESTION:

Apparently* there is no issue about it,
That's correct.
In any event* that liability would be

reduced —»
MR, TUCKER:
was $100*000.

It would be reduced.

The total judgment

It would be reduced to $90*000,

21

QUESTION:

And your contention is that It ought to

be $18,000?
MR. TUCKER:

No, sir.

The ship owner's liability is

20$. of the whole, 20$ of $100,000.
QUESTION:
MR. TUCKER:

$20,000, reduced by..—» to $18 — isn't it?
No, sir,

I don't think so.

I think

the reduction is in the total award, which ivould mean $90,000.
QUESTION:

Under these circumstances, the longshore­

man had no action against the stevedoring, because the compensation was a substitute for the tort act?
MR. TUCKER:

The longshoreman received compensation

from his employer, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

And he could not, therefore, have sued

in tort.
MR. TUCKER:

Correct, no.

The employer is statu­

torily immune from liability.
QUESTION:
Mr. Tucker.

These numbers have me confused now,

;

I wonder if you would recapitulate. Dollars

i

and percentages.

Who pays what?

MR. TUCKER:
to the jury.

The judge propounded interrogatories 1

He first asked them was there any fault -- was

there any negligence on the part of the ship owner, and if so
in what percentage.
The jury said 20$0

He then said, "Was the steve­

doring company negligent in any way, and if so In what

22

percentages"

And they answered 70$»

And he then said, "Is

the Plaintiff, himself, negligent in any respect, and if so
in what percentage?" And they answered 10$.

And then they

answered in total damages $100,000.
The district judge entered judgment reluctantly for
$90,000, and it then went to the Fourth Circuit and the Fourth
Circuit then reversed.
QUESTION:

Under the District Court's judgment of

$90,000, $50,000 would have been paid by the stevedore, is
that right?
MR. TUCKER:

No, sir.

Let's assume the judgment

was reinstated.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be credited against the

$90,000, the $50,00 received in compensation?
MR. TUCKER:

Well, they would recover that back.

The ship owner would pay $90,000 to the Plaintiff.

The

P3.aintiff would be required to pay back $50,000.
QUESTION:

Therefore, the net payment by the

ship owner would have been $40,000, is that it?
MR. TUCKER:

Yes, sir, that's correct.

sorry, that's not correct.
would be $90,000.

No, I'm

The net payment by the £3hip owner

I am sorry.

You see, the ship owner pays the total $90,000.

Out

of that judgment, the Plaintiff is required to reimburse the
stevedoring company for what it has paid.

23
QUESTION:

So* the stevedore is coming home free*

basically?
MR® TUCKER:

That*s exactly right»

And that has

been our point* Your Honor* that it is certainly most in­
equitable for the stevedoring company* which is the party in

one of them and collects for all hie damages* even though
that one is only 20% at fault and somebody else who is not
sued is 80$ at fault* the person not sued gets off scofet free.

The difference here* Mr»Justice* was

that these people* the stevedore and the ship owner* are not
joint tort-feasors.

will get to this — we feel that the case law* as it has

developed in this Court, has now modified that rule and we
feel it no longer applies in this situation.

We think that in

all fairness and equity, which we believe the Court has tried
to do in many of its decisions that affect this, such as Cooper
Stevedoring and Re 1 lab 1 e Trans fer — certainly indicate that
proportionate fault is what we should be aiming for.

is just the next step in this type of litigation which will
take the burden and apportion it among the parties involved.

I am not condemning you for it, but I just -.

QUESTION:

Some people call it a wrong, or instead

of negligence call it a fault.

But it is still the same

concept.
MR. TUCKER;

Yes.

YTour Honors, I’d like to speak for a moment with
regard to the issue of proportionate fault, because I feel that
that, along with the fairness and equitable argument In this
case, is the basis upon which the Fourth Circuit decided this
case.
The legislative history, contrary to what counsel
for Petitioner claim, clearly states that the vessel shall not
be liable in damages for the acts or omissions of the steve­
dore.

They said it on page 4703 of the Congressional Report,

quote, "A vessel shall not be liable in damages for acts or
omissions of stevedores.1'
It could not be clearer.
This Court has stated in recent decisions, and the
Fourth Circuit is nox^j in accord with the doctrine of compara­
tive fault.

The Cooper Stevedoring case permitted contribution

among joint tort-feasors in a situation, admiralty situation
and in non-collision cases, which was done in order to correct
the inequity of one bearing the entire loss, though the other
may have been equally or more to blame.

35
So the old rule against no contribution in noncollision cases was changed by this Court,
In Reliable Transfer,, in collision cases, the old
rule of equally divided damages was changed to one requiring
allocation in proportion to fault.

And this Court said that

the standard should be adopted allocating liability according
to fault wherever possible.

i~

And this is exactly what the Fourth Circuit has done
and which we contend is the fairest and most equitable rule
for this Court to adopt,
QUESTION:

Mr. Tucker, do you have a comment on your

opponent's argument that the second sentence of the statute was
merely intended to preserve the rule of the Yaka case?
MR. TUCKER:

Yes, sir.

Clearly, it ivas Intended to

recognize the special situation where the longshoreman is em­
ployed by the vessel owner to run the stevedoring or ship
repair services.

But we contend that that was not the only

reason for placing it in there, that it was placed in there to
emphasize what seemed to be clear in the congressional intent
that the ship owner should not be liable for the acts or omis­
sions of the stevedore.
recall.

And it says that quite clearly, as I

The sentence involved:

"If such person was employed

by the vessel to provide stevedoring services, no such action
shall be permitted if the injury was caused by the negligence
of persons engaged in providing stevedoring services to the

vessel

n

Ifc seems perfectly clear.
In our brief, we have commented on the fact that the
two sentences -- the first sentence and the second and the
third — if you read than literally, cannot possibly mean what
thejr seem to say, because, if you read them literally, it would
indicate that if the longshoreman is employed by an independent
contractor to provide stevedoring services, and if there is any
negligence on the part of the vessel owner, then ha recovers
100$.

Whereas, if you read the second and third sentences that

way, you find that if he is employed by the ship owner to render
stevedoring services, then any fault of the stevedoring ~people providing stevedoring services cause the accident, then
he recovers nothing.

And I don't think that anyone could contend

that the Congress intended to do that.

And the only way to

reconcile the two sentences is to read them to mean to the
extent the injury was caused by the fault of the vessel or the
fault of the stevedoring ~~ people employed to render steve­
doring services.

And if you read ifc that way, ifc is entirely

consistent and also consistent with the language of the Act and
the legislative history, which indicates fchafc they shall not
be responsible for acts or omissions of the stevedore.

39
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP CALVIN VI. BREIT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BREIT:

Just one very brief comment.

I realize

it Is beyond the normal time for the Court.
In Cooper v. Stevedoring in 197^* this Court held
that Halcyon v. Haenn was still good law under the facts.

Those

facts are identical in all respects with the case here* a
stevedore who is immune from suit by the injured party and
sues the ship owner and recovers in full.

There is no con­

tribution in tort from that immune employer.
intended to keep that.

The statute

When the statute said that "the em­

ployer shall not be liable to the vessel for such damages,
directly or indirectly, and any agreements or warranties to
the contrary shall be void,”

it was specifically intended by

Congress* regardless of the equities as argued here, that the
stevedore not play a part in the tort action or not suffer
contribution by waiving what would normally be the lien that
it 3hould recover.
And in exchange for that* the stevedores have paid
two* three and sometimes four times as much in weekly compen­
sation as they did before the Act.

They gave up what was a

relatively small payment and the triparte litigation and got
in exchange higher payments, but absolutely no litigation.
That was the purpose of the statute.

And if we follow the

Fourth Circuit* we must then implead the stevedore in this case.

40

and in every case* to find out what is the percentage of their
fault.
This was an ex parte determination of 70$ * in which
they played no part or hearing* and clearly if they were there
advocating their position* as they must do under the Fourth
Circuit in every other case from here on in* they become a
party to the litigation,

It’s exactly what Congress was in­

tending to avoid.
QUESTION:

What do you have to say about whether this

case might be back here -- could conceivably be back here -~
after the District Court acts? •
MRo TUCKER:

If the Court rules that the longshoreman

is entitled to his common law remedy of 100$ recovery from
the ship owner* which we have espoused and the other circuits
have held* then no one will ever be back here* because he will
be required to repay his lien to the stevedore and receive a
credit against future compensation which may be payable.
don't know now what the lien is.

We

We may never know what the

lien is until this man dies* because it is an on-going lien
and each year it is subject to change under a formula devised
by Congress geared to inflation.

So that each year his formula

changes.
We suggest that there would be no further litigation
except if this Court says that the Fourth Circuit is correct.
And we would have to go down to the District Court and fight

over the distribution* and then every case thereafter will have

v

to be fought*with the stevedore involved* to determine whether
they are 70, 60* 50 or 30$ at fault»

And Congress did not

intend that.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
