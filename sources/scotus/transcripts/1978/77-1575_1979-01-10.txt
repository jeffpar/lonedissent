MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G„ WALLACE, ESQ«,
ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION et al
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
This case presents statutory and constitutional
challenges under the First and Fifth Amendments to three
V

related sets of rules of the Federal Communications Commission
relating to cable television requiring certain defined cable
systems in one rule to have the capacity by 1936 to provide
at least 20 channels of service to their subscribers.
In another rule, to provide access to certain of
those channels, if demand exists, access to third parties and
if there is sufficient activated channel capacity and in the
third set of rules, to have available and make available certain equipment and facilities to those parties and for those,
purposes.
I will summarize briefly the ru3.es and then dis­
cuss later
the argument

pertinent details as they relate to portions of

4
Channel capacity rules I think were really ade­
quately summarized in what I said already,,

By 1906

20

channels should be available to their subscribers.
The access rules apply to four categories of third
parties who will have access to the extent there is available
capacity for their access.

The public, educational authorities,

local governments and paying lessors for those systems that
were already in operation by June 21st, 1976, there is basi­
cally no obligation to bump any established programming other
than automated, time and weather service which is a sort of
ticker tape kind of informational programming.
For systems constructed thereztfter or for new
V

capacity that is added to existing systems, there is a re­
quirement that at least one channel be available for access
by these groups but to the extent that the demand does not
require more than one channel it can be a composite channel
for access.
The third category of rules, the equipment availa­
bility rules, are basically designed to see to it that the
equipment is there so that the people with the access rights
will have some way of coining into the studio and having their
programming broadcast.
The Court of Appeals treated the rules together
rather than separately and struck down all of them under the
Act but also expressed the view quit® firnly that the rules

5

would in any event violate the Constitution so that in our
view, if the Court agrees with our contentions that the rules
are authorised by the Act, it should go ahead and address the
const!tufcional issues since the result of a remand would be
foreordained in the case.
And the statutory question should not really be
considered in isolation in the constitutional contention in
any event.
Now, more than tan years ago in the United States
against Southwestern Cable Company, this Court established
that Section 2A of the Communications

Act does confer juris­

diction on the Commission over cable television.
QUESTION;

Yes, before you go into that, let us

go biick just a moment, Mr. Wallace.

Why do you suppose the

Court of Appeals addressed the constitutional question, if it
found that what the Commission did was not authorized by the
Act?
MR. W,ALLACE;

Well, as Judge Webster pointed out

in his concurring opinion, there was no need to do so but two
of the judges chose. to do so and the questions ware argued to
the court and perhaps it was to make clear what would happen,
if this court should disagree with the Court of Appeals on the
statutory issue as it did in the last Midwest video case, disagree with the same Court of Appeals* interpretation of the
Commission's statutory jurisdiction.

s
QUESTION:

You mean it is a typical alternative

ground for decision?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, they refrain from calling it

an alternative holding but they made quite clear their view
that the rules

d© violate the First Amendment and suggested

strongly that they would violate the Fifth Amendment as well.
They did refrain from stating explicitly there was
an alternative holding effect.

They stated that the holding

was based entirely on statutory grounds.
QUESTION:

Do you think that, or did they indicate

in your view that their statutory holding was influenced by
their constitutional views?

Sometimes, you know, because of

constitutional difficulties, one feels compelled

to construe

a statute a certain way.
MR. WALLACE:
that question.

It is really hard for me to answer

I don't think the opinion is all that clear

on the extent to which the constitutional view influenced the
statutory holding,

I can’t really speak for the Court on that.

In any event, the southwestern case thus established
*

the basic statutory authority on the face of the Act, at least
so long as the regulations adopted by the Commission are, as
this Court put it, "reasonably ancillary to its jurisdiction
over broadcasting."
Then almost seven years ago now in what we refer
to as "Midwest Video I" in the briefs, this Cctirt held that

7
that statutory authority extends to rules requiring cable
systems and to put the holding in somewhat generic terms used
by the plurality opinion, the rules requiring the systems
affirmatively to promote the statutory provisions of the Act
such as increasing outlets for community expression and providing more programming choices for the public»
Now, to a large extent —
QUESTION:

It is rather difficult to describe that

as a holding, is it not, in view of the fact of the Chief
Justice's concurrence in the result.
MR. WALLACEs
Court.

Yes, but there was a judgment of the

There was a holding that the rules were valid.
QUESTION:

Upholding a particular set of rules

but the reasoning for upholding them cannot really be attri­
buted to the Court.
MR. WALLACEs

Well, I understand that but on the

other hand there was no disagreement in any of the opinions
with that proposition and this is, I think, an accurate generic
categorisation of the rules that were at issue before the
Court and it was the Commission's own description of the rules
and the basis for its authority.
Now, I grant you there is no opinion of the Court
and we are quite aware of that.

Nonetheless, in Midwest video

the Court had before it many similar questions to the
statutory questions that are now before the Court.

The rules

s
there did have an equipment availability component that really
is basically the same as the present equipment availability
rule*

It was put there as part of the ~ and it is referred

to explicitly by the Court,

It was part of the origination of

programming requirement and the Court was ruling

against the

background of the rules that had been involved in the South­
western Cable Company ease in which a plurality of the court
against that had bean correctly upheld subsequently by several
courts of appeals, namely, rules that required certain signal
carriage, mandatory access, if you want to use that word, man­
datory carriage is usually used in that context of local tele­
vision programming by the cable system so we are talking, the
access component in the sense of mandatory carriage is some­
thing that has been familiar since the beginning, since the
outset of the Commission's regulation of cable television and
was precisely what was before the Court in Sou th we stern Cable,,
QUESTIONS

Are you saying that mandatory access

was necessary to the decision of the Court in Southwest Cable?
MR. WALLACES

No, the Court merely held that the

Commission had jurisdiction to promulgate rules on this subject.
It did not uphold the validity of the rules but subsequent
Court of Appeals decisions did and four Justices in the

plur­

ality opinion in Midwest Video said that those cases were
correctly decided.

That was and still, you know, the regula­

tion still exists but that was the beginning of Commission

9

regulation more than 10 years ago now, in 1966 of cable tele­
vision,

It was to require that local broadcast programs be

carried on the cable and to prohibit duplication of network
programming carried by local stations and distant signal sta­
tions»

That was the first thing that the Commission did in

this field, was to prescribe certain carriage requirements.
Now, it was not access by the public.

It was

access by broadcasters but the word access is not inappropriate
in this context.
Moreover, it was quite clear to this Court in
Midwest Video I that the origination requirement and the equip­
ment availability requirements before the Coisrt at that time
were tied in with rules then being developed and which had
been adopted by the Commission prior to this Court’s decision
in Midwest Video that it would grant rights of access to this
equipment and they also adopted channel capacity rules along
with those prior to this Court’s decision.
All of that was mad© quite clear to the Court and
as a matter of fact, the discussions during the argument in
that case were that kind of programming that was foreseen
and there were several references in the plurality opinion
background in these rules which make this quite clear.
On page 653 of Volume 406 U.S. in footnote 5 the
plurality opinion quotes th® Commission as saying one of the
purposes of the origination requirement is to ensure that

10
cable casting equipment will be available for use by others
originating on common carrier channels.
On the nest page? page 654, there is also a quotation with approval from tentative conclusions of earlier no­
tice cf rule-making that the proposed rules“Also reflect our
view

this is quoting the Commission — "That a multipur­

pose CATV operation combing carriage of broadcast signals with
program origination and common carrier services might best
exploit cable channel capacity to the advantage of the public
and promote the basic purpose for which this Commission was
created.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, do you

think in this case

these rules you are describing that the Commission has imposed
on cable telecasters would be permissible for it to impose on
broadcasters 7
MR.. WALLACE?

Well, the Court suggested in the

Democratic Ne.fcional Committee case, CBS against the Democratic
National Committee -that narrowly-defined access requirements
might be valid in broadcasting.

There is no practical way

that these rules could be imposed on broadcasting because of
the different physical constraints that are involved.

A

cablecaster has simultaneous cable running to his subscribers
and can do his own programming on the great majority of them
while still complying with those rules whereas the broadcaster
only has the one frequency assigned to him and to the extent

11
that he is required to permit anyone else to have access to it
he relinquishes his opportunity to broadcast at all on it.
QUESTION?

Why could not the Commission just say*

“You broadcast for ten hours a day and let other people broadcase for four hours a day”?
MR» WALLACE?

Well, that would be an analagous

requirement but it would, not be the same requirement.

1 mean,

you asked me if they could impose the same requirement and my
answer was that it could not be done as a practical matter.
It would have to be a requirement adapted to the
special physical situation of broadcasters and the Commission
has been concerned about the fact that it requires interruption
of the broadcasters' right to be on the air at. all, if such a
requirement is imposed, in contrast to what was adopted bore
which was basically a requirement, that unused capacity be put
to this kind of community use and that in rebuilding that
would normally take place during the next ten-year period in
new building that sufficient capacity foe built in so that
there would be basically this kind of excess capacity.
Granted, a cable television operator might argue
that he would prefer to put it to soma different use at some
kind In the future but w® are not talking about disruption of
established programming services or established pay services.
We are talking about using this technology for new additional
opportunities.

But is it not correct that the rule

a full — if the licensee
MR. WALLACE:

The rule applies but with the quali­

programming.

No but if in the next year or two they

do get enough material that they would like to put on they are

MR. WALLACE!

That is right, unless they want te

that is the difference, that if one might move to the fiirst

I think the whole contention of the Respondent herQ about
journalistic discretion is really quite overdrawn when you look

have to be taken into account in looking at the First Amend­
ment contention and in addition to the basic point about the
nature of the enterprise, the familiar signal carriage re­
quirements that I talked about before show that there has n®%yer

about what can or must be carried among the programming offered.
QUESTION?
tail for me?

Mr. Wallace, could you clear up cne de­

If the public access channel is not sufficient

to take care of the demand for public access materials, how
does the cable television company decide which applicant to
satisfy?

Is there any regulation on that?

Or is it first-

come, first-serve or do they exercise editorial jusgment?
MR. WALLACE?

The regulation says that the cable

company should adopt procedures, rules for itself to show how
it will handle requests on a first-come, first-serve basis.
This anticipates that people do not have to be
given the particular time slot that they request, that
scheduling can be done to use the capacity, that black-out time
can be used on other channels when time is available and s©
forth and if the demand gets larga enough and there is availa­
ble a second channel, then that, too, should be made available,
up to four channels if they are available.
But. the experience so far has been that a composite

16
channel pretty much is able to cover it.
There are, as the Commission indicated, quite ex­
plicitly in these rules details to be x^orked out, refinements
to be made.

This is a very dynamic field.

The Commission

has been giving it sustained attention now for more than ten
years.

It has changed direction considerably since the last

time we were in this Court with respect to cable rules.

It

gave up the origination requirement in response to commentaries
and experience.

It concluded that that would be unduly burden­

some on systems that did not want to themselves undertake to
originate programming and really using the access requirement
largely as a substitution to serve the same kinds of community
purposes and needs that the origination requirement was de­
signed for and it has cut back a great deal on the time table
for the channel capacity requirement and on the extent to
which channels have to be made available for access.
The:- basic difference is between the rules that
existed in 1972 at the time of Midwest I, not all of which
were before the Court and the present rule is that the burdens
on the cable systems have been alleviated.

The changes basi­

cally were designed to alleviate burdens that were imposed and
the main burden that was imposed was the origination rule and
it was the burden of having to become a programmer and to pro­
duce your own programming which these people had not necessar­
ily undertaken to do in setting up what basically started as

17
community antenna television systems that the four dissenting
justices in Midwest 1 found objectionable in that case and
found to extent beyond the Commission's proper regulatory
authority to commandeer someone who had undertaken merely to
carry the products of others into producing his own products
and transmitting them and the Commission's new rules really
meat that objection by coming

back with those that choose not

to get into the business of producing their own programs just
to

Mr. Wallace, could I ask you, does the

Commission have rules with respect to the acquisition or
ownership of cable systems by broadcasters or by the networks?
MR. WALLACE;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H, SHAPIRO„ ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF MIDWEST VIDEO CORPORATION
MR, SHAPIROt

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
Perhaps I should begin by answering Mr. Justice
White's question.

The FCC does have rules which prohobit

broadcast stations from owning cable television systems within
the service ar«)as of the broadcast stations, the grade B con­
tours of the imaginary line that extends —
QUESTION?

But not in other markets?

MR. SHAPIRO?

Not in other markets.

In light of — before getting to the legal argu­
ments that I would like to make, I would like to take a few
minutes to discuss some of the specifies of the rules and
their impact on cable systems because Midwest Video's percep**
tion of how those rules affect it is quite different from
that described by Mr, Wallace,
It is true that commencing on the effective date
of the rules, cable systems are required to dedicate one full
channel to use by the public for educational, governmental
public and least-access uses,

This requirement alone involves

generally one-twelfth to one-tvrentieth of the assets of the
company and we do not regard that as an insubstantial require­
ment but the rules actually require much more than that.
The rules themselves specify that four separate

19

dedicated access channels will be provided.

It is under a

qualification to the rule which indicates that if there is not
immediate demand for all four of those channels, then cable
systems may, until the demand develops, combine different types
of access programming on one channel,
Now, what type of demand requires the activation
of another channel?

It is a very minimal type of demand.

The

rules specify that the cable system must activate an additional
access channel if existing channels are in use during 80 per
cent of the weekdays, Monday through Friday, for 80 per cent
of the time during any consecutive three-hour stretch for six
weeks, six consecutive weeks.
If you apply a little mathematics to that, what
it means is that leas than two and a half hours of access use
per clay on the cable channel four days a week for six weeks
requires the activation of an additional access channel if
the system has the activative channel capacity so while there
are demand usage requirements, all of the momentum of the rules
is to encourage the implementation of more and more channels
as only minimal usage requirements are met and those requirensnfce do not end when four channels are activated.
They continue ad infinitum as I said before up to
the activated channel capacity of the cable system,
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, perhaps my colleagues do

not share ray ignorance of cable television, but what is

20

involved in activating a new channel for a cable tv operation?
MR, SHAPIRO:
nels are

Well? Your Honor, cable system chan­

a television set is only able to receive normally

12 channels of VHF transmission.

In order to add new channels,

a sable system has to — most cable systems have essentially
12 channels', at least 12 channels.
To add additional channels, a cable system has to
do one of two things.

He may be able to put in a converter

which will take signals coming down the cable at frequencies
the television set will not receive and convert them to fre­
quencies the set will receive.

This will give him extra

channels.
E.e may have to replace his old cable which may not
be able to carry more than 12 channels with other cable with
larger capacity or he may string a second cable but basically,
f channels are added in incremental blocks.
Initially, a system will have 12 channels.

The

next incremental block tends to run another eight channels or
•

-iti
bo

up to 20 and so forth.

.

All right, the access rules also require cable
■ • i*f

•

; systems to adopt their own rules requiring that the use of

:

' ®-

their channels be provided on a first-come, non-discariminatory
basis and prohibiting the cable system from exercising any
program content control over the channels.
QUESTION:

$

Mr. Shapiro, perhaps I should not ask

21
this kind of questions like Mr» Justice Rehnquisfc.

converter that would increase capacity from 12 to 20, is that
something that goes on sets or is that something that goes on

But how does the system itself get

MR. SHAPIRO:
system

Well, this depends on when the

« modern systems have the capacity to deliver 20 or

more channels if converters exist.
QUESTION3

I see.

MR. SHAPIRO:

I see.

There is evidence in the record that

the cost of converters — I believe the figure was something
like $40 per converter — that only takes cable systems up to
a total of about — somewhere between 20 and 30 channels.

It

is not the unlimited 60 or 80 type channels that you see in
some descriptions of cables.
The access rules also require sable systems to
provide one channel for public use without any charge and to
provide time for educational and local government use for a
period of five years without any charge.

No commercials can

bs presented on the public, local, governmental or — excuse
me, the public, governmental or educational access channels.

22

Cable systems must install studio and origination
equipment for the presentation of public access programs»

No

charge can be made for the use of a studio and equipment for
public access programs not exceeding five minutes in length»
And charges for longer public access programs must
be reasonable and consistent with the goal of affording a lowcost means of television access.
Moreover, if public access users produce their
own programs, cable systems cannot charge for the use of the
play-back equipment necessary or for the time of the system
personnel required

t© operate the equipment, even if the

access user wishes to run the programs outside of the normal
business hours of the cable system.
bew cable systems must foe installed with a minimum
channel capacity of 20 channels and the technical capability
for non-voice two-way return communications.

Existing systems

have until 1906 to meet these requirements»
Now, these requirements have a severe impact on
the ability of cable systems to select and present programming
to their subscribersc

There is an abundance of programming

available to cable systems to fill their channels.

That is correct

And there are numerous types of programming of

this kind that the access rules impair the ability of the
cable operator to pick and choose between.

In fact, the ques­

tion arose when Mr, Wallace was speaking about whether cable
systems ever edit any of this type of programming.

We have

cited some language in our brief from the FCC8s report and
order adopting Equal Employment Opportunity rules where the
FCG cites some examples of cable operators specifically doing
some editing of the programming that is distributed to them and
which they receive by satellite.
I would like also to make it clear, Mr. Wallace
has indicated that there would be no bumping of programming if
a cable system is presenting certain type of programming and
'an access demand arose and there was no vacant channel for

v.access.

This means that a sable system whose channels are
full and an access channel demand arises has to go to the PCC
and the FCC then has to consider? whether it ba the Madison
Square Garden programming or religious programming delivered
by satellite or whether it be movies, the FCC has to sit as a
super program director and make a judgment about whether this
access use is a more valuable use than the use that the eabl©
operator has been making of the channel,,
Well, I think that this has given sufficient back»
ground as to soma of the reasons why Midwest Video and other
'companies in the industry are concerned about these rules»
I would like to pass on for the moment now to the
jurisdictional argument and why we think that these rules
:
■

: clearly do exceed the Commission's jurisdiction.
I would like to also note? a question was raised

L:\

'earlier in the argument as to why the Eighth Circuit discussed

i.
■

bn page S3 the Court specifically states that the First Amend-

• meat overtones and other constitutional considerations present
V.'-"

la the 1976 report are such as to reinforce our conclusions on
the jurisdictional issue.
I think it is traditional that courts do? at least
it is not unusual for courts to look at constitutional issues
because it may influence their views on the jurisdiction so
that they may not be required to reach a constitutional decision.

28
Turning to jurisdiction, this Court in both Midwest
I and Southwestern held that the FCC has authority under Sec­
tion 2A of the Communications Act to regulate sable systems®
No question about that®

That is not in issue but Section 2A

in. and of itself doss not specify any objectives for which the
FCCs regulatory authority can be exercised.
Now, 2A alone, without reference to something in
the hot, we believe would be an unlawful delegation by Congress
to the FCC to legislate as it pleases and in the rules before
this Court in Midwest I, the plurality opinion upheld the rules
because it looked carefully at the statutory provisions and the
goals which the Commission indicated it would seek to implement
in adopting the mandatory origination rules and it concluded,
that the mandatory origination rule met those goals.
QUESTIONS

Which goals?

ME® SHAPIRO:

Well, the Commission — they were the

goals ©f increasing the outlets of community expression and
'providing diversified programming.
QUESTION:

So it was connected with the broadcast.

MR. SHAPIRO:

facilities on a fair? efficient and equitable basis®'

QUESTION:

That there was a judgments, yes.

vi ;-v •’

MR. SHAPIRO:

There was a judgment.

We think that

’the rules now before this Court go far beyond anything that
was contemplated in Midwest I.
•'#/,

^

We think so for two reasons.

First of all«, the rules of Midwest I were not con-

'it trary to any established goal of broadcast regulation.
••

The

....I

- '-■ Court found that they met specified goals.
Here we find that — we believe that this Court's
. opinion in CBS versus Democratic National Committee established
"the fast that the preservation of the goals of private jour­
nalism and editorial control are fundamental to broadcast

30
regulations a

The Court pointed out and Congress specifically

dealt with and finely rejected the argument that broadcast
facilities should be open on a nonselective basis to all per™
sons wishing to talk about public issues.
In responding to arguments that the First Amendment
required individual access to broadcast facilities, the Court
referred to the erosion of journalistic discretion and the
transfer of control over treatment of public issues for licen­
sees who were accountable for broadcast performance.
The government's principal answer to this is that
the access goal is that we are arguing about mutually-incon sistent goals and that while it concedes that this goal of edi­
torial control and discretion may exist, the Commission has
selected other goals and that it is within the Commission’s
discretion to select and choose between goals„
We think that the answer to this is that in the
vary decisions which were reviewed by this Court in the CBS
case in dealing with Section 3H and its relationship to the
goal of editorial judgment and control by broadcasters, the
FCC itself did not treat this goal as one to be placed in the
balance with other perhaps conflicting goals.
The FCC’s opinion treated Section 3H as a statutory
proscription and the FCC held that broadcasters ware not re­
quired to sell time to individuals or groups to comment on
public issues.

It was this determination of the FCC that the

31
Court

upheld in the CBS cess.

So if that is the FCC's policy

as applied to broadcasters and it is a statutory policy that
th® FCC regards as paramount? we have difficulty seeing how
if the Commission must look to broadcast regulatory goals for
its authority to regulate cable television? hot* it can jettison
that goal as applied to the cable systems.
We think that this Court's decision in the CBS
versus PMC case is also quite consistent with that approach.
But there is another reason why we think that these
rules far exceed these jurisdictions.

Section 3B of the Act

- specifies that a person engaged in radio broadcasting shall
not* insofar as such person is engaged? deemed a common carrier
In Midwest Video Z? the FCC's actions were not con™
"trary to any specified means of r@gulat.ion in the Act and there
"v fp«©'the subject of regulatory means was not discussed but
Section 3H prohibits the FCC from utilising common carrier
■ • means to achieve broadcast goals.
■

We think that any other conclusion — and • for that

-■

reason we do not think that — we think that the FCC is also
.' limited in the means that it can apply to cable systems.

Per-

j»h \

haps they need not be the exact same means but to permit the
FCC te apply a means specifically which withheld from them in
.■ the broadcasting area gives ~ we believe is contrary t© the
provisions ©f the Act and we think that there ar® very good
reasons for taking this position.

32
Any other conclusion would blend two types of regulations that are mutually inconsistent and they would leave the
FCC's exercise of jurisdiction over cable systems subject to
no meaningful standards*,
Some examples0

We have already discussed the fact

that editorial jugment and control are basic to broadcast
regulation but they are the antithesis of common carrier regu­
lation»

Common carrier regulation is based upon total lack of

control by the owner of the facilities.
In order to ensure that broadcasters do not prac­
tice racial discrimination in their programming judgment, and in
'the related ascertainment of community needs to be served by
their programming, the FCC can adopt equal employment oppor­
tunity rules applicable to broadcasters.
We think that this Court's decision in NAACF versus
Federal Power Canaaiesion makes it clear that most regulatory
statutes governing common carrier operations will not - support
the adoption of equal employment opportunity rules.
Government is gan@ral.ly forbidden from imposing
common carrier or public utility obligations on a business
unless it permits the business to earn a fair rate of return.
And the hallmark ©f common carrier regulation is generally
detailed rate regulation.
Broadcasting, on the other hand, is a field of
free competition without rata regulation.

The FCC does not

33
regulate most cable television rates and it forbids any govern­
ment entity from regulating rates for pay tv services that
cable systems provide»

Your Honors, it would raise the question of whether

right but it is not a subject that I have looked at closely.

I see that 1 only have a few minutes and I would

Obviously,

the subject of editorial control and the function of editors

Perhaps I should say recognised

We believe that cabl-j systems for purposes of

This is a view which not only

the Eighth Circuit below has taken but the home box office,
the DcCo Circuit and the home box office situation took a
\ similar position.

There are of course differences between a cable
system and a newspaper but in many respects they are the same»
Someone must subscribe to the services in order to receive
that service so you must snake an affirmative decision and pay
someone<,
Both offer multiple services»

They have a basic

typ© of service that people usually buy them for but they seek
fiercely additional subscribers based on other services»
With a newspaper, its basic service is news but it
g@ts r@advu.rs because of its

sports page and its comic strips

and its society page»
With a cable system, its basic service is retrans­
mission of television signals but it offers paid movies and it
offers religion and it offers sports and will soon be offering
various types of public affairs programs»
The function of a cable system is very analogous
in terms of first Amendment analysis, distribution of.informa<tr felon, to the public, to that of a newspaper»

in the history of regulation under the Communications Act,
Even if one would quarrel with the terminology, the factual

systems which retransmit television broadcast signals so that,
basically what the Chief Justice had to say in his concurring
opinion in Midwest Video X applies when he said it has been
elaborated more by himself in prior opinions and by others but
he said the essence of the matter is that when they, the cable
system, interrupt the signal, the broadcast signal and put it
to their awn use for profit, they take on burdens, one of which
is regulation by the Commission to serve the public interest

We are not dealing with a medium that ia divosesd
in important aspects of its activities from the radio spectrum.
Now, I would like to say a word about section 3H
which appears in full in the Appendix to the Commission's
"""petition on page 210.

It is section 153H of Title 47'and you

■will notice that all that is there when you read it in context
I’fci
is the definition section of the Act defining who is a common

that .the Commission is to follow in the means that It.utilises
in conducting its other regulatory activities, it certainly is
. .far from an absolute prohibition.

It is merely something to

the Act and it is entirely consistent with the suggestion made
in this Court’s opinion in CBS against the Democratic national

there is no further limitation on cable television which is not

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace? you spoke quite glowingly

©n two occasions in your response of the Chief Justice's
concurrence in Midwest Video.

In his opinion in Columbia

Broadcasting versus Democratic Committee at page 10? ©f 412
he refers to the fact that in the Act of 1934? Congress rejec­
ted a proposal that would have posed a limited obligation on
broadcasters to turn over their microphones to persona wishing

to speak out on certain public issues.
If that cannot ba required of broadcasters? do you
think it can nonetheless be required of cable broadcasters like
the Commission?
MR. WALLACE:

Well? I do not concede that it cannot

be required of broadcasters because the very same opinion points
out that limited access rules might be properly required of
broadcasters notwithstanding inferences that can be drawn from
the failure of Congress to enact an explicit requirement.
Congress nevertheless gave the Commission authority
to further public interest goals that Congress specified in

43
ways that should seem appropriate as experience with the in­
dustry develops and as needs become apparent that Congress was
not at that point willing to anticipate and I do not think that
any mere thar that opinion entirely indicates that the mere
fact that that provision was not adopted at the outset and
that the Commission is without authority because the opinion
says the contrary.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
