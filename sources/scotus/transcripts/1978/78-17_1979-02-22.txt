MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 78-17 and 78-249* consolidated* United Gas Pipe Line
Company and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against Billy
J. McCombs et al,
Mr. Allen* you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. ALLEN* ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO. 78-249
MR. ALLEN:

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:

The issue in this case is whether the Court of
Appeals was correct in the holding that Respondents and their
predecessors in interest had lawfully abandoned the service of
delivering natural gas in interstate commerce* even though the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had never authorized aban­
donment under section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act,
Section 7(b) of the Act provides that no natural gas
company may abandon the service within the Commission’s juris­
diction* quote* "without permission and approval of the Com­
mission first had and obtained after due hearing and a finding
by the Commission that the available supply of natural gas is
depleted to the extent that the continuation of service is un­
warranted or that the present or future public convenience or
necessity permits abandonment."
To summarize the pertinent facts* in 1948 a

w. R.

4
Quin

acquired an oil and gas lease of a fcracfc of land in Texas

known as the Butler B tract.

In 1953* his widow and successor

in interest* Bee Quin* entered into a gas sales contract with
United Gas Pipe Line Company under which Mrs, Quin undertook to
sell to United all merchantable natural gas produced from* quote,
all. wells now or hereafter drilled during the term of the con­
tract" on a number of tracts* Including Butler B,

In 195^»

Mrs, Quin applied for and received from the Commission a cer­
tificate of public convenience and necessity* authorizing the
sales of gas as provided for in the contract.
Subsequently* the lease was assigned several times.
One subsequent assignee amended the certificate and amended the
contract with United to extend its term to 1981 and obtained a
certificate from the Commission that authorized the service as
proposed In the amended contract and replacing the certificate
that was originally issued to Mrs. Quin.
Before 1966* one well on Butler B produced natural
gas that was delivered to United under the contract.

In 1966*

the then assignee of the lease Informed United that the well was
not producing any more gas and that no further gas would be
available at that time.
No gas was produced on the property for five years
and during that time no one applied to the Commission for
authority to abandon service under Section 7(h).
In 1971# the assignee Haring assigned part of his

5
interest in the Butler B tract to the Respondents* who drilled
a deeper well on Butler B* discovered more gas and entered into
a contract to sell that gas to a duPonfc nianfc in Texas* that is
in intrastate commerce.
In 1973^ United asserted a right to that gas under
its 1953 contract as amended.

Respondents denied that United

had any right to the gas and United filed a complaint with the
Commission* which commenced this proceeding.
In the proceeding before the Commission* Respondent" 1
principal claim was that the contracts with United and the
certificates from the Commission dedicated only the gas that
was produced in the first well that was drilled on the property*
that is the well that was drilled before 1966* but not gas pro»
duced from the well that they had subsequently drilled.
Respondents also suggested to the Commission that
even if the gas they were currently producing was dedicated to
interstate commerce* the Commission should grant them abandon­
ment authority nunc pro tunc * or retroactively* to 1966 when
production from the first well had ceased.
The Commission held that the certificate issued to
Respondents 1 predecessors dedicated all the gas produced from
the Butler B tract and thus imposed upon Respondents an obliga­
tion under the Natural Gas Act to continue supplying that gas
in interstate commerce to United.
In view of the fact that the supply of gas under

6
Butler B was concededly not depleted, the Commission also denied
Respondents' suggestion that they grant abandonment nunc pro
tunc to 1966.
The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the
facts of this case established abandonment as a matter of law,
even though the Commission had never granted abandonment.
Particularly, the Court of Appeals relied on the fact that
production had ceased during the period from 1966 to 1971» that
the parties during that period seemed to believe that there was
no more gas on the property, and that the Commission probably
would have granted an abandonment application if one had been
filed in that period.
Those facts, the Court concluded, made it unnecessary
for Respondents to comply with the requirements of Section 7(h)
which forbids abandonment without obtaining approval from the
Commission and until the Commission finds appropriate facts in
an appropriate hearing and proceeding.
In the court's view, the facts believed to be true
in 1966 —
QUESTION:

Mr, Allen, is there a routine hearing

when an abandonment application is filed?
MR. ALLEN:

There is not routinely a hearing.

statute, Mr, Justice Stevens, provides for a due hearing.

The
Where

there is an abandonment application and all of the Interested
parties are notified and the application itself demonstrates

7
depletion of supply and the interested parties concur in that
there is usually not a hearing, but where there is some dispute
there will be a hearing.
QUESTION:

I got the impression from the briefs that

normally there is not a hearing.
MR, ALLEN:

Normally, there is not a hearing.

In any event, in the Court of Appeals' view the
facts that were believed to be true in 1966 made the Commission's
participation in the abandonment process unnecessary.
Our position is that the Court of Appeals' holding
is contrary to the plain terms of Section 7(b).

In this case,

the Commission never approved abandonment and never made any of
the findings that abandonment would be warranted and, indeed,
no one ever sought the Commission's approval for abandonment
at the time that those findings might have been made.
The court's holding, thus violates the plain language
of Section 7(b), and it also violates the general principle of
administrative law that a court is not empowered to make find­
ings of fact or engage in functions that a statute entrusts
exclusively to an administrative agency,
The court’s holding that the facts of this case
established abandonment also violates the specific objectives
of Section 7(b) in at least three respects.

First, Section

7(b) serves to insure that the Commission and all of their
interested parties will have an opportunity at the relevant

8
time to examine the facts bearing on abandonment.

The court's

holding would deprive them of that opportunity because the
court found abandonment on the basis of facts that appeared to
be true in 1966* but they were never examined by the Commission,
by United or any other interested party in the kind of pro­
ceeding that Section 7(b) requires.
Second * Congress in Section 7(b) entrusted to the
Commission, as the expert agency* the task of making the deter­
minations of facts pertaining to abandonment, such as the alleged
depletion of gas supplies.
The court's holding, on the other hand, would author­
ize courts to examine those facts and to determine those facts
wholly independently of the Commission.

For example, it would

authorize courts, in this kind of case, to determine whether
the geological evidence known or available or discoverable in
1966 supported Respondents ’ predecessors 1 assertion that the
gas supply was depleted•
Third, Section 7(b) provides necessary certainty in
the entire regulatory system.

By providing that only the

Commission can grant lawful abandonment, producers, pipe lines,
purchasers and other interested parties have some way of knowing
whether gas from acreage that was once dedicated to interstate
commerce remains dedicated to interstate commerce.
Under the Court of Appeals 1 holding, such persons
would have no way of knowing whether that gas remains dedicated

9
to interstate commerce, because some court in the future might
find that some previous state of facts established a lawful
abandonment, notwithstanding the absence of any Commission
action,
Now, the holding of the Court of Appeals that the
facts established lawful abandonment appears to have been based
in part on its view that if an application had been filed with
the Commission in 1966 the Commission probably would have granted
it.

And the Respondents emphasize that notion in their brief to

this Court by arguing primarily that because the Commission
would have granted an abandonment application in 1966 the Com­
mission erred as a matter of law in failing to grant abandonment
nunc pro tunc in 1975,? nunc pro tunc to 1966,
There are two answers to that contention.
has no basis in fact.

First, it

No one knows what the Commission would

have done if an abandonment application had been filed in 1966.
No application was filed and, therefore, no one had any occasion
or reason to examine the facts ~~
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

And the Commission is different.
And the Commission is different.

That's

absolutely correct.
But, in any event, no one had any opportunity to
examine the facts in the kind of proceeding that Section 7(b)
contemplates.

Moreover, we know now that the supply of gas was,

in fact, not depleted.

And it seems very strange to assume that

10

the Commission would have made a finding that we now know fco be
false.
QUESTION:

Mr. Allen# I think your position is# if

I'm not mistakent even if they did demonstrate -- put the
Commission on the stand -- "Yes^ we would have granted it."
You'd still say they didn't have statutory authority.
MR. ALLEN:

Absolutely.

That would be our second

and principal argument.
The notion that the Commission would have granted
-- Respondents' contention that the Commission would have
granted abandonment in 1966 is totally irrelevant.

In fact, it

reflects a rather startling proposition of law that few regula­
tory agencies could operate under,

In effect^ it would mean

that any time a statute requires agency authorization for an
action^ such as a certificate to operate an air line^ or license
to sell alcoholic beverages^ a person who was charged with
failing fco obtain that authorization would have a defense^ a
legal defense that if he had applied fco the agency at some
previous and proper time the agency probably would have given
him the authority.

In essence^ that's what Respondents' position

boils down to.
QUESTION:

Co you think that might put a premium

on having some lawyers go around pursuing Mr. Justice
Marshall's suggestion and get affidavits from the-former
members of the Commission^, as some lawyers do* going around to

11

jurors after a trial.
MR, ALLEN:

It would put a tremendous premium on

such activity* Your Honor.
Respondents try to butress this argument by arguing
that Haring’s failure to apply for an abandonment application
was in* quote* "good faith."

It is hard to see on this record

what they mean by good faith* because the fact of the matter Is
that the Secretary of the Commission ^during this period of nonproduction* twice wrote letters to Respondents' predecessors
and ones to Haring* saying that "if no further sales are contem ­
plated from this property* it is going to be necessary for you
to file an abandonment application.

Furthermore* it is going

to be necessary for you to submit a statement of United with
respect to its position on abandonment."
Haring* nevertheless* conceded in his testimony in
this proceeding that he* nevertheless, made the determination
that it wasn't necessary and he didn't do it.
In conclusion* I’d like to stress what this Court
has recognized in a number of cases* namely* that Section 7(b)
Is of key importance to the Commission's regulatory responsibili­
ties under the Natural Gas Act.

Although the Commission makes

every effort to do so -- to monitor service obligations under
the Act -» there is no way that it can keep track of the per­
formance of every gas sales contract that it certificates under
the Act,

In some cases* deliveries under such contracts may

12

fluctuate from day to day or even from year to year, and in
some cases production may cease and resume several times for any
number of reasons.

But unless somebody complains to the Com­

mission, the Commission -- absolute enforcement and assurance
that the service obligations will be complied with is extremely
difficult if not impossible.
Section 7(b) is critical to the Commission's enforce­
ment powers because, as this Court recognized in Sun ray MidContinent Oil Co», it insures that the Commission keeps legal
control over service obligations even though physical facts may
be beyond its physical control.

Thus, for example, if it dis­

covers that a producer is selling gas in intrastate commerce
for sometime that it was dedicated to interstate commerce, it
may — and the producer claims that,

"Well, at some prior period

there had been a cessation of production, and I thought my
obligation had lapsed," the Commission can say, "If you thought
the supply of gas was depleted at some prior time, you should
have come to us then to prove it, but* since you didn't,your
service obligation, your legal service obligation remains. "
That's essential to the Commission's .responsibilities under the
Act.
In large measure, we submit, the Court of Appeals'
decision would undermine that regulatory authority.
With respect to the other points made by Respondents
in their brief, I'd like to rely on our reply brief and reserve

13
the balance of my time for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Mr» Allen* let me ask you one very trivial

question,
Assume the property really had been exhausted and
they never found any gas and somebody doesn't file an abandoned
application,

,Ts there any practical adverse consequence for

his failure to do so?

Or is the only adverse consequence that

you have this problem if you do later discover gas?
MR, ALLEN:

As far as I can see* this is the only

significant adverse consequence,
QUESTION;
itself,

This is a significant consequence in

I just wonder if there is anything else,
MR, ALLEN:

There might be to the Commission's

ability to monitor reserves in natural gas.

The Commission may

have some particular reasons to enforce —»
QUESTION:

I can see how the Commission might want to

clean up to keep its files current* or something of that nature,
MR0 ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Well* that's right* and if somebody —
If somebody -- any sanction on the

operator?
MR, ALLEN:

Well* if an operator wilfully refused to

file an abandonment application* as he was required to* the
Commission might have some regulatory reasons to take sanctions
against him*, even though his supply had depleted.
Thank you

MRe CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bernis,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KNOX BEMXS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO. 78-17
MR. BEMIS :

Mr. Chief Justice, and may ifc please the

Court:
Mr. Justice Stevens, you were asking of practical
consequences.
The only one that I can cite for you is the producer
has to continue to file reports on the particular acreage.
That, in fact, is

apparently

how the Commission knew to send

the letters to the producer involved here asking him to file
ior abandonment.
I intend to speak primarily of the reasons why a
pipe line and its customers need the safeguards of Section 7(h)
of the Natural Gas Act, and why these safeguards would be under­
cut by the holding of the Tenth Circuit and the position of the
McCombs group here,
I also intend to speak of the practical problems and
uncertainties that would arise, either from the holding of the
court below or the position of the McCombs group,
One of the statutory purposes of Section 7(b), as
indicated in the due hearing language in that section, is that
interested parties be afforded the opportunity to be heard
when a producer or any other natural gas company files for
abandonment

Indeed4 it is the Commission's policy and practice fee
issue notices of the filing of such applications* such notices
giving any interested party the chance to come in and state any
objections.

That opportunity is afforded whether or not a formal

hearing is actually held.
Now* of course* in this case* there was no such
hearing.

There was no such notice.

formal notice even.

Indeed* there was no in­

The producer never asked United either to

agree to abandonment of the certificate or to release the pro­
ducer from his contract obligations,
Now* it is asserted by the McCombs group and*
apparently* assumed by the court below that abandonment would
have been routinely granted if it had been sought.

That* how­

ever* is by no means clear.
First of all* it is by no means clear in this
circumstance that United* having a contract that it regarded sc
still being in effect with the user* would have agreed* would
have consented or would have agreed not to object* if you will.
Second* we have here the question of whether the
reserves were* in fact* depleted in 1966.
Now* a lot of the routine abandonment cases* I
believe* involve a situation where you have no indication
whatsoever of continuing production.

We know that on the

Butler B lease in 1966* despite the cessation of the natural
gas production* there was production from an oil well.

In other

16

words, you have continuing hydrocarbon productions all the way
through the period.

Furthermore, the record does not show the

extent. If any, to which there were deeper tests in areas
adjoining or close by the Butler B lease, when the producer
asserts abandonment would have been routinely granted.
So, I think, it is —
QUESTION:

This is happening with coal mines.

After

the coal mines have been — not regulated as these are -- have
been abandoned and when the price of steel

I should have said

iron mines, When the price of steel went up, it became economic
to operate what had previously been an abandoned mine, abandoned
because It was not economic to operate It,
MR. BfiMIS:
QUJeSTIOM:

That’s exactly right,
Exactly the situation you would have here,

could have here,
MR. BEMIE:

Yes, that’s very close to this situation.

I believe what happened here was they drove for deeper reserves.
That is, of course, related to the economics of the situation.
QUESTION:

New equipment is developed over a period

of time,
MR. BSMIS:

That is correct too.

And, indeed, this is not an uncommon situation.
The fact that production ceased at one time in the past is by
no means in itself indicative of there being no future gas pro­
duction, of the supplies being exhausted, within the meaning of

17

Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act,
So* we really do not know what would have happened*
even though* as the McCombs group points out* there were a
number of routine abandonment applications granted during that
period,
That* incidentally* is not so more recently.

In fact*

there is a recent decision of the Commission* a proceeding in­
volving Texaco* where the Commission declined to grant them on
essentially the same facts as would have appeared here in the
period 1966 through 1971*
The right of the interstate pipe line and its
customers has been cut off by the decision of the Tenth Circuit
and would be cut off by the position adopted by the McCombs
group here.
#

In its brief* the McCombs group argued that the
hearing in this proceeding is an adequate substitute for the
hearing that should have been held on the abandonment applica­
tion they should have filed in 1966.
maintained.

That clearly cannot be

The hearing In this case involved the question of

retroactive abandonment* of course.

It also has as its basis*

as its starting point* the knowledge that the central fact that
the producer would have been trying to establish then* i.e.
depletion of reserves* Is false.

In other words* it is very

difficult to have a due hearing about whether the reserves have
been depleted when you know that they have not been depleted and

18

you are trying to speculate as to what the parties would have
thought about depletion if the hearing had been held at seme
date in the past*
So.» clearly* the hearing in this proceeding cannot
substitute for what was the party’s right under Section 7(b) at
the earlier date.
I would like to speak also to the practical problems
and uncertainties that would stem from the decision of the court
below or the position of the McCombs group.
The abandonment order is at present a definitive*
reliable and public document
Is still dedicated.

telling you whether the.acreage

There would be substituted for that* under

the decision of the court below* a determination by the parties*
I suppose* whether at scan© point in the past people would reasonably have thought the reserves to have been depleted.

More­

over the court below speaks about the length of time — five
years — beti^een the less production and the new production.
If that Is a factor* how long did it have to be?
Simarly* on the position of the McCombs group* you
have to determine not only those factors* but also whether there
is good faith involved.
The McCombs group also makes the point that the
abandonment orders themselves may not be recordable* and argue
that that’s the reason for not requiring abandonment.

However*

the problem there is not whether you can record the abandonment

19

orders.

The real problem and the real goal is to put the

producers on notice, or to put subsequent lesees on notice,
that there is a gas purchase contract, an obligation in that
respect.

That was on record here.

United had filed in the

land records the evidence of Its contract, and it did, indeed,
turn up in one of the title opinions that the producers got.
It is easy to find out, if you are on notice of the
contract, whether the property has been certificated and whether
an abandonment has been granted.

You can get it from the pipe

line, if nowhere else.
Finally, I would like to mention this.

At one point

in McCombs ’ brief, page 19/ there is a quotation from fcne testi­
mony of a United witness, Mr. Alban, that suggests that United
thought and took the position that the certificate obligation
terminated when the property ceased to produce in 1966.

That

is not correct and that's not the implication of his testimony.
It Is not just the implication of his testimony, he says some­
thing very different in the record.
The record will show that what he was talking about
was United's right, as it construed it, to remove a metering
station because It was a gathering facility, not because any
certificate obligation terminated.
action here

United never took any

that indicated that it felt that either the cer­

tificate obligation or the contract obligation had terminated.
Thank you.

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Cunningham.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY L» CUNNINGHAM, ESQ. ,
ON'BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR* CUNNINGHAM:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may ifc please

the Court:
There is a threshold issue in this case about what
the Court of Appeals held.

The Commission and United read the

Court of Appeals' opinion as engaging in prohibited judicial
fact finding and as bypassing the Commission's functions.
Vie, on the other hand, make no such reading of the
Court of Appeals' opinion.

And, as I present my argument this

morning, I will point out the relevant passages of the Court of
Appeals' opinion which we believe support

our reading thereof.

In Opinion Number 7^0, the Commission took two actions
which fom the basis of the issues before the Court.

First, the

Commission failed to grant McCombs' request to retroactively
apply the Act as if Haring had applied for abandonment and had
filed the proper papers in 1966,
Second, the court ordered McCombs to deliver gas to
United on the grounds that the words "service rendered," as used
in Section 7(b) are not to be accorded their plain meaning.
On judicial review, McCombs argued to the Court of
Appeals that both of these holdings constituted error.

We

believe that a proper reading of the Court of Appeals' opinion

21

.indicates that the court agreed with us on the first issue and*,
therefore* found it unnecessary to discuss the second.
The first issue depends on the application on an
equitable principle which had been worked out between the
courts and the Commission for a period of nearly 40 years and
which does not involve the interpretation of any federal statute
This principle and the principle which was urged to the Court
of Appeals was that where a party is in good faith in failing to
file the proper papers with the Commission at the proper time#
the Commission should retroactively apply the Act as if the
party had complied with the Act at the proper time.
This principle is supported by four decisions of the
Courts of Appeals cited in our brief,

I would point out that

the Courts of Appeals have required the Commission to apply the
principles uniformly* regardless of whether it benefited or
burdened the party failing to file.
Thus* in the Niagara Mohawtc case cited in our brief*
the application of the principle burdened the party* for the
reason that it obtained a hydroelectric^ license for a shorter
duration than It would otherwise have received.
However* in the Highland case* also cited in our
brief* the party failing to file was benefited because it
achieved higher rates than it would otherwise have been per­
mitted .
Similarly* in Plaquemines and Bllwood, cited in our

22
brief,» fche party failing fco file was benefited for the reason
that they were not required to make refunds °>MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1:00 o'clock.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 noon the Court recessed fco
reconvene at 1:00 o'clock fche same day.)

23

AFTERNOON BEEP JON
(1:02 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel., you may resume»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY L. CUNNINGHAM* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

(Resumed)

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
Before the luncheon recess* I was discussing the
equitable principle in this case that where a party is in good
faith in failing to file the proper papers with the Commission
at the proper time* that the Commission should retroactively
apply the Act as if the party had complied therewith.
I pointed out that this principle has been required
by the courts to be applied in situations where it both benefits
and burdens the party failing to file.
The application of the principle involves asking the
present Commission to* in the language of the Plaquemines case*
reconstruct the past to reflect compliance with the Act* and
does not* therefore* involve the obtaining of affidavits or
sworn statements from past Commissions as to what they might
have done with the situation.
Moreover* the principle applies to Section 7(b) of
the Natural Gas Act* as demonstrated by the Commission's own
order in the Hewitt and Dougherty case* which is cited in our
brief.

In that case* the reserves were depleted before this

24

Court's decision in fche Phillips case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cunningham, how far back does your

nunc pro tunc rule run?
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

It has a history of about forty

years, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Would it go back that long?

MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

You mean the —

Would you say let's consider something

that happened forty years ago as having been done?
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

Your Honor, the principle, I think,

would be applicable, regardless of the time span between the
date fche filing should have been made and fche date the filing
was actually made.

In some of these cases, the time span runs

from five to ten years.

I don't recall a case that has had a

time span which is longer than ten years, for example.
QUESTION:

Under your theory, should not the Com­

mission have been directed to hold the hearing that was never held
because he didn't file at the right time?

And that's not what

the Court of Appeals ordered,
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

Your Honor, there was a hearing

before the Commission,
QUESTION:

But they didn't make all these findings.

They didn't find that they would have granted the abandonment
if fche petition had been filed in time, did they?
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

They refused to apply fche Act

25

retroactively, not on the grounds that if they had applied the
Act retroactively that they would have found in 1966 that the
reserves were totally exhausted.
QUESTION:

What I am saying is that if your theory

were correctly applied by the Court of Appeals, should not the
Court of Appeals have remanded the matter to the Commission with
directions to hold a hearing and dec5.de what it would have de­
cided in 1966, if a timely application had been filed?
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

No, Your Honor, because the evidence

in 1966 was that of Haring who was a petroleum geologist who
testified that at the time his reserves were depleted in 1966
that neither he, nor United nor anyone else knew of any further
res erv es.
Now, in the light of that testimony, the Commission
could only have made one finding concerning the situation as it
existed in i960; and that finding was, as required by the statute,,
that the available supply of natural gas was depleted.
Now, that finding -»
QUESTION:

You are saying that the Court of Appeals

has found ay a fact that this is true and It is so clear that
we know that the Commission would have come to the same con­
clusion if they had had a hearing?
MR* CUNNINGHAM:
con trover feed .

The evidence in the record is un­

If the Commission had found the other way, con-

ceining che faces in 19o6, that would have been revers3.ble as

26

being contrary to the evidence.
QUESTION:

That's not the standard of review, of

course, just contrary to the evidence.

It would have to be no

substantial evidence supporting a finding -MR. CUNNINGHAM:

There would have been no substantial

evidence which would have supported a finding that the reserves
were not depleted in 1966.
In the Hewitt and Dougherty case, which shows that
this orinelple is applicable to Section 7(b), the reserves were
depleted before this Court's decision in the Phillips case.

And

the Commission then applied the Act as if Hewitt and Dougherty
had complied with faction 7(b).
United and the Commission seek to distinguish these
case?’ on the grounds that they arose out of previously unannounced
points of law.

Yet, in the Plaquemines case, the filing should

have been made after the Commission announced that it had juris­
diction under the Lobaka case,

bimarly, in Eiiwood a part of

the refunds, and a substantial part of the refunds, were Incurred
after the Commission asserted jurisdiction in what ultimately
became the Colten case before this Court.
In Highland, the party failing to file was simply
relying on Commission regulations.

And here, the Court of

Appeals observed that there were no cases which dealt with
similar factual circumstances.
(5>Q the common thread of all these cases is that the

27
party failing to file was in good faith.

And once you have made

that finding* then you proceed to retroactively apply the Act
as if the party had complied with the provisions of the Act at
the proper time.
Concerning the issue of good faith* the courts have
required more than mere ignorance of the law or mere inadver­
tence in filing.

In each case cited in our brief and in this

case* the party failing to file was aware of the filing require­
ment* but there were facts and circumstances in each case which
made the party believe in good faith that those filing require­
ments were inapplicable.
The Court of Appeals8 opinion first stressed exten­
sively the facts relating to Haring’s good faith and why he
felt it was unnecessary to file.
acquired

Thus*

the Butler B lease* there

which was not producing.

in 1966* when Haring

was one well on that lease

Haring attempted to restore production

by diligent efforts but was unsuccessful.

Both the buyer and

the seller recognized that there could be no more gas produced
and this was contrary to their wishes.

United removed its

equipment and Haring believed that the contract was at an end.
Haring was a petroleum geologist and* as I've stated* testified
that in 1966 neither he nor anyone else knew of any further gas
reserve.
Haring believed it was unnecessary to file the papers
which the court observed could* in view of the facts* have only

28

been for the purpose of tidying up the record.

Since Haring

believed the 1953 contract had been ended, he did not inform
McCombs about it.

McCombs acquired his interest in the Butler

B lease, relying on a 1967 title opinion which failed to mention
the 1953 contract,

McCombs was, therefore, unaware that Haring

had not filed with the Commission until the hearings before the
Commission in this case,
QUESTION:

Isn't that episode one of the good indi»

cations why these abandonments should always be a matter of
record, so that the title examiner can know what the situation
is?
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

I think they should be a matter of

record, Your Honor, but in most states the abandonment orders
of the Commission are unrecordable, and indeed inquiry to the
Commission would prove useless for the reason that the Commission
records are not kept so that the -QUESTION:

When you say they are unrecordable, under

state law you mean?
MR, CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes,

Well, a careful examiner when he is

dealing xvifch this kind of property isn't going to rely just
on the register of deeds or the registrar, whatever it may be.
He is going to communicate with the Commission, isn't he?
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

That was my point. Your Honor,

Inquiry to the Commission would be fruitless for the reason

29
that the Commission's records are not kept In a manner so that
it can be determined whether abandonment has been granted with
respect to any particular tract.

And, indeed, the record in

this case in the Commission's opinion below indicates that the
'Commission has destroyed its records of a certain vintage, as of
1964, so that nothing can be told about records of that vintage.
As evidence of Haring's good faith and belief that he did
not have to file, we pointed out in our brief that United also
did not believe it had to file, although this Court in the
United case decided in the same year, 1966, had said that dection
7(b) is equally applicable to the purchaser»

Thus, the United

witness testified that he didn't believe that it was necessary.
QUESTION:

How much in United states dollars and

cents would it approximately cost to have carried through
abandonment proceedings in the 1960s?
MR® CUNNINGHAM:

At the time, Your Honor, the cost

would not have been great.
QUESTION:

Why in the world do we have to bend all

the law around to protect a company with counsel who deliberatelydidn't file under the law?
MR® CUNNINGHAM:

Your Honor, Haring's failure to

file —
QUESTION:

I was willing to give you a break there

— it would cost you so much money — but you can't even help
me with that, can you?

30

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

It would not have been costly at

that time to file» Your Honor, for the reason that the Commis­
sion routinely processed the abandonment papers and did not hold
a formal hearing -•» an evidentiary hearing on it.
The Court of Appeals' observations were based on the
statement of facts which were contained in Opinion 740.

The

Commission, however, did more than state facts concerning good
faith.

It made an express finding in Paragraph 71 that McCombs

and Haring were nonwillful.

In view of Haring's testimony that

he was not merely ignorant of the requirement but that he con­
sulted his lawyer and both of them thought it was unnecessary
to file, I think that this holding is another way of saying
that the Respondents before the Commission were in good faith.
Moreover, the Administrative Law Judge made his own findings
of innocence and good faith, which were not accepted to and
in view of the Commission's regs —
QUESTION:

What happens if you, in complete innocence

and in good faith, fail to file your petition for certiorari in
this Court on time?

VJhat happens to you?

MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor —

In all the good faith in the world. What

happens?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Your Honor, you are out of court,

of course, but that's not the situation in this case.
QUESTION:

And I don't want to bend it over there,

31

either.
MRo CUNNINGHAM:

Well* we would ask Your Honor to

consider that Haring was in good faith in failing to file and
reasonably believed that it was not necessary to file,»

Whereas*

in Your Honor's situation* no one would believe ~~
QUESTION:

No.

Mine is that you thought you had

91 days and you only had 90.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Well* the statute very clearly sets

forth that you have 90 days* Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Misread the statute.

I've got to give

you all that good faith.
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I don't think* Your Honor -- and

I pointed out that the doctrine is not applicable to mere in™
advertence or ignorance* but rather it is applicable to a situ­
ation where the party reasonably believed that he didn't have
to file.
In this connection* if there is any doubt about
what the Administrative Law Judge thought about the subject*
it may be laid to rest by his statement on the record at the
conclusion of the proceedings* when speaking of the McCombs
group he said* "It is clear to me that there are equities in­
volved in this proceeding and that there are parties involved
in good faith and who proceeded in good faith* without knowledge
and without notice of the claim of United* until after they had
taken certain steps and actions and made various commitments

32

and entered into various contractual arrangements."
We* therefore* submit that the findings of the
Commission and of the Administrative Law Judge on the issue of
good faith are clear and are supported by substantial evidence.
QUESTION:

That said "without notice of United's

claim*" but does that say they didn't know what the statute
said* or that they didn't get a form that said you have to
file a petition of this kind?
MR„ CUNNINGHAM:

Without notice that United was

claiming rights under its contract., yes* Your Honor* which it
did not do until after the negotiations with United were over
and until a year after McCombs had entered into its contract
with duPont.
QUESTION:
in this case?

Isn't the statutory language pretty clear

Isn't that the big problem?

MR, CUNNINGHAM:

No* Your Honor* I don't think it

is clear* because If you examine the law at the time* you had
two cases which said -- that's the Hunt and the Harper cases
before the Fifth and Tenth Circuits* respectively — that the
requirement to continue deliveries continues down to the exhaustian of the reserves* or so long as production continues.
In light of that* I think that Haring could reason-»
ably have felt that he didn't have to file after it was clear
to him that there were no further reserves* and that the re­
serves which he had tried to produce were totally exhausted.

33
The second part of the two-»part analysis of this
equitable doctrine is;

What would have been the result had

the proper papers been filed at the proper time, l.e., when
Haring's reserves were depleted?

The Court of Appeals had no

doubt on this because it observed that "in the light of the
facts in 1966 the filing could only have been for the purpose
of tidying up the Commission’s records»"

The Commission, on

the other hand, refused to apply the Act retroactively, not
because of the facts as they existed in 1966, but rather
because of the facts as they existed in 1975 when the Commission
issued its order.

These facts were that in 1971 McCombs had

(?)

discovered the McKaskel field which lay at depths of approxi­
mately a mile deeper than the doufch Porter field from which
Haring had attempted to produce.
This is not like the situation in which an iron
mine which has known deposits becomes uneconomic because of
price fluctuations, but rather these were separate and unknown
reserves „
The Court of Appeals held that the Commission erred
in this respect as a matter of law, that is, the Commission
addressed the wrong evidence in applying the Act retroactively.
The Court was correct in this because the required finding under
Section 7(b) is that the available supply is depleted.

And the

facts are uncontradicted, as I mentioned, in 1966* that the
available supply of natural gas was depleted»

This finding was

34
correct in 1966 and is not erroneous today as the Commission
would suggest, with the benefit of hindsight.

For it remains

true today that in 1966, when the finding was required to be
made and the papers should have been filed, the available supply
of natural gas was depleted.
Therefore, we believe the court's opinion, properly
understood, holds that the Commission erred in failing retro­
actively to apply the Act,

This holding does not, as the

Commission and United suggest, bypass the Commission's processes
or deny interested parties the right to be heard.
As reflected in the Administrative Law Judge's
opinion, the Commission issued a notice of complaint on October
18, 1973# Inviting any party desiring to be heard to file a
petition to intervene or to protest.

McCombs raised the issue

of retroactive abandonment in its first admitted answer filed
at a date long before the hearings in this case, in this langu­
age:

"This Commission must treat that which should have been

done as having been done and should therefore issue an order
permitting Lewis H. Haring, et al„ to abandon their sale to.;
United as of the exhaustion of reserves in 1966.'4
QUESTION:

You may have already said this, but do you

know;of any case where the Commission actually has permitted
abandonment nunc pro tunc on its own or under mandate of a
court?
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

In the Hewitt and Dougherty case,

35
Your Honor, the Commission applied the Act as if Hewitt and
Dougherty had complied with the Act in 195** before the
Phillips case was decided*
Now* in view of McCombs' answer, at the hearings all
parties had opportunities to present evidence on this issue,and
yet the only evidence in the record was that of Haring and
McCombs that they were in good faith and that in 1966 the
available supply of natural gas was depleted*

Nor has this

bypassed the Commission's functions, for the reason that the
Commission was asked to exercise its powers under Section 7(b)
and failed to do so.
The Commission and United suggest that they have had
less than a full opportunity to cross-examine the evidence on
this issue.

And in response to this, I would point to the

record which contains extensive cross-examination of McCombs'
and Haring's witnesses before the Commission and the presenta­
tion by United of its own witnesses.
QUi&TION:

I've got another hypothetical,

Mr. Cunningham,
We've got a Commission in existence now that
everybody knows would not give an abandonment to anybody under
certain conditions.

So, wouldn't it be better not to apply

and wait for another Commission?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:
QUiiSTION:

No, Your Honor, because --

Why not?

36
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

the application of this doctrine

requires the producer to come to the Commission and to ask the
Commission to exercise its statutory function under Section
7(b).» as of the date the papers should have been filed.

Now,

in order to do that, the producer has to show that he was in
good faith.

Now* if the producer is conspiring to avoid -QUESTION:

If I would do what I suggest that I would

do, L/wouldn't tell anybody that was the reason I was doing it,
would I?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I would suggest that in that case.

Your Honor, the producer could not meet the required showing of
good faith and, therefore, the doctrine would not be applicable.
QUESTION:

.suppose ten years later I put on a lawyer

that said, "We just didn't think you needed abandonment,"
lawyers that said exactly what the lawyers said in this case;
would that be good?

\
\

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

Your Honor, it is a question of

good faith in each case.
QUESTION:

I said that the lawyers said exactly

what these lawyers said.

Wouldn't the Law Judge say exactly

what this Law Judge said, but not "You're wrong."
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

That the parties were innocent,

that is, and were in good faith?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

It would depend on the facts and

37
circumstances of that case.
QUESTION:

Well* the only — They should have applied

but they didn’t,
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

I don’t think that would meet the

required showing of good faith.
QUESTION:

What other requirements do you have here?

MR, CUNNINGHAM:
QUESTION:

Haring entered a 1966 --

All I heard you say was that the

lawyers said it wasn't necessary to file this piece of paper.
MR, CUNNINGHAM:
only reason,

No* Your Honor* that was not the

I think that supports Ha ring's good faith* but

Haring's good faith was based on the fact that he -- when he
acquired the Butler B lease* there was only one well on it
which was not producing.

He undertook extensive operations in

order to restore production which ended in failure.
QUESTION:

What about the fact that you can shop

around for Commissions?

Is that right?

Can't you wait until

you get a Commission that likes McComb?
MR, CUNNINGHAM:

Well* Your Honor* the required

finding is whether the available supply was exhausted as of
the time -«
QUESTION:

Haven't there been cases where they have

held up on Trade Commission cases until the whole Commission
changed* by delaying tactics?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:

I am not familiar with those cases*

38
Your Honor.
QUbhTIQN:

Why in the world do you think they have

passed a rule that you have to file for this, if you didn't
have to?
MR. CUNNINGHAM:
requirement.

It's the same as in any filing

It's the same as in.*-the Plaquemines case where

there was a filing requirement but the party was in good faith
by not making -- when he failed to make the required filing.
It is an equitable doctrine which excuses those filings where
it would be inequitable to enforce the requirements of the Act
against the party who is in good faith.
Further, I would point out that in this case the
application of the doctrine would impose the devastating
consequences of Haring's good faith failure upon McCombs, who
was totally innocent.
The Commission also. Your Honors, indicates that
something could have been added to these proceedings by the
filing of an abandonment application at the time of the hearings
below.
I believe this is unnecessary in view of the clear
answer which McCombs filed raising this issue.

And I would

further point to the Commission's regulations which contain the
Information required to be set forth in an abandonment appli­
cation.
items:

This is 250.7 of the Commission's regulations.

Ten

name of seller, name authorised in docket number, name

39
of purchaser* and the like*, all of which were in the record in
the proceedings below and all of which every party had an op­
portunity to cross-examine.
In summary on this point* Your Honors* the critical
Issue is whether the equities permit the devastating consequences
of Marines good faith failure to file to be visited on a totally
innocent third party* that is to say* McCombs,
The answer to this must be no.

The Court should

permit the application of the equitable doctrine which we have
urged here which is designed to prevent these inequities from
happening.

This application will not upset any regulatory

scheme or statutory function of the Commission* but rather it
is a matter of equitable principles addressed to these particu­
lar facts.
Your Honors* we also urge an issue which does in­
clude statutory interpretation* that is to say that the words
"service rendered*" as set forth in section 7(b) of the nature!
Gas Act* are to be accorded their plain meaning.

That is to say

a service is rendered when deliveries of natural gas are made
in interstate commerce and the public has thereby relied on
the reserves which support those deliveries,
VJe submit that reliance is at the heart of Section
7(b)* and therefore when Haring commenced deliveries from his
reserve the public relied on the reserves supporting those
deliveries and those deliveries were* therefore* within the

40

scope of section 7(b).

However* McCombs' reserves which were

almost a mile deeper and which were discovered at a later time
were not relied upon by the public and are therefore not within
the scope of dec felon 7(b)»
We submit that the decisions of the Court show that
neither the certificate nor the contract nor the oil and gas
lease is a proper measure of service rendered under Section 7(b).
And we would point out -- and this is not pointed out
in our brief — that the Natural Gas Act when it was first en»
acted contained Section 7(b) in tact* but it did not contain a
certificate provision except in very limited circumstances where
a natural gas company wanted to serve another market which was
already being served by another natural gas company.
So that* in our view* Congress did not intend the
certificate to be the measure of Section 7(b) because in the
original version of the Natural Gas Act there was no certificate
provision except for very limited circumstances.
We believe* Your Honors* that the pipe line companies “
right to purchase unknown reserves upon which the public has not
relied was* therefore* intended by Congress to be left to the
gas purchase contract under state law.
Tha t c onelud es my a rgumenfc.

41

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. ALLEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO, 78-249
MR» ALLEN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There is no basis whatever in law or in fact for
Respondents' claim that their alleged, quote, "good faith1
requires the Commission to grant them nunc pro tunc abandonment.
Their claim of-, quote, "good faith" comes down, even if you
accept it to be true, simply to an ordinary mistake of law.
As Justice Marshall pointed out, if your lawyer tells you you
don't have'to file a petition for certiorari on time or you
don't have to get a driver's license, or you don't have to do
anything else that statutes require you to do, that is no
excuse for not doing it.

The statutory requirements remain in

force.
Furthermore, there is no basis for Respondents'
suggestion that it is difficult for producers to find out
whether the Commission has certificated particular gas sales
contracts.

As Mr, Bemls has pointed out, the contracts are

typically recorded in the Recorder of Deeds Office and any
person searching a title will find the contract and have no
difficulty going to the pipe line to determine or to the
Commission to determine whether there is a certificate author­
izing that service and whether there has been an abandonment
order issued -with respect to it.

42

QUESTION:
Office»

You said recorded in Recorder of Deeds

You mean county by county?
MR, ALLEN:
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

I believe that's correct, yes.
Under what heading?
They are filed with the lease.

The lease

must be filed and typically a gas sales contract will be filed
together with the lease to reflect an encumbrance on the lease.
The cases that Respondents rely on for their alleged
good faith argument -QUESTION:

I didn't understand him to say the court

had to buy his argument,

His argument was that the court could

buy it,
MR. ALLEN:

His argument is* as I understand it*

the Commission is required, as a matter of law, and was re­
quired in this case*
QUESTION:
MR, ALLEN:
QUESTION:

But he says the court can do that,
The court can require the Commission,
I think it is a little different than

saying the court has to.
MR, ALLEN:

Well, it is not entirely clear what his

position is, but if he says that's the law, then presumably the
court would have to.
The cases on which he relies are completely dis­
tinguishable.

They involve either of two situations.

The

first situation is where somebody, has failed to comply with

43
statutory requirements and in order to make sure he doesn't get
away with evading his statutory obligations, the Commission has
to make an assumption that what he did -- he did* in fact* what
he should have done.
The other situation is where a person does not do
something in a reasonable reliance on the existence of the state
of law at that time and then subsequently there is a Ghange in
the state of law.

For example., in 1954 when this Court first

determined and held that producer contracts were subject to
the Natural Gas Act — producer activities.

4

"

If there are no further questions* Your Honors —
QUESTION:

Is Hewitt and Dougherty in that latter

category?
MR. ALLEN:

That is in that latter category where

there had been a cessation of production before 1954* and,
of course* the person didn't file for an abandonment application
because nobody thought he was subject to the Act.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon* at 1:32 o'clock* p.m.* the ease was
submitted.)
