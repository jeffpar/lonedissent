MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

We’ll pursue

it, Mr. Sikora.
You may proceed.
MR. SI KORA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the Court:
This is a procedural due process case.

It arises

from a section 1983 clast: action challenge to the Massachusetts

5
w 5

implied consent highway safety law,
It comes to this Coart on direct appeal from a
decision of a three-judge district court holding that law
unconstitutional on its face.
Implied consent laws, in fore© in all 50 states,
typically provide that a person arrested ©n a charge of drunken
driving must submit t© a chemical or breath analysis test or
else accept a temporary license suspension for hi® refusal
of that test»
The general question presented today is whether
the states must provide a driver with a hearing at which he
can dispute the facts of his refusal prior to the suspension
of his license,
After describing th© operation of the Massachusetts
law and the particular facts —
QUESTION?
MR» SI KORA s
QUESTIONS

Is it a refusal to take the test?
Y<as, Your Honor,
It was my understanding from fell© record,

though I realise I say b© wrong, that the appellee in this
case had actually requested the test himself,
MR, SIKOR&s

Ho requested it .subsequent to refusing

it, upon his arrival initially at th© station,
QUESTION;

He refused the first one, and about

15 minutes late* asked for it,
ohoitfs?

Wasn0t that what the record

MR» SIKORA;
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor,
22 minutes?

22 minutes later,

But it was 50 minutes after

the ©vents»
MR, SIKORA:

That6s correct.

52 minutes after the

accident, and 22 minutes after the arrival at the station.
The police did refuse it.11 His attorney in tha
interim had arrived at the station and had consulted with the
driver, and apparently, there was a change of mind.
QUESTION;

How much difference does 22 minutes

make in the effectiveness ©£ th© t©st?
MR, SIKORA;

It's hard to say, Your Honor.

Soma

states have suggested that 30 minutes is a reasonable block
of time from the arrival at th© station house.
However, sine® that would vary according to the time
it had taken to get to tie station house from, th© scene of the
accident, it's very difficult t© say, at least with any
scientific knowledge, what time span readers the test, in
effect, inaccurate.

accident must it be taken for it to be effective?

QUESTION;

Didn't the second time — the state

refused to give him the test? is that right?
MR. SIKORA:
QUESTION;
MR. SIKORA:

That's correct.
Why?
The police officers apparently mad® a

judgment that the time span now, between the moment of arrest
and the moment of request had become too long for an accurate
reading.
That, at least, was their subjective judgment.
QUESTIONs

I thought, that was what

my brother

Blackmm's question was, as to how long is it before a reading
will not be any good.
MR. SIKORA:

I don't think ms can say with any

scientific objectivity to the Court with any information from
the record that we know of a precis© times.
It does appear that the polio© in this ease, in
their judgment, mad© a judgment call that 52 minutes was to©
long o

QUESTION:

So the final judgment in this case was

52 minutas after, the government said, we won't give you the
test.
MR. SIKORA:

52 minutes after the accident the police

refused the test.
QUESTION:

Refused to test him, and as a result ©f

that h® lost hi.s license

MR. SIKORA:

They had originally offered it 30

miniates after the test, and he refused.
QUESTION;

Does the record tell us whether

the

police will delay long enough to let the driver call an attorney
and ask for advice?
MR. SIKORA;

The record does not, Your Honor.

I would think again that there8 s an irreducible amount
of police discretion.

If an attorney arrived soon after an

individual same to feh® station, chances might be better,
QUESTION;

Would it b© a refusal, for example, for a

driver feo say, I9d like to call my lawyer before I take the
test.

And then, say, take maybe 25 minutes talking t© the

lawyer on the phone, and than com© back and say, yes, 1311

It would not b© a refusal.

I think -- it

would be ®n accommodation.
QUESTION;

It's pretty much what happened here,

isn't it?
MR. SIKORA;

No, he outright refused the test at

first.
QUESTION;

But if h©sd just said, I don't want fe©

d© it until I talk to my lawyer, and than take 25 minutes to

9

get the legal advice.
MR. SIKORA:

I sea.

I think the key factor is

always going to be the length of time between the accident
and the —
QUESTION:

So if it takes 25 minutes to get legal

advice, that's a refusal?
MR. SIKORA:
QUESTION:

I would think so.
Is it possible that as a medical matter,

as a scientific matter, that it might make a difference
not only in the lapse of time but whether he'd had a pint of
bourbon or a quart of bourbon ox* only two ounces of bourbon.
Two ounces might reasonably -- the manifestations
of two ounces might, disappear fromthe bloodstream much more
quickly than a pint or a quart.
MR. SIKORA:

My instinct is to agree with that,

assessment your Honor.
The •— and perhaps that is his one more good reason
for drawing hard and fine lines in this situation and perhaps
having a time limit.
I must concede that -the police here war© operating
without hard time

limits, and that they mad© a subjective

judgment about the driver's condition in refusing the test
when he requested it after 52 minutes from the accident.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in tee record where the

police explained this?

10

MR, SIKORA:

10

QUESTION:
time?

Ka, Your Honor,
Why they did not give him the second

Nothing;in the record on that,
MR, SIKORA:

No* Your Honor,

I couldnBt find ifc,
And that brings me*

perhaps* to one.of the pervasive features of this case.

And

the case would be very respectable as applied challenge to til®
statute because these facts show that the administration of the
statute was not efficient.
However* the plaintiff has chosen* and has actually
foregone opportunity to press an as-applied argument* and
has chosen to attack the statute on its face* saying that in
all situation* the statute is unconstitutional.
The performance of the police end the registrar
her© is not typical* we submit.

The parties have washed out

in a statement of the agreed facts* many of the particular
equities of the case* and have decided to focus on the major
issue of whether a hearing must invariably b© prior rather
than subsequent.
After describing the operation of the Massachusetts
law and the particular facts of this case* we argue that the
statute does satisfy due process under Idle Court’s three
measurements fer a prior hearing.
Those are: the v&lu© of th@ private interest taken
by the government

here * a driver’s license ? the risk of a

mistake in the taking ©f the interest without a prior hearing;

11
>7 11

and the public purpose for which the government is acting.
The Massachusetts law requires the police officer
arresting the person for driving under the influence to offer
that person a chemical breath—-a chemical or breath analysis
test3

The officer must inform the driver that the refusal

©f the test will result in a 90-day lie?©rtsa suspension.
If the ds?lv@r still refuses the test, the officer
must immediately prepare a written report of refusal»

This is

possibly another factor in the police reluctance t© give the
driver & second chance if they do immediately perform that
paperwork, they must at least threw it away or back up
and do the paperwork ©gain.
The police officer receiving the refusal must sign
it under the penalty ©£ perjury, and he must forward it to
the registrar of motor vehicles immediately„
In turn, the registrar must impose the90-day
suspension by immediate notice, directing the driver t©
surrender his license at the local registry office.
There is so discretion left la the joints of the
statute o

Each of these requirements i® mandatory.
At the time ©£ the surrender, the driver can,

request an immediate hearing to dispute his refusal of the
test.

That hearing will begin ©ra the gams day as surrender

if at all possifcla.
In this particular ©as®, Donald Montrym9s car

collided with a motorcycle»

About 15 minutes after the

accident police arrived,, arrested him, and charged him
among other offenses with driving while intoxicated»
They accompanied him to the station house, and at
that point we had the initial refusal, and an officer executed
the report of the refusal»
Montrym claims that his refusal was not Informed»
He says that he was not Informed of the suspension penalty
arid refused on that ground»
The remaining facts are undisputed»
escesut© the report»

Police did

The registrar suspended Montrym»

And

subsequently a state trial court dismissed the drunken driving
charge on the ground that the police had refused his
subsequent request»
(tontrym's attorney informed the main office of the

registrar o'f the Court result»

The registrar answered that the

license had already been suspended and must be surrendered»
Montrym did surrender the license, but for some reason did
not request a surrender day hearing»
Instead, he took an administrative appeal from fell©
suspension, but, before the completion of the administrative
process filed the present class action»
QUESTIONt

Well, what sort of administrative appeal

did h® take?
MR» SXKORAs

Within 10 days from any action of feh@

hearing before a board of appeal presiding over the registrar's
action,,

That board in turn will schedule a hearing.
Here, Montrym would have had a hearing several

weeks into his suspension.

One was scheduled when he brought

this action.
QUESTION?

Did h© ask for that sort of a hearing?

MR. SIKORA:
QUESTION;

Ha did.
And is there any review of that board's

findings?
MR. SIKORA;

Yes, Your Honor,

There's review by fch©

MR. SIKORA:

Yes, sir.
Would that have resulted almost

automatically in th© administrativa appeal resulting in the

restoration of his license*
MR, SIKORAs

We think so.

More importantly, we think a same--day hearing
would have had the asms result.

The law and custom is that when there's

MR. SIKORAs

Yes, there was driving under the

influence, driving to endanger, and driving without a license.
QUESTION:

Well, 1-at me just follow this up for a

moment„
If what you5re telling me correctly reflects the
state practice,, it means that a driver has a right when he
comes to the station, refusa, wait 20 minutes, and say, now
I5d like to take an exculpatory test.

If they don't give it

fee him, he has a right —* they ean8t suspend

his license.

That's what you're telling me is the custom, as I
understand it.
MR. SIKORA:

The custom, I think, Your Honor is that

denied a fair test ~

QUESTION:

But you’re telling me that as a matter

©f Massachusetts8 law on this record there was no refusal and
that8s why the statute is unconstitutional as applied in this
case „
There was n© refusal because there was a subsequent
request for an exculpatory test which the police denied which
vitiated the initial refusal.

That’s eerreet.
So the question of when a refusal takes

place is not really just a yes or no question in all circumstances?

19

MR. SIKORA;

No* it's a very circumstantial question*

Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

It's a question that's left entirely to

the discretion of the police as a pre-suspensidn matter.
MR. SIKORAs

Initially to the police and ultimately

to a ferial judge.

If there was no

by the Massachusetts court, why could he make any attack on

So that th© question presented in your

brief, whether a statist© imposing a uniform, temporary

It did, Your Honor»
And that's what before us?
That5® ©orrest.
It's your position that that's all that's

before usj that‘'a your position?
MR. SIKORAs

That's correct.

The partias 1st the district court have analysed
this case under the three prior hearing criteria announced

■

cw 22

22

in Matthews v„ Eldridge and applied in Dixon v. hove.
The first factor is the magnitv.de of the private
interest»

Since

Burs on it has been settled that a

person5® interest in a driver's license requires some kind of
hearing for its deprivation»
However, fch@ timing and the thoroughness of the
hearing vary

according to the risk of error and the strength

of the public purpose s©rv©d by a license suspension»
In Dixon, the court concluded that the license
interest was not so great as to require us to depart from the
ordinary principle established by our decision that something
less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior t© an
adverse administrative action®
The court went on fe© weight the chance of error and
the public interest served by the Illinois habitual offender
law and decided that a subsequent hearing, typically one more
than 20 days after suspension, was constitutionally sufficient
for the usual driver in Illinois»
By contrast, the Massachusetts system affords a
hearing opportunity often able to begin on the same day as the
license surrender*
Even if on® takes the pessimistic view of the driver#s
briaf that a complete hearing opportunity will consume 7 t©
10 days of the suspension time, the figure is drastically
less than the post-suspension time permitted in Dixon.

23
The second factor in the court's decisions has been

23

the risk of an erroneous license suspension.

The Massachusetts

statute builds in a number of safeguards against this possibility.
An. officer must offer the test and inform the driver
of the 90-day suspension for its refusal in the presence of a
witness.

Upon refusal, he must immediately execute under

penalties of perjury the report of refusal, which must in turn
set out probable cause for the original arrest, the fact of the
arrest, and the driver's refusal of the test.
In addition, the witnessing.officer and the superior
officer to whom he is accountable must endorse the report
before its transmission to the registrar.
QUESTION:

What was there about the appellee's

conduct at the time ofthe accident that prompted the officers
to say you should taka the test?
\

MR. SIKORA:

There were fpur symptoms, Your Honor.

There was the odor of alchohol? the glassy eyes? slurred
speech? and one, in particular, the final one, was that his
footing was so shaky that ha had to hold on to a street sign
to maintain his balance.
QUESTION:

Now does the statute require some kind of

probable cause before the officer may require or suggest that
he take the test?
MR. SIKORA:

It does.

The arrest, the underlying

arrest, must be a valid arrest before the test is put fcothe

24

kw 24

individual,,
QUESTION:

That is the main

W© think it88 mitigated by

first, the relative speed and thoroughness

of the surrender hearing.

We think that it comes usually more

quickly than seven to tan days.
Secondly, we haves the same kind of public safety

And finally, the magnitude of the deprivation, again,
a seven to ten day deprivation as against a 20 or more day
deprivation in Dixon^ v. Lovs.

Does the statute require that it be

completed in seven to ten days?
I don't find the statutory description of the

MR. SIKORA;

It does not, Your Honor.

It — the
It is

stipulated by the parties that in administering the statute

29

lew 29

the registrar had set up this same-day process.
QUESTIONS

And the seven to ten days results from

the fact that sometimes you have to allow time for the police
officer to come in and tell the other side of the story, I
suppose.
MR. SIKQRAs

That's correct.

This particular — the surrender hearing is particularly
suited to correct obvious mistakes.

And we submit that this

case was a paradigm example of an obvious mistake.
It is going to take a few extra days if there are
serious issues about probabis cause, and police must be
cross-examined.

But feh© process, the seven day to ten day

process, is practically ass adjudicatory process, an
evidentiary process .

It is not simply an' opportunity for the

driver to tell his sid© @£ the story or ask for a break.
QUESTIONS

Let me ask you a rather basic ~ how would

the state interest suffer if instead of this procedure they
said — if made a rul® t© show cause, so that if you show up
in five days or six days, whatever, at the hearing officer9a
office, and unless you have good cause for saying there was
no refusal or no probable cause, your license be suspended.
And then y@u had the same ~ everything els©
exactly the same.

How would the state interest suffer if you

did ife that way?
MR. SIKQRAs

W© think that very few people would

30

30

take the test; and that everyone would seek the hearing.
When the statute was enforced, approximately one out
of three people arrested for drunken driving still resisted
the test and we think that that percentage would —
QUESTION:

Why — you mean they would refuse the

tost because of the fact they8 re going to keep their license
for five days instead of having it suspended forthwith?
MR. SIKORA: "No, I think they — there's a reflexive
reaction to the inculpatory nature of the test»

If someone

is marginally intoxicated and confronts the breathalyzer, I
think there is a reflexive resistance to it and hope that in
some way, with an intervening hearing, they will be able to
ward

off any kind of suspension.

is it's going to be suspended definitely for at least three

That8 s right.
Why wouldn't it be equally definite

as far as the 90-day suspension if you just say, well, we
won't have the suspension take effect until the same-day hearing?
And most people, I suppose, don't have any real
answer if they refuse, they refuse.
MR. SIKORA:

I think it's the immediacy and the

certainty of the suspension that haves —

Jew 31

QUESTIONS

The difference between immediately and

three days later?
MR, SIKORAs

Well, hopefully three days later.

But

I think the typical driver is going to feel that if he can
avoid the test for the time being, and its incriminating
evidence, and com© up with some kind of help before he shows
up for a hearing, he will somehow be able to avoid drunken
driving charges,
QUESTION?

The hearing officer raay be more lenient

than the police officert 1 suppose,

Possibly,

But it°s the immediacy, its

the fact that you are suspended immediately that we think is
crucial,

AFTERNOON SESSION
11:01 p.m.J
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Hagopian, you may

proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. HAGOPIAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HAGOPIAN:

Good afternoon, Your Honor; may it

please the Court:
I would like initially to straighten out some of the
facts in this case before proceeding with my argument.
First of all, Mr» Montrym was stopped at 8:30
p,n. ©n tha evening in question, and he was brought to the
police station at 8:45»

At that time he refused the breathalyzer.

His attorney showed up five ©r ten minutes later»

And at 9:05

he alleges in his affidavit that he wanted to taka the
breathalyser tost, which was, at the most, 35 minutes fromthe
time of the accident, and approximately 20 minutes from his
initial refusal.
Now —
QUESTION:

1 calculated on the record as precisely

30 minutes, but it doesn’t make all that much difference.
MR» HAGOPIAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

But there was soma talk about 52 minutes here when
my brother was up here this morning, and I wanted to clarify
that»

That clearly is out of the question.
From the time of the accident — not the time when

33
33

he was first asked about the breathalyser test? there are
statutes in other jurisdictions that hold up to 30 minutes
from the time that the person is read his rights.
Montrym was within that.

And clearly

Because at least according to the

findings of fact by the district court judge, thatas the
first point that I wanted to clarify»
QUESTION;

How is that before us, whan you only
I

are interested in on the face?
MR, HAGOPIAN;
Honor,

Well, I donet think it is, Your

But I want fco point out that this man —
QUESTION;

Your case, you have withdrawn everything

except on the face?
MR, HAGOPIAN %
as-applied.

Oh, no, Your Honor,

We still reserve

I mean, ifc9s conceivable the statute —

QUESTION:

Where did yon reserve it?

MR. HAGOPIAN;

Well-, when we brought our original

motion for summary judgments I believe w@ asked the court to
examine both questions, the Issus of constitutionality on its
face, because it was a class action, and as applied to Mr.
Montrym.
There was a case last term that was handed down by
this Court that held that if © man do©@net ©t least ©olorably
assert a claim ©£ Innocence, feh© fact that his procedural
due process rights are violated is not an independent claim.
That was a per curiam opinion.

AM I don9fe know what the

34
cikw 34

implications of that opinion are.
But we want to clearly assert that Mr. Montrym
was innocent.

He is asserting a claim of innocence in this

particular case.

He was an innocent man,, and that’s what the

due process clause
QUESTION s

You question the fast that 'the state

refused to give him the test?
MR. HAGOPXAN;
QUESTIONS

You abandon that?

MR. HAGOPXAN:
QUESTION:

Well ~

Did you abandon it in the lower court?

MRa HAGOPXAN:
QUESTION:

He was refused — the state did —

Have you abandoned that point ©r not?

MR. HAGOPXAN:
QUESTXON:

No.

He initially —

Because the ©pinion in the lower court,

the judgment says, the statute is unconstitutional ©n its
face.
MR. HAGOPXAN:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

As far

as I'm concerned, Montrym8s ease is irrelevant to th© -- at
least on a facial attack, it is irrelevant, other than the
fact that he asserts a claim @£ innocens©.
Whether ha was innocent ©r not is irrelevant,
QUESTION:

Mr. Hagopi&n, unless 1 wholly misapprehend

th© issue in this ©as©, this statute doesn’t have any tilling
t© do with guilt or innocence, but merely about — has t@

35
w 35

do with whether or not he refused or didn't refuse to take a
breathalyzer taste
MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTIONs

That's correct. Your Honor,

Nothing about guilt or innocence.

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Just that fact.

MR. HAGOPIAN:

Well, when I say innocent, I didn't

mean innocent of the substantive crime.

I meant innocent

of the fact that h© didn't refuse.
QUESTION:

Well, if he didn't refuse to take the

test, then the statute is wholy inapplicable to him.
MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

That's •—

That's correct, is it not?

MRo HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct, yes it is.

Right.

MR. HAGOPIAN:
that back, Your Honor.

Well, I'm not so ■— excuse me, I take
No, that's not true.

Because the

police officer alleged *—■ whan the police officer sent the
report to the registry, that's what created the cause of
action in this case.

The police officer asserted that he

refused t© take the test.
QUESWION:

And ™

Excuse me.

That's the whole point of your

attack, isn't it, that even if he did not refuse, if a police
officer says ho does, and he never gets a hearing on it, the
statute causes him fe@ lose his license?

36

;v 36

MR. HAGQPIAN:
QUESTION:

That's why you say it's unconstitutional?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Yes it was, Your Honor.

In your favor?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION;

That's right.

This was decided on summary judgment?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.

Yes.

So that all doubts as to facts had to

be resolved in favor of the state, I taka it.

In other words,

affidavits filed on your behalf had to be disbelieved?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

That's correct, except to the extent

that there was unagreed statement of fact that was filed by
the parties, and that's in the appendix, and that's quite
extensive„
QUESTION:

Then those are the facts that we should

go by.
MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

But anything outside; the agreed statement

of facts is contained only in an affidavit submitted in
support of your client we must treat, as having been resolved
adversely to your client.
MR. HAGOPIAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And I

don't believe there were any at all of these affidavits
outside of the agreed statement of fact.
were any other affidavits.

I don't believe there

I think that’s correct,

37
37

There were none.
So that the case was heard on an agreed statement
of facts? at least the motion for summary judgment was.
QUESTIONS

Well, that's why wei:re curious as to why

MR. HAGOPXAN:

Well, the affidavit was in the state

QUESTIONS

Well, was that in the agreed statement

MR. HAGOPXAN s

that into th© agreed statement ©f facts.

And so that is in

the record t© ’shat ©actent®
QUESTIONS

Well, was it agreed in the sans© that -the

state agreed that that’s what transpired in the state court?
Or —
MR. HAGOPXANs
QUESTIONs

No, it certainly was not.

The state didn't agree —

MR. HAGOPXANs

Well, they agreed that we had the

record fromthe state court proceedings, and they agreed t© the
veracity instead of submitting certified copies.

But there

were affidavits ia th© pleadings infche state courts, and X
don't believe that they ever agreed to tie truth of the

But they certainly agreed to the fact that -the

So I think there8s a clear inference that the trial

MR® HAGOPIAN:

I think it's

QUESTIONs

You didn't abandon it in the•lower courts?

MR. HAGOPIAN:

NOj, absolutely not.

What do we do if we disagree withthe

district court's conclusion that it's unconstitutional on its

Do we decide

as applied t® him.

And my brothers have not taken any appeal from that

order certifying the class action.

They don't seem to have

aver challenged the fact that the district court judge held
that Montrym's case was typical of the class.
QUESTION:

What is the class?

MR. HAGOPIAN:

The class comprises all those

motorists in Massachusetts who have a driver's license who
refused to take a breathalyser test —
QUESTION:

Where is it in this record?

MR. HAGOPIAN:

It's in tlie opinion, four Honor.

QUESTION: ''Well, it8s 16(a), and it isn't at all

MR. HAGOPIAN:

That6s not correct.

He was

never given an opportunity.
QUESTIONS

I thought he want into the district

court after he had had his opportunity for a hearing bafore
the registrar's?
MR. HAGOPIANs
QUESTION?

Yes, that's correct.

Than how can this be a class in this

action?
MR. HAGOPXAN:

Well, Your Honor, if the point is —

let me see if I can explain to you.

Let me just give you

briefly two minutes of procedure so you can understand what
the problem is here.
When the police officer takes this report, ha sends
it to the registrar.

The registrar automatically revokes

his license, and that's what happened in Montrym3s case.
Montrym surrendered his license, but he did not
he insisted that —- ha always maintained that the registrar
could not — that that suspension was illegal, because ©f the
fact that he was not granted a hearing prior.
And that's what the class constitutes.

All those

people who the registrar sends a notice to, suspends their
license without giving them that hearing first.

And that83

the central issue in this case.
He insists upon that hearing first.

As it turned

out, Your Honor, thca registrar was well informed of the
facts in -this case.

The attorney that represented Mr. Montrym

in the district court*. Mr. Harrison,, whose with me here today,,
he sent the registrar, before the registrar ever sent the
notice to Montrym, a copy ©f the district court’s judgment.
And he said, Mr. Montrym never refused to take the
breathalyser.

Har©9s the findings of fact inth® district

courts when the district court in Massachusetts, criminal
court, has ruled that Montrym did not refuse fc@ take the
breathalyser test, you should not take his license, and Iem
sending you this letter t© avert his license revocation.
And th© registrar just totally ignored that.

And

he says, as far as I'm concerned, I have n© discretion under
the statute.

When I get this notice from fch© police department

that says Montryra refuses, as far as I’m concerned I suspend
the license and that's it.

I don’t

not interested in

anything else.
If you want t© come in and talk t© me afterwards,
IBd

be very happy to talk to you about, it.
As it so happened, even after he suspended the

license, I sent him a demand, and demanded the return of that
license, and sent in the district court — and I explained to
him about the breathalyzers
after that

so he well knew tee facts even

stage, but he refused to return that license.
QUESTIONS

You also appealed

MR. HAGOPIANs

The only time he returned it was when

the United States district court ordered him to, and then

43
kw 43

it took hiss seven days to return it after the date of the
order.
QUESTION;

You also appealed from the registrar t©

That was on toe initial

Thera vras an appeal taken,

probable cans© for his arrest, and if in fact he refuses to
take the breathalyser — they must prove all three elements,
and they’re complicated elements-- then if and only if the

But . if he had taken this copy of the

dismissal and --MR. 11AGO?I AN:
QUESTION:

He did.

— after that first hearing — he did

do that?
MR. HAGOPXAN:
QUESTION:

He --

To the first hearing that was available

to him?
MR. HAGOPIAM:

He said — and it's stipulated inthe

agreed statement of facts, Your Honor —- that the record in
the district court proceedings was sent to the registrar
before he revoked Mr. Montrym*s license, and toe registrar
totally ignored it.
In fact, he wrote back — when Mr. Harris

sent

47
3kw 47

hira a copy of the district court record, he wrote Mr» Harris
back five days after ha had, in fact, revoked Mr. Montrym's
license.

And that letter is on page 46 of the — 48, page

48 of the appendix.

In reference to your letter of June 2nd

concerning the above named, this is to advise you that his
license has already bean suspended and said license must be
returned to this office immediately.
The registrar's position is quite clear, Your Honor,
in this case, that when he gets that letter from the police
department saying that a motorist has refused to take the
breathalyzer test, he has absolutely no discretion but to
revoke the license upon receipt of that letter.
And that is the issue.
is not binding on the registrar.

The. district court's finding
The district court may have

dismissed this case for a number of reasons.
to make those specific findings of fact.

He happened

He may construe

the statute different that the registrar.
There's no Massachusetts case law on this particular
issue.

He may construe the statute differently.

He may

disagree with the district court judge.
I don't know whether the district court judge was
right or whether he was wrong on this case.
Now, I would like to point out too, Your Honor,
this morning that notice of revocation that was sent to Mr.
Montrym, which is a standard form by the registrar, says you

48
w 48

must cease operating your motor vehicle immediately.

There

is nothing in that notice, which is in the appendix, that
advises the motorist that he has a right to an immediate
hearing.
And I do concede that in the agreed statement tnat
he can, as a practical matter, walk into the registrary and
get an immediate hearing.

But he's not notified of that in the

notice that goes out to the motorist, and a copy of that
notice is one page 45.
QUESTION:

Your client had his own lawyer, then?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Your client had his own lawyer?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon, Your Honor?

He knew —- he — there's no lawyer —

So why does he need other notice?

He's

got a lawyer to tell him what the lav; is.
MR. HAGOPIAN:

Well, I don't even know if his own

counsel knew about that fact, Your HOnor.

There's nothing in

the registry regulations that publishes that you can get an
immediate hearing.
As a practical matter, Mr. Harris sent a letter
immediately to —
QUESTION:
know the law.

All right, then, you aren't required to

I assume that that’s the law in Massachusetts,

that the lawyers-, are not required to know the law; then I
agree with you.

49
MR. HAGOPIAN;

dkw 4 9

QUESTION:

Yeah, I don’t.

That laymen are not required.

MR. HAGOPIAN:

The right to an immediate hearing is

not, Your Honor, part of the law.

That's something by custom

that the registry gives,
I know of no regulations, written regulations,
that they've ever promulgated to that effect.
As a practical matter, if you've ever had any
experience with the registry as an attorney, you would know
that.

I know that, and I knew it.

But I don't know that

all lawyers who live in the country know that.
QUESTION:

But they're bound to, aren't they?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Are they bound to know that?

They are bound to know that.

MR. HAGOPIAN;

Well, it’s custom, Your Honor.

I

don't -- you know, I *—
QUESTION:

Unless ,/e've changed that ancient

axiom of the law.
QUESTION:

If the law provided for notice, would

that meet your complaint?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

Well,

it certainly would help ~ no,

I
QUESTION:

Wait a minute.

Would it meet it, or do

you want something else?
MR. HAGOPIAN;

No

I want something else besides

50

that,
QUESTION:

What else do you want?

MR, HAGOPIAN:

Well,, I think they've got to give taa

hearing before they take the license,
QUESTION:

Well, I understood you to say that by

custom at least if one knew about the opportunity the
registrar would allow him to appear and to state his side of
the case,
MR, HAGOPIAN:
first, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

But why should he lose his license

That's the issue in the case,
Does ha lose his license before the

registrar acts?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

That's right.

That's the bottom

line issue in this case.
QUESTION:

I thought the registrar was -(die one who

deprived him of his license?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

He does.

And I'm saying that he

should have a hearing before the registrar takes that action.
What ho can — what the registrar should do, that
h© does in hundreds of other cases. Your Honor, pursuant to
the statutory scheme in that—
QUESTION:

I think you should wait a minute until the

questions are asked.
MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor,

Because his question was:

Gould the

registrar relieve him of his license immediately?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

He does, in fact, take his license

immediately.
QUESTION;

When he refuses to take the test?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

The registrar takes it?

MR. HAGOPIAN;
QUESTION:

That's correct.

As soon as he gets the ~-

How in the world can he do that?

He's in

an entirely different city, isn’t he?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

He sends a notice.

As soon as he

gets the notice —
QUESTION;

Well, but I mean he can’t do it until he

gets the notice, can ha?
MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

Well, that was the question.

MR. HAGOPIAN:

Well, I’m sorry.

I didn’t, understand

it that way.
QUESTION:

Well, why don’t you wait and then get

the question.
QUESTION:

The registrar gets the notice.

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Then he’s in a position to act unless the

individual charged appears and gives some reasons why that
shouldn’t be done.
MR. HAGOPIAN:

Weil, by statute he’s required to act,

52
w 52

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Wall, X thought you said that custom

accorded an individual a right to be heard before the
registrar.
MR. HAGOPIAN:
notice goes out.

After the revocation.

After the

Then he, by custom, he can get an immediate

hearing.
QUESTION:
you made it clear.

You know, Mr. Hagopian, I don't think
There’s a time interval between the

revocation, which can be done by mail, and the turning in of
the physical piece of paper ■—
MR. HAGQPXAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

— which may be a few days later.

It's

the later date he gets the hearing.
MR. HAGOPIAN:

That's right.

And he can't drive in

the meantime, either, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

That's the heart of your case, and you're

not making it till clear.
MR. HAGOPIAN:

He cannot drive — the minute he gets

the notice he has to cease and desist.

He then physically

has to get that notice —
QUESTION:

And you also -- areyou not contending

that before he gets the notice he has absolutely no right to
appear before the magistrate or whatever he's called?
MR. HAGOPIAN;

That's right.

The registrar.

53
That's correcta Your HOnor.

53

Has absolutely no

right.
And even if he does, which is what happened in
Monfcrym’s case through his attorney, the registrar didn't pay
any attention to him.

Because the registrar has no discretion

under the statute.
QUESTION:

Do I understand you that if you're arrested

for a traffic violation, you can't immediately go before the
magistrate?

Immediately?

MR. HAGOPIAN:

I'm not sure I understand that question

You mean before the registrar —
QUESTION:

Whan you are arrestesd for a violation —•

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

— under the traffic code of Massachusetts

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Right.

Yes.

-- can't you go directly before a

magistrate then and there, if one's available?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

You mean for trial your HOnor on

criminal charges?
QUESTION:

Or to say how do you do to him.

You said

you can't even go to him.
MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

I said to the magistrate.

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

You can't go to the registrar.

Yes.

He cango to the magistrate, can’t he?

54
,w 54

MR. HAGOPIAN:

He can go to a lower court, lower

criminal court; that5s correct, Your Honor.
But the issue of whether he takes tne breathalyzer
will not usually come up in that proceeding, in the criminal
proceeding.
QUESTION:

You9re sure of that?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

How are you sure of that?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
grounds for a mistrial.

Because it's inadmissible.

It's

In fact, if the police introduced the

fact that -QUESTION:

You mean if a magistrate says, I don’t

think this man is drunk, and turns him loose, he can't do
that?
MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Ha can do that?

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

»Yes .

I thought so.

MR. HAGOPIAN:

But the registrar will still revoke

his license, even if he's found not guilty.
QUESTION:

I'm not talking about that.

MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, I understand that.

I5m talking about the first part, which

you said he couldn't do.
MR. HAGOPIANs

Well, let me say in general, Your

55
55

Honor*, the criminal proceedings do not come before the
registry actions»

This is an unusual case in that sense.

Usually the criminal proceedings come after the registry
revoked.
So this is a rare case to have a criminal proceedings
before the registrar takes his action.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hagopian, let me ask you a question:

Would you challenge the constitutionality of the statute
if it worked inthis way, if the police sent a notice and
simultaneously

sent it to the person arrested and also to the

registrar, which said, in substance, on such and such a date,
your license will be revoked.
to object if you wish to.

You may appear at that time

If you don't, it will be automatically

revoked.
Would you have any objection to that statute?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

No.

In fact, that’s’ the procedure

that3s used —
QUESTION:

All you're really talking about is the

suspension ~ the fact that there's an automatic suspension
for the interval of time between the notice to the magistrate
and the time that he can go in and demand a hearing.

And

you say that would be all right if there was a notice of what
they proposed to do rather than the fact that it was already —
MR. EAGQPIAN:

That's correct.

And that’s —■ that

procedure is in existence in Massachusetts by the registry

56
vi 56

in several other statutes.

And I’ve pointed that out in my

brief.
He sends a 14-day notice, and he says, I intend
to revoke your license in 14 days.

If you object to it, you

can come in and have a hearing before the 14

days.

And

that procedure is used in thousands of cases.
QUESTION:

Well, he gives the grounds on which he

proposes to revoke the license.
MR. HAGOPIAN:

Oh, yes.

Yes, he does.

Yes, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And inthis case it would be because

of your refusal to take a breathalyzer test on such and such a
date.
MR. HAGOPIAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

But I thought also the hearing that you

would require would be more than what the custom her© would
afford.

You would want to be able to call any kind of a

witness you wanted?
MR. HAGOPIAN:
Honor.

I don’t take that position, Your

I just think — I don’t even take the position you

have to have a hearing before the registry instead of an
opportunity to respond.
In some way, Your Honor —
QUESTION:

Let me ask you:

suppose you had all

the hearings you wanted before the suspension.

Just suppose

57
w 57

that.
MR. HAGOPIAN;
QUESTION;

Yes.

And the registrar says, now we’ve had all

the hearings you want.

And you say, yes, all the hearings.

He says, I now find there is probable cause to suspend your
license.
MR. HAGOPIAN;
QUESTION;'

Yes.

And if you want a full hearing some

other time, we’ll give it to you.
MR. HAGOPIAN;
QUESTION:

That would satisfy you?

MR. HAGOPIAN;
QUESTION;

Right.

It certainly would.

So you don’t take —- you don’t think

then just a — just a police report furnishes probable cause
to susperid the license even for a day?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

I think

that’s really the heart of the issue of the due process clause,
is, that there must be some interaction with the citizen
himself.

You’ve got the dignity interest and the representative

interest —
QUESTION:

Well, when you say —

MR. HAGOPIAN:

-- by the duo process clause.

And

that5s totally absent.
QUESTION;

When you say, the opportunity to respond,

you say you don't want an evidentiary hearing, but you want a

58
58

quote, opportunity to respond, close quote.
What would the opportunity to respond consist of?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

Well, I don't think that— this

Court’s ever resolved that.
QUESTION:

What would the issue be?

QUESTION:

Well, you're the one — you're the one

that —
MR. HAGOPIAN:

Well, I certainly think he has the

opportunity — he should have the opportunity to file an
affidavit to respond to the charges in writing,

That's an

absolute minimum.
QUESTION:

I.a., and what would the issue be?

That

he did not refuse?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

Right, exactly.

And if he filed an

affidavit — exactly.
QUESTION s

Just a minutec

Would that be the only

issue?
MR. HAGOPIAN:

No.

Because there are three other

issues under the statute before the registry cam revoke.
He must show that there was probable cause for the initial
arrest.

He must show that there was a valid arrest.

And

that involves whether he was.on a public way and a multitude
of other factors.
QUESTION:

I know.

MR. HAGOPIAN %

Yea.

There would be three issues.
Three issues that Massachusetts

59

sets out as the basis for the revocation*
QUESTION:

And those would bethe only issues»

MR».HAGOPXANs
QUESTION:

That• s correct.

And what if the registrar after hearing

that he had contested all three of those by an affidavit saying
the police were wrong

all three said, fine, you’ve had

your opportunity to respond, your license is suspended»
No problem?
MR. HAGOPXAN s

MR. HAGOPXAN:

Yes.

That’s the most the state would have to

find, isprobabie cause?
MR. HAGOPXAN:

They’ve got to find — that there’s

at least prima faci® evidence that the government has mat
the burden of proving ~
QUESTION:

Well, that’s a little more than probable

MR. HAGOPXAN:
QUESTION:

Well, X suppose it is, Your Honor.

Well, of course it is.

Most probable

QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. HAGOPIAN:

In criminal proceedings, Your Honor,

that may be ferae; in a criminal proceeding.

That issue of the

search warrant as distinguished in Puentes v. Sheyin, and
that8s a criminal proceeding.

And I also believe it was

distinguished more recently in a case last terra in which I
think you took the majority opinion on.
QUESTION:

Arid' ~ or

Wall, I'm just suggesting to you that

there ar© an awful lot of important, probable cause determinations
that involve loss of liberty that are made ex parte, and made
only by one person in writing.
MR. HAGOPIAN:

In a criminal sense, yes.

civil sense, I know ©f no
QUESTION:

In a

—

Wall, are you saying --

MR. HAGOPIAN:

~ case that this Court has ever held

where an ex parte, there could be a deprivation ©f a property

QUESTION:

You can deprive a person of liberty but —

QUESTION:

But not property?

QUESTION:

-- not property, ex parte?

That's a

great — that9s a fine argument for that.
MR. HAGOPIAN:
in a civil sense, no.

Not in a — in a criminal sans©, yes;
I know ©£ no case that this Court has

held, other than that there9s an emergency doctrine where
there could be an ex parte; and that's the issue: an ex parte

61
61

deprivation of property

or liberty in a civil sense.

Leaving the criminal side of the law aside, in a
civil sense 1 know of no case this Court has ever held,
absent an emergency condition, that there could be an
part© deprivation, even on an affidavit.

I know of no

case that this Court has ever held to that.
QUESTION;

Well, hunting around a little, I'm sure

I could find one.
MR. HAGOPXAW:

Well, I know that there are a number

of old cases -- I would just like to say one last thing, Your
Honor.

The state has absolutely no interest in immediately

taking these drunks off the road, Your Honor.
Under the procedure in Massachusetts now, everybody
who1 s drunk, 95 percent ©f them, they all. go into the
rehabilitative program after they are convicted.

They're

still ©nrthe road.
Why is it ~ what justification is there for the
state to take away that man's right to seme hearing before
the state — the registry takes any action?

If, in fact,

after ~ even if they're drunk, and they're all convicted,
they're all on tha road anyway, Your Honor.

There is n©

legitimate state ~

law.

MR» HAGOPIAN:

That3a correct, Your Honor»

But

that5s not the issue.
The issue is, is there any immediate reason to
impose that

90-day sanction.

QUESTION:

No, Massachusetts by enacting this

legislation said, yes, there is? or else they wouldn't have
enacted the legislation.
MR. HAGOPIAN:

that they've enacted it because they feel that instant

the breathalyser.
MR. HAGOPIANs

And I think that’s foreign to our

system of justice, and it always has been.
why don’t we do away with trials?
