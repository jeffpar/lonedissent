MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in 648, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against
Pennzoil.
Mr, Barnett,

you may proceed whenever you9re ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BARNETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The principal question in this case is whether the
Federal Power Commission, now the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, validly interpreted the Natural Gas Act when it
held that it would be inconsistent with the Act for the
Commission to approve as a just and reasonable rate above
the otherwise applicable ceiling rate, and for the Commission
thus to pass through to interstate pipelines and hence to the
consuming public incremental royalty costs based on the price
of natural gas in the unregulated intrastate market.
Respondents Shell and Pen <5 oi 11 produce gas from a
field in Southern Louisiana and sell it in interstate commerce
under certificates granted by the Commission to United Gas
Pipe Line Company, an interstate pipeline.
The gas is produced by Shell and Pennsoil under
leases granted by the landowner/'lass or Williams in 1934 and
1952.

The 1934 lease provides for royalty to Williams of

4
one-eighth of the value of the gas produced? the 1952 lease
provides for royalty of one-fourth of the value of the gas
produced»

In each case the value was to be calculated at the

market price or the market rate prevailing at the well»
Shell and Pennzoil had always computed and paid their royalties
as fractions of the market rate that they actually received by
selling the gas to United,

Rates which, since this Court's

1954 decision in the Phillips case, have been set by the
Commission„
Thus, in 1975, the applicable Commission rates to
the gas in this case were approximately 31 cents and approximafcaly 60 cents.
Beginning in 1973, however, Williams demanded payment
from Shell and Pennzoil of royalties based on the market
value of the natural gas in the unregulated intrastate market,
These values were Said'by Williams to range from 35 cents to
70 cents per Mcf for the period through mid-1974, and then
from 1974 to 1975, from $I»30 to $1,40 per Mcf,
When Shell and Pennzoil

refused to pay these

higher royalties, Williams purported to terminate the leases«
Shell and Pennzoil then sued Williams over this question in
Louisiana State court»

Before the court made a ruling, the

parties entered into a settlement agreement contingent on
approval by the Commission»
The settlement provides that Shell and Pennzoil woulti

5
apply to the Commission for permission to pay specified
increased royalties to Williams and to pass through these
increases to United,

The royalties provided for in the

settlement were royalties based on — that is, the appropriate
fraction of — either a price of 78 cents per Mcf, increasing
1,5 cents a year after 3975, or based on a price of 150 percent
of the highest rate set by the Commission, whichever was
higher; that is, whichever, the

78 cents or the 150 percent

of the Commission rate, was higher.
As an alternative, the settlement provided that
Shell and Pennzoil would ask the Commission for permission to
abandon the portion of the gas that was attributable to the
royalty interest, that is one-eighth or one™fourth, so that
that gas could be paid to Williams as a royalty-in-kind for
sale by Williams wherever Williams wanted to sell it,
presumably in the intrastate market.
Shell and Pennzoil then duly took this agreement to
the Commission, seeking its approval.

The Commission’s

Administrative Law Judge denied the petition for the special
relief for the higher rate that would pass through these
incremental royalties to the pipeline.

The judge concluded

that special relief from an area or a national irate is
warranted only when a producer can demonstrate that his over­
all costs from the operation in question are higher than the
Commission’s ceiling or that his out-of-pocket expenses will

6

exceed revenues 0
The judge found that Pennzoil had made no attempt to
make any such cost showing# and that while Shell had made such
an attempt# Shell had failed» The judge found in particular
that if Shell were to pay royalties based on the 78-cent rate
in the settlement# Shell would still make a profit of something
like $290 #000 a year on the leases in question under thcs
Commission’s ceiling? that is# it would not need a higher rate
to make that profit»
The judge further found that even if Shell —

As compared with what?

Well# if the standard is that in

order to obtain special relief from a Commission rate you
have to show that your cost would exceed your revenues *—
QUESTION s
MR» BARNETT:

You have to show a hardship case,

certainly isn’t inequal to show that you are making a profit

QUESTION;
profit that was.

Well# you didn't define what kind of a

Are you talking about a net clear profit

after all costs# and that sort of thing?
MR» BARNETT:

Well# after all costs that Shell showed

7
hera,

Shell was given en opportunity to show whatever costs

it could, and, after all costs it showed, the Administrative
Law Judge found that it would still have a profit,
QUESTION?

Does the record show what their profit

would have been if the decision of the Commission was correct?
MR, BARNETTs

No, it does not, Yoxir Honor,

Except one can figure it out by adding the incremental
royalties to the -- to what the Administrative Law Judge
found that their profit would be without

it.

In addition to denying the price relief, the
Administrative Law Judge also denied the alternative abandon­
ment relief.
The Commission affirmed the denial of the requested
rate increase, but on a broader ground than the Administrative
Lav; Judge had taken.

The Commission found that the impetus

for the settlement is the market value of the royalties f and
held that it would be inconsistent with the Natural Gas Act
for it to allow the pass-through as just and reasonable rates
under the Act of such incremental royalty costs that were
based on the market value of natural gas in the unregulated
intrastate market,
QUESTIONs

Mr, Barnett, did it actually take the

position that it had no jurisdiction to consider them?
MR, BARNETT:
jurisdiction.

The Commission never said it had no

The Commission did put its holding in terms of

8

lacking authority,» that it ~
QUESTION?

Which is pretty much the

MR» BARNETT;

I don9t think it is»

Commission did consider the question»

same thing»
Because the

The Commission had a

full hearing and considered whether it should grant the
relief requested, and decided that it should not because to
grant it would be inconsistent with the Act»
Now, the Commission phrased that holding in terms
of lacking authority under the Act, but tbs Commission made
the decision, that it lacked the authority»

The holding would

be no different if the Commission had simply said:

We hold

that to grant relief based on incremental royalties based on
intrastate markets would ha inconsistent with the Act as
interpreted by this Court in Texaco»
So while the decision is phrased largely in terms
of lacking authority, it’s also phrased in terms of being
inconsistent with the Act, the Commission decided that it
lacked authority, it was a decision made by the Commission?
and thus we submit that the question before the Court here
is whether this was a valid interpretation of the Act by
the Commission»
QUESTION:

It decided that it simply could not

consider this factor.
MR» BARNETT:
QUESTION:

It considered this case, and it --

It considered the case, but it could not

9

consider this particular factor,
MR, BARNETTi

Which particular factor?

1 mean, it

decided that it could not grant relief for incremental
royalties based on the intrastate market.

What it decided

that it could not consider was whether these particular royalties
were reasonably incurred.

And the reason it decided that it

could not consider that was because it had decided, as a
matter of law, that when the royalties are based on the intra~
state market, to allow them would be inconsistent with the
Act,
The only thing it refused to consider was the
particularized question of whether these royalties were
reasonably incurred.
The Commission also -QUESTION: So you are saying, then, that the
Commission decided that it would, violate the Act for them to
grant relief in this case?
MR, BARNETTt

Yes,

The Commission decided that it

would violate -the Act as interpreted by this Court in the
Texaco case for it to grant relief in tills case or in any
similar case where special relief is sought based on
incremental royalties, based on the unregulated market price,
QUESTIONS

Is that the position the Commission took

in the Court of Appeals?
MR, BARNETTs

I am not familiar with the Commission’s

10

brief in the Court of Appeals, Your Honor, so I cannot answer
that question»

1 think it is the position the Commission

took in its order, in its orders on rehearing»
QUESTIONS

Do you think the Commission adequately

states the reasons for its decision in its opinion?
MR, BARNETT:
QUESTION s

I think it does»

I think there are —

Under your ordinary administrative

practices of explaining clearly enough what the grounds for
the decision are?
MR. BARNETT:

I think it does»

As in the previous

case, if I were writing, if I were writing the Commissions
opinion, just as if I were writing the Act of Congress, I
like to think I could do a better job»

But I think hare the

Commission's decision is entirely adequately reasoned by the
applicable standards.

The Commission made clear, relying on

this Court's holding in the Texaco case, that it would be
inconsistent with the Act for it to

establish as a just and

reasonable rate royalties — a rate that is based on cost
based on the intrastate price, the unregulated intrastate
price.
QUESTION:

So that if someone comes in and just

says, "I am now having to pay more for ray gas than I used to,
and I want a rata adjustment'1, the Commission says, "We have
no power under the Act to grant that"?
MR® BARNETT:

Oh, no, no, not at all. The Commission

11
says, "We have no power under the Act to grant it51 or "We
decide under the Act that we will not grant it"? if the
higher costs you are talking about are higher costs that are
simply based on the unregulated price of gas®

Which the

Commission found that the costs here were»
QUESTION:

That is simply a factor which the

Commission will not take into consideration in deciding whether
a higher rate should be granted?
MR® BARNETT:

No, no, the Commission took it into

consideration here and decided that tinder the Act that it may
not grant the higher

QUESTION:

That ^ all I asked you®

MR® BARNETT:

Yes®

Well, yes, but the point is that, as

the respondents present the case, it’s simply a procedural
matter and the Commission here has refused even to consider

QUESTIONS

We have had two or three cases here in

the short tine I’ve been on the Court coning from the
predecessor of the FERCj where the Commission has started out
taking a position, we simply have no jurisdiction to consider
this? arid by the time it gets here it turns out they have
jurisdiction but they could easily have decided it the way
they did on an administrative basis,,
MR» BARNETTs

Well, that’s trueB

But in this case,

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc, the Commission never said it lacked
jurisdiction? it did use the word "'authority58»

But ws

assert that the same —
QUESTIONS

That's just a legal decision»

MR® BARNETTs Yes, it's simply a legal decision»
There is no different effect between its saying it lacks
authority under the Act and its saying, "As we interpret the
Act, it would be inconsistent with the Act for us to do this®"
QUESTIONS

Has the Commission always taken this

position or not?
MR» BARNETT s
QUESTIONS

No.

MRo BARNETTs

Always in this case?
In other cases, similar casas»
Well, this was the first case

presented to us that presented this issue, Hr» Justice
Rehnquisfc,
QUESTION?

You mean about an independent producer?

MR» BARNETTs About a royalty based on a market value

13

of royalty which was interpreted to refer to the unregulated
intrastate market,
QUESTIONS What about the cases that Pennsoil referred
to, the pipeline cases?
MR, BARNETTS

Oh, X9m sorry.

You5re referring to

El Paso and Cumberland? I thought you were referring to
earlier cases,
1-

QUESTIONs

Well, I was.

But now I9m asking you

about —•
MR, BARNETT:

Yes, Well, they are distinguishable.

The El Paso case involves a pipeline as distinguished from an
independent producer,
QUESTIONS

But the same section of the law,

MR, BARNETTs Well, it*s the same section, except
that the section that provides

Section 2,66 of the

Commission’s regulations does provide, as Pennsoil states,
that pipelines as well as independent producers are subject
to the applicable ceiling price.

However, in fact, El Paso

was granted an exception from that provision in the very
El Paso case.

And under that exception, El Paso’s rates were

established on a strict cost~of~service basis? that is,
established individually for El Paso, so it was not a
question of special relief from an otherwise applicable rate.
Now, in the Columbia case, which is also cited,
that was a case involving — where a pipeline made some

14
purchases of gas which were held to be non — which were
previously held to be non*»jurisdictional purposes ~ purchases,,
That is? the sale of the gas to the pipeline was not regulated
by the Commission ? and the question was whether the price that
tha pipeline paid in that unregulated purchase could be
included in the pipeline's rate? and the Commission held that
it coulds
Well?apart from the fact that it ~
QUESTION?

Yes? but that was an individual case®

There had already been a, ceiling price established in
Columbia?

hadn't there?
MR. BARNETTs
QUESTION?

I think so?

Your Honor®

Well? what's the difference between that

case and this one?
MR. BARNETT3

Well? I think tile difference between

that case and this case is that that is a special case
involving jurisdictional purchases of gas to — how else are
you going to treat that —
QUESTION t

Non-jurisdictional purchases®

MR. BARNETTs
QUESTIONS

I'm sorry? non-jurisdictional purchases®
Well? this is non-jurisdictional here?

too.
MR. BARNETTs
jurisdictional? too.
QUESTIONS

That's right; the royalties are nonWe think there — *
Well? what is the difference?

15
MR, BARNETTs

Well, we think the Commission was

justified in thinking that there's a difference because if you
allow the pass-through of non-jurisdictional

market value

royalty rates, market value royalties being so common, you are
going to completely undermine the regulated rates for the sales
that the producers snakej whereas, to do it in an individual
case like Columbia, those non-jurisdictional purchases would
not underlie a whole -QUESTIONs

But you’re still construing the same

section of the statute,,
MR, BARNETT*

»
You are still construing the same

statute, but the Commission could .make the decision that if
it granted the relief in the market value royalty cases, it
would be undermining the entire regulatory scheme, as this
Court pointed out in Texaco, which was another case where a
whole regulatory scheme would be undermined, and there is no
such affect in an individual case of non-jurisdictional
purchases such as Columbia»
QUESTION*

So I take it the Commission didn't agree

with the Administrative Law Judge?
MR, BARNETT*

The Commission did not address itself

to the Administrative Law Judge’s holding that this case
turns because —
QUESTION*

Because the Administrative Law Judge

thought, the Commission had legal power under the statute,

16
that the Commission sale! it didn*t have?
MR. BARNETT%

The Administrative Law Judge didn't

really address the question the Commissioner addressed, either.,
He simply said the threshold for such relief is?
that you're operating at a loss?

Can you show

And this has not bean shown,,

The Commission didn't lcok at that question, it said that -QUESTION? They just said, "We can't gat there",
that's it.
MR. BARNETT?
QUHSTIOH?

It said, !!We can't get ~
"It’s illegal for us to get to that

question".
MR. BARNETT?

It said that under the Act it would

ba illegal for us to grant relief in this case»

The

Commission did not, however, and as we point out in our
reply brief, the Commission's holding is not applicable to a
case where that kind of a shewing was made.
If the producers did show that, their costs exceeded
their revenues, so that they had made a case for confiscation,
the Commission has not addressed that issue. The Commission’s
decision
QUESTION'S

Then suddenly it would be legal to

recognise the extra royalty cost gap?
MR. BARNETT?'

Well, yes, it might be. The

Commission here does not interpret the Act to require it to
do something unconstitutional, which it would be to impose a

17

confiscatory rate*

Anci thus* again* the Commission decision

is an interpretation of the Act as applied to

market value

royalties based on the unregulated market in a situation that
does not present a case in confiscation»
Mow* the reason the Commission interpreted the Act
this way was largely this Court9s decision in Texaco* where
the Court made quite clear* as it said* that the prevailing
price in the marketplace cannot be the final <measure of
just and reasonable rates mandated by the Act* and it further
pointed out there that while the Commission had said that the
rates would be subject to refund

if they were unreasonable*

reasonableness was apparently to be judged by the standard
of the marketplace®
Mow, there are one or two factual differences
between this case and Texaco * which I assume my colleagues
will point out* and which I would therefore like to address»
It is that there are two what I would call
quail' ti&ative differences only.

It is true that in Texaco

it was the entire rates of the small producers whose reason­
ableness was to be judged by the standardcf the marketplace»
Whereas here the royalties are only a fraction of the market
v.

price* one»fourth or one-eighth here* as

against the entire

market price in Texaco®
Another quantitative difference is that here again
you would •— that in Texaco*

again you were talking about the

IS
entire price charged by the small producers, whereas here the
royalty increment is only a portion of the price that the
producers would be charging the pipelines»
We submit that neither of these quantitative
differences changes the applicable principle»
The second difference can be readily dismissed as a
matter of law* because the incremental royalty here, even
though it°s only an increment, even though it would only be
a part of the price the producers charge the pipeline, was
the entire rate that the producers are asking the Commission
to approve as just and reasonable»

It was the entire

incremental royalty that had to be shown to be just and
reasonable, and thus the Commission’s refusal to find it
just and reasonable, and the Commission exactly said as much,
that it had to find tie entire incremental royalty to be just
and reasonable, is completely consistant with Texaco»
Now, the other difference, one»£ourth and one»
eighth versus the whole thing, is again clearly riot a
difference in principia» The Gout said as much in Texaco,
417 U«S», at 399, where it said, '’Even if the effect of
increased small producer prices would make a small dent in
the consumer's pocket, when compared with the rate charged
by large producers, the Act makes unlawful all rates which
are not just and reasonable and does
unlwafulness is permitted»

not say a little

19

Thus it's true of the incremental rate that the
producers want it passed through here, just as it was true
of the rate in Texaco, that it would be judged exclusively by
the market prices? and thus we submit the Commission was
entirely justified in relying on Texaco for its conclusion
that it would be inconsistent with the Act to allow the
pass-through as a just and reasonable

rate of royalties

based on the unregulated market»
Another reason for the Commission's decision is
pointed out by the effect of the Court of Appeals decision
below, the

decision that we ask toe* Court to reverse»

Respondents attempt to address that decision in sheep's
clothing, and argue that it is simply a procedural issue
that’s at stake here, seising on the Commission’s language
about authority, and thus, for example, Shell says in its
brief, "The Court of Appeals did not require the Commission
to find for the producer; the Commission was merely required
to consider the merits of the producer’s position»’5
Well, that £?ounds fine»
The short answer, first, is that the Commission hert
did consider the merits

of the producer’s position»

It did

consider thwether it should grant the producers tie relief
they seek, and it decided not to»

It decided that it would

not do so, it could not do so, because to do so would be
inconsistent with the Act as interpreted by this Court in

20

Texaco c.
But, further, the fact is that the Court of Appeals
decision clearly would require the Commission to grant
relief and not simply to consider doing so*
For example, the Court of Appeals said — this is
on page 7A in the Appendix to the Petition — '’This is not to
say that every additional cost must be passed through to the
customer to protect a producer’s level of profits»

The

Commission has authority to consider the reasonableness of
any costs incurred,*'
But the kicker is, under the ad hoc reasonableness
standard, the Commission would be required to find the cost
to be reasonable in any case of a market value royalty that
was held to apply to the intrastate market.

Shell and

Pennzoil, whan they depart momentarily from their minimalist
portrait of the decision below, admit as much. They argue
that the Commission would be required to grant them relief
for several reasonss

that these leases were entered into

before the Natural Gas Act, or before Phillips, that the
royalty provisions were consistent with the industry standards
at the time, and that the price increase would generate no
process, since it would simply be passed through.
Well, that would be true generically, typically, of
market value leases in any State where such leases have been
held or might be held tc refer to the intrastate market.

21

Thus , if all the Commission could consider was
whether a particular royalty had been entered into reasonablyt
it would have to find that it was,

And thus, what’s at stake

here is not simply a procedural issue but whether the Commis­
sion muast grant relief on a generic basis for such market
value royalties, and tha Commission held, consistently with
Texaco, that it may not do so,

; -

Isd like to reserva the balance of my time,
QUESTION;

Mr, Barnett, before you sit down

MR, BARNETTs Sure,
QUESTIONS

Your reply brief filed yesterday reached

my desk just this morning,,
MR, BARNETT?

I'm sorry, Mr, Justice Blackmun, we

filed it in typescript with tha permission of the Clerk last
Wednesday,

We did have a printing problem,
QUESTION?

I am not being critical, I merely

would like to have you

make a one or two-sentence « comment

on the effect of the 573 Act,

Because it seems to me that

the new Act makes the underlying rationale of Texaco almost
■wMiiiinwimn

ti

inapplicable from here on in,
MR, BARNETT?
QUESTION:

Well,, we don't think it does —
You tried to downplay it in your brief,

but maybe I should ask this question of opposing counsel?
but at least I'd like some comment from you,
MR, BARNETT? Well, we don’t try to downplay it, we

22

*— that is, the Commission"s view of the impact of the Act,
the Act has a considerable impact in many ways.

However, as

we point out in the brief, the ceiling price provided by the
new Act for gas that was already dedicated to interstate
commerce under the old Act would remain the ceiling price that
had been set by the Commission, as adjusted for inflation,
or that had been increased by the Commission under the just
and reasonable rates of the new Act»
Thus, the prices applicable to this gas under the
new Act are based on the prices applicable under the old Act,
and that, very briefly, is why we think the issue is still
alive and needs decision? although, admittedly, in the future,
as the two markets converge, the practical significance of the
issue may be expected to decrease»
Thank you»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Stevens.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERON STEVENS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT PENNZOIL
MR. STEVENS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I must say that I’ve been increasingly intrigued
as this case has developed on its way from the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals, particularly in the position that the
Commission has been taking.

I didn’t prepare these remarks

to begin this way, but let me take a few minutes of my time

23

and tell you why I'm so intrigued.
That is, the Commission in its opinion, in the
opinion in the case below, said, and I quote?

"We cannot

permit any incremental royalty cost resulting from this
settlement or resulting from any judgment by a State court
regarding royalty payments to be passed on to the pipeline,
if these incremental royalty costs are based on any other
factors than the. regulated just and reasonable rate»"
They did not say, Bwe cannot permit any rate based
on intrastate rates to be passed on"; they said, "any
factor other than the just and reasonable rate."

And of

course there are a number of other factors that should be
involved in any case like this, and they are involved in the
case below, that we had witnesses about it and all that.
The interesting thing about this is the Commission
decided it had no authority.

This case was tried in the

Fifth Circuit as a question of authority.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but that’s an ambiguous

term, too, I suppose.
MR. STEVENS:
QUESTION:

Jurisdiction, if you will, Your Honor.
Well, there’s no word about jurisdic­

tion in its opinion.
MR. STEVENS;

I agree, and that's why we’ve used

the word "authority’8,
QUESTION:

And there isn’t in the -- and the Court

24
of Appeals didn't refer to it as jurisdiction.
MR. STEVENS s

No, sir? I certainly agree with that.

QUESTION: And you could sensibly call it a matter of
authority if the question was, Is it legal under the Act?
MR. STEVENS %
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.
Well, suppose to do what the Commission

was asked to do was illegal under the Act, you could say they
have no authority to grant it.
MRo STEVENS %

That's the word I would use.

I

certainly agree with that.
The interesting thing about it, though, is that,
as the record below shows, the settlement in this case — it
was a settlement of royalty litigation under market value
lease — the settlement tied the royalty to either 78 cents
or 150 percent of the national rate.

At the time the settle­

ment was executed, the Commission had before it, in a rule­
making proceeding, a proposal to permit small producers to
collect 150 percent of the national rate.
This settlement was tied exactly to that.

At that

time the national rate, as reflected in the record below, was
52 cents per Mcf? and 78 cents is exactly 150 percent of that.
This settlement was tied directly to Commission-set
rates and not to intrastate rates.
Unfortunately, the only direct testimony in this
point was produced by Pennzoil's witness Gray, and is found at

25

page 36 of the transcript in this case, which,, because of the
way the case was briefed in the Fifth Circuit, is not in the
Joint Appendix»

But of course it is available to the Court,

and, should the Court wish, we’d file that as a supplemental
appendix*
Those are the facts of how that case got to the Fifth,
Circuit*
Now, we’ve been seeing this evolving argument, and
it comes out very expressly for the first time at page 12 of
the reply brief that was filed last Wednesday, when the
Commission finally makes the assertion that the Commission
based its decision — and I’m sorry, Your Honor, I’m talking
about the typewritten copy and not the printed copy*
QUESTION? We don’t usually get the typewritten
copy.

What's the —
QUESTION; Well, what's the argument?

Maybe we can

find it*
MRe STEVENS s

That is that the Commission based

its holding on the record to the effect that this settlement
royalty was based on intrastate rates*

That is just not the

fact,
If that is now the argument that the Commission is
relying on, then I suggest that they have a serious problem
under Section 19(b) cff the Act, because that would

be a

factual finding, and,as I read Section 19(b) of the Gas Act,

26

it requires ali factual findings to be supported by substantial
evidence»

And there's not only no substantial evidence, there

is no evidence on this
QUESTION?

Wa.ll, but do you suggest that what the

government argues here in its reply brief, or elsewhere, does
not gee with what the Commission itself found in its opinion?
MR, STEVENSs

Yes, sir, I suggest exactly that»

QUESTION? So you're saying that they want affirmance
on a ground different from what
MR» STEVENS s

Yes, sir.

I’m suggesting exactly that.
QUESTIONS

Well, would you follow that by saying

that we can't reach a ground not considered by the Commission?
The Court has held that, 20-odd years ago.
MR. STEVENSs

Well, Your Honor, I'm certainly aware

that this Court has held that it would be improper to
the Burlington Trucking

case

in

to affirm a Commission

decision based on post hoc rationalization.

And, yes, sir,

I'm suggesting, if that’s the basis of their primary thrust
of their argument at this point, that the Court cannot and
should not affirm it on that basis.
Now, if the Court wishes to affirm it on the question
of authority, which is what we briefed in the Fifth Circuit,
argued there, and I thought we were arguing here, then of course
the Court is free to do that, because the Commission did address

27

that issue also»
And I would suggest that the basic reason that the
Commission has reached the position that it's in in this case
is because it did read Texaco, but it misread it»
We read Texaco as being a case basically where the
Commission was attempting to deregulate small producer rates9
by tying them directly and solely to intrastate practicee
We read Texaco as holding that the Commission cannot
deregulate something over which it has direct jurisdiction,
but that if the Commission wishes to regulate indirectly, it
mu3t consider all factors and not solely intrastate price
levels,
We're not asking the Commission in our case to de­
regulate anything.

As Mr, Barnett candidly admittedf the

Commission has no jurisdiction over royalty cost.
have jurisdiction over our entire right,

They do

And we brought forth

a request for an increase in that regulated rate, and we
asked them to consider all the relevant factors, and there
were several put out in the testimony in the case below, at
the hearing before the -~
QUESTION;

The Commission itself found that the —

I take it this is an accurate quote — the Commission found
that the impetus of the settlement is the market value of
the royalties, and no consideration has been given to
regulated rates.

So the Commission equated this request with

28
an intrastate unregulated market request»
MR» STEVENS

%

Your Honor, certainly we agree that the

impetus of the litigation and the impetus of the settlement
and the impetus of our application for relief was the litiga™
fcion that was requesting the market value be based on intra­
state or other prices»

Singly because that is what caused

this whole thing to get going doesn’t mean that that’s what
the settlement was based onc
We view their holding, as set out on page 261 of
the Joint Appendix, in the second sentence, the one I quoted
earlier, as saying they have no authority»

And that’s

certainly the way the Commission briefed it to the Fifth
Circuit, and that’s the way we briefed it»

I would suggest that since we’re not asking the
Commission to base any component of our rate on intrastate
rates solely, even assuming that our prices were based in part
on intrastate rates, we can't sea how, as a matter of logic,
the answer to the question of whether the Commission has
authority should be any different»
■Though we think what the Commissi,on has done in this
case is to do the same thine it did in Texaco, and that is to
focus solely on one comparison, and that is a comparison of
the sett3.ement rate here with intrastate prices, and then to
say, "We’re sorry, Pennzoil, we’re sympathetic to your
plight, but Texaco tells us that we can’t focus solely on this

29

comparison and grant you a rate increase»w
Pennzoil believes that our argument is consistent
-- that our reading of Texaco, pardon me, is consistent with
the purposes of the Act and with this Court’s previous decisions
and with the Commission’s previous representations to the
Court» And I’m talking specifically here about the Mobil case
in review of the Southern Louisiana Area Rate case»
In the Commission1s brief in that case, they
specifically told the Court that the producers in a market
value royalty bind could petition for individualized relief»
We believe that that was the basis upon which the Commission
was affirmed in setting area rates on that point»
QUESTION?

Do you think the Columbia case is

consistent with Texaco?

I know that one is a pipeline and

the other isn’t, but —
MR» STEVENSs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I do»

Although there the request was based on

an unregulated rate or unregulated cost»
MR» STEVENS:
QUESTION:
MR» STEVENS:

i

Yes, sir.

There

And a market price»
Yes, sir»

There, Your Honor, the

item in question that was being priced was not an item over
which the Commission had direct jurisdiction»
QUESTION: Right»
MR» STEVENS:

And they did over the small producers

30
in Texaco»
The Commission looked at the merits? as I understand
it? in the Columbia case? of the prices —
QUESTIONi

Yes? but they didn’t have any jurisdic­

tion over the prices that wears being charged in
market»

an unregulated

Just like they don't have any jurisdiction over the

royalty charges here»
MR» STEVENS:

That’s right»

Your Honor? I view the

Columbia case? the Texaco case and Fennsoil's position in this
case as being entirely consistent»

In the Columbia case?

what the Commission did basically was to look at those costs
that were being included? those purchase costs that were being
included in the pipelined flowthrough in their rates? and
say? "We don’t have jurisdiction over those? we can’t
automatically exclude them because? solely because they are
equal to or based upon or tied to or related to in some way
market value costs? but we do have the authority to review
them on the merits and determine whether or not they meet the
statutory Section 4 just and reasonable test»"
And that’s what wcs’re hare claiming the Commission
has authority to do in our case»
I think it's also consistent with the El Paso case
that you asked about earlier»

In the El Paso case the

Commission? in fact? granted the flowthrough in a jurisdictional
rate of a royalty component that's virtually identical to the

31

one that Pennsoil is asking for the flowthrough on.

Virtually

identical to it»
And they tried to distinguish that in their brief
and in this argument on the basis that that's a pipeline and
their cost of service is regulated individually.

The face

of the order in that opinion, at page 5, shows that they in
fact had to waive the national rate regulations which were
then applicable to El Paso's rates in order to grant them the
relief®
It also shows that 25 percent of El Paso's production
would continue to be priced at the applicable national rate
for producers.
But that's not really the point. The point really is
that Section 4 of the Natured Gas Act applies equally tc
producers and to pipelines. And if they have the authority to
do it for pipelines, they have the authority to do it for
producers.

And we’re not here arguing, and we didn’t argue

before the Fifth. Circuit, that the Commission is compelled to
regulate producers the same way it regulates pipelines.
If it can find reasonable reasons for distinguishing,

t

for putting in one method of regulation for pipelines and one
for producers, we have no quarrel with that, assuming they
can support that on some reasoned basis.
Our only point is that it’s the same statute, and
the authority basically has to be the same.

And I characterise

32
the question of authority as more, quite frankly, than merely
procedural»

I believe it is more than procedural.

The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, of course we have
not filed a brief on that, and I only have one brief comment
on it? and that is, that under Section 502(c) of that
statute it appears to expressly grant the Commission the
authority to permit rats relief to any individual gas producer,
notwithstanding that the end result of that rata would no
longer be just and reasonable under Section 4 of the Natural
Gas Act,
We are not arguing that as a basis for overturning
the Commission’s opinion, because it was not in effect at
that time.

But I thought it would be pertinent to at least

call it to the Court's attention,
QUESTION!

Do you think the Commission was required

to grant you, your client, the relief you asked?
MR. STEVENSs

No, sir, that is not

our claim, We

believe that on remand on the merits we will be able to show
that our request is just and reasonable, that it was pruaentiy
incurred, and that it’s in the best interest of the gas
consumers of United Gas Pipe Line and of Pennsoil.

And we

will show in fact, and did show in fact, that more gas will
be produced for the consumers? and that's why United has been
supporting this case all the way along.
Thank you very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Johnson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS Ga JOHNSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SHELL OIL CO.
MR. JOHNSONs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court %
My name is Thomas Ga Johnson, representing Shell Oil
Company.
I would like to address first the question of the
basis of the Commission’s decision, which I believe is clear
from the face of the opinion.
If the Court will refer to page 261 of the Appendis,
the Commission said at that point, "We cannot permit any
incremental royalty costs resulting from this settlement, or
resulting from any judgment by a State court regarding
royalty payments,to be passed on to the pipeline if these
incremental royalty costs are based on any other factors than
the regulated just and reasonable rate."
I believe the Commission is saying, and reading
Texaco, is that they do not have the authority to grant the
relief requested by Shell and Pennzoll in this case.
QUESTION:

But the sentence starts out, "As such",

and I suppose that refers to the previous sentence?
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the previous sentence, to make the record completa,
says, "th© impetus of the settlement is the market value of

34
the royalties? and no consideration has been given to regulated
rates.58

And that’s the way the Commission reads Texaco.
If confirmation is needed,' I believe it appears in

the Court of Appeals opinion at page 6a of the Appendix to
the Petition for Certiorari.

And the Court of Appeals said,

”th@ Commission concluded that it was ’not free to allow
royalty costs, which are based on market values, to be passed
on to the pipelines as just and reasonable rates’.*3
QUESTIONs

Well, that’s the very language that the

Commission used in this same paragraph.
MR. JOHNSONs

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

And I believe what this says is that the Commissioii
did not reach the issue of whether the increased royalty costs
would result in a ceiling rate being imposed on Shell and
Pennzoil which is confiscatory.
It is our position that it is.
Law Judge disagreed with our position.

The Administrative
The Commission did not

reach it.
With reference to another issue which the Commission
did not decide because of its position, is whether the
increased royalty cost was prudently and reasonably incurred.
This was specifically reserved by the Court of Appeals to the
Commission on remand.
If the Commission’s position is confirmed here, the
Commission will never reach these issues because it contends

35

that it has no authority to decide them»
1 would now like to discuss the reference to Justice
Blackmun’s question about the Natural Gas Policy Act, and
whether Congress has undermined the import of Texacoa
We believe that while the Natural Gas Policy Act
fixes different categories, price categories for gas, it
still makes a difference as to whether the gas was sold on the
intra or interstate market»

That as far as the rationale of

Texaco is concerned, it is no longer material, because the
ceiling prices set out prospectively in the Natural Gas Policy
Act apply across the board, whether the sale is interstate or
intrastate»
In fact, as a portion of that Act, Section 105,
the Congress specifically approved intrastate contract prices
for past periods as being the maximum lawful price permitted
under the Act»
We therefore believe that the Commission and this
Court’s earlier concern about the unregulated market is no
longer material under this Act»
As Mr# Stevens pointed out, this Commission has
itself utilized intrastate prices along with other factors
in determining producer rates in past cases»

In the Area Rate

proceedings, specifically the Other Southwest Area Rate case,
the Commission did utilise intrastate prices in determining
the producer rates»

This use was attacked on appeal in the

36
Fifth Circuit and was specifically affirmed by the Fifth
Circuit® This Court denied certiorari®
In the first National Rate proceeding on New Gas,
Shell Oil Company v® FPC, at 520 Fed 2d, the issue was again
raised in the Natiana1 Rate case®

The Commission relied on

intrastate prices as one of the factors that it looked at in
determining producer rates®

It was again affirmed by the

Circuit Court? this Court again denied certiorari®
Mr® Stevens has already referred to the pipeline
case, which we believe are squarely in point here®
The Commission also, in dealing with the prices on
emergency sales for natural gas and limited-terra sales by
producers, has referenced to comparable prices in the intrastate market in determining whether these sales are reasonable
or unreasonable.
The Commission collects data on the intrastate
market on Form 45, and quarterly publishes reports of that
data, which it utilizes in producer rates®
We therefore do not believe the Commission acts
consistently when it says that it cannot look to intrastate
prices for any purpose®
We would also like to point out that we believe that
this case is distinguishable from Texaco because the royalty
provides only one of the cost components, which the Commission
looks to in determining producer rates.

37
The price of the other cost components, steel pipe,
labor#, federal income taxes#, is not subject to Commission
regulation either»

But, as the Court of Appeals pointed out,

these prices are used as determinants in the Commission rate0
I would like to refer to a quotation which appears
in the Stats of Louisiana brief from the Mlssis sippi River
Fuel case, decided by the De Cc, Circuit, because it's very
pertinent here?
"Expenses »„ „ are facts»

They are to be ascertained,

not created, by the regulatory authorities»

If properly

incurred, they must be allowed, as part of the composition of
the rates*

Otherwise, the so-called allowance of a return on

investment as being an amount over and above expenses, would
be a farce»”
QUESTIONS

Let me ask you, sirs

Suppose the

Commission hadn't talked about authority or what this statute
required or authorized, but just said, "We've been setting
are® rates, and our rule is, and we think it's consistent
with the statute, our rule is we'll never change an area
rate just based on some single cost factor? or at least we
will grant no exceptions' from an area rate that we've set
for an individual producer unless he shows that there's some
confiscatory element in the picture.

We might have authority

to have a different rule, but this is our rule, we're just
not going to grant any individual exceptions to an area rate*

38

If royalties go up or something like that, maybe we'll set
a new area rate sometime, but until somebody is being put out
of business, we're not granting any exception»"

Would that

be inconsistent with the Act?
MR« JOHNSONt

Mr, Justice White, I‘d like to answer

that question in three ways»
First of all, your question excepted the question of
confiscatory rates»
QUESTION :

Yes»

MR» JOHNSON %

And we believe that is one of the

issues in this case which the Commission refused to consider»
QUESTION:

Yes»

MR» JOHNSON:

Secondly, in the Permian case, part

of the reason why this Court affirmed the area rate was the
exception which the Commission said it would grant in special
cases, like this case»
And, thirdly, in the Mobi1 case, the Commission
expressly was faced with the situation here and asked by the
producers in the Texas Gulf Coast Area Rate proceeding and
the Southern Louisiana Area Rate proceeding, which became the
Mobil case in this Court, to allow relief for this very problem,
the market value royalty question on an area or a national
basis.

The Commission refused to do so»

And in saying it

refused to do so on a national or an area rate basis, it
said that it took the position that producers could bring

29

special relief cases like this case in order to get this
question resolved»
The Fifth Circuit specifically

affirmed the

Commission on that basis* and the Fifth Circuit's language,
if I could just quote it, is thiss

"If, as subsequent events

develop, the producers are put in a bind by their royalty
obligations, they may certainly petition the FPC for
individualized relief»IJ
That language from the Fifth Circuit was quoted in
this Court's opinion in Mobil, with approval»
Now the producers are here before this Court,
asking for the specific kind of individualized relief which
this Court indicated in Mobil it would grant»
QUESTION:

My question wass

Would it be contrary

to the Act for the Commission to have the rule that I posited?
And you've said up to now it doesn't seem to have had that
rule? that's all you've said so far»
But, is it your

position that, it would ba contrary

to the Act if the Commission said, "We're just not going to
grant any exceptions unless there's some claim of confiscatory
rates *?
MR. JOHNSON 5

Your Honox-, again I would refer to the

Permian case, find, as I read Permian, that was one, of the
bases that this Court utilized in affirming *—
QUESTIONs

So your answer is that it would be

40

contrary to the Act?
MR* JOHNSON?

I think it would be contrary to the

Act if the Commission,» in so doing, imposed a confiscatory
ratee

The purpose of the exception, the specific exception

for an individual case, is to allow the Commission to consider
this quasfcion0 And 1 believe other cases in this Court have
indicated that the Commission cannot impose a confiscatory
rate.

Even in an area rate case,
QUESTION?

Well, would you be satisfied in this case

if the Commission said, MWe’ll grant you relief when and if
you show that it's confiscatory"?
MR„ JOHNSON? Your Honor, what we"re asking for in
this case «•QUESTION?

That isn’t all you’re asking, is it?

That isn’t all you’re asking?
MR* JOHNSON?
QUESTION?

Well, —

You’re asking them to ~ in any event,

that they must, or at least they’ve got the authority to re­
determine the just and reasonableness of a rate, based on new
royalty costs, in any case, whether it’s confiscatory or not»
Isn’t that true:?
MR0 JOHNSON?

Your Honor, I think — if I could re­

state our position — I -think what we’re asking is this?
Since the Commission expressly refused to consider this
problem in the area and national cases, and told this Court

41
that this was the kind of case they would consider, that we
believe we’re entitled to that kind of consideratione
Nawr the Commission can hold against us on the
merits, and if this Court affirms the Court of Appeals, the
case will go back before the Commission on remand and it
will consider the merits of the confiscation question.
On the other hand, if the Commission is affirmed,
the question will never be considered, because the Commission
will have been found without authority to consider it,
QUESTION?

Well, you would be satisfied, then, if

the only thing that were left open on remand is whether or
not the result would be confiscation if your request is not »*»
MR, JOHNSONs

Your Honor, I think the answer is

I would not be satisfied,
QUESTIONs

You want a little more than that, I

would think,
MR, JOHNSONi

Yes, Your Honor,

I think what we want

is a fair trial on the merits, and that’s what we’re asking,
QUESTION;

And the merits are more than just the

question of confiscation?
MR, JOHNSON?

Yes,

I think the merits also go to

the question of whether the royalty cost is reasonable and
prudently incurred,
QUESTION:
MR, JOHNSON s

Right,

So you —

And this is the historic test which

42

the Commission utilised in determining whether costs are
granted,
QUESTIONi

So it's not just the confiscation item

that you want?
MR* JOHNSON:

That is correct.

And as I understood

Your Honor's question when addressed to me*, that was what the
Commission would ba required to do under the law. But we
believe they should also consider whether or not these costs
are prudently incurred.
If I could turn now to another point.

The end»

result test is the test which this Court has historically
imposed on Commission decisions,

I would like to consider,

for this Court’s attention, just for a moment the end result
on the parties of the Commission's opinion.
When Shell got in this bind, as described by the
Court of Appeals, by executing its lease in 1934, before the
Natural Gas Act was even passed, the second lease in 1952 was
executed two years before this Court’s Phi Hips decision,
and the Commission was not regulating producers.
It wasn’t until 1965, in the Permian case, itfhen the
Commission decided that it would reject individual company’s
cost of service as a method of regulation of producers, and
would also reject market value studies, economic studies of
market value, end would rely instead on a composite industry»
wide cost of service — which, incidentally, included a

43

royalty coat of 12s5 percent.
It was not until the Huber and Vela cases were
decided in 1966 and 1968 that the producers suspected that the
lessors would be entitled to ascribe a higher price to their
royalty percentage and the lessee was permitted to charge
under regulation.
It was not until the Mobil case, decided by the D, C,
Circuit in 1971, that the Commission was held not to have the
authority to impose the same ceiling on the lessor.
the producers

When

found out they were in this bind, they asked

the Commission for relief in the Texas Gulf Coast and Southern
area
Louisiana/rate cases, the Commission was assured that if we
came back in an individual relief case, they would grant
relief there.
This is that case, and the Commission now contends
they do not have jurisdiction to grant this relief.
If I could turn for just a moment to the abandonment
question, here again we believe the Commission has not fully
considered the case on the merits.

The only point considered

by the Commdssion was whether, if Shell’s leases were
cancelled and -the lessor became the owner of all of the gas
in the leases, it would be required to continue to sell that
gas in interstate commerce.
Of course this Court’s Southland opinion holds that
the lessor would be so required.

But I believe the Commis-

44
sion’s duty under the public convenience and necessity test
of Section 7 goes further,,

We believe that the Commission

must consider the and result on all the parties9
From the standpoint of the lessee, the end result
of denial of abandonment is the confiscation of the lessee’s
leases.
From the standpoint of the lessor, and the standpoint
of the consumer, the consumer’s price will go up? and I will
leave that discussion to ray brief.
Thank you, Your Honor,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr, Barnett?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R, BARNETT, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, BARNETTs

Just a couple of brief points, Mr,

Chief Justice,
First of all, with respect to the Mobil case,

which

my brothers rely on, the Court said there that Mobil’s argument
is hypothetical at this stage, and that, in any event, an
effective producer is entitled to seek individualised relief.
The Court went on to quote the D, C® Circuit, which said?
”If, as subsequent events develop, the producers are put in a
bind by their royalty obligations, they may certainly petition
FPC for individualised relief,
End of this Court’s quota

Permian contemplated it,”

'45

Well, we would say* first of all, that producers
here were entitled to seek individualised relief* They did
seek it, and the Commission decided that it would be inconsistant with the Act to grant it*
Further, we would deny that the producers here have
been put in a bind in the terms of the Mqbf1 decision. The
Court went on to say, "Permian contemplated it*”

Well, what

did Permian contemplate?
If on© looks at the relevant language in the Permian
decision, 390 U*S* at 770, the Court there said, “The
Commission declared that a producer should be permitted
appropriate relief if it establishes that its out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with the operation of a particular well
exceed its revenue from the well under the applicable area
pries*

The Commission acknowledged that there might be other

circumstances in which relief would be given, but declined
to enumerate them*n
QUESTION:

In your view7, the language of Mobil, 1

think it was, of being in a bind does not occur until the
rates are confiscatory?
MR, BARNETT:

Yes, we would interpret it that way,

and we would rely on the reference to Permian, which did
precisely interpret the relief provision that way*
To respond to the point about whether the Commission
here did in fact rely on the fact that these proposed

46
incremental royalties were based on the intrastate rate, we
submit that that’s clear®

At page 261 of the Appendix, the

l

Commission said*

"In the instant proceeding, the impetus of

th© settlement is th© market value of the royalties and no
consideration has been given to regulated rates®
On rehearing, at page 290, the Commission said —
I’m sorry, 291 to 292 »«» “it is plain that the royalty is to
be based on 73 cents, which is the settlement's reflection of
markat prices, that are above the area ceiling prices»B
The Court of Appeals, Petition Appendix 3a, stated
that, "in Louisiana state court, a lessor asserted a royalty
claim based on intrastate prices for natural gas, which
greatly exceed the ceiling rates established by the FPC for
interstate sales®"
Similar statements can. be found in the Appendix,
in the initial decision at page —
QUESTIONs

Mr® Barnett, what was the connection

between 78 cents and the intrastate market price?
MR» BARNETT?

The record does not disclose what the

connection was, Mr® Justice —QUESTION s

But it was 150 percent of the regulated

rate?
MR» BARNETT?

The alternative to the 78 cents —» oh,

yes,. the —'
QUESTION s

The 78 cents was»

The other rata was

47
52 cents«,
MR® BARNSTTs

The 78 cents was in fact 150 percent

of the regulated rate for small producers®
QUESTIONS

Isn't that pretty strong evidence that

it's based on the regulated price?
MR® BARNETTS
QUESTION*

Well* --

And it had no relationship* as I under»*

stand you* to the unregulated price®
MR® BARNETTs

Well* it may well have* if the

unregulated price range was about 140 or 150* the 78 cents
may well have been thought to be about half of it®
But the short answer is —
QUESTIONt

But there’s no evidence that they did

that* and there is some testimony* not in the Appendix* that
it was based on the regulated rata®
MR® BARNETT*
QUESTION?

Well* but —

Isn’t that right?

MR® BARNETT?

Well* so my colleague says* but we

would submit that ~
QUESTION?

Do you disagree with that?

MR® BARNETT?

Well* I haven’t seen it? I certainly

wouldn’t challenge his statement®
QUESTION:

Well* is there any evidence in the record

that it was based on the intrastate market?
MR® BARNETT*

Well* there’s lots —~ yes* for example*

48
at page 55, testimony of Mr® Smith for United Gas Pipe Line
Company , who says the 73-cent price is very — N which I feel
is very reasonable in light of today's market prices.'*
Page SS, wWe are prepared to show „.® what the
latest arm’s-length intrastate prices are in this area of
South Louisiana, and it will show when I read these numbers
the very reasonable price level of 78 cents for the settlement»'*
But apart from all that -»
QUESTION*

That’s all to show that it was prudently

incurred., I suppose?

MR. BARNETT:

Yes®

But apart from all that, we

would say the computation, the mode of computation is
irrelevant.

It’s clear that the suit was for market value
