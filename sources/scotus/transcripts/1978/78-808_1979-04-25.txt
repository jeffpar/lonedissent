MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

Mrs. Shapiro, I think you may proceed when you
ar© ready now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRIET S. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. SHAPIRO;

Mr. Chi®!' Justice, and may it

pleas® th© Court;
This cae® is her® on direct appeal by the
government from a decision of the District Court for th©
Western District of Texas.

This is another case question­

ing th© constitutionality of fch© Social Security Act.
Th© particular provision involved her® is th© marriage
requirement for mother's benefits.
The wage earner, Norman W. Boles, lived with
Margaret Gongales, who is th® claimant, from 1963 to
1966, but they ware never married.
Boles, was born in 1964.

Their son, Norman J.

In 1966, th® wag© earner left

Margaret Gonzales and his child end he married Nancy
Boles in 1967.

There were two children born in this

marriage and th© wag© earner died in 1971.

All three

children ar© receiving children’s benefits on Norman W.
Boles’ account.
Mother’s benefits ar© paid .to th© widow of a

4
wage earner who ha® an entitled child in her care.

For

that reason, Nancy Boles is getting mother's benefits and
Margaret Gonsales was denied mother's benefits because she
was never married to the wage earner even though her son
is receiving benefits and is in her care.
The District Court read this Court's decision in
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld as holding that mother's benefits
are for the child, to giv© him the care of his surviving
parent.

The court found that Norman J. Boles, the child,

had himself been denied mother'3 benefits because of his
illegitimacy and that that denial was inconsistent with
the equal protection component of the due process clause
of the Fifth Amendment.

It thorcifor© declared section

202(g) of the Social Security Act, the mother's benefits
provision, unconstitutional to the extent that it limited
benefits to widows and divorced wives.

The Court enjoined

the Secretary from denying mother's bene?its to the named
plaintiffs bar to the ciasy which consists of all illegiti­
mate children and their mothers who are ineligible for
mother's benefit® solely because they 'tsar© never married

to the wage earner.
All the children in the class, like Norman Boles,
ar© getting children's benefits,

Their only claim is that

they have been injured by th® failure’to pay mother's
benefits to their mothers with whan they are living.

5

The two requirements for mother’s benefits that
are particularly important hers are# first# that they are
paid to the widow or to parsons that Congress has decided
should be treated as if they were widows.
is the marriage requirement.

That, of course,

Second, th© widow must have

in her car® a child getting benefits because of his rela­
tionship to th© wage earner.

Thefc usually, of course,

will be che widow's child, but it doesn't have to ba.

It

is th© child's rslationship to the wags earner, not to
the person that is caring for hire that counts, and th©
child’s legitimacy has nothing to do with the widow's
entifclenanfe.
These two requirements serve analytically dif­
ferent purposeso

Thus first, the marriage requirement,

defines the class, of those who are likely to have been
dependent on the wag© earner during his life, and that
class includes all the people that Congress believed
were most likely to have .lost support when the 'wage
earner died.

But loss of support is not itsalf enough.

The second, the child in car© requirement, defines th®
group within the larger class who, because of special
circumstances, ar© entitled to th© replacement of lost
support.

If you don't show membership within this par­

ticular sub-group, then Congress felt that even though
you may have lost support wh@n the wag® earner died, you

6
should make up that support through your own efforts.
Analytically, the child in care provision is very
similar to the age requirement for elderly widows.

The

theory behind mother's benefits is that a wife with an
entitled child in her care should have the same option that
she had before her husband's death, that is, either to stay
home, supported by her husband, to take care of the
children, or else to work and help to support the family.
The theory is that she shouldn't loEe this choice when the
wage earner dies, and that is why she gets the benefits.
The important point is that the class definition,
the' marriage requirement- sets the outer limits of those
Congress found likely to have lost support.
definition is a limitation on the class.

The group

It defines the

people within the class who are entitled to the replacement
of lost support.
Ms. Gonzales never mrrled the wage earner.

She

can’t meet any of the other tests that Congress has used
to identify people who are so likely to have lost support
at the wage earner’s death that they should be treated as
though they were married.
There is no indication in the record, in fact,
that these tests were Inaccurate as to Ms. Gonzales.

There

is no suggestion that she was in fact supported by the
wage earner, that she lost any support when he died. Since

7
she doesn’t belong to the class that Congress has identi­
fied as likely to have lost support, she is not entitled
to benefits.
This Court’s cases strongly support our analysis
of the statute.

The Court has frequently accepted the

Social Security Act’s use of marriage to show the likeli­
hood of support, and it has rejected claims that marriage
is too Inaccurate or imprecise an Indicator of the likeli­
hood of support to serve as a basis for denying claims.
And It has also refused to require that people who cannot
meet some particular part of the marriage requirement
should be entitled to prove that they were in fact de­
pendent, and there is no reason to reach a different result
here.
The court below believed that' Wiesenfeld required
a different result.

It said that this Court held there

that mother's benefits are for th© child so that he can
receive the care of the surviving parent.
reads Wiesenfeld.

But that mis­

The Court there was focusing on the

class definition for mother’s benefits, the definition of
the individual’s likely to have lost support when the
wage earner died.

It found that husbands as a class are

as likely to have lost support
as are wives.

when

the wage earner dies

Wiesenfeld, therefore, supports our loss

analysis of the statute because it recognizes that being

8
entitled to mother's benefits depends on membership in the
class likely to have lost support when the wage earner
died.

That is the reason that Wlesenfeld was controlling

in Goldfarb.

point of view of the childs the statute doesn’t really

The statute simply

The cases we have cited in our

reply brief show that the relationship to the wage earner
plus having in your care an entitled child, and if you
say that any illegitimate — the mother of any illegitimate
child gets benefits, that means that illegitimate children
get an advantage that legitimate children don’t and you
turn a statute — you require the statute to favor
illegitimates.
It seriously distorts Wlesenfeld to read it as
meaning that the mother’s benefit is really a child’s
benefit.
case.

The Wiesanfeld child was not a party to the

need for the replacement of lost support.
getting benefits based on those needs.

He was already

It was the surviv­

ing husband that was claiming the benefits.

It was his

loss of support and his relationship to the wage earner
that made him entitled to benefits.
Neither is it fair to read Wiesenfeld as meaning
that Social Security Act benefits are somehow designed to
recognize the emotional trauma suffered by a child who
loses a parent

and for that reason entitled him to the

10
care of his surviving parent who could not have stayed
home to care for him before the death.
Appellees here are not arguing that this Court’s
decision approving the U3G of the? marriage requirement as
wrong.

They don’t even argue that the decisions applying

the marriage requirement in the particular context of
mother’s benefits are wrong.

They are not saying that

Salfi was wrongly decided or that De Castro was.

They

argue only that the requirement cannot be used to deprive
illegitimate children of mother’s benefits because it is a
classification based on illegitimacy.

But it is not a

classification based on the child's legitimacy.

It is a

classification based on the caretaker's likelihood of lost
support that has a disparate effect on illegitimates.
That is not enough to show a denial of equal protection.
Appellees must show in addition at least that
their explanation of the statute’s purpose explains its
operation better than our’s does.

The examples given in

our reply brief show that the way the statute operates
can only be reasonably explained in terms of the replace­
ment of lost support.

It is not a grant of benefits to

mothers of legitimate children and a denial to mothers
of illegitimate children.

Our examples show that Congress

here, as it did throughout the Social Security Act, chose
to pay benefits only to the people who could, show both

XI
that they are In a class likely to have lost support and
they have a special need for the replacement of that sup­
port.

The legitimacy of the child being cared for is

totally irrelevant.
There is another example of this.

When a woman

dies leaving young children, the surviving wage earner’s
mother or other relative often mcves into the household
to care for the children and she is then supported by the
wage earner.

If the wage earner then dies, the grandmother

gets no benefits.
Gonzales has here.

She has the same problem that Ms.
She can’t show that she is a member of

any class Congress concluded was likely to have lost
support when the wage earner died.

It makes no difference

whether the children are legitimate or not in this example.
Appellees’ argument boils down to a claim that
a statutory scheme that is neutral as regards legitimacy
must be turned into one that favors the mothers of
illegitimate children.

This favoritism is demand in the

name of equal protection.
This case presents an extreme example of the
risks of seemingly minor changes in the benefits system
established by Congress.

First, it distorts the statutory

purpose of providing benefits only to

those most likely
'

<

to have been supported by the wage earner.

Second, the

extension of benefits to an additional group means that

12
the real purpose of the benefits may be lost.

Neither the

new group nor the group that Congress defined may actually
get enough support to stay home to care for children.

This

is because the statute limits the total amount payable on
any given wage earner’s account in any one month.

The

maximum will always be reached when three survivors are
being paid.

So when you have a widow and a child being

paid benefits in one household and an entitled children in
another household, you will have reached the statutory
maximum.

If you add the mother of the entitled child,

then the benefits that were previously payable will have
to be reallocated and the benefits that were going to three
people, the same benefits have to go to four people.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapirc, is that true in the

case of adding a divorced wife to the widow, when the class
is increased, does that same apply?

I got the impression

from your —
MRS. SHAPIRO:

The same principle applies.

The

only people that are outside of the family maximum are the
aged divorced wives.
QUESTION:

In this benefit scheme, if you have

a widow with a child and a divorced wife with a child,- you
divide the maximum four ways instead of the other way?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's right.

I see.

13
MRS. SHAPIRO:

And Congress concluded that in

that situation they were willing to make that division,
but —
QUESTION:

If the courts were to —

MRS. SHAPIRO:

— will undercut the purpose of

the statute because it will Increase the number of situa­
tions In which you will have spread your benefits so thinly
that they won't provide support to that nobody can stay
home.
QUESTION:

If the Court

should disagree with

you and agree with the lower cour t on ’the basic Issue of
whether the larger class should be further enlarged to
include unmarried -— persons who never married the wage
earner who had children by the wage earner, you then have
a kind of a tricky job of rewriting the statute, it-seem a
to me, because now it starts out the widow and every
surviving divorced mother.

But 1 don't understand you to

have questioned the remedy in the sense that the Court
had the power hot merely to hold the classification unconstitutional to say no benefits shall be paid pursuant
to this statute because it is discriminatory.

Rather,

what the Court held was we are going to enlarge the class
beyond the class described by Congress and pay benefits
to people Congress didn’t authorise payments for.

You

don’t question the District Court’s power to grant that

14
kind of relief, if I understand you.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Wo, we don't.

That is the kind

of relief that this Court has granted In the past in
cases in which it found that particular

what —
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That’s true.

But here I don’t know what you do.

I don’t know what word has a different meaning.

You have

got to just inject a new word into the statute.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

\

•

What the District Court said was

•

you can't apply the statutory requirements only in the
case of illegitimate children living with their mothers
who were denied benefits9 that it just by kind of main
force and awkwardness pulled out that group and said that
group gets benefits.
QUESTION:

And you don’t question the power of

the court to have don® that?

I just want to be clear about

MRS. SHAPIRO:
their power.

No, we don't.

We don't question

We certainly question the advisability of

It.
QUESTION:

I understand, and that they say they

are on the merits and the sovereign immunity point and the

15
others.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But I Just wanted to focus on that

one aspect.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That’ s c orrect.

But even if It was right on the

merits that this ia an unconstitutional legislative scheme,
couldn’t it be argued, following up my brother Stevens,
that that would be the end of the court’s function, not to
rewrite the statute to give benefits to other people but
simply to say this is what Congress_ bars' effected and is
constitutionally-invaiid?
MRS, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That is certainly —

But you do not

MRS. SHAPIRO:

It would be an option.

I think

that it would be very hard on the mothers who are now
getting benefits.

unconstitutional, it is unconstitutional.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And isn’t that the end of a court’s

function?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

It is nob the way this Court has

felt their function — that that was the end of their
function in cases like Wiesenfeld or Soldfarb in which

16
they found the statute was unconstitutional and expanded
the benefits.
QUESTION:

In any event, you don't question the

remedy in this case, as I understood your answer to my
brother Stevens’ question.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And you don't get there if you are

right on the merits?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

That's right.

If the Court has no further questions, I wish
to reserve the rest of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

Very well.

Mr. Semmel.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT SEMMEL. ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR, SEMMEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

=

I believe a simple example illustrates the
discriminatory effect on illegitimate children of the
marriage requirement for mother's benefits.

If we have

a wag© earner who lives with a woman, has a child with
that woman, lives with and supports that child every day
of the child's life until the wage earner dies, but has’
•

■

never married the mother, that family unit is deprived
of mother’s benefits and the child is deprived of the

’

i

17
opportunity for the care of the mother afforded by mother’s
benefits.
On the other hand, we have a wage earner who
marries a woman and while she is pregnant deserts her,
never sees the child, never supports the child and dies,
that family unit is entitled to mother’s benefits and
that child receives the benefit of the care of the mother
which mother's benefits makes possible.
The distinction between the two groups is simply
that in on© case th© mother and the father marry and in
the other case they have not married, and that is precisely
the kind of statute which visits the sins of the parents
on the child by depriving the child of the benefit, the
social welfare benefit merely because of the lack of
marriage of the parents, and the bar here is absolute.
This is not a case like Lucas, where the
illegitimate child can some in and prove dependence or
%

where the child and the mother can come in and prove"
that they had actually been supported by the father of
the child at the time of his death.
QUESTION:

Isn’t the difference between the

classes — it depends on marriage, doesn’t it, not on
4

illegitimacy?
MR. SEMMEL:
case in all --

That is almost Invariably the

QUESTION:
amples here.

Well, you have dreamed up some ex­

Suppose a man lives with a woman and has a

child but they aren't married and. then for some reason
they have a divorce, an agreed upon divorce, at least
they cease living together, and then he marries another
woman and then h® dies and the woman has been taking care
of his illegitimate child before he died.

Now, I take it

she is entitled to benefits and the child is, too?
MR. SEMMEL:
QUESTION:

Under those unusual circumstances —
Well, you call them unusual.

It Is

no more unusual than the one you dreamed up.
MR. SEMMEL:
QUESTION:

Well, I am not —
Anyway, the answer Is yes?

MR. SEMMEL:

The answer is, yes, that under

those circumstances —
QUESTION:
MR. SEMMEL:

Somebody gets —
— the wife who has a child of

her husband, it is not her own, would receive benefits —
QUESTION:

So the line isn't drawn on illegiti­

macy?
MR. SEMMEL:

The line is drawn on illegitimacy

if we define the class, Mr. Justice White, which is —
the class is children living — the general classification
is children living with their mothers which encompasses
almost all children.

1 believe only yesterday, Mr.

19
Justice Stevens, in his dissent in the Cabban case, noted
that virtually all children live with their mothers.

The

example which you pose is kind of an exception to the
normal living pattern.

So the general classification is

children living with their mothers and then all illegiti­
mate chi3.dren are barred from the benefit because their
mothers haven't married the father.

All legitimate

children living with their mothers receive the benefits —
QUESTION:

But you are using your definition of

the class in effect to explain how the statute operates,
and actually your definition of the class is narrower
than the operation of the statute.
MR. S EMM EL:

The definition of class in some

respects is narrower in every possible application of the
statute.

But in ©very illegitimacy case that has been

before this Court virtually in which the discrimination
has been stricken, there has been some group of illegitimate
children who qualify and this Court has always looked at
the class by comparing legitimate children and illegitimate
children similarly situated.
QUESTION:

I just gave you some illegitimate

children who were not excluded from this benefit,
MR. SEMMEL:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
And any man who has been living with

the woman and they are not married and she dies and they

20
had children, It could very easily end up in the situation
I Just mentioned to you.
MR. SEMMEL:

That is correct.

But w© have had

other cases in this Court in which some illegitimate
children were not excluded from benefitss but the Court
nevertheless held that discrimination between legitimate
children and illegitimate children similarly situated was
unconstitutional.

In the Weber case, for example, in­

volving workmen’8 compensation benefits, legitimate
children and acknowledged illegitimate children received
benefits, other illegitimate children did not and the
Court held that that discrimination was unconstitutional.
In Jimenez case, we had legitimate children and
illegitimate —some classes of illegitimate children
receiving he refits, other illegitimate children did not,
and again this Court held by looking at illegitimate
children and legitimate children similarly situated, that
there was an unconstitutional discrimination.
In fact, in every case involving the Social
Security Act, there are always some illegitimate children
who receive benefits because there is a provision in the
Act that children who are illegitimate solely because of
a defect in a bona fide marriage between their parents
are considered legitimate.

So we always have some

illegitimate children receiving benefits, yet this Court

21

in two definite situations has stricken discrimination

,

j

-. v

*

ag'a'ihst1 'illfegitimat© children in the Social Security Act,
and that is true in almost every other kind of case in
which this Court has found discrimination against
illegitimate children.
There have been some, in some cases the number
may be small, in others the number may b© large, in which
some illegimato children have gottern benefits.
We would submit Vthat here the crucial distinetion which relates to this entire argument of the govern­
ment on the likelihood of support, if the Court examines
the Jimenez case on the one hand and the Lucas case on
the other hand and similarly, in a different context,
■?

'

.

T

Trimble v. Gordon on the one hand and Lalli v. Lalli on
the other hand, th© distinctic-n

is the absolute bar based

on the failure of the mother and father to marry.
So if this was a statute as we had in Lucas,
in which the family could come in and have an opportunity
to demonstrate that in fact there was support for th©:
family, that would be a different case and might be proper
and constitutional under Lucas, because what Lucas and
Jimenez illustrate is that the likelihood of support argu­
ment sustains differentia! treatment only in presuming
that all legitimate children are supported but requiring
an additional showing by illegitimate children, but that

22
it does not sustain an absolute bar to Illegitimate chil­
dren in a particular category.

i

QUESTION:

Mr. Semmel, if I understand you cor­

rectly, you ar© saying that this statute, what you consider
a constitutional defect in the statute would be cured if
the mother, the unmarried mother were given the opportunity
to prove that at the time of the wage earner’s death she
was receiving support of the wage earner?
MR. SEMMEL:

I believe that that is the holding

In the Lucas ease.
*

QUESTION:

Now, if you concede that and if there

were emperical evidence that Congress considered — and. I
don’t know whether there is or net — that that is true in
only 2 percent of the cases of unmarried; mothers, most
•‘■unmarried mothers who have not been living with the wage
earner for a matter of years prior to his death are not
then receiving his support, then I would think you would
have to admit that this classification was a rational
classification.
MR, SEMMEL:

We would not concede that, Your

Honor, as long as the touchstone was illegitimacy, that
QUESTION:
stone is marriage.

But the touchstone isn’t.

The touch-

The outer limit of the class is was

the person ever married to the wage earner.

And if you

concede that this would be saved by making special

23

provision for those mothers of Illegitimate children who
could prove actual dependence, then it seems to me your
argument must really rely on an assumption that a very
significant portion of the members of your class were in
fact receiving support from the wage earner at the time
of death.

And you didn’t even allege that as to your

client^ as 1 remember the pleadings.
MR, SEMMEL:

Your Honor, the pleadings don’t

allege that because the case cams up on a review of the
determination of the Social Security Administration).
'

i

QUESTION:
MR. SEMMEL:

!

Yes.
Because of the marriage require­

ment , any question of "support became irrelevant and there­
fore no evldenc® was submitted in the administrative
process and none would have been relevant had it been
offered.

/
Wo would submit that not only Isn’t there any

empirical evidence but that the statutory history shows
that Congress never had that in mind at all.
QUESTION:

Well, it would have been relevant in

the District Court, would it not?

You say this isn’t just

simply a denial of a benefit you are appealing from or
you might well be precluded by one of the preclusion
sections.

If you are challenging the constitutionality

of a provision, I would think the sort of evidence that

you and Justice Stevens had your colloquy about would have
been admissible.
QUESTION:

At least you would have to make some

effort to show that Congress was quite irrational in ever
having thought what the government suggests it thought
?

about —
MR. SEMMEL:
to that.

Well, I think there are two answers

One is that statutory history shows that Congress

was Irrational in the sense that they were acting out of
an intent to exelude illegitimate children as part of a
general statutory purpose of discrimination against
illegitimate children
QUESTION:

Wall, if you are right on that, the

government concedes you win, I take it.
MR, SEMMEL:
QUESTION»

I think that is correct.
If you can spell out a legislative

history of purpose to discriminate against illegitimate
children.
MR. SEMMEL: . Yes, I would like to do that, Mr.
Justice —
QUESTION:

But I take it your total argument

is that you can’t .spell that out.

You say they affect the

f

Impact on illegitimate children is sufficient to invalidate
the statute.
MR. SEMMEL:

That is correct.

We would say

either way the statute should be invalidated.

But I

would like to take perhaps the remaining moments before
they break to touch on that question of the intent of
Congress here.
If we go back to 1939 when Congress first en~
acted survivors benefits* the original Social Security
Act was simply for retirement anci then in 1939 survivors
benefits were first enacted.
children were excluded.

At that time* illegitimate

Children's benefits that were

provided were provided only for legitimate children.
The Social Security Advisory Board* beginning
in 19^0* expressed itself on that question, pointed to
the inequities and urged Congress to correct it,

It

wasn't until 1965 that Congress first moved to make some
change in the total exclusion of illegitimate children.
■But even In l$65a when they did It* they surrounded the
•

\

change with a number of discriminatory provisions.

One

of them was a provision that if by adding illegitiraate
children’s benefits to the total package on the wage
earner’s account, the total benefits would exceed the
maximum and then illegitimate children lost all their
benefits first, rather than dividing it proportionally
as in almost any other cage* and that was stricken by
this Court In the summary affirmance of both the Davis
T

and Griffin cases.

26
The second kind of discrimination was before
this Court in the Jimenes case where we were dealing with
a very small class of children born after the disability
of the father, and under the statute illegitimate children
were not entitled to benefits and legitimate children were
entitled to benefits, and this Court found that that was
unc onstitutional.
And Congress, by leaving the mother's benefit
provision with a marriage requirement continued the dis­
criminatory effect of that on i!3@gltimate children that
went back to 1939 when illegitimate children were totally
excluded from the statute.

And it made sense, of course,

to Congress to use the term widows because it was only
widows and legitimate children that were involved in the
benefit package at all, but that form of discrimination
carries over along with these other requirements.
Again, the provision in the Act that says when
legitimate children — excuse me, when illegitimate
children ere illegitimate only by reason of the invalid
but good-faith marriage of the parents, they are deemed
legitimate and the mother Is then deemed a wife under the
same circumstances.

That again I think indicates that

what we had was a general statutory schema of hostility
to children because of the failure of their parents to
marry.

Part of that has been removed by Congress and

27
part of that has been removed by this Court, and this
mother’s benefit is one of the last vestages of that
scheme.

I would just like briefly to comment on the

I think it is not accurate to state that

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

MR. S EMM EL:

Thank you., Mr. Chief Justice.

The holding of this Court, I submit, was very
clear in the Wiesenfeld case that the mother’s benefit was
Intended to benefit the child.

In fact, the government in

that case mad© the same argument that they assert here,
that this was essentially spouse's support and it was
proper for Congress to distinguish between support for
wives who are normally supported by their husbands as
contrasted to support for husbands who are often or per­
haps more often than not not supported by their wives,
and that was then asserted by the? government as the justi'fleation for the classification.

The Court’s decision

finds that the benefit was for the child and therefore
we have discrimination based on sex because women workers

do not get th© same benefits for the children a3 male
.workers would and therefor© there was implicit rejection
of the notion that the intent of the statute was for
spouse * 3 support.
Now, the fact that a marriage requirement is
used in th© statute does not mean that there is no either
intended or effect discrimination against illegitimate
children.

The very definition of an illegitimate child

30

is a child whose mother and father have not been married,
and this Court has stricken down on several occasions
statutory provisions which discriminate against illegitimate
children even though -QUESTION:

it correct to say that here the person who is being dis­

MR. SEMMEL:

No.

That would be the case if you

accepted the government?s notion of what this statute is
all about, mother's benefits.

Here, If you look at the

structure of the statute, we submit that it is clear, and
that is what Wiesenfeld said, that we have a discrimination
against children because the mother's benefits were intended

I think in fact-the child might

take care of the child.

MR. SEMMEL:

If the child actually has income

from earnings which exceed the earnings maximum, the
benefits to the child would be reduced, too, similarly if
the mother goes out and works, even though she is eligible
for mother’s benefits, she might not be paid any because
of the earnings test in the Social Security Act might
reduce all of her benefits to aero.

it wouldn’t be any different, would it, if you Just said
this was iritended to benefit both the mother and the child?

■t;he child.

MR.' SEMMEL:

Justice.

■

I think that is correct, Mr.

I agrcee with that, so long as one of the major

purposes is benefit for the child.

If the illegitimate

children are then deprived of that benefit, then I think
our constitution claim is sustained.
( •

35
One® we have a classification — let me Just go
back one moment and just comment again on the marriage
requirement as the classification of illegitimacy.

The

Social Security Act* for example, never speaks directly
in terms of illegitimacy versus legitimacy, but this Court
has stricken provisions of the statute on that ground.
The Social Security Act always talks in what we might call
neutral terms, which is children who Inherit on intestacy
under state law and that effectively at least until the
Trimble decision barred illegitimate chi3.dren.

Similarly

in the New Jersey Rights Organisation case, we had a
statute which provided welfare benefits to families con­
sisting of husband, wife, and children, and this Court
struck that as discrimination against illegitimate
children as well.

So there is no magic in the term

illegitimacy being written into the statute.

This Court

has always taken a look at how the statute operated in
practice.
The classification of illegitimacy then re­
quires In a constitutional test a little closer look, a
little closer scrutiny than is sometimes given to other
social welfare benefit cases.

I think this Court has

made it clear in every one of its decisions in point.
And the point that Mr. Justice Stevens raised earlier
concerning a situation in which Congress may find that

36
only 2 pereant of all mothers of illegitimate children
were supported by the father, of course, Congress has not
made that finding, there is nothing in the record, nothing
in the legislative history that indicates Congress ever
considered that, nor could it have considered that because
when

mother’s benefits were adopted, illegitimate

children were ineligible for children's benefits and there­
fore ipso facto they were also not receiving mother's
benefits and therefore Congress could not have ever taken
up this question in point' in enacting mother’s benefits.
But we would submit that even if Congress had
taken that kind of consideration, that the total exclusion
of all Illegitimate children is not justified by the
administrative convenience.

And that ivas essentially the

holding of this Court in the Jimenez case, where it was
argued that after born illegitimate children could be
excluded because relatively few children'were involved
and there was an element of administrative convenience
in proof of paternity or support, and I believe what the
cases require is a closer look at how the purpose can be
achieved.
If the purpose is to exclude families where
the father was not supporting the family, then that can
be achieved by giving the family the opportunity to prove
that they were receiving the support.

If only 2 percent

37
of the families provide that proof, then only 2 percent of
the families will get the benefit.
QUESTION:

I don’t understand the government to

be arguing it as a matter of administrative convenience,
but rather that this is a large class of persons, most of
whom probably were not receiving support from the wage
earner at the time of the wage earner’s death and there­
fore they don’t come within the notion of substituting
benefits for prior support.

I don’t think it is a matter

of administrative convenience because there are a lot of
people who might be able to prove they were getting support,
a grandmother, a third cousin, or a good friend or some­
thing who wouldn’t be eligible for social security simply
for that reason, because the social security system oper­
ates on a bunch of rules and large classes are defined in
terms of probability.
MR. SEMMEL:

That's correct, but the difference

between third cousins and grandmothers and so on and
illegitimate children is of constitutional significance
and this Court has had ten cases in which it has held
various forms of discrimination against illegitimate
children to be unconstitutional.

That is just not the

case with third cousins or grandmothers.

And when you

get to that classification, then the appropriate test is
to look carefully at the purpose to be achieved and to

38
meet that test without a total ban, total bar to benefits
for the class of illegitimate children, and that is the
failure of this statute because it bars all benefits to
illegitimate children, it bars those benefits whether or
not the father had ever supported the children, whether
the father had ever supported the mother,

and because of

that reason alone, the statute falls as unconstitutional.
In the remaining moments, I would like to com­
ment just for a moment on the class action aspect of the
case.

I did not intend to argue on the retroactivity

which I believe is well covered in the briefs.

\

'«

1

With respect to the class action, I merely want

to emphasize the limited nature of the class relief and
'

\

the importance of the class relief.

Essentially, the class

relief here merely requires the Social Security Administra-

/

■

' tion to notify all families in which illegitimate children
are receiving children’s benefits of the- decision of the
Court so that they will know that now they may come in and
apply.

They will still have to meet all of the other

statutory requirements for mother's benefits.

They will

still have to -QUESTION:

And that is based on 1331, isn’t it?

That is the only way you can get that kind of relief?
MR. SEMMEL:

We would submit that we can obtain

it either on 1331, if 205(h) is not a bar to that —

39
QUESTION:

Didn't we hold in Salfi that it was

a bar?
MR. SEMMEL:

In Salfi the Court — Salfi in­

volved a decision which ordered the payment of benefits to
all members of the class.
QUESTION:

And didn't we say you couldn't bring

that under 1331 by reason of the preclusionary provision?
MR. SEMMEL:

That's correct, but 1 submit that

the difference is that 205(h) is the counterpart to 205(g)
which provides for judicial review of claims for benefits.
And what 205 precludes is a claim that is revlewable under
205(g).

There is no way that either the appellees here or

any other potential recipient could file a "claim" with
the Social Security Administration asking the administra­
tion to notify all the class members, and that is why we
need the Jurisdiction of the federal courts under 1331 — QUESTION:

Well, lots of people need the juris­

diction of the federal courts but they don't get it because
Congress hasn't given It to them.
MR. SEMMEL:

That's correct, but here Congress

has provided in 1331 for federal court jurisdiction in
constitutional claims.

That is only reduced by section

205(h) to the extent that something is a claim under 205(g).
We would submit that this notice requirement is not a
claim for benefits under 205(g) and therefore not precluded

40
by 205(h).
The other side of that would be that if it is a
claim under 205(g), then the District Court had jurisdiction
under 205(g) and that a class relief is permissible under

205(g).

I know that has been submitted and argued in the

Elliot case which is awaiting decision.
QUESTION:

Those two arguments are mutually in­

consistent, aren’t they?

You can go either one or the

other but not both?
MR. SEMMEL:

That Is correct.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have anything

further, Mrs. Shapiro?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRIET S. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL
MRS. SHAPIRO:

First, just as a matter of clari­

fication, the child benefit must be used for the child.
The representative payee received the payment on behalf
of the child and is supposed to use It for the child.
The main point I want to make is that —
QUESTION:

Before you leave that, what about the

mother’s benefit?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, the mother’s benefit is for

her own use and she can use it as she wishes.
QUESTION:

I see.

MRS. SR4PIR0:

I may have misunderstood Mr.

41
White*3 question to m@ earlier.

I gather that what you

were asking was that if the Court should disagree with our
position and consider the benefit to be a child’s benefit,
what then.

The answer would be that there are really in

that case two — it is not a discrimination against
Illegitimates, if you look at it from the point of view
of the child, what the statute is doing is saying that In
the situation where the mother was not married to the wage
earner —
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro, suppose the statute

said that mothers of illegitimate children do not get these
benefits, but mothers of legitimate children do?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, then —

Would your position be the same?

It

doesn’t sound to me like it would.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Then you are saying it would be

intentional discrimination against —
QUESTION:

I thought that is all you answered,

if that kind of thing, you would agree, it is illegal.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

If it is an Intentional discrim­

ination against illegitimate children —
QUESTION:

And I take it that part of the sub-

mission of your colleague on the other side is that that
Is exactly what the statute is.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

But the problem —-

QUESTION:

Do you disagree with that?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

The question there I guess

would be that if you take that position, then is illegitimacy
a sufficiently accurate indicator of the likelihood of
lost support, so that you can ignore the possibility that
there might have been situations in xfhleh the child’s
mother — the wage earner was supporting the unmarried
mother of his children.
QUESTION:

Well, that might be almost as good

as marriage or non-marriage, wouldn't it?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, the —

I mean certainly you know that there

is not a very perfect fit in any of these classifications.
MIS. SHAPIRO:

That's true.

I guess the point

is that comparing this case with Lucas, in Lucas it was
significant that there was an opportunity to prove actual
dependence but that may well be because the chances of a
wage earner supporting his Illegitimate children is greater
than the chance that he was supporting the mother of his
illegitimafce children.

So you have a different kind of a

relationship between th© policy and the statute here than
you would there.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro, I am somewhat puzzled

by your concession that Intent makes any difference.

It

seems to me that Congress knew what it was doing in all

*

43
of these cases, and if the test were phrased In terms of
mothers of illegitimate children, the mother no longer
living with the wage earner, not having lived with the
wage earner at the time of his death, it seems to me there
would be the same probability and I guess maybe what Mr.
Justice White was implying, the same probability that the
wage earner was not supporting that particular mother
bea use you really have the same setup whether you describe
her

as the mother of an illegitimate child or as a person

that is not a wife.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, the problem — If It is the

intent to discriminate or whether it is simply a disparate
effect of the use of a perfectly proper method of distin­
guishing between people who are likely to have been sup-,
ported and people who weren’t —
QUESTION:

Well, it is always an intent to dis­

criminate if you say that Class A gets benefits and Class
B doesn’t get benefits.

You are always discriminating

intentionally against Class B, and the people In Class B,
no matter hex* you phrase the statute, are still a large
group of mothers vdio are not living with the wage earner

who happen to have children by him at some:earlier point

in time.

I

Does constitutionality depend on how they phrase

the statute?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

No, the constitutionality depends

on whether what Congress Is doing is trying to distinguish
between people who were likely to get support and who were
not.
QUESTION:

In both cases I assume they were.

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Okay.

If that is vrhat they were

doing, then the fact that this perfectly proper reasonable
statutory distinction has a disparate effect on illegitimate
children is not enough to constitute a denial of equal
protection.

That is the way we read Washington v. Davis.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
counsel.

Very well.

Thank you,
