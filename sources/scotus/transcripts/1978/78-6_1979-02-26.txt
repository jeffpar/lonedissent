Mr. Young3 you may proceed whenever you are ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OP DAVID H. YOUNG, ESQ.3
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, YOUNG:

Thank you, Mr* Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Today we are concerned with numerous sections ©f
title 2 of the Texas Family Code which is.Texas’ effort t©
deal with the law of parents and children*
tion obviously of many parts*

It is a codifica­

It in part reflects case law

as they existed prior t© its passage in 197*!o

It in part

reflects what the legislature.or what the ease law In the
absence of statute said the law was, and it al@©9 of course,
reflects changes that the legislature made in the statutes
and case law.
Those various aspects of the Family Code have an
interplay in the sections which are before you here today*
Some of the sections which we will be discussing are matters
of lax* that pertain t© virtually any case in the civil courts
in Texas, and others are sections that pertain t© the more
limited aspects of child abuse and still others are sections
which have only to do with certain instances or certain pro­
cedures in child abuse,

H
Because of the numerous chapters and sections in­
volved 9 when I am making my argument I will try to use more
than merely numbers of chapters when I am describing things.
For instances chapter 17 s I will alifays try to refer to that
as to the emergency protection provisions; chapter l1* I will
try to remember to refer t© as the conservatorship or
custody provisions; likewise,, chapter 15s termination of
parental rights; chapter 11, which Is involved her® as well9
is essentially a wholly procedural chapter; and chapter 3^
is involved as not a judicial per s@ chapter at all9 it is
really an investigative agency kind of chapter.
I would also like to utilise some ©f my time to
very briefly state what the court below held9 because we are
not appealing everything that the court below held9 and from
reading the opposing briefss it is at least my Judgment that
many of those briefs are on issues that are not before this
Court f
QUESTION:

Is it possible t© briefly state what the

court below held?
MR. YOUNG:

I hop® so.

I want to try.

I think it

is difficult and I certainly d©n@t want to use up all ©f my
time doing it.
First of alls of course9 the abstention issue we
clearly ar® appealing.

They held section 111$ 9 a procedural

statut39 unconstitutional on its face because it failed to

5
require an attorney

ad litem for a child in any suit affect-»

Ing a child under the emergency statute6 conservator statutes
or the termination statute.

We are only appealing that as

to the necessity for an ad litem at the emergency hearing*
the chapter IT hearing.

We are not appealing it as to its

impact on any of the other proceedings, whether for conserva­
torship or permanent or temporary basis or termination»
Three held in three sections* 1111, !?0S and 1706,
that all were unconstitutional* as failing t© require an
adversary hearing within ten days of the emergency, taking of
a child»

W© are not appealing any of those»
They held

section 1115 unconstitutional on its

face as to the standard of proof* saying clear and convincing
evidence was required* instead of preponderance®

Me are

appealing that.
They held „ ■

section 1702 unconstitutional In

that — saying it was unconstitutional on its face* but saying
that immediately —» the statute says a child that is seised
will immediately be taken before a court or the agency
seising the child will immediately obtain a judicial sanction*
if you will, to have possession of a child.

They interpreted

that to mean that immediately is the %ery day"of the taking.
We are appealing that limited aspect of the holding.
They said that 1703 is unconstitutional on its face
in that it fails to require all reasonable efforts to serve

6
notice of one of these suits.

We are not appealing that and

we would frankly characterize that as one of the more
gratuitous holdings of the court b@Xow3 because there is no
question that all reasonable efforts should be made and were
made in this Instance to notify the parents of the proceed™
ingss, and in fact they had actual notice®
They held that section 3^05 was unconstitutional
on Its face, as failing to require notice in a hearing for
the parents before any psychological or psychiatric examina­
tion of the children®

We are not appealing that®

wasn?t even at issue in this case®

That

Physical examination was

at issue in this cases and the court made n© adverse holding
as to that.
They also held the child abuse, neglect3 report
and Inquiry system unconstitutional as applied, in that the
state had provided for a central registry of cases of
suspected abuse and those cases on that registry were not
limited to instances in ihieh a judicial determination as to
the abuse had been made.
Finally, they held 3^08/unconstitutional on its

/
face, that being the confidentiality provision,, and held it
unconstitutional insofar as it did not provide for parents
to be notified of the contents of the record that the state
had on them or requiring the states upon request to reveal
the contents of the records, except for informance.

We are

7
not appealing that.
Ona other thing which is confusing,, also is that
the Woods ease, it is my understandings is not before this
Court.

It ms consolidated on a limited issue of the right

of Indigents to appointed counsel, and in their decision in
this case and in their judgments the court below said that
consolidation t^ras ill-advised.

We did not in our brief any­

way cite to you what became of that ease.

The court allowed

the state courts to proceed and in December of 1976 s some
two or three months after the decision in this case was
rendered, the Court of Civil Appeals reversed the Judgment
and restored the children to Mrs. Woods.
reported at 5^5 Southwest 2nd 573.

That decision is

The reversal was based on

an insufficiency of evidence kind of question.
That I hope gets me into what 1 would like to talk
about regarding abstenslon, because in that case, the Woods
case, the state courts were allowed to function, were allowed
to go ahead through their normal processes and what happened
is that the parents won.
To talk about abstension, it is also necessary to
spend Just a little bit of time on a chronology of the
events that occurred.
On March 25, 1976, there was a report of child
abuse at the school in question.

A Department of Human

Resources worker went there to Investigate it, md the

8
children were taken to a child welfare clinic.

The next day*

the very next day, not the very day but the very next day*
a temporary order was obtained®

The day after that* Paul

Sims, who is the subject of this litigation really, was
hospitalized where he would remain for some ten days.

On

the 5th of April, the first «—
QUESTION:
YOUNG:

It says March 31 ~

I beg: your pardon?

QUESTION:

On March 31* they went to a judge to

modify that order, didn’t they?
YOUNG:

No, Your Honor.

According to the deposition

of Judge Lowry — which I will discuss -«° they did attempt
apparently to file a motion to modify It®

It is my under­

standing that the District Clerk said that Judge Lowry was not
present, he being the judge which had entered the temporary
emergency order a few days before that, and went to see
another judge to see if he would hear it.

He evidently said

he did not want to hear it* and they left.
QUESTION:

This is not the only point that is not

clear in this case.
MR,. YOUNG:

That8s right.

That is why I am taking

some time to gc through it In the first place®

On the 5th*

however* Judge Lowry was around and a hearing was had in his
court room®

The 5th was the ninth day of the duration of

the ten-day emergency order.

At that time* the plaintiffs

9
below had pending a habeas corpus action and a hearing was
conducted at the bench, if you will.

All this is explained

in some detail in Judge Lowry’s deposition.

And the motion

to modify was never mentioned to him at that time9
QUESTION;

When you say a habeas corpus action,, a

state habeas action?
ME. YOUNG:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
The initial order was a state court

order, was it not?
MR. YOUNG:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Was that entered in any pending proceed­

ing that actually had been brought?
MR. YOUNG:

Yes.

The proceeding -- there were two

state court proceedings before the federal court hearing on
the —
QUESTION:

Briefly can you tell us what those were?

MR. YOUNG:

Yes.

The first one was the one that I

mentioned on the 2?th.
QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

Brought by whom?
Brought by the state — I*ve forgotten

the name of the individual who signed the complaint, but It
was brought by the state.

This was the day after the

children were picked up at school.
QUESTION:

They were in foster eare«

So this was a state agency, a proceeding

brought by a state agency?

10
MR. YOUNG;
QUESTION;
MR, YOUNG;

Yes.
And who were the defendants?
The Sims, the parents.

QUESTION;

That is one,

MR. YOUNG;

That9g one.

QUESTION;
MR, YOUNG;

What is the next one?
The next one was as a result of this

hearing on the 5th in Judge Lowry9s court, wherein the motion
for habeas was pending, also that was onthe 9th or the 10th
clay, I’vs forgotten which, of this ten-day order.

Questions

as to venue of these proceeding were presented,
QUESTION;
MR, YOUNG;

Who brought the second proceeding?
The second proceeding was brought during

a continuance of this hearing.
10:30 in the morning.

The hearing was convened at

As a result of the hearing, Judge Lowry

had substantial questions as to venue of these proceedings In
his mind.

It was discussed by counsel for both parties

before the court and he said he will recess this hearing
until 5;00 o’clock to give the parties, both parties an oppor­
tunity to file whatever it is they are going to file.

As a

result of that, at four-something, the state filed a second
suit.
QUESTION:
MR, YOUNG:
QUESTION;

In the same county or different?
In Harris County, the same county.
The same county.

11
MR. YOUNG:

And as a result of that second —-

QUESTION?

Naming again the Sims as defendants?

MR. YOUNG:

Yes.

As a result of the second suit,

the judge took official cognizance, if you will, of the venue
issue, transferred that second suit to Montgomery County and
transferred with It the habeas action on which no action had
been taken.
QUESTION:
MRo YOUNG:
QUESTION:

Who brought the habeas action?
The 3Iras0
The Sims.

So we have three proceedings

pending before anyone went into federal court?
MRo YOUNG:

You could, even say four, if you wanted,

because at some point the Sims also brought or attempted to
bring an original habeas action I believe in the Court of
Civil Appeals, which is an intermediate court, which they
refused to take, there having been no decision below*
QUESTION:

But they didn’t succeed in getting in,

did they?
MR„ YOUNG:

They didn’t succeed but, as 1 understand

it, that is not the question0
QUESTION:

No*

What I am trying to get at is the

actual pending state proceedings, were there two brought by
the state agency, both in Harris County, one transferred to
some other -■»
t •

MR. YOUNG:

Montgomery County*

12
QUESTIONs

Montgomery County — and the habeas pro­

ceeding brought by the Sims in Harris County, also transferred
to Montgomery, is that it?
MR. YOUNG:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
Now, the initial order was entered in

that first state agency proceeding, was it?
MR0 YOUNG:
QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

Yes,
I see,
And that order, pursuant to chapter 17,

was good for only ten days, in this subsequent hearing that
we are talking about, not an ex parte hearing, as the first
one had been, when the order was obtained,
QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

That was on the ninth day?
It was on the 5th, so it should be the

ninth day, which Is why I think he said he gave them until

5:00 o’clock to get whatever additional pleadings, motions
they would have.
tenth day.

That order expired by its own terms on the

After that tenth day, there was nothing possible

further to do, so —
QUESTION:

But the proceeding In which that order

■was entered was not; terminated, with the expiration of the
order, did it?
MRo YOUNG:

Well, that is a very close question and

I think that is why the second proceeding was filed seeking
temporary conservatorship and why it is that proceeding that

13
was transferred along with the habeas to Montgomery Countys
QUESTION:

Well, let me put it to you this way:

In

your abstension argument, what state proceedings as pending
do you rely upon?
MR. YOUNG:

We allege that chapter 17 was filed

before any proceedings of substance on the merits in federal
court.
QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

Well, don't confuse me with these numbers
I'm sorry, I said I would try not fcoe

The first one —
QUESTION:
MR0 YOUNG:

What was the first state proceeding?
The emergency proceeding filed the day

after the child was picked up0
QUESTION:

That was pending, you say, when the

federal suit was brought?
MRo YOUNG:

You said earlier —

We argue that»

It is a question of

Montgomery County adjoins Harris on the

tell one from the other.
QUESTION:

1

You can’t

It is all urban.

Is it perfectly clear that the second

proceeding was pending,, because the order was entered9 as my
notes show9 on April 6th and It wasnet until April 19th that
the federal case was filed 9 and there is more than a ten-day
gap and anything — was that another ten-day order that
expired by Its terms?
MR. YOUNG:

That gets to — that Is was subsequently

Interpreted to be by the federal court.

It was not clear from

the statute that it would expire after ten days»

The state

didn’t believe —
QUESTION:
MR0 YOUNG:

If you so view it *—
The state didn’t believe it would expire

after ten days, but we are not appealing that aspect»
QUESTION:

If you so view its that would have no more

15
been pending than the first one.

They would be in precisely

the same status, wouldn't they?
MR. YOUNG:

Oh, yes, because I distinguish between

a pending lawsuit and an order that is in effect.

It

wouldn’t be necessary for any order to be in effect to have a
pending lawsuit in state court, If my understanding is correct.
QUESTION:

Well, couldn't the other side argue that

after the ten days had run on, say, April l6th, that you
retained custody of the children without any legal support
for what you are doing?
MR,, YOUNG:

Oh, they did and that is what they did

argue on April 5th in the hearing in federal court, whereupon
we said, accepting that

» we didn't use these word3, but

accepting that as given, then can we go file another lawsuit
in Montgomery County and get all this cleared up, and It wa.s
our understanding that the managing judge said yes3 whereupon
we did on May 14th, whereupon the Sims absented themselves
from anywhere where they could, be served with the writ of
attachment that went x^ith that case but somehow mysteriously
they must have learned about it because they returned to
federal court on the 21st seeking a temporary restraining
order against the attachment.

That hearing, by the way,

which was not — it was some 16 days after the Attorney
General’s office and the other defendants had entered an
appearance of some sort anyway in that hearing in federal

16
eourtj and we were never notified of the application for a
temporary restraining order, there was no hearing conducted
on it9 but It was granted.
QUESTION:

If you rely on the May 14th action, a new

suit brought then,, that is almost a month after the federal
case had been filed»
MR. YOUNG:

That's right, and it is that aspect of

the confusion why in our abstension argument we put it under
several different sections and dealt with Hicks v» Miranda
kind of an issue of whether a federal case — whether a state
court proceeding has to be pending before there are substan­
tial proceedings on the merits in federal court as a separate
issue»
QUESTION:
MR» YOUNG:
QUESTION:

Well, the case ~
We say we would have it either day»
On the temporary restraining order you

weren't notified, but you were notified after it was granted?
MR. YOUNG:
QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

Oh, sure.
You would know about that»
Without question.

The effect of that

temporary — the relief that had been sought immediately as a
result of that second suit in Montgomery County was to have
the child placed with his maternal grandparents where he had
been staying a good part of the time anyway and where he had
•; f• t

been going to school, because they

':— ..«rr-xs Councy»

17
So somehow while absenting themselves from the
prospects of service, the Sims did find out obviously and
seek out soma relief from the state court action.
I mentioned earlier the confusion that results be­
cause the Family Code contains different things, and one of
the things that is so confusing in the first federal court
hearing is the distinctions between venue and jurisdiction on
the one hand and the Family Code’s concept of continuing
jurisdiction on the other.
The Sims argued in the state court that there xfas no
continuing jurisdiction in that case in Harris County and
therefore it should be dismissed.

Well, continuing jurisdic­

tion didn't have anything to do with this case»

There was no

proceeding already pending in Harris County which would have
been sufficient to give a Montgomery County court continuing
jurisdiction, because, as I say, there was no case pending in
Montgomery County to which the Harris County court would have
to have referred it back.
What the Harris County court did was take these
arguments that both sides were making, i.e„, the fact that
the children and the parents both resided in Montgomery
County, and realised that mandatorlly under the Family Code
that meant venue was in Montgomery County, and while he did
have jurisdiction, he did have jurisdiction and he says xn
his deposition that it is sufficient to enter the show cause

18
order that he did and transfer it back.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Young, you have only

got a couple of minutes left, and you had better get to the
heart of your case.
MRe YOUNG:

Okay.

Maybe the last thing 1 had better

say about abstenslon is that Hicks does away with this9
Hicks v. Miranda in our view does away with the race to the
courthouse theory.

There is no issue that all the parties

had actual notice in federal court of what the state intended
to do.

It was explicitly addressed to the judge9 and we

think he consented in effect to it,

In any event, there is

no finding below of the kind of bad faith or harassment that
would be necessary to overcome abstenslon.
a bad faith allegation in the pleadings.

There is not even
There is one harass­

ment allegation as to the last proceeding in Montgomery
County.

No findings below about bad faith or harassment,

and we are the appellant and they are not,
I realized I have used up virtually all of my time
on only one of the three big issues of the case,

I can't

really address the other two in the remaining time, so I
would like to just reserve the remainder of my time.

Absten­

slon will solve all the other issues if it is decided our way
anyway9 sc I would just like to reserve the rest of my time.
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MS. PORTER:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court —
QUESTION:

Ms. Porter, at some time, perhaps the

earlier the better, it would be interesting to me to have you
give me your version of the facts very briefly»
MS. PORTER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir»
What happened?

When was this child

picked up and why, and then how soon after that were these
proceedings begun?
MS. PORTER:

All right, sir, I will do that.

Let me

state at the outset, sir, that we realise and we submit and
acknowledge that there is a compelling state interest in a
state being able to pick up children in emergency situations.
QUESTION:

Do you concede that this was an emer­

gency?
MS. PORTER:
an emergency»

Mo, sir, I do not concede that this Is

What we concede to, sir, is that there is an

interest here on the part of the state that if in fact there
were any children at any particular time, now or even then,
in danger of any harm, that that state has an interest in
being able to take those children into custody.
QUESTION:

And primarily that is a matter for the

20
state courts, is it not?
MS» PORTER:

That particular ~ yes, sir, is»

What

we are concerned about is what happened after the children
were taken into custody»
QUESTION:

Why was this particular child picked up?

MSo PORTER:

All right, sir.

On March 25th ~ just

briefly — a referral was made to the Child Welfare Depart­
ment, the child was picked up, three of the children were
picked up, not just Paul»
to Paul»

The referral was only In respect

On March 26th there was a suit that was filed for

protection of the child, supposedly with a referral only as
to Paul9 the suit was filed in relationship to all three of
the children.

On March 26th, the first ex parte order was

issued by the judge.
QUESTION:

How soon after they were taken Into

custody was there a medical examination?
MS. PORTER:

Sir, the children were taken to the

hospital that very day.
QUESTION:

Are these pictures in the appendix, are

those pictures, were they taken that very day?
MS, PORTER:
pictures were takem.

Your Honor, I do not know when those
Those pictures were stipulated into

I would assume — and usually in the regular course

of business, when Child Welfare picks up the children, the
pictures are usually taken at that same time, but this is just

21
something —
QUESTION:

A picture of one child or of all three,

these pictures?
M3. PORTER:

Sir, I believe that those pictures are

only of one child.
QUESTION:

Yes„

MS, PORTER:

It is difficult to determine whether

or not some of them are of all three, but I believe that they
are only as to the one child and that is to the boy child,
Paul 9
QUESTION:

They are rather telling, aren't they,

exhibits of child abuse?
QUESTION:

Were they not buttressed also by the

doctor's examination which said that there had clearly been a
case of child abuse?
MS. PORTER:

Your Honor, they were buttressed by an

affidavit by the doctor,

However, there was never any testi-

mony because there was never any court hearing.

Usually,

what occurs is when these particular suits are filed ,there
is usually an affidavit presented to the judge by the social
worker or by the attorney from Child Welfare which states
what the result of the doctor's examination is.
On March 31i>t, the appellees went in and sought to
modify the March 26th ox parte order.
longer than ten dayss

That order lasted no

After the expiration of that order,

22
pursuant to the Texas Family Codes the judge liras to do either
one of two things, order the children restored to the parents
or direct Child Welfare or its attorneys to file -a suit
affecting the parent-child relationship.

On March 31st, the

appellees went into court to file a writ of habeas corpus.
I'm sorry, I left out one fact about the March 31st
order.

The motion to modify, they were not even allowed to

file that particular motion, and we feel that that was
effectively denying them any particular access.
QUESTION:
MS. PORTER:

Wasn't it that the judge wasn't there?
Sir, in the request for admissions, it

states and admits that the motion was stamped by the clerk.
They said that the judge was not there, but then the motion
was returned back to appelleesThey were not even allowed
to file It, to leave it there and to set a hearing for
another time.
QUESTION:
MSo PORTER:

Is that clear?
I believe, sir, that it is clear from

the request for admissions that are in the appendix.
QUESTION:
MS. PORTER:
mony.

That they weren't permitted to file?
It Is not clear, sir, from any testi­

It Is just that —
QUESTION:
MS. PORTER:
QUESTION:

The courthouse was open —
Yes, sir.
— and if they tended a paper with the

23
right feess couldn’t they file any paper?
MS» PORTER:

Supposedly, sir, they were supposed to

be able to file.
QUESTION:

Maybe, supposedlys it is either permissible

or not.
MS, PORTER:

Sir, they should have been able to file

it, however —
QUESTIOH:
MS,, PORTER:

Well, were they?
No, sir, they were not permitted to

file.
QUESTION:

Well, why were they denied the right to

file?
MS. PORTER:

I do not know, sir.

The judge was not
i

there.
QUESTION:

Is there anyting in the record to show

that they were denied the right to file?
MS. PORTER:
QUESTION:

No, sir, only the written —
Well, hoif can we take your word for it if

it is not in the record?
MSo PORTER:

Let me say this, sir, only the

admittance that it was stamped and returned to the attorney
for appellees,
stamped

and the usual practice is that if it is

it is received, and if the judge is not there then

what they would do would be to set a hearing on it later on.
The writ of habeas corpus was filed on March 31st.

The writ

24
was denied,
said

The judge would not rule on the writ because he

he lacked jurisdiction because the appellees were

residents of Montgomery County.

On that same day9 sir, later

on, another suit was filed concerning — affecting the
parent-ichild relationship.

That suit, along with the writ of

habeas corpus, was what was transferred to Montgomery County,
QUESTION:

Which writ of habeas corpus, the one

that you didn't file?
MS, PORTER:

The one, sir, of March 31st that the

judge refused to act on, sir,
QUESTION:

Well, how could you do that if it hadn't

been filed?
MS, PORTER:

MS, PORTER:
QUESTION:

No, sir,

What the court refused --

habeas corpus.

Let me see if I can clarify this.
The March 31st order was not a writ of

That motion was a motion to modify the March

26th ex parte order where the judge took custody of the
children for the ten-day period.

After not being permitted

25
to have a hearing on the March 31st motion to modify the
March 26th ex parte order, they then went back and attempted
to file a writ of habeas corpus., because at that time the
ex parte order pursuant to the Texas Code of Civil Pro­
cedure had expired because it only lasts for ten days.

After

refusing to rule on the writ because of lack of jurisdiction,
then the case was transferred to Montgomery County, along
with a second suit that was filed on the very same day that
the parents were in court trying to have a hearing on the
writ of habeas corpus.,

All of this was transferred to

Montgomery County on April Sth.
It is really interesting to note that, although the
parents had been in the court room, that there was still no
effort to even notify them about the second ex part hearing
order that was issued; further, that that order stated that
a show cause hearing would be held, but it stated in blank,
it didn’t say when, where, who or what.
notified of that order.

They were never

They were never notified of that

particular suit, for whatever reasons.
The appellees filed their original complaint in
federal court on April 19th«,

It is our contention that there

vt&s no pending state court proceeding in which the appellees
could have litigated their constitutional claims by way of a
defense.
QUESTION:

They couldn’t have in Montgomery County?

26
MS. PORTER ;

Sirs there was no action, although it

was transferreda there was no action taken by the Montgomery
County court to st

a hearing®

QUESTION;
MS. PORTER;

Well, could they have asked for it?
Your Honor, as far as I know and from

the record, they made attempts to ask for a hearing®
QUESTION:
MS. PORTER;

Where do we find that in the record?
It is purely speculative, sir®

It is

not — they talk about the people going from one place- to
another and trying to find out what was happening in Mont­
gomery County.
QUESTION;
MS® PORTER;

Were those ex part® orders appealable?
No, sir, they were not appealable®

They are interloccutory decisions.

And further, as a matter

of Texas state law, if a person wants to raise questions
concerning the constitutionality of seizure of children, they
cannot raise it even on appeal, and the case is In Re; R.E.W.
We believe that this Court’s ruling in Gersteln v.
Pugh is applicable in this particular case.

There was no­

where for thorn to go.
QUESTION;

You mean there is no court in Texas that

would entertain a claim that the children were unconstitution­
ally seized and retained by the state?
MS. PORTER;

Your Honor, the only thing that they

would have been able to do — and they would not have been

27
able to raise their constitutional questions or the issues
of constitutional law in either a writ of mandamus or a writ
of habeas corpus

„

which are the two things

QUESTION:

Why not?

MSa PORTER:

Because the writ of mandamusa sira

would have dealt xd.th whether or not the relief sought or
whether or not there was an abuse of discretion say, if a
writ of mandamus had been filed for the clerk not receiving
the motion to modify or for the judge not having a hearing
on the motion to modify.

And of course, the writ of habeas

corpus would only deal with who had legal custody*
QUESTION:
remedy at that point?

Well9 wouldn’t that have been a sufficient
The question was whether the state of

Texas had lawful custody5 and your clients said the state does
not have lawful custody, and why couldn't you raise all of
the constitutional questions in that proceeding?
MS* PORTER:

Let me state this, sir:

On May 4th

they made another attempt for a motion for leave to file a
writ of habeas corpus to the Texas Court ©f Civil Appeals,
and that motion for leave to file the writ of habeas corpus
was denied*

Because, sir, as the statute permits,

they chose to file the writ of habeas corpus with the Court
of Civil Appeals which had jurisdiction over the Montgomery
County court3 since they are all in the same area..
QUESTION?

Did it have jurisdiction over that case?

Didn't it tell you it didn't have jurisdiction?

There is no opportunity there for the

this matter could not have been settled in

the

state courts where custody of children is normally the kind
of problems that are settled there. Up to this point, I
haven't any idea why a federal court should be in this case
at all,
MS. PORTER:

Your Honor., the reasons are because

there was no pending action.

Both of the orders had expired.

The Montgomery County court, although they were bound to have
a show cause hearing within ten days — and I would say even
the Harris County court would be bound, since it was the
judge in Harris County who issued that ex parte order and the
shoitf cause hearing, that those are the reasons why it could
not be resolved.

There ivas nothing there, sir.

QUESTION:

Well, I confess, I can’t escape the feel­

ing on this record, including the reading of the opinion of
the United States District Court, that some people were more
interested in a constitutional case than in trying to do
something to take care of these children.

35
MS. PORTER;

1 do not have any knowledge3 sir, of

whether or not that is true»

It just appears to me that the

state g with all of Its resoui’ees, were putting the burden on
the appellees to raise or to find ways of having a hearing.
There were a total of 42 days here that transpired.

hearing that was held was the one on April 5th in which the
case was transferred from Harris to Montgomery County»

37

QUESTION:

By that time, they probably were healed

of the very serious wounds that are shown in these photo­
graphs .
MS, PORTERs

Your Honor, I would like to point out

that in the District Court’s opinion, the court does state
that there was never any evidence to show as to whether or
not there was any abuse by the parents«

One of the things

that happened immediately before the referral was made was
that the father was at the school and he saw the child poking
a pencil

at a little girl and he told him to stop, and Paul,

the child, did not stop, and he paddled the child in the
presence of the teacher®
Now, Paul has stated

and this is not in the

record — that he was paddled after his father left by the
teacher who wanted to paddle him some more.

And I would just

once again say that there was no determination by the Federal
District Court and no evidence presented as to whether or not
there was any child abuse, and I suppose that would ba some­
thing that would be at issue in any pending state litigation.
Let me say this on the Woods case, if I may:

I know

what has become of the Woods case, because 1 represent Miss
Woods,

Again, after the Court of Civil Appeals returned the

child. Child Welfare reinstituted an action against her, and
that case is now pending, there is a final hearing now pending
in that ease

38
QUESTION?

In federal court or state court?

MS» PORTER:

In state court, sir.

The other thing that -- the other reason why a writ
of habeas corpus or any remedy, say, if there had been any
pending proceeding, would not be available was because in
Texas by statute the ex parte orders may be stacked.

In other

words, if on® goes into court and obtains a restraining order
or an ex parte order, the statute fails to say how many you
can have.

However, appellants had conceded t© that fact and

they are not contesting that, but that was one of the things
that was at issue at that particular time, because the court
at that tim® and not made a determination as to whether or
not the stacking, where one order could be issued immediately,
almost after another order had been expired, was unconstitu­
tional either on its face or as applied„
The other thing is

and I think that what has

happened with Miss Woods is that this shows the likelihood of
what may reoccur again.

This is not an isolated instance®

Appellants stated that the children are presented to the court.
They are not presented to the court.

There was no presenta­

tion here.
As I said before, we are not saying that if in the
event that there Is child abuse the children should not be
taken into custody»

But we are hoping and we are saying that

should they be taken into custody, that because of the

39
fundamental rights involved,, because of the reciprocal rights
between parents and children,, that a hearing should be held.,
and that hearing should be held immediately in order to make
some determination as te whether or not there is any validity,

court didn’t do it.
With regard to the question of the motion to modify
the appellants didn’t have anything t© do with that.

The

appellants are not the judge nor are they the District Clerk.
The normal procedure in Texas is that you file a pleading
that requires a hearing, as that would, and you go to the
judge.
Now, any judge that was there in Harris County
could have heard It.

It was true apparently that the judge

that was there was reluctant to hear it, but there is no in­
dication whatsoever that appellees went to him and asked him
to hear it.

There is no indication.

All the evidence is to

the contrary, that they fled Montgomery County to keep from
having a hearingB

They said there was no hearing where they

could raise all their issues.

wanted was a hearing in Montgomery County.

acted on?

Was it aver denied?
MR® YOUNG;

No,

The normal course in Te^as is that

if someone files a petition asking for relief, they go to the
judge, to the clerk and get a hearing on it®

The Sims filed

that petition and never asked for a hearing as far as 1 am
aware„
QUESTION:
MR® YOUNG;
QUESTION;

S© it is still sitting there?
It is still there.
Of course, if the children were held —

MR® YOUNG;

They were returned so long ago that It

Is problematical whether we could do anything about it now.
QUESTION;
MR® YOUNG:

It is moot now, isn't it?
That is one of our contentions, yes,

that the passage of time has just — we didn’t ask for termin­
ation in the first place.

When we were only seeking temporary

48
conservatorship of a child to try to give him some help while
he needs ±ta then once the time is past where he needs it,
there is not much point in our trying to do anything®
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* counsel®

The

case is submitted.
(Whereupong at 2:05 ofclock p»m„g the ease in the
