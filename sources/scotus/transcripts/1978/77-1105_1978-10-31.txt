ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN W. LUBELL, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LUBELLs

Mr. Chief Justice» and may it please

the Court;
This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit, reversing a discovery order
of the district court and establishing an absolute privilege
of non-disclosure of the editorial process.
This is a Sullivan defamation case.

It arises

from

a CBS 60 Minutes program produced by Barry Lando and Mike
Wallace.
In that program the plaintiff. Colonel Herbert, was
portrayed as a liar, as one capable of committing acts of
brutality in Vietnam, as an opportunist who had used the
war crimes charge to cover up his own relief from command,
and as a perpetrator of a hoax on the American public.
Plaintiff, after the broadcast, brought the libel
action which is now before this Court.
During the course of pretrial, plaintiff sought to
discover what the defendants had done and learned in the

4
cw 4

course of their investigation preparing for the program, and
what the defendants' state of mind was on the matters which
they had investigated and learned about during that investigation.
Questions were posed within that context to Mr.
Land© and Mr. Wallace as to what their state of mind was as to
matters actually presented on the program as well as matters
not presented on the program and contradictory to matters
presented on the program.
QUESTION;

Counsel, you say their state of mind as

to matters.
MHo LUBELLs
QUESTION;

Yes.
Could you be a little more precise.

What

issue were you directing -- would those ansx^ers have been
relevant?
MR. LUBELL;

The issue, the legal issue we were

directed to was the issue of the subjective state of mind of
the defendants, whether in fact they entertained serious
doubts as to the truth of matters presented on the program.
Specifically, it arose in various contexts.

For

example, during the deposition of Mr. Lando we ascertained
that he had interviewed — one example —■ a group of five
different soldiers who had served x^ith Colonel Herbert in
Vietnam.

Four of those soldiers told him certain

things

about Colonel Herbert’s treatment in regard to the Vietnamese
population

5

w 5

A fifth soldier told him a contrary story»

Mr.

Land© presented on the program only the statements of the
fifth soldier, and failed to include on the program any
reference to the statements of the four other soldiers which
indicated the car® and concern that Colonel Herbert had
shown while he served in Vietnam.
QUESTIONs

And the point of this is directed at what?

at the presence or absence of malice?
MR. LOBELL:
QUESTION:
MR. LUBELL:

Yes, it is.
That should be our focus, should it not?
Yes, within the absence of actual —

presence or absence of actual malice within the reckless
disregard branch of that actual malice definition.
As this Court has developed that —
QUESTIONs

You mean there was no inquiry on the

other arm of knowing falsehood?
MR. LUBELL:

Knowing falsehood issues, we have asked

questions of Mr. Lando regarding knowledge of certain things
which were directly contrary to matters presented on the
program which indicate a knowledge of the falsehood of
certain matters.
In fact, Mr. Lando has answered those questions.
The concrete posture of the questions which have not been
answered is, all of those questions appear to regard the
reckless disregard branch, although our same arguments would

6

apply to his state of mind on the knowledge of the falsity -QUESTION?

Yes, but are you telling us that he did

answer questions directed to knowing falsity of some of the
things that were shown on the program?
MR, LUBELL?
QUESTION?

He answered questions —■
But you can illustrate, for example?

MR. LUBELL:

He answered questions -- for example,

on the program Mike Wallace stated that nobody that they
interviewed told them that Colonel Herbert had reported any
of the war crimes while .in Vietnam,
He produced, during the depositions, sworn statements
of a Captain Jack Donovan, which stated that Captain Donovan
was present at brigade headquarters when Colonel Herbert was
reporting the killings of the Vietnamese

at

Cu Loi on

February 14th, 1969.
He produced those documents.
about those documents.

We asked him questions

We did not specifically ask

the question,

did he know that what was stated on the program was false.
So that question is not before the Court as such.
In terms of questions that he did ansv/er during the
depositions, Mr. Lando as well as Mr. Wallace did answer a
number of questions involving their state of mind.
In addition, I should point out to the Court that —
QUESTION:
Do you have one?

Excuse me.

Can you illustrate just that?

I don't want to take all your time, but —

7
dkw ?

MR. LUBE'LL;

Yes, yes.

For example, as to the question — as to the questions
of whether there

a conflict in the —• in what he had

obtained from interviews between a colonel and a major who
were in Hawaii early in February —QUESTIONs
MR. LUBELLs

Are you speaking now of Mr. Lando?
Yes, Mr. Lando — in terms of whether

he had interviewed a Colonel Nicholson and a major who had
been in

a Major Crouch — who had been in Hawaii.

And

one of the questions that was involved is, when did Franklin
return from Hawaii to Vietnam.
Questions were asked in his interviews of these
two people without

when Mrs. Franklin had left Hawaii.

I asked Mr. Lando whether he thought there was a conflict or
contradiction between the information he got from these two
interviewees„
He said that ha thought that their statements
regarding Mrs. Franklin’s leaving Hawaii were contradictory.
So he did give us certain answers regarding his
state of mind.
There is no consistency as to which answers he
did

give regarding his state of mind and which he did not.

Perhaps the only consistency is that as the deposition
proceeded, Mr. Lando!s counsel and

counsel for CBS decided

to take a firm position that they would answer no questions

8

regarding his state of mind.
QUESTION:

Hr, Lubail, could you give us perhaps

the most persuasive example you can think of of a question
that you asked and that he refused to answer?
One of the things I have trouble with in this case
is, it's awfully general.
MU. LUBELLs

Yes, yes.

the example that I posed before.

The question, for example —
He had interviewed a number

of soldiers who had given hixn detailed information as to
Colonel Herbert's treatment of the Vietnamese.
of that information on the program.

He puts none

He does not refer to the

fact that there was information that Colonel Herbert

had

shown particular care that war crimes not be committed in
Vietnam.
We asked him questions as to the basis on which
he did not include any reference to those interviews in his
program, and nevertheless included a quote from General
Barnes to Colonel Herbert ~
QUESTIONS

Specifically, you question then — is

this a fair paraphrase? — why did you not include any
reference to such and such an interview?

And he refused to

answer any such questions?
MR. LUBELL:

Tees.

Actually, we didn't say -—- we

said, what was the basis for not including any excerpts from
those interviews?

9

w 9

QUESTION:

tod that question he refused to answer?

MR. LUBELL:

Yes.

In addition, we asked him for his opinions of the
credibility and veracity of persons whose statements he did
include on the program.

We think that was directly relevant

to vrhether he entertained serious doubts as to matters
included on the program.
QUESTIONS
MR. LUBELL:

Those he also refused to answer?
Those he refused to answer too, your

Honor.
Now, when the defendants Lando and Wallace refused
to answer questions in these areas of state of mind, plaintiff
mads a Rule 37 motion, which was brought before Judge Haight,
the district court judge.
Judge Haight considered the Sullivan principles, and
specifically considered the burden of proof of clear and
convincing evidence, which applies in the Sullivan case;
considered the subjective nature of the state of mind that
must be proven? found that the questions which he had —
which Lando in particular and Wallace to some extent, because
there were very few questions open around Mike Wallace that
the questions that they had refused to answer were directly
relevant to the subjective state of mind issue? that the
issue of the subjective state of mind was a core issue in the
case? and that the information as to the defendants4 state

10

w 10

of mind could only be obtained from the defendants by the
vary nature of the subject matter.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, Mr. Lubell, at that stage

was there any controversy whether seme of the matters shown
on the J!S0 Minutes" program was or was not false?
MR. LUBELLs

The defendants take the position that

the matters presented -QUESTION:

No, I'm speaking at that stage of the --

MR. LUBELLs

At that stage, no — the issue -— at

that stage before the district court judge the issue was
whether the questions were privileged in terms of press'
QUESTION:

But the issue of falsity ■—■

MR. LUBELLs
QUESTION:

— is very much in the case, too, isn't it?

MR. LUBELLs
It's very much in

Falsity —

The issue of falsity is in the case.

the case, your Honor.

QUESTION:
MR. LUBELL:

It still is?
Yes, I believe it is.

I don't think the

defendants have conceded that the statements made on the
program were false.
QUESTION:

And was there ever any suggestion that

the issue of falsity should be determined before you got
into the question of malice?
Because unless something was false, I gather you
wouldn't have a case, would you?

MR. LUBELLs

Right.

There was no suggestion.

As a matter of fact the discovery process has
proceeded in uncovering,, trying to uncover, both issues
simultaneously.

And I8m sure your Honors appreciate, both

issues are intertwined.

Because as we learned the facts, we

also learn what it was that CBS ascertained.
So we also learn what CBS — we also learn soma
evidence of CBS8 state of mind as we learn the facts in order
to prove that the program contained serious falsehoods.
QUESTION:

But on the issue of so-called editorial

privilege, or whatever you’re going to call it — privilege —■
1 take it that wouldn’t even be in the case unless

there was

first a finding of falsity of something about this program,
would there?
MR. LUBELL:

I’m not sure whether that is so, because

what the circuit court did is take this entire range of
media activity, which they call the editorial process, and
immunized it from discovery by a plaintiff.
Now, it is possible that in our search for the facts
QUESTION5

Well, immunized it in the 3ense that it

was privileged in some way.
MR. LUBELLs

In the sense of privilege, we could

not obtain what happened during that editorial process.
And I suggest that it is possible that during that
editorial process certain things may have arisen which

12
12

relate to the question of truth and falsity as well.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Lubell, in an ordinary lawsuit in the

discovery stage of the case, you have to do your discovery
for all cf the issues that you think will be necessary to
prove at trial before you ever get to trial, don't you?
MR. LUBELLs

Yes.

Yes, your Honor,

and that is

the way we proceeded in this lawsuit that we have asked
questions of Land© and Wallace anet the other persons we've
deposed directed to the issues of truth and falsity, to the
issue of actual malice; both issues.
tod I don't ~ I might suggest I don't see in this
type of case how it is —
QUESTION?

How you can avoid it.

MR. LUBELLs

— as a practical matter ever able to

be distinguished.
The court of appeals reversed Judge Haight’s —■
QUESTION?

Forgive me; I shouldn't have taken so much

of your time.
But I gather you have allegations —■ I take it, do
you not, on which you rely? — of falsity.
MR. LUBELLs
QUESTION;

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

Now, are they very -- about many, many

matters —
MR. LUBELLs
QUESTIONS

Yes, they are.
— or only a few, or what?

13
13

MR, LUBELLs

We maintain that the program as a whole

as well as many specific matters presented in the program are
false»

And as 1 indicated in my opening comments that the

falsity concerned whether Herbert was a liar? as to the
cover up of war crimes in the 173rd Airborne Brigade? whether
Herbert himself was capable of committing acts

of brutality

against the Vietnamese? whether Herbert had used the war
crimes issue as an excuse for his own relief from command?
and whether Herbert had perpetrated a hoax on the American
people,
QUESTION:
MR. LUBELL:
QUESTION:
MR, LUBELL:

All of which — as you say, falsehood»
All of which —
Are depicted in the "60 Minutes” program?
Yes, yes, we say they are? yes, your

Honor c
I wanted to return for a moment to the question of
the defendants discussing or disclosing parts of their state
of mind.
There is another fact in this case which makes it
unique in another way, and that is, after the program Barry
Lando wrote an article for Atlantic Monthly,

It is the other

cause of action, in this case, which is not before this court.
However, the article itself is a full discussion of
whet was the purported editorial process in producing the
program.

14
14

Not only that, but the article time and time again
speaks of Mr. Landos s state of mind on matters that ha was
looking at while he was preparing the program.
So we have a situation where the press has publicly
gotten a shot at saying what its state of mind was, and now
would prevent a plaintiff from examining the press in a
lawsuit in which a district court judge can regulate whether
there's any abuse of discovery? from examining the press as
to that state of mind which is critical in a Sullivan defamation
action.
QUESTIONs

Are you suggesting that the responses

were forthcoming as to the state of mind when it helped the
defendants® case, but not when conceivably it might harm the
defendants8 case?
MR. LUBELL;
QUESTIONs

Yea, we are suggesting that.
That wouldn't be the first time in a

deposition that that sort of thing had happened, would it?
MR. LUBSLL?

I don't believe so.

Now, the heart of our argument before this Court is
that the Court of Appeals, by creating this editorial
process privilege, has upset the balance struck by this Court
in Sullivan and its progeny.

Because what — and succinctly

what — the Court of Appeals has done is deprive the plaintiff
of the opportunity of ascertaining direct evidence of this
subjective state of mind where the plaintiff has to satisfy

15
15

a clear and convincing burden of proof.
In substance,,

what the Second Circuit has done is

by a rule which, creates that pri\7iiege eliminated substantially
all plaintiff's possibilities of recovery under the Sullivan
principles.
And we submit that it was not the purpose of this
Court in Sullivan and its progeny to preclude public officials
or public figures from recovering for defamatory statements
when those statements were maliciously made.
The Court of Appeals relies in part on this Court's
decision in Bransburg as well the line of cases concerning
confidential source disclosure.
We submit to the court that the decision of the
Court of Appeals is in error when it relies on Branzburg and
the confidential sources disclosure cases.
The decision of this Court in Bransburg has provoked
a great deal of discussion both in lower courts and in learned
journals.

But there is one thing that is undisputed %

Bransburg did .not create an absolute privilege.
The decision of the Court of Appeals, on the other
hand, creates an absolute privilege.
In addition, the plurality ■—

Mr. Lube11, what is the line that the

Court of Appeals — not the line that you draw, but where
do you see the line?

16
w 16

MR. LUBELL?
QUESTION %

That the Court of Appeals drew?
Yes.

You're conducting your questioning

where did they say you went off?
MR. LUBELL;

I think under the Court ©f Appeals

decision? I think they would say any inquiry into what thc^
media or the press did after obtaining the interview? from
that time until the time that the finished product is
broadcast? w® could not inquire into.
We could not find out whether in fact during that
time,, for example —
QUESTIONs

Well? you see it as time and not subject

matter?
MR. LUBELL;

Well? we see it as both a period of —

I think there are two aspects of the Court of Appeals decision
and it is difficult to ascertain which on© is the more
powerful aspect.
We submit both are powerful in terms of upsetting
Sullivan completely.
But one is? you cannot inquire into the subjective
state of mind which -QUESTIONs

Well? Mr'. Hibeli? would you think that any

question that started out? did you know? would be barred by
this ruling?
MR. LUBELL;
QUESTION;

Yes.
Did you know a particular fact?

17
MR» LUBELL:

Yes*- we believe that that would pertain

to the state of mind of the reporter,,
QUESTIONS

So you couldn’t inquire whether a

particular fact was true or not?
MS. LUBELL%

We could inquire as to who he interviewed.

We could not inquire as to whether he knew -QUESTIONs
MR. LUBELL %

You could find out what he was told?

But we could not

But you could ask —Icm sorry.
Couldn’t you ask, did you ever learn that

so-and-so?
MR. LUBELL;

I believe that when Chief Judge *

Kaufman talks about any intrusion into the mental process of
the press, I believe that he speaks of —
QUESTION s

I didn’t

you really read it to mean

that you cannot inquire of the reporter the state of his
knowledge about whether he knew certain facts or not?
MR. LUBELLs

We can inquire as to — I believe we

can inquire as to what he did, but I do not believe we
can —
QUESTION:
What did he tell you?

You interviewed John Jones?
He told me so-and-so.

I did.

Didn’t you know

18
that John Jones had said not that but this to somebody else?
Couldn't you ask that question?
MR» LUBELLs

It is my opinion that Chief Judge

Kaufman’s opinion is not clear as to whether that question
is permissible when he states that any intrusion into the
mental process of the reporter is precluded.
QUESTIONt

You mean you couldn't say, were you ever

told by anybody else to the contrary?
MR. LUBELLs

That you could ask, I believe, your

Honor.
QUESTIONs

Welly couldn't you go on and say did you

ever learn from any other source to the contrary?
MR. LUBELLs

I think your Honor you gat closer to

an inquiry regarding the state of mind — I must say that
I believe Chief Judge Kaufman's decision as it stands now
creates several different interpretations on that issue.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN 17. LUBELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LUBELL:
speak:

In answer to the open question, so to

It's difficult to give a precise answer as to what the

court of appeals decision means in connection with whether
questions of whether the defendants knew of certain things
would be permitted.
QUESTION:

Nell, you don’t have any court opinion

anyway, do you.
QUESTION:
MR. LUBELL:
QUESTION:

No.
I'm sorry?
There's no court opinion from the court

of appeals.
QUESTION:
MR. LUBELL:

Ho majority.
No, no majority opinion.

There's an

opinion by Chief Judge Kaufman who seems to indicate that
perhaps you can ask questions —
QUESTION:

Nov/, which opinion are you talking about

in what you’re about to say?
MR. LUBELL:

Judge Kaufman's or Judge Oakes?

Nell, I think the Chief Judge's opinion

at page 22a of the Appendix describes what plaintiff has

20
/

20

already done in the course of discovery, and states that he
has already discovered what Lando knew, saw, said and wrote
during his investigation„
Then subsequently he states, now, Herbert wishes to
probe further and inquire into Lando's thoughts, opinions and
conclusions.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't that imply that you can ask

anything — ask him whether he knew something?
MR, LUBELL:

Yes, it does.

Yes, it does.

However, when you get into the question of the
editorial process issue, and look not only to the Chief Judge's
opinion but the concurring opinion of Judge Oakes, where he
states at 42a, it is quite another
off:

I'm sorry, it starts

Thus it is one thing to tell the press that its end

product is subject to the actual malice standard, and that a
plaintiff is entitled to prove actual maliceit is quite
another to say that the editorial process, which produced the
end. product in question, is itself discoverable.
Now, if during the editorial process —
QUESTION:

Yes, but if either — if there are

only two people supporting the judgment of the court of appeals,
and either one of them says that something is discoverable,
it's discoverable under that judgment.
MR. LUBELL:

However, if it's discoverable in a

time period that might be described as the editorial process

21

w 21

time period, which both of the opinions say cannot be
inquired into — for example, if we were to ask whether
during the —
QUESTION;

Well, you can ask -- I would think it:

would be a fair implication from what you read a moment ago
that you could say when you went into this process, did you
know it, and when you came out of the process did you know it?
MR. LUBELL;

What — I don’t -- I think we possibly

could ask that»
However, what we could not ask is what it is he
knew or came to know during that process»
QUESTION;

For example —

Well, I know, but if he came out of it

knowing it, he learned it somewhere.
MR. LUBELL:

The problem is we wouldn’t know what

it is he came out with knowing.
QUESTION;
question.

Well, you would ask him a particular

Did you know so-and-so?
MR. LUBELL:

Or did you not know so-and-so?

We would have to ask him every ™

knowing every issue under every aspect of the case.

We

would not be able to -—
QUESTION;
MR. LUBELL;

Well, how else do you prove a lawsuit?
But we would not be able to find out what —

how it is that he came to know something.

For example, what

if during the process Mike Wallace said to Barry Lando, or
somebody else from CBS said to Barry Lando, I ran into this

22

.w 22

parson who was involved in your program who you’ve interviewed
end he tells me something which is contrary to what he told
you .
This is during the editorial process? conversation
within CBS„
QUESTION:

Then you think the -- you think that

under this judgment you could not ask, were you ever told
something to the contrary?
MR. LUBELL:

I think it’s possible that the

defendants could raise the question that if it was told to the
defendant during the editorial process —
QUESTION %

By somebody on the — within the

editorial process.
MR. LU3ELL:
yes, your Honor.

In the course of the editorial process,

I think.

QUESTIONs

But if it were told by some outsider, you

could inquire into that.
MR. LUBELL:

It may well — I can’t — I would argue

obviously if it came up in the district court, I would argue
that you could.
QUESTION :
MR, LUBELL:

Oh, sureyou could.
But I don’t — I cannot say with

confidence that that answer is supported by these two
decisions which form the majority -—
QUESTION:

Well, assuming now, Mr. Lubell, that the

23
23

question suggested by Justice White had been answered, and
that he has had two statements made to him which are not
consistent.
Under this opinion, or these collective opinions,
do you think can then ask, why did you publish this and why
did you omit that?
MR. LUBELL:

No, I do not think, and I will be quite

clear on this, I don't think we could ask that.

What we cannot

ask is what did he think about what he learned, or what he
knew.
For example ■—■ and this is a. concrete example from
this case —
QUESTION:

You can't ask whether he thought it was

true or false?
MR. LUBELL:

That's right.

That’s right.

‘I do not

think we can ask that question.
For example, ha interviewed —
QUESTION:

And you can’t ask xdietner he thought

some witness was truthful or not, or whether he was telling a
falsehood or not?
MR. LUBELL:

We can't — that’s right.

And also we

can’t ask whether
QUESTION:

In other words, you can’t ray, did y:u

believe him?
MR. LUBELL:

Or did you think you had to check it

24
further»
For example,, he interviewed a witness — a soldier
by the name of Bob Stemmies.

Defendant produced notes which

say, have to check with Stemmies further.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, you had no problem about

sources here, did you, in this case?
MR, LUBELL:

No, in fact there was a question of

sources which was then waived by CBS.

There is no source

problem in this case.
I would like to say — I see that the white light
is on.

I want to reserve a little time for rebuttal.
But I did want to just focus on the Branzburg

analysis by the plurality of this Court, plus Justice
Powell8s concurrence in Branzburg as it was further elucidated
by the Justice in footnote 3 in Gertz that the proper approach
to questions of discovery where the First Amendment is
implicated is a case-by-case approach where questions of
specificity, relevance and materiality, importance to the
core issues of the case, are explored by the district judge.
And District Judge Haight in this case did explore
thos issues and did attempt to -- and came to conclusions
giving due care and consideration for the First Amendment
values»
What, he did not do — and apparently what the
court -- what the respondents complain of

he did not establish

25

:w 25

a privilege by which the defendant can refuse to answer
questions involving their subjective state of mind, the
very issue in a Sullivan case*
I will reserve the rest of my time.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Abrams.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS, ESQ,, ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR, ABRAMS;

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please the

Court;
I would like to start, if I may, by outlining
briefly what we considered at the time, and still consider,
the vice of the district court opinion, and then proceed
to the opinion of the court of appeals and some of the
questions which members of this Court have addressed with
Mr. Lubell.
The crux cf the district court opinion, Mr, Lubell
to the contrary, was not that the questions asked went to the
core of the case, and .it was not that the questions asked
provided information which could only be obtained from the;
journalists.

Those are not findings of the district court,

and indeed, as I read the district court opinion, they are
inconsistent with the findings of the district court.
The district court concluded as a matter of law
that the concept of editorial process which we urged upon

26

w 2f6

him stemming from cases of this Court, such as the Miami
Herald case, had nothing to do with the question of the
scope of pre-trial discovery in the Sullivan case.
QUESTION;

How does Miami Herald bear on this case?

MR. ABRAMS;
this;

Our argument, Mr. Chief Justice, is

We think that what the court established in the

Tornillo case was, at its narrowest, of course, that the
right of reply statute was unconstitutional.
But broader than that, we think it established a
First Amendment proposition that at least too close inquiry
into the editorial process of a newspaper, or in this
case a broadcaster, is itself barred, or at least presumptively
barred, under the First Amendment.
If I can give you a hypothetical;

If Florida had

responded to this Court's ruling in the Tornillo case by
passing a new statute requiring that a newspaper which did
not print an answer had to disclose why it didn't print an
answer.
QUESTION;

Yes, but that wasn't involved in the

Miami Herald —
MR.

ABRAMS;

Absolutely not.

Your Honor, I'm not

urging —
QUESTION;
MR. ABRAMS;

We're going beyond
Without question we're going beyond

that case, but what I am saying is that it does seem to us

27
t

27

us that the underlying theory of that case ought not to be
limited to the. right of reply statute any more than you would
limit, I think, Mills v. Alabama to limitations to what occurs
on election day and what can be printed by a newspaper on
election day,,
We think what the Court should do, what it has not
yet dcme —■ and this is the first case since Tornillo in
which this is raised — and what we think the Second Circuit
concluded as well, is that the underlying -- the underlying
basis of Tornillo is not alone that right of reply statutes
are unconstitutional, but that the choice of materials by
editors to go in newspapers or on broadcasts, the treatment
of material to go in, the nature of contents, is at least
presumptively protected, just as I think it would be if, in the
Florida case, the Florida legislature — again, a hypothetical
if the Florida legislature after your ruling had subpoenaed
the editor of the Miami Herald and asked him the very questions
the very questions, asked of Barry Lando in this case? in
effect, why did you print this and not that?

-What was the

nature of your editorial decision-making?
I do not suggest that this is what the Court held
in Tornillo.

Of course it did not.

But we do think that it

is consistent with Tornillo, and that the kind of dedication
to the notion of editorial process protection, which is
embodied in Tornillo itself, outght to be embodied here as

28

well.
I think I can best.illustrate it by reference to
Mr. Lubeil’s answer to Mr. Justice Stevens earlier, in which
he was asked, what8s the best example that you've got, what
is it that you're really losing, what kind of questions
aren't being answered here.
And Mr. Lubell gave an example, which I think is a
fair example, of a situation in which a particular individual
was interviewed on the program, on the page reference, if the
Court wishes to see it later, is at 53a of the Appendix.
And this person, who had served with Colonel Herbert
in the Army, Bruce Potter by name, said on the program that
ha was in a helicopter with Colonel Herbert and that in the
helicopter next to Colonel Herbert, Colonel Herbert had
v

suggested by thrusting a prisoner of war toward the open
door of the helicopter that he might throw him out.

And

that Colonel Herbert had as well thrown sandbags out to
suggest to people on the ground, a prisoner on the ground,
that there were people being thrown out of planes, and that
therefore, they should talk.
That's

what Bruce Potter said.

QUESTIONs

You think that’s an unfair stratagem in

war?
MR. ABRAMS;
defamatory.

Your Honor, I don’t think it’s

It is their position that that is defamatory per se.

29

:w 29

I don°t think that it even states a cause of action to say
that Colonel Herbert is, quote, capable of brutality, unquote.
QUESTIONg

Well, unless the statement were false, and

it was known that it was false.

Then it might be, would it

not?
MR. ABRAMS;

I don't think it would be defamatory

even then in times of war.

MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION;
r‘ MR. ABRAMS;

That's a question of New York lav??
I'm sorry.
That's a question of New York law.
Yes, yes.

That’s a question of New York law, and I think New
York law, to some extent at least, has been constitutionalized
as to what is defamatory.

This Court hasn’t yet ruled on the

scope of First Amendment protection, if any, in terms of a
definition of what is defamatory, but there is a Second
Circuit ruling which so holds —
QUESTION;

Would you agree, Mr. Abrams, that under

New York Times v. Sullivan, malice is a state of mind?
MR. ABRAMS;

Your Honor, I fully agree that in order

to prevail, a plaintiff in a New York Times v. Sullivan case
must either prove that — in this case -— CBS knew what it
was broadcasting was untrue, or broadcasting with reckless
disregard of truth or falsity, meaning with serious doubts
as to — X don't dispute that at all.

30

QUESTIONS

The question :Ls — is the question, then,

in the case is, how the plaintiff finds that out?

Is that not

so?
MR, ABRAMS:

I think the plaintiff finds it out,

your Honor, first of all by the kinds of materials he was
given.

He was — there was an extraordinary amount of

production in this casa.

I don’t want to limit our argument

today just to this case, but X think Judge Kaufman’s opinion
is clearly informed by what it is that the plaintiff had
in this case.
And if I may say so, there’s no suggestion at all
in any opinion of any court in this case that there was a
selective production for the purpose of making CBS look any
better.
And what Judge Kaufman said —
QUESTION:

X gather from that — from what Judge

Kaufman said, that he wasn’t indicating that the plaintiff

extent that one takes as one°s lodestar here a notion of *—
and I appreciate the fact that it is necessarily an amorphous
developing concept of editorial process

what is most

important is, what was on the program and what was off the
program.

in this area are questions such as Mr. Lubell referred to
earlier, which is, why didn’t you put the four people on who
had good things to say about Colonel Herbert?

MR. ABRAMS:

We think that should fall ass well —
Why?

Why?
Because it seems to me that to proba

that deeply into the mind of the journalist is first of all
not necessary in order to allow the plaintiff to prove its
case. ’ It is not the kind of question which has historically
lad, so far as I know, any plaintiff to win a libel case
governed by New York Times against Sullivan.
And I think that -- and this question before you -I think to make the journalist answer the question, not did
you believe what was on the program —■
QUESTION?

Well, how about the question, Mr. Abrams,

not did you believe him? didn’t you know that he had told a
different story to John Smith?
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

How about that?

That question wasn’t asked.
No, I say, what about it?

Is that within

or outside the protected clause?
MR. ABRAMS:

I would think that questions as to what the

journalist knew are protected -- are questions which he ought
toanswer.
QUESTION:

Even though "knew" involves some sort of

cognition.
MR. ABRAMS:

Some sort.

But it seems to me that on

any kind of graded scale, as yon go down that road,

at the

end of it at least is, why didn't yon put these four people
on who said something good about Colonel Herbert?

something to the contrary by somebody?

Mr. Abrams, assume this went to trial.

You couldn't then ask him whether he believed it or not?
MR. ABRAMS:

If an objection were made, Mr. Justice

objected to, it seems to me, could not be testified affirmatively
to by the press.
QUESTION:

I'm talking about at the trial.

QUESTIONS

Well, but that * s the ultimate issue in the

case in New York Times v- Sullivan, what Justice Marshall said,
isn’t it?
One of the ultimate facts the jury has to determine
is whether he did it with reckless disregard of the truth,
MR, ABRAMSs

That’s right, and what I said is that we

have not ~ Mr. Lubell has not asked these questions -- but
we would not have objected,

and we do not maintain that the

privilege we seek here protects against a response to the
question about whether anything that was on the program was
believed by the journalist or was known by the journalist
to be untrue.
That, it seems to me, if nothing else,

is waived

by the very fact of putting it on the program.
What we are concerned with here are questions as to
the selective process of inclusion and exclusion, and
particularly, the material that was excluded from the program,
QUESTION s

I thought a moment ago you said a

question about belief in the truth of something could not be
asked.
MR. ABRAMSi

What I excluded from..that, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, v?as a question as to the belief of material which
was actually broadcast on the program.

And what I said is

that which is broadcast on the program, or printed in a
newspaper, it seems to us is material which the journalists

39

39

ought to he prepared to respond to*
Where we start to differ is that material that
was either not broadcast on the program or beliefs, conclusions
about witnesses in general -- not about particular material —
QUESTIONs

Well, what

tfnat amounts to is the soft

pitches you can hit, and the hard ones you can duck.
MR. ABRAMS:

Your Honor, there are no — I ask

you to look at. the questions here.

There’s not a question

I couldn't answer.
QUESTION:

I know.

But in -- but the kind of

questions that you say are not answerable, the ones that go
further back in the process.

Certainly no producer is going

to say, I didn't believe what I put on the program.
But if you go further back in the process, what did you
think after you learned that X had said such and such, you may
get a string of answers that may permit a jury to infer that he
didn't believe it.
MR. ABRAMS:

\
Well, it seems to ms, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, that it would be a very rare libel case indeed
that the kind of answers you would get to the kind of
questions that you raise, or the kind of questions asked here —
did you consider doing something that you didn't do? — these
are not difficult questions? at least in my experience.
I think in the St. Amant case, this court indicated
by way of illustration, I think, but indicated the kinds of

40
f

40

way© to prove reckless disregard.

And the kind of examples

that the Court gave there were where the story is fabricated,
where the story is a product of the reporter's imagination,
where the story is based on an unverified, anonymous
telephone call, where the publisher's allegations is so
inherently improbable that only a reckless man would have
put them in circulation, where there are obvious reasons to
doubt the veracity of the informant and the accuracy of his
reports,
We are providing all the objective information
from which those kinds of things, and more, can be determined,
QUESTION:

Now you've emphasized — you've emphasized

objectives on a number of your responses.
At least three places I observe in the Sullivan
case the Court refers to malice as a state of mind.

And I

gathered earlier you did not -- you have no quarrel with
that, that malice is a state of mind,
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTIONs

That's correct.
How do you probe for the presence or

absence of malice if you can't, ask what was the state of mind
at the time this or that was done?
MR. ABRAMS?

It seems to me, your Honor, that the way

it has been done in libel cases, and the way it is routinely
done in criminal cases, and security act cases, and anti-trust
cases, is for a jury to infer a particular state cf mind from

41
kw '41

a particular set of facts.
QUESTION:

V»fe 11, now let’s take a criminal case,

for an example, and the defense is self defense.

You wouldn’t

suggest, would you, that you can’t ask the prosecutor —
once tha defendant has taken the stand asserting self defense —
that he can't cross-examine without limit on his state of
mind which is -MR. ABRAMSs

I think once the defendant 'takes the

stand in that type situation, and to the extent that that’s
a relevant issue, he certainly can.
But the fact —
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t the state of mind be relevant

to self defense?
MR. ABRAMS;

Yes, sir, it would.

What I’m saying

is that in a more standard — another criminal example —
would be where the defendant doesn’t take the stand —•
QUESTION:

Well, of course, you can’t probe his

state of mind if he isn’t there.
MR. ABRAMS:

But the question before you is:

we entitled not to respond to certain questions?

Are

And I

think that that is the analogy to the defendant who as
respects to — does not make a self defense argument, but
simply puts the prosecution to its proof.

And in that type of

situation •—

>w 42

can you?

You must take the stand.
MR. ABRAMS:

stand.

Unless you are — you must take the

But unless you are privileged not to respond to

certain questions, and that indeed is the question before
you.
QUESTION §

Well, do you suggest the privilege of a

reporter is different from the privilege of some other
witness?
MR. ABRAMS:

Well, it seems to me, your Honor, that —

this will take a moment or two, because it seems to me that the
Court is yet to rule on whether the Gerfcz case, first of all,
applies alone to the press or the media, or to other entities.
And so that would be a threshold ruling for the Court to make
as to whether there is any different treatment under libel
lav;, or under slander law.

If the treatment is the same, it seems'to me, your
Honor, that there are special reasons why reporters need this
protection.

I do not take the position that individual speakers
cannot get the protection.

I don’t think that’s before you.

But it does seem to me that in fact the only people that
engage in the kind of process we're talking about here tend
to be jounralists.
I suppose I could conceive a situation where that
were not true.

But certainly on a regular basis —

43
w 4-'3

QUESTION:

But

there

are many libel eases brought

against people who have nothing to do with journalism, aresn't
there?
MR. ABRAMS?

There are many libel oases, and your

Honor, it is our position that the only open question is
whether this protection ought to go to the quote, press,
unquote, including a lot more than journalists, or to the
press and speakers as well.
QUESTION

%

Well, narrow it down

let’s narrow

it down to two different kinds of defendants in libel cases:
one is a media reporter and one is just another taxpayer who
happened to —
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:
someone.

Write a book?
No, just make some bad statements about

Not a writer.
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Oh, I'm sorry.
Just another citizen who ia not -- doesn't

purport to b© a professional writer.
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Right.
Do you think there is a difference in the

scope of probing the mind of the one from the other?
MR. ABRAMS:

I'm saying the first thing X would have

to know, your Honor, is whether New York Times against Sullivan
protects the individual in that type situation.

And what I

was observing is that I don't think this Court has yet ruled

44
on the question of whether the Sullivan case does afford that
protection.
If it does* it seems to me that there are particular
reasons why the press needs this protection, because of the
nature of the process it is engaged in, the regularity of it
and the like? but that I certainly wouldn't oppose it for
anyone else.
It seems to me that you often get cases before you
which have peculiar applicability to one or another body
of life in fch® country.

The xcrn.illo case is one.

It may

not suggest a press case, but it is unlikely to arise in the
context of a statute requiring individuals to speak in reply
to things that other people have said.
And I think that that's the same proposition here.
You need not say, and we don't urge you to say, that the
First Amendment protection that w© think exists here, and
should exist here, is limited to the press.

But in all

candor, I have to tell you, 1 don't know that it will often
arise in situations which don't involve the press or writers
or people who engage in the kind of process which CBS Mews,
in this case, has in fact engaged in.
QUESTION s
court of course

Do you know of any cases — none in this

- but any cases in any court which has

put a limit on the cross-examination of the witness when the
issue is malice, whether it's a murder case or whatever kind

of case it may be?
MR. ABRAMSs

Well# the only type situations that

I mean, X8m trying to think of cases where malice is in fact
at issue.

Our case here is the first libel case on one side

or another which relates to this question.
In

sofar as criminal cases are involved, they wouldn't

really involve malice.

Well, a 10(b) — I was limiting my

answer to a question of malice.
QUESTION %
MR. ABRAMSt

But in terms of intent —

Well, state of mind.
State of mind or intent is routinely

proved in 10(b)(5) cases by reference to what the person did,
and what the parson knew.
QUESTIONi

But you wouldn't suggest that there

shouldn't be cross-examination about his state of mind?
MR. ABRAMS:

No, I would not suggest that.

And

I have r© reason to think —
QUESTION §

Mr. Abrams — while X3ve got you

interrupted — I take it that your submission here is not
just that the state — that there should be no inquiry into

46

*w ^6

state of mind, but there shouldn’t be any inquiry into the
editorial process,, the decision-making process.

And for,

example, you would say it would be an improper question to
say, what did another one of your editors tell you?
MR, ABRAMSs
QUESTIONS
editors?

I think as a general matter, certainly,
Or what did you tell one of your senior

Any conversations in that process,

It8s sort of

similar to sort of an executive privilege claim,
MR, ABRAMS:

Yes, it is indeed one of the analogies

that we urge on you in our brief is that of executive privilege,
is that indeed, as the court observed in the Nixon case, that
human essperience teaches us that people will speak less
freely in that type of situation if they know that what they're
going to saiy is going to be exposed to public dissemination.
And there are similar rulings with respect to far
lower level people in the executive branch, the mental processes
of which are at least generally barred from disclosure.
Similar rulings under the speech and debate clause.
QUESTION %

Well, soraetims what happens with the

government when they claim the privilege is what the government’s
interest — if they want to claim the privilege, they must
give the interest.
In a criminal case, for example —
MR.

ABRAMS:

QUESTION:

In a criminal case, that is correct.

— if they claim -- they want to claim

4?
a privilege, they may have to dismiss the prosecution.
And if the government wants to pursue someone
civilly and still claim a privilege for some information that
they have, they may not be able to press their claim.
MR. ABRAMSs

I appreciate that.

I think that would

be a high price to put on this privilege if you should sustain
the privilege.
QUESTION:

It's trtie in civil cases, is it not,

in federal tort claims cases against the government, one of the
classic cases in this court.

The government said it could

not respond about all the gadgetry and things that were in the
experimental plane, because this would give away national
secrets.

And so the courts said, if you can't respond, then

the court will presume the worst and enter judgment against
the government.
MR. ABRAMS;

Our position here, Mr. Chief Justice,

is not that we cannot respond, but that you ought to rule that
we need not respond, and. —
QUESTION:

Well, of course, theoretically, the

United States could have told the court in Philadelphia in
that case that no we will not respond because this is a
national security matter, which is about what it did.

Then

the court said, if you don't respond, we'll enter judgment
against you.

We'll presume the worst.

MR. ABRAMS:

That's the effect of it.

If that were the nature of any privilege

48
granted by the Court in this area, it would not be very
expansive.
QUESTIOMs

Mr. Abrams, let's get way away from this

case.
The reporter has a transcript of a trial in
California.

And h© selects out of it portions to read on his

television show.
Could you ask him about what discussions he had with
people about which one of those portions he should read?
MR. ABRAMS:

You can certainly have the whole

transcript at the outset, in order to make judgments based
on that.
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Well, and he picks and chooses.
Yes, and if the process —
And he does that with discussion with

other people in his office.
MR. ABRAMS:

It seems to me, Mr. Justice Marshall,

that those kinds of discussions in the office, as opposed
to the facts of what he had, what he knew, and what he did,
should indeed be protected.

And it seems to me that the

precise analogy to that is, in fact, executive privilege
cases and the variety of other cases about the nature of
discussions in situations like that.
At the very least, it is our view, that they should
presumptively be protested, and that if they're to be

49
overcome, they should he overcome in very rare circumstances.
One of the worst problems with this case is that the
effect of it is —
QUESTIONs

Well, where do you get the chilling there?

Who gets chilled?
MR. ABRAMSs
QUESTIONS
MR. ABRAMS:

Well, it seams to m@ that what is —*
Who gets chilled?
What is chilled are the people who

speak to each other in the newsroom, aware —
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMSs

They get chilled?

Reporters get chilled?

Oh, Mr. Justice Marshall, I am not

suggesting that this has happened.
On the other hand, I know of no case in which
discovery has gone on for 26 days and 2900 pages in a libel
case.
If this case is lost, Mr. Justice Marshall, or if
I may say so, if there is no protection at all here, I think
it’s fair to predict that questions like this will, for the
first time, become routine, that public officials and
public figures, the vary people set out by this court in
Sullivan as being, for a variety of societal reasons,
people who will receive less protection against defamatory
falsehoods than other people, will be able to commence
libel actions and immediately plunge into thecore questions
at issue here:

Why did you write these bad things about me?

Why didn't you put on some good things about me?
QUESTIONj

This never happened under the old libel

law.
MR. ABRAMSg

It never did.

I don't want to follow

that up* but it never did.
QUESTION:
time.

Well* before 1965, it happened all the

Before New York Times v. Sullivan.
•*

MR. ABRAMS:

Not state of mind inquiry.

At that

point it was wholly truth or falsity — was it privileged —QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:

How about under punitive damages?
For punitive damages it sometimes came

up in very specific and narrow circumstances.

Not questions

as to why certain material was included and excluded.

Punitive

damage questions were historically the questions about,
what did you think of him?
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:

What was your ~

Was there actual malice?
Yes.

Actual malice in a nomconstitutional

sense.
QUESTION:
on editorial process.

Mr. Abrams, what of Mr. Lubell's comment
All of that's been revealed in Mr. Lando's

article in the Atlantic Monthly.
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:
the article.

Well* first —
As it applies to this case.
-» I don’t think it's so.

I have read

51
<xw 52

QUESTION?

I haven't seen it.

Is it in the record

here?
MR. ABRAMS;

Yes, sir.

There's been no finding by

any lower court that that is the case.

If there is a waiver

problem here at all, either by virtue of the Atlantic Monthly
article, or by virtue of any answers which were inadvertently
given in the course of the 26 days over which this was spread,
it seems to me that that’s something for the district court to
deal with.
We are not taking the position that there is no such
thing as waiver,
QUESTIONs

Let me ask you just one more question

about your reference to discussions within the publisher’s
® s t ablishment.
I was just focussing cm the language of the opinion
in Naw ^ork Times against Sullivan, and let me read it to you:
Finally, there is evidence that the Times published
without checking its accuracy against the news stories in the
Times’ own files.

Remember that was an ad? not a news story.

The mere presence of the stories in the files does not, of
course, establish that the Tirneis knew — and the Court put
that wc-rd in quotation ■— knew that the advertisement was
false, since the state of mind required for actual malice
would have to foe brought home to the persons in the Times’
organisation having responsibility for the publication,

52
54]

Now how would you get at that if you couldn't ask
these people what was in their minds at the time?
MR, ABRAMS;

You would ask the person in charge of

advertising acceptability at the New York Times what did you
know?

Did you look at the files?
QUESTION:

What was in the files?

How about the editor, to ask him what

was in the filas?
MR, ABRAMSs

Well, let me say first, your Honor,
£

that the files here have been turned over.

So insofar as the

files as such are concerned, and they objectively reflect what
is at issue, that can be obtained.
What cannot be obtained, directly by way of questions,
in our view — and I think in view of both Judge Kaufman and
Judge Gakss —* are the individualistic tentative probing
conclusions, musings, whatever, of journalists as they go
about their job.
But all the objective questions as to what was there,
what happened, what happened next, what didn8t they look at,
what did they look at, that’s what was lacking in New York
Times against Sullivan.

But for the plaintiffs to have—

QUESTION 2

Or any conversations —

QUESTIONj

— in the editorial process.

MR. ABRAMSt
QUESTION;

Are what?

I’m sorry.

Or any conversations in the editorial

process may not be inquired into.

53
54]

MR» ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

It seems to us that conversations ~~
That's a considerably different kettle

of fish than just talking about state of mind.
MR, ABRAMS:
your Honor, it. is.

Well, that — it is a different area,

And it seems to us that that also should

be privileged, but that the policy basing for some of these
are somewhat different as I tried to set forth.
QUESTION:

But they are.

I get a hint from some of the things —

just between the lines of your argument, Mr. Abrams —• that
perhaps some misreading of the opinions has taken place.
Is that a reasonable conjecture on my part?
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

Misreading of the opinions by —
By the Second Circuit.

That some people

may be misreading them.
MR. ABRAMS:

I think that to the extent — yes, yes.

I think that that is true.

That it is certainly misread if

it is read as an end to libel law, and it is misread if it is
read as a total, absolute privilege in every case which
could conceivably be characterized as, quote, editorial
process, end quote,
I don't think that's what it says, and I don't
think that's what either Judge Kaufman or Judge Oakes have to
say.
QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, before you sit down, when

you started, you called my attention to page 53a of the

Appendix
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTIONS
MR. ABRAMS:

Yes.
Why did you do that?
I started to respond to a question that

you had asked Mr. Lubell.
QUESTION:
MR. ABRAMS:

I’d be interested in your response.
Starting about halfway down on page 53a

there was an interview on the program with Bruce Potter, and
that was, I think»- what Mr. Lubell was, averting to earlier.
And I described it briefly about how Mr. Potter

said that in

his presence Colonel Herbert had thrown a sandbag out and
as well had made threatening gestures toward a prisoner of
war.
Mr. Lubell’s example was that example, and what he
said to you i<?as that there ware four people on the other
side.
What I wanted to say in response to that was, first
as a matter of fact, the four people were not on the helicopter
and had nothing to say as such about what happened there.
But what they did say were good things about Colonel
Herbert, in terms of his desire to care for, to be compassionate
towards, prisoners of war.

And they were not on the program,

although what was on the program was a statement of Mr,
Wallace, saying in so many words, that there are people who
they had interviewed — who CBS had interviewed — who took

55
dkw 56

the position that Colonel Herbert was not capable of brutality.
The point that X was going to make was only this:
It seems to be that that is a very, very dangerous line for
libel law to gc down, either substantively or procedurally,
as we*re talking about procedure today, and allowing questions
about that.
Because the nature of those questions is nothing less
than, why didn't you put the good material on?
QUESTION;

Well, do you think that the question

would be proper if it were asked this way:

In the light of

what these other four persons had to say, did you have any
doubt about the credibility of Mr. Potter?
MR. ABRAMS:

We certainly wouldn’t have objected to

a question asking whether he had any doubt about the
credibility of what Mr. Potter had to say on the progrem.
QUESTION;

No, in —

MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION;

I'm sorry.
— your opinion, was Mr. Potter telling

the truth.
MR. ABRAMS:
QUESTION:

In what he said on the program?

We *—

Well, supposing this wasn't on the program

but it was just one that was slightly different — you'd say
that could not be inquired into.
MR. ABRAMS s
further step away.

Then it seems to me that that is a

It seems to

me that journalists ought to

56
be responsible for what they put. on
QUESTION s

Why does one involve editorial process

any more than the other?
MR. ABRAMS:

Because it seams to me that when you

put it — I think they both involve,, conceptually, the

editorial process.

But when the process is broadcast, it's

out.
QUESTION?

The process wasn't broadcast.

The

product of the process.
MR. ABRAMS:

When the segment at page 53 and 54a is

on the' program, it seems to me, even though that is a result
of the process, the journalist has to respond to the question
as to whether he believes it or not.
QUESTION:

It's permissible to ask why he put:

Potter's statement on, but it is not permissible to ask, why
did you not put the other four statements on?
MR. ABRAMS:

No, your Honor.

It is our position that

it is permissible to ask, did you believe the statement of
Mr. Potter which you broadcast?

And it is our position that

the questions ought not to be allowed to the effect of. why
did you pat it on
QUESTION:

But if there were a second statement

Mr. Potter •— I just want to be sure I —■
MR. ABRAMS s

QUESTION:

Yes.

A second statement by Mr. Potter was

by

57
w S8

somewhat similar, but was not put on the air, it would not
ba permissible to say, did you believe that statement by
Mr, Potter?
MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, your Honor, that is our position

that that should not be permissible,
We think that the product broadcast ought to be what
is at issue, and that that can be inquired into, but not the
process by which other things did not get put on.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We have a few minutes

left.
Mr. Luba11.
REBUTTAL OF JONATHAN W. LUBELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LUBELL:

Very briefly, in regard to references

to the Sullivan decision itself, the reference to the looking
at the files:
The issue that gets raised now by the Second Circuit
decision is, suppose an editor, at the time that the work
product was being worked up, the editorial process was going
on, went to the files and looked at the files during that
editorial process.
The question is;

Cou*d we ask a question about what

was done during the editorial process?

1 think that question

is a serious question in light of the decision of the

58
59

Second Circuit which appears to say that we can8t inquire
as to what was don® during that process.
In addition, in the Sullivan case itself, in
reference to whether the media are the only groups of people
that are protected under the Sullivan principles, I’m sure,
needless to say, the Court is aware that individuals were
aa well petitioners before this court in Sullivan, the
ministers themselves, and they were afforded the protection
of the Sullivan principles, as well as the New York Times.
So I think from Sullivan on, there has been at
least s.n implied recognition that the Sullivan principles
protect anyone who exercises his First Amendment right, first
in regard to public officials, end subsequently in the
decisions of this Court, in regard to public figures.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Lubell, let me ask you just one

question.
At the end of Judge Oakes5 opinion — his last
sentence — he concurs in the general answer of Chief Judge
Kaufman to the certified question.

Was there a single

question certified to the Court?
That1's on page 46a of the —MR. LUBELLs
QUESTIONS

Yes, yes.
There was a single question?

Where is

it in the papers that have been filed?
MR. LUBELL;

I beliesve what he is referring to,

59
60

your Honor,, is the certification memorandum opinion and order.
Because -- as to whether you can specify and focus upon a
specific certified question,. X don’t find it.
QUESTION;

The only certificate of the district judge

would be under 1292(b) saying an interlocutory appeal is
ordered.
Is that what he8s talking about?
MR. LUBELLs

X believe so, and that is in the

Appendix to the petition, th® second memorandum opinion and
order of Judge Haight, beginning at 90a, to the petition in
which he certifies under 1292(b).
QUESTION:

X see.

QUESTIONs

Well, at the very beginning of the court

of appeals opinion it says, appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
1292{b).
MR. LUBELL:

Yes, yes.

Yes, your Honor.

It came

up on a certified — on a certification procedure.

And the

certified question involved the same question that Judea
Haight said was a question of first impression, which had to do
with the state of mind, or whether there was a privilege for
the editorial process of the press.
Further, in regard to the question that the Chief
Justice posed to Mr. Abrams as to criminal cases where
defendant does take the stand, or any civil case where
defendant does take the stand, and the issue of state of mind

60
cw '61

is an issue, whether it would be because of malice

or intent

required, obviously, the defendant must answer those questions
unless a testimonial privilege against self incrimination or
one of the recognised testimonial privileges is asserted.
In this ease, in fact, the defendant, in a pre-trial
sense, took the stand.

He submitted himself to a deposition,

And questions were asked of him about his state of mind
within concrete factual contexts, only because, by the
decisions of this Court, the subjective state of mind has
become the critical Sullivan issue.
In regard to the — again, back to the question of
what questions appeared to be allowable, or would not appear
to be allowable

I would not that the defendants haves

objected at the deposition stage, and have contended throughout
the appeals here, that questions as to the defendants6 view
of the credibility and veracity of persons who appeared on the
program, as well as persons who did not appear on the program,
were not proper.
So that it's not limited to somebody who did not
appear on the program.
I see both my lights are on.
And in conclusion, w® contend that by precluding a
plaintiff from obtaining any direct evidence of state of
mind in a Sullivan case, or obtaining any evidence of what
happened in the editorial process — whichever way you

61
interpret the two aspects of the court of appeals decision completely unbalances the accommodation struck by thl3 court
in Sullivan and its progeny.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:50 p.m., the case was submitted.]
