MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Parker v. Randolph.
Mr0 Terry, I think you may proceed now whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. TERRY , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TERRY:

Mrc Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The case which I have the privilege of presenting to
this Court began in Memphis, Tennessee, in 19700

As the

Sixth Circuit opinion states, this matter involves a sequence
of events which have the flavor of the old west before -the
lav; crossed the Pecos.

The difference is that here, as the

Sixth Circuit stated9 there are no real heroes and there was
a trial.
It seems that in July of 1970, a Las Vegas gambler
by the name of William Douglas came to Memphis with a gun, an
alias and a device for marking cards.

Douglas sought through

some local connections in Memphis a card game0

He was intro­

duced eventually to a Memphis gambler by the name of Robert
Wood.

Wood apparently felt that through his skill at poker

he would be able to relieve Douglas of his money.

However,

Douglas opted for the advantages of marking the cards, rather
than the uncertainties of skill and in three head-to-head

matches he relieved Woods Robert Wood, of approximately $5,000.
Now, Wood apparently had some confidence in him­
self and in his game because he didn’t blame the losses on
his own incompetence and began to suspect that he was being
cheated8

He became convinced that he was being cheated and,

together with his brother, Joe Wood, they formed a plan to
recoup his losses0

That plan involved using Joe Wood and the

three respondents in this matter to rob a fourth poker game
between Mr» Douglas and Robert Wood.

Thus, Robert Wood’s

plan in a nutshell was to recoup his gambling losses by the
robbery proceeds.
Prior to the night of the fourth game, Mr. Joe Wood,
his brother, and two of the respondents here, Hamilton and
Pickens, went to the scene of the fourth game, looked it over,
planned theli? strategy and, according to the evidence, there
was some discussion on how the proceeds would be split8
On that night of the game, there were four people
in the room when the game began, Robert Wood, Joe Wood, Mr.
Douglas, and an individual by the name of Tommy Thomas, who
is said to be a mutual acquaintance of Douglas and Robert
Wood»
At about 9:00 o’clock that evening, Joe Wood began
to unfold the robbery plan.

He got up and said he was going

to the store to buy some beer.
with the three respondents.

He went outside and he met

They did go to the store»

They

5
did buy some beer, but apparently they stationed their cars
some place suitable to their plan and they approached the
apartment together.

Mr® Douglas became suspicious®

He heard

noise outside and he armed himself with a shotgun.
Now, Joe Wood removed the three respondents from
right outside the door of the apartment before Douglas could
see them and he was allowed to crawl back into the apartment
while being watched with Douglas who was armed with a shotgun®
Once Joe Wood was back inside, the game continued®

The three

respondents were outside.
Joe Wood then a short time later, telling the people
inside that he had to use the bathroom, entered the bathroom
of the apartment and came out armed with a gun®

He

apparently was a little nervous at that time because he gave
the gun to his brother Robert Wood who was seated at the
table playing cards with Douglas, and Joe Wood left, leaving
the door to the apartment open®
Tommy Thomas at that time was

lying on the floor.

He got up, closed the door and attempted to mediate between
Douglas and Robert Wood®

As the evidence shows, Douglas

apparently reached for a gun that was in his belt at that
time and Robert Wood killed him.
QUESTION;

Where was this, in a private residence

or =>MR® TERRY;

This was in an apartment house in

6
Memphis»

It was In
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:

In an apartment?
Yes, sir.

Within seconds from the shots

that eventually killed Mr. Douglas, the door flew open and
the three respondents eame running in to carry out their plan
of robbery*

They fired some shots within the apartment,

robbed Thomas of some $50 to $80, took the proceeds off the
!

table, took a knife and then five eventual defendants in this
case, the two Wood brothers and three respondents here,
Hamilton, Pickens and Randolph, left*
They went from there, according to the evidence,
st

over to Hamilton's apartment where they hid the weapons,
divided up the money and went thdg|r separate ways.

Douglas,

of courses, died.
Subsequently, they v;ere all either arrested or they
turned themselves in to the Memphis Police Department*

Prior

to their trial, four ©f these individuals gave statements to
the, Memphis Police Department.

Joe Wood never gave a state­

ment, and he did not testify at the trial*
\

Robert Wood gave

a detailed lengthy statement that was later Introduced at
trial In a redacted form*
trial*

Mr. Hamilton ~
QUESTION:

daction?

Robert Wood also testified at the

What Is the state's position on the re­

Somewhere in the briefs I had the impression that

the state conceded the redaction was not effective.

Do you

7
agree to that?
MR0 TERRY:

Mr, Justice, I think that the redaction

process was admirable.
effective.

I do not concede that it wasn’t

What I mean by that is I don't think that redac­

tion when there are two defendants sitting there and the
references are two others is ever a substitution for crossexamination or confrontation,,

But I do think it is a factor

to be considered when you get to the issue of the devastating
effect of the co-defendant’s statement.

In other words, I

think it is better in this case that there \*as an attempt at
redaction.

For instance, in some of the cases here where

this Court has found harmless error, like Schneble and Brown,
there was no redaction.
QUESTION:

So it isn’t a question of erroneous re­

daction where some word that should have gone out was left
in?
MR. TERRY:

No, sir„

I perceive the redaction as a

factor to be considered in reaching the final question,.
QUESTION:

Now in this trial there were how many co­

defendants?
MR„ TERRY:
QUESTION:
MRo TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR„. TERRY:

There were five, sir0
Five co-defendants.
That’s right.
And the charges were murder and robbery?
They were charged under the felony

8
murder statute, murder in perpetration of a robbery®
QUESTION:.

All charged with murder and some of them

also, if not all of them, charged with robbery as well?
MR. TERRY:

They were charged — I don’t believe

they were charged with armed robbery.
QUESTION:

It is not a matter of belief, it is what

happened„
MR. TERRY:

It is my understanding of the record

that they were charged with murder in the perpetration of a
robbery and were convicted of that offense.
QUESTION:
MR® TERRY:

The five co-defendants in one trial?
Yes, Your Honor®

Now, Hamilton gave two confessions, one oral which
was immediately reduced to writing and admitted in a redacted
form®

He went through a question and answer routine with the

police department, that was transcribed but not admitted.
Randolph gave two oral statements wh|ich were later admitted,
both redacted and admitted.

Pickens went through the same

question and answer routine with the police department, the
questions and the answers were transcribed, there was redac­
tion performed and they were admitted.

In Pikens* case, he

signed the transcription and initialled each page also.

The

redaction process reduced any references to the other de­
fendants, either eliminated them, deleted them or changed
them to ’’they” references, two ’’other party” references, "we”

9
of "guy.”

The ’’guy” reference is the only indication of the

sex of the people who were involved»

There is no indication

of any other physical characteristics, no indication of race»
Now, it is the position of the State of Tennessee
here that the question before this Court is a Sixth Amendment
question involving the right to confrontation»

We maintain

that the error in this matter below stems from an inappropri­
ate application of Bruton to the facts in this case»

We be­

lieve it Is impossible to draw a logical analogy between
these facts and the facts in the Bruton case.
To do that, to draw that ana,logy ignores some very
real distinctions in this case and also ignores the decisions
of this Court in Schneble, Harrington and more recently in
Bro\«u

We think the most important distinction between this

case and Bruton is that in this case the parties raising the
Bruton objection had confessed themselves, that their con­
fessions are internally consistent, that they corroboi’ate
\

1

each other, and that they have been redacted.
We think that these factors have an impact, have an
effect on the question of devastation, the question that
concerned this Court very much in Bruton»

We think that the

risk of prejudice to these people is eliminated because of
the internal consistency, because of the redaction»

We think

that the overall effect of the confession is simply cumulative.
1 think another important distinction between this

10

case and Bruton Is the testimony of Robert Wood and the
testimony of Tommy Thojns^s, ,
QUESTION:

...............

Mr. Terry, are you basically making

harmless error argument?
MR. TERRY:

Mr» Justice, I think that it is fair to

say that, but I think that -QUESTION:

The reason I am asking, supposing one of

these confessions had been very, very brief and really didn’t
— wasn't enough to constitute proof beyond a reasonable
doubt, was just some kind of inculpatory statement that tended
to hurt him in the trial, would he be disabled from making a
Bruton objection if you didn't have enough — if there were
not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, apart from the other
confessions?

In other words, are you arguing as a matter of
t

law that whenever you confess you don’t have the Bruton ob­
jection, or are you arguing in this case that it is harmless
error?
MR. TERRY:

The problem I have with that, Mr»

Justice Stevens, is starting with Bruton as a starting point,
when you have more than one confession or when the objector
)
is also a confessor» I think at that point you should go
back to the Sixth Amendment and the question should be con­
frontation, and what does confrontation require and whether
the remedy has to be what occurred in Bruton»

In Bruton I

think9 under the facts in Bruton, George Bruton was convicted

11
on hearsay»

There was very little else there»

Here that is

a different situation and that is why I don’t like to say
harmless error,, because harmless error assumes a Bruton
violation and I don’t think there was a Bruton violation
here»

If there is a violation., it is a Sixth Amendment

violation.
QUESTION:

Well,, is it because each defendant con­

fessed or because the confession of each defendant was very,,
very probative against him?
MR. TERRY:

I think the most important distinction

Is that they confessed9 they incriminated themselves.
QUESTION:

You x^ould make the same argument even if

you didn't have a confession from Robert Wood and If you
didn’t have a lot of detail In each confession — say5 for
example that Pickens had a very short confession in which he

I

just said, !!Wells I met with these people but ,therr I went
home,” and he didn't really say very much., and that is all he
confessed to* - Would he -‘be- disqualified from raising a
Bruton objection?

And you don’t have a Wood confession In

there and basically your proof consists of what is In the
Randolph confession and the Pickens confession.
MR» TERRY:

No* I think Mr» Pickens would be in a

much better situation because
QUESTION:

Well, as a matter of laws would he be

able to make a Bruton objection?

He would have made a

12
confessione
MR. TERRY:
argue with you

Again — and I don’t want to appear to

I think he should make a Sixth Amendment

objection, a right to confrontation objection —
QUESTION:
MRo TERRY:

Yes.
— no cross-examination, "I'm being

convicted on hearsay," he would be saying -QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:

Yesa
— not Bruton.

It is just not Bruton

because Bruton has one confession and the person raising it
is
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:

But he is being convicted on hearsay»
-- is sitting there silently, not

testifying and not confessing and I think that you have a dif­
ferent situation when you have corroborative confessions —
QUESTION:

You see, what I am trying to find out is

whether you are making a legal argument or a factual argument»
You make a very strong factual argument in your brief that the
}

evidence is overwhelming against each of these people, but is
that because of this particular record or because as a matter
of law none of them has the right to make this —
MR. TERRY:

I think it is because of this particular

record and I think that under harmless error — I am saying
harmless error under the Sixth Amendment, not harmless error
under Bruton, and that I know is confusing but 1 am not the

13
only one confused.

If you read the circuits in this situations

they are very much split and they go through a proeess of
trying to figure out exactly what they are saying, and some
of them In the end say it doesn’t make any difference what we
are saying.

But I think the important thing is to go back to

the right to confrontation and not stop at Bruton, go all the
way back and

say what does confrontation require8

If con­

frontation requires cross-examination, and there is no crossexamination, then what is the remedy.
In Bruton’s situation, he is convicted on hearsay„
In this situation they are not.
to be reversal.

So the remedy does not have

The remedy here can be affirmanceEven if

you say that there is a technical violation of a right to
cross-examine

that is secured by the Sixth Amendment, there

still does not have to be the drastic remedy that was neces­
sary for —
QUESTION?

Mr. Terry, tell me, Mr. Pickens, the

holding below is that his confession was improperly admitted
against him, isn’t it?
MR®, TERRY;
QUESTION;

Because of Miranda.
So there is no interlocking confession

issue as to him under Brutons, is there here, as the ease
comes here?
MRo TERRY;

I would be less than candid to tell you

that we are in as good a position with Pickens as we are with

14
Randolph and Hamilton.
QUESTION:

If it was improperly admitted, then

there is obviously no interlocking confession Issue at all as
to him9 is there, and Bruton was violated as to him.

You

have just suggested that in his situation he may have been
the victim of a conviction on hearsay evidence.
MR, TERRY:
QUESTION:

That's correct, except —
As least as to Pickens, isn't he entitled

to an affirmance here?
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:

Pickens was Identified by Robert Wood.
I know, but you said yourself, as I

understand it, three confessions were introduced — four.
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION;

Because Robert Wood's was in, too.
And it has been held now that Pickens'

was improperly introduced.
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Then If his conviction rests on the three

confessions that were Introduced, why isn't that a Bruton
situation?
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:

It is not a Bruton situation because —
As to him?
As to him It is not because
If his conviction rests only on the con­

fessions of the others that were introduced?
MR. TERRY;

— -because Robert Wood testified at

15
trial and he said Pickens was one of those people who came
through that door, and he was cross-examined and in crossexamination Pickens' counsel asked one question.

He said to

Robert Wood, "Did Wilber Pickens work for your brother?"

He

never contested the identification, and Robert Wood had just
identified his man as coming through —
QUESTION:

What you are telling me is there is

evidence other than —
MR0 TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— the confession —
Yes.
— to wit, the evidence of Robert Wood.
Yes, and that is different than Bruton.
Which of these defendants, if any or

maybe all of them, testified at the trial?
MR. TERRY:

Robert Wood.

the other three did not testify.
QUESTION:

Robert Wood testified and
j

Well, you told us there were five co­

defendants.
MR. TERRY:

Joe Wood did not either.

Joe Wood, the

reason I am treating him different is he made no statement
either.

He just
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:

But he was a co-defendant?
He was a co-defendant.
Only one of the five testified and that

16
was Robert Wood?
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
In the Bruton case., there was Evans whose

confession was the critical document or the critical fact, I
guess It was an oral confession testified to by some policeman
or someone, and Evans didn't testify.

Did Bruton?

Neither

of the co-defendants testified?
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:

No,
All they had was the confession of Evans

as reported by a third party and the trial court said you
can't use that except against Evans, and this Court held that
despite those instruction it was so damaging with respect to
Bruton and violated so greatly his Sixth Amendment right to
confrontation that that conviction was reversed.
MR, TERRY:

Is that it?

That’s accurate.

QUESTION:

But neither Evans nor Bruton testified9

MR. TERRY:

Neither one testified and there was no

redaction.
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:

Right,
And an examination of this Court found

in rendering an opinion that Evans' confession was just about
it against Bruton.

As a matter of fact, later on Evans'

conviction was reversed because —
QUESTION:

Well, that had happened before the ease

got here, as I remember it

17
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:
MRo TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR* TERRY:

Right.
Isn’t that correct?
Correct, before it got here*

So —

We Just had Bruton’s case here.
That’s correct*

And Bruton, the weight

of the evidence in the record against Bruton was Evans’ con­
fession which was hearsay*
QUESTION:

Although the trial had been told by the

trial Judge to disregard with respect to Bruton*
MR. TERRY:

Yes, they had and that is what this

Court said —
\

QUESTION:

The judge must have considered there was

evidence other than that confession to take the ease to the
Jury.
MR* TERRY:

I would think so, but I don’t think

that there was much in reading this Court’s opinion*

I think

this Court found that there wasn’t much other than that.
QUESTION:

Bruton was a federal prosecution, wasn’t

it?
MR. TERRY:

Yes, it was.

Yes, it was.

I think that if you go through the testimony in
this record other than the confessions, put the confessions
aside and go through everything else, go through Robert Wood’s
testimony, go through Tommy Thomas’ testimony, go through the
police officers’

ballistic report, go through the finding of

18
the weapons of Hamilton»

At the end of that review — there

was also a number of witnesses outside the apartment who
could not positively identify the people but could relate
physical characteristics»

At the end of that review, there

is only one question that is left and that is who were those
three people who broke down that door and came in there, what
was their names, who were they»

That is the only thing left

unanswered by the competent admissible evidence in this
record.»
That question is answered by the people who broke
down the door themselves»

They come in then, one by one, and

say "I did it, that was me,” and that is the only value, that
is the only value of their confession.

That is the only thing

that you p^et from their confession that you don’t already
have.

And you sort of have that, although you don’t have it

as well as any prosecutor would like to have it in Robert
Wood’s identification of them.
QUESTION:

Mr. Terry, may I come back a moment to

Pickens’ and Wood's testimony.
of your brief, at page 19s

I am looking at Footnote 27

"The petitioner is cognizant of

the district court’s finding that Pickens’ confession was
admitted in violation of Miranda.

The Court of Appeals’

decision affirmed this finding in the last sentence of its
opinion.

This Court limited the writ of certiorari to the

Bruton issue.”

How is there any Bruton issue here as to

19
Pickens?
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR0 TERRY:

Hew is there a Bruton Issue?
Yes.
Well, there is a Bruton issue.

He is

here complaining —
QUESTION:
plaining.

He * s not here complainings you’re com­

He is satisfied with what happened below.
MR. TERRY:

But I am complaining that the writ of

habeas corpus was issued because he has been successful with
a Bruton argument in the Sixth Circuit.

The Sixth Circuit

opinion says that Pickens' rights were violated according to
Bruton and they talk about Miranda In about two sentences
and I
QUESTION:

Well, if his confession was improperly

admitted, then I don't see how there |s anything about his
confession that affects the holding as to Bruton in his favor9
because he was then convicted only on the testimony of the —
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:

I agree with you.

I agree -»

In any event9 whether or not there might

also be a Bruton issue with respect to him, his conviction
has been reversed because of a Miranda violation.
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:

No.
Isn’t that correct?
No.

His confession has been struck

from this record because of a Miranda —

20
QUESTION:

Well3 therefore wasn’t his conviction

reversed,, for a new trial?
MR, TERRY:
QUESTION:
MRs TERRY:

That is generally the result.—

No, Your Honor®
~ if a confession is improperly admitted.
Not if you can say that there is still

enough evidence in this record to convict ■—
QUESTION:

No, no, no, at least that is news to me®

If a confession is wrongfully admitted at trial against a de­
fendant in a criminal case, regardless of the other evidence,
that conviction is reversed for a new trial, isn’t it?
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:

Well, I ~
Isn’t it?
I think that that has been the holding

of this Court in the past.
QUESTION:
MR® TERRY:

A good many times.
And what I urge with regard to Pickens

is —- and I mean to emphasise 'this., I don’t mean to give you
the impression that I think that we are as well off with
regard to Pickens as we are with Hamilton and Randolph.
QUESTION:

Well, all of these convictions were re­

versed by the Court of Appeals, were they not?
MR, TERRY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And Pickens was reversed because of,

among other — maybe two reasons, but one of them was that
his self-incriminatory statement was admitted against him in

21
violation of the Miranda rule and that would alone lead to
the reversal of his conviction* would it not?
MR® TERRY:

About the only thing the Court of

Appeals said about that was that they were reversing under
Bruton and they went through pages and pages —
QUESTION:

What is your second question in your pe­

tition for cert which xie refused to review?

Did this apply

to Pickens?
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:

It has to do with —
Whether the Court of Appeals and the

District Court violated 225fKd) by finding that one of the
respondents was denied his right to counsel» is that Pickens?
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR® TERRY:
it* not again.
you now.

Yes, sir.
But we refused to review that.
I know and I am not asking you to review

I already have asked you but X am not asking

I am not asking you to review that.
QUESTION:

So Pickens8 conviction was reversed for

that reason alone* if for no other?
MR„ TERRY:

Pickens' conviction* by reading the

Court of Appeals opinion* was reversed for violation of
Bruton®

In the bottom line of their opinion* the say* ,!We d©

not have to reach the Miranda issue or discuss it* but we
have looked at it and we agree with the District Court* and
that is about it.

22

QUESTION:

Even that Isn't technically accurate.

Federal habeas Courts of Appeals don't reverse convictions,
do they?

They either affirm or reverse the grant or denial

of the writ by the District Court.
MR* TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:

They issue the writ ©f habeas corpus*
That * s right.
In this case,, that meant that we had a

reasonable time to retry them or let them go*
I would like to reverse some time to rebut -«=
QUESTION:

Mr* Pickens,, Isn't he th® one that didn't

get any amount of this whole thing., the others got $50 apiece
and —
MR0 TERRY:

I think the only place you can make that

finding is in his own confession®

If you read everybody

else’s versions Pickens got as much as everybody else®
QUESTION:
MR. TERRY:
QUESTION:
MR, TERRY:

He got $50, too?
$50.
He claimed he didn't get anything.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Evans.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER L. EVANS, ESQ.s
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Mr. Chief Justice —
Are you going to deal with Mr. Pickens'

case differently from th® others., or not?

23
MR. EVANS:

Yes, If Your Honor please, on the one

hand, and no on the othere

For purposes of clearing the air

as far as the Bruton rule is concerned, I think that the
Court should consider the total picture of all the confes­
sions, but we will contend that the finding below that the
Pickens5 confession was inadmissible because of a violation
of Miranda constitutes a final adjudication on that issue
and his conviction should be reversed on that reason alone®
But in considering the whole Bruton issue and fch©
question of harmless error, 1 think that it would be good to
consider Pickens® confession along with the other three, and
this would support our contention that all three of these de­
fendants, including Pickens, were denied their right t© con­
frontation and cross-examination based upon the Sixth Amend­
ment to the U.S. Constitution and the past decisions of this
Court which have been rendered since the Bruton rule.
Now, the first issue involved in the matter coming
up from the Sixth Circuit was that Involving the interpreta­
tion of Bruton, Schneble and Harrington.

We maintain in ©wr

original response filed in opposition to the state8s petitIon
that the state has erroneously categorised the facts of this
case to Schneble and Harrington and more or less overlooked
the significance of the Bruton rule.
If you will notice in their briefs9 they discount
the importance of Bruton-, and I think that in ©very decision

of this Court has some constitutional significance and Bruton
certain!y stands as a landmark on the question of violat5.on
of right to confrontation and right to cross-examination.
As Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated in Davis v.
Alaska and also this Court in Pointer v, Texas and Douglas v.
Alabama, that the right to cross-examination io very much a
part of the right of confrontation as stated in our Sixth
Amendment to the United States Constitution#
This case in our opinion will present somewhat ©f
a precedent in the sense that it will clear the air on the
question of harmless error.

The eases of Harrington and

Schneble did not overrule Bruton, which Mr. Justice Brennan
wrote his well-reasoned argument on.

This case Is a ease, as

Mr. Justice Stevens indicated, involving the question of
harmless error.

And when we talk about harmless error, we

must look at Chapman v. California, Fahy v. Connecticut,
Schneble v. Florida, Harrington v# Calfornia, and the Court
has consistently stated that harmless error means harmless
error beyond a reasonable doubt.

It is the federal standard

which this Court should consider, as indicated in the ease of
Fahy v# Connecticut#
Now, the crucial facts of this case as they relate
to the respondents® convictions are subject to two basic
theories, the on® promoted by the state and the theory ©r
possible theory supported by us in our brief.

And the stats

25
has made a number of conclusory statements throughout this
proceeding which have indicated that the facts of this ease
show very clearly that these respondents were a part of a
plan to rob9 but a close examination and a view of the record
in our opinion could lead

this Court to conclude to the con­

trary, or certainly lead this Court to conclude that the
facts are not clear as to the respondents' involvement in
y

this whole proceeding.
Now, the District Court and the Sixth Circuit Court
of Appeals for purposes of ruling on Bruton accepted the
theory most favorable to the state on the question of the
respondents' involvement in this whole proceeding,
QUESTION:

All five respondents?

There were two

Wood brothers, and then there were three others, weren’t
there?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Is there any question about the involve-

ment of the Wood brothers?
MR. EVANS:

No, there is no question, as I under­

in our mind after reading the record?
MR. EVANS:
the Wood involvement.

There is no question in my mind as to
In fact, we contend that the Wood

brothers, possibly along with Tommy Thomas, the supposedly

Impartial observer —

He was the fellow lying on the floor?

MRa EVANS:

Right ■=» that the two or maybe the three

of them concocted the plan to — and we deny that that was
even In the plan, to rob the pokez* games
promoted by the state.

This is a theory

A close reading of the record and

even a close examination of Robert Wood’s testimony,, which
the state relies upon so heavily, does not really support the
theory in our contention about a plan to rob.
QUESTION;

Why do you think those three others came

there at all?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

If the Court would examine the —
They did come there, and the evidence

was that they swept a lot of money off the table, didn*t they?
MR. EVANS:
please.

That is not the evidence if Your Honor

The evidence shows that Robert Wood took all of feh©

money off the table, some of which was his own.

In fact, the

theory of the robbery is contained in the latter part ©f
Robert Wood's statement where he stated that if I caught the
gambler cheating then I was going to ask for my money back®
He didn't say he was going to get any of the victim’s money®
He says I am going to ask for my money back If I caught him
cheating.
QUESTION:

What do you suppose the reasonable fact­

finder could have found as to the reason that those three

2?
others came there at all that night?
MR. EVANS:

Mr. Justice Stewart9 if you would con­

sider the confession or the statement;, the oral statement of
Hamilton,, which was presented to the jury, a reasonable
conclusion could be drawn that Hamilton worked for Joe Wood.
He was asked to bring a couple or bring some of his friends
by this particular apartment. He may not have even indicated
the purpose of their coming by.

But assuming he indicated

that my brother was involved in a poker game and that he
felt that this other fell©** was cheating him and he might
just need some physical bodies present when he asked for his
money back* and this is why they went there„ because his boss
had told him X want you to come and maybe bring some of your
friends.

But we deny and the record would support ©ur con­

tention that these three respondents possibly did not even
have any weapons.
QUESTION:

Were the Wood brothers white men and the

three respondents Negroes?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

That is correct9 Your Honor.
That was my impression.
And the entire episode carries a very

interesting scenario and we have aj situation here where the
evidence that was presented,, if you really examine the
evidence presented before the jury and the state’s theory is
contained to a great extent,, Mr. Justice Stevens, in that

28
that evidence which was not admitted into evidence before the
jury.
On the question of harmless error, the Court must
consider what evidence was presented before the jury*

There

was the fact —
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR® EVANS:

Didn’t we take this on one point only?
Yes, if Your Honor please®
Well, how do we get to harmless error?
Involved .in the Harrington ease, the

specific Issue in Harrington and Sehneble assume a violation
of Bruton and the question was was there harmless error in
those cases®

In this particular case, the first issue ©r the

only issue before the Court as framed by the state ..Is whether
the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has
correctly interpreted the law as stated by this Court in
Bruton v. United States, Sehneble v, Florida, and Harrington
v. California®

So Harrington and Sehneble were cases dealing

specifically with or dealing only with **QUESTION:
there?

Well, why do you think Bruton is in

Bruton didn’t have anything to do with harmless error,

did it?
MR, EVANS:

Bruton stood for the proposition that

the admission into evidence of statements of co-defendants
which implicate each other and where these co-defendants d©
not take the stand and testify and be

available for cross-

29
examination violates the co-defendants* right to confronta­
tion and cross-examination»

argument, the only people that didn’t confess were those that
weren’t arrested.

Joe Wood was the link between these three

respondents and the one who actually fired the fatal blow»
Now, there are certain facts in this ease that are undisputed,
without any question»

Number one, Robert Wood was the person

who fired the fatal shot»

The state does not contend t© the

contrary»
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

He was the card player»
Yes, he was the card player»

Secondly,

neither of these respondents participated in the game nor
had they been in the room at any time prior to the shooting.
The state does not contend to the contrary»

Neither of

these respondents took any money from the game at all®
state does not contend t© the contrary»

The

In their brief in

fact they state that Robert Wood took all the money.

Well, a

30
closer* reading of the record indicates that he took some money
from the table and stuffed it in his pocket.

Another theory

might be that Tommy Thomas took the rest after everybody had
left.

But nevertheless the state admits that Robert Mood

took all the money ©n the table and stuffed it in hie pocket.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

Some of which he considered his anyway.
Rights some of which he considered

rightfully his.
QUESTION:

But taking money isn’t essential to the

crime of robbery under Tennessee law, is it?
MR. EVANS:

No, but these respondents were convicted

of murder in the perpets5ati©n of a robbery and »»
QUESTION:
MR® EVANS:
QUESTION:

But doesn’t robbery simply require the —
Forcible taking.
Or attempt to take with the threat to us©

great bodily force?
MR® EVANS:

If there was an attempt which was not

consummated, I believe «■« and the gentleman can correct me -«=*
that that would be an offense of attempted robbery.

But in

this case they were charged with murder in effect during a
robbery.
QUESTION:

So you haw to actually succeed under

Tennessee law in getting the money in order for it to b©
robbery?
MR. EVANS:

We will not go that far, if you please,

31
Mre Justice Rehnquist, in saying that the robbery had t© be
consummated at the time of the murder in order for that t© b@
a violation of the statute.

But what we would say is that

at the time of the murder, there had been no attempted
robbery and the murder took plaee — and if you would read
the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, which is a very in­
teresting analysis ©f the felony murder doctrine, the murder
took plaee before any attempted robbery, if there was in fact
a robbery, and before these three respondents came into the
room, if they came into th© room®
Now, the state contends on the theory of harmless
error that there Is other ©videos© in the record placing these
particular respondents at th© scene of the robbery or at th©
seen© of the crime®
QUESTION:
MR® EVANS:
QUESTION:

Assuming —*
Bidn8t Georg© testify to that?
Who wan that?
Didn't the man that testified, didn't he

say that they were there?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

But If th© court <■»*»
That was evidence, wasn't it?
No, if Your Honor please®

The testimony

was that he assumed that they were there, and the record will
show that throughout Robert Wood's testimony, when he was
asked directly whether these respondent® were those three
blacks who came Into the room after the robbery, his statements

32
were specifically,, °I assume they were because I met them f©r
a second after the robberyeM
QUESTION:

If h© met them for a second, isn5t that

testimony that they were there?
MRS EVANS:
QUESTION:

N©9 if lour Honor please.
Well, hew long did he have to meet them*

two seconds?
MR. EVANS:

He did not testify that they were there®

He testified {fI assume that they were there*w which in ©up
opinion is quite different®

He did not positively identify

these three respondents as those three blacks who ©am© into
the room after the murder was committed.

But assuming he did*

the only evidence that would be presented at that point is
that these defendants cam© into a room after a murder®

But

in order to convict them ©f murder in the perpetration ©f a
robbery* where it is quite clear that they did not do the
shooting and they did net @v@n do the robbing, there must be
a link and a plan, and that is what the Supreme Court ©f
Tennessee considered in reversing th© Court of Criminal
Appeals.
The Supreme Court ©f Tennessee felt that they were
nevertheless a part of th© plan to rob, and it is ©ur @©n=
tentlon that this plan is ©nly contained in th© confessions
of these three respondents9 and a close examination ©f th®
record presents serious questions even considering all th©

evidence.

ficiency of the evidense9 but

MR® EVANS:

For whatever reason the court did net

It was not raised in the state's petition for appeal from the
Court of Criminal Appeals,
QUESTION:

Of ©ours©, when we granted eertiorari,

we did not grant certiorari ©n the Miranda issue, did we?
MR® EVANS:

That is correct®

The issue that is

before this Court is whether the Bruton rule was violated mnif
more importantly9 in our opinion, whether the violation ©f
the Bruton rule was harmless error beyond & reasonable i@ubts
In considering the question ©f harmless error, th©
evidence presented before the Court is very much important*
The only evidence introduced was the testimony of five sup­
posedly impartial witnessess whose only testimony was limited
to their statements that they saw three blacks outside the
door of the apartment®
coming outside.

One witness says I saw three blacks

Another witness — two witnesses said a

white and three blacks®

But nowhere in the record could we

find any testimony of these supposedly impartial witnesses
that these respondents had any weapons in their hands, that
they did anything other than either appear at the d@@r and/@r
kick the door in®
The crucial testimony in this cast cones from
Robert Wood, who gave an Initial statement t© the police

^2
before his indictment In which h© stated wry clearly, WI
cannot identify these blacks that came in„w and consistent
with the original plan ©f Robert Wood., Joe Mood and T@«ty
Thomas to place all th® blame on three unidentified blacks.
And the record will shew in reading the statements ©f Tommy
f
Thomas and also of Robert Wood,, that Joe Wo@d8 Robert Wood,
and Tommy Thomas met after this ln@ide.nt to concoct a, plan t@
put this whole murder ©n three unidentified blacks who sup­
posedly cams into th© r©@iis shot the victim,, and left with
all the money.

But after some investigation, apparently the

police did not believe that version and subsequently in®
dieted the Wood brothers along with three respondents.
Now, I think that in considering th© question ©f
harmless error, the Court cannot turn its head t© th© complaints of coercion and, as the Sixth Circuit said, thorn
were some very vivid complaints ©f coercion and physical
abuse as it relates to these three confessionsa

And it would

be our contention that the existence of this kind of abuse
;>'v'

•

~

;

would create a sort ©f tainted character t© these confes­
sions.

We are not dealing with unchallenged confessions.

We are not —
QUESTIONS

Is that really before us, Mr® Evans,- on

• the petition that was granted?
MR. EVANS?

In considering th® taint of evidence

*3
Brennan In Harrington raised the question about in weighing
harmless — In effect9 weighing harmless error9 you must
consider the quality of the evidence on both sides9 the
quality of the untainted evidences the quality of the tainted
evidence.

And it is our position that there is very little

untainted evidence In this ease®

If there is any untainted

evidences it would b© the testimony ©f the five witnesses
outside the apartment who could not identify either ©f these
three respondents as the three blacks or the three H@gr@@s

QUESTION %

Your clients®

MR. EVANS:
course9 the court

The state contends they went in ani9 of

could possibly conclude that they did or

some of them did go into the apartment.

But the testimony ~

the confession of Hamilton^ which was admitted before the
courts showed that h© did not go into the apartment and this
is consistent with the respondent’s theory that on@@ the
door was kicked in primarily by Joe W©od8 they looked insido
th© do0rs saw a whit® figure lying on the floor9 they turned
and went away.

But because Toimy Thomas and Robert W@@d and

Joe Wood had concocted this theory about th© blaote involvement in order to maintain some credibility in court, it i®
our contention that Robert W©od9 Tommy Thomas consistently
maintained that these blacks did in fact com® into th© apartment and did in fact fir© some shots and rob him3 and s©
forth®
But th© record is vary clear that th® ©videnc® of
these thr@© respondents* involvement is very shady and that
without these confessions there is no reasonable way th@§©
respondents could have been convicted of murder in th© per­
petration of a robbery.
