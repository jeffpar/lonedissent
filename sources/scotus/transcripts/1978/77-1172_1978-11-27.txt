MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this afternoon in National Muffler Dealers against the
United States.
Mr. Gordon, you may proceed whenever' you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MYRON P. GORDON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GORDON2

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question for decision here is whether or not an
association of franchisees of a specific franchisor loses the
exemption under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue
Code as a business league, even though it might and does
otherwise qualify solely by reason of the fact that it does
consist of all franchisees of a particular franchisor-—-in
this case, Midas Muffler franchisees.
I should like to begin the argument by describing
very briefly this association, Petitioner in this case, and I
think it is best described in the words of Chief Judge
Kaufman of the Second Circuit who pointed out that it was
organised at a time when an internal struggle was taking place
within the parent company.

The franchisor and many of Midas8s

franchisees were concerned that they might suffer from the
pending corporate shake-up.
As a consequence of this, they formed the association

to secure themselves against the whims of a new Midas manage­
ment .
Judge Kaufman goes on to say, in a later portion of
his opinion?

"In its endeavors, the Association sought

generally to redress the inequality of bargaining power exist­
ing between-- MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

It seems, Mr. Gordon,

that that would be a little bit like a union being organized
when a non-union plant changes hands, with a new owner.
MR. GORDONs

Exactly similar to that, and we ~-’’-

the argument in our papers that there is great similarity
between a union and in this case, while not a union, never­
theless a group of businessmen, if you will, getting together
to bargain collectively with their franchisor; and that there
are many similarities between the union analogy and the
franchisee association analogy.
In any event, Judge Kaufman goes on to say that the
Association "has been a formidable force at the negotiating
table," which follows through exactly to the analogy between
a union and an employer.
So that the genesis of this trade association or
business league was protective and defensive; it's not a
profit-making organization-'-it was never intended to be that;
and, again, merely formed to redress an inequality of bargain­
ing power between an individual franchisee and a monolithic,

5
strong financially franchisor.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Gordon, I suppose it’s irrelevant, but

do we have very much money involved here taxwise at all?
MR. GORDONS

Well, there could be—-there is some

money involved here, and there could be significant amounts of
money involved, only because it is very frequently the case
that a franchisee organisation builds up a reserve to have as
kind of a war chest, if you will, and during those times that
it builds up the reserve when its income exceeds the amount of
its outgo for any particular period of time--for one year, two
years, or three years,, or any time—and it shows an excess of
income over expenditures, there is that much involved.

We are

dealing here with several years? it may involve a substantial
sum of money.

I have not figured it.

QUESTIONS

I suppose I should ask government counsel

that question really, because they have other cases presumably.
It didn't seem to me as though it would make a great deal of

(

difference.
QUESTIONs

You are not one of those non-profit or­

ganisations with a million-dollar war chest.
MR. GORDONS

Well, we don't have a million-dollar

war chest in this case, and —
QUESTIONS
MR. GORDON:

But you could get one.
We could—but, on the other hand, I

would say, your honor, that if any association, any business

6

league or trade association, ever built up an unnecessary
accumulation of surplus.

The Internal Revenue Service has

plenty of tools ——
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't they first have to drop

the word "non-profit"?
MR, GORDONS

That’s correct.

And "non-profit" means

essentially —
QUESTIOW:

Won-profit.

MR. GORDON:

— and it's defined in the statute,

that no part of the income goes to any individual, association
member, so the amount of money I don’t think is an issue here.
QUESTION:

Your client gets what, dues and contribu­

tions from its members?
MR. GORDON:

This Association is solely financed by

dues from its members, that's correct.

And those dues ma\y be

raised from time to time, may be lowered, as the case may be,
in order to deal with specific situations.
QUESTION;

Would it make any difference to your case

if they had a million dollars or two million, instead of what­
ever it is that they have?
MR. GORDON:

MR. GORDON:
QUESTION;
MR. GORDON:

It might, it might then be said ——
In this case in its present posture?
No, not to this case.
That would be some future case.
That's correct.

In some future case, if

?
it is determined that there was an unreasonable accumulation,
that perhaps it had lost its so-called non-profit status be­
cause of the way it operated, as I say, I am sure the Internal
Revenue Service has adequate means with which to check on that
and change the ruling or look at it.
QUESTION:

Well, non-profit—you have to file re­

turns .
MR. GORDON:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon.
Don't non-profit organizations have to

file returns?
MR. GORDON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORDON:

Y©s, they do.
So it would be easy to check on it.
That’s right; they file annual returns

and are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service the
same as any other organization, and if it is found, as indi­
cated, that they are no longer non-profit, there are adequate
means at the Internal Revenue Service to correct it.
QUESTION:

Well; if you win this case, will you have

to file any returns?
MR. GORDON;

We have been filing returns, your

honor.
QUESTION:
MR. GORDON:

You are exempt from taxation.
We have filed returns as non-exempt

from taxation, claiming that there is —
QUESTION:

No, as exempt from taxation, don’t you?

we have been denied the exemption * we have been filing regular
returns under protest* and we have filed for refunds in each
case—and that’s hot*’ we get here* because —

the statute.

Yes, sir.
—- will you continue to file returns?
Certainly.

We are required to under

We file special forms of returns—! don’t knew

the form number--as a non-profit organization.
QUESTION?

1 see.

Now* more than that* as an or­

ganization that comes under this particular statute.
MR. GORDON?
QUESTION?
MR. GORDON?

That’s correct.
Not just as any non-profit organization.
No* no* no-—as one under 501(c)(6)* we

would be required to file annual income tax returns.
QUESTION:

Well* there’s no general statutory exemp­

tion for non-profit corporations* is there?
MR. GORDON?
QUESTION?

No* sir* there is not.
And (6) is one of about what—sixteen or.

■ seventeen different sub-categories of groups that are exempt?
MR. GORDON?

That is correct.

And this category—

if I may go to the statute now—the business league?

the

statute* which was passed in 1913 (and I should say in passing

9
that it was long before franchising was known to the economy
of the United States), granted an exemption from income tax
to business leagues, chambers of commerce, and boards of trade»
And there were two amendments subsequently%

in 1928 real

estate boards were added to the list of exemptions; and in
1966 football leagues were added to the list of exemptions.
And no place in the statute is there any further definition
of "business league,"

The only thing that we do have is a

statement that it is not organised for profit and no part of
the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private
shareholder or individual.
And that is the entire statute,
QUESTION:

What would you think about a baseball

league under that statute?
MR. GORDON:

I don't know why football leagues, I

confess, have been preferred over baseball leagues—I do not
know; I have no knowledge of that.
In any event, the only reason now that we have been
denied the exemption is the claim that a business league must
be similar to a chamber of commerce or a board of trade.

We

contend that that position is not warranted by either the
legislative history, judicial history, or in fact by the way
the Internal Revenue Service has itself treated business
leagues and other trade associations.
Actually, in the regulation, which has been in effect

10

for many, many years™-'the first sentence, with some modifica­
tions , has been in effect for many, many years—-it sayss

"A

business league is an association of persons having some com­
mon business interest, the purpose of which is to promote such
common interest and not to engage in a regular business of a
/

kind ordinarily carried on for profit."
We submit thjat that sentence properly states the
intent of Congress and does define what a business league is.
Mow, peculiarly enough, in 1929 there was something
added to the regulation—-and in 1929, for the first time, we
find the second and third sentences indicating that the busi­
ness league is supposed to toe an organisation of the same
general class as a chamber of commerce or board of trade, and
thus its activities "should be directed to the improvement of
business conditions of one or more lines of business..."
However, before 1929 that was not. the rule.

And

we have handed up to your honors something that I apologise
for having found late, but nevertheless of great importance,
I think—-and that is that before the 1929 amendment, there was
a specific sentence, the second sentence of the regulation:
"Its work"—-meaning the business league's work---“need not be
similar to that of a chamber of commerce or board of trade."
How, what happened between 1913 and 1929 to justify
that complete 180-degree turnabout in the Internal Revenue
Service's position, X don't know.

11
QUESTIONS

Whan was this regulation that you handed

up adopted,, do you know?
MEo GORDON %

It was adopted under the 1926 statute,

to the best of my knowledge it was a. continuation of what had
gone before»
QUESTION::

The statute or the regulation?

MR» GORDONS

Well, the regulation, sir—-every time—

what they did was, when they revised the Internal Revenue Code
during various periods of time, they re-adopted the statute,
and the regulation was changed each time,
QUESTIONS

What 2 am trying to get ac is the con­

temporaneousness of the regulation»

To me it would make more

of an impression if the regulation had been adopted simulta­
neously with the statute than if it were changed, say, forty
years later, if you suggest that it was,
MR. GORDON;

No, X suggest that I know it was in

effect since 1926, and it may have been in effect—perhaps
Mr» Smith knows more about that than X do at the moment—to
the best of my knowledge that was the rule all the way back
to the adoption of the statute.
QUESTION;

That certainly would be easy to track

down.
MR. GORDON;
QUESTION;
MR. GORDON;

Yes, it will.
The regulations are still esstant.
And if X may submit the other

12
regulations at the conclusion of the argument, I would be
grateful for the opportunity to do so, so that your honors
have the full picture.
As I say, I must apologize»”! didn’t realize until
the last minute that there had been that change, and that’s
why I only handed up what I found at the very last minute, on
Wednesday.
But we look and see what was the reason for the
change, and the only reason that we have been able to deterraiite—the only reason for the change in 1929—was the state­
ment which appears in the government’s brief, that it came
about, as a result of a case of the Board of Tax Appeals in
1928.

And there is no other legislative history that w© can

find on that.

And the fact is, if that were the case, there

is nothing in that case which in any way justifies the change
and this 180-degree turn in the regulation.
\

Before I get to that, however, I would irke to pom
out that the statute 1 don’t think needs the application of
La.tin maxims, such as noscitur a sociis, as has been used
several times in the past, in order to determine what a busi­
ness league means.
that there shall

In other words, if the statute had said
be an exemption for a chamber of commerce

or a board of trade or other business league, then it might
very well be said that the Congress had in mind that "other
business league55 might have the same general characteristics

13
as a chamber of commerce or a board of trade»

But we don61

find that? we find these in the disjunctive-business league
separately, chamber of commerce separately, and board of
trade separately»
So that there is nothing that I can see in the sta­
tute itself which warrants any construction that says that the
business league must he similar and have similar characteris­
tics to a chamber of commerce or board of trade, and, as I
pointed out before, in fact the Internal Revenue Service took
the opposite position up until 1929.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly there are distinctions

between a professional football league and a chamber of com­
merce »
MR. GORDONs
tainly are.

There certainly are, sir? there cer­

I have tried to determine the reason for the in­

clusion of football leagues in the 1966 amendment, and I have
been told on the one hand it9s a Congressional aberration,
which may very well be, and on the other hand that nobody
really knows the reason, that they were always exempt, that
they were just put in to make sure that the exemption was
granted to them.

But the fact of the matter is, as your honor

has pointed out, that if we are going into these characteris­
tics s and have the same general characteristics—and even if
we assume that a real estate board, which was added in 1928,
has the same general characteristics, then your honor is quite

14
right,

I see no justification for categorising a football

league and putting it in the same category as a chamber of
commerce or a board of trade.
And it strikes us that this evidences an intention
of Congress not to make them similar—and never was intended
to be similar.
QUESTION %

Has anyone shad any light on why basket­

ball leagues and baseball leagues are not in the Act, except
perhaps they didn’t, have a lobby?
MR. GORDON %

No—it may very wall do that,

I have

also been told that football leagues were always considered
exempt, but there was some question because football leagues
were operating pension plans, and they put that phrase in,
which may or may not operate a pension plan, as a way to make
sure that, they got their exemption.
But I merely point out that the football league,
whether or not it operates a pension plan, as has been pointed
out, is hardly in the same category as a chamber of commerce
or a board of trade.
QUESTION:

It was also concluded years ago that

football teams weren’t worth anything.
MR, GORDONS
QUESTIONs
MR. GORDON:

That may be, sir.
That’s not true today.
Yes, it may be.

But we look and see

if there is any legislative history which will shed any light,

15
and the government says the only legislative history it has
found is some representations to Congress back when the exemp­
tion was originally adopted by the United States Chamber of
Commerce, glorifying the effect of non-profit associations
of businessmen.
1 would think that that is hardly a substitute for
some language by any of the legislators or some language in
any committee report which indicated that that was the intent
of .Congress.
And 1 think it is reaching pretty far to take selfserving declarations of the United States Chamber of Commerce
and say that that constitutes a matter of precedent for determining that that was the intent of Congress?

the Congressional

intent may be determined by people who plead before Congress
for a specific exemption.
**w>

Now, there is no question about the fact that if we
are correct, and that the business league is properly defined
in the first sentence of the regulation, that the appellant
in this case meets every phase of that intent.

It fits the

first sentence of the regulation.
It strikes us, therefore, that the language of the
statute, the regulation as it existed prior to 1929, the first
sentence of the regulation, the lack of any other judicial
precedent except, of course, the decision of the Seventh
Circuit which was contrary to that of the Second Circuit—and

16
that5 s why we are here , I guess-—that by definition Petitioner
is entitled to the exemption, as a matter* again * of simple
statutory construction.
QUESTION:

So you would take the same position that

the regulation had always been like it is now?
MR. GORDONs
QUESTION:
MR. GORDON:

I could, I could take that position.
Or you would, I take it.
I would because I think that that regu­

lation was intended to do something less than is now claimed
for it.

I think if the regulation ware read carefully, you

would find that what it attempts to do is make a distinction
between improvement of business conditions-—because in that
sentence it says "as distinguished from the performance of
particular services for individual persons,™ so that in effect
we can see that any group, business league or otherwise, that
is formed for the purpose of performing services, particular
services for its members, which the members could themselves
do, except that possibly, like a cooperative buying organisa­
tion, they can do it more cheaply--they are not entitled to
the exemption, that was not the intent of Congress under these
circumstances.
But as distinguished from that, any other group of
businessmen that have a common business interest and form to­
gether to promote that common business interest are, we
submit, entitled to ths exemption.

And that was definitely

17
the intent of Congress»
QUESTION:

Well, how long has the statute been in­

terpreted and applied as the government is seeking to interpret
and apply it?
MR, GORDQMs
QUESTION:
MR. GORDONs

Only sines 1929, your honors»
Only since 1929.
But the first sixteen years, which X

think might be a lot closer to the original —
QUESTIONs

Let's assume from the very outset that

it had interpreted and applied the law this way, and the
Revenue Code had gone through all the changes that it has
gone through since then, and the statute was never amended.
MR. GORDON:

I would sav that under those circum­

stances we would have a different case, but this is not the
same case here.

In the first place, —

QUESTIONs

Well, maybe if the Commissioner could

have applied it from the outset the way he now wants to apply
it-*“-ifc53 just that in .1929 h© changed his mind.

We have had

a good many cases where government officials have changed
their mind, and both interpretations have been in the statute.
MR. GORDON:

Well, it would strike me that if in

fact the Commissioner did change his mind, there should have
been a logical reason for the change of mind, and there should
have been something in either the judicial precedents or in a
review of the Congressional intent which would indicate that

18
that is what should have been done.
QUESTIONs

But if he has power to issue regulations,

he has power to issue regulations, and his regulation reflects
one view of the statute, doesn't it?
MR. GORDONS

But on the other hand—-ves, it’s true,

it reflects, his view of the statute, but unless that view is
reasonable, I submit that it is not entitled to the force of
law, even though it may have been encrusted on the books of
the Internal Revenue Service for almost fifty years—if in
fact it is not reasonable.
And to answer your honor's question still further,
the fact is that during these years since 1929, there was no
direct case similar to this until we come to the Pepsi-Cola
case in the Seventh Circuifc“-and in that case, as your honor
knows, they held that an association of franchisees was a
business league entitled to the exemption,

And that was the

only Appellate case directly on point until the National
Muffler case in the Second Circuit.
QUESTION s

But the Commissioner obviously never

acquiesced in that ruling.
MR. GORDONS

He did not acquiesce in it, that’s

correct.
QUESTIONS

And so in every other circuit he was

still applying the law the way he read it.
MR. GORDON?

It may very well be that he was applying

19
the law that way, but, as I say, I do not know of any specific
cases—you see, we tend to confuse, in the history of these
cases, in the long history of' these cases, statements of socalled general principle which are really not applicable, be­
cause in the Second Circuit case, which originally determined
this case, which originally used that term noscitur a sociis,
and which quoted from the regulation—the fact is, it was not
an issue.

There there was a group of people, a group of

businessmen, who got together to do something for themselves
that they could have done for themselves,

hn& that case could

have very well been decided on the simple ground that they
were clearly not exempt, and there was no necessity to go into
all of these questions,
I think that 1 would like to conclude ray argument,
if your honors please, by pointing out that there is no logical
basis for the distinction made in this case.
We have pointed out before that franchisees of a
single franchisor have a common business interest, as defined
in the regulation—protection against a powerful franchisor.
We have pointed out that that common business interest is more
compelling than may obtain for other groups; of businessmen.
We have pointed out in our petition for the writ in this case
the burgeoning position of franchising in this country, in
the: millions and millions and millions of dollars that are
being spent by the public with franchise organisations, and

20

the necessityp if you will, for franchisees to band together
to do the very thing the petitioner in this case did.
We have pointed out that there was one case only
recently, in one of the district courts, in which a judge
pointed to the great need for a—-one of the traditional con­
trol mechanisms of a franchisor has been to keep its franchi­
sees disorganized.

Franchisees by necessity must have access

to the franchise group in order to act together, to deal with
common problems, whether those problems be the oppressiveness
of the franchisor or some less momentous concern.
QUESTION %

Wasn61 that involved in the Dairy Queen

case in the Second Circuit?

I don't mean your quote there.

Wasn't that point in there?
MR. GORDONs

I don't think so, sir.

At least, I

have not come across it in that context.
So we ask, finally, I think, by what logic can it
be argued that a group of businessmen who join together to
Is

bargain with a union are exempt—and they are? there is no
question about it, not only, as has been pointed out, are the
union workers getting together to bargain with their employer
exempt, but groups of businessmen may get together to bargain
with a union of their employees—and they are exempt'—by what
logic can a distinction be made between that group and a group
who join together to bargain with their franchisor?
We see no way that these can possibly be distinguished

21
logically»

We believe that the Seventh Circuit was right in

its holding, and we submit that the case should be reversed
here»

Well, Mr. Smith?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATE OF AMERICA
MR» SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
Although the Petitioner denies it, we see the import
of his argument as a challenge to the validity of a Treasury
regulation that has been outstanding for a3.most fifty years.
The regulation in question is sat forth at page 37 of the
appendix to our brief.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Smith, you will comment on the form

of the regulation prior to 1929?
MR. SMITH;

Yes, I shall.

The regulation says;

"A

business league is an association of persons having some common
business interest, the purpose of which is to promote such
common interest and not to engage in a regular business of a
kind ordinarily carried on for profit.”
The Petitioner would stop here.
The regulation, however, goes on to say;

esIt is an

organisation of the same general class as a chamber of coramerce
or board of trade.

Thus, its activities should be directed to

the improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of

22
business as distinguished from the performance of particular
services for individual persons."
NoWp the Court has said on many
QUESTION:

You are not going to answer Mr. Justice

Blackman6 s question right now then?
MR. SMITHS
QUESTION:

I will be happy to do that.
Well* I want to ask you a question, but

if you are going to answer his, I was not going to ask you
mine.

If you are not going to answer his now* I will ask you

mine.
MR. SMITH.-.

I will answer his and then I will turn

to you.
The regulation that my brother has cited and distri­
buted to the Court was issued under the Revenue Act of 1918
and stood outstanding until the Revenue Act—through the
/

Revenue Act of 1926.

In 1928 Congress added the phrase "real

estate boards,'5 and the Board of Tax Appeals in the interimwell, two things happened.

The Bureau of Internal Revenue

issued a legal opinion, which we set forth at page 20 of our
brief (L. 0. 1121), which discussed the general construction
of the statute and it held there that a stock exchange ’was not
a tax-exempt business league.

Three years later, as we point

out, the Board of Tax Appeals ruled that a corporation organi­
zed by associations of insurance companies to provide printing
services to their member companies was not an exempt business

23
league»

And, in so holding, the Board said that a business

league to be entitled to the exemption should be engaged in
and limited to activities similar to those of the ordinary
chamber of commarce or board of trade.
As a result of that decision, as we say in the brief,
the Commissioner revised the regulation to its present form
in order to incorporate what we see as the correct construction
of the statute.

And that has been the outstanding construc­

tion of the statute for almost fifty years.

And that is that

the statute, talks about business leagues, chambers of commerce,
real estate boards, and boards of trade, and that those

I think not.
MR. SMITHS

Not in the same detail, no.

But I think

the point simply is that the Commissioner in 1329 construed
this—changed his mind, as Mr. Justice White put it, and that
is that the intent of Congress, as we set forth in our brief,
is that this statute came in in 1913 at the behest of the
United States Chamber of Commerce, emphasising th© quasipublic civic nature of these broad-based organisations, or­
ganisations that are supposed to benefit a broad spectrum of

some concern expressed as to whether the pension plan con­
stituted an inurement to the benefit of the members, and it
might be disqualified under that basis.

Congress added the phrase 53or professional football leagues,

MR. SMITH?

Well, a pension plan—it might be con­

QUESTION?

Well, it’s certainly a broad disclaimer,

whether or not they operate a pension plan.
MR. SMITH?

Well, that's right.

that that was the reason for the insertion of the provision for
football leagues.
But putting all that aside, X don’t think that this

QUESTION?

MR. SMITH;
QUESTION;

It’s close to a monopoly, isn't it?
Well, you know
Or is it worse than a monopoly?

Even a

monopoly, we could get a team, I imagine™if we paid enough.
MR. SMITH;

I suppose that's so, but I think the

point of all this is, is that if Congress wants to legislate
specifically with respect to professional football leagues,
whether or not they administer a pension fund, that really

29
doesn’t help the Petitioner in this case, because I think that
this case turns on the validity of the provision in the regula­
tion that the activities of the (c)(6) organisations should be
directed to the improvement of business conditions of one or
more lines of business, and the Court of Appeals held in this
case—and I think quits properly—that this organization was
not directed to the improvement of business conditions of one
or more lines of business? it was simply directed to the
improvement of the conditions of Midas franchisees.
QUESTION?

Mr. Smith, if you finish out that third

sentence in the regulation after the words "more lines of bu­
siness," you go on to the language "as distinguished from the
performance of particular services for individual persons,"
which I take it is what is not permitted in the exemption.
What are some examples of the "performance of par­
ticular services for individual persons"?
MR. SMITH %

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the cases

that we discuss in our brief cite some examples—the produce
stock clearing association upon which the Court of Appeals
cited the earlier Second Circuit decision (that was an organi­
sation of stockyard owners which—stock dealers, you know,
which provided for clearing services for its members); the
Evanston Hortfa Shore Real Estate Association, which was a
Court

q£

Claims case, which operated a multiple listing ser­

vice for its members.

There is another old Sixth Circuit case

30
called Automotive Electric Association*, the principal activity
of which was to publish a catalogue, advertising the products
of its members.

These kinds of things are regarded as per­

formance of particular services for individual persons.

Association falls under the head of “performance of particular

tion in two parts.

Well, I would have to answer that ques­
I think principally its activities are not

directed to the improvement of business conditions of one or
more lines of business it flunks

that part of the regula­

tion.
QUESTION*

Well, is that a two-part test?

I would

have read that sentence as just meaning these are the kinds
of things that fall on one side, and these are the things that
fall on the other, not that you have to go through both A and
B in order to qualify.
MR. SMITH:

One can read the regulation the way you

suggest.
QUESTION:

It's quite difficult to read it other­

wise .
MR. SMITHs

Well, but the courts have uniformly read

it the other way, as an existence of two different tests? in
other words, you have got to be engaged in activities which
improve business conditions of one or more lines of business,

31

and you also can't perform particular services for individual
persons.
QUESTIONS

Well* what reason do those courts give

for the inclusion of the words S3as distinguished from," if
they are correct in their reasoning?
MR. SMITHS

Well, I think that what those courts have

said is essentially, that-—well, X think the courts have read
that sentence to provide for a positive requirement and also
incorporating a negative requirement»

Now, X suppose the best

way to construe-*—X mean, the way we construe the regulation
is as fol.lov.rss

on the one hand you've got? you must meet the

line of business requirement of the regulations—that's what
the Court of Appeals held and that is what this taxpayer un­
questionably does not meet»

And X think that the purpose of

the regulation, by setting forth another negative polar ex­
ample, is to assure that--is to provide a kind of bright-line
rule on the theory that most organisations that provide ser­
vices, particular services for individual persons, would be
the kinds of organisations that will not—activities will not
be directed across one or more lines of business.

And let

me
QUESTION:

Then it9s not a two-part test really;

it's just illustrative on the one hand, and illustrative on
the other»
MR, SMITH:

X suppose that's right.

Wow, in this

32

particular case, 1 think, you know, you can really see how
the two parts of the sentence of the regulation more or less
come together in the—you know, as applied to the facts of
this case.

Here you have an association of Midas muffler

dealers? they exclude everybody else.

Midas, by undisputed

stipulated fact, constitutes about 21 percent of the market.
The whole thrust of this organization's activities is to
boost the competitive position of Midas vis-a-vis

the rest

of the muffler industry.
QUESTION:

Couldn't we tell from this record, fir.

Smith, what would happen if one of these dealers decided to
leave the Midas franchise and take one of the competing fran­
chises?

Could he still remain a member of this organisation?
MR. SMITH:

On paper, yes, in the sense that—what

happened in this particular case was the taxpayers' original
by-laws provided that you had to be a Midas franchisee to be
a member; they then dropped that more or less as a cosmetic—
I think there's no doubt about that—as part of their campaign
to get the exemption.
But it is undisputed here that you had to be a Midas
member and Midas franchisee to continue to be a member under
both the old and the new version of the by-laws.

And I think

the answer to your question is that they would be dropped as
a member.

In fact, all the correspondence talks about. "Dear

Fallow Midas Dealer"—I don't think there is any question that

33

if you left the Midas family, you would be dropped from membership.
QUESTION:
MR» SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, you would drop yourself as a member»
Sure»
There would be no possible reason for

your belonging to the organisation, would there, if it is only
to service and to be of help to Midas franchisees?
MR. SMITH:

Well, it's possible, I suppose--one could

continue to be a member in order to receive the benefit of
what the competition is thinking»
QUESTION;

If you don't gat much mail, maybe.

There

would be no reason to continue to pay dues»
MR, SMITH:

Unless you felt there was some need to

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, you said the whole purpose of

this organisation was to improve the competitive position of
the members vis-a-vis other muffler dealers. Your opponent
argues that the purpose is to Jargain more effectively with

the franchisor.
Now, they are two different concepts.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION;

Yes.
What is there in the record that, supports

your view of the relationship?

I was quite persuaded that it

was basically a bargaining organisation, sort of like a union,
to help them renegotiate the contract terms and handle problems

34
on terminations and things like that»
MR. SMITHs

Well, I think that the part of the facts

that I was referring to are sat forth in our brief at
QUESTIOMs

I thought your argument was quite differ-

ent, that you in effect interpolated the word "entire” into
the regulation* and said it must not only be directed toward
improving business conditions in one line of business* but it
must improve business conditions in the entire line of busi­
ness —and you then define

the line of business to be muffler

dealers.
MR. SMSTHs

Yes* the muffler—you know* it does

flunk that.
QUESTION;

In other words* you pretty much adopt

the reasoning of Judge Kiley's dissent in the Seventh Circuit?
MR. SMITHs

Exactly? in other words* what Judge

Kiley said in his dissent in the Seventh Circuit is that
bottling Pepsi-Cola is not a line of business.
QUESTION;

It's only a fragment of a line of busi­

ness.
MR, SMITHs

Bottling soda is a line of business.

But getting back to your question* Mr. Justice Stevens* X.think
that the principal fact is that this association pay fifty
percent of the cost of a market study in order to maintain and
strengthen the position of Midas in the muffler replacement
business.

And it also established committees to “help make

35

the Midas program an ongoing source of profit for everyone»'3
Those two things are set forth at page 31 of our brief»
QUESTION s
MR, SMITHi

The market study and the
And one other thing is that it set up a

kind of monitoring of pipe prices in order to assure that it
receives the lowest price pipes from Midas International, in
order to make sure that it could, I suppose, do its

work at

prices lower than the competition.
QUESTION;

There are a number of trade associations

that represent maybe sixty or seventy percent of an industry,
that don't have 100-percent membership, because some of them
emphasize certain aspects of the business.
Are they generally granted the exemption or not?
Do you have a 100-percent requirement?
MR. SMITHs

Qh, I don't think you have to have a

100-percent requirement, but I think-—you know, this case is
sort of, in our view, a blatant case because it essentially
excludes, you know, by undisputed estimation, 79 percent of
the industry.
QUESTIONS

What if everything they did would be

beneficial to the people in the muffler industry, but they
happen to have their membership comprised just of franchise
dealers for Midas?

Say, in other words, they took a lobbying

position on tax legislation, and things trade associations
generally do, but their membership happened to be composed of

36

just twenty percent of the industry and people all handling
the same product?
Would that toe disqualified because it is not a broad
enough base?
MR, SMITHS

I would think it probably would be* but,

of course—-and I think the answer simply is that, you know,
it's difficult for the Service to administer a statute where,
you know, you could say, well, this organization, though it is
not broad-based, really provides direct and. indirect benefits
to the industry as a whole, while this one, which is not
broad-based, is pretty narrow,

I think in order to sort of

reduce the energy needed to monitor these organisations, the
best way to insure that they are broad-based is to limit the
exemption to those organisations which open their doors to
people in the industry generally, and not have to rely on
kind of indirect benefits.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Smith, what if you had a Ford dealers

so ruled.

QUESTION:

But can, for instance, a Chrysler dealers

or an American Motor dealers association have quite different
common problems than Chevrolet dealers?
MR, SMITH §

They may well have different common

problems, and there may be an advantage to them to get fcogefcher and discuss them, but the (c)(6) exemption is limited to
those whose activities are directed across at least a line of
business.
QUESTIONS

Well, Mr. Smith, you haven't excluded

automobile associations because they don't include railroads,
MR. SMITHs

Of course, there are gradations of cate­

gorisation, and, you know, one could say, I suppose, that there
ought to be—you know, if you carry that to an extreme, there
ought to foe a single trade association for business generally.
But the Service has wisely refrained from taking that position.
QUESTIONS

This is an even more unfair question than

the ones I usually ask.

QUESTION;

Wall, we have got a lot of case® where w.

don't have conflict.
MR. SMITHs

Well, quite frankly, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

the acquiescence in this case was a source of a good deal of
concern to us only because--and it is a propos of your question

38

to Mr. Gordon earlier—there was very little money involved
in this case.

If you look at page 11a of the appendix, the

taxpayers8 complaint indicates that $5500 of tax involved in
this case —
QUESTION?

Had the Second Circuit gone the other way,

would you be here petitioning for cert?
MR. SMITH:

I doubt it very much.

But the point is,

we do think that the Second Circuit's decision is correct and
that the Seventh Circuit's decision is incorrect.
QUESTION?

Did the Commissioner announce his non­

acquiescence in the Seventh Circuit?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, in 1968.

And the industry is on-

in fact, in ©ur acquiescence we pointed out that there are
about thirteen pending applications presenting this issue,
so we thought everyone would benefit from the uniform rule.
And we think the uniform rule has been the rule that has been
extant since 1929, and that is that the liiie-of-business re­
quirement, as Judge Kaufman said, is well-suited to the legis­
lative intent of limiting the exemption to those organisations
/

that provide benefits to a broad spectrum of the business com­
munity and not simply Midas muffler dealers or Sacramento
tomato juice canners, or whatever—but tomato juice canners.
And you don't have to take the position that it has to be all
food or all juices or all beverages, and you don't have to
include the distillers if you want to have an organisation

39
limited to tomato juice processors.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, am X not correct that you do

grant the exemption to segments of an industry, without being
the whole industry, that are arranged to bargain with unions,
for example?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, there is a ruling that is discussed

in both briefs, that says that, but it is the broad base of
an industry.

It would be, for example, you know, the power

tool manufacturers, or whatever, rather than -QUESTION:

would be exempt.

QUESTION:

Well, here the doors are open, as far as

I understand the record, but nobody wants to come in.

It's

just like a Chevrolet dealez’ doesn’t want to join the Ford
dealers organization.
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think that really, if you will

permit me, blinks at reality, because while they changed their
by-laws, they never made any attempt to solicit non-Midas
dealers, and I think Mr. Gordon would agree that they have no
intention of doing that, that the whole thrust of the organi­
sation is to limit its members to Midas franchisees.

And I

think that the case has to be considered on that basis.

40
QUESTION:

You feel they should have had an affirma­

tive action policy?
MR. SMITH %

Well,, maybe in ten years we could see

the results of all of this and the Court could continue to
hold the case, I suppose.
QUESTION'S

Well, maybe the line is there, but I have

to confess I don't see in terras of what they do in the business
community why these people are significantly different from an
industry-wide trade association.
MR. SMITHs

Well, they are significantly different

because, as Judge Kaufman said, in short, the bulk of the
industry is excluded.
QUESTIONS

Well, the bulk of the industry doesn't

participate, but—what's the difference between a quarter of
an industry and a half of an industry, for example?

Say, they

had—also the Eayco dealers joined up with them, but all other
dealers stayed out, and then they would suddenly be entitled
to the exemption.

I don't understand why it is any different.

And they get together and they talk about how best to re­
arrange franchise terms and what to do when there is a termi­
nation of a franchise and all of this sort of stuff—I just
don't see the difference,
MR. SMITHs

I think the difference is simply that

junct ox Midas in the sense that it is designed to boost the

QUESTION s

You have farming groups that bargain with

the farmers; I mean, you know, milk dealers bargain with far­
mers over what the price should be.
MR. SMITHz

But I think the bargaining aspect of it

is not necessarily controlling, because I think the Second
Circuit said in a footnote, toward the end of its opinion,
"In pressing this argument, the Association notes the simila­
rity between itself and labor unions, which are granted an
exemption under 501(c)(5).

It has, however, made no claim

that it is qualified for an exemption as a labor organization.
We accordingly express no opinion with respect to the rele­
vance of that section under the Code."
I mean, here, you know, those rules that talked
about bargaining and provided for business league status,
you know, had a broad-based membership—and I think that, you
know, if people don’t—I think there is quite a difference
between closing the door to non-Midas people and opening the
doors and having no one choose to come in.

I think that that

is quite a big difference, and I don't think that this case

42
ought to be looked at on the basis of the fact that --QUESTION:

Well, it’s a big difference all right,

but what does if have to do with collecting taxes, that’s what
I don’t see.

The tax policy of which group should pay, you

know, should not have to file returns.
MR. SMITHs

Policy in this area is always difficult;

you know, one could make a case that lots of things, lots of
organizations engage in coraraendable activities, you know, that
benefit society—-General Motors does, as well, though it’s not
tax-exempt.
Here, I think, you know, the evidence is clear that
Congress wanted to benefit chambers of commerce, boards of
trade—-you know, and that business leagues were supposed to
be analogous to those kinds of things.

New, the accepted

definitions of "chambers of commerce" and "boards of trade"
are broad-based organisations, whether they, you know, like
the U„ S. Chamber of Commerce, which includes, you know, the
Fortune 500 and lots of organisations like that, whether it’s
a board of trade that may be the Milwaukee Board of Trade
that includes all sorts of businesses, both large and small.
Here we have, you know, the polar examples

line of business of baseball activity, although one, I suppose,

could argue to the contrary.

ter,, as of the moment, baseball leagues and similar sports
leagues that cover a broad spectrum of major sports activity
are enjoying the exemption,

I don51 know.

with that.
MR. SMITHs

Right, but I mean with respect to things

like professional football leagues; it'3 hard to imagine any­
thing more detailed than that.

I don't think one can analogiae

football to baseball, given the decisions of this Court.

No, if I said that, I didn't mean to say

it caxna in is more or less to ratify the activities of the
professional football league in administering a pension plan.
