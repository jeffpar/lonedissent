Greer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID Cv GREER9 ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GREER:

Thank you. Your Honor,

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it pleas® the Court:
I at least was pleased by having the respondents
in the Columbus case open by asking that this Court affirm
the findings of the trier of the facts, the trial court,
and I would hope that they would open their argument in
this case with the same request.
Let me open my argument by attempting to answer
in the context of Dayton a legal question and then a factual
question that has been posed in the context of Columbus.
At the time this lawsuit was filed in April of
1972, seven years ago, there were 57 elementary schools in
the Dayton School System, including the middle schools.
There were no all-white elementary schools.
three all-black.

There were

There wer eleven high schools in the

Dayton School District, non® of them were all-white; two
of them were all-black.

And as far as teaching staffs
i
I

;

.

were concerned, the teachers in the Dayton School System

•

were Integrated throughout the system on the basis of the
same ratio between black and white teachers in each school
as there was in the system as a whole.
To turn from the questions posed by Mr. Justice
Stewart and Mr, Justice Marshall to the question posed by
Mr. Justice Stevens, which is a legal question, was the
remedy in Swann correct, let me answer that at least In
part by saying that I would stand here and say that every
principle enunciated in Swann was correct.

Whether the

remedy was correct depends upon what the facts were when
that case went back to the trial court and how those facts
were presented to the court and what the findings were.
I think 1 stand her© In a culmination of a series
of decisions.

There has been some implication or direct

indication in some of th© briefs filed..that we are asking
the Court to overrule Swann or to overrule Keyes or to
overrule some prior decision.

We are not.

V/® are here

in a case of equity that turns on particular facts, and I

v

think that is important.
?

■ ■■

And I think the principles

: •

Vi’-' ;

’

•

:

enunciated in Dayton I grow directly from Swann and the
prior decisions of this Court.
It was in Swann that this Court said that the
remedial task is to correct a constitutional violation,
a condition that offends th© Constitution.

It was in

Swann that there was reference to the equitable powers of

5
this Court being remedial powers, corrective powers, and
that the nature of the violation is what determines the
scope of a remedy in a school desegregation case and any
other equitable case.
In Milliken, this Court held, that the remedy is
necessarily designed as all remedies are, to restore the
victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they
would have occupied in the absence of such conduct.

That

it seems to me Is clearly what the incremental segregative
effect standard of Dayton I is.
I would submit to the Court that as the trial
court found in this case, there was no system-wide viola­
tion.

I would also submit to the Court, however, that in

a case where there is a system-wide violation, the equit­
able principles applicable to cases of this nature require
a finding idLth respect to incremental segregative effect,
because the remedial purpose is a restorative purpose.

It

is not to compare what is to what ought to be in some ideal
world in which none of us can ever live.

It is an effort

to compare what is to what would have been in the absence
of violations.
And under the sharply defined standard of this
Court as expressed in Dayton, the remedy turns on a com­
parison between what Is and what would have been.
In Justifying a system-wide remedy in this ease,

6
the Sixth Circuit completely abandoned that comparative
test and it redefined the whole concept of incremental
segregative effect in terms of a snowballing process of
cumulative violations.
QUESTION:

The District Court on remand in this

ease, Judge Reuben found that there wasn't a system-wide
violation, didn't he?
MR. GREER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And he ultimately dismissed the case,

MR, GREER:

He dismissed the case flat, that’s

didn!t he?

correct,
QUESTION:

Did he find any specific Isolated

constitutional violations?
MR., GREER:

In three areas, he did,

Pre-1951,

in faculty assignments, there was a polioy of assigning
black faculty to teach in black schools.

There was in

1933 established a school, Dunbar High School, which had
a system-wid© attendance zone, and that school was attended
by black students,
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

Only?
Only.

That school went out of ex­

istence in 1962.
QUESTION:
MR, GREER:

What is it called now?
There is a Dunbar High School.

The

7
school that was Dunbar from 1933 to 1952, the physical
plant was turned into an elementary school named McFarland.
QUESTIONS

They are still predominantly Negro, I

assume, because Dunbar was a Negro.
MR. GREER:

Well, the fact that Paul Lawrence

Dunbar was a great Negro poet has no relationship to the
fact that Dunbar High School, new Dunbar or the old
McFarland, are attended primarily by black students today.
That fact is established by the residential complexion of
the neighborhoods they serve.
QUESTION:

There were 2H new schools constructed

between 550 and '72, and 22 of them were Negro or white.
MR, GREER:
QUESTION:
MR, GREER:
QUESTION:

Corr ee t.

Deliberately so,
Well, it depends upon the
It was accidentally or deliberately,

either one, it ends up that way.
MR. GREER:

Building the schools was deliberate,

sure.
QUESTION:

In 1971» 75 percent of the Negroes

were assigned to Negro schools?
MR. GREER:

By virtue of their neighborhood

proximity.

QUESTION:
Yes?

Answer my question and then add to it.

8
MR. GREER:

Yes is the answer’s Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Now you can add to it whatever you

QUESTION:

In answering my questions what was

want to.

the third —
MR. GREER:

If I may come back to that after I

have added my yes, comma, but, to Mr. Justice Marshall's
question.

I think the complete answer to that is that

while that is all entirely true, it overlooks the fact
that there was no feasible alternative for the board other
than the location of those schools as they were.

As the

plaintiffs’ own witnesses have testified, the only alter­
native to the program that you have just described was,
one, build a single campus in the City of Dayton and bring
all students bused to that, or, two, to adopt some system­
wide busing plan to —
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

Mr. Greer, that is as old as 19bb.
Well, whether it is new or —
The town case, that theory was made.
Whether it is new or old —
Well, why don’t you add onto it that

it is not new?
MR. GREER:

All right, if it is not new, it is

a fact in this case, that because of the residential
patterns in Dayton, those were the only available

alternatives.
To get back to your question, Mr. Justice
Stewart, the third finding was essentially a group of
Isolated practices all of which the court had found were
long gone years before this suit was filed and on which
the court found there was no incremental segregative
effect of those practices at the time of suit.

Separate

use of sxdjsmlng pools at Roosevelt High School for black
students and white students back in the thirties or
separate athletic competitions for Dunbar students up
to the forties, or back in early 1920 a situation at
Garfield Elementary School where the black students were
taught in a separate classroom.
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

This lawsuit was brought when?
1972, April.
And did the District Court find any

except for considering the continuing effect of these
historic acts of unconstitutional segregation by race,
did he find any then on-going conduct that violated the
Constitution?
MR. GREER:

Absolutely none, Your Honor, and

he specifically found that there was no continuing effect
of these prior practices in the three areas which I have
described.
To get back to what has happened with the legal

10
doctrines Involved in the remedy side of this ease between
Dayton I and what I guess will now be Dayton II, the
Sixth Circuit it seems to me has clearly completely dis­
torted and abandoned the concept of incremental segregative
effect.

That is in essence admitted in the briefs filed

in opposition t© us.

The National Education Association

brief points out that the Sixth Circuit described that as
a description of the manner in which segregation occurs
in a northern school system, rather than as a legal stand­
ard for determining how much school segregation must be
remedied.

That I would submit is a clear departure.
In their

4-page brief, the respondents never

discuss the Sixth Circuit’s handling of the concept of
incremental segregative effect.

They touch it in a foot­

note in a kind of confession and avoidance manner at page
128 of their brief, where they indicate that our approach
itfould be correct, relevant at least if this were a ease
of isolated segregative practices, which I submit to you
it is, but that the incremental segregative effect concept
has no application whatsoever to a situation of a systemwide violation.

I don't think that there is a double

standard expressed with regard to incremental segregative
effect In your opinion in Dayton I, nor do I think a
double standard is justified.

If the equitable purpose

is restoration, the goal, whether it is a system-wide

11
violation or isolated violations, is the sameQUESTION:

Of course, there is no remedy at all

until or unless there is a finding of a constitutional
violation, isn’t that correct?
MR, GREER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
The case we heard first this morning,

the Columbus case, involved basically, as I understood It
at least, the concessions made by counsel particularly, a
question of remedy.

This case at least initially involves

a question of whether or not there was a violation.

Isn’t

that correct?
MR. GREER:

Although because of what happened

to me in the Sixth Circuit, this case is both a violation
and —
QUESTION;

I know It is both, but at least is

initially a question of whether or not there was a
violation, Isn't it, because the District Court found
there wasn’t any,
MR. GREER:

That is absolutely correct.

And if

I may turn to that aspect of the case to discuss it, it
seems to me that it is clear that the doctrinal problem,
to get to the legal issue here, and where I believe the
Sixth Circuit has gone astray from the moorings provided
by your decision, the doctrinal problem at the violation
stage of this case lies in the substitution of what I

12
would refer to as a bed of procrustean presumptions for
the judicial analysis that is contemplated by Arlington
Heights, Washington Davis and Davis 1 decisions of this
Court.
If I can turn the phrase "loaded game board”
to a new us®, it seems to me that the series of presump­
tions that has been invented by the Sixth Circuit is a
means for requiring system-wide racial balance Is indeed
that.
The way that the analysis seems to work is that
whenever there Is a condition of current racial Imbalance
in the school's, which there certainly was in Dayton at tne
time suit was filed, then it is fair game to go back in
the past as far as may be necessary to find some constitu­
tional violation and then to juxtapose the current eondition of racial imbalance with a historical situation of
a constitutional violation by the welding material or
glue of a concept of an affirmative duty to diffuse the
races throughout the system.

Now, that it seems to me is

a far cry from the concept of the goal in the ease of
determining violation is to focus on the conditions that
existed at the time suit was filed, and then how you can
look to historical background to see if those conditions
ware created by some constitutional midconduet on the
part of th© school board, but you beg the question and

13
you get into circular reasoning if you say that there is
an affirmative duty to diffuse races throughout a school
system and therefore if that constitutional duty had been
followed, why9 the races would have been diffused at the
time suit was filed, and if they aren’t diffused there
must be a constitutional violation.

That I submit to you

is what the Sixth Circuit has done on the violation side
of this case* and I think that is error, and I think that
is departure from the precedents and rulings of this Court
and It Is also a situation that if that kind of reasoning
were adopted, any school system in which there is existing
racial balano® must b© subjected to a judicial remedy that
provides racial balance.
QUESTION:
MR. GREER;

You- mean racial imbalance?
Racial imbalance, I’m sorry.

Where

racial imbalance is found, the courts must provide racial
balance.

It is essentially what the Sixth Circuit is saying.

That is not simply an application of the Keyes burden
shifting principle.

That principle is, of course, triggered

by a finding of a current condition of intentional segre­
gation in a substantial or meaningful portion of the system.
This is triggered simply by a finding of racial imbalance,
and where racial imbalance is found, racial balance must
follow.

It is not a real presumption, it is an outcome

determinative

approach to finding violations.

14
Because of time constraints on oral argumenta I
want to focus on these legal issues and 1 have to refer you
to my brief for the factual analysis that I think fits
hand and glove them with them.
QUESTION:

Mr. Greer, I don’t think you are

really stating the theory of the Court of Appeals though,
are you?

They didn’t start from the fact there is presently

imbalance and then infer violation from that.

Didn’t they

start from the notion that there was proof of intentional
violation as of 1954, and a failure affirmatively to
correct the situation?

The relied entirely on the duty

to take affirmative action in effect.
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

They are talking about 1954
Right.
~ and they are putting the focus

there, rather than in 1972 when the suit was filed.
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

Right.
It is our contention that there was

no dual system in 1954 or in 1972 or any of the years in
i

between.
QUESTION:
MR, GREER:

Right.
But what they are doing is instead

of focusing on the existence of a violation at the time
suit was filed, it is using a double focus.

One is a

condition of racial imbalance at the time of suit, and the

15
other is a finding of an uneonstltutlonal act at some
time in the past.

They picked the year 1954 which I would

submit has the logic only of being the date of the Brown
v. Board of Education decision.
QUESTION:

Well, they say as of that date there

was a clear duty on the pari of the board to change a
situation they found to exist.

Now, I know you don’t ac­

cept the finding as of that time, and it is a failure to
have corrected in the interval amounts to a present
violation today,
MR. GREER:

And that is where you get what I

call the glue or the weld, and that is this affirmative
duty — and the words of the Sixth Circuit are an affirma­
tive duty to diffuse black and white students throughout
the system.
QUESTION:

Well, there would be such a duty,

would there not, If they are right about the dual system
in 1954?
MR. GREER:
Honor.

I don’t think there would, Your

I think that the constitutional duty as it has

been defined in this Court is to provide a unitary system,
and what is a unitary system, a unitary school system as
this Court has defined that term, it is — in the
Alexander ease, for example, a unitary system is one
within which no person is to be effectively excluded from

16
any school because of race or color.

The ACLU, and this

is —
QUESTION:

Let me just test thats because this

goes really to the heart of the case.
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

It does, indeed.
Supposing you had a de facto situation

with all black and all white schools, totally the same,
and then all they did was change rules and say anybody
can go to any school within three-quarters of a mile of
his home or whatever the boundary was, but there was no
change in boundaries.

You would have to change the boun­

daries to correct the situation, and you say there is no
duty to change boundaries?
MR, GREER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
Say they were gerrymandered and all

the rest of it, just to make sure there are no blacks go­
ing to white schools and vice versa.

Could they leave

the situation exactly as it was?
MR. GREER:

I think they could, Your Honor,

under my understanding of the Constitution.
QUESTION:

Let's take a school system in that

region of the country which up until 195*1 had legislation
on the books requiring the segregation of school children
based upon the color of their skin,, and in 195*1, in Brovm
•

\

V

v. Board of Education, that legislation was held to be
\

17
unconstitutional.

Certainly it then became incumbent

upon the school boards of some school districts in that
part of the country in a state which had had such legis­
lation to do something about it, didn't it?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

It absoultely did and —
To desegregate, wasn't it, an affirm­

ative duty?
MR, GREER:

But the duty is to provide a system

in which no one Is denied access to a school because of
race or color.

That 1 would submit to you is different

from an affirmative duty to create sane balance of races
throughout the school system.
QUESTION: What has happened to that good old
phrase "root and branch"?
MR. GREER:
is still in the law.
QUESTION:
MR, GREER:

The good old phrase "root and branch”
But in the Green case —
I hop© so,
In the Green case, the words "root

and branch" refer to the noun "discrimination."

It is

discrimination that is to be taken out of these school,
root and branch.
QUESTION:

But wouldn’t you admit that there

was discrimination in '72?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

Didn’t you admit that?

No, I have not admitted that.
I thought you admitted that in ’72,

18

75 percent of the Negroes were assigned to all-Negro
schools.
MR. GREER:

I do not call that discriminations,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

Well, you do admit that fact though?
That fact I admit, yes.

What I am

saying is that in an equity case — and maybe I can high­
light this best by addressing your attention to the aiaieus
brief filed by the ACHJ on behalf of the respondents,
where they urge the Court to in essence overrule Dayton I
and hold that the Fourteenth Amendment provides an affirma­
tive duty to create as much dispersion of the races as
possible.

I don’t think the Fourteenth Amendment as you

have defined it means that.

And in order to get where

the respondents want to get in the case, they have to
have you rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

That would mean overruling in part

the Swann case, would it not?
MR, QREER:
QUESTION:
don’t say that.

Indeed it would, Your Honor.
You keep saying — the respondents

You are talking about the ACLU.

Are

you putting that burden on the respondents?
MR, QREER:

Well, 1 think, to be blunt about

it, if the respondents want to get where they want to end
up in this case, they have got to adopt the reasoning of

19
the ACLU, because the only way you can get there Is to
rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment in that manner and to
hold specifically that the imposition of a neighborhood
school system on a situation where you have racially im­
balanced populations, without any segregative intent or
purpose on the part of the board at all* violates the
Constitution, and I don9t think you should reach that
conclusion because I think that is an incorrect con­
stitutional conclusion.
Thank you.

Mr. Caldwell.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. CALDWELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CALDWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
My ease, as apparent, is quite different from
the case that has been presented by the petitioners. Their
case is that racial discrimination has been the rare ex­
ception in the operation of the Dayton public schools.
My case is that it 1ms been the rule.
Their case in effect contends that deliberate
segregation has affected the schools on only a few occa­
sions at random and with very limited and precisely defin­
able impact.

But our case and the undeniable facts show

that school segregation in Dayton not only was predictable,

20

it was predicted by purposeful design and operation for a
period of at least sixty years, from 1912 to 1972, the
board operated a systematic program of racial segregation
that was circumscribed by neither geography nor adminis­
trative function.

Throughout this time, the board oper­

ated a cover dual school system.
QUESTION:

What were the District Court’s find­

ings on the 1972 situation again?

What did the District

Court find about the condition in 1972?
MR. CALDWELL:

The District Court found no ex­

tant condition requiring a constitutional remedy.
QUESTION:

They found no violation.

MR, CALDWELL:

They found no — well, it found

violations.
QUESTION:

Mo violation as of the time of the

lawsuit, dldn *t it ?
MR, CALDWELL:

Well, I am not exactly sure —

I assume that is correct, since it dismissed the complaint.
But it seemed to acknowledge that there were constitutional
violations that had existed in the past —
QUESTION:

Had been.

MR, CALDWELL:

— but none had any continuing

effect at the time of the lawsuit.
QUESTION:

At the time of the lawsuit --

MR. CALDWELL:

That is the finding of the District

21
Court.
QUESTION:

It would seem to me it would have to

have found that to have dismissed the complaint.
MR, CALDWELL:

I think that is at least implicit

if not explicit in the District Court's opinion.

The

facts, however, are that between 1912 and the time of
Brown — and by talking about the pre-Brown period, X
don't want to exclude the post-Brown period which I will
turn to momentarily.

This program of systematic segrega­

tion consisted of the conversion of three elementary schools
Into black only schools, and by that X mean schools to
which only black people were assigned and to which only
black teachers were assigned.
QUESTION:

And that had taken place when?

MR. CALDWELL:

Between 1912 and 1954 and during

that period —
QUESTION:

During that whole period?

MR* CALDWELL:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry?

Sometime between that some 42 years?

MR. CALDWELL:

These schools were converted as

the need arose to segregate and confine the black popula­
tion, as the black population grew.

So it began in 1912

with the segregated class at the backdoor of an otherwise
white school.

That moved eventually into a larger out­

building in back of this white school, the black population

22
continued to grot*» the school was converted into an allblack school over the summer.

The white students and

teachers were transferred out to other schools.
QUESTION;

And this process —

MR, CALDWE1LL:
QUESTION;

And this process was repeated ~

— went on over a 42-year period?

MR. CALDWELL:

That’s correct9 and these schools

were full-blown state imposed segregated schools at the
time of Brown.
QUESTION;

Not the State of Ohio technically,

because the State of Ohio since the l880fs had prohibited
precisely what you tell us Dayton was doing.
MR, CALDWELL:

I cannot agree with that, Your

Honor,
QUESTION:

They did not —

MR. CALDWELL:

n

The State of Ohio acting through

its agency with jurisdiction over this problem, imposed —
QUESTION:

Acting through its legislature,

MR. CALDWELL:
but it —

Not acting through its legislature,

S
QUESTION;:

Hadn’t it been the 3aw of Ohio that

these things were illegal that you have told us about?
MR. CALDWELL:
QUESTION:

That’s e orrect.

That is what I thought.

MR. CALDWELL:

That’s correct.

They also prior

23
to Brovm built another all-black school which made four
all-black elementary schools.

In 1933 , they constructed

Paul Lawrence Dunbar High School, opened It as a blacks
only high school operating on a city-wide basis to which
blacks from all over the system were assigned.
assigned an all-black faculty.

It was

This school continued in

raw form as it was created in 1933 until 1962.

The board''
S

from 1912 to 1951 operated pursuant to a system-wide policy
of never allowing black teachers to have any contact with
white pupils*
QUESTION;

Well, all of these things that you
,/

have told us happened in spades in that region of the
country where the legislatures required them to happen.
Does that mean that school districts in those areas of
the country are always going to be tainted by their
historic illegal unconstitutional action?
MR. CALDWELL?

Your Honor, it will be until

they have done something to undo this horrendous wrong
that they have committed.

And what I am trying to convince

you is that by the time of Brown, the Dayton school
authorities had essentially accomplished the same results
that North Carolina accomplished in Chariot be-Mecklenburg
and that thereafter they should have been under the same
constitutional duty.
QUESTION:

Mr. Caldwell, you say what you are

2H
trying to convince us of, but ordinarily we don't sit as
finders of fact.
MR. CALDWELL:

I should have said what the

Court of Appeals found was that they had committed that
same wrong and were therefore under the same constitutional
duty.
QUESTION:

Of course, there we come back to what

has been mentioned before, it Is not normally the function
of a reviewing court to make findings of fact, is it?
MR. CALDWELL:
in the Columbus ease.

I was curious about that question
In our case, any time a Court of

Appeals finds a finding of fact of the District Court
clearly erroneous, it is necessarily asserting another
fact and It is finding another fact.
QUESTION:

Or it is sending the case back with ''

some instructions, is that not more often the fact?
MR. CALDWELL:

As 1 read the clearly erroneous

decisions, they almost always — if.the appellate court
arrives at a judgment unless there is some other issue
aside from the clearly erroneous findings of fact at issue,
but if an appellate court decides —
QUESTION:

The cases that you are talking about

are usually eases where you have a single issue or two
issues, not a whole mass of issues, isn't that so?
MR. CALDWELL:

Oh, I don’t think so.

I think

the leading clearly erroneous ease, United States v. U.S.
Gypsum Company., is a ease in which the facts were enormously complex and the court dealt with those at some length.
I may be mistaken about my recollection of the facts in
that case, but quite a few of the cases in this Court have
involved antitrust litigation —
QUESTION:

You are not speaking of the more

recent —
MR. CALDWELL:

Not the more recent U.S. v. U.S.

Gypson, no, the 19^8 decision.
QUESTION:

Mr. Caldwell, in your submission I

believe — and I am confident that it is the case in your
colleague's submission in the Columbus case — the school
board after a finding of a violation is entitled to shoulder
the burden of proof that the violation did not cause an*
Incremental segregative effect so as to be system-wide,
is that correct?
MR. CALDWELL:

That's correct, they have the

option of carrying that burden.
QUESTION:

Since Judge Reuben found there was

no violation here, presumably there was never any hearing
at all on remedy, so shouldn't the Court of Appeals at
the very least, even under its own hypothesis, have sent
the case back to the District Court so that the school
board could have been heard on the issue of remedy?

26
MR. CALDWELL:

Ordinarily that would be the case

in the situation where a school board was making the asser­
tion that it wanted to meet its burden of showing that the
system-wide violation had less impact than intended.

But

in this instance the board of education has not contended
ever that if we are right about the nature of the viola­
tion that there is anything wrong with this remedy that
we have and so ~
QUESTION:

1 understood your opponent to argue

at some length that the violations, whatever violations
existed were not system-wide.
MR. CALDWELL:

That is his contention, Your

Honor, but he has not made the next argument by conceding
that if he is wrong about that, he nevertheless thinks
f

that the remedy, Is too broad.
s>

QUESTION:

You regard those as two separate

stages of .4he proceeding?
MR, CALDWELL:

Well, I think it depends on the

circumstances of eaeh ease perhaps, whether you have a
separate inquiry.

Ordinarily you have a separate — in

school segregation litigation where the question of
i

violation is at issue, you have a bifurcated approach,
one dealing with the violation and one dealing with the
remedy,
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn’t you as school board

27
counsel In this case, after succeeding getting the complaint
dismissed in the District Court on the violation issue,
have been somewhat surprised by a Court of Appeals de­
cision which not only said there was a violation and we
now impose this remedy?
MR. CALDWELL:

Not in this ease* Your Honor, be­

cause in the Court of Appeals we challenged the board to
point out any part of the remedy which it thought was ex­
cessive if we vxere right about the violation.

There is

nothing that has prohibited the board from assuming arguendo
that there has been system-wide violation and saying
nevertheless we think th© remedy goes too far even as

they contend the violation ~

But isn’t that something for the

District Court in the first instance?
MR, CALDWELL:

Not if the school board is not

making a contention, and if the school board were to make
that contention or had made it in the Court of Appeals, I
would agree that the ordinary course would be to send it
back for a hearing on that issue.

But they have not to

this day to my knowledge, Mr. Justice, made a contention
about the nsed to have a remedy hearing on this particular
issue.
Our assertion is, and we have asserted in our
brief and I do not understand them to disagree, that if

28

we were right about the violation and its Impact, they are
satisfied with the remedy.
By 195*} — I should mention a couple of other
important policies which were followed throughout the
system.

By 195*}, 5*} percent of all black students and

all black teachers were confined to these deliberately
created black only schools.

Throughout this same period

of time between 1912 and 195*}, whenever black students
at tended school in predominantly white senoois, they were
subjected to all forms of within school discriminations
segregated swimming pools, segregated locker rooms, the
athletic programs were segregated until X9*}3, black
children were required to sit in the back of the class,
uenied the opportunity to participate in white activities
such as being an angel in the school play, and black
orphanage children from across town were bused in to
these black only schools, past nearby white schools to
which they could have attended.

And the board operated

one-race classrooms in explicitly designated one-race
public housing projects.
As I say, 5*} percent of the black children at
the time of Brown were in these black only schools and
three-fourths of all children were in schools that were
virtually one race.

Except for the absence of the written

state law permitting this result, the Dayton system was

29
basically the same system or the same as the systems that
were before the court in Brown, and it was basically the
same system that existed in Charlotte.

The minor s3ight

factual distinction is that there was a minimal level of
tolerance of racial mixing.
QUESTION:

Wasn’t that true of almost every big

city in th© United States — New York or Chicago or —

It Is certainly possible. / The

question is how did it get that way, and I don’t know that
there has been litigation on that issue.
QUESTION:

No, I don’t either.

It has Just occurred to me that what

you were telling us was probably characteristic of every

MR. CALDWELL:

Well, if it is, Your Honor, it

is a sad state of affairs because these people did the
same thing that the Charlotfce-Mecklenberg Board of
Education did.
QUESTION:

Perhaps so.

The Issue in this case

is whether or not there was a constitutional violation at

— and maintained throughout that

The board never met its affirmative duty to undo

that deliberate segregation.

Instead, it deliberately

advantaged itself of the very substantial root system
and trunk of segregation that were firmly in place in
195^, so that as of the time of trial the schools in the
Dayton System were racially segregated because of system-

31
wide policies and practices of deliberate racial segrega­
tion.

Thase policies and practices included the continued

racial assignment of faculty to existing schools as well
as to new classroom space according to the racial compo­
sition of the students, pursuant to a policy adopted in
1951 which was explicitly racist.

It said that we will

introduce Negro teachers into white schools when the white
communities are willing to accept them, and we will not
introduce whit® teachers Into Negro schools against their
will.
QUESTION:

And when did this happen?

MR. CALDWELL:

This policy was in effect from

1951 until 19^9 when H.E.W. Intervened pursuant to Title
VI of the 196^ Civil Rights Act.
QUESTION:

So that situation didn’t Itself exist

apart from the vestages of its effects, but it didn't
itself exist at th® time the lawsuit was brought?
MR. CALDWELL:

But its vestages were rampant.

The board engaged in a massive pattern of school construc­
tion on a racially segregated basis, and the Court of
Appeals concluded that two things during the period be­
tween 1954 and the time of trial —
QUESTION:

Mr. Caldwell, you say the board

engaged in a massive program of school construction on a
segregated basis.

Supposing the board has to build a

32
school out in a newly developed area the population of
which is 99 percent white and it picks a site out there
and it knows that 99 percent of the people going to school
are white, would you describe that as part of that kind of
a program?
MR. CALDWELL:

If it does that in a. vacuums,

Your Honors it is one thing , but in this case they did it
in the contest of a system-wide program of segregation
which had fimneled black people to part of the system and
preserved the rest of the system for whites and they can­
not be forgiven for that s any more than CharlotteMeeklenberg can be forgiven for that for the period
between 195^ —
QUESTION:

Well, where is that finding?

Judge

Reuben obviously did not so find.
MR. CALDWELL:

No, the Court of Appeals made

that finding with respect to a number of the board’s

\

■

practices and they found that the entire board was oper­
ating a system-wide program of ssgregatl.bHu
QUESTION:

Well, where is the finding as to

funneling by school construction?
MR, CALDWELL:

Well, X will give you one ex­

ample of such a finding, the Dunbar High School, which

•

was operated from 1933 to 1962, the Court of Appeals found
that through discriminatory practices in other parts of

33
the system that the board by counseling, by discriminating
against black students that went to predominantly white
schools and in effect forced blacks to go to this systemwide black only high school.

Any person who would observe

that situation would make a residential choice on the
basis of the board's policy or would likely make a resi­
dential choice on the basis of the board’s segregation
policy.

A white family seeking a residence in Dayton

certainly would not move to the Dunbar High School area
v

where their children couldn’t even be educated because
they couldn’t have any contact with black teachers, at
the same time black families were not inclined to move
or could not have been inclined to move into the white
parts of town where they would have been subjected to
humiliating discrimination and never had contact with
black adults.
I want to make one other point.
;

By 1969„

■ j

considerable pressures were being brought to bear on
•

;

.

the operation of the — on the segregated operation of
the Dayton public schools and on the sehool authorities
to do something about that condition,

H.E.W., as I said,

intervened in 1969 and found that the board had a racially
motivated faculty assignment policy and worked out a twoyear remedy for that.

The state board of Ohio investigated

the sehool system, the State Board of Education, and found

that the board was under a moral and a constitutional duty
to take remedial action.

The board appointed a citizens

committee which made similar findings.

The board

president admitted before the citizens committee that the
board Itself had been guilty of past de jure acts of
segregation, intentional acts of segregation, I should
say.

Then the board itself considered that question In

December of 1971 and adopted resolutions admitting that
its past practiced had caused the current condition of
segregation and directing the superintendent to develop
a remedy.
All of these findings would be entitled to
probative weight in any circumstance, given the normal
reluctance of school officials to admit past wrong-doing.
In this case they are compelling because the facts cannot
be read to the
contrary.
:

That remedial action, of course,

was rescinded th© following month when a new board of
education took over.
We think, if I may sum up by comparing Swann
to this case, that the — in Swann, the court recognized
that the delay between 195“4 and 1971 had compounded the
problem, that dilatory tactics of school authorities had
compounded the problem, that the court's failure to
refine guidelines had compounded the problem, that the
massive urban growth that had occurred through this period

35
compounded the problem.

Yet the court recognised that

the school officials persisted in discriminatory conduct,
had played a substantial role in this pattern of develop­
ment, and those findings are fully applicable to Dayton
and that remedy should be fully applicable.

The Judgment

below should be affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr.

Caldwell.
Mr. Days.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. DAYS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and ma it please

the Court:

J.__ _

-

—........-

1 would like to respond to a question that Mr.
Justice Stewart put to ray colleague.

Essentially, does

a school board ever get out from under the responsibility
for certain, segregatory practices?

I think the key

response to that question, talking about essentially the
attenuation theory, and there is indeed a possibility for
a school board to show that past segregative acts have not
created or contributed to current segregated conditions,
and I think that is a

burden that is open to every school

board to try to discharge.
QUESTION:

Well, it would be a very difficult

36
burden» it seems to me, to carry.

We all know, even

amateur historians, that the present is a product of the
past and I am sure nobody could argue the proposition that
all sorts of conditions in the present have their roots
back in th© 19th if not the 18th Gentury.

Isn't that an

almost impossible burden that you have described?
MR. DAYS:

I don't believe it is impossible.

It has to be evaluated on a ease by case basis, but 1
think It is open to the school board to make that showing.
That is what this Court said.

And I think it also said

it in Swann, that there was a possibility available to a
board to make this type of showing.
There is one other point that I wanted to make
and that is to mak© clear that there is no suggestion on
the part of th© government that Dayton be overruled.

We

think that Dayton I can be read consistently with the
earlier decisions of this Court, even where there is a
showing of a system-wide violation.

The inquiry never­

theless must be made as to what are the cumulative or the
' •

••• };

:

V _.

incremental — strike cumulative — Incremental segregative
effects of that violation.
But the Columbus and Dayton School Boards
challenge here th® validity of principles and procedures
that are not th® product of some theoretical exercise.
They com© instead from our judicial experience and hundreds

37
of eases with this Court's opinion In Swann, the flinty
and tractable realities of how to make desegregation work
in the face of deliberate resistance and changes since
195^ in the structure and patterns of communities, the
growth of student population, movement of families and
other changes.
QUESTION;

You speak of hundreds of cases, I

would like to ask you about on® that you set forth at
some length in your brief on page 6H in which the Court
of Appeals relied on a case called Oliver v. Michigan
Stato Board of"'-Education, and your quota at that page
of your brief is from Oliver.

It says, ”A presumption of

segregative purpose arises when plaintiffs establish that
the natural, probable, and foreseeable result of the
public officials® action or inaction was an increase or
perpetuation of public school segregation.

The presumption

becomes proof unless defendants affirmatively establish
their action or inaction was a consistent and resolute
application of racially neutral policies.”

Do you think

that is consistent i^ith Dayton, with Arlington Heights
or with Washington v. Davis?
MR. DAYS:

1 do, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because

1 read that language in context, in the context of showing
not just one such act creating a segregative effect but a
pattern of that kind of in the context of other showings

38
of segregative intent.

In other words, it is some evi­

dence, this pattern is some evidence that there is a
consitutional violation, but it necessary, as Arlington
Heights points out, to look at the totality of the circum­
stances, to look at the history, to look at contemporane­
ous practices, to look at alternatives that were available
to the board.
QUESTION:

But Oliver says it — it Just doesn’t

say it permits an Inference, it says it is a presumption
that becomes proof unless it is rebutted.
MR. DAYS:

Well, I am not here to defend the

Sixth Circuit, Mr. Justice Rehnqulst.

It is my under: - -j

'standing of the law that the principle is one of looking
at the totality of the circumstances and where there is

of a violation. This is not unusual. This Court said in

:
‘
'
Washington v. Davis that certain patterns, if they are

shown to be very consistent, can ultimately serve as the
basis for a determination of a violation, not simply an
inference of that violation.
The principles that have been articulated by

39
this Court in its opinions are pjrounded on considerations
of fairness and policy and designed to provide practical
and effective means of eliminating long-standing and per­
vasive segregation of the public schools in violation of
the Fourteenth Amendment.
¥© know, moreover, that these principles have
worked well in practice, based upon a review of the re­
ported decisions and Department of Justic files, we have
determined that approximately 200 school districts with a
combined enrollment of mors than five million students
are presently operating under court-ordered desegregation
plans that are preraised in whole or in part on the remedial
principles of Swarm and Keyes.

In addition, the department-

40
AFTERNOON SESSION — 1:00 O'CLOCK

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
continue.

Mr. Dayss you may

You have about four minutes left.
MR. DAYS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

At the noon hour9 I was addressing my comments
to the practical and effective nature of the principles
and. procedures that have grown out of these decisions of
the Supreme Court, of this Court with respect to school
desegregation.

Not only ar© they practical and effective

in theory9 they are in fact practical and working in
actuality,
W© looked at reported, decisions in the files of
the Justice Department and , as I indicateds we found that
there are 200 school districts, involving over five
million children who ar© going to desegregated schools
based in whole or in part on the remedial principles of
'v..

I'

Swarm and Keyes.
In addition, we have consulted with the Depart­
ment of Health, Education, and Welfare and have learned
from that department that it has 200 additional school
districts that ar® desegregated as a result of the guidance
provided by Swann and Keyes.

In fact, one reason why the

Dayton Board of Education may not be contesting the remedy
in the case is because the plan there is working well. It
is in its third year, not of course meaning to say that

the board gives up its right to make the arguments before
this Court as to whether the correct principles were ap­
plied.
But what the records here reflect is that the
familiar pattern of intentional segregative acts by school
officials affecting substantial portions of those school
districts by techniques such as segregated faculty assign­
ments, constructions, additions, sitings, and closings of
schools, with segregative consequences where there were
integrative alternatives available.
QUESTION;

What you say there, I take it, Mr.

Days, is that the segregated faculty which terminated,
when, back in ’69?
MR. DAYS;

Well, in Columbus not until

and

in Dayton in the 1971-72 school year.
QUESTION;

I suppose there are still possibly

some students in the schools who went to school under a
segregated faculty system?
MR. DAYS;

I think that is correct. Your Honor.

QUESTION 1

But not very many.

MR. DAYS;

Well, it has been eight or nine years

since that was decided, so one would assume that there are
students who started in elementary school who are still
in the system.
QUESTION;

The kindergarteners would still be

42

In the upper echelon of high school now somewhere.
MR. DAYS:

That's eorreet.

But we have seen

also In these records departures from so-called neighbor­
hood school concepts when it served to keep blacks in
majority black schools or would allow whites to avoid
going to schools that were substantially black.

We see

in these records overnight conversions of schools from
white to black;, that is one day the faculty was white and
the student body was partially black9 the next day,
speaking figuratively, the'faculty was all black because
there was some Indication that that school had a substan­
tial black student body..
We think that these records make unavoidable
the conclusion that the principles^fumciated in Brown,
Green, Swahn and Keyes are as applicable to Columbus and

Kent County, Virginia in 1968, Charlotte, North Carolina

on the faculty segregation, about '67?
ME. DAYS:

It was prior to Swann.

QUESTION:

A couple of years prior.

MR. DAYS:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Then If they remedied that between

'69 and '71, the schools were not called upon until the

were they?
MR. DAYS:

Well, I think they were.

really got to the —
QUESTION:

They were In the abstract but the

Court didn’t declare that it was a constitutional requirement until the Montgomery ease, did they?
MR. DAYS:

Mo, I believe it was a requirement

long before Montgomery.

Montgomery was really concerned

with what type of remedy on® could enter with respect to
faculty segregation, but I think It was clear far before
that that school boards had the responsibility not to
assign faculty members based upon their race.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Days.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. GREER, ESQ.,
\

\

i:

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL
MR. GREER:

Both of my opponents have suggested

that the Dayton School Board is not contesting a remedy in
this case and I think It behooves me to correct that state­
ment before you.

As we have Indicated in the opening

argument, Dayton is both a violation and a remedy case.
The query is, is the plan that has been imposed
in Dayton working well with the student population that

has shrunk from 52,000 to 36*000 since this suit was filed.
I would -QUESTION:

Tell me if you happen to agree with

the findings of a system-wide violation in the case* which
I know you don't.

Do you separately attack the remedy?

MR. GREER:

Indeed I do, Your Honor, and that

is what —
QUESTION:

Well, was that among the questions

in the petition?
MR. GREER:

It is, Your Hpfior,
at pages ^5 to
v

50 of our brief, I have expressed the factual side of the
case that relates to that remedy finding.

Either I have

expressed it so well that nobody has deemed it possible
to answer it or I have expressed it so poorly that nobody
has deemed It necessary to answer it, but I would like
to think that the former is true.
it seems to me that if the remedial goal is th
restoration of plaintiffs to substantially the position
they would have occupied in the absence of alleged viola­
tions, it is appropriate to examine how that position is
defined by the evidence.

And it is very sharply defined

by the evidence in this case, and I go through that evi­
dence in quite a bit of detail on pages t5 to 50 of the
brief, and it is essentially taking block census data
and taking maps and going year by year through it, and

45
here Is what you find.
There is factual evidence in the record in this
case that the center of the black population in Dayton
was established not by the school board but by the 1913
Dayton Flood* that the black population following that
flood located in an area on the west side of Dayton and
that the population expanded from that central location
t'tfith the passage of time.

Indeed* in the period from

551, '52* up to the time of this suit* the black student
population of the Dayton school system increased from 19
percent to almost 45 percent of the students in the
school system.
The. evidence in this case is that the attendance
boundaries in the Dayton school system have been unchanged
for some twenty-five years.

There hasn't been any manipu­

lation* any gerrymandering* any changes of any of these
school boundaries.

And the evidence demonstrates graphic-

ally through maps and through census data that as the
black population expanded from the center that it estab­
lished after the 1913 flood* the schools in the Dayton
system changed from tfhite to racially mixed to black,
reflecting the residential population change.

And it can

be demonstrated year by year in a ring of schools that
follows that census population, that there was no change
wrought in these attendance boundaries or any other manner

by the board to contain or to change that natural movement
of population.
Indeed, the case Is a textbook because it shows
the exception that proves the rule.

After that flood, in

addition to the center of the black Dayton population
being on the west side, there was a small residential area
on the east side of Dayton which is a primarily whit©
residential area9 along Springfield Street, in my home
town.

And that small area of black families attended the

schools that were geographically close to them, Washington
Elementary School, and that situation has not changed over
the years.

And you can look at the figures for a period

of twenty years and you will find that the elementary
school that serves that black neighborhood has consistently
remained between 1*} and 23 percent black simply because It,
like eyery other school in this system, has done nothing
but reflect the residential racial populations served.
You could talk about ~

QUESTION:

Mr. Greer, to what extent — one of

our problems in, the case, as you know, is the Court of
Appeals making findings.

Now are you asking us to make

findings or the District Court to make findings covering
this area of the ease?
MB. GREER:

I hat© to get into the posture of

making a factual argument to the Supreme Court of the

47
United States and I don't think I need to make that argumenfc.

All I am trying to do is to answer to the factual

arguments that have been made here today* is to express
what the evidence really was and that there was a strong
basis for the District Court's findings that should have
been upheld.

There Is no clear —

QUESTION:

Did the District Court make findings

on this very point3 that the effect would have been the
Siam© regardless of the violation, if any?
MR. GREER:

Right, it is phrased in the findings

of fact in terms of taking practice by practice in these
isolated unconstitutional practices that may have
historically and expressly finding that there was no incre­
mental segregative effect from those practices at the time
this suit was filed.

So this is part of the findings in

the case, and I would simply submit to you that upon both
the remedy and on the violation side of this case, the
Dayton School Board was .justified in securing a dismissal
of the complaint.
QUESTION:

four position is, really, regardless

of which party has the burden of proof on this Issue, you
have met it?
MR. GREER:

You can put the burden of proof on

me, that is fine, although I don't think legally that Is
correct.

But if you should choose to do so, I have met

it.

The facts are there.

The incremental segregative

effect here is sero and the appropriate remedy is a dis­
missal of the complaint.
Again, 1 could answer every factual argument
that has been presented with regard to black orphans being
transported across town.

In fact* from 1950 on. they were

all placed in white schools* but I don't think I need to
go into each of those detail factual arguments before this
Court.

It is all in the brief.

It is in the judge's

findings of fact* and there is evidence to support it all.
At its most fundamental level, this litigation
it seems to me poses a choice, a choice between case by
case application of equitable principles and judicial
legislation of racial balance through the use of a loaded
game board of artificial presumptions.

The case also pre­

sents a focus on the proper role of Intermediate appellato
courts in this federal system.
I would submit that in an attempt to justify a
predetermined result, the Sixth Circuit has rewritten the
legal standards that have been espoused and presented by
this Court and it has rewritten the factual evidence that
was presented to the trial court.

That is not the proper

role of an intermediate appellate court.
If the standards established by this Court and
the facts presented by the trial court are put together,

49
they compel the following answers to the particular ques­
tions that are posed by this case:

Was the Dayton School

System at the time suit was filed segregated by reasons of
acts of the Dayton School Board?

No.

Would the distribu­

tion of the student population in the Dayton system have
been different at the time of suit if the school board
had not taken the actions which the plaintiffs have chal­
lenged?

No.
That ends the case.

We are addressing a court

of equity and I think equitable principles and the facts
here compels those answers to those questions.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon., at 1:15 o'clock p.m.s the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
