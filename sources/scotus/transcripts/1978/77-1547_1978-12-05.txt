And we do not believe our position in this

As the briefs of

the parties make

clear,

the

federal

rules of criminal procedure do not resolve the questions

They do not designate which court should

in particular proceedings.

It is petitioner's

contention that the Arizona civil

in the best position

to make a searching examination of particularised need.

And

they urge that because the Arizona court — - and they urge
that the Arizona court had

In our brief we discuss what we believe to be the
