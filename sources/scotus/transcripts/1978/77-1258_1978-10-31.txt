MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Service Corporation, et al, and Marquette National Bank of
Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corporation,

et al.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. ALLYN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITION32R
MR. ALLYN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court in council:
I do speak on behalf of the interests of the State
of Minnesota in this

Ccise.

This is an appeal from the Minnesota

Supreme Court.
And the dispute is over whether a Nebraska national
bank has to abide by the Minnesota usury laws when it charges
interest to Minnesota residents for a bank credit card program
conducted in Minnesota? or whether, as it claims, it can
import the Nebraska usury law into Minnesota in order to
charge six percent more interest than the other banks that
are doing business in Minnesota, including other national
banks.
Now, Bankamericard and Master Charge credit card
programs have been marketed in Minnesota, as indeed, throughout
the country, for many years.

It's a fair statement to say

that thousands of Minnesotans rely on these cards daily
to purchase goods and services, indeed, to get cash advances.

4
ikw 4

A few years ago Minnesota

passed a specific statute

to govern these kinds of transactions»

It's known as the

open end loan arrangement law -- we call it the Bank Credit Caret
Act.

But essentially it says this?
That a state or national bank or a savings hank can

issue credit to a consumer, permit them to pay it back in a
flexible way, permit them t© use the money in a flexible way;
and indeed, the card holder himself decides when ha's going
to obtain the credit and when he6s going to pay it offt
In Minnesota the statute says the annual interest
that may be charged is 12 percent.

In addition there are some

compounding limitations.
Finally, there is a $15 fee permitted,up to $15
permitted for the privilege of using the card.
It’s important to note that without exception the
national banks and the state bank of Minnesota which have
issued and use these cards have abided by the Minnesota law
from its inception in 1976.
Late in 1975, the First National Bank of Omaha,
Nebraska, came to Minnesota, registered a wholly owned
subsidiary, which is managed by one of its vice presidents,
with our secretary of state, and appointed a person suitable
to receive process in Minnesota, and embarked upon a systematic
solicitation of Minnesota residents, using the telephone and
the

mails

5

kw 5

In addition, merchants and banks willing to handle
these transactions were enlisted.
Now the problem is that the First National Bank of
Omaha, Nebraska, wants to charge 18 percent on the unpaid
balance.

In addition, they have some compounding techniques,

if you'd call them that, which exceed those which are
permitted by our state statute.
This issue in this case, then, is whether or not
they can do that, or whether they have to abide by our statute.
And let me just say by way of introduction that it seems
without dispute that a state's right to protect its citizens
from usury has been a tradition in American since its founding.
We've had a law in Minnesota on usury since terri­
torial days.

And this tradition was in the mind of Congress,

we argue, in 1864 when it passed the National Banking Act,
which is what you're examining here.
And that tradition was codified in this respect:
A number of people wanted to adopt a uniform national interest
rate, but it was rejected.

It was felt that each state should

be entitled to regulate its interest, each state to protect
its own citizens.
On the other hand, they wanted to make clear that
their own creation, the national banks, or new creation, the
revised national banks, I should say, would not be unfairly
treated by these state laws.

6
kw 6

So they provided that in charging interest national
banks would be governed by the laws of the state where
they're located„
There's no question that Congress intended for the
states to continue to set the interest rate* and that the
national banks would be bound by it.
And just one quick quote — I won't try to belabor
it.

But the Congressman from California said:

"What is the

consistency or propriety of having two rates of interest
established by law in the same community?

What is the

benefit of having two systems of usury in the same state?"
Of course* they rejected that notion of two systems.
All right* what is now codified as section 85* which
is in issue here, simply says a national bank can charge for a
loan what they can charge for a loan is that rate allowed by
the laws in the state where it's located.

\

First of Omaha claims, our main office is in Omaha*
Nebraska; ws can charge the Nebraska rate and go anywhere in
the country and charge that rate because we're located in
Nebraska.
Now* we urge that Congress never intended to let
this provision be used to export interest rates into other
states.

We believe that Congress intended to preserve to each

state the right to regulate interest rates.
Now* there's no question that the language on its

7
w 7

face raises the possibility they assert here? we don't deny
that»

But we urge you to consider Congress' purpose and

intent when they adopted section 85.

And we've supplied in

our briefs statements similar to the one I9ve read which
indicates what that intent is»
It seems clear to ue that at the time that
Congress adopted section 85, it only contemplated banks being
in one place.

Banks didn't travel the paths of interstate

commerce the way they do

today.

If a person, even from another state, wanted a loan,
they showed up at the bank and posted their security or note,
and bundles of notes were handled across the counter, and away
they went.
Now a couple of courts — the decisions which are
cited in our brief — have agreed that at section 85, is
silent when a bank goes somewhere else than the state where it's
located, and that as a result, when they go elsewhere, they're
governed

by whatever laws are in force in that state.
I think there's an alternative argument which is just

as sound, and which I would urge here today as well.

And that

is that "located" can mean more than just where the home office
is, where that building is.
If you'll look at the intention of Congress, and
you apply it to the transaction here, it seems to me that there
is no question that when a bank comes into Minnesota, does a

8
dkw

a

substantial solicitation, profits by this commerce in our
state, maintains a corporation licenses to do business in
Minnesota, or a foreign corporation,
QUESTIONS

With respect to that, counsel, would

Minnesota's purposes be served if the court had simply
enjoined the subsidiary in Minnesota from carrying on this
kind of conduct?
MR. ALLYNs
would have done.

We're not sure what the national bank

It seems that it may well have.

And the

reason for that is that the subsidiary was the one, according
to the stipulated record, which made agreements with the local
banks which would handle the paper coming from the merchants.
And secondly, the subsidiary was the one that was
going to collect the delinquent accounts? and as a matter of
fact, keep the interest.
QUESTIONs

But the Supreme Court of Minnesota felt

not even a subsidiary could be enjoined?
MR. ALLYN;
correct, your Honor.

The Supreme Court of Minnesota —> that's
They felt that because of a prior

interpretation in the Eighth Circuit, that they were bound
by it.
But Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if you read our court's
opinion, you'll find it's one of the most reluctant conclusions
QUESTION?
MR. ALLYNs

They weren't happy, obviously.
Okay.

And the reason they weren't

9

dkw 9

happy is because of the anomalous result.

And that is that

one state could anywhere — a bank from one state could go
anyifhere in the country and beat out the competition there
because they're bringing a different interest rate with them.
QUESTION s

I would have thought that you would get

more business if you charged lower rates.
MR. ALLYNs

Okay, the problem that comes up here,

Mr. Chief Justice, is, they advertise their card ■—
QUESTIONS

-- in terms of competition.

Perhaps it's

just the use of that word that —
MR. ALLYNs

Well, it made a difference here, and here's

how it happened.
They claimed that their card was free.
card in Minnesota could claim that.

No other

And the reason they could

claim their card was free was that they weren't charging this
privilege fee.

And the reason they could do that is because

they were charging a higher amount of interest.
So no one else could make this wonderful claim
that their card was free.
the street.

And pity the consumer walking down

All these banks had signs up that said,

BanlcAmericard.

Many banks sell it.

It's not an exclusive

license;.
And let's face it, one of the intents behind usury
law, one of the ideas is, that the public can't protect itself
wholly.

It doesn't shop as wisely as it might.

10

*cw 10

So we're saying — the legislature is saying, as an
exercise of our police power, we've got to look
citizens to a limited extent.

out for the

And that limited extent is

setting an outside limit on how much interest can be charged.
So I agree that shopping around is certainly part and
parcel of our economy, but some protections apparently have
been added.
The important thing that we wanted to emphasize
to you today, at least speaking for the state of Minnesota,
is, that we feel very strongly that if section 85 is interpreted
in the way they want, it's going to displace our own ability
to protect our citizen from usury.
And I think there are some analogous cases, although
they're not based on section 85.

But those cases — the

Alden's cases; there are three of then now out of the circuits,
all of them holding that a mail order company in Chicago
which ships things off to, say, a state like in Pennsylvania,
must not charge more interest than the law in Pennsylvania,
that it's not an undue burden on interstate commerce, and it's
not an interference with their ability to make a profit in
that state.
QUESTION:

Well, those are really minimum contact

cases, aren’t they?

Here you have a subsidiary that actually

took out papers in Minnesota.
MR. ALLYNA

%

That's true, your Honor.

I frankly

11
kw 11

think our case is a little stronger.
But one of the points I wanted to make to you today
is that they're looking for approval of a radical departure
from the custom in the trad® today,

our knowledge there

are only two national banks that are going elsewhere and
claiming that they can take their higher rate with them.
And that leads me to one of two last points I want
to make before giving way to other counsel, and that is, there8s
been a request made in one of the amicuses that you make a
prospective ruling here.
Personally, the state does no object to that because
we5re just seeking an injunction.

But I'd like to point out

that our evidence shows that, first of all, there aren't
that many other banks that are doing it.

Almost every state

in the country today has a bank credit card statute which
sets an interest rate in that state.
Secondly, First Omaha came into Minnesota and kept
doing what they did in the face of our new statute, without,
ever challenging it, without ever bringing on a declaratory
judgment, without ever even asking the Commissioner of Banking
for an opinion.
So it isn’t as if they weren't on notice that there
might be a problem.

But they decided to do commerce in our

state and take profit from our state without abiding
by our law.

12
kw 12

One last point then
QUESTION! e

General Allyn, why do you think the

Minnesota court was so deferential to the Eighth Circuit?
That hasn5t been historically true,, and I wondered why they
were persuaded here by it.
MR. ALLYN:

Your Honor, I think the Justices9 opinion

fait that because of the procedural way the case actually came
up to the Minnesota court with the First National Bank itself -of Omaha -- not being there, that -- they felt that in effect
their decision was going to affect that bank? there9s nc
question about that.
QUESTION:

And all the parties were Eighth Circuit

people,, were they not?
MR. ALLYN:

Yes, your HOnor,

Yes, your Honor.

That they shouldn't try and implement a different
rule of law than what they felt was the superior court's law.
QUESTION:

Didn't they feel that — the Eighth Circuit

felt and didn't this court feel it was bound
in a way?

The Tiffany case?
MR. ALLYN:

Tiffany.

by Tiffany

Actually, no — well, they mentioned

I think what they felt they were bound by —
QUESTION:

Well, you would suggest we overrule

Tiffany.
MR. ALLYN:
your Honor.

I don't suggest you overrule Tiffany,

I suggest that what they want you to do is

13
expand Tiffany way beyond what the Supreme Court in 1874
decided.

What they — what I think the Minnesota court felt bound

by was the Fi3her case in the Eighth Circuit.
QUESTION:

And —

What did the — didn't the Fisher -— wasn't,

the Fisher case# didn't it purport to follow Tiffany?
MR. ALLYN:

Your Honor# it was in dictu.

Actually#

they started right out by saying section 85 is clear? they're
located in Nebraska.

It's a Nebraska transaction there in

Iowa,
But there's no question they discussed Tiffany and
said# if the most favored lender factor# and it had to be
used here because Iowa had a higher rate# you know# they could
charge the higher rate in Iowa.
I don't deny you that Tiffany is a vary important
part of the case, and co-counsel is going to talk about the
most favored lender doctrine.

But you don't have to overrule

it here.
The most favored lender doctrine was meant to
protect banks from discrimination against state banks in their
same location.
Minnesota.

We don't have a discriminatory statute in

All banks and lenders in the bank credit card

business# indeed# any kind of credit card business# can
charge the same interest rate in Minnesota: 12 percent.
If it's a Diner's — or a local department store? if it's
an installment loan from the bank? they're all 12 percent.

14
kw 14

So the point I wanted to make to you* Your Honor*
is that — while some people don't like Tiffany,we don't
want you to feel you have to overturn it to get to where we
want to go today.
QUESTION’:

Except there's talk about a different

rate of interest for small loan companies.
MR. ALLYN:

Okay.

Mr. Stewart — Justice Stewart, if

I may address that real quickly.
QUESTION:

Minnesota sti!3 has its small Loan act,

does it not?
MR. ALLYN:
QUESTION:

It does, Your Honor.
Which allows 36 percent in the aggregate

or something in that neighborhood?
MR, ALLYN:

33 for a loan up to $300; 18 percent

for $300 to $600; and 15 percent up to $1,200 was theoutside
limit.
The important thing to note here is that it’s a
closed end transaction.

It doesn't permit any compounding.

And it has other limitations that they don't even begin to
comply with here.
Now, they

use that argument, Mr. Justice Stewart, to

say that they can go through and grab off that interest rate
there and use it on these credit card transactions.

While,

darn it all, the small loan act was designed to make credit
available to people who couldn't frankly get credit cards.

15

3-5

QUESTIONS

Well, under Tiffany, what if in the home

state of a bank, the state has a special — a general rule,
the interest rate at 18 percent, and then they set a special
rate for state banks, 12 percent.
Well, now, under Tiffany, the national bank isn't
bound by that, is it?
MR. ALLYN:

Under Tiffany, they could charge the

higher percent.
QUESTION i

MR. ALLYN:

And we're not contesting that.

We just

Very well.

doctrine here in Minnesota by applying this 18 percent which
we found over here in the small loan act.
QUESTION:
MR. ALLYN:

Did the Minnesota court pass on it?
I don't believe the Minnesota court

decided that it had to.

As a matter of fact, I'm sure it didn't.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Troyer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN TROYER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. TROYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The — I would like to respond to a couple of the
questions that were asked here.
In terms of the competitive disadvantage which the
Marquette National Bank, finds itself, it charges a 12 percent
rate and a $15 membership fee —■ or did, until it sold its
program.
The Omaha bank comes in here with an 18 percent rate.
What is the competitive disadvantage to The Marquette Bank,
as distinguished from the disadvantage to the Minnesota
consumer?
The disadvantage to the Marquette Bank is, number
one, obviously, it cannot chax-ge an 18 percent rate; it
cannot get the profit yield of an 18 percent rate.
But more precisely, a bank which can charge a higher
rate of interest has tremendous flexibility and advantage in
terms of advertising, in terms of soliciting the consumer; if
it is entitled to a greater yield, it can afford to spend the
time, money and effort in order to attract the consumers in
the state of Minnesota, and to draw them off of, for instance,
Marquette's program.

17
Forthermore, the Omaha bank has a competitive
advantage at the 18 percent rate level because the Omaha bank
in Omaha is entitled to charge its finance charge of 1-1/2
percent per month on the previous balance of a customer's
account, whereas in Minnesota, the rule provided by our statute
is, it must charge that rate on the average daily balance of
the customer’s account.
Now, by charging a finance charge of, say, 1 percent
on the average balance of the account as distinguished from
the previous balance, the yield is greater using the previous
balance method.
So that’s just another example of how the Omaha bank
and its subsidiary are privileged.
Secondly, we are not, as Mr, Allyn suggested, urging
that you overrule Tiffany.

MR. TROYER:

'w 18

Circuit extended Tiffany beyond — well, what I think ought to
happen here.
It seems to me that you cannot apply, or should not
apply, Tiffany in an interstate transaction.
85 does not, or should not, permit that.

That section

The very language of

section 85 does not permit that.
If you look at the clauses and try to construe them
together, the first clause which permits a bank located in
Nebraska, for instance, to charge the highest rate of interest
to general lenders in the state of Nebraska.
If you look at that first clause —
QUESTION:

Do you think the section would prevent

Minnesota from passing a statute that would require Iowa
banks to charge a higher rate of interest than Minnesota banks?
Or

a lower rate than Minnesota banks?
MR. TROYER:

Would you give me that again, please?

I didn’t follow it.
QUESTION:

Well, the sectioji — you say the section

just doesn't apply at all to an interstate transaction, is that
it?
MR. TROYER:

Well, my — Marquette's position is

that section 85 is totally silent on the issue of what rates
of interest ----- wait a minute, on the rates of interest which
may be charged in interstate loan transactions.
It is perfectly clear in the intrastate

setting,

19

kw 19

but not in the interstate»
QUESTION:

So it doesn't apply at all to an interstate

transaction?
f

MR. TROYER:
QUESTION:

That's correct,, your HOnor.
So that as far as that section is concerned,

Minnesota could require an Iowa bank to charge a higher rate or
a lower rate than —MR. TROYER:

Oh, no, Minnesota couldn't require an

Iowa bank in Iowa, obviously —
QUESTION:
MR. TROYER:

No, I mean in Minnesota.
When that Iowa bank , comes into

Minnesota, when it solicits Minnesota residents, when it —
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but could it require the

bank to charge a higher rate, or a lower rate, or either one,
than a Minnesota bank, when it's doing business in Minnesota?
MR. TROYER:

All it could require under the most

favored lender doctrine in Tiffany is that —
QUESTION:

What about the section?

You say it doesn't

apply at all to protect the Minnesota banks?
MR. TROYER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
And so that so far as that section is

concerned, Minnesota could require the Iowa bank doing
business in Minnesota to charge either a higher rate or a
lower rate than Minnesota banks?
MR. TROYER:

The Iowa bank, when it comes into

20

w 20

Minnesota, has privileges of Minnesota national banks; so that
Minnesota, if it passes a law permitting Minnesota banks to
charge 12 percent or 18 percent, certainly the Iowa bank could
take advantage of it.
QUESTION:

By virtue of what section?

MR. TROYER:
QUESTION:

By virtue of section 85.
So it does apply to an interstate

transaction?
MR. TROYER:
QUESTION:

No, it applies to intrastate transactions?
Mr. Troyer, I've missed something.

Why does it just go after them for usury?
MR. TROYER:

Well, the Marquette National Bank is

given special standing under the Minnesota statute as sort of a
private attorney general to enforce the Minnesota statute.
The Marquette Bank, in and of itself, has no standing
to assert a claim of usury here against the Omaha bank or the
Omaha subsidiary.

That cause of action belongs to consumers,

or belongs to the state of Minnesota acting on behalf of
consumers in that state.
QUESTION:

Well, normally, every other state I know

when somebody charges usurious interest, they manage to get
indicted?
MR. TROYER:

Well, we would have loved — Marquette

would have loved -- to be able to bring a cause of action
against that Omaha bank for usury, but we simply didn't think

21

w 21

we had standing.
QUESTION?

I didn't say the bank brought it.

The

individual people — why don't you tell them that they get all
their money back plus, they’re very glad to join in a suit,
aren't they?
MR. TROYERs

The state of Minnesota, as a matter

of fact, in its intervention — intervening complaint has
asserted a cause of action against the Omaha subsidiary for
that purpose, and is asking if the Minnesota Supreme Court
is reversed here, is asking to recover — or for an adjustment
in their interest rate charged to consumers.
So that’s a part of the state of Minnesota's cause
of action.
QUESTION:

Because I have a great problem with a

cause of action that says that when pciople charge extra high
prices, it interferes with competition, and the free market
place, and all of those other type phrases.
MR. TROYER: In response to that, your Honor, all I
can say is that Marquette bank has been disadvantaged; there
has been a drawing off of customers of the Marquette National
Bank.

And the statute was passed both for the benefit of

state banks in Minnesota and national banks located in
Minnesota, and for Minnesota consumers.
And we are — we have standing under that statute,
and have asserted our claim here.

Because we have been injured,

22
22

We are injured when a Nebraska bank comes in here
and offers its card free to Minnesota residents in order to
take -- it can afford to offer the card free when you have,
when its permitted to charge an 18 percent rate.
If it had to operate at a 12 percent rate* it
wouldn’t be offering that card»
QUESTION?

Well* suppose gasoline companies start

to selling gas for $3 a gallan; would the other companies

MR» TROYER:
QUESTION:
MR. TROYER:
QUESTION:

I —
If it were limited to money?
I assume not»
Well, I understood your friend, your

colleague, to say that the come-on was that the Omaha bank
could advertise no membership fee initially, and that would
get the customers into the house»

And then afterwards they

would find they were paying 18 percent instead of 12.
MR. TROYER:
QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor.
That's how he explained my confusion about

competitive advantage, at least to me.
MR. TROYER:

Back to my point, if you look at the —

the Seventh Circuit here has taken the position it8s the
plain language of the statute.

It talks in the first clause

of 12 U.S.C. 85 — that's on page 23 of my — of our brief -it talks about the fact that the words are, any loan.

And

23
that means any loan made in the state of Nebraska; any loan
made in the state of Minnesota,
We don't believe that you can read the statute that
way.
Given the second clause of 12 U,S,C, 85, that
interpretation won't wash.

The interpretation here that a

Nebraska bank can charge the highest rate of interest provided
in either state.
The clauses taken as a whole are clearly referring
to any loans raade in the state where the national bank is
located.

You've got to construe both clauses together.
If the words, any loan, in the first clause referred

to loans made across state lines, then the second clause,
refers to the rate of interest permitted state banks located
in the foreign state, rather than state banks located in the
home state.
It's clear that the second clause refers to the
rate of interest permitted state banks located in the home
state, and the home state only.
The construction given here by the Seventh Circuit
and by the state of

Minnesota in section 85 conflicts with

the doctrine of competitive equality which has been — ever
since Tiffany — has been part and parcel of section 85.
The purpose of Congress in adopting section 85
was to maintain and secure competitive equality between

24
national banks and state banks in the interest rates they
could charge»
If you look at the Senate debates, in the Congressional
Globe, which we cite in our briefs, it's clear that there is
not any debate by the Senators as to this point, as to what
interest

rate could be charged by a national bank crossing

state lines.
Certainly, they would have debated that point,
because you had a state bank lobby on one hand in 1864, and
you had a national bank lobby on the other hand.

And they

were very concerned, each separate party, about protecting
their interests.
And if there was any thought at that time of adopting
section 85 that a national bank of Nebraska was going to be
able to coma into the state of Minnesota and charge Nebraska
rates, the Senators would have raised it, and we could see that
in the debates.
You don't see that in the debates.

Adoption of the

Seventh Circuit decision, adoption of the Minnesota position —
the Minnesota Supreme Court's position — means destruction
hare of the doctrine of competitive equality between state
and national banks in interest rates.
As Mr. Allyn pointed out, there is a very delicate
balance between national banks and state banks in terms of
competition between them.

If you're going to allow a

25

Nebraska bank to come in here to the state of Minnesota and
by offering the card free draw off, and in effect, to ruin
Marquette's bank card program, what's to stop it from going to
some other state and doing the same thing?
No local, national, or state bank will be safe
from the predatory practices, then, of out of state national
banks located in the state permitting the higher interest
rate.
Again, I emphasize that Marquette and the state of
Minnesota take the position that section 85 of the National
Bank Act is simply silent on the issue of what interest rates
may be charged by a national bank when it crosses state lines
and transacts business in a foreign state.
QUESTION:

Well, this was more than just a national

bank crossing state lines, though.

It actually incorporated

a subsidiary in Minnesota.
MR. TROYER:

That's correct, for purposes of

conducting business in Minnesota.

We take the position that

section 85 is silent; that ordinary conflicts — or conflicts
of law rules apply here.

r

For instance, in the first clause of section 85,
when you read the words, the laws — any national banking
association may charge on any loan or discount made at
interest

allowed by the laws of the state.
That means the state's conflicts of law rules as well.

26

kw 26

Take for instance a state lender in Nebraska who chooses to
come into the state of Minnesota.

Based on Nebraska's conflict

of laws rule, that state bank in Nebraska would, presumably,
given the strong public policy

statements in the Minnesota

statute, have to comply with the Minnesota Credit Card Act.
QUESTION;

What if someone from Worthington,

Minnesota, went down to Omaha and borrowed from the First
National.

Would the First National be entitled to charge him

a Nebraska rate?
MR. TROYERs

If that consumer goes to Omaha,

Nebraska, and our act specifically provides for that, in
subdivision eight, I believe

it was, when that Minnesota

consumer goes to Nebraska and obtains a loan from — or obtains
a card from a Nebraska bank, shows up at the premises of the
Omaha bank, certainly in that situation.
But that's not what happened here.

The Omaha bank

was in Minnesota, through its operating subsidiary, systematically
and continuously soliciting Minnesota residents for the
purposes of enrolling them in that Nebraska bank's program.
QUESTION:

Mr. Troyer, the amicus brief filed here

by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors makes, alternatively
at least, a different argument as you know; well, it makes
three.
First of all, it asks the Court to overrule Tiffany.
And then it says that even if Tiffany is not overruled, there

27

are at least two alternative grounds on which your position
can be

should be — vindicated.
First, assuming that a bank can be only located in

one place, and hare the bank is located in Nebraska, that
85 is simply inapplicable to business it does anywhere else
except where it is located.

And that's, as I understand it,

been your argument.
But secondly, it says, particularly in light now of
Citizens and Southern National Bank v. Bougas, that a bank
can be located in more than one place and that this bank was,
is located in Nebraska, and when it moved into your state
of Minnesota, it's also located there.

And therefore, by the

very terms of 85, for its Minnesota business, it is governed
by your law, since Minnesota is where it's located for the
purpose of that business.
You haven81 mentioned that argument.

Do you disavow

it?
MR. TRQYERs

We don't disagree with that position,

and that is really the position of the state of Minnesota,
that for intrastate -QUESTION?
MR. TROYER?

I didn't hear you make it.
— that for intrastate — intrastate

loan transactions, a national bank is located in Nebraska.
QUESTION:

The argument is only really made in the -•

so far as I’ve heard today — in the

brief of this -- in this

28

28

amicus brief to which I referred.
I haven’t heard it been made orally.
MR. TROYER:
QUESTION:

Well, let me make it orally.
Well, you don’t have to.

I’ve just stated

it.
But do you disavow that argument?
MR. TROYER:

No, no.

I can accept that argument as

an alternative ground for holding in favor of Marquette and
the state of Minnesota.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time has expired now,

Mr. Troyer.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.,
*

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The only substantive question in this case is actually
whether section 85 of the National Bank Act applies to
interstate loan transactions.
I think the answer to that as a legal matter is quite
clears It absolutely and clearly applies, I think beyond any
doubt.
But so much of this discussion today has been
essentially legislative, cast somewhat as legal argument.

But

29

kw 29

it9 s really legislative., asking this Court to change the
reading that section 85 has had for over one hundred years,
in order to protect Minnesota8s public policy, that I think
I ought to spend a moment characterizing this case, before
going directly into the

understanding section 85.

And that is this:
rates.

Nebraska is not exporting interest

I think it is more accurate to say that Minnesota

is exporting its law, to a Nebraska bank.
A Minnesota resident who wants a line of credit from
a Nebraska bank, we are told by Nebraska — by Minnesota,
I'm sorry — may drive or fly to Omaha, gat the Omaha credit
card, find bring it back and use it in Minnesota or any other
state in the union? but he may not engage in that same
transaction by mail.
And that's all that this case comes down to,
because what happens here is, a Minnesota resident is told,
made aware by a service corporation which extends no credit
to anybody, that those credit cards are available in Omaha.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest--telling us that all of

these transactions are made in this way, Mr. Moore?
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, I am saying that

anybody who wants a First National Bank of Omaha credit
card sends an application to Omaha, Nebraska.
is passed upon in Omaha, Nebraska.
in Omaha, Nebraska.

The application

The credit is extended

And the debt is repaid in Omaha, Nebraska.

30

And what we're being told today is, that that would
be all right if the Minneapolis resident drove to

Omaha

and got his credit card, but not if he sent a letter or an
application asking for his credit card.
QUESTION s

What do you think the act of extending

credit is in the credit card thing?

It’s when —- if the

customer goes to a restaurant and uses his credit card,, and
signs the slip? it's when the bank pays the —
MR. BORK:

When the bank pays the restaurant, Mr.

Justice White.
QUESTION:
MR. BORK;

And that happens in Omaha, you say?
Oh, yes, that happens in Omaha.

Now

it’s conceivable that if a Minneapolis resident went to New
York and used his credit card in a hotel in New York, New
York might say, ah ha, its public policy should govern that
transaction? and then we would have a three-way fight.
QUESTIONs

Well, why can’t Minnesota say if

an

Omaha bank wants to have one of its customers use his credit
card in Minnesota, that Minnesota can control the terms of
that?
MR. BORK;
QUESTION;
MR. BORK;

You mean a different kind of a statute?
Yes.
That could happen, and I suppose if every

state in the union said that every use of a credit card in our
state to purchase something is governed by our usury laws,

31
I think the credit card business would cease to exist.
Because everytime somebody crossed the country,
the credit card companies would have to compute interest for
every different state and see where every transaction was —
QUESTION:

Well, what has Minnesota said that's

different from that?
MR. BORK:

Well, Minnesota says that if our

customers — if you ask our customers to write to you to
get a credit card approved in Omaha, you have to comply with
Minnesota interest rates even though the entire making of the
loan, the entire extension of the credit, everything about that
transaction,

is centered in Omaha? and even though — and I

should stress this — that credit card will be used —
QUESTION:
MR. BORK:

Anywhere.
anywhere in the country, in many

nations abroad.
QUESTION:

If the business is so heavily centered

in Omaha, why did they incorporate a subsidiary in Minnesota?
MR. BORK:

To make phone calls, to make it known

that if you send an application to the First National

Bank

in Omaha, we will consider it and perhaps send you a credit
card.
QUESTION:

Do you think —do you think the Minnesota

court could have enjoined that?
MR. BORK:

I do not think so, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

32

32

Because that would be to apply Minnesota law through its
subsidiary to a Nebraska banking transaction.
Now it could enjoin if it was a deceptive practice
or something of that sort.

We're not talking about that.

We*re talking about, send a letter to us in Nebraska, and
we*11 consider extending you credit.
That is exactly the same kind cf transaction -QUESTIONs

Well, it could be that if some resident

of Minnesota insists on paying more than the going rate of
interest and prefers to pay 18 percent Instead of the going
rats, then the only way to do it is either to mail it Iowa
or go to this office in —
MR. 'BOFK:

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I should say

that the Omaha plan has a lot of advantages that the Minnealpolis
plan does not.
If you are a prompt payer, if you engage in a
transaction, go te a restaurant on September 15, get billed
on October 1, pay before October 25, you will pay no interest
rate

to the Omaha National Bank, but the other -—
QUESTION;
MR. 'BORK;

Provided it8s mailed on time?
Yes„

But the other plan, Mr. Justice

Marshall, charges you a $10 or a $15 charge, whether or not
you are a prompt payer.
So that it is to the advantage of prompt payers to
use the Omaha card.

Minnesota?

QUESTION:

Radio, television?

MR. BORK:

'

No, well, it6s been mostly by mail or

telephone in making applications available in that sense.
Now I should say one word about this enormous
competitive disadvantage which the Marquette National Bank
thinks it lives under.
And that competitive disadvantage turns out to be,
really entirely, that the Omaha bank, through its agent,

34

dkw 34

can advertise a free credit card.
The Marquette bank could have advertised equally
a 33 percent lower interest rate.

This entire case* this

entire attempt, to change the structure of the national
banking system, turns out to be a fight over alternative
advertising techniques.
I really think Marquette bank would have done better
to take their case to an advertising agency instead of a law
firm0
But that's what it comes down to.

And I would like

if I may to return to the law of the case, which has in the
presentation been somewhat slighted, I think.
i

And I think it is clear that section 85 of the
National Bank Act applies to interstate transactions; and for
over IOC years the banking industry has assumed that, and has
had every reason to think so because of this Court's decision
in the Tiffany case and because of the ~
QUESTION;

Bo you say that Tiffany is a holding to that

effect?
MR. BQRK:

No, sir; I do not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

But if you take a look at Tiffany and then at the clear
language of section 85, which appears on page 14 of
respondent's brief, the blue brief, the statute

provides in

pertinent part, the national bank ~ freely translating it
until 'I get to the right word, pertinent word — the national

35

kw 35

bank may take interest charged on any loan or discount made,
and that includes every loan or discount made by a national
bank.

So that the plain

text meaning of section 85 is that

if a loan or a discount is made by a national bank, section
85 covers it.
Now I would think that it would take a rather strong,
a rather compelling showing, in the light of the Tiffany
case over 100 years ago, and a consistent line of cases following
Tiffany; in the light of the clear wording of section 85; and
in the light of the understood practice of the financial
industry in this area ~ and I want to stress that, because the
financial industry has built up around the settled expectation
2

that 85 applies.
And we are now talking about an industry affected
by this case —■
QUESTION:

Incidentally, Mr. Bork, section 30 dealt

with in Tiffany, read almost exactly in hyperbata didn°t it?
MR. BORK:

Yes, it did, Mr. Justice Brennan.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Well, that's okay if one proceeds on the

assumption — I mean your argument follows, if one proceeds
on the assumption that the bank is located in Nebraska and
only in Nebraska.
But what if the bank is located in Minnesota?

36

MR. BORK:

Well, of course, at the time

the 1864

act was written, branch banking was absolutely prohibited.
So that one would have to —

QUESTION:

Yes, but how about the Bougas case.

MR. BORK:

About the Bougas case.

Citizens 6

Southern against Bougas said, I think, entirely on reasoning
thatl think applies to this case, that there is no particular
reai3on to confine the word, located, no that a bank cannot be

sued at its branches.
Because all of the policy reasons against ~ for
requiring the word, located, t© mean

sue the bank —■

QUESTION:

In one, single place.

MR. BORK a

— have<now changed so that those same

reasons permit suit at the branch banks.
In this case, those policy reasons, as I hope to show,
press in overwhelmingly in th& opposite direction.

And the

reason I say that is that a really enormously complex — and
I should say, enormously, highly regulated, at state and
federal levels — industry is involved here, built around —

37'
kw 37

in part, built around the principle that section 35 applies to
thi s.
And you now have an industry which has — governed
by this case alone — which annually does hundreds of billions,
perhaps trillions of dollars, in credit transactions.
not a credit card case.

This is

This is a cane that applies to all

interstate loans, because section 85 is not a credit card
statute.
And if section 85 has no application to interstate
transactions, it has no application to any interstate
transactions.
For example, interstate mortgage money, which is a very
big industry, x^ould suddenly be thrown into chaos by a decision
that the state ~ where the bank is located no longer governs
the interst rate.
Interstate auto loans, which are very common, have been
governed by section 85.
This is not a credit card case.

This is an interstate

lending case.
QUESTION;

You9re saying then that the banks have

construed section 85 this way for so long, we should construe
“j

it

that way.

MR. BORK:

QUESTION ;

By all means —

MR. BORK;

I was about, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, to

suggest that there was some reason for the banks to have felt
this way.

Given the Tiffany case, given the plain language,

any laon made by a national bank, which is in section 85; and
than given the practice which has grown up and which was
unchallenged until recently.
The form books in which these loans are made, the
available form books, all specify, the law of the state* of the
bank an the law providing the interest rate.
It's just been understood in this industry.
QUESTION;

Well, do you really think form books

should be an important part of our decisional apparatus?
MR. BORK;

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I was just

suggesting that the form books are merely a reflection of an
understanding that this industry has been built upon.
And if X had no other argument, even if it were
unreasonable for the

sanking industry to have construed

section 85 the way they did, I would stand here before you
=

and argue that that unreasonable construction, having gone on
so long, ought to be adhered to, because you havenot the
information before you to know what new statute to legislate
ihirdugli initafcpretafeioh of debbibh 851

39

And indeed you have not the options under section
85 to .'Legislate wisely in this field.
For example, the kind of legislative problems we’re
being given here by the state of Minnesota and the Marquette
National Bank for consideration,

perhaps the best national

rule — I don't know; perhaps the best national rule

would

be a single credit card rate for all credit cards, legislated
federally.
That might be the way to handle this.

That is not

an option that is avaialable to this Court under any
conceivable reading of section 85.
QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Bark, would you agree that when

Minnesota or any other state places a statutory limit on
interest rates, and declares that certain penalties for
anything beyond that is usury, that what the state is doing
is expressing an important social policy to protects its
citizens?
In general, would you agree that that's the purpose?

MR. BORK; I doubt that you can gamble by mail, but
once it is — what is being said here is that a Minneapolis

resident may not write to an out of state bank for a line of
credit which he intends to use all over the country because
Minnesota follows him, Minnesota brands the resident, so that
Minnesota law goes everywhere he gees.

Well, Minnesota maybe would put it in a

little different light.

is not credit extended in Minnesota,

whether or not the card is gotten by mail or by a personal

MR. BORK:

No, the credit is extended when the Omaha

bank pays the merchant,, whether that merchant is in Minnesota
or Iowa or New York or Los Angeles or Bangkok.
QUESTION:

All right.

i

MR. BORK:

That credit is extended at that point.

It is extended at Omaha, Nebraska.
QUESTION:

And it is repaid —

Well, if that's true, if it's Omaha

rather than Minnesota, isn't it equally Omaha, whether or not
the credit card is obtained by mail as opposed to be a

MR. BORK:

That was my point, Mr. Justice Stevens,

that Minnesota was saying, we don't attempt to follow our
residents if they drive across the state line, but if they
write across the state line, our law goes with them.

Yes, but under your view — if you're

correct, as I understand you — neither transaction would be

statute, if your presentation is correct?
MR. BORK:

No, I would much prefer, if I may, to rely

on the federal statute, Mr. Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Well, I just don't — there's something --

I haven't quite followed your argument.
MR. BORK:

Well, I was trying — my point about that—

I
j've spent much, much to much time developing it, I'm afraid —
is that we were started with a characterization of this case
which was intended to make what

happened sound very unfair,

as if Nebraska was invading Minnesota with an interest rate.
And I'm just trying to point out that what happens here
is that somebody goes to Omaha, or writes to Omaha, and every
step in the transaction takes place in Omaha; and that's
all I wanted to — I merely wanted to place the case in some
perspective.
QUESTION:

Do you or do you not contend that there's

a difference between a transaction by mail and a transaction
by personal visit?
MR. BORK:

I think there is no difference whatsoever.

47
kw 47

Tha Minnesota statute, I am told by counsel, makes one.

But

I really — my argument really is that section 85 governs.
*

I have already made the point, I think, that its plain
language governs any text.
Now the question is — there; are only two arguments
made against that.

And each of them is completely specious.

The first one is that there is a policy of competitive
equality which has to be read into section 85.

And it's specious

because that policy derives from later enactments which have
nothing to do with section 85.
And if you look at the Marquette bank's brief, Marquette
bank itself, on page 13 as I recall, agreed that a state bank —
pardon me, a national bank in a state gets the rate that the
general lender gets, or the rate that the state bank gets,
whichever is higher.
That's not a policy of equality.

That, on the face

of the statute, is a policy of favorite lender.
Now, that is exactly what Tiffany held, and Tiffany
was right.
Now it is said, but since then we had a policy of
competitive equality, which somehow argued backwards to
I

overcome the language of 85.
In fact, that .is not true.

If you will look at

section 85, you will see that in 1933 it was amendment to
give national banks, but not state banks, freedom from state

48

dkw 48

regulation by giving national banks the option of charging
one percent above the federal discount rate, which option

^

was not extended to state banks.
And what that means is, at the beginning, competitive
equality as to discount, as to intere531 rate, was never
intended by Congress; competitive equality as to interest
rates is not intended by Congress today.
And Ivthink I've sufficiently pointed out that
there is no competitive inequality in fact in this case,
because it’s a dispute over advertising techniques.

They

have a technique they could use as well as the one we have
used.
The other argument is that Congress simply could
not have intended section 85 to apply to an interstate
transaction, because there was no interstate lending back
in those days, or nothing to speak of,
That assertion is incredible.

Before the American

revolution, there was intercolonial lending.

In their

book, The Stamp Act Crisis, Helen and Edmund Morgan point
out that the Stamp Act crisis caused by the closing of the
colonial courts, and that states — or colonies, rather —
)

such as Connecticut were delighted because that meant that
out of colony creditors couldn't enforce their judgments in
Connecticut.
Before the American revolution, there was an

49

dkw 49

international trading.
trading.

London factors financed our tobacco

George Washington himself was engaged in that kind

of financing.
When we come to the constitution itself, it's
clear that interstate lending follows interstate commerce,
bill of exchange and so forth which are mentioned specifically
in section 85.
And one of the reasons for holding a constitutional
convention was to deal with control at the federal level over
interstate commerce.

And it is quite clear, I think, that in

the writing of the constitution, the framers were contemplating
interstate lending, because they took care to make it a federal
power to write a uniform bankruptcy law, obviously to prevent
discrimination against out of state creditors by states.
Wow if we come to the period after the revolution,
I refer simply to the brief filed by the First National Bank
of Chicago, which gives examples of bank interstate lending
in the 1830s.

I would refer the Court also to Carl Swisher's

history of this court in the Tawney

years, the Holmes

history of this court, in which he points out that in 1839,
this court was deciding the right of corporations to deal in
bills of exchange in states other than where they were
incorporated.
And he points out that President Van Buren had to
address Congress in a special session about the problem

posed by bills of exchange, to transfer capital from one
region of the country to another.
If that Congress didn't understand that interstate
lending was going on all around it, it must have been
incredibly obtuse or else it was hermetically sealed.

And it

was neither.
And once we assume that Congress understood that
interstate lending existed around it in 1864, then we cannot
assume that Congress, for the only tine in history, reversed
the constitutional patter and chose to legislate entirely
as to intrastate transactions, and leave to the states
control of interstate transactions.
That turns the thing entirely upside down.

So I

think there is no -- I would close with the remark that this
industry would be thrown into chaos if we have now •— not just
the credit card industry; the entire industry — if we have
now to take the 48 million credit cardholders out there, follow
their residences as they move around the country, recompute
interest, recalculate the way it's done, follow
all the jurisdictions.

I don't

the leiws of

know whether this kind of

business, or the interstate mortgage business, or the
automobile loan business, is going to be doable.
There are enormous costs involved that simply aren't
in this record that ought to be taken into account by
Congress.

Congress has amended this section 85 many times.

51

dkw 51

Congress has taken up the credit card issue in terms of how
you compute these rates»

In 1977 a bill was introduced on that.

It

is not

as if Congress was inactive.
And we have a trillion — many trillions of dollars interstate loan business, which simply ought not to be thrown
into confusion by overturning a law that has been so clear,
and been regarded so clear, and been interpreted so
consistently for over 100 years.
And for that reason, because of the law, because

financial industry that has been built around it, we ask that
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota be affirmed.
QUESTION:

If it should be found that your client

bank, the Omaha bank, had located itself in Minnesota '.-by
opening up this wholly owned subsidiary agency, then 85
clearly would apply, wouldn't it, to -— and make the Minnesota
rate of interest applicable to business done by the whollyowned subsidiary with Minnesota residents.
MR. BORK:

Well, I suppose — let me repeat, Mr.

Justice Stewart, that I think the policy reasons that led to
)

the expansion of the word, located, in Bougas, lead precisely
to the confinement of the word located here, because you're
going to upset a major industry without knowing exactly what
is happening, without knowing the result of the ruling, without

52
w 52

having the option of the information before you.
So Bougas, I think reads against it»

^

But if one said that a bank is located wherever it
does

has some activity -QUESTION:

No, no, not wherever it has some activity,,

not where it does business by mail, but wherever it opens a
wholly-owned subsidiary for this business.
After all, the Minnesota court, while the Minnesota
statute says the defendant has to be a bank, the Minnesota
court in this case apparently held that this subsidiary was a
gank within the meaning of that statute.
MR. BORK:

!>

That's a point that has to be raised

yet below, because I think we have problems under section 86,
the venue provision, by treating First of Omaha as a bank.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BORK:

But that wasn't decided below, or argued.

QUESTION:

Right at the tail end of your brief.

MR. BORK:

But the problem would not be solved by

expanding the word, located, when you incorporate a
subsidiary to do this.

Because obviously, a subsidiary doesn't

have to be incorporated to do this.
)

I think the only way the word located could be
enlarged in order to take care of that — to say that any time
a bank does business across a state line, it is located across
the state line.

QUESTION;

Well* you wouldn’t need to go that far.

MR. BQRK:

But I don’t think* Mr. Justice Stewart,

with respect, if the policy would be consistent unless you did
go that; far.

And if you did go that far, or ever this far,

you would have really enormous impact upon a —
QUESTION;

But what if a subsidiary sold credit cards,

actually issued credit cards?
MR. BQRK:

I don’t think the selling of credit cards

would, in fact, be the making of a locm.
QUESTION;

You think if — before Minnesota law

would govern at all, or the bank could be said to be located
in Minnesota, is if it were extending credit in Minnesota.
MR. BORK:

If it engaged in the act of making a loan

in Minnesota, which would require a branch, it would be then
located in Minnesota.
But it is not located, within the meaning of section
85, and cannot be, because it’s not permitted by law to branch
into Minnesota.
But all banks do business across state lines.

And

all banks will be affected by a ruling that — of this sort.
QUESTION;

Mr. Berk, your argument about the

trillions of loans that would be affected by this case prompts
me to ask why the banking industry apparently has taken so
little interest in this case.

MR. BORK:

Well, there's one by the consumer bank

Yes.

Which is an association of banks.

I cannot answer you as to why other banks have

QUESTION:

Every major bank in the United States

solicits loans in virtually every state, as well as foreign

And I understand your argument to be that this

MR. BORK:

Well, since section 85 is certainly not

credit card, but a loan statute —QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. BORK:

— it would certainly control all those

things.
I cannot offer you an explanation, Mr. Justice
Powell.
