PROCEEDINGS
MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning In No, 1690, Parham against

several

minors.
Mr. Lackey, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R, DOUGLAS LACKEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LACKEY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The cause of this case is here for reargument,
and I realize that the Court Is familiar with this case.
With the Court's pemission, I would like to begin by simply
setting the issues before the Court and proceeding directly
to my argument.
At issue in this litigation, of course, is the
constitutionality of the Georgia statute which recognizes
the rights of parents of mentally ill children to make application for those children to stats mental health facilities».
The statute was attacked on essentially two grounds.
The Appellees argued that children have a constitutionally
protected liberty interest and that this statute which
authorizes their hospitalization without prior notice dnd
hearing deprives them of that liberty interest without due
process of li-:w,

4
Second# fche Appellees- argued and the district court
found that children who are mentally 111 and who receive
treatment from the state have a constitutional right to
receive treatment for their mental illness in only that
treatment setting which is most appropriate to their condifcion.
Turning to the first issue# the foremost and thresh­
old question which should have been addressed in the district
court and wasn't# was an examination of th® interests sought
to be protected to see whether in fact it has a constitutional
dimension., That is# do children have a constitutional right
to challenge the medically indicated decisions of their
parents?
What the district court did was simply look and
Bee that parents make decisions for their children and as a
result of this decision-making process that oftlmes the
child is subjected to potentially grievous injury# hare
hospitalization# as fche district court characterized it.
And what he said was -- what the district court said was#
that because of the injury here this parental decision-making
process can only be done in a constitutionally permissible
fashion.
We submit that this is the point where fche

district

court made fche error upon which its entire opinion is predi­
cated,

It is our position that; a proper analysis of this case

5
should have begun with the pa rent-guardian and child relation­
ship,

It is our position that based on this Court's previous

decisions, as well as the history of our Western civilization,
that we have decided -- and by ''we" I mean society and not
the state — that we have decided that there are certain
decisions that children cannot make for themselves, that
there are certain decisions that an adult has to mak® for a
child.

And among these decisions are medically indicated

decisions, with vary few exceptions»

That is, it is our

position that in our society parents, with the advice of a
physician, routinely make decisions which range from whether
a child is to have a tonsillectomy to decisions which have
life and death consequences for the child.
One example, which 1 like to use, is the situation
where the parent is faced with the child who has a heart
defect, a young child, and a doctor says,"Of course, the
child can live without an operation.
invalid for his or her entire life,

The child will be an
I can operate.

If the

operation is successful the child will lead a normal life.
If tha operation is not successful the child will die."
That kind of decision, that kind of decision»
making process occurs in the family routinely, yet no one,
has ever suggested that that kind of a decision, which clearly
could have the consequences which are much more adverse than
what we have here — no one has ever suggested successfully

6
except in a few recent district court decisions# that that
kind of a decision-making process is required to be subjected
to an adversarial proceeding# such as what was mandated here
by this district court decision»
QUESTION:
Mr. Lackey.

I want to be sure I understand you#

Are you suggesting that the Constitution of the

United States would prohibit the intervention by the state
in that sort of situation?
MR. LACKEY:

I believe# sir# that it would prohibit

it to the extent that the state did not have a compelling
state interest to interfere -QUESTION:

The Constitution would absolutely pro­

hibit the intervention by the state in that sort of a situ­
ation?
MR, LACKEY:
QUESTION:

Yes# sir# after the showing of a -Or are you suggesting that it is con­

stitutionally permissible for a state to leave that decision
to the parent?
aren’t they?

Those are txvo quite different propositions#
Which are you suggesting?

MR,. LACKEY:

It would be our position that it would

not be constitutionally permissible for the state to inter­
fere with the family in that situation# absent the demonstra­
tion of a compelling state -QUESTION:

You don’t need to go nearly that far

in arguing this case# do you?

7
QUESTION:

You need stand on only the second leg,

d on'fc you ?
MR. LACKEY:

I certainly could,

I believe I could.

Perhaps I don't understand your question,
QUESTION:

I think it is rather important, because

those are two quite different propositions.

First, the claim,

based upon cases like Meyer v, Nebraska and Pierce v, Society
of Sisters and, to an extent, Yoder, that a state would be
constitutionally prohibited from Intervening in the parentchild relationship.

ThatTs one proposition.

MR. LACKEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I understand.
Another is that a state may constitution­

ally leave such a decision up to the parent, but need not
constitutionally do so.
MR, LACKEY:

I see that the second point would be

easier and -QUESTION:

Well, that's all you need In this case,,

isn't it?

'
MR, LACKEY:

Yes, sir, that would resolve this

case from that standpoint.
QUESTION:

If you rely on the first point, I suppose

it would be unconstitutional for a state to say an operation
has to be performed by a doctor.
on a heart operation.
MR. LACKEY:

Parents could use self-help

You don't really maintain that.
No, sir, I wouldn't maintain that.

8
My difficulty here is that it was our original position that
the issue was not constitutionally based, that we were

ieing

everything here to a parent acting on medical advice,, and
stating that that was something which had been reserved with
the family and with which we could not constitutionally inter­
fere,

But I certainly agree that it is not necessary to get

to that,
QUESTION:

Your position here is that the Constitution

of the United States doesn't require any mors than what Georgia
has provided»
MR. LACKEY:

That’s absolutely correct, sir.

Either

for the reason that the child does not have a liberty interest
or if the child doss have a liberty interest in this particular
situation^because of the process which we provide* him,meets
all the basic requirements that the Constitution would mandate,
QUESTION:

Of course, the whole procedure has as

its end result the confinement of the child.

Do you suggest

that doesn't Involve a liberty Interest?
MR, LACKEY:

No, sir.

It is our position that the

confinement is secondary and a necessary incident -QUESTION:
MR0 LACKEY:
QUESTION:

That wasn't my question,,
I am sorry, sir»
My question is;

Are you suggesting that

the child does not have a liberty interest at stake?
MR, LACKEY:

Yes, sir, my first position is that in

9
this case* where the parent makes the decision and there is
confinement as a necessary result of that decision* that the
child does not have a liberty interest,,

It is our position

that constitutional rights arise out of relationships and
the relationship that is here is between parent and child*
not between the child and the state.
QUESTION.*

But it is the child who is locked up*

not the parent.
MR. LACKEY:
QUESTION:

Yes* sir* that is correcte
You are not* surely*

or are you —

suggesting in answer to my brother* Brennan's question* that
there is not a deprivation of liberty?
f

MR. LACKEY:

Not in the constitutional sense.

Certainly the child is restrained in the hospital.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that it is the same kind

of deprivation involved — different in degree only

as

having an appendix operation* heart bypass or confinement for
smallpox?
MR. LACKEY:

Yes* sir* that was my whole point,

exactly.*, In response to Mr. Justice Brennan,
wasn't answering his question.

I evidently

The confinement in the

hospital is just a necessary incident, incidental to the
treatment itself.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lackey, if I understand you

correctly. It would be constitutional for a state to say to

10

a parent, "If you want to keep your child in the basement
for the next three years because you think it would be
healthy to keep him out of the sunlight," or something like
that, that would be perfectly constitutional.

Vie just have

to rely on the wisdom of the legislature not to pass such
statutes, but you say if they did there would be no consti­
tutional objection to it.
That's a rather difficult position to maintain.
MR, LACKEY:

It is a difficult position to maintain.

I don't believe I could maintain it.
QUESTION:

You would have a problem there as to

whether or not it was the state that was depriving the child
of liberty or a private person, the parent.
MR. LACKEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Isn't your basic problem of equating

putting a person in a mental institution indefinitely with
going in the hospital overnight for a tonsillectomy?
are two different animals»
MR. LACKEY:

They

^

They are certainly different in terms

of duration,
QUESTION:

And everything else,

I mean if you want

to walk out from the tonsillectomy, you can walk out.
MR. LACKEY:

From a tonsillectomy you, of course,

could, sir, the next day, but from open-heart surgery, for
Instance, you couldn't,

11

QUESTION:

I didn’t say open-heart surgery.

I said

you would equate it with a tonsillectomy or ingrown toenail.
I mean this Is liberty.

When you lock somebody up and turn

the key* that's liberty.

That's a basic denial of liberty

in any sense of the word* when you turn the key.

And in all the

other hospital .cases you mentioned* you don't turn a key on
a person.
MR. LACKEY:

I believe* sir* that children who go

to other types of hospitals for other kinds of surgery are
just as restrained as the children in these cases who go to
mental hospitals* perhaps the duration is different.
QUESTION:
MR, LACKEY:

That's what you think.
Yes* sir.

The resolution of the liberty question* of course*
is not in the case* except* of course* if you find a liberty
interest.
Before we get to the question of what processes do*
we have the Court's question of whether this ease^implicates
or has that quantum of state action necessary to implicate
the Fourteenth Amendment.
Our position on this is simply that due process is
an amorphous concept and perhaps the best thing that can be
said about it is that it requires a case by case examination.
It is our position that in this case what we have Is5we have
private parties* here parents* availing themselves of a

12

resource from the state which is substantially identical to
a resource which could be provided and could be obtained in
the private sector, and that is -- perhaps we can best state
it by saying -- illogical to have a decision where the result
is simply to create two classes of parents. One class of
parents who, by reason of their wealth and their assets and
the finances that they have, can go to a private facility and
can avoid all the process which has been mandated by the
district court.

And another class of parents who because of

their poverty or their inability to pay and who are therefore
forced to rely upon the state for treatment for their children}
that these parents have to go through an adversarial proceed~
ing, such as that mandated by the district court, in order to
simply obtain mental health treatment for their child.
Of course, this has another aspect- too.

The

essence of state action here, if you find it, is that the
hospital is a state facility and that the physician,who is
the psychiatrist In this caso, but the physician who is
authorizing the admission is a state employee,

11“ that is

sufficient to create state action, then this means that in
all of our public hospitals in the dfcafce of Georgia, as
elsewhere, that the admission of any child to a state hospital
for any reason is state action.

And the question will there­

after always be whether the risk of deprivation that flows
from that is sufficient to warrant some sort of hearing.

13
And,, of course# numerous medical treatments# as I've indicated
previously# have potential consequences which are certainly
as grievous as these.
We simply state to the Court that we believe that
it is a matter of logic, when we simply offer a choice# that
that is not a sufficient amount of state action to invoke
the Fourteenth Amendment,
QUESTION:

Mr. Lackey, It doesn’t necessarily follow.,

does it, that if the Fourteenth Amendment applies even to the
heart operation, that there must be a hearing?

It may mean

that there must be due process# but would it not be at least
logical to say that the doctor and the parent provide adequate
process in that situation, but that there are perhaps at
least arguments why a different process might apply where
there is a possible conflict of interest between the child
and his parent,

You don't always have to have a hearing

if you just find the Fourteenth Amendment applies.
MR, LACKEY:
not.

No, sir# and if I said that, I should

You would in those instances have to provide whatever

minimum amount of due process this court or other courts
would deem necessary.
Which brings me, really, to the due process question
which is raised when you find that there is a liberty interest
and when you find there is state action.

The analysis which

we have used is the analysis set forth by this Court in

14

Matthews v, Didridge

which., of course, is a three-step

process, requiring an examination of the interests of the
parties; as a second step» an evaluation of the risk of error
under the present procedures, as well as an evaluation of the
benefit of additional procedures, and»thirdly, an examination
of the burdens imposed on the state by these additional pro­
cedures ,
Isve already spoken about the first issue, the
interests involved, and I'd like to turn to the second issue„
In order to understand the resolution of this,
I believe

that I have to explain to the Court how we perceive

that the system works in Georgia now and how it does work and
did at the time of this litigation; for we believe,as the
Fifth Circuit said in Drummond v, Fulton Co„ Dept, of Family
and Children services, due process only requires a rational
decision-making process.
In Georgia, under our statutes, the parent first
makes the decision that the child is mentally ill, either
because they have had the advice of a physician or because
they notice some aberrant behavior on the part of the child
or, I suppose, for a number of other reasons.

Normally,

although admittedly not always, the parent takes the child
then to the community mental health center, where the child
is examined and if found to be mentally ill, where the
child is treated if that is possible.

15
QUESTION:

What triggers the examination, the

original examination by the physician?
MR. LACKEY:

The parent taking the child to the

mental health center»
QUESTION:
MR, LACKEY:
QUESTION:
MRo LACKEY:
QUESTION:

bo, it is the parant who triggers it.
It is all parent or guardian initiated»
Parent or somebody in loco parentis.
Yes, sir»
Sometimes it might be the family

physician who is involved.
MR» LACKEY:
QUESTION:
MR* -LACKEY:

That's correct, sir.
Is it the parent's decision?
It is the parent's decision to take

the child in the first instance»

And the only place that

the state would become involved, other than where the state
is a guardian, is x^here it was brought to the attention of
our juvenile court system that the child was mentally ill
and not receiving proper treatment, in f/hich case it could
be taken to juvenile court, the state could taka it in.
QUESTION:

What would initiate those juvenile court

proceedings?
MR» LACKEY:

A petition in the juvenile court which

can be filed under our law b;/ any person alleging that the
child has been deprived.
QUESTION:

A neighbor, or -»

16

MRo LACKEY:

A neighbor or a -welfare worker* If you

will* someone from the local mental health agency could do it.
Under Georgia law any person could file that petition in
juvenile court.
QUESTION;

Mr. Lackey, 1 don't want to be capia,s

at all* but "mentally-ill*" can a layman determine that?
Isn't there another phrase you want to say* "appears to be* "
or something?
MS» LACKEY;

Yes# sir.

The way I prefaced it was

if the parent believes the child is mentally ill because a
doctor has told him so# a physician has told him so* or
because he notices some aberrant behavior on the part of the
child.

I thought I said that»

If I didn't* I should have.

But# in any event* the child is treated* at the first level*
is treated in the community if that is possible in most
circumstances.

And then# only then, if that fails* is the

child taken to the mental health center* to the hospital# if
you will* and there the child
QUESTION;
MR. LACKEY:

Treated in the community

by whom?

The ^tafce of Georgia has approximately

50 community mental health centers where children can be
treated as out-patients.

To demonstrate the scope of this*

in 197^; fiscal year 1975 ~~
QUESTION;

May I take one of your hypotheticaIs.

A parent Observes, what parent regards as aberrant behavior

17

on fche part; of fche child, and takes him now, I gather, to
a local community health center; is that it?
MR* LACKEY;

Yes, sir, usually, but I want to

caveat that by saying not always.
the Court on that.

I wouldn't want to mislead

Usually the parent takas fche child to

the community mental health hospital*
QUESTION;

Now, who are the professionals on duty

there?
MR* LACKEY:

Those are state paid, generally,

mental health professionals*
QUESTION:

Not doctors?

MR* LACKEY:
understanding.

Yes, sir, they have *»- it is my

I,.quite frankly, don't believe the makeup of

that, team is in the record — but it is my understanding that
they have a full range, of mental health services that they
provide in the community.
QUESTION:

And whoever it is, one or more is it?

One or more professionals?
MR* LACKEY:

Generally, sir, is what the record

indicates*
QUESTION:

And one or more professionals make a

diagnosis, is that it?
MR. LACKEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And if the diagnosis is fche child may

be mentally ill, then what happens?

18

MR, LACKEY:

Then, If the child can be, the child

is treated in the community, either at home as an out-patient
or through whatever local facilities they have in the com­
munity, group homes and that sort of thing.
QUESTION:

But again, who are the professionals

involved, if it is treatment as an out-patient?
MR, LACKEY:

They are state-paid or county-paid

mental health professionals, psychiatrist, psychologist,
social workers.

It is my understanding, again, that there is

a full gamut of mental health professionals,
QUESTION:

And if that doesn’t work, then what

happens?
MR, LACKEY:

Then the child is referred to the

state mental health facility, the hospital,
QUESTION:

Is there one in the state or more?

MR, LACKEY:

There are eight regional hospitals

in the afcate of Georgia, seven of which have been built
within the ten years preceding this litigation,
QUESTION:

These are nothing but mental hospitals?

MR, -ACKEY:
QUESTION:

Those are mental hospitals, yes, sir,
For confinement as well as treatment?

MR, lACKEY:
QUESTION:

They do confine the patients there.
What happens if the child is referred to

one of those hospitals?
MR. LACKEY:

When a child is referred to a hospital,

19

he is again evaluated by a team of mental health professionals
which, the record indicafees* are psychiatrists, psychologists,
social workers — one even had a director of education in
those evaluations.

That's a separate evaluation and it is

only at that point when that team make® the separate deter­
mination that the child is mentally ill or shows evidence of
mental illness and is suitable for treatment in the hospital,
that the child is admitted to the hospital,
So, our position in this respect is
QUESTION:

You say "admitted," or "committed, "

which?
MHo LACKEY:

admission,

Admitted,

We treat it as a voluntary

He is not committed,
QUESTION:

initiated this.

My hypothetical was that the parent

So this makes it a voluntary admission?

MR, LACKEY:

Yes, sir.

Under our statute, if the

parent,say, ~~ using a hypothetical «*« decides that the child
will not go in the hospital »- oay, the child has been
brought to the hospital and evaluated and the doctors want
to admit him and the parent decides not to admit him, then
the child is not admitted unless the state can go through
the .juvenile court proceeding or through the involuntary
commitment proceeding to get the child in.

The parent holds

the strings, so to speak, not to get him in, because that
takes

to initiate getting him in, of course, but not to

20

physically get him in because that, of course, relies on a
medical determination.
QUESTION:

And of course, all along the line there

is no procedure for questioning the judgments which result,
ultimately, in what you style "admission," the professional
judgments.
MR, LACKEY:

By questioning, you mean appeal to

a judicial body?
QUESTION:
MR, LACKEY:

To anyone.
Well, we believe that each succeeding

step acts as a check on the previous one, of course^ that is,
the parent makes the initial determination, usually the
community mental hea),th center makes the second stage of
determination.

Of course, if the child is not mentally ill

there, they don’t get into the system.

And, thirdly, the

hospital checks the community and the parent,

bo we contend

that each succeeding level is, in fact, almost a form of
appeal, if you will.
this

And, of course, not only do they have

but there is a provision under our law for access to

the courts in Geoj^gia for these children.
QUESTION:
MR. LACKEY:

At what stage is that?
At any stage, sir.

Let me explain,

and I want to be very careful about this.
We have a stata statute that requires the .Department
of Human Resources to see that all patients have access to

21

counsel for assistance in legal matters in which they are
involved.

We have statutes that provide three courts that

these children can go to.

I hadn't thought of it as being

at any stage of their commitment, but I know of no reason why
it could not be.

That is, the children can go to the Superior

Court on a writ which, of course, anyone could do in any
situation like that.
QUESTION:
MR0 LACKEY:

Is that habeas?
That's a habeas, yes, sir.

second, the Mental Health Code — our Georgia
Mental Health Code — specifically provides that the probate
court has jurisdiction to review cases of people In state
mental health facilities to make sure the provisions of the
Mental Health Code are being complied with.
And thirdly, with respect to children, they have
access to the Juvenile Court which has jurisdiction over
children placed in violation of law, over children who have
been abandoned and over children who are deprived, which is
defined as not receiving proper treatment.
QUESTION:

In our hypothetical, how would it occur

to the youngster involved to go to courts at whatever stage?
MR. LACKEY:

That is, perhaps, the most difficult

question that you could ask.

My answer to you is that --

I can onAy illuminate by this case.

In this case it was our

staff that referred these children to their lawyer.

It was

22

our Department of Human Resources that furnished office space
In our hospital to these lawyers.

1 would submit that an

✓

examination of the District Court order» in this case* does
not reveal that so much as a single child had ever been in­
appropriately hospitalized.
QUESTION:

I gather* as you have described it*

Mr. Lackey* it is rather happenstance that they were referred
to lawyers.

There is no champion* so called* for the child

as the child goes through this procedure.
MR* LACKEY:
response to that.

We have two things that I can offer in

I don't know if it is satisfactory but --

We have an Advocacy Unit within the Department itself that
advocates for patients.
QUESTION:

But how does the child get to that

Advocacy Unit?
MR, LACKEY:
two things.

We have

At the hospitals* we have

We have a pamphlet that every patient receives.

It is a handbook on patients' rights* which is
how to describe it to you.

I don't know

The Appellees asked one of our

witnesses whether it was written in children's language* and
I don't know exactly what that is.
QUESTION:

If you have a child five or six years

old* is that a very practical thing?
MR. LACKEY:

I don't know whether it Is or not* sir*

but I think in that case an adult is going to have to make the

23

decision for the child in any event.

And I think that this

case demonstrates that our mental health people there in the
hospital, when it is appropriate, do, in fact, refer patients
who don’t need to be in the hospital, in their opinion, to
lawyers,
That really is the due process that we sea In this
case,
QUESTION:

Before you get too far away from your

description of this procedure, with respect to the voluntary
commitment of the child, it would be helpful to me if you
could just trace very briefly the comparable procedure for
the voluntary commitment of an adult,
MR, LACKEY:

The voluntary commitment of an adult

requires only -- The adult, normally, goes to the community
also.

Vie have a community based program —
QUESTION:

What triggers that?

Let’s assume he is

— Does the Georgia law presume that even though he is
putatively mentally ill that he is capable of making the
decision to voluntarily commit himself?
MR. LACKEY:

Yes, sir.

No person in Georgia is

deemed to be incompetent unless be has been judicially —
has been adjudicated incompetent.

We presume that they are

all competent to seek admission to a hospital,
QUESTION:

Even though at the same time you admit

him to a mental hospital?

24

MRo LACKEY:

That'9 corrects sir* because being

admitted as a voluntary patient requires only that you be
mentally ill and suitable for treatment in a hospital.

It

requires no dangerousness or finding of inability to care for
yourself, which really gets to the incompetency question.
QUESTION:

do, only if he goes voluntarily to a

physician, does the process of a voluntary commitment begin,
with respect to an adult?
MR. LACKEY:

That is initiated by the adult, yes,

sir.
QUESTION:
MR0 LACKEY:

Yes, and then what?
He goes to the hospital or he goes

to the community mental health center.

If he goes to the

community mental health center, they try to treat him in the
community.

If they can't treat him there, he goes to the

hospital.

And if he comes to the hospital and says. "I am

sick and I want in,*1 and the doctor examines him and says,
"Yes* you are showing evidence of mental illness and we think
we can treat you here," he is admitted to the hospital.
QUESTION:

And then after he is inside the

hospital, does he have available to him those two resources
that you mentioned* the advocate and the booklet?
MR. LACKEY:

Yes* sir, he does.

MR. LACKEY:

He has all the procedures except for

the Juvenile Court* is that it?

25
MR» LACKEY:
he has one more.

That, is corrects sir»

An adult can walk out.

And, of course,

That is* he can

say, "I want to leave," and the state either has to release
him or has to begin involuntary commitment procedures»
QUESTION:

And that’s the same with respect to

the child, if his parent does it?
MR. LACKEY:
you just noted.

Yes, sir, with the one difference that

If the parent says, "I want to leave," then

the dismissal of the child would, of course, be conditioned
on his parent's approval of that discharge.
QUESTION:

That whole Georgia procedure, as I

understand it, simply substitutes the parent for the in­
dividual in a voluntary commitment, if the voluntary commits©
is a non-adult; is that it?
MR, LACKEY:

That is correct, sir.

That is

precisely it.
QUESTION;

And what is the definition of a child,

for this purpose In Georgia?
MR, LACKEY:
QUESTION:
MR. LACKEY:
QUESTION:
MR. LACKEY:

A person under the age of 18 years.
Eighteen or under?
Yes, sir,
If he is 18, he is still a child?
If he is 18 he is an adult.

It is

under 18.
QUESTION:

On his 18th birthday, he no longer is

26

a child.
MR. LACKEY:

He becomes an adult on his 18th

birthday.
QUESTION:

So, relying on the parents is really

critical in the case where you are committing just for treat­
ment rather than because someone is dangerous?
MR» LACKEY:
QXJiSTION:

Yes* that is correct.
I take it you regularly commit purely

for purposes of treatment* at the request of the parent.
MR. LACKEY:

As long as 1 can caveat that by saying

we admit at the request of the parents* but only after our
doctors have said the child is mentally ill and suitable for
treatment.
There is another part of that test and that is* of
course* the benefits of the adverse procedures advocated
here.

I think that we have addressed them in our brief,

unless the Court would like me to discuss them.

Because I

would like to turn, just briefly, to the other issue.

And

that is the question of the District Court5® mandating that
we provide treatment for these mentally ill children in only
the most appropriate treatment setting.
What the District Court found -- because we told
the District Court — is that there are certain children who
are in the hospital who are mentally ill but for whom there
are conceivable other types of treatment settings* group homes

27

and this sort of thing.
Going from this, the District Court mandated that
we either discharge these children ~~ in particular these 46*
but, of course, it applies to all children similarly situated
— either discharge these children from our custody or pro­
vide for them the most appropriate treatment setting con­
ceivable, that is, the best treatment setting.

I bring this

to the Court because we think this is, perhaps, as important
as the othdr issue, maybe even more important.

Because what

the District Court has said, in essence, is that if I, or
anyone, takas their child to a state mental health facility
and the doctor there says, "Your child is sick,

I can treat

your child here in the hospital and he will get benefits
frcm:'. it, but if I had my preference I would like to have him
in a group home." and there isn't any group home for that
child.

Then, under this District Court decision that child

cannot be admitted to a state mental health facility.

And,

of course, if we have no group home, he can't go there.

Which

means there is going to be, under this decision, in our opinion
and v?e think it is an inescapable conclusion — there are
going to be children who are mentally ill who are not going
to get treatment for their mental illness in a timely fashion.
The record is absolutely clear that we provided
these children with the most appropriate treatment setting
which we had available at the time.

That Is, there was no

28

finding and no evidence that we have wrongfully kept any child
in the hospital when we had another treatment setting which
anyone thought — our physicians thought was more appropriate
for him.
This mandate by the District Court is simply going
to result in us being unable to serve the children to the
limited extent that we already do, and for this reason we
urge the Court to overturn that portion of the decision,
as well.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lackey, does this involve only the

mentally ill, or does it also involve the mentally retarded?
MR. LACKEY:

This lawsuit only involves the

mentally ill.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lackey, I take it before us in the

Georgia case there are only state hospitals.

There are no

private ones, as I think is the case in the Pennsylvania
situation.
MR. LACKEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that is correct.
Secondly, perhaps you answered this in

your eolloquoy 'with Justice Brennan — In Georgia may habeas
be used to gain release on the ground that a child is no
longer ill?
MR. LACKEY:

I cannot cite you to a case, sir, but

it would be our position that that would be correct for the

29

reason that if the child is no longer ill, the superintendent
is under a duty to discharge him from the hospital, and thus
holding him when he is no longer mentally ill

which, of

course, is not the fact in this case — but holding him when
he was no longer mentally ill would be illegally detaining
him,

I cannot cite you to a case, but we believe a habeas

would lie*
QUESTION:

Habeas wouldn't lie if at the behest of

the child — Eay, a seventeen year-old child who. is confined
called up a lawyer and asked him to file for habeas and the
parents came in and asked for dismissal,
MR, LACKEY:

Yes, sir, .I'll have to assume several

facts with your question,
QUESTION:

If the parents want him cut funder the

law, . he: is r to be . relei s ed.
MR, LACKEY:

Yes, sir.

But if he is not mentally

ill and not suitable for treatment in the hospital, then the
superintendent can’t hold him.

The only way the superinten­

dent can hold him, in that instance, is when the alternatives
that are available would threaten his safety.

Which means,

in your hypothetical —
QUESTION:

But they will entertain habeas at the

behest of a child who-.makes the claim that he is no longer
mentally ill, even though the parents object?
MR, LACKEY:

I cannot cite you to a case, but I

30

believe, as I understand habeas, that would have to be the
case.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Cromartle.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. CROMA FT IE, JR,, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF Op THE APPELLEES
MR, CRQMAHTIE:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In oral argument, I would like to deal with what I
view as the three central issues in this case.

But, before

getting into those three central issues, I would like to deal
with two collateral issues that arise out of the last oral
argument,

'<

-, .

r\

Just very, very briefly, one is a legislative
change during the last session of the General Assembly,
State Legislature passed a new mental health code.

The

The

portion dealing with juveniles was accompanied by what we
call a ’’sunrise provision,”

That Is, if this case is affirmed

by this Court, then those provisions would take effect.

There

was a great deal of interest on the part of the District Court
about what would happen if we strike down this statute.

Would

there be practical alternatives available for parents, for
hospitals, in terms of placing children in mental hospitals.
This new statute seems to comply with all of the
mandates of the District Court, and thus, it seems to us,

31

would be constitutional.
QUESTION:

So I bring that --

How about the children who were ordered

to be differently placed?
MR. CROMARTISj

Are they still in the case?
Your Honor* it is my understanding,

by my last conversation with the state on this, that there
are two of those children, still within the terms of that
order, that is, they are still confined within mental hos­
pitals „
QUESTION:

And to comply they would have to be

placed in different contexts, different environments?
MR, CRCMARTIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

What does the statute do about them?

Does it provide any additional facilities, or not?
'.MR, CROMARTIE:

As I understand the new statute, it

mandates that children be provided with care in the least
restrictive environment; that is, if there were a choice
between a foster home and a mental institution, they would be
placed in the foster home.
I donft think that the new statute specifically
addresses the question that you are asking.
Secondly —
QUESTION:

Mr. Cromartle, before you leave it, do

I correctly understand that the new statute does not have any
effect at all if the decision is reversed?
MR. CROMARTIE:

That is correct, Your Honor

32

QUESTION:

3o, it is fair to say the judgment of

the state is that the District Court is all wrong?
MR, C MART IE:
Attorney General»

That was on the advice of the

We felt like the statute was going to be

passed by the Legislature and supported the passage of it,
but on the advice of the Attorney General, the committee
added in the sunrise provision»

Eo, I don’t know whether it

would be fair to say that it is the judgment of the State
Legislature that the court was all wrong»
QUESTION:

I am not sure ~-

But it makes no change in the pre­

existing statute.» unless there is an affirmance»
MR» CROMARTIE:

Yes, Your Honor, on the advice of

the Attorney General»
QUESTION:

I don’t care where they get the advice,

that’s their judgment.
MRo CRQMARTIE:

Well, they certainly did not put

into effect a new statute, that is correct»
QUESTION:

The state has appealed the decision in

this case and that alone is evidence that the state thinks it
is a wrong decision, isn’t it?
MR. CRQMARTIE:

There is no question about that,

and clearly, in my judgment, the statute that was passed
would have mooted out those aspects of the case.
The second preliminary question I would like to
deal with is a question put to me by Mr» Justice ofcevens right

33
at the end of the argument,
I believe that you asked me the question as to
whether the Georgia procedures are invalid under the District
Court's holding, even as to those children who were within the
American Psychiatric Association's four criteria.

And 1 am

not sure whether» in *ourrexchange *thafc , you.vended up with the
answer that I meant to give to jrou.
What I meant to say to you there was — is that
under the APA standard all of the children under the present
Georgia lav; are in indefinitely,, and therefore the APA
position is that all of those children would be entitled
to hearings,
Secondly, the District Court did not deal expressly
with the other three criteria that the APA set forth, although
I see nothing inconsistent in what the District Court's order
was from those other criteria,
I» personally, have some problems with the specific
four criteria that the APA set forth, but I guess the bottom
line is, no, the District Court decision is not inconsistent
with the APA position.
The three issues that I would like to deal with are,
first, in the circumstances of this case, that is, commitment
of a child to a mental institution, does the doctrine of
parental autonomy or family unity, or however that doctrine
may be characterized, does this preclude additional protection

34
for the child ?
Secondly* does the process at the institution*
itself* adequately protect the child* or is there a need
for more procedures?
Thirdly* will the procedures ordered by the
district Court act as a reducer of risk?

Will they have a

tendency to prevent inappropriate institutionalization?
I have no intention c-f spending time on the sub­
stantive due process issue* although I would certainly
answer any questions.
QUESTION:

I feel like I address those -«*
What do you think the substantive due

process issue is?
MR, CRQMARTID:

It is whether the District Court

was correct in holding that the two

that the forty-six

children should be taken out of the state mental institutions*
when they were faced with evidence from the state* itself*
that these children did not need to be in a state mental
Institution and that they were being positively harmed by
being in that institution.

And* in the face of that* it

seems to me that the court had little other choice but to
order that they be taken out of the institution.
It Is not ~~
QUDuTIGN:

The court held that the United States

Constitution requires that the dfcafce of Georgia provide that
a mentally ill child must be treat©! in the setting considered

35
most appropriate to his condition, either

— That the

State of Georgia must either do that or else not treat them
at all.

And your adversary claims that that leaves no room

for the second or third or fourth most appropriate -- It
is either the most appropriate or nothing, and that the
court held that the Constitution requires that.
MR. CRQMA5TI.fi:

Your Honor, I believe that the

term ‘'optimal" was used by the court.

I believe that they

picked up that phrase from the 1973 study commission.
QUfiaTION:' Where .does the 1973 study commission
get into the Constitution?
MR. CROMARTIfi:

Well* it is a part of the evidence

in this case that said a great deal about the conditions
within the nenfcal institutions within this state.

And the

district Court felt that that study was consistent with its
own observations and with the testimony in this case.
QUESTION:

How does that bear on the circumstances

of cohfinement, to say that the word "optimal" came out of
a study commission report, and therefore the Constitution
requires, quote, "optimal* sUc,lose quote, confinement or
none at all?
MR. CRQMARTIE:

I don’t think that that is what

the District Court ordered in the case.

I think if you will

look further in the opinion, where the Sourt actually ordered
relief, that you will find that what the court said was,

36
’'was fco provide necessary physical resources and personnel
for whatever non-hospital facilities are cleaned by than to
be most appropriate."
I think that the District Court was a great deal
more flexible than that, in terms of what it ordered„

I think

that what it ordered was — is that if these children are
going to be harmed by being in the institution,and the state
admitted this, then they had to get than out of there.
I merely was referring to the optimal as what I
think was unfortunate language.

That does not suggest the

true intent of the court,
QUESTION:

Do you think the District Court’s

opinion and judgment expressly or implicitly says that
anyone who is confined, any child who is confined under
this law is entitled to treatment at the hands of the state?
MR, CRQMARTID:

QUESTION i

I don't understand.

-Uo you think the District Court held

that a child who is committed at the request of the parents
and checked out by the state doctor is entitled fco treatment
while he is confined?
MR, CROMARTXD:

Yes, I think that is implicit,

that at least the child not be harmed,
\

QUESTION:

It certainly is implicit in the second —

with respect to these 40, I take it.
MR. CROMARTID:

I think it is, Your Honor.

37
QUESTION:

Are there some cases that would support

that?
MR. CRQMARTU3:

That would support the treatment

of the children?
QUESTION;

Treatment in addition to confinement,

MR, CRQMA.RTIS:

I think the case of Jackson v.

Indiana and Shelton v. Tucker .and others s speak to the issue
of not harming people; that is, whatever restrictions you
place on children -QUESTION;
confinement.

Say there is no ham, there is just

The state just confines at the request of the

parent.
MR, CRQMARTIS:
in this case.

That Is certainly not the evidence

The evidence of the state’s own doctors is that

the children were being; positively1.being-harmed by being *
in the institution; that is certainly not the evidence that
was before the court,
QUESTION:

And does the evidence show the existence

of institutions in Georgia that.would not harm them?
MR, CRQlARTIh:

There were many children in Georgia

who were In institutions that were not being harmed.

There

were many other children, other than the forty-six, who i^ere
actually being treated.
QUESTION:

There were institutions available in

Georgia that could treat these forty-odd children

38
satisfactorily and not hurt them?
MR» CROMARTIE:

The state's position was that there

were no such institutions»

It is remarkable to me that of

the forty-six — there have been no new facilities built —
and yet forty-four of those children have been placed in
these non-existent facilities.

This would suggest to me that

the facilities are, in fact* present, but the state has not
gone to the trouble to locate them»

And that was the con­

clusion of the District Court also.
QUESTION:

How much time has gone by since —

between the entry of the District Court's decree and the
present time?
MR, CROMARTIE:

I believe that the decree was

entered around February of 1976.
QUESTION:

So, isn't it conceivable that In two

and one-half years there could be a movement of the in­
stitutional population so that vacancies would open up in
existing facilities?
MRo CROMARTIE:

That 3s somewhat possible, although

forty-four of the forty-six were out at the time this case
was last argued —
QUESTION:

That could be because the parents

requested it.
MR, CROMARTIE:
not to that effect.

The Information that I have is

Many of the children were placed in

39
foster homes and other facilities.
It was the District Court's finding that the state
had made little or no effort to find alternative facilities.
I see no evidence in the record to rebut that finding by the
court.
QUESTION:

Do we have something in the record that

indicates that forty-four of the forty-six are now out* and
why?
MR. CROMARTIE:

No* that is information that was

furnished to me by counsel for the state during the last oral
argument of this case.

There is nothing in the record to

suggest that* no* Your Honor.
Dealing first with the issue of parental autonomy*
I would point out first that at least a portion of the class
— it seems to me that the parental autonomy doctrine has
no application to.

That is* those are the children that

were wards of the state and who were actually Institutionalized
by the state* themselves.
QUESTION:

There are children like that In this

case?
MR, CROMARTIE:

Yes* Your Honor* about 20$of the

class would bej in fact* one of the main Plaintiffs* J, R„
was a xvard of the state since near birth.
/

QUESTION:

For what reason?

The parent or parents

were either dead or had been declared to be unfit as parents?

40

MR, CROMARTIE:
QUESTION:

One of these two, yes, Your Honor,

Now, may I ask you — since I’ve already

interrupted you -- is there a provision in Georgia law for
the Involuntary commitment of a child?

Let’s assume his

parent doesn’t take the initiative and, indeed, if it is
suggested to the parent that he do take the initiative, he
says, "Absolutely no,

I will not.

As far as I'm concerned,

my child is either perfectly well or, if not well, he is
going to stay-home.

I am not going to have anything to do

with his being admitted to a hospital."
Is there a provision for the involuntary commitment
of a child, in circumstances such as that?
MR. CROMARTIB:

Yes, Your Honor.

About one-third

of the children that are committed in the state are committed
through judicial proceedings of some kind.
QUESTION:

And through an involuntary commitment

procedure,
MR. CROMARTIB:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Or in my brother, Stewart's hypothetical,

who initiates the commitment?
MR. CROMARTIB;
issue.

I think Mr, Lackey addressed that

I think anyone can initiate the involuntary commit­

ment ,
QUESTION:
court proceeding.

He said anyone could initiate a juvenile
This is a little different.

41
MR, CROMARTIE;

I believe the same is true* under

the involuntary commitment* that anyone can initiate*
QUESTION:

You mean a neighbor may?

MR* CROMARTIE:
QUESTIONs

A neighbor may*

Social worker*

MR, CROMARTIE:

Friend* social worker» whoever* yes*

In fact* back In ray years as County Attorney* when
I was in private practice* all of the juveniles* children 1?
and under* were involuntarily committed rather than voluntar­
ily committed* because the probate judge didn’t have a lot of
confidence in the voluntary commitment.

And it is that

experience that convinces me that those hearings that we
are suggesting should be held*can be held in a way that is
not traumatic —
QUESTION:

There are hearings — I suppose the

involuntary commitment of a child is no different from the
involuntary commitment of an adult* basically^ is that correct?
MR. CROMARTIE.:
QUESTION:

That's true* yes„

And there are hearings when there is

a voluntary commitment of an adult.

There are hearings when

there is an involuntary commitment of an adult, and there
are no hearings when there is a voluntary commltmenfc* there are
simply these same checks on it.
MR. CROMARTIE:
QUESTION:

Is that correct?

Yes.

If you want to analogize* there is a jury

42
trial! you have a right to a jury trial if you plead not
guilty, you xvaive it if you plead guilty., analogizing it,
as you do, to a criminal proceeding.
MR. CROMARTIE:

We are not suggesting that a jury

trial should be made available*
QUESTION:

I know you are not.

MR* CROMARTIE:

The court has precluded that in

the juvenile delinquency —
QUESTION:

But you do analogize this through your

reliance on cases., such as In re. Gault,and others, to a
criminal proceeding.
MR. CROMARTIE:

Yes.

We rely very heavily, in this case, on the magni­
tude of the child's interest.

QUESTION:

That's also true when an adult voluntar... * ;/•'"

.

*

iiy commits himself to a hospital; isn't, it?
MR. CROMARTIE:
sny,

But an adult can turn around and

"I want out," and he must be let out or involuntarily

committed.

A child does not have that option.
QUESTION:

The same option that put him in can

take him out, i.e., the desire of his parent, isn’t that
correct?
MR. CROMARTIE:

That is a disagreement that, I think

43
that.,we had in the last oral argument about whether the
placement of a child in an institution is truly voluntary.
QUESTION:
voluntary.

Well, Georgia has .said that it is

And the question is whether or not Georgia can*

agreeably to the Constitution* adhere to the centuries-old
Common law rule that a parent speaks for his childs

and

the Common Law presumption that there is a community of
interest between child and parent.

That’s the basic question

in this case; isn’t it?
*

MR. CRQMARTXE:

Well* I find absolutely no author­

ity for the proposition that a parent has ever been able to
institutionalize a child in a state mental institution.

I

find no authority to support that proposition.
QUESTION:

What about tuberculosis?

How is it

developed in tuberculosis or smallpox?
MR. CRQMARTIE:

The child would be carried to a

doctor or to a hospital and treated there and we —
QUESTION:

Well* confined —

MR. CRQMARTIE:

It is not my understanding that

tuberculous treatment is confined in the same sense that you
are confined in a mental institution.
QUESTION:

What’s the difference*in the sense*

if he is placed there by his parents and the parents say to
the doctors* "Keep him here until he is well" — or she is
well «-* and they go to see him twice a week?

44
MR, CROMARTIEj

Well, for centuries* the courts

have treated physical care and physical treatment different
from mental commitment,
QUESTION:

Who has treated it differently?

MR, CRGMARTIE:
courts have.

The courts have.

The Georgia

In Morton v, Sims* and other cases* have said

mental commitment is by its very nature coercive.

It is

coercive by its nature* plus it is not -- there are not
commonly accepted medical norms ~QUESTION:

On your first point* that mental care

is coercive by its nature, it is surely no more coercive than
to put a child in a hospital and have his leg amputated
because he has the kind of cancer that might spread.

Would

you agree with that?
MR, CROMARTIE:

I would agree to that, yes, Your

Honor,
QUESTION:

So that doesn’t distinguish physical

care from mental care, at all,
MR, CRQMARTXE:
majority of cases»

I think it distinguishes the vast

I am sure that there are cases at the

far extreme which, in the extreme might —
QUESTION:

Would you say that the parents have to

have a hearing and the child must have a lawyer before the
parent-of an eight year-old child can decide whether or not
to have its leg amputated because of a possibility of spreading

45
cancer?
MR. CRCMARTXE:

There are cases that have held

that that is subject to judicial scrutiny.
QUESTION:

There are cases that hold that the

state Is not prohibited by the Constitution from interfering
in such a situation.

That is quite a different holding.

MR. CROMARTIEs
QUESTION:

Yes.

Would you say the Constitution requires

that of Georgia, if Georgia chooses to come down otherwise?
MR, CRQMARTIS:
QUESTION:

Requires which* now?

Would you say that the United States

Constitution requires that in Georgia before a parent can
have a child put in the hospital to amputate a leg*the
sort of hearings that you are contending for here in
mental cases be had?
MR. CRCMARTXE:

No, Your Honor,

We feel like there

is enough protection in the hypothetical that you have given
me; so that that is not required.
QUESTION:

Protection from where?

MR. CRQMARTIS:
making.

Protection from erroneous decision*»

In the case of the cancer* there are medical tests

that can be run that can tell you one way or the other whether
there is cancer there, or not.
QUESTION:

Well, your first argument, about the

coercive nature of mental care as opposed to physical care,

46
breaks down and you have fco rely on —
MB» CROMARTIS:

Oh# no6

It’s a combination of

those two arguments plus our stigma argument, and —
QUESTION:

But your coercive argument doesn’t wash

in the cancer case.
MR.CRCMARTIE:
does not wash.

There are circumstances where it

It washes# I would contend# in the vast

majority of cases.

But we look on :it as a combination of

all three of those elements, in terras of deciding whether the
two are# in fact# distinct or not.
QUESTION:

Now# once an adult voluntarily gets him­

self admitted to a mental hospital# he is locked up there,
isn't he?
MR. CHOMARTIE':
QUESTION:

He can get out.

And a child can get out on the wish of

his parent.
MR. C ROMA RTIE:

Yes.

In the case of J. L. and J. R.* they wanted out
right after they got in.

They didn’t want to go in.

If

they had been an adult# they could have requested of the
superintendent that they be let out and the superintendent
would eithe r have had to let them out -MR. CRQMARTIE:

If they had been an adult and

didn't want in# then they would not have voluntarily gotten
themselves admitted fco the hospital; would they?

47
MR. CRQMARTXE:
QUESTION:

That's true.

State statutes in most states require

that children attend school for a certain period of time.
Anything in the Constitution of the United States to forbid
that confinement, that limitation on liberty?
MR. CROMARTXE:

We look on that in terms of its

magnitude of any deprivation as just far different from
the magnitude of the deprivation we are talking about right
here.

The courts have always looked suspiciously on physical

confinement, and that's what we are talking about right here.
That's the essence of mental health treatment.

It is what

distinguishes commitment in a mental hospital from, say, a
group home.

It is the physical confinement feature that

distinguishes it.
QUESTION:

What if the parents decide that a

military academy is the best place, as many parents have
for borderline incorrigible’ children, and they place him in
a private military academy where they must keep rigid hours,
they can’t leave the grounds, a whole series of restraints!
what about that?

MR.

CHOMARTIE:

I can’t imagine this Court holding

that there was a need for due process protection there.

For

one thing, I would not find the presence of state action
there.

And sexondly, it is readily distinguishable from our

case here.

We are talking about a situation where the parents

48
have gone to the state and said# "We cannot handle the child.
State* you take the child and lock the child up*" in effect.
That would not happen in the military school situation.
QUESTION:

What's the difference between that —

your institution and a tuberculosis sanitarium* where the
state commits people every day?

They used to when there was

a great —
MR. CRGMARTIE:
QUESTION:

If it was a situation —

— You didn't walk out*either.

MR. CRGMARTIE:

I would then argue there that

any person ivas entitled to a hearing before they were placed
there* because we are talking about long-term —

Do you think a state is powerless to

stop that?
MR. CRGMARTIE:

We have always conceded that

Oh. 1 see.

MR. CRGMARTIE:

— that the hearing can occur

afterwards* that the state's hand is not tied.

QUESTION:

I had thought a good deal of jrour case

depended upon evidence* of which the record contains a good
deal* that because of the relative unreliability of psychiatry*

49
as contrasted with the more conventional forms of medical
practice* a hearing was appropriate because of the consequent
risk of incorrect decisions*

And* that* therefore, you

would distinguish the tuberculosis situation on that basis*
MR* CRQMARTIE:
QUBSTIOM:

That is a part of our argument*

I thought it was*

MR» CRCMARTIB:

1 think that the more basis argu­

ment we have is that when there is a deprivation of liberty
as extreme 3S right here, that* traditionally* our courts
have regarded at least notice and a hearing to the person
involved, and that —
QUESTION:

That would require* I would suppose*

logically* for you to contend that the Constitution requires
notice and hearing with respect to a leg amputation or
admission to a tuberculosis sanitarium*
MR* CRQMARTIE;

I think I would concede the

tuberculosis sanitarium* that it would probably require
a hearing there*

Vie don’t feel like in the leg amputation

that the elements involved that we have in th5.s case,
distinguishing it in terms of family autonomy and breaking
into the family autonomy* would be present in the leg
amputation situation, where they are here*

The potential

for conflict of interest* the sequest by the family Itself
that the child be taken out of the home — we feel like those
are different for those reasons*

50
QUESTION:

Mr. Cromartie* don't you have a lot of

difficulty trying to distinguish on the basis of the magni­
tude of the deprivation?

I thought your case rested on the

point Mr. Justice Stewart made earlier that the Common Law
presumption rests on the notion that there is a community of
interest between the parent and the child, where there would
be in the tuberculosis case, the leg amputation, and all the
rest.

But your point, as I understood you in your brief,

was in part that you can't be so sure there is that com­
munity of interest in the mental institution context when
the parent Is asking that the child be placed in the heme,
because there well may be a family conflict as the source
of the problem.
So, isn't the scope of your argument limited to
the case in which the basis for the Common Law presumption
is no longer applicable?
MR. CROMARTIE:
made.

There were several points that we

That was one of them,

The other was that this situa­

tion was different because the parent had gone to the state
and asked the state to intervene, and in the Wyman, v. James
sense had ceded seme of its authority that it traditionally
would have to the state.

But also our argument was because

of the manifest potential for conflicts of interests Just by
nature, this is a stressful situation, emotion situation.
QUESTION:

That point really doesn't apply to any

of these other hypothetical, examples* as I understand it,
MR, CRCMAHTXE:

It might well not, Your Honor,

I was more troubled by the tuberculosis situation* because
of the stigma* and that sort of thing* involved in that
situation,than I was with the amputation,
QUESTION:

Would you think it possible,

Mro Cromartie,that the child, that is, someone under eighteen
might be so emotionally disordered, disturbed that they
couldn't participate, couldn’t contribute anything,in the
same sense that some defendants in criminal cases are
determined to be not competent to assist in their own
defense?

Now, is that possible that that kind of a situation

could arise with a seriously disturbed child, age sixteen
or fifteen?
MR, CRGMARTIE:

I think it would be very rare.

The evidence showed that most of the children are mildly
diagnosed here.

They are not severely mentally ill,

QUESTION:

There could be psychotlcs at age sixteen

couldn’t there?
MRo CRGMARTIE:

There can be,

The evidence is that

it is not as frequent with children and adolescents,
QUESTION:

Let’s assume for a minute that you have

the very seriously disturbed psychotic, psychopathic person.
You are going to have to have, first, a preliminary hearing
to determine whether they are competent to assist and take

52

part In a hearing?
MR. CRQMARTIE:

Well, Your Honor, in Jackson v.

Indiana, you had a person who, by all evidence, was in­
capable of participating in that proceeding*

And yet the

court felt it was important to provide procedural protections
to that person*

The Code of Professional Responsibility

speaks to that also*

Cannon 7 says that "an attorney’s

responsibility is to do everything that he or she can to
adequately get input from the client into the client’s
wishes, but there may be circumstances where the client is
not able to participate, and in that case the attorney still
has the obligation to fully represent that person*"
Getting on toward the end of my argument, we feel
that the cases of J„ L. and J* R,, very dramatically, illus­
trate how some sort of hearing process, infernal though it
may be, could have prevented both of them from spending over
five years of their lives in a mental institution.

In the

case of J. L«, his primary out-patient therapist bad recom­
mended only a month or so before that he not be institution­
alized.

And yet, Janet Scott's recommendation was not even

considered when J. L. was placed into that mental Institu­
tion.

Of course, also the evidence shows that J. L. was

placed in the institution — the decision was made three
days before he ever showed up at the institution.
QUESTION:

Assuming that I agree with what you say.

53
what’s going to happen if we end up with a hearing with
three psychiatrists on one side and three on the other?
Then what does the court do?
MR. CRCMARTIE:
a decision»

Somebody is going to have to make

That is typical -~

QUESTION:

Have you ever tried to make one with

three psychiatrists on one side and three on the other?
If you ever try it* you will be committed»
MR« CRQMARTIE:

I made them many a time as County

Attorney, when I sat in and was one of the three members of
an interdisciplinary team that sat and listened to evidence
such as that-

It is the same role that any judge performs in

any trial* where you have to weigh the different evidence
presented to you and make a decision based on that.
QUESTION;

What is the issue of fact that would

be determined in the hearing that District Court has ordered
be had?
MR. CRCMARTIE:
basically, in behavior.

Mental illness is grounded *
And there are lots of issues of

fact as to what the person has done that allegedly gives
rise to the conclusion of mental illness»
QUESTION:

That’s the ultimate issue.

QUESTION:

The ultimate issue that the finder of

fact would have to pass on is whether or not the child is or
is not mentali ill?

54
MR* CRCMARTIE;

With expert testimony., yen ,

And secondlys there is the important

and this

may well be the most important issue in this case — and
that is3 should the child toe here or should the child be
somewhere else?

And right now* when you have a physician*

or someone else* at an institution*making that decision*
they have really only two choices.

They can either say*

"Child* go home* we can't treat you at all*" or "We are
going to put you in this institution,"
QUESTION:

What type of person makes this decision?

Is it a psychiatrist?
MR, CRCMARTIE:

I conceded in the last oral

argument that the question of who was not so important as
the question of how,
QUESTION:

It could be a lay person?

MR, CRQMAHTIE:

It could be,

I would not recommend,-

that* but I think it could be,
QUESTION:

What would you recommend?

MR, CRCMARTIE:

X think that the best* and what is

done in the new Act is* the juvenile court judge would make
the decision.

But now that's a matter for the legislature*

it seems to me* and it is not an issue that we have addressed*
nor that we have taken a position on,
QUESTION:

Could I just make sure.

In Georgia now*

If the state doctor determines that the child is mentally 111*

55
does he also have to determine that he would benefit from
treatment?
MR0 CROMARTIE:
is not done.

Yes, Your Honor.

That frequently

The record is very clear.

QUESTION:

Would that be an issue on remand, under

the District Court's remand?
MR. CROMARTIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And does the doctor also have to find

that there is some advantage to treating in the state in­
stitution, rather than at home?
MR. CROMARTIE:
that standard.

I think that that is implicit in

Yes, that that treatment is appropriate

in an institution, as opposed to being in a home or -QUESTION:

So, you think under the present Georgia

law, if the parent says, "Well, I know all that, but I Just
am ~~ I just can't handle him at home.

I agree with you that

he could be treated at home, but we Just can't get along with
him at home," under the present Georgia law, the state must
reject him?
MR. CROMARTIE:

They may not, but it is my position

that they should; but they frequently don't, and the record
is clear on that, that they frequently don't.
QUESTION:

3c the law permits them to take that kind

of a child, just because — although he could be treated at
horae, the parents don't want to treat him at home?

56
MR» CROMARTIE:

That’s my construction of the law,

that it does not allow that»

Obviously, that is not shared

by the psychiatrists»
QUESTION:

Could they not put him in a foster

home?
MR, CROMARTIE:
QUESTION:

Could the parents?

No, the state, if they thought something

less than institutional care was Indicated.
MR» CROMARTIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, they could»

Mr» Cromartie, would the new statute

require a finding that the juvenile would benefit from
treatment?
MR» CROMARTIE:
QUESTION:

An affirmative finding?

MR» CROMARTIE:
QUESTION:

Yes»

Yes»

You said, in answer to Mr. Justice White’s

question, that the present Georgia law does not allow an in­
stitution to receive a patient if the psychiatrist finds that
he could be treated at home.
MR. CROMARTIE:

Is that right?

That's my construction, that if a

child could be treated in the home and would not appropriately
be treated in the institution, then they cannot accept that
child»
QUESTION:

But, suppose he could be appropriately

treated in the institution, in the sense that you can administer

57
the treatment there?
MR® CRQMARTIE:

Okay,

If that's the question, then,

no, I don’t think the law requires that he be in the home
rather than the institution»
QUESTION:

I am sorry,

So, if the parent cones to the state

and says, "I know we could treat him at hone, but I know,
I think and my doctor says he could be treated in the in­
stitution also/’ the state may take them?
MRo CRCMARTIE:
could.

Under the present law, yes, they

If they can be -«•
QUESTION:

How about under the new law?

MR® CROMARTIE: It’s my construction of the new law
that it would not be appropriate there,
