HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 1177, Scott against the State of Illinois.
Hr. Elson, I think you may proceed now whenever
you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. ELSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ELSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
On January 31sfc, 1972, in the circuit court of
Cook County, Petitioner Aubrey Scott was convicted of
misdemeanor theft, for which he was fined $50.
In Illinois the maximum penalty authorized for
this crime is one year in prison and/or a $5CQ fine.
On direct appeal of this conviction, the Illinois
appellate and Supreme Courts held that under Illinois law
and the United States constitution Scott held no right to
counsel, appointed counsel at trial, since he was fined and
not imprisoned.
The Court — this Court — accepted certiorari
on two questions:

whether the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments

guarantee the right to counsel to a defendant charged with an
offense punishable in law by imprisonment, regardless of
whether the defendant is imprisoned.

And second, whether

petitioner's trial was so unfair as to deny due process.

4
Now the trial in this case was not quite what Mr.
Justice Rehnquist alluded

to just now, summary hanging for

shoplifting; but it wasn't that far, either.
With the exception of the right to jury trial,
Scottwas not advised by the trial court of any of the
constitutional safeguards that tnis Court has found fundamental
to fairness in a criminal trial,
QUESTION:

Your position would apply equally to a

$1 fine, would it not?
MR. ELSOM:
QUESTION:

In this case, it would, yes sir.
And so long as the judge was empowered

under the statute to impose a sentence of imprisonment?
MR. ELGON:
QUESTION:

Of up to one year.
Well, so long -- as I understand

your

position would be the same, after the question of the Chief
Justice, if punishment actually imposed were a one dollar
fine, so long as the statute creating the criminal offense
had authorized the trial judge to impose a sentence of
confinement, even of one day.
MR. ELSON:
in our brief.

Well, we don't necessarily go that far

And the facts of this case don't require

that.
Supposedly, the Court, if it should deem it approp­
riation, could make a
jury trial.

But -

six-month rule, as it did in the

5

QUESTION:

But what if the particular provision,

penalty provision, was a fine not exceeding $100?
else, no imprisonment at all.

Nothing

Then would your position be

the same as you’re asserting in your briefs and nere today?
NR. ELSON:

Well, our case certainly wouldn't ue

the same, but our position would be that the crime of
misdemeanor theft is sufficiently established at common law
and in the minds of the community as a criminal offense tnat
it would invoke the Sixth Amendment safeguards.
QUESTION:
rule, as you said.

Now, the Court could make a six montn
But in Argersinger it didn't.

So you're asking us to wholly review Argersinger,
everything about it.
NR. ELSON:

Is that it?
No.

Argersinger, of course, explicitly

refused to decide the question in this case.
QUESTION:

But it did hold that if there’s to be a

sentence of confinement, there has to have been counsel at tne
criminal trials,
MR. ELSON:
QUESTION:
MR. ELSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And you abandon that argument.
Certainly we abandon --- we oppose —
You totally disregard Argersinger in

every respect; that's what it comes down to, isn't it?
MR. ELSON:

Well, not the rationale of Argersinger,

but we certainly oppose a ruling that you're not entitled to

6

counsel .if a penalty is imprisonment; regardless of whether
you're imprisoned.
QUESTION:

You say that Argersinger expressly

refrained from .deciding this case.

I'm not sure I agree

with you.
I mean, presumptively, all state action including
this one, is constitutional unless it's found to violate tae
federal constitution.
And the fact that Argersinger didn't expressly
say this state action is all right doesn’t mean it's an
open question.
MR. ELSON:

Except that the opinion expressly

stated — I think it was Mr. Justice Powell in his conurring
opinion — raised the question, well, what about cases
where the imprisonment is authorized and no jail is ever
imposed.
And Mr. Justice Douglas explicitly stated, we are
not deciding that.

And I think that’s in line with the

tradition of Powell v. Alabama and Gideon v; Wainwrigiit.
QUESTION:

Well, did we need to decide it?

Was

there any occasion to decide it?
MR. ELSON:

No.

My understanding is that, frankly,

the petitioners inthat case actually did not ask for such a
broad rule;

they just said, imprisonment only.

So it wasn't put before the Court, is my understanding

7
of it.
In — I'd just like to briefly refer to the facts
because I think they do make a telling point as to the
r

importance of right to counsel.

Scott in this case was not

advised of and did not exercise the right to cross-examination,
the right to compulsory process of witnesses, the right to
make a closing summation, the right to be informed of tne
elements of the charge against, him, and of course tne right
of counsel, either at his own expense, or at the state expense,
if he could not afford counsel.
Now, the —■ he was allowed to tell his side of the
story, but he was not told that he did not have to tell nis
side of the story.
The trial itself wa3 a paradigm of the prejudice
which results when a defendant is without

counsel in a

criminal trial.
The clearest example of this prejudice is that a
directed verdict motion should have been made and granted
after the state had rested; because the state had failed to
prove a necessary element of its shoplifting prosecution*,
that Scott, in fact, had not paid for tire item he allegedly
stole»
And Scott as a layman had no reason to know that
a directed verdict motion could even be made

8

And I think further prejudice is evident from the
fact that after both the state and Scott had rested, the
judge admitted that he still had several doubts about the
case.
QUESTION:

What if the — what if the state,

instead of having this in the criminal system, had called it
a civil

fine situation, and put a maximum of $500 civil

fine? said, we’re just going to take shoplifting out of tua
criminal . area.
And the judge had imposed precisely the same fine
at the close of this hearing under a system like that.

Would

you say he's entitled to counsel?
MR. ELSON:
case.

Well, of course, that'cl be a closer

But I still think that the crime of tneft is so

associated in our history and in the popular mind with the
criminal element of — of

criminal prosecution, that I think

counsel would probably be required.
QUESTION:

So that a suggestion in one of the

briefs — I don't remember whether it's yours or not — that
states can deal with this problem by simply taking certain
offenses out of the criminal system entirely wouldn't apply
in your case?
MR. ELSON:

I don't believe so.

I think it would

apply to, say, jaywalking, and that type of thing.
QUESTION:

But

Mr. Elson, you keep talking about

9

robbery.

This is shoplifting, wasn't it?
MR, ELSON:

Illinois law.

Well, it's defined as theft, under

Under $150.

QUESTION:

Yes,

It’s shoplifting.

MR, ELSON:

It was shoplifting in this case.

QUESTION:

But you keep saying how horrible a

crime it is.
I mean, I don’t think any adjectives are going to
help this case„
MR. ELSON:
theft.

Except that Illinois classifies it as

And they deem it sufficiently serious to impose — to

authorise a year's imprisonment„
QUESTION:

But you indicated your argument would be

the same even if it provided for no imprisonment, but only a
fine.
MR. ELSON:

The — the — I think the balancing

in that case, it still would ba criminal.
QUESTION:

Well, is the answer to ray question yes or

no.
MR. ELSON:

That I — in that case, I think you’d

be entitled to the right to counsel.

But that's certainly

not our case.
QUESTION:

Would you be entitled to right to counsel

on spitting on the sidewalk ordinance?
MR. ELSON:

Well, if the state authorized a year's

10

imprisonment, I think that9s the prime determinant of what9s a
criminal offense, and yes.
QUESTION:

So itl's the — if you had a fine of up

to $500 for spitting on the sidewalk —
HR. ELSON:

I don't think the rignt to counsel would

probably be appropriate
QUESTION:
MR. ELSON:

in that. case.

And the difference is?
That in that case, it would not have

the element of the indicia of what is a criminal offense,
within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.
QUESTION:
.MR. ELSON:

Which is?
Which are — well, the Court has

identified seven or eight factors in various cases.
QUESTION:
MR. ELSON:

Well, which one are you relying on?
We rely really on all of them.

Because

with misdemeanor theft, they all come together to show that
it's criminal.

They -- thi3 had the year's imprisonment?

it has the requirement of scienter? it was considered malum
in se ? it was indictable at common law? this Court in
Middendorf , said larceny, which is basically, the same thing,
carries the stamp of bad character.
QUESTION:

Is

It has every criteria.

arson the same as robbery?

Is

shoplifting?
MR. ELSON:
QUESTION:

Well, it shows intent to steal, I think.
Larceny

11

HR. ELSON:
QUESTION:
MR. ELSON:
QUESTION:

19la sorry, I said larceny.
I thought you said arson.
Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Mr. Eison, just so that I have your

position in mind.
Of course, as in Argersinger — I never know how
to pronounce that case —holds if there's in fact
imprisonment, there must be counsel; we don't have that case.
You — as I understand, you make alternative argu­
ments.

One, that if the statute authorised imprisonment

for up to a year or more, then the crime would be sufficiently
serious that there ought to be counsel.
Or alternatively,

X understand you to say, that

even if the statute does not authorize imprisonment, but the
statute has all the other indicia of a common law crime,
then there should be right to counsel.
But that case isn't before us.
MR. ELSON:

Right.

I don't think 1 have to make

that case for this.
QUESTION:

It's only the first one we're dealing

with today, is when the statute in fact authorizes a yeax
imprisonment, and it is also a traditional common law crime,
is there a right to counsel there.
That's what we're dealing with today.
MR. ELSON:

That's correct.

That's the only issue

12

I see in this case.
QUESTION;

I see.

QUESTION;

Yet your theory is such that — in

conjunction with the question by Mr. Justice Stewart a
moment ago — your theory is that this is just kind of em
unrolling thing.

And it's unrolled from Powell to Gideon

to Argersinger; these are just way-stations, and presumably
this is another way-station.

Arid a year from now, we'll

be asked to expand it further,
MR. ELSON:

Well, the Sixth Amendment right to

counsel has been termed an evolving concept.
QUESTION;

You think that’s the way the framers

intended it?
MR. ELSON;
QUESTION;
MR. ELSON;
QUESTION;
MR. ELSON:

It’s hard to say.
Do you really think it’s hard to say?
What the framers intended?
Yes.
Well, there's certain things about the

Sixth Amendment right to counsel application now they clearly
had no idea of.
QUESTION:

Well, my question is, do you think it's

difficult to say what the framers of the Sixth Amendment
right to counsel thought about it?
MR. ELSON:
QUESTION:

Oh, no, not in this case.
I didn’t mean this case,,

I meant

13

generally.
MR. ELSON:
QUESTION;

Yes, of course.
You think it is difficult?

MR. E1S0N:
QUESTION;

Yes.
But isn't it really quite clear that

as far as the framers' intent went, it wouldn't have applied
at all to a state trial

All it did was guarantee in the

Sixth Amendment a defendant in a federal trial, not a state
trial —a federal trial —• should have the right to the
assistance of counsel if ha wanted to bring a lawyer along at
his oxvn expense to assist him? that's what it meant.
historian knows that.

Every school boy should know that.

MR. ELSON:
QUESTION;

Right.
Isn’t that correct?

MR. ELSON;
QUESTION;

Every

I believe so.
We8 ve come a long way from there,

haven't we?
MR. ELSON;

Yes, indeed.

And X think the framers —-

it is clear that the framers intended that the right to
counsel was essential in all criminal prosecutions at that
time.
QUESTION; Weil, but the right to counsel defined
by my brother Stewart.

If you could afford a lawyer and pay

for him and bring him along —
MR. ELSON;

Right

14
QUESTION:

— and you were being tried in a

federal court, you could do it.
MR. ELSQN:
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.
Your position -- let me make sure I

understand it —- is that shoplifting from a store, for all
purposes of the stigma, all the consequences ~ shoplifting
from a store is no different from shoplifting from a bank?
MR. ELSON:

In Illinois, if it were charged as

theft under $150, it is not different; that's correct.
His record says, theft.
Of the five grounds for reversal set forth in
petitioner's brief, petitioner relies most strongly, as I
indicated, on the Sixth Amendment grounds.
And there are two alternative rationales for
applying the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in this case.
The first and simplest is that the right to counsel
applies as the terms of the Sixth Amendment specified, in
all criminal prosecutions.

And the Court has never limited

the application of any Sixth Amendment right that has been
applied to the state through the Fourteenth Amendment on. the
basis of the gravity of the crime; except, of course, for the
right to jury trial.
But in Argersinger, the Court, pointed out that the
historical reasons for limiting the right to jury to serious
offenses, do not exist with respect to the right to counsel.

15
And the Court specifically rejected the premise
that crimes punishable by less than six months imprisonment
may be tried without a lawyer, simply because they may be
tried without a jury.
And the right to counsel also requires wider
application than the right to jury, because the nature of the
criminal trial process.

And the Court has repeatedly pointed

out that the right to counsel, and not the right to jury,
is essential to a fair trial, to the integrity of the
fact-finding process.
And as the Court pointed out in Fuller v. Oregon,
the right to counsel is necessary so the defendants may
recognize and take advantage of the Sixth Amendment's other
fair trial safeguards.
Since the right to counsel is therefore the Sixth
Amendment right that is most important to the actual achieve­
ment of a fair trial, it would contradict the Sixth Amendment's
essential purpose of assuring fair trials to apply the right
to counsel more narrowly than the ofiler Sixth Amendment rignts.
Moreover, respondents' argument that the right to
counsel does not apply to petitioner's prosecution
petitioner's right to a jury trial meaningless.

renders

For

notwithstanding respondent's cisse.rti.ons to the contrary, a
lawymen simply cannot adequately present a case to a jury,
under any circumstances.

16

The right to counsel, therefore, roust at a minimum
apply where the crime is punishable in law by over six months
in prison; otherwise the right to jury would simply be a
null •
The —
QUESTION;

I don't happen to agree with your

assertion that a layman can't possibly present a case —- a
defense to a jury if he wants to.

If it's a justice of the

peace misdemeanor type of jury»
In my own practice, I have seen that done.
MR. ELSON:

I've never seen it done.

It's hard for

me, a3 a trial lawyer, to envision it. I —
QUESTION;

Have you never seen juries— have you

never seen juries acquit defendants who have not chosen to
retain counsel on relatively low-grade misdemeanors?
MR. ELSON:

I have never seen it.

There aren't

that many misdemeanor jury trials in the area where I
practice.

But —•
Now, if the Sixth Amendment right to counsel

is to be applied according to its terms in all criminal
prosecution, then there is only one issue in this case, and
that is whether a prosuection for

misdemeanor theft not

resulting in imprisonment is a criminal prosecution within
the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.
And as I have previously stated, in this case it

17
has all the indicia of what is a criminal prosecution.
I don't think respondents really contest that this
is not in fact a criminal prosecution.
But regardless of whether the Sixth Amendment
right to counsel is to be applied according to its terms,
the right applies in this case under the test used for
applying any Sixth Amendment rights to the states, and
that is, whether or not it is necessary for fundamental
fairness.
Now, counsel is fundamental to fairness in a
trial of a misdemeanor that does not result in imprisonment,
as it was in Gideon in the trial of a felony, and as it was
in Argersinger in the trial o::a misdemeanor resulting in
imprisonment.
There is no functional difference between the
trial of a felony and a misdemeanor that would make a layman
a more competent advocate in the one than in the other.
Moreover, I think respondent's distinctions
between misdemeanors that do and do not result in imprisonment
for the right to counsel purposes is in total contradiction
to the rationale of Argersingerj

for if an unconstitutional

misdemeanor trial and conviction that results in imprisonment
does not comport with fundamental fairness, as Argersinger
held, then fundamental fairness also must be denied by an
unconstitutional misdemeanor trial and conviction that does

18

not result in imprisonment.
Because a trial cannot simply be transformed into a
fair fact-finding process because after the trial the judge
decides not to sentence the defendant to jail.
QUESTION :

Yet that was the hypothesis of Argersinger,

was if?
MR. ELSON:

I contend that it wasn't, that Argersinger

stated that a misdemeanor trial cannot be a fair fact-finding
process without counsel; it's as essential as it was in
Gideon.
QUESTION:

But it went, on to say that we don't have --

as you say, putting it I think most favorably to your case, we
don't have to decide whether this opinion or reasoning
applies where there's no threat of imprisonment.
MR. ELSON:
QUESTION:

Right.
And you say .it's just unconceivable

that that sort of rationale makes any sense,, that you could
draw the line between threat of imprisonment and no threat
of imprisonment.
Mr. ELSON: Yes.
difficult to follow.

I find that logically it's very

If Argersinger was preraised on the

needs for counsel for a fair trial, as the opinion indicates
that it was.
QUESTION:

Do you think that it was irrational when

the courts made the distinctions between felonies and other

19

types of crimes?
MR. SLSON:

Well, I think — no.

I think that's

a

legislative task, and I think it valid —
QUESTION;

Well, how about when courts did it?

MR. ELSON;
QUESTION;

I'm sorry»
When courts distinguished the rights to

counsel, Sixth Amendment rights, between felonies and other
types of cases.
MR. ELSON:

Well, I think the Court since then has

gotten rid of that distinction in many cases.
QUESTION;

I think —-

But made a distinction between potential

imprisonment and no potential imprisonment.
MR. ELSON:

Well, Argersinger was the first case

that could be interpreted is that beside the contempt
QUESTION:

But you think the rationale was not,

as Mr. Justice Rehnquist just stated it, of Argersinger?
MR. ELSON:
QUESTION:

Bo I think —
You think that was not the basis of

decision in that case?
MR. ELSON:

No, the rationale from the opinion is

clear that counsel is necessary for a fair trial.
QUESTION:

If the man may go to jail.

And is it

not clear that if the judge trying such a case must decide
in advance if I find this man guilty, am I likely to send him
to prison, to jail, and then if he decides that, he better

20

furnish him counsel.

If ha decides that he isn't going to

send him to prison, but only fine him, then he goes ahead
without counsel.
MR. ELSONs

Well, that's how the holding of

Argarsinger has been interpreted, and that's the narrowest
possible reading.
But, as I say, if Argarsinger held as it did that
there's no difference for fairness purposes in the trial
of a felony and a misdemeanor£ then it just has to follow
that there's no difference for fairness purposes between the
trial of a misdemeanor that results in imprisonment and one
that doesn't.
They're equal —
QUESTION;

Or the trial of one that has only a

fine in it.
MR. ELSON;
QUESTION:

Yes, certainly.
I mean your argument certainly would

invalidate any trial where the only punishment authorized is a
fine unless he has counsel.
MR. ELSONs

If it were a criminal prosecution within

the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.
QUESTION:
MR. ELSONs

Yes, exactly.
Right.

And that's the issue in this

case, is misdemeanor theft.
QUESTION;

Mr. Elson, the whole proceeding is what’s

21

in here?
MR, ELSON:

Yes, it's very short,

QUESTION;

And you need a lawyer.

This is practically

a plea of guilty,
MR. ELSQN:

Well, I think he maintained his

innocence.
QUESTION;

The man --

MR. ELSON;

He didn’t think he was pleading guilty.

QUESTIONs

Well, he said that he went in and picked

up andhad them unlock the case and take out the briefcase.
And he walked around with the briefcase and then started out
the door with it,
MR. ELSON;
for the sales girl.
QUESTION;
MR. ELSON;

No.

He maintained he was still looking

And he was stopped inside.
At the door going out into State Street.
Well , he doesn’t say whether he was

at the door, does he?
QUESTION:

Yes, he said he was at the door at

State Street.
MR. ELSON:

Well, the other door,

that he wasn’t going out.
QUESTION:
for?

But he’s maintained

He was still looking —-

Well, what was he going to State Street,

She was in the store?
MR. ELSON:
QUESTION:

Well, he was still in the store.
Yeah.

22

MR. EL-SON:
QUESTION:
MR. ELSON:

But he was looking for the sales girl.
Mr. Elson —
Yes.

QUESTION:

Wait a second.

QUESTION:

You say in one of your questions

presented the first one, whether the,Sixth

and Fourteenth

Amendments of the United States constitution guarantees
the right to counsel when a defendant is charged with an
offense punishable under state law by imprisonment.
Now I would gather from your answer to Mr. Justice
White's question that although that may be theoretically
presented by the facts in this case, you regard it as being
utterly immaterial whether or not the statute authorizes
imprisonment or not, so long as it's a criminal prosecution.
MR. ELSON:

No, certainly not utterly immaterial.

I think imprisonment is one of the —■ authorized imprisonment
is one of the essential, the most, important indicia —■
QUESTION:

Well, that isn't the way you answered

my question.
QUESTION:

No, you answered his —■

QUESTION:

You were arguing that Argersinger said

that without counsel you can’t have a fair trial.
MR. ELSON:
QUESTION:

That's right.
And I said therefore, i:: the statute

only authorizes a fine, and it's a criminal prosecution, would

23
your theory apply, and you said yes*
MR. ELSON:

Oh, yes*

But my answer to Mr* Justice Rehnquist was that
imprisonment is not irrelevant, immaterial, because that is
an indicia —
QUESTION:

But your theory wouldn't — but your

submission is that it would be just, as unfair a trial if only
a fine was —
MR. ELSON:

That’s right*

But I’m not saying that

unfairness itself invokes the Sixth Amendment.

I’m saying

it has to be criminal and authorised imprisonment is the
essential indicia of criminality.
QUESTION:

You've answered at least three of us

in exactly the contrary way in earlier arguments *
QUESTION:

Well, you're saying that unless

imprisonment is authorised, you would not think the case
could be deemed a criminal case*
MR. ELSON:

No,

The point I'm trying to make is

that in a variety of cases the Court has pointed to six or
seven different factors to determine whether an offense is
criminal or civil.
And you can't — I don't think there * s a general
rule that will take care of all cases.

I think the Court

has to look —
QUESTION:

Well, I know, that's -— so you can

24
imagine a lot of cases where the only punishment authorized
is a fine that you would agree are criminal cases?
MR. ELSON:

I would think so.

I would think taat

if the —
QUESTION:

Well, in those cases at least, you would

say that whether or not imprisonment is authorized —
MR. ELSON;

I would say kidnapping, murder,

certainly.
QUESTION;
MR. ELSON;
QUESTION;

— that he must have counsel,
Yes.
Even though — let’s assume that there

are some cases where only a fine is authorized.

And you can

imagine some that you would agree are criminal cases?
MR. ELSON:

I can imagine — I can't imagine the

state necessarily removing imprisonment, say for something
like murder„
QUESTION;
MR. ELSON:

No, no, no —
But if that happened, I would say that

is sufficiently identified as —
QUESTION;

What about theft, the case we've got

before us, if they removed the possibility
would you still say that's such

of confinement,

an unfairness that there

must be counsel because it is in the criminal framework?
MR. ELSON:

I would think so, because I think the

Sixth Amendment by its terms demands that.

25

Respondent's argument rests primarily on the
proposition that it is too expensive for the state to provide
the right to counsel to indigent misdemeanants who are
not imprisoned.
But there's no legal authority

,

hoi^ever, for the

proposition that under the Sixth Amendment or due process
the state can convict.a defendant through fundamentally
unfair fact-finding procedures because of the cost of providing
fair procedures.
In Gideon, in Argersinger, and in

in re Galt, the

cost of extending the right to counsel ware substantial.

But

in not one of those cases did the Court weigh the costs of
counsel

against the need for counsel for fairness.
QUESTION;

Well, how can you say the cost in

Argersinger was expensive when the — the holding of
Argersinger did not bring about any expense where no confine­
ment was involved?
MR. ELSONs

Well, although there are not accurate,

reliable statistics on this point, I think the

greatest

expense in terms of providing right to counsel in misdemeanor
cases was — happened already as a result of Argersinger,
where the states had developed, for the first time, systems
for supplying counsel to misdemeanants.
And those systems in practically all the states
are not in place.

26

QUESTION:

You mean the Court — you mean the

Court couldn't take judicial notice of the reality within the
overwhelming majority of these minor misdemeanor cases there
is no confinement?
You say there are no statistics —
MR. ELSON:

Right.

But I don't think, the Court

can take judicial notice that the right to counsel is not
available in those cases, and is not made available in
those cases.
I would think the assumption in the absence of such
statistics has to be that most judges are supplying —■
affording the right to counsel in order to comply with rational
principles of sentencing and with legislative intent in
authorising something as a possible sentence.,
I think that was Mr. Justice Powell's statement,
what would happen, in his concurring opinion in Argersinger;
and I think* that's what in fact has happened.
Moreover, respondent's cost argument is based on
the false assumption that the state's only duty is to finance
the prosecution.

But the state also has a duty to assure that

the criminal trial process is a fair one.
r|’he adversary process is really no more than an
empty phrase .if the state can fund the full apparatus of
effective prosecution, including judges, court reporters,
state's attorneys, bailiffs, et cetera, and then just refuse

21
to pay the fraction, of that cost that would go for defense
costs.
QUESTION:

What if a state would set up a system

whereby the state is not represented by an attorney at each
trial; just a typical British police officer comes into the
British magistrate1s court?
MR. ELSONs
prosecutor here.

Well* of course, again, there was a

But I think the fairness argument might be

a little different, but that doesn't affect our Sixth
Amendment argument.
And the fact is that a layman has so much at stake
here that I would think that counsel would be his right.
QUESTION:

So your funding argument is really a

make-weight, because even if the state ware to fund neither
side, you would say you still ought to have counsel?
MR. ELSON:
counsel.

Well, no.

Yes, you still should have

But I don't see that it's a make-weight.
QUESTION:

Well, you were saying that a state has a

duty to equalise and make an adversary system a reality.
MR. ELSONs

Right.
%

QUESTION:

Now, one way it could do it is by upgrading

it so both sides have counsel.

Another way is to downgrade

it so neither side has counsel.
MR. ELSON:

That would reduce the

unfairness in

the adversary process of not having one side represented by

28

counsel,
I don't think that would affect the Sixth Amendment,
Certainly in all the courts that I'm familiar with in my
jurisdiction, the prosecutors are always there,
I would point out that one statistic that is very
reliable is that at least 16 states, including both urban
and rural states, do provide the right to counsel for cases
that have authorized imprisonment.

And there have been no

showing — there is no showing that those

states have sufferes,

by that,
I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Miss Papushkewyeh,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS GERRI PAPUSHKEWYC1I,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT,
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

Thank you,

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The question before this Court is whether or not
the right to counsel which was articulated in Gideon v,
Wainwright, and extended in Argersinger v, Hamlin, should be
extended„
Now, the actual question before this Court is where
to draw the line.

Counsel argues that imprisonment should

be ~ or counsel argues in his brief that imprisonment should

29

be the focus — imprisonment

or non-imprisonment — as an

authorized penalty, should be the focus of any actual right
to counsel,,
However, before this Court he now states that the
criminal — it doesn't matter whether or not there is
authorized imprisonment or not.

He states that regardless of

what the actual penalty is, if there are other indicia

of

criminality, right to counsel would be extended.
And I would imagine that in future cases, he would
come before this Court and say:

As long as there are other

indicia of criminality, don't consider what those conse­
quences actually entail to the defendant, don't consider
what the actual cost is to a state; don't consider whether or
not the defendant is capable of defending himself of those
charges.
Once you — his position is that once you decide
something is a criminal prosecution because some of the
indicia of criminality exist, after that you can't ask any
further questions.
It's our position that this Court must ask some
further questions.

And we submit that the r:.ght to counsel

in this case should be based, after looking — based on —•
should be decided after looking and balancing two factors.
First of all, considering the results to then
defendant, based on the consequences which a defendant may

30

face* arid also his ability to defend hirnsel

in a court;

and secondly, considering the burden on the state courts and
state criminal justice system,
I would first like to focus my argument — and
although I will not cite statistics
focus my argument on a concern

I would first like to

which this Court has

indicated great concern about: it's the efficacy of the
criminal justice system.
Now counsel in his brief argues that there are no
reliable statistics for indigency, and wa really — we really
can't gauge what kind of effect this kind of an extension
of the type that he talks about will cost, the state.

He

says after all that some predictions have percentages as low
as 10 percent in indigency rates.
And I would submit to the court that that's not
the kind of figures that wa are looking at.

The burden that

will be imposed on the states is tremendous.
Reliable figures show there is between a 40 and a
47 percent indigency rate in misdemeanor cases.

Those kind

of figures, when applied to the approximately 5-1/2 million
misdemeanors which are non-traffic offenses which are
prosecuted a year indicate that the burden on the court system
will be tremendous.
And that's not -QUESTION:

Miss Papushkewych, can we assume in this

31

case that the petitioner was an indigent at the time of the
trial?
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

Your Honor, although that was

not established before the actual trial, subsequently to that
and before the appellate court argument and the Illinois
Supreme Court argument, there were —• petitioner filed an
affidavit of indigency showing his assets and liability.,

And

for purposes of the Illinois hearing, there was aai
assumption that -QUESTION;

Assumption that he was an indigento

MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH;

Yes, that he was an indigent.

Well, part of his defense was that he had $300 or
$400 in his pocket at the time — at the time of that
shoplifting, alleged shoplifting.
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH;
of the defense.

Yes, Your Honor, that was part

We have not sought —

because we had

conceded that issue both in the appellate court -—
QUESTION;

You proceed on the premise that he was

an indignent.
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH;

That's right.

We had to proceed

on that premise, because we proceeded on that premise

in

the lower courts„
The burden which the states will face can be
viewed in two different situations.

First of all, if we look

on the burden it places, like, in large counties, the effect

32

of this rule will be to increase the backlog, increase the
workload, and it most importantly I think, in terras of the
criminal justice system, it'll decrease the representation
which we provide for defendants, defendants who are actually
entitled

presently under the Gideon and Argersinger to

receive representation will be represented by the same people
who know represent — who will be then representing persons
who have very little need for counsel.,
Now it is our position in this Court that because
of the character and the nature of the misdemeanor court and
the charges involved, there is"ho right to counsel; that a
defendant can, in fact, defend himself adequately and receive
a fair trial in a misdemeanor court without having the
assistance of counsel.
Notv —
QUESTION;

Does that include if he’s given a year?

MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:
singer, he can't be given any
QUESTION;
broad, there.

No, Your Honor,

Under Arger­

imprisonment.

Well, I mean —- your language was so

I just —

MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH3

I'm sorry. Your Honor.

No, we would agree that under the Argsrsingsr v.
Hamlin, he cannot be given one year in prison.

If the

authority is in the statute for one year in prison, then
counsel is not appointed.

33
It's very clear what the rule is: that imprisonment
may not be imposed., although the alternative sentences may be.
But counsel’s argument is based on an argument that
there is no way that a misdemeanor defendant can adequately
defend himself.

And yet, the- ability to defend himself

is adequately demonstrated by this particular record.
QUESTION:

May I just interrupt there?

There is really kind of a logical dilemma here.
If he ware to be sentenced for a year, he could still
defend himself adequately if it’s the same charge, and all
the rest.
Why does the sentence have anything to do vrifch
whether he needs a lawyer or not in order to adequately
defend himself?
MISS PAPUSBKEWYCH:

Because, Your Honor, I believe

that we've got to look at this case in terms of line drawing.
QUESTION:
I understand it.

Well, that's a tenable argument.

And

And maybe for all these practical reasons,

we should leave the line right where it draws it there.
But in terms of fairness — I mean, the need for a
lawyer, to be sure the issues are fairly presented in an
adversary way at a trial, I don't understand why it makes any
difference whether he's going to be given the year's sentence,
or the judge says in advance, I won't give you the year's
sentence.
Isn't it precisely the same trial problem of getting

34

the evidence out in a fair way?
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

I think the problem becomes —

the actual problem is the same.

What you have to do is

defend yourself in a fair trial.
What wa have decided —■ and my argument is this —that we have to draw the line at some point.

QUESTION:

And this is the

because we've removed the worst
We can no longer imprison him.

But that’s unrelated to the question of

whether he’ll be able to get the facts out in a fair way.

I mean,

just as a practical matter,, we’ve got to draw the line somewhere.
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

Well, I think that he would be

able to gat the facts out in a fair way.

I think the question

is more precisely answered if you consider what we want to
consider as fair when we impose imprisonment and when we don’t.
And I think that what we’ve provided by providing
counsel is not —- goes beyond fairness.

I think what we’ve

provided in our assistance to counsel cases is very extreme

possibilities that may exist for a reasonable doubt,

And

that is the standard that we wish to use where imprisonment
is possible.
But that doesn’t mean that anything l' :'~ is not *

;w

QUESTION:

Let ma ask two brief, related, questions.

Under your view, could the trial judge impose
probation?
MISS PAPUSilKEWYCH:

Yes, Your honor.

The trial

court could impose probation in our view.
QUESTION:

Without a lawyer.

MISS PAPUSilKEWYCH:
QUESTION:
probation?

Without a lawyer.

What if the man violates the terms of

Can he be put in prison?
MISS PAPUSHKEWYC1I:

we would argue:

Under our position, Your honor,

Yes, he could be put in prison.

The

relationship is too indirect, and it requires additional
acts before he is put in prison.
QUESTION:
He's fined.

And supposing he doesn't pay the fine.

He says, well, I've decided not to pay it.

Could he be put in prison then?
MISS PAPUSilKEWYCH:

If the frame of your question

is that if he decides to pay — not to pay the fine, and
it's deliberate action —
QUESTION:

He had no lawyers at the trial.

MISS PAPUSHKEWYC.il:

— I would say — yes, I would

say he could be imprisoned.
However, I would point out that —
QUESTION:
potential of

So that every case really carries a

imprisonment, doesn't'it?

36

MISS PAPUSHNEWYCil:

Many cases, I would argue,

would carry a potential of imprisonment.
I would point out as far as your fine question is
concerned that if lie — the reason ne doesn't pay tue fine
is

because he's indigent, we're of course prohibited from

going — from imprisonment because —
QUESTION:

Well, of course, by hypothesis, we're

only dealing with cases of people who are indigent»

We"re

not talking about those who can hire tiieir own lawyers.
MISS PAPUSIIKEWYC1I:
QUESTION:

That's true.

So that by hypothesis, the category,

they're going to have some difficulty paying tneir fines.
MISS PAPUS1IKEWYCII:

And I taink the Court has

be.fore it presently in Hunter v. Dean —
QUESTION:

Right,

MISS PAPUSHKEWYCli:

■— the varieties of ways in

which states can permit —- or are required to permit —
indigonts to pay fines.
QUESTION:

Right.

But your interpretation of

our -- I just want to be sure — your interpretation is that
either probation is possible, which could be revoked, or
alternatively, an indigent could be assessed a fine of up
to $500 which he might be unable to pay, and tuen lie could
go to jail.
MISS PAPUSilKE'WYClJ:

Yes, Your Honor; that would be

37

our position.
But additionally I would point out that should
furtner decision — and this question has been under review
in many of the state courts that have been faced with the
Argersinger decision —* should the consensus of opinio.
eventually a decision of this Court decide, that

or

it's too

direct a relationship, the state is prepared to live wita
those kind of consequences because I think taat comes within
the bounds of prosecutorial discretion.
What would then happen would be, you would have fines
you would

have

penalties that are somewhat less —* don't

carry all of the stigma that you would get if you were —• if
you actually had counsel.
QUESTION:

Was this man entitled to a transcript

of his trial?
MISS PAPUSIIKEWYCH:
QUESTION:

And he had a right to appeal?

MISS PAPUSIIKEWYCH:
QUESTION:

Yes, he was. Your honor.

Yes, he did, Your Honor.

But he didn't have a right to a lawyer?

MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

He did not have a rigiit to a

lawyer at the trial level.
QUESTION:

How does he know he has a right to a

transcript in Illinois?

Did the judge tell him?

MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

Yes, Your Honor,

lie is notified

of his right to a transcript and of his rigiit; to appeal.

QUESTION:

Before tie trial starts?

MISS PAPUSIIKEV/YCII:

1®m not sure, Your Honor.

believe that's done after trial.

I

But I'm not exactly sure

at this point.
QUESTION:

Is it standard practice to have a court

reporter in the courtroom in all misdemeanor proceedings?
HISS PAPUSIIKEWYC1I:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

Aren't there many — how many states

have complied with Argersinger by saying, we'll give it in
all misdemeanor cases?
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

It's approximately 16, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

That's in all misdemeanors, regardless?

MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

That's in all misdemeanors,

regardless; at least in all misdemeanors that are punishable
by imprisonment, where it's an authorized penalty.
There's some dispute between respondent — petitioner
and myself as to the exact number, but it's approximately
16 to 20.
QUESTION:

Yeah, that's what I thought.

QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be possible to meet your

cost argument by instead of giving counsel to the defendant
having no prosecuting attorney and simply having a policeman
and the defendant come in, if that were the way this Court
were to go?
Your opponent says that would not be sufficient.

39
HISS PAPUSIIKEWYCII:

Yes.

If there is — if there

is a cost — if there is a cost argument.
I don’ t —
QUESTION:

Well, you —• I thought you were arguing

that if we followed petitioner's —- adopted petitioner’s
reasoning, the state would be less able to provide counsel
for those who needed it.
HISS PAPU3HKEWYCII:
that.

Yes, Your Honor, I was arguing

And I — you could have — it would seem to me that

if you had — to the extent that the Court is worried about
the unequal ability of the parties to present their respective
sides, I believe that you could diminish that particular
worry, in addition to diminishing the worry of the cost,
by providing policemen versus a defendant.
QUESTIONs

You might have to pay your magistrates

more, because they would be presumably the only ones that
knew anything about the law.
HISS PAPUS1IKEWYCH:

That’s true.

And additionally

I think that one problem with that that I would point out at
this point would be that the burden in these cases is,
beyond a reasonable doubt on the state.

And you would have to

by putting police officers in, I think you would make it much
more difficult for the state to meet the burden and, you knoi^,
cause various problems to the state in meeting that burden.
If you have an untrained person with that kind of a
burden, instead of the burden of presenting your case and

40

presenting facts to the evidence.
Now, in addition to the cost argument in legal —
in large communities, I would also point out to this Court
that the effect on rural communities is — has been shown
since the decision in Argersinger to be exactly what Mr.
Justice Powell — or -- had predicted that it could be.
In a study, "The Other Face of Justice," which
was conducted in approximately 1974, the courts held —• the
study found that 71 percent — or 61 percent of the judges
interviewed in rural counties — this was where -— in
approximately over 2,000 counties in the United States —
have assigned public defenders systems.
And in interviewing these particular judges,
61 percent of those judges indicated that they had tremendous
difficulties meeting the Argersinger standards.
Now, if they had tremendous difficulties in those
communities meeting the Argersinger standard,, then further —
then they would have even more difficulty meeting a broader
standard.
Now there was further indication in that study that
the response of many judges in these communities — and
they indicated that there was a twofold problem.

That the

twofold problem consisted of the cost and in addition a
scarcity of lawyers in these areas.
And they indicated their response to the Argersinger

41
decision was simply not to incarcerate defendants, because
they could not incarcerate them if they found them guilty,
they simply did not appoint counsel — unl'ass they appointed
counsel, they simply did not appoint counsel and did not
incarcerate,
Now, if you extend that position — the petitioner
takes in this case, the conclusion is inescapable that what
will happen is that municipalities and other counties and
localities will not be able to enforce their own laws„
They will not be able to prosecute at all because
of their inability to appoint a counsel.
QUESTION:

Hiss Counsel, is that a valid argument?

Do they have enough money to hire prosecutors in those
small communities?
HISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:
QUESTION:

What they do in —

Do they have enough money to pay for

transcripts, to authorise appeals, and all that?
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:
QUESTION:

Well —

If they don't, what do they have to do?

They have to appropriate more money.
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:
QUESTION:

Yes, they do, Your Honor.

That's the only way to guarantee a

defendant a constitutional — a constitutional right

to a

fair trial# Isn't the burden on the legislature to put up tne
money that's necessary to accomplish it?
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

Yes, Your Honor, I would agree

42

with that if —
QUESTION:

Then how does tais argument go to tae

question of whether it’s fair or unfair at all?

It's just

a question of what — some states have not fourto. it. appropriate
to spend the money that's required in certain, — in certain
parts of the criminal process.
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:
QUESTION;

Or simply don't have the money.

Is this how we test fairness of tae

constitution; what a state legislature is willing to appropriate?
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH;

No, Your HOnpr.

What my argu­

ment is, that in misdemeanor cases —
QUESTION:

It's not worth the money?

MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH;

No, no, no.

In misdemeanor

cases, fairness can be assured by less than what is being
asked here.

And what is being asked —

QUESTION;

Well, then v.a don't even have to look

at these 16 states.

That's true in Chicago and New York as

well.
I suggest to you that the question of whether tnese
16 rural areas, whatever they are, whether they can afford it
or not really is not relevant to the question of whether it's
required by fundamental fairness or not.
Maybe you-'re right.

Maybe it's not required.

But

t

then it's not required in Chicago and New York, either.
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

The right to counsel for — in

43

terms of —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

No, Your Honor.

I'm arguing

that the right to counsel is not required in any jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

I just don't under­

stand how this question about whether some small communities
have enough money to pay the public defender goes to the
question — goes to the constitutional question at all.
Is that a valid argument?
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

Well, I would say that it’s a

valid argument to be considered in defining the scope of the
right to counsel.
At sometime, this Court is going to have to — when
presented with further arguments, if not in this case, then
in some of the further cases, you're going to have to draw a
line.
And the question is:
put in?

What consideration will you

Will you — what factors will you consider?
And I suggest the cost and the ability of communities

to enforce the kind of rule that you're drawing should be
taken into the practical consideration.
Although petitioner do€is not urge the point here
before the Court today, I would -- oh, additionally, before
I go on to my next point, I would point out to the Court
that under petitoiner's hypothesis, the right to counsel

44
should extend not only to misdemeanor cases, but to the vast
majority of traffic cases.

And statistics are self-explanatory

within the brief.
This would impose even a much heavier burden than
the right to counsel in misdemeanor cases.

It's such a

heavy burden, in fact, that I would submit that this Court
cannot adopt an imprisonment in loss —• an authorized imprison­
ment standard as being urged by petitioner.
Now in his brief, petitioner argues that the
predicted evaluation, which is a part of the Argersinger
standard, is unconstitutional, and violates due process.
Now it's inconceivable to me, and I'm sure would
be inconceivable to many of the court's — system in the
United States.

This Court, in 1972, would have told the

entire nation, all the judges in the country, would have
fixed a procedure whereby they could go — they could
determine whether or not to appoint counsel, and ask — and
propose an unconstitutional method.
Now, we would submit that this decision — that the
decision as to whether or not to predict counsel is exactly
what this Court says it — the kind of procedure that this
Court said it would be.

Definitely within the capabilities

of an experienced judge aided by prosecutor.
Now I think this situation clearly indicates the
predictive evaluation technique is a valid one for the Court

45
to proceed with, and is not in any manner unconstitutional.
It would seem to be no difficulty in this situation,
had Argersinger been in effect whan this case was tried and
decided, for the court to take a look at the particular
offense before it and see thatit was a misdemeanor theftj
that the value of the property was very low; that it was
not charged under enhancement theory.
The only other conceivable question that it could
have asked would have been — to the prosecutor -- do you
intend to ask for jail time.
Given that kind of a situation, we would submit,
that the Court could make a very reasoned decision that in
this case it would be so highly unlikely that I would impose
jail time that there's no need, for me to appoint, counsel.
We would submit that that is an entirely logical
rind constitutional kind of procedure.
Secondly —
QUESTION:

Let me ask one other question about this

particular case.
Is there in Illinois a lesser included offense
which could have applied to the facts here that would have
not. carried the jail sentence?

Something like shoplifting

cr other petty theft type crime?
HISS PAPUSHKEWYCH2
believe that there would be„

Your Honor, just a -- no, I don?t

46

QUESTION:

So that under Illinois lav/, if he was

to be prosecuted, it had to be with a crime that provided
for a jail sentence?
MISS PAPUSHKEWYCH:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that’s

true.
Secondly, I would point out regarding the predictive
evaluation standard, that they provide — they do not abrogate
in any fashion the intent of state legislatures that there
be a broad scope of sentencing alternatives.
The broad scope of sentencing alternatives exists
at any rate, and all the judge does, by discarding one, is
to preserve the options which are contained in the statutes
in all the other — all the other sentencing alternatives.
Now unless the Court has any further questions,
the respondent will respectfully request that this Court
affirm the judgment of the Illinois courts below.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Elson?
MR. ELSON:

Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have two minutes

left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. ELSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ELSON:

I would just like to address the equal

47
protection argument which I believe is compelling in this
case, and made more compelling in light of Mayer v. City of
Chicago and Ross vc Moffifct.Mayer makes clear that the lack of imprisonment,
that the penalty cannot justify withholding any criminal
procedural safeguards on the basis of defendant's ability
to pay.
And then Ross makes clear that the equal protection
rationale of Douglas v, California, which required appointment
of counsel on initial appeal, applies with far more force to
the appointment of counsel at trial, where the defendant is
fighting to maintain his presumption of innocence,

and

where tactically and strategically, counsel can, do the most
good.
It's really too late, usually, to appoint a counsel
on appeal when the pro se defendant has not put in the record
the facts that he needs for his case.
I'd just like to point out that in our brief as now
we do not maintain that the authorised imprisonment is in
itself necessarily the only criterion of criminality in this
case; that there are other criteria as wall that add up to
this being a criminal prosecution.
Unless there are any further questions, thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Thank you counsel.

Very well.
