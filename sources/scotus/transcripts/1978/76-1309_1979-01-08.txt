ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GELLERs

Thank you# Mr. Chief Justice# and may

it please the Courts
This ease is hare on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

It

presents the question whether a district court may properly
suppress probativa and otherwise admissible evidence of a
crime merely because a government agency fails to follow
internal regulations that impose duties upon it not required
either by the Constitution or by statute.
We contend that suppression is an inappropriate
remedy in such circumstances especially where# as in this case#
the agency regulation at issue was not intended to grant
enforcible rights to individual defendants.

The violation of

the regulation was isolated and was not committed in bad faith#
and the defendant has been unable to demonstrate any prejudice
as a result of the violation.
The facts of this ease may be summarised as follows?
In January 1975 Agent Robert Yee of the Internal

4
Revenue Service was auditing respondent's individual and
unemployment tax returns for the year 1971»

At the conclusion

of a meeting between Respondent and Agent Yee on January 27*
1975* Respondent proposed a so-called personal settlement of
his tax difficulties®

He offered Agent Yee a thousand dollars

if the agent, would reduce his estimated tax liabilities by
about one-third®
Agent Yee immediately reported the bribe offer fco
Inspector Hill of the IRS Internal Security Division®

At

Hill's direction* Agent Yee called respondent on January the
30th and arranged a meeting for the following day at respon­
dent's officeo

During this meeting* respondent gave Agent Yee

a partial payment of $500 for settling the tax audit as
respondent has earlier suggested»

Unbeknownst to respondent*

this conversation was recorded by Agent Yee by means of a tape
recorder concealed on the Agent's person®
Agent Yee also met with respondent on February the
6th and February the 11th* 1975®

At the February 6th meeting*

respondent offered Agent Yee an additional $2*000 to audit his
197.3 and 1974 individual income tax returns to respondent's
satisfaction®

And on February 11th* respondent gave Agent

Yee $500 as the second installment for the favorable termina­
tion of the 1971 audit®

The February 6th and February 11th

meetings were also secretly recorded by Agent Yee®
Respondent was subsequently indicted on three counts

5
of bribery.

Prior to his second trial on these charges ? he

moved to suppress the three tape recordings on the ground that
they had not been properly authorised under the applicable IBS
intsr.na 1 regulations governing consensual monitoring of face»»
to-face conversations between agents and taxpayers.

Those

regulations require that, except in exigent circumstances?
advance approval for such monitoring must be obtained by the
Director of the IRS Internal Security Division from the
appropriate officials in the Department of Justice,

The IRS

manual —
QUESTION:

Does this regulation apply to other

types of monitoring or —
MR, GELLERg

There's a ~ the regulation also

applies to telephone monitoring? but there are different
authorisation requirements there and they are not at issue
in this case e the approval of the Department of Justice is not
required, for telephone? consensual telephone monitoring? only
for consensual face-to-face monitoring of conversations,
QUESTIONS

Is there any history that explains, the

distinction between the two? the reasons for it?
MR, GELLER;
QUESTION;

Is it regarded as more offensive to have

a microphone under your necktie than tc* tap the wires?
MR, GELLER:

Well? the sparse history that’s

available to explain the reason for the

adoption of these

6
regulations doss suggest, yes, that the Internal Revenue
Service and the Attorney General thought it was marginally more
intrusive of possible privacy rights to have face-to-face
conversations recorded than telephone conversations? the theory
being that conversations over a telephone are going through
wires, through offices and circuits, and there8s just less
reasonable of an expectation that they* re not being overheard»
Of course, consensual monitoring either by telephone
or by face-to-face regulations, as I'll get to, doesn't
implicate either the Fourth Amendment or any statute»
And the IRS manual also provides that when exigent
circumstances are present, emergency authorisation for
consensual monitoring may be given by the Director of the IRS
Internal Security Division acting alone»
Now, the facts in this case show that on either
January the 30th or January the 31st —
QUESTION;

Who is able to monitor, make a judgment

of the exigent circumstances?
MR» GELLER;
QUESTION;

It's a judgment that -Say» if IRS says this presents exigent

circumstances, can. anyone review that within the government?
MR» GELLER;

I think the exigent circumstances that

the regulations refer to are merely the matter of time that's
involved before the discussions are to take place.
QUESTION;

Suppose the IRS makes that determination

7
and the material is recorded,, and then you get a ease evolving
just 'the way this one does, is the soundness and correctness of
the determination that there were in fact exigent circumstances
open?
MR* GELLERs

Well, it’s our position that the

definition "interpretation of an internal regulation promulgated
Sr

by

an

agencyw should be for that agency and that agency alone.
Nov/, the lower court in this case found that the

emergency provisions of the IRS manual were violated, and while
we disagree with that conclusion we haven't challenged it in
this Court*

And this case reaches this Court on the assumption

that the regulations were in fact violated*

The question is

merely what the remedy should be*
Now, as I was saying, the facts in this case show
that after Agent Yee had arranged the January 31st meeting
with respondent, but before that meeting took place, Inspector
Hill applied for authorisation to monitor the conversation
between respondent and Agent Yse»

The request was transmitted

to the IIS National Office hare in Washington on January 31st,
but it apparently was not forwarded to the Justice Department
until February Idle 7 th»
As a result of this delay, the Director of the IRS
internal Security Division, acting pursuant to the exigent
circumstances provision of the IRS manual, gave emergency
approval to record the January 31st and February 6th conversa-^

8
tions between respondent and Agant Yee.
QUESTIONs

Mr» Geller, let me go back a moment to

follow up on a question the Chief Justice asked you a moment
ago»

Supposing that in a lower court case a statutory issue

and a constitutional issue are both decided against the. govern­
ment. The government decides to seek certiorari but seeks
certiorari only on the constitutional issue.

Do you think that

would be a proper tack for the SGfs office to take?
MR» GSLLERs

Well# I hesitate to answer that question

in the abstract, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I think that

properly, both that the statutory issue should be resolved
before the constitutional one.
QUESTION?

But you don’t feel the

same problem with

respect to whether or not in this particular case Idle agency
regulation was violated, and the more general question of
whether or not what the remedy should be conceding it was
violated?
MR. GELLERs

We have not challenged in this Court,

that the regulation was violated.

I8ia not aware what standards

the Court would bring to resolving a question like that, if the
agency itself says that the regulation has been violated.

But

that's part and parcel of the larger argument that we make
here today, that an agency regulation — violation of an.
agency regulation standing alone does not give anyone any
legal rights that are enforcible in court.

It5s our position,

9
which I hope to elaborate on later in the argument, that only
if a defendant is worse off by the promulgation and violation
of an agency regulation than he would be if the agency had
not promulgated the regulation at all might it be appropriate
for a court, in construing the due process clause, to grant
some form of relief»
Now, the Justice Department eventually approved the
IRS consensual monitoring request on February the 10th, and
therefore the recording of the February 11th meeting was
fully authorised in advance, in full compliance with the IRS
manual, and it*s not at .'.issue here.
And based on this evidence, the district court granted
respondent9s motion to suppress the
31st and February 6th meetings»

recordings of the January

The court found that no true

exigency existed, and that the IRS Agent had therefore
violated the procedures in the IRS manual by not obtaining
approval from the Department of Justice»
The government appealed this suppression ruling, but
the Court of Appeals affirmed»
i

I think it9s important, to begin our discussion of
this case, by asking a critical question that the Court of
Appeals never attempted to answer? and that is?

What is the

source of the district court*s power to suppress the highly
probativa tape recordings of respondent*s conversations with
Agent Vee merely because of the violation of an infernal

10
government regulation?
First, there are several —■ two answers to this
question seem reasonably clear0

First, the power can’t be

found in the regulation itself, the IRS manual doesn't contain
an exclusionary rule, and indeed it specifically provides for
a wholly separate remedy of disciplinary action in appropriate
eases against IRS Agents who violate the manuals
It's also claarthat the authority to suppress can't
be found in the Fourth Amendment or in any federal statutes
This Court has said on a number of occasions that consensual
recording of face*»to-face conversations does not constitute a
search or a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment»
And Title III also specifically excludes consensual recordings
by law enforcement officers from its provisions»
Finally, the Court of Appeals didn't purport to be
ordering the suppression of evidence as an exercise of its
supervisory powers? hence, whatever the legitimacy of a courtSs
ever using its supervisory powers to exclude probative evidence
in a criminal ease, because of an agency's violation of its
own rules,we have substantial doubt as to -QUESTION* What if the regulation had itself said
that, if it#s violated, the evidence shall be excluded?
MR» SELLER*

In that case, we still think it would be

up to the agency itself to decide whether or not to seek
enforcement of that provision, as in fact it does in »» as the

11
Department of Justice does in petit policy eases ~

over Executive Branch agencies# because the position of the
E asesutit?® *»•»
QUESTION *
MR® SELLER:

That isn’t this Court# is it?
Well# we took the position in the

Jacobs case last year that district courts don’t have any

12
broad, undefined supervisory powers, and that's still the
position of the Justice Department,,
QUESTION* Well; but even the defendants in the
Jacobs ease were just arguing that supervisory powers in the
district court or Court of Appeals extends to what shall be
admitted as evidence in the district court, weren't they?
MR* GELLERs

That's corrects,

Although in the

Jacoba case there was a question of how the United States
Attorney or strike force attorney should act in a particular
situation ,
So that leaves us with the claim that respondent
urges most strongly, and that the Court of Appeals appears to
have accepted, which is that the power to exclude the tape
recordings flows from the due process clause of tha Fifth
Amendment,
As we understand respondent's argument, he says
that as a matter of constitutional due process, every agency
must promulgate internal regulations restricting the unfettered
discretion of its employees.
regulations of his agency„

Every employee must abide by the
And every violation of an internal

regulation constitutes a deprivation of due process.
The key assertion is obviously the last one, that
is p that any time an agency fails to comply with one of its
mandatory guidelines, the parson with whom the agency is
dealing has been denied due process.

The respondent relies

13
for this assertion solely upon cases such as Accardi y.
Shaughnessy and Sergios v0 Dulles t but# as the Court pointed
out last term# in Board qf_ Curators va Horowitz;# that line of
cases merely announces the rule of federal administrative lav?#
not a principi® of constitutional law applicable in non­
adjudicative context»

And these decisions certainly didn't

©quate every violation of an agency's regulations with a
violation of the Fifth Amendment»
States# in 348 U,S«# was decided

Indeed# Sullivan vB United
only a few months after

Accardi # yet ‘the Court failed to mention Accardi in denying the
defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment in that case#
because of a violation of an internal agency procedure0
I should make clear that we certainly don't dispute
that there may be circumstances where the government's failure
to follow procedures outlined in its internal regulations
might operate to treat a particular defendant unfairly, might
cause the defendant demonstrable harm*

And there conceivably

may also be circumstances in which the magnitude of the unfair­
ness by the government and the harm to the defenderit might be
sufficiently substantial to constitute a due process violation
that would entitle a defendant to judicial relief»
One situation# for example# might be if a defendant
reasonably relied on the existence of an internal government
regulation fend was then prejudiced by the government* s
unjustified refusal to follow that regulation»

Another might

14
be if a government agant decided not to follow his agency's
regulations in a particular case because of some invidious
reason, such as defendant's race or religion»
But; in our view, if there are circumstances such a:
these in which a defendant would be entitled to judicial
relief, the relief would be based on the due process violation
and not on the violation of the internal agency regulation»
Due process, we believe, cannot be violated by a mere agency
violation, of its own rules»

Defendant is not worse off from,

the violation of an internal regulation standing alone than
he would be if the agency had never adopted the internal
regulation in the first place*
Hence, the existence of and failure to follow an
internal agency regulation, in our view, is, at most, only
of evidentiary significance»

But one factor among many

that must be considered in weighing the defendant's due process
claim»
Now, we've identified in our brief a number of 'the
factors that we believe must be looked at to determine whether
a particular defendant has been deprived of due process,
The essential question, of course, is whether the government's
conduct has

fallen below a standard of essential fairness

that the Court, should not tolerate it»

It is, as the Court

define “due process" in the Russell case, whether the
activity of government law enforcement agents was repugnant to

15
ths American criminal justice system, so outrageous that the
government should be barred from invoking judicial processas
to obtain a conviction,
We think that the facts of this ease demonstrate
quite clearly that the defendant is not treated unfairly in
any way by Inspector Hill's failure to comply fully with the
authorisation provisions of the IRS manual.

Indeed,

respondent really makes no effort in his brief to dispute that
contention.

For one thing, respondent's conduct couldn't

have beers affected in any way by Inspector Hill's noncompliance
with the IRS regulations.

Respondent didn't know that his

conversations with Agant Yae were being recorded,
QUESTION*
two thoughts?

Mr, Cellar, could I interrupt with just

One, you say he couldn’t have been hurt.

Maybe

h© would have bean turned down if he'd followed the procedure
and there wouldn't have been any monitoring? isn't that a
possibility?
MR, GELLERs

It's not a possibility in this ease, as

1 hope to get to in just a moment; but even if he were turned
down, our position would still be that the defendant is no
worse off than if the regulations hadn't been promulgated in
the first place,
QUESTION: So than, on that point, before you get
through, would you make soma comments on VitareHi v. Seaton,
where the man was discharged, he would have been no worse off

16
if they didn't have all 'these procedures, whether he would
have been terminated or not?
MR® GELLERs

Yes,, well, I think in Vi tarsi li v®_

Seaton, just like Aecardi v« Shauqhnassy and Service v» Dulles,
that line of cases, we don't attack the decisions in that line
of cases

in this case; those are adjudicated cases, and I

think that the Courts were announcing rules of administrative
law, not due process®
1 think what we're dealing with her® in this type of
case, and in the Leahey, Heffner, Sourapas lines of cases, ©re
judicial scrutiny of internal government regulations in
connection with prosecutive or law enforcement decision»»
making® And I think that the one, the due process standards
that the Courts announced in overseeing law enforcement
techniques is a much, mush lower standard? the standard I
articulated a moment ago, whether the government's conduct is
so outrageous® that the Court should not allow judicial processes
to be invoked to obtain a conviction®
But there are many facets, obviously, to the question
of must agencies follow their own rules?

And we're only

concerned here with the small facet of the question that
involves criminal investigative or prosecutive policies,
and whether either the dismissal of criminal chargee or the
suppression of evidence in a criminal case is an appropriate
remedy for those types of violations®

i?
QUESTION s

Vitaralli was dismissal from government

service , was it not?
MR, SELLER:

Yes,

Yes, it was.

Now, respondent, as I was saying, didn't know that
his conversations with Agent Ye® were being recorded, and he
certainly didn’t know that they were being recorded without
Justice Department approval.

His incriminating statements

to Agent Yee in the January 31st and February 6th meetings
wouldn’t have varied in any respect if Inspector Hill had
applied for and obtained monitoring authority pursuant to the
routine rather than the emergency provisions of the IRS
manual, as the district court insisted he should have done,
And by the same token, in connection with the question
asked by Mr, Justice Stevens, there was no prejudice to respon*»
dent because if the IRS manu©! had been fully complied with,
there9 s absolutely no question on this record that the
Department of Justice would have authorised Agent Yee to
record his conversations with respondent.

This is not a ease

in which the law enforcement technique ©f consensual monitoring
was ©ally ©£ marginal utility.

For obvious reasons, instances

of attempted bribery by IRS agents have always been considered
to be among the most, justified uses of consensual recording
equipment under the IRS regulations,
Indeed, as 2 mentioned earlier, the Assistant
Attorney General actually approved the monitoring ©f the

18
February 11th meeting in advance , with the knowledge that on
two prior occasions earlier that week 'the IRS had engaged in
consensual monitoring of respondent’s conversations pursuant
to the emergency exception in the IRS manual»
In fact9 there had been an incident in March of
1974 in which respondent also made a statement to Agent Yee
that could have been construed as a bribe offer and at that
time Agent Yes al;;o reported this to the Internal Security
Division, which had sought approval from the Department of
Justice feo monitor faea^to^f&c® conversations between Agent
Yea

and, back in March of 1974, the Justice Department had

also granted approval and had in fact, I think, extended that
approval for five consecutive months» Bo there's no question
that this is a caaa in which the Justice Department would have
granted approval pursuant to the IRS manual and the Attorney
General6 s memorandum»
Therefore, I have & situation her® in which the IPS’
failure to comply precisely with its internal regulations
didn’t treat the defendant unfairly in any way, didn’t lead
to e“i=>

MR» GELlLSRs

I assume, reach the question of prejudice to the defendant,,

been promulgated in th© first place?
QUEST!OH s But your position -- I just want to gat it
straight in my mind; your position really is that even if he

MR® SELLER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct®
«=»*=* otherwise* it.9s kind of a tough test®

MR® SELLER:

I don’t think the Court need reach

that in this ease, because I think our broader proposition is
correst®
We'r® dealing hers then with a regulation that
doesn’t provide any remedy for an aggrieved defendant* and,
indeed as we show in our opening and reply briefs* it wasn’t
©van primarily intended for his benefit®
Finally* there’s no finding by either court below of
bad faith on the part of any of the IRS agents®

We submit

that* in these circumstances* there’s no conceivable basis on
which to find that the government’s conduct treated respondent
unfairly* much less deprived him of dus process* and that
accordingly the district court was powerless to order the
suppression of the taps recordings®
I would, like t© touch briefly on one more point
before ray time expires»,

The conclusion of some lower courts

that the violation ©f an agency regulation alone should entitle
a defendant to the suppression of evidence or the dismissal
of criminal charges' is premised to a large extent on the
notion that* regardless of the absence of harm to the parti eu-"
3,ar defendant* relief must b® ordered in order to give agents
an incentive to follow their agency’s rules®

21
We think that this notion is misguided for the
reasons that were stated by Judge Friendly in the Leonard
ease at 524 F» 2d»

Executive Branch agencies have substantial

incentives* wholly apart from any penalties imposed by the
courts* feo insure that their own procedures are substantially
observed»
Executive Branch agencies presumably adopted the
particular procedure * which was not imposed by the Constitution
or by statute* because it banefitted the agency in some
substantial and significant way,

-tod the earns factors that

caused the agency to adopt the internal procedures should
compel the agency to see that they are obeyed.
Even if suppression would have some marginal
deterrent effect* however* would be far outweighed,, in our
view* by the harmful consequences that would inevitably be
produced by the exclusion of the evidence.
Inherent in the voluntary adoption by the Executive
Branca of internal guidelines is the expectation that the
interpretation and enforcement of those guidelines would be
left to the Executive Branch»

If judicial sanctions are

going to be imposed solely for violation of voluntarily
adopted internal guidelines* the wisdom of adopting those
practices* in the first place* would obviously have to be
re-examined» Therefore* suppression would really punish
society twice®

First* probative evidence of criminal activity

22
would be excluded, and criminal prosecutions would bs impeded?
and, secondly, the government would ha dissuaded from adopting
a great many beneficial rules and practices that go beyond
what 'the Constitution or a statute may require»
Thus, at a time when, as the Court of Appeals candidly
conceded, there's been a growing disenchantment with the
exclusionary rule, w® submit that it would be exceedingly
unwise to extend the remedy of suppression to a situation such
as this one where the Constitution and federal statutos were
fully complied with, and there was, at most, an inconsequential
violation of an internal agency regulation»
Thank you»
QUESTIONS Are any ©£ the eases cited relied on by

prosecution was the Tallin case, which was a prosecution for
criminal contempt ©£ Congress» The Y®\11 in case is, in many
ways, a peculiar case® The Court didn't really explain what

that conviction, although there were two threads that seemed
to run through the argument? one is that there might have been
@©m@ reliance interest on the part of Mr® Tallin, and w© agree
that if there had in fact been a reliance interest created
by a regulation, there may well be a due process violation

with lfcff 2em not sure®

it looks like I might make coffee

*

Mr# Chief Justice# and may it pleas© the Courts
We see the ease before you differently# and 2®d
like to state what, w© think the issue is®
In a ease where there is a mandatory published
regulation by agencies of the Federal Government# which has
been approved on a nationwide basis# for the protection of
fundamental interests of citizens# where that regulation is
violated# where that violation is deliberate and where the
evidence obtained after the violation is sought to be introduced
in a federal district court in a criminal ease# should that
evidence b© suppressed because# as we allege# it will deter
federal agents from committing future violations?
There®s been & lot of briefing in the case# and I
thought I would start by stating what we think the issue is#
and then saying at the outsat that we believe that we can
/

support each element of that standard in this particular case#
QUESTION? Do you suggest# Mr® Brosnahan# that your
client here conducted himself in reliance on the existence of
this regulation in the sense# for example# that VitareHi did
in his case?
MR® BRQSNMLANs
sens®!!

Mr# Chief Justice# only in this

that as a citizen# one of many# one of millions# and

1 don't mean to say to the Court that there was a mental state

26
in the doctor's mind that he focused on this,clearly he didn't,
but there are many other cases where clearly 'that was true, too.
But, as the general sense of a citizen from 1965 he had the
right to believe that no one would ever electronically record
or transmit what he was saying, even to a federal agent, unless
the Attorney General of the United States or somebody designated
by the' Attorney General had approved it beforee
QUESTION: Then you're saying that he had a legitimate
or a reasonable expectation of having a private conversation
when h© offered this bribe?
MR* BROSNAHANs We say, first, that there's been no
conviction of course — there was a hung jury, and no jury has
over found Dr® Caceres guilty, and ha's presumed innocent®
But, aside from that,

we believe that from at least 1967

everyone in the country, including the Attorney General and
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, and other high
officials responsible for the passage of this regulation, have
the right tc assuis® that there would be no such electronic
surveillance®

And Dr® Caceres is one of many that would be

in that state of mind®
I also would say at the outset that it seems to me
troublesome that the government -«»
QUESTION: Well, what difference does it make to the
party involved as to whether the approval of the Attorney
General was had or not?

27
MR. BRQSNAHANs
QUESTION?

It's usual —

Mow would he know 'Shat?

MR. BRQSNAHANs

Wall, ha would not know that, but

the *““=*
QUESTIONS

Wall, what difference does it make to him

whether it was or was not?
MR* BRQSNAHANs

Precisely because the type of

instrument being used is secretive„

The fact that he would

never know it is a greater reason for insisting on the
protection of prior approval,,
QUESTIONS

But he couldn't stop it.

The only

think you're insisting on is -that he should have gotten
approval of the Attorney General.
MR. BROSNAHANs
QUESTION:

Well —

Isn't that the issue?

MR. BROSNAHANs

I think — I think what I was about

to say, Justice Marshall, is thiss

the government argues in

this ease that to succeed the defendant must show personal
reliance and-harm.

That, to me, is an inconsistent way to go

at it.
QUESTION:

But that's not ray question.

MR. BROSNAHANs

No.

Well, I was going to say that

the regulatory scheme -*• and I think tills is responsive to
your question *»“ the regulatory scheme is set up in such a way
that surreptitious monitoring, which no,

one knows is going on

28

except the agents who are doing it, by its very nature will
not occur unless the Attorney General or someone designated
has previously approved it.

And Dr. Caeeres or myself or any

person had the right to go through the country and talk to a
federal agent and believe that there would be no monitoring
unless that approval was obtained.
QUESTION* And if it was not obtained, it wouldn't
be usad?

We can assume that?
MR. BROSNAHANs We know that.
QUESTION:

Well, how do you know that?

MR. BROSNAHANs
QUESTIONS

Because —

It was used in tills ease.

MR. BROSNAHANs

Well, because if the approval is

not obtained ■—>
QUESTIONt Well, is it true that it is, from now on,
people eansfc rely on it?
MR. BROSNAHANs Well, I would say, based upon the
audit that was don© in *74 and based on what's shown in this
case, and particularly if this Court were to hold that it's
all right to use it in a criminal case, that the public's
perception ©£ whether that regulation is worth protection or
not would be that you can't rely on it, and you are not going
to know when -QUESTION:

I donefe see how «*>*=• my one point, is

MR„ BROSNAHAN:

Yes

29
QUESTIONg

«<=» I don't see what benefit or harm it

is to the party involved as to whether or not the Attorney
General had approved the bugging»
MR» BKOSNAHANi
QUESTION*

That9s what 15m listening to»

MR» BRDSNAHANt
reasoni

I would say for this reason

All right»

I would say for this

by the very nature that it's the Attorney General?

the regulatory scheme? when it was passed? imagined that the
high official would exercise very careful discretion —
QUESTION*

Did it say the Attorney General himself?

MR» BRDSNAHANg

Or hie designee»

And that8s what

feh@ —

QUESTION*

I thought that's what it said»

MR» BROSNAHANs

I®vs always used those terms

together? because that's what it said from the beginning? and
it was for a long time the Deputy Attorney General? it was
only the No» 2 person in the* Department if the Attorney General
didn't do it®

We argue from that? and the legislative

history "°*» and I differ in ray point of view from my colleague?
Mr» Cellar? on this —- is not sparse» The record that we have
shown shows that the President of the United States? the
Attorney General of the United States, and the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue all said that from 1965 on there would be a
high official that would review this kind of electronic
surveillance®

And that was because it would be approved in

30
limited casee, and. Attorney General Levi —» and I think this
is how «■=» in 1975 went to Congress, delivered a statement
which is in our Appendix, dealing primarily with foreign
problems, but in that the Attorney General said, and surely
believed it, that these regulations were such that great, time
was taken by his office to review it, to insure that there
would be no violation of private rights, that it was always
done in advance, and that the Congress could rely on that®
QUESTION*

But you didn’t do that in *65®

ME® BROSNAHANs
QUESTION s

In 975, I misspoke? S75s

It was started in 965^ wasnBt it?

MR® BROSNAHANs

In SS5 it was started, and when if

was started, it was dramatic, and I must say that I disagree
with the government9s view of this, it wa3 discussed at the
presidential level®
QUESTIONS

It wasn’t exactly discussed, it was handed

down by the President®
MR® BROSNAHANs

It was handed down, and in the White
e-rr-^T «■

ease in the Appendix there is a quotation from President
Jonns-i• vi in «rich he said that he would see to it, he asked
fchr.fe the agencies look at this because if involved very
important rights 0
QUESTION: And none of those statements said anything
shout asking for court help in enforcing the regulation or
disciplining people violating it?

\

31
MR» BROSNAHAN?

Actually? the statement by Commis­

si oner Cohen attached to the government's reply brief did
refer? at least in passing? to suppression of evidence,»
QUESTION? Attorney general Levi's statement did
not? though? did it?
MR» BROSNAHAN:

K© did not address the question of

suppression,,
QUESTIONS

Of remedy? that's right»

MR» BROSNAHANs

That? we say? is for this Court and

for the courts to deal with»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We'll resume at that

point at ten o’clock in feh© morning? Mre Brosnahan»
MR» BROSNAHANs

Thank you»
