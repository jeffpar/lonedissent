ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLYDE O, MARTE, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR, MARTZ:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please the

Courts
The issue in this case is whether Congress reserved
rights of way across some 34 million acres of land that were
patented in the support of the Transcontinental Railroad con­
struction under the Union Pacific Act of 1862.
The Act is very straightforward.

Section III makes

a grant of every alternate section of public land designated
by odd numbers in the amount of five alternate sections par mile
on each side of the railroad.

This number was amended two years

later to increase it to ten.
The purpose is stated in Section III as aiding in the
construction of said railroad and telegraph line and to secure
the safe and speedy transportation of the mails, troops, muni­
tions of war and public stores thereon.
Congress made three categories of exceptions.

First,

it provided for an exception for land sold, reserved or other­
wise disposed of by the United States prior to the fixing of the

4
road.
Secondly, it excepted or exempted mineral lands and
third it excluded or required the reversion of lands not sold
or disposed of within three years after the completion of the
road.
It contained no exceptions or reservations of any
kind of rights of way across the land, rather, this is not in
issue or in dispute in the case.
Section IV then directed that after acceptance of
each 40 miles of line constructed, patents shall issue con­
taining the right and title of said land to the company and
it provides no qualification with respect to the right or
title of lands that are conveyed.
Petitioners in this case are successors in interest
to the railroad grants of Section III lands on the east side
of Seminoe Reservoir in the State of Wyoming and have grants
under Section IV without reservation of any kind in the patents
for crossings.
Petitioners also hold the alternate, even-numbered
sections under grazing license pursuant to the Taylor Grazing
Act of 1934.
The controversy in this case arose in December of 1973
when officers and agents of the Department of Interior commeneed constructing a road from a public highway westerly to
the eastern shore of Semino® Reservoir across public domain

5

sections and the alternating checkerboard lands that Petitioners
patented under the 1862 Act.
They did this without consent of the landowners and
without payment of any compensation or fencing of the road
for the protection of the lands crossed.
Petitioners filed an action to quiet title against
this claim.

The parties stipulated as to the facts and sub­

mitted the matters to the Federal District Court in Wyoming
for — on cross motions of summary judgment, on the title
issue.
The District Court quieted title in Plaintiffs, con­
cluding that there were no rights-of-way reserved either expressly or by implication? secondly, that no rights-of-way
by necessity could be implied in favor of the sovereign since
the sovereign has the power of eminent domain to take such
ways as it needs at all times and the Court further found that
for 110 years after the grant of the fee lands to the Union
Pacific Railroad Company, neither the Department of the Inter­
ior nor any

other agency or agency of the United States con­

strued the grant or the patents issue pursuant thereto as con­
ferring any right upon the United States, its agents or the
public, to traverse the lands granted to the railroad.
On appeal to the Tenth Circuit court, that decision
was reversed, the Court of Appeals finding that there was a
right of way reserved by implication, saying to hold to the

6
contrary would be to ascribe to Congress a degree of careless­
ness or lack of foresight which in our view would be unwar­
ranted .
Petitioner submits that the decision of the Court of
Appeals should be reversed, the decision of the trial court
affirmed, for several reasons, fch© first and foremost being
that the Court of Appeals presumed an intent that was not ex­
pressed anywhere by Congress in the legislative history or in
the debates or in the language of the Act*
The Court of Appeals considered no administrative
experience under the Act in 110 years of patenting of land,
QUESTIONS

Incidentally, what has been happening about

this for 110 years, Mr. Marts?
MR. MARTS:

Mr. Justice Brennan, absolutely nothing.

The United States in its brief acknowledges that it has ac­
quired rights-of-way by purchase when it has needed them.

So

far as the record shows, there has never been a condemnation
action to acquire a right-of-way.

It would appear, Your Honor,

that this is a new idea that was —
QUESTION:

But -there must have been rights of way

all this time.
MR. MARTSs

Yes, Your Honor.

I think if we look at

the history of the Union Pacific Act and the way in which this
alternate section concept was used by Congress to encourage
settlement and development of the lands and support the

7
railroad, this becomes understandable.
Congress started back in 1827 according to the legis­
lative history in providing support for public improvement by
contributing the proceeds from the sale of public lands.
did this for canals.

It

It did it for highways and it did it

starting in 1850 for railroads.
The idea was that it would give the proceeds of sale
to an enterprise that was providing a public improvement.
QUESTION?

‘That got to be a very politically hot pota­

to after awhile, did it not?
MR. MARTS:

That is right, Your Honor and one response

to the political hot potato was the checkerboard pattern.
QUESTION ?
MR. MARTS?

Right.
Congress was criticised for giving away

lands so it theorised —
QUESTION?

Internal improvements, that was called.

MR. MARTS?

Internal improvements, yes, but if we

were to —
QUESTION?

And everybody in Congress shied away from

that phrase.
MR. MARTS?

Right.

And it provided that what we will

do is subsidise the project with alternate sections and we
retain the intervening section for sale for the public treasury
and if settlement occurs and fell© country grows, the land re­
tained can be sold for double value and w?e recover the prise of

8
the subsidy,
QUESTION;
MR. MARTZs

That is right,
Now, it looked at the enterprise as pro­

moting settlement through sale of lands concurrently with en­
tries under the preemption act of the alternate sections and
in the experience for 35 years, from 1927 to 1862, the lands
were settled along the canals and the highways without reserva­
tion of rights-of-way, without rights-of-way problems and with­
out creating a checkerboard pattern of land ownership.
It is a case where a person settling on an odd section
of land pays one seller. He settles on an even section of land,
he pays another.
Now, this was the picture in 1862 —
QUESTION;

And, of course, many roads were built across

both kinds of land by state and local government.
MR. MARTZ;
QUESTIONt
MR. MARTZ;

Precisely.

Land was not —

And by condemnation.
And simply by the cooperative efforts of

the settlers. As we know, when people moved west to settle,
they followed trails of convenience; whether it went across
public or private land was of no concern to either.

There was

a — as this Court has developed in 'die Buford case, in the
Canfield case that has come up under the Inclosures Act ques­
tions, it has recognised a law of the open range where people
had a right to push livestock, graze livestock on unfenced land

without regard to land ownerships *
This was the climate.

But there was another facet of

been trying to get it from the mid~185Q5s.

It had

It was a big gamble

because there was nothing west of the Missouri but Indians and
sagebrush.
The railroad was created by the Act* the Union Pacific
Road but it could not get private capital to support this
gamble.

This Court reviewed the pressures on Congress in the

Platt case in 1879 and said strikingly enough, "We do not now
attempt to portray the earnestness, the all-absorbing earnest­
ness with which Congress sought to secure the constru:tion of
the road by private enterprise."
In 1862 it gave five sections of land on either side
of the roadj in 1864 it increased it to ten sections.

This

Court said in Platt that was necessary to push the project.
The Court said, "Suffice it to say, the purpose of
Congress above all others was to obtain the construction of
the railroad by the corporation it created to undertake the
work.

For that alone the subsidy bonds were given and only

for that the grants of land were made.”
QUESTION:

Well, it was British capital that finally

built the Union Pacific, was it not?
MR. MARTZ:
QUESTION:

I am not aware of that, Your Honor.
Well,

Grenville Dodge was behind it, was

it not?
MR. MARTZ:
QUESTION;

Was what, sir?
Was it not Grenville Bodge who was behind

it, from Omaha?
MR. MARTZs

I do not have that in my writ.

QUESTION:

Does this record show, Mr. Mart2, to what

extent the rights of way were taken by condemnation, either
federal or state, over this whole history?
mean precisely.

That is, I do not

Was that a lot of right-of-way and a lot of

money or a small amount?
MR. MARTZ:

No, as fax as I know — you are speaking

of the private condemnation, of government condemnation to get
the rights of way across these tracks?

As far as the record

shows, Your Honor, in all three levels of court there has not
been a condemnation proceeding initiated by the Unite I States.
At least, none has been brought to the attention of
any court by the Government.
QUESTION:

It is a little puzzling why this has taken

so long to mature into this situation.
MR. MARTZ:

Well, may I suggest that as the lands

were, in fact, settled in the west, if we leave out the checker­
board pattern for a moment, you do have, as Mr. Justice Stewart
suggested, haveaday-to-day, week-to-wesk ©volution of road or
trail construction which trails became roads by proscriptive

11
easement»

The land was not of great value and access was ob­

tained .
QUESTIONS
and is today.

Some of it became very valuable timberland

Is that not so?

MR, MARTZs

Well, this happened yes, through the years

when rights-of-way might be purchased,

I recall, as this

Court said in the Canfield case, "Every landowner has a right
to enclose his own land," and obviously, if he does this, this
may interfere with access to other lands but the Court said,
"This cannot really be a practical problem until such time as
the west is fully settled and at that point there will be roads
to the area."
QUESTIONS
MR. MARTZs
QUESTIONS

Mr. Marts?
Yes, Mr. Justice.
As a practical matter, how much are we

really talking about in this case, with Leo Sheep Company —
apart from your parade of horribles in your brief.

But all we

are talking about is an easement across the corners, is it not?
MR. MARTSt

That is right, Your Honor.
We are talking of very few dollars.

We

are talking, though, about a principle that if these checker­
board lands were patented without reservation, the isnue today
is not really whether the United States or any other private
party has a right of access to cross a section of land to reach
an adjoining section of land.

The kind of case in which this

12
question is being raised is precisely the kind that gave rise
to this controversy, the construction of a roadway across a
ranch area for access not of a few people but of the public to
a recreational area without fencing the road for the protection
of the integrity of the ranching area.
Now, these are the kinds of questions in which this
issue may be

raised and it is on these kinds of questions

that we need clarification of these rights.
QUESTION:

Following up on Justice Blackmun's question,

is it not true, if you look at the checkerboard that it would
always be possible to stay on government land except where you
have to cross at corners?
MR. MARTZ:
QUESTION:

That is right.
So is it not possible that Congress ~~ you

mentioned the widespread understanding that people could go
anyplace they wanted to in those days without worrying about
having somebody build a fence in front of them.

Is it not

likely that Congress did not dream that there would be any
problem about cutting across a corner every mile or so?
MR. MARTZYour Honor, I would submit that Congress
did not dream that there would be checkerboard ownership of
the land through the support program.
QUESTIONs
MR. MARTZs

At least to start with.
No, YOur Honor, it had already hud 35

years experience in entering lands in the alternate section

13
basis.

Had the railroads, in moving west, followed the pro-”

visions of the Act and obtained patents of the completed —
each 40-mile piece of land and so3.d those lands off to settlers
to raise money to continue to build the road as it happened
with the canal program in the east, you would have scattered
settlements on odd and even-numbered sections, the same as you
would have under the Homestead process.
What happened that Congress could not have anticipated
in 1862 when it enacted the Homestead Act opening th© west and
the Railroad Grant Act for the Union Pacific Road was that for
the first time the public enterprise would not sell the land
to settlers but would mortgage it in its entirety.

It was the

mortgaging process that created a pattern of checkerboard owner­
ship that became a matter of concern ter* years after the; grants
were first made.
QUESTION?

Mr. Marts, am I wrong in thinking the Home­

stead Act of 1862 authorised only 160-acre homesteads?
MR. MART5$;
QUESTION s
MR. MARTSj
QUESTIONS

That is right, Your Honor.
I am correct?
That is correct, Your Honor.
And was it the Desert Land Act in 1877 or

the Farmers and Stock Raisers Act in 1960 that finali/ want to
640?
MR. MARTSs

Well, tiers was an Enlarged Homestead Act

first in — I cannot give you the date, 1890 or 1900 — and

14
then the Stockraising Homestead Act want to 640.
QUESTION:

But at any rate, at the time of these rail­

road grants, the homestead was 160 and not 640.
MR. MARTZ:
poraneous .

Well, Your Honor, it was really contem­

Congress had had no experience under the Homestead

Act.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTZs

They passed at the same time,
They passed in the same Congress; and the

Homestead Act says, we are opening the west.

You can settle

on 160 acre-family units.
They said to the railroads, we are granting alternate
sections to you for you to dispose of.

They did not*, to be

sure, limit the sis© of the disposition.
But it did say, any lands which have not been disposed
of in three years after completion of the road will then foe
opened to entry only under th© Homestead and, preemption laws.
So Congress was looking at the sale of lands:' while
the railroad was being constructed and th© residual lands
would besom© part of the public domain package and -«=
QUESTIONs

Yes, but they were selling to their own

facilities — did they not?
MR. MARTZs

fraud.

Yes but there were a lot of sales

15
MR. MARTZ?

To a point where Congress — and this is

most significant, too, that after the problem of the checkerboard grants became very real during the range wars of the
18808s and the 1890’s where, as you say, these packages, lands
were transferred to subsidiaries or to private companies who
tried to utilise the checkerboard pattern of ownership to
seise control of great amounts of the public lands and led to
the enactment of the Unlawful

Inclosures Act of 1885 and it

led Congress in 1887 to affirm the titles of bona fide pur­
chasers from the railroads.
Had Congress had any reservation at all as to whether
it had or had not made a reservation of rights-of-way in 1862,
it certainly had the right when it affirmed the patents of
bona fide purchasers in 1887 to clear it up.
QUESTION?

Now, how does an individual apply all of

that which came about at a time, to quota you, there, was
nothing beyond Reserve but sagebrush and Indians at- !the time
.when California was the largest state in the Union.

QUESTION;

States Government giving away ray land without retaining an

MR. MARTZ:
homestead grants.

Well, it did not retain easements in
As a matter of fact, the United. States has

not retained an easement of this kind in any grant.
As this Court said in Platt, the purpose of idle grants
was to support the road.

It was to enable the railroad to sell

these lands to settlers moving along the road west and using
the money for the construction of roads.
Now, if Congress allowed homesteads on even-numbered
sections without any reservation of right and said on the oddnumbered sections, Mr. Railroad, you have got to give us an
easement — undefined across that land, how successful, would
the railroad have been in competing with the Homestead Act in
selling any lands — assuming the lands were of equal quality.
The purpose, this Court said in Platt, was to support
the railroad and to settle the west.

The three-judge dissenting

opinion in Platt is., I think, vary helpful in getting this
whole matter in focus.

h

Tills was the Court speaking at the time when Congres­
sional intent was still fresh in everybody's mind.

The major­

ity in Platt allowed the railroad to hold tills acreage on the
theory that the mortgaging was the disposition sc that; within
the three years after completion of the road the railroad did

17
not have to either settle it or give it back for entry under
the Homestead or Preemption Laws.

It could hold it»

The dissent in Platt, said , this is not what Congress
ever intended.

Congress intended these lands to be settled

and that the railroads would not be able to hold them by morthold
gage. It could not/this landlocked checkerboard pattern and
had the will of Congress been carried out without the mort­
gaging process we would not have this problem today.
But the fact remains the lands were patented.
was no reservation.

There

The legislative history would affirm the

faot that there was no intent on the part of Congress to make
such reservation.
Now, 1 want to save five minutes for rebuttal but I
want to make one comment about the two cases that the Court of
Appeals used not as precedent but as comfort in support of its
decision, these being the Buford ease and the Canfield ease
that came up with respect to the practices that were then in
existence at getting monopolies on the public lands by use of
this checkerboard acreage.
Buford said, no private landowner can enjoin or re­
cover trespass damage for the crossing of unfenced open lands
associated with the public domain.

Canfield sai , it is a public

nuisance of the holder of chackorboarded lands to fence it and
thereby, even though the fences are on private lands, enclose
blocks of the public domain.

18
QUESTION:

Canfield was based on a Act of Congress

so specified,, was it not?
MR. MARTZ:

The Act of Congress saying there shall

not be an inclosure.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTZ:

Yes.
The point, gentlemen, I want to make is

that in both of the Acts and in both of the cases, looking
first at Buford, this Court made it clear that what it was
speaking of is the custom of the open range that had lasted
for 100 years, that you cross land, whether in public or in
private ownership, in cattle drives or with grazing, without
liability in trespass or without hindrance.
If the private landowner wanted to protect his land,
he had to fence it and this Court said in Canfield, if he
fences it, he is entitled to exclusive possession.
Now, the Court below7 and the Government have argued
that these cases suggest the existence of rights-of-way across
the odd-numbered sections because
