MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Arizona Public Service Company v« Snead.
Mr. McAuliffe, will you proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL J. McAULIFFE5 ESQ. 5
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR® McAULIFFE:

Mr, Chief Justice,, and may it please

the Court:
I had not Intended to present separately the under­
lying facts of this proceeding nor a description of the pro­
ceedings which bring us here except as they may be pertinent
to argument or to questions from the Court®

I would be happy

to state the facts separately if the Court so desires8 other­
wise I will proceed with the argument®
QUESTION:

We will leave that entirely in your

handss counsel®
MR. McAULIFFE:

I believe that they are adequately

set forth in the briefs®
Essentially9 Mr, Chief Justice and the Court, this
is a discrimination case.

It involves the constitutionality

of the New Mexico Electrical Energy Tax Act®

Let me explain

initially exactly how that Energy Tax Act operates3 and I
think you will understand th© discriminatory operation of the

tax,

Section 3 of the tax purports to impose a levy on
the generation of electricity generated in New Mexico for the
— it states that it is on the privilege of generating elec­
tricity for sale®

While that appears even-handed9 section 9

of the Act significantly affects the way that tax operates.
Section 9 is the credit provisions

And the two pertinent

provisions we believe are sections 9(B) and (C)e
Section 9(B) provides that a generator who produces
electricity in New Mexico which will be consumed in New Mexico
may take an energy tax that is imposed and credit it against
a gross receipts tax liability which will incur upon the
retail sale of electricity®
Again, that credit provision of section 9(B) is
available and applies only if the electricity is generated,
and consumed in New Mexico.
Section 9(C) deals with a separate situations because
if you look at the wholesaler of electricity, the local
generator, for example, who will sell the electricity initially
for resa.les the section 9(B) credit is of no assistance to
that entity, for the simple reason that the gross receipts
tax does not apply to a sale for resale at the wholesale
level.

As a result, there is no gross receipts tax liability

against which to credit the energy tax assessment®

Section

9(C) takes care of that situation®

included

Indeed, it was

in the Act specifically to take care of that situation.

5
Indeeds it was included in the Act specifically to take care
of that situation.
What section 9(C) provides is that the credit granted
by section 9 will be assigned forward by the wholesale seller,
which for purposes of argument I will call the generator.

It

generally is — there is some confusion generated when you are
trying to describe both parties to that transaction.

The

generator is normally the seller in the wholesale transaction.
The generator assigns that credit forward to the purchaser in
the wholesale transaction who is generally the retail seller,
in exchange -»
QUESTION:

Within the state or out, or could it be

either?
MR0 McAULIFFE:

The credit is assigned forward, it

is only with respect to electricity that will be consumed in
Mew Mexico.
QUESTION:

The party who generates the electricity

may sell it to a wholesaler within the state or without, is
that so?

MRo McAULIFFE:
he may.

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice,

Again, the section 9(C) credit though will be limited

to —QUESTION:

To just the one?

MR. McAULIFFE:

— to just the one, where the

electricity is eventually consumed in New Mexico«

In exchange

6
for the assignment forward of that credit, the generator will
eventually receive a monetary reimbursement from the retailer
in the amount of any credit actually received by application
against the gross receipts tax liability of the retailer,
The net effect of these provisions throughout the course of
this litigation has been undisputed.
The energy tax applies only to electricity which is
generated in New Mexico and transmitted to other states for
retail sale and consumption.

It collects no revenue whatso­

ever from electricity which is generated and consumed in the
State of New Mexico,

We contend that tax is discriminatory

against interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

But if you look at the overall effect of

the tax, the tax structure of New Mexico, New Mexico consumers
of electricity may well pay just as much as consumers in other
states.

Isn’t that true?
MR. McAULIFFE:

Not if you — at the consumer level,

1 am not sure that is true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because then
you are taking into account whatever tax may be applied at the
consumption level and the state of consumption.

New Mexico

consumers pay a total tax or the total tax — we can take it
all the way down to the level of consumption in New Mexico —
is a

percent gross receipts tax imposed by the state.

And

when we get to the constitutional argument, our position is —■
that the state’s position is obviously that that saves the

7
energy tax, but our position is that even when you look at
the whole scheme of taxation, looking at the treatment of
wholesalers, you do not have that equality of treatment.

You

have a facial equivalence looking at the scheme as a whole,
but at the wholesale level there is no Mew Mexico tax.
QUESTION:

When you say the wholesale level, you

mean sales by the generator to others who in turn sell at
retail?
MR. McAULIFPE:
Justice Rehrtquisto

Sell at retail, that's correct, Mr.

The initial aspect of the discrimination

issue is that which involves the Tax Reform Act of 1975, which
was passed during the pendency of this litigation.

We have

particular reference to section 2121(a) which is codified as
Title 15, United States Code, section 391«

That statute pro­

vides in effect that no state may impose a tax on or with
respect to the generation or transmission of electricity which
discriminates against out-of-state producers, generators,
wholesalers, retailers, or consumers.

The statute also de­

fines what is discriminatory, and that xs if it imposes a
greater tax burden on electricity, whether directly or in­
directly, on electricity which is generated and transmitted
in interstate commercea
We believe that the New Mexico electrical energy
tax clearly satisfies that definition.

There has never been

any dispute that it is a tax on or with respect to the

8
generation or transmission of electricity, and it is dis­
criminatory o

It imposes a greater tax burden on elect3^icity

which Is generated and transmitted to other states, states
outside of New Mexico.

That has never been disputed.

As a

matter of fact, the legislative history of the statute we be­
lieve confirms that.
QUESTION;

Doesn't the legislative history show that

that federal law was enacted with this statute as a direct
target?
MR. McAULIPPE;
QUESTION;

Yes, it does, Mr0 Justice Stewart.

Then, of course, it was amended and your

brother on the other side claims that it was during the course
of its being amended It was whittled down to being almost
meaningless and not to cover this statute.
MR, McAULIPPE:

Well, it was not really amended.

Let me explain what the course of the legislative history was.
There was a provision In the Senate Finance Committee, which
was reported to the Senate floor and passed by the Senate.
This was the provision that Senator Domenici moved to strike
in its entirety, and that said that if the state imposed a
higher gross or net tax on electricity, then that was the
statutory definition of discrimination at that point.
QUESTION:

Then the Senators from a couple of the

other states, West Virginia and Washington, got disturbed
about It

9
MR. McAULlFFE;

We have no legislative record of

thats Mr. Justice Stewart, and I don*t believe that the
state's brief cites anything in the legislative record to
support that contention.

There was a bill introduced approxi­

mately a year before the Tax Reform Act which would have
stricken down all state generation taxesa

There was a hearing

held on that bill in March of 1976, and representatives from
the States of West Virginia and Washington appeared and.
questioned whether ~ as a matter of fact, 1 think the refer­
ence they used in the hearings was this is an over-reaction to
the specific situation in Arizona and New Mexico, it goes too
far, you're not striking a discriminatory tax»
have no idea what happened to it.

That bill, we

We then pick up a separate

legislative history ~
QUESTION:

Anyway, it was not enacted?

MRo McAULlFFE:

It was not enacted»

When we get to

tlie Tax Reform Act, now the change that was made was when the
differing versions passed by the House of Representatives and
the Senate went to a conference committee, and the conference
committee changed the language to its present formulation»
The conference committee report, both in the House and in the
Senate, says that it is adopting the Senate amendment.

There

is no other explanation for the change, and I think without
inquiry and speculation of the legislative record, we are
entitled to assume that they adopted the intent of the Senate

10

as well»

And the intent of the Senate,, at least as reflected

in the Senate was quite clear.

The Senate Finance Committee

describes the type of tax they are talking about and it
describes on all fours the electrical energy tax of the State
of Mew Mexico»

Senator Domenici appeared at the time the bill

was introduced for debate and moved to strike it in its
entirety, and the exchange between he and Senator Fannin and
Senator Goldwater makes perfectly clear that what his concern
was, that this would reach the Mew Mexico tax, and Senator
Domenici*s amendment was defeated»

So we think the legisla­

tive history is quite clear on that one point»
The lower court in effect we believe disregarded
this statute and said that it incorporated a constitutional
test.

We submit that is a very strained reading of it»

The

statute refers to not only a tax, it refers to a particular
class of taxes, a tax on or with respect to the generation or
transmission of electricity»
1 turn then to the constitutional argument.
S

Again,

••

the energy tax, as we have described, is discriminatory in its
actual operation.
QUESTION:

The state contends that although the —
Mr» McAullffe, just before you leave the

statute, of course, you rely primarily on the second sentence
of the statute, rather than the first, because —
MR» MeAULIFFE:

1 don’t know that we would say we

rely any more on one sentence than the other, because the

11
first sentence —
QUESTION:

It talks about discrimination against out-

of-state manufacturers, and there is no out-of-state manufac­
turers being discriminated against here, is there?
MR. McAULIFFE:

According to state of residence, they

are out of state, but the —
QUESTION:

Well, that is not what it means, is it?

MR. McAULIFFE:

That's correct.

We would rely on

the second — the second sentence contains the test of discrim­
ination.
QUESTION:

In effect, you read that as broadening

the first sentence then, basically?
MR. McAULIFFE:
QUESTION:

I read —

The first sentence literally just doesn’t

, apply, as I read it.
MR. McAULIFFE:

Well, the first sentence stiys that

no state shall discriminate, which is —
QUESTION:

Against out-of-state manufacturers, pro­

ducers, at cetera, but you are not an out-of-state producer
within the meaning of this, are you?
MRo McAULIFFE:

1 don’t know that — the statute

doesn’t define what an out-of-state producer is.

I would argue

that it refers to a producer who is producing electricity
principally for consumption out-of-state.
QUESTION:

That is not what it says.

12
QUESTION:

That is not what it says.

MRo McAULIFFE:

It says out-of-state manufacturers,

producers —
QUESTION:
out-of-state

It doesn't talk about production for sale

It seems to me the first sentence would apply

to an out-of-state generating plant that was selling electricity
into your state and you had a higher tax on that electricity
than on locally produced electricity9 but that is not this
case.

But the second sentence I would say does read on your

ease.
MR. McAULIFFE:

1 would agree with you, Mr. Justice

Stevens.
Turning then to the constitutional argument, the
state's defense of the statute is that you can't view the
energy tax in isolation, that you have to look at the state's
entire scheme of taxation.

Even adopting that as the constitu­

tional test, it does not save the energy tax because we believe
that that test involves considerably more than simply looking
at tax incidences and tax rates and discovering whether those
are so glaring in equality.
If that were the analysis, and that is the analysis
the state employs, then the Halliburton ease would have been
decided differently, because in the Halliburton ease there was
facial tax equivalence between the sales tax and the use tax.
The difficulty in Halliburton was that one component of that

13
facially equivalent tax structure affected a class of tax­
payers differently, depending upon whether they were involved
in Interstate commerce or not.

That is exactly what happens

here when you look at the wholesale transaction.
Again, if the wholesaler sells that electricity for
consumption in New Mexico, it will eventually receive a tax,
a private tax rebate from the retail seller in the amount of
any credit actually received which will wholly erase any
energy tax liability.

The interstate wholesaler, the whole­

saler who markets that electricity which is consumed in other
states receives no such credit and pays the energy tax.
In effect, the interstate transaction is taxes, the
Intrastate transaction is tax-free.
QUESTION:

Do the opinions below indicate how sub­

stantial a portion of the total business the wholesaling of
electricity is?
MR. McAULIFFE:

They do not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

The opinions below do not address the issue of discrimination
of wholesalers at all.

In the appendix in our answers to the

Bureau of Revenues' interrogatories, reading them together
with the affidavits which were submitted in connection with
our initial motion for summary judgment, you will find the
most complete figures available are for 197^, an<3- they are
only partial.

They do not include figures for Southern

California Edison.

They indicate that our purchases of

Ik
wholesale electricity were approximately

4*5 million kilowatt

hours of electricity and our sales of electricity at the
wholesale level were approximately 7*5 million kilowatt hours9
for a total of 1*2 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.
That is roughly 10 to 12 percent of the total electricity
generated by us In New Mexico*
of it.

That is the approximate volume

It is9 of course, going to fluctuate year by year9

depending upon demand and whether particular facilities are
on-line or off-line9 but I think that is a rough9 rough ap­
proximat lorn,
Under the Halliburton case9 the test is whether the
component tax provides equal treatment to in-state and out-ofstate taxpayers similarly situated*
does not*

We contend that this tax

When you compare the situation of the wholesaler

who sells Intrastate with the situation of the wholesaler who
sells interstate* there is no even-handed treatment.

They are

subject to disparate burdens and that is discriminatory.

And

although there has been a significant change in recent years9
a reformulation of the test which this Court will apply to
state taxation in interstate commerce* that principle remains
unchangeds and that is that a state tax may not discriminate
against interstate commerce.
We also contend that this tax imposes undue burdens
on interstate commerce.

The state*s response to this is that

the tax cannot impose an undue or what used to be called a

15
multiple burden on interstate commerce, because it only applies
to the act of generation which only happens in New Mexico®
contend that that is a fiction*
not

We

As a practical matter, you can»

• at the time electricity is generated in New Mexico

under the state’s own regulations, it is subject to potential
credit*

Whether the potential credit becomes actual or whether

it vanishes depends upon a subsequent determination as to the
state of consumption®

At the time that determination is made,

that electricity is already in the transmission or pipeline,
if you will, traveling at the speed of light®

The tax,

whether it is a tax on sale or a tax on consumption, liability
for that tax, the assessment for the amount of that tax

that

is due cannot be made at the point of generation, it can only
be made at the time that it is determined where that is con­
sumed*

So we contend that the tax is perfectly analogous to

the tax in Michig&n-Wiseonsin Pipe Line v. Calvert.
Th@i*e the tax was imposed on the taking of gas,
taking of natural gas, and the principle vie© of the tax was
that it was imposed on the entire volume of gas taken®

This

Court has subsequently held that the vice there was that it
was unapportioned to activities within the state.
exactly the same tax.

This is

This is a privilege tax, just as the

tax in Michlgan-Wiseonsin was.

This is a tax which is imposed

on the entire volume of gasoline that Is taken — the entire
volume of electricity taken outside of the state*

This is

16
just as much a tax on the exit from the borders of New Mexico
of electricity as was the tax In Miehigan-Wisconsin.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that a state cannot make

the generation of electricity a taxable event?
*

MR. McAULlFFE:

No, I'm not, Mr, Justice Rehnquist.

What I am saying is that this tax does not do that, because
this tax «— this does does not impose a levy on all generation
of electricity, and because it credits or exempts certain
generation, you cannot determine whether yoii are liable for
this tax until after generation happens.

It has to be trans­

formed and transmitted, and the place of consumption determined
before you know whether this tax is due®
A straight-forward generation tax, such as was in­
volved in Utah Power & Light, it can be determined at the
point of generation, whether that tax has to be paid.
can’t be done here.

It

Revenue concedes that when in its regulations it says that
energy that la generated at that- point in time is subject to

The Act doesn’t refer to any such poten­
But if you are going to straight­

forwardly apply this tax, then you have to have a potential

QUESTION:

Mr. McAuliffe, you may have covered this

17
anci I might have missed it, but does the state give a credit
on the gross receipts tax to an out-of-state generator who
might sell electricity within the state?
MR. McAULIFFE:
QUESTION:

Well —

For a similar tax imposed by the other

state.
MR® McAULIFFE:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

That Is section 9(A).

9(A) does that?

MR® McAULIFFE:

Yes»

All that provides is that if

there is a tax, a generation tax imposed by another state and
the energy Is transmitted to New Mexico and consumed there,
then you are entitled to take — if it is retailed in New
Mexico, you will incur the gross receipts tax and you are
i;

entitled to take a credit against that gross receipts tax.
QUESTION:

What is the amount of the credit?
■

MR® McAULIFFE:

It is vrtiatever tax Is imposed by the

other state®
QUESTION:

Even if it was a full 4 percent, then

conceivably they xrould pay no gross receipt^ tax?
MR. McAULIFFE:
Stevens®

I would assume so, Mr. Justice

Our position is that the debtor obviously cannot

cure the problem®

That is the same offer of reciprocity that

was made in Austin v® New Hampshire.

It Is exactly the situ­

ation that the Congress was concerned with when it passed the
Tax Reform Act, that what you would be producing is a taxing

This is a privileged fcax9 it is a tailored
It has to be subjected to strict scrutiny9 and

when it is it produces the effects which this Court has always
held are prohibited by the Commerce Clause.

It discriminates

against Interstate commercea pure and simply., and it transfresaes the provisions of the Tax Reform Act ©f 1976.
Mr» Chief Justice, if there are no further questions.,
I reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr» Unna.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN E» UNNA, ESQ. 9
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. UNNA:

Mr. Chief Justice9 and may it please the

Court;
The heart of this case is in two issuess the Tax
..

'

v

•

Reform Act9 section 391s and the constitutional case law.

I

want to discuss the constitutional case law first and then
turn to the Tax Reform Act provision.

In discussing first the

constitutional ease law, I want to weave It in with the actual
operation of the tax to show why New Mexico's tax restructuring
with its Electrical Energy Tax Act is clearly nondiscr3minatory
under the ease law from this Court.

19
QUESTION:

As long as you are going to talk about

the constitutional issues first, you would agree, we would
have to decide the statutory issue first, don't you think?
MEo UNNA:

Yes, and I think the statutory issue is

the more important issue, really.

Before the Electrical

Energy Tax Act which established this generation tax and the
tax credit was enacted, the tax on electricity generated in
New Mexico but sent elsewhere,to Southern California or
Arizona, was zero.

There was no tax burden whatsoever on

electricity generated and consumed or sent outside the state.
There was, however, a local tax, a gross receipts or a sales
tax on electricity sold in New Mexico, a ^ percent gross re­
ceipts tax.

So if I use Arizona Public Service, one of the

generators and sellers of electricity elsewhere, an exporter
of electricity from New Mexico, compare that with Public
Service Company, which is the largest generator and retailer
of electricity in the state, compare their burdens for ease
of comparison, for illustration purposes, Arizona Public
Service was

subject to absolutely no tax burden before this

generation tax was passed,,

Pub lid Service Company of New

Mexico, however, was subject to a ^ percent burden.

Then we

have the generation tax passed in 1975;. with the credit at .4
of a mil per kilowatt hour, which works out to a 2 percent,
approximately a 2 percent tax»
After the Electrical Energy Tax Act, we have Arizona

20
Public Service now subject to a 2 percent tax burden, a gener­
ation tax burden, no gross receipts tax burden because it
doesn’t sell its electricity in New Mexico —QUESTION:

Mr. Unna, could I interrupt you once more?

MR, UNNA:

Yes0

QUESTION:

You say no tax burden whatsoever.

Don’t

they pay real estate tax and personal property tax and income
tax and various other taxes?
MR, UNNA:

Yes, Mr» Justice, but the burden on

electricity per se was sero.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. UNNA:

And for purposes of at least as I read

QUESTION:

You don’t want us to look at the total

the

picture, we just look at those on electricity per se?
MR. UNNA:

Yes, the commodity of the electricity as

it is referred to in the case law.
After the Electrical Energy Tax Act is passed, we
have Public Service now subject to a 2 per cent generation tax
burden also,, but it is allowed to credit this 2 percent burden
against its 4 percent gross receipts tax liability, so that
its total burden is 4 percent, that is the 2 percent generation
tax burden and 4 percent gross receipts tax minus the 2 per­
cent generation tax, producing a total burden of 4 percent.
So the in-state burden -- I am referring to in-sta^e meaning

21
electricity generated and consumed in Mexico — the in-state
burden is 4 percent; the out-of-state is 2 percent.

Obviously

the burden on electricity, the in-state electricity is greater
than on the out-of-state electricity»
I want to emphasise that all generators in New Mexico
pay the tax.

It is not true that the tax is applied only to

out-of-state electricity, that is electricity generated in New
Mexico, moving outside the state.

Public Service Company and

everybody in New Mexico pays the tax as well.

They simply

are allowed to credit that energy tax, the generation tax
against their gross receipts tax liability.
QUESTION:

Does the record Indicate

whether Arizona

Public Service sells at retail any of its electricity in New
Mexico?
MPl0 UNNA:

A minor portion is sold to the company

that mines coal at the Four Corners Power Plant, and it is a
miniscule amount and basically I think that is all they sell
in New Mexico»

All of this electricity from the Four Corners

plant and the San Juan generating station, these two plants
in northwest New Mexico, al3 of that basically moves outside
the state except for Public Service Company of New Mexico and
El Paso Electric»

Those are two generators who also sell

electricity in New Mexico, a small portion of it»
Let me give the Court three hypothetical which will
I hope illustrate the non-discriminatory aspects of the tax.

22
In the first hypothetical, assume the state has a 2 percent
generation tax and no other taxes on electricity per se, and
that is obviously non-discriminatory because the 2 percent
tax applies to all electricity, no matter where it is sold.
In the second example, assume that the state later imposes a
sales tax of 2 percent, a flat 2 percent.

The total tax

burden on in-state electricity would then be H percent, and
the total tax burden on out-of-state electricity would be 2
percent, only the 2 percent generation tax.

Obviously, again,

the burden is greater on the in-state electricity than out-ofstate electricity, and it is non-discrlminatory.
In the third example, assume that the state had only
a sales tax and no generation tax, it later decides to add a
generation tax but does not want to raise the total tax
burden for in-state electricity so it allows that 2 percent
generation tax to be credited against its sales tax, and this
is not a hypothetical at all, it is actually New Mexico's
situation.

The total tax burden on in-state electricity is

still 4 percent, and the total tax burden on electricity
generated but marketed

and sold elsexvhere is still 2 per­

cent, and the burden is greater on in-state»
QUESTION:

Mr» Unna, you omit the possibility that

electricity sold elsewhere may be subject to a tax elsewhere»
MR. UNNA:

Under the constitutional ease law, that

is not relevant, in my reading of it, in any event»

The

23
inquiry is that a state’s structure ends at the borders of
the state that you are looking atc
QUESTION:

But it is true nevertheless,

MR„ UNNA:

What?

QUESTION:

That that electricity may be subject to a

tax at the retail level,
MR, UNNA:

Oh, of course,,

Of course,, a like burden,

QUESTION:

Isn’t it also true that so far as New

in fact.

Mexico generators of electricity go, those who generate or
that part of the electricity that they generate that is sold
inside of New Mexico is not subject to any generation tax and
that part of the electricity that the generators, the New
Mexico generators sell that is sold outside of the state is -MR. UNNA:

No, Your Honor, that is not true.

All

generators pay the tax —
QUESTION:

But those who generate electricity that

is sold in New Mexico get it back.
MRo UNNA:

They get the credit for it against their

gross receipts tax.
QUESTION:

They get it all back, don't they?

MR0 UNNA:

Yes, but they pay a higher tax0

QUESTION:

And those who sell electricity that is in

turn sold at retail outside of New Mexico don’t get it back0
MR. UNNA:

Not from New Mexico.

There is no way we

could give it back -—
QUESTION:

Prom anybody.

MR» UNNA:

Well,, they may get it from Arizona,, I

don’t know.
QUESTION:

But so far as New Mexico goes, the net

effect is that the sellers of electricity, the wholesale
sellers of electricity that in turn is sold in-state are not
taxed and those who sell electricity at retail out of state
are taxed, isn’t that correct?
MR» UNNA:

Or have I missed something?

No, you haven’t,,

The net effect of it

is trues but it is easy to slide over the fact that in-state
generators do actually pay this tax, the generation tax»
QUESTION:

Isn’t the net effect the test?

MR. UNNA:

The total tax burden under the constitu­

tional case law is the test.
QUESTION:

Not on all taxpayers in the states, the

total tax burden on a single taxpayers
MR. UNNA:

On the commodity, electricity.

QUESTION:

By a taxpayer»

Maybe five different

people pay taxes with respect to the commodity of electricity,
but you have to measure it by its affect on a taxpayer, don’t
you?
MR. UNNA:

I’m not sure that the case law says that

you couldn’t add up the total tax burden on different tax\

payers so long as it is on the commodity of electricity„

You

25
don’t have to have one single — as 1 read Public Utilities
District No0 2, the 873 case, Alaska v. Arctic Maid,, involving
fish and local eanners, it doesn't say that you have to have
one taxpayer and compare the burden on one taxpayers

You add

up the total tax burden on the commodity — in the Alaska v»
Arctic Maid, a 56l case. It was fish, local eanners versus one
out-of-state or interstate transaction»

You don't have to have

just one taxpayer»
As far as the record goes here with respect to whole­
sale sales, however, there is no factual record, for example,
that there is any In-state generator like Public Service
Company that even makes a wholesale sale»

As far as what is

being argued by the other side, that is basically an after­
thought because the record has no facts even to show that,
that there is even a wholesale — I presume, I don’t have the
facts either, that there are wholesale —

No, he pays mores Your Honor.

He pays a

gross receipts tax, and that is *} percent, yes, he does.
QUESTION:

The generator pays a 2 percent generation

tax that he gets back if the electricity is ultimately sold
inside the state, isn't that right?
MR, UNNA:

Yes, sir, but he gets it back against his

sales tax or gross receipts tax which he also pays»

That is a

^ percent tax burden.

MR. UNNA:

A sale by a New Mexico generator* is not

Is that correct?

MR. UNNA:

Yes.

QUESTION:

But the net result of a transaction is

that the electricity, each kilowatt hour that goes outside the
state pays a higher tax after the refund has been adjusted
than that consumed within the state, is that not correct?
MR, UNNA:

It's not correct.

The net result for

purposes of the constitutional case law is that a higher tax
is paid on in-state electricity.
QUESTION:

Well, let's forget what it is for, let's

just talk about the mathematics of it.
MR. UNNA:

All right.

QUESTION:

Does each kilowatt hour which goes across

the borders of the state into another place ultimately pay a
higher tax than that consumed within the state?
MR. UNNA:

No, Your Honor, it doesn't.

The elec­

tricity generated in New Mexico and sent to Arizona pays the
2 percent generation tax.

Electricity generated in New Mexico

and consumed in New Mexico pays the 2 percent generation tax,
that 2 percent generation tax is then credited against a

4

percent gross receipts tax, so that ultimately the total
burden on in-state electricity is

4

percent, the total burden

on out-of-state electricity is 2 percent, and under the

MR. UNNA:

That’s true.

There is an additional

burden as a result of the Electrical Energy Tax Act, and that
additional burden isnst shared by in-state electricity.

The

QUESTION:

So of the two power plants I described,

just one of them would really bear the entire burden of the
new tax, one sells out-of-state and one sells in-state,
MR® UNNA;

That3s right.

There is an additional tax

30
burden that is not shared by 'in-state electricity, but the
relevant — that is not the test under the constitutional case
law.

The constitutional ease law test is whether there is a

greater tax burden on the out-of-state electicity than on in­
state electricity, and the out-of-state electricity has moved
basically from sero to 2 percent.

They werenft paying any tax

before.
QUESTION:

Well, is your position basically that New

Mexico's tax is not all that different from the use tax that
states devised in the thirties to make up for lost revenue in
a situation that they couldn’t get by sales taxes?
MR. UNNA:

That is basically it, yes.

In those

cases, those are equivalent taxes, say, a 4 percent use tax
and a 4 percent sales tax.

Here the tax burden is even greater

on in-state electricity, it is 4 percent versus 2 percent.
The equivalence of taxation rule allows a state to do exactly
what New Mexico has done in restructuring its taxation with
respect to electricity.
QUESTION:

Mr. Unna, perhaps I am wrong, but isn't

the distinction really on what one looks at?

If one looks at

the energy tax in isolation, it is discriminatory.

If one

looks at the entire burden, according to your approach, it is
non-disc^iminatory.
MR. UNNA:

Yes.

Your Honor, the ease law Is very

clear, that you are not to look at — as I read the eases, one

31
is not to look at the tax in isolation, one is to add up the
total tax burden.
QUESTION:

How about just looking at wholesalers?

How about looking at the entire tax burden on wholesalers of
energy?
MR. UNNA:

Well, if you look solely at the tax

burden on a generator and a 'wholesaler, all geneators and
wholesalers pay the tax.

The in-state generator and whole­

saler actually pays the tax, too.
QUESTION:

tricity.
QUESTION:

The wholesaler does?

MR® UNNA:

Yes.

QUESTION:

The higher tax is imposed on the ultimate

consumer, isn? t it?
MR. UNNA:

Not in our state. Your Honor,

It is im­

posed on the same Public Service Company or the retailer of

in Mew Mexico.

MRo UNNA:

Yes.

That is speculative.

There is

nothing in the record to indicate that there is such a person.
QUESTION:

Well, is it just natural to assume that

there isn’t?
MR. UNNA:

No, but the record is silent, it wasn't a

point that was developed by the utilities in this case.

It was

?r. ■

never tried in the lower court, in the trial court.

If the

case wasn’t tried, the case was submitted on cross motions
for summary judgment, but there is no factual information on
a discrimination against wholesalers.

To my way of thinking,

the argument about discrimination against wholesalers assumes
the very proposition of discrimination that we are arguing
about, because they would have — you have assumed that the
tax burden on in-state generators is aero and there is still
a 4 percent gross receipts tax burden.

That is not the case.

The tax burden on in-state generators is in fact still 2 per­
cent.

There is an equivalent tax burden of generators, and

then we9 ve in effect only lowered, our gross receipts tax.

QUESTION:

MR0 UNNA:

Right.

QUESTION:

Mr. Unna, could I focus on section 391

for a minute.

Isn’t that right?

When that came out of the Senate, is there any

question that it concededly was aimed to invalidate New
Mexico’s tax?
MR. UNNA:

There is no question that it is aimed at

Invalidating New Mexico’s tax.
QUESTION:

Well, what legislative history is there

in connection with that statute to suggest that the Congress’
adoption of the phrase "greater tax burden" signaled a design
to shift the focus of the discrimination inquiry into the
state tax system as a whole?
MRo UNNA:

I don’t know that the Senate Finance --

the Senate Finance Committee version, there was a great dif­
ference I think in the — well, not a great difference, there
was a difference between the Senate Finance Committee version
and the greater tax burden version.

proponents of the test had a problem in that they couldn’t

test of discrimination to invalidate New Mexico's tax, if
they would have hurt Washington and West Virginia.
QUESTION;

And you think because of the West

Virginia barrier you had a completely different result then
as to New Mexico than when it left the Senate?
MR* UNNA:

No, I think they had to water down the

test so substantially, however, that it resulted in a restate­
ment of the case law, and the test of discrimination in the
second part of section 391 1 think makes that very clear.
QUESTION:

And Nev? Mexico benfits accordingly?

Of course, if

it is a restatement, then

our tax is constitutional and if it is a restatement under
the constitutional case law, there is no question that New
Mexico5s tax structure would survive Intact*
QUESTION:

Does it make some difference in this

case whether the business of generating and selling electrical

ence between the two?

36
MR. UNNA:
ence.

No, I don’t think it makes any differ­

I don’t quite understand the thrust of your question,,
QUESTION:

Well,, my thought is that our cases have

said the practicalities influence a great deal whether a tax
is discriminatory or not- and. x«?ho bears the burden and that
sort of thing.

And if in fact the concept of someone x*ho

wholesales electricity does not loom large in the business
of the generation and distribution of electrical energy,
should that play any part in our decision as compared to a
situation where there are three identifiable tiers, a manu­
facturer, a wholesaler and a retailer?
MR. UNNA:

Well, I think that wholesaling doesn’t

play a large part in the distribution of electricity.

In the

record, in response to our interrogatory, there are some
answers about wholesaling of electricity amongst the plain­
tiffs and among in-state utilities, but those are economy
interchanges, simply one utility gets low and needs more
electricity, it takes some more of one of the other’s as part
of the power pool.

But there is no record here basically on

wholesaling of electricity, and to my knowledge basically we
have in-state generators who also retail and -QUESTION:

Do you have an REA in your state?

MR. UNNA:

No, we don't.

You don't.

There are some

federal power lines, but the REA to my knowledge is not in

that the producing state has to suffer all the environmental

they are, and that that Justified a different treatment for
the electrical energy which was exported where the consumers
would not have to suffer the subject of these environmental
disadvantages.

QUESTION:

Stick with my question, if you don’t

mind, counsel»
MR. UNNA:

Sure.

QUESTION:

Do you argue that the state in which the

generator is located puts up with a lot of burdens that the

38
consuming state or the Republic of Mexico doesn't have to
suffer?
MRo UNNA:

Oh, yes*

QUESTION:

And if so, that would appear to mean

that you are undertaking to justify a differential treatment
between in-state and out-of-state consumption*
MR. UNNA;

X}m not saying we can discriminate be­

cause there is so much pollution*
QUESTION:

Then what is the argument for?

MR. UNNA:

Well, to show nexus with the taxing state,

that there were a tremendous amount of costs and benefits to
the utilities as a result of having their plants in the north­
west corner of New Mexico, just to set the case in context*
It was submitted on cross motions for summary judgment and we
wanted to make sure that it was well established at the trial
level that there was nexus sufficient for taxing purposes.
QUESTION:

Mr. Unna, let me ask you a question about

the legislative history of the statute, with specific reference
to West Virginia.

Do I correctly understand that the differ­

ence between the West Virginia generating tax and the tax
that we have before us here is in West Virginia there was no
credit against any gross receipts tax?
MR. IJNNA:

No, you are correct.

In West Virginia,

it is a tax on the gross proceeds of electricity*
QUESTION:

Committee version of higher gross or net tax would sweep up

so the tax then was —
QUESTION:

The fear was based on the fact that the

total tax burden might be taken to include taxes imposed by
neighboring states on the retail sale, is that the Idea,
whereas West Virginia had no gross receipts tax?
MR. UNNA:

No, I think the fear was simply using the

word ”gross c"
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. UNNA:

Gross, it would have swept up the gross

proceeds tax, it would have said that the burden is higher„
The test was significantly changed though to put in the
greater tax burden language on electricity, and that is
straight out of the ease law.
QUESTION:

That is the case law test for --

There is a significant difference between

West Virginia and New Mexico, is the absence in that state of
the credit against It?
ME. UNNA:

Yes«

But the higher gross or net tax

language seemed to focus on a credit situation such as New
Mexico’s and look at a generation tax in isolation, and then
when that language was abandoned, higher gross or net tax,
we moved straight to the greater tax burden test which is
precisely the constitutional test, and that is why I say it is

a restatement.
QUESTION:

Taking the analogy a step further, if we

go back to my hypothetical of two power plants in the Four
Corners area, one selling out-of-state and one selling in­
state, if you had followed what — if you had done what West
Virginia did, both would have paid the 2 percent tax without
any credit?
MR. UNNA:

Yesu

I think West Virginia had a tax on

a different level of distribution, but under the total tax
burden test that wouldn’t make any difference, and so I think
— also I am not familiar with West Virginia’s tax situation
exactly, but 1 think the rate of taxes for the two different
plants was slightly different0

I think that the in-state

burden was greater than — that is, using your two plants
example, the one plant producing in-state electricity would
have been at a higher tax burden than the one going outside
the state.
QUESTION:

Is that because there is another tax in

addition to the generating tax?
MRo UNNA:

Yes, I think there were two tax systems

there involved., but that is also our easeo
The difference between the Senate Finance Committee
version and the final form of the test, the greater tax burden
test is significant because that is the operative test of
discrimination under section 3910

And if you changed the test

41
of discriminations you have changed the whole ball game as
far as discrimination goes.
It is also important in the legislative history of
section 391 that nowhere does it repudiate the constitutional
case law test of discrimination.

So we end up with two tests

of discrimination existing side by side, supposedly one in
391 is a new test, but its language is couched in terms of
the constitutional case law test; moreover, it doesn’t repudi­

Mr. McAluffe, do you have

anything further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL J. McAULIFFEs ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL
MR. McAULIFFE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

A few

very brief points.
Mr’. Justice Blarlmun, if I might clarify one thing.
They do not have those two letters after the bill leaves the
Senate.

Those two letters are both at least a month and a

half prior to the debate on the Senate floor, the letters In
the appendix.
The state asks us to entertain several assumptions
as a basis for justifying the tax.

The first is that we

should assume that there are no wholly intrastate New Mexico
wholesalers.

The problem with that, may it please the Court,

is that if there are no wholly New Mexico intrastate whole­
salers, then why is section 9(C) in the Act?

And in our

treatment of the legislative history before the state legis»
lature, it is very clear that what «°» which is set forth in
our opening brief — that what they were concerned with was
the fact that an intrastate wholesaler, which plenty of them

exist, could not take advantage of the section 9(B) credits»
So obviously the New Mexico legislature was legislating to
take care of a specific situation which did in fact exist®
The second assumption they ask us to entertain is
that New Mexico has in fact passed some different tax, that
they have in effect reduced their sales tax to 2 percent and
imposed a generation tax even-handedly»

1 think we have

adequately shown that that is not in fact what they have done
and we cannot save this tax by referring to some hypothetical
tax which New Mexico might have enacted but concededly did
not»
The final assumption is that the constitutional case
law establishes an equivalence of tax rule»

I think that is

an over-statement in —

the energy tax, the New Mexico Intrastate wholesalers„

What

is bothering me at the moment is that memory does not serve
me as to whether they identify particular intrastate wholesalers to whom they are
QUESTION;

'crying to protect.

They save them from the tax and they

don't pay the gross receipts tax?
MR. McAULIPFE;

Not on the wholesale transaction*

that is correct, the gross receipts; tax will not apply to a
wholesale transaction»
QUESTION:

Was this wholesale argument that you are

making now made to the New Mexico Supreme Court?
MR a McAULIPFE:

Yes0 it was, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

and it was not dealt with in the opinion of the court below»
That concludes my treatment of the final assumption*
which is that we only look at the facial tax equivalence.
The rule is that taxpayers pay taxes, and we look at the
treatment of individual taxpayers, similarly situated

48
taxpayers.

That is what Halliburton says.

And when we look

at similarly situated taxpayers in this case at the wholesale
level, again under the constitutional test, as the state
advocates it to be, this tax is discriminatory*
If there are no further questions, Mr* Chief Justice,
I will —
QUESTIGN;

Mr. McAuliffe, may I ask one other ques­

tion.
MR* McAULIFFE:
QUESTION;

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Could the state come out about the same

and would you agree that it would be constitutional to do it
this way, to impose the 2 percent generation tax on both the
ln~state and out-of-state sellers and to reduce the gross
receipts tax across the board to 2 percent?

That would have

been constitutional, I suppose.
MR* McAULIPFE;

I suppose -- I have never focused

specifically on that question*

1 think it would remove the

credit provision in the discriminatory treatment of which we
complain at the present time.
QUESTION;

The dollars would probably come out about

the same, wouldn®t they?
MR. McAULlFFE:

Again, I am not sure of that,

I

have never tried to cost that out.
QUESTION:

Thank you*

MR. McAULIPFE;

I believe my time is expired. Mr*

Chief Justice.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:00 o’clock aamOJ) the ease in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
