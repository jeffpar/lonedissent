P R o C E E E I N G a
MR,, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 73-690, Reiter against Sonotone Corporation,
et al,
Mr. Thomas, you may proceed whenever you are ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN E0 THOMAS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR* THOMAS:

Mr» Chief Justice» may it please this

Hon ora b 1 e Court:
My name is John Thomas.
Sfc. Paul, Minnesota»

I am a sole pracfcicioner from

I have ceded ten minutes of my argument

time to the Federal Government, so I have twenty minutes.

I in­

tend to try and keep possibly five for rebuttal.
And what I would like to do is --First of all, the
issue this morning that we are faced with is whether or not
consumers in the United States may recover overcharges paid for
price-fixed goods as injury occurred, under Section 4 of the
Clayton Act,in their property.
I will quickly outline my argument points, if I may,
<

please.
First of all, I would like to classify the Eighth
Circuit opinion as one of policy, contrary to the warnings of
this Court in antitrust decisions.
Secondly, we will look at the statute language,
exactly what it does say, which I say is in the disjunctive.

4

Then* 1 would like to go to the opinions of this Court*
starting with Mr, Justice Holmes in Chattanooga Foundry* through
Mr. Justice Marshall in Hawaii v, Standard Oil* and then through
each one of the Justices here* what they said in Pfizer v,
government of India *
Lastly* 1 would then like to describe* if I may* for
the Court* what I see the result of the Eighth Circuit’s opinion
being* which Is a severely added complication to the Antitrust
Laws* the destruction of the parens patriae legislation* both
for the states and the private opt-out provision in that legis­
lation* and finally the elevation of foreign governments to a
preferred position over American citizens.
First of all* policy.

I think if we look at the

Eighth Circuit opinion* it concludes* "We think it is sensible
as a matter of policy,"

To me* this is in direct conflict with

this Court's warning in U.S, v. Cooper Corpa* where this Court
said, "It is not for the courts to indulge in the business of
policy-making in the field of antitrust legislation,"
This Court has said many times* St, Paul Fire and
Marine case and Blue Shield of Texas* and so forth* that the
starting point in any case involving statute language is the
statute language Itself,
Lai's look at that.

Section IV of the Clayton Act

reads* "Any person who shall be injured in his business or
property* by reason of anything forbidden in the Antitrust Laws*

5
shall recover."

It is the business or property —*

QUESTION:

Why didn't Congress simply say, "Any person

injuredrather than "injured in his business or property"?
MR, THOMAS:
Section 7 Amendment*

Well* Your Honor* that’s Senator Orr’s
I guess* to Senator Sherman’s initial

proposal* which I believe did basically read that way.
Orr said* "There is no change®

Senator

It is well understood" -- his

amendment* his change to "business or property."

So, I would

say that it reads the same way.
The dictionary* Black’s Law Dictionary* of course,
says "or" is in the disjunctive* and Mr. Justice Rehnquist* I
will touch back oh that a little more directly.

I am coming to

it.
Legal scholars.

All of them who have touched on this*

who have considered this question* all of them through Professor
Sullivan* Professor Berk* all of them say that it is in the dis­
junctive,. "business or property," and the consumers have standing
to recover for money paid for price-fixed goods.
Professor Sullivan says that Mr. Justice Holmes noted
it was in the disjunctive.

Judge Wyzanski, In referring to this

Court, said that Congress and the courts have frequently shown
i1... i,

they regard the Sherman Act as an economic charter of freedom of
hardly less than constitutional dimensions.

It deserves un-

grudging and as sometimes said liberal reading to accomplish its
purposes

6
Mow-! this Court, in Pfizer v( India, where Mr* Justice
dtewarfc wrote the majority opinion with Justices Brennan, White,
Marshall and Stevens, said this, "The Petitioners argue that the
Antitrust Laws were intended to protect only American consumers*"
And those Justices, who are here this morning, concluded* "Clearly,
therefore. Congress did not intend to make the treble-damage
remedy" «» and 1 am going to hammer on that term "remedy" —
"available only to consumers in our country»"
That was what the majority said*
The dissent, written by Mr. Chief Justice Burger, with
Justices Powell and Rehnquist, said this:

"As this Court ob­

served last term, the legislative history of the treble-damage
remedy which dees exist" — quoting from Brunswick now -- ''in­
dicates that it was conceived of primarily as a remedy for the
people of the United States as individuals, especially con­
sumers ."
And then, this is the language of the three judges,
"What we so recently saw as primarily a remedy for American con­
sumers, is now extended to all nations of the world," and that
was the cause for the dissent,
Mr, Justice Powell, who wrote a separate dissent,
noted the all-important case of Georgia v. Evans, where the
State of Georgia bought asphalt for its roads, was a consumer.
And Mr* Justice Powell apparently saw no direct legislative
history, but he said this in Georgia y. Evans, "A clear policy

7
fco protect the States of the Union was reflected in the Anti­
trust Laws and in the legislative history/'
The Court could perceive no reason for believing that
Congress wanted to deprive a state* substitute consumer here* as
purchaser of commodities shipped in interstate commerce* of the
civil remedy -** there's that term "remedy" again -- of treble
damages which is available to other purchasers who suffer through
violation of the Act.
Those are the words of all the Justices here* those
three.
Now* remedy -- we come back to that term "remedy"»»
legislative history.

We can go right back to Senator Hoar* where

he* in 1890* raised this question.

He said to Senator Sherman.,

he asked Sherman if the purpose was to give private citizens
a civil remedjr in the courts.
Senator Sherman replied* "Certainly.

The second

section gives a private remedy to every person injured."
Now* this Court in U.S. v. Cooper Corp.* cited and
relied on that and said in U.S. v. Cooper* "Private purchaser
is given a remedy under the Antitrust Laws,"
In Footnote 10* of the Brunswick Corporation v. Pueblo
3owl~Q-Mat* this Court again considered what legislative history
there is and concluded* "It is a remedy* especially for con­
sumers and it is opening the door of justice to every man."
And that's why we are here this morning.

8
The result of the Eighth Circuit is this, as I see it.
And that's why I ask this Court to reverse.
Defendants define property.

They say fchlss

"This

Sourfc should now hold that property is this," they say, "a
commercial pursuit or interest unconnected with one's business
or primary livelihood,"
We have heard Judge Wyzanskl say what this Court has
said over the years, that the Sherman Act is of constitutional
proportions.

This type of definition belongs in the Internal

Revenue Code, as we all know, from that code.

This is the type

of thing you get there, where we would fight over "Is it con­
nected, is it unconnected with one’s business?

What is the

primary lJ-’eIihood? "
Their definition — as a -private/antitrust practiciener
-- it would turn it in to.«a three-ring circus.

Arad I used to be

a tax lawyer many years ago.
QUESTION:

Mr. Thomas, you suggest that the wordsr

"business or property" are used in the disjunctive.

Do you

suggest they have different meanings?
MR. THOMAS:

Yes, Your Honor, in my brief, I believe,

and I know it was repeated in the amicus.

I am not sure if it

Is in my petition or my brief, but the labor exemption, under
the Che man Act, defined — That’s the only place where we see
"property" and "business" defined separately.
ally, equals dominion over something.

Property, basic­

Business really equals

9
what your time is spent on in the game,
QUESTION:
always business?

Well, if this is property, isn't property

Could you ever be injured in your business

without also being injured in your property?
MR, THOMAS:

Yes, I would say it does have to be a

commercial transaction in our market place, in our free enter­
prise, competitive society.
Where it is just general destruction to trees, for
example, from pollution, no.

Aesthetics, recreation type of

activities *>QUESTION:

You mean, a conspiracy, somehow or other,,

oy slowing down scientific progress, or something like that,
cause damage to a lot of trees, that wouldn't be injury to
property?
MR, THOMAS:
QUESTION:
MR, THOMAS:
QUESTION:

Yes, but not —
Not to business?
Yes, exactly.
But what if you are a lumber company,

wouldn't that be an injury to your business then?
MR„ THOMAS:

Then we get into the target area question,

your Honor, which Judge Larson did describe and did find here.
If it is caused by oil companies f ixing the price of gasoline,
driving down the highway -~
QUESTION:

Well, maybe it isn't that important, but

I just didn’t quite understand how one could have an injury to

10

his business that was not also an injury to property,
MR, THOMAS:

Oh* an injury to business* not an injury

to property?
QUESTION:

That was not also, under your theory, clearly

also an Injury to property* and so I wonder how significant the
3isjunctive is.
MR. THOMAS:

Oh* Your Honor* I guess what you are

saying is that If it affects you on the balance sheet it is
money and it causes a decrease.

I was thinking of that yesterday*

Your Honor* again and generally*1 guess* everything goes to the
bottom line in our business society* and that ie a tough one.
So long as you are in business* 1 guess that would be a property
damage.
QUESTION:

Mr. Thomas* suppose that in the course of

an antitrust conspiracy* someone like your client sho is not
in business is slandered,

ho you think that would be an ..njury

to her property?
MR. THOMAS:
business.

Mo* absolutely not.

You have to be in

There are many antitrust cases that do hold that -»

In fact* X have one file.* myself* "business slander" -- is com»
pensible under the Antitrust Laws.
consumer* no.

But not for an individual

They would have to be involved in a business

pursuit* yes*sir.
The result* as I see it —
Oh* and the trilogy of cases decided by Judge Williams

11
out in California-- If you read those, you will see one in par­
ticular *>« This is a further complication that will come up.
He anguished.

He felt he might be creating a Franklnstein

monster here* because he said* ’’Suppose a woman goes and buys
two dresses, one to use in putting on an opera for profit, the
second one to go out to an anniversary dinner with her husband.
The first one is subject to compensation under the Antitrust Laws,
the second one, apparently, not.

And he was in anguish over

that and saying, in effect, "What am I doing?
Ninth Circuit.

Help me out, Supreme Court,"

Help me out,
And Judge Nickerson

said in the Theophil case, in New York — He said what he hoped
this Court would hold, "The Ninth Circuit has reserved opinion."
The Eighth Circuit has destroyed the parens patriae
legislation because it is derivative for the states as to the
actions of consumers,

They are representing consumers.

Secondly -- here is an interesting point — the
parens patriae legislation has an opt out provision, an opt
out provision for private parties.

Mow, that would be if this

Court doesn't reverse the Eighth Circuit, that would be like :•
pilot announcing at thirty thousand feet, "This plane is in
trouble, ladies and gentlemen.

You all, of course, are free
M

to ball out, but obviously we have no parachutes."
mo you see what I am saying?

The opt out provision

is noting out into nothing, under the parens patriae, unless
there is a private right of action for that person.

I

Foreign governments, as they now stand, combining this
decision by the Eighth Circuit with the decision in Pfizer ve
Government of India, foreign governments are not preferred over
American citizens, in that foreign governments buy price-fixed
goods from Defendants, supply them to their citizens.
it is antibiotics, let's'say it's hearing aids.

Let's say

Turn around and

American citizens buy those same fixed-price goods from the
defendant, the foreign governments can come in and have standing
before this Court, because the eighth Circuit,in their opinion
to get around Mr. Justice Holmes in Chattanooga Foundry, the
Eighth Circuit said that that was a business injury, arguably a
business injury.
And you'd better believe that foreign governments will
be in here arguing, obviously, that in every Instance it's a
business injury for them, supplying water, supplying hearing
aids, supplying antibiotics«>

But what about American citizens?

Surely they may come before this Court.
That was the only way the Eighth Circuit really got
around Mr. Justice Holmes.

I see no way of getting around him.

He really saw this and defined it.
These are my main points that I wish to touch on, to
hit on.

And I am keenly interested if the Court has any par­

ticular area —
QUESTION:

The only question I have, Mr. Thomas;

uo

you think the Illinois Brick case has anything to do with this

13

:;ase?
MR. THOMAS:
Etonor, no»

The question here this morning* Your

I am the counsel in Beckers --You may or may not know

that — the case that was just denied cert.

It has nothing here*

but of course the first thing I am going to be hit with when we
;;o back is an Illinois Brick motion* and I think that this Court
if it saw fit in its wisdom — there is a footnote.

That is to

me purely a question of law that could be decided, in that pass
on is not in this case.

It is a retail price~fixing question»

.And, therefore, as a matter of law Illinois Brick does not apply»
But the defendants have said in their brief that they are going
to bring an Illinois Brick motion as soon as we get back down.»
anticipating reversal by this Court.
So, yes, it does, Your Honor, but-not here this
morning, directly.
Is there any other area that anybody -MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Apparently no questions at

this stage, Mr. Thomas.
MR, THOMAS:

Thank you, very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Shenefield.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. SHENEFIELD# fiiQ.,
ON BEHALF OF UN IT EE STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. SHENEFIELU:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In deciding, as it did, that the consumer has

14

Insufficient standing, that it has not been injured in its prop­
erty, the Eighth Circuit, at least as to the retail trades in
this country, created an antitrust exemption, except for the
Government.
One point three trillion dollars of commerce, nearly
50$ of the gross national product of this country, would be re­

moved from the effects of private treble damage actions.

And that

facts remains in spite of the thrust of the legislative history,
in spite of the clear meaning of the language, in my view, in
spite of the language used by this Court in many recently de­
cided cases, and in spite of the obvious policy purposes of the
treb3.e damage remedy.
For commerce at the retail level, the Court of Appeals
simply deprives antitrust enforcement altogether of the benefit
and assistance of private policing and the private attorneys
general.

And in so doing, the Court of Appeals, 1 think, does

violence to the twin policy purposes that this Court has ascribed
to private antitrust enforcement, compensation and deterrencecompensation, because the only victims of the anti­
trust violation, at the retail level, are unable to sue.
deterrence, because the violations and the violators of the anti­
trust laws simply do not have to be concerned about the threat
of private suits,

Indeed, it could be argued that antitrust

violations would be encouraged by this ruling if it were gener­
alized, because a violator, rather than having to anticipate that

15

ne would be deprived of the fruits of the illegality.. In fact.,
sould count on garnering,, storing up* retention of the fruits of
antitrust violation.
Now* analysis begins with the language of the statute.
Injury alone* Mr, Justice Rehnquist, would not be enough.

That

is the standard under Section 16 of the Clayton Act for anticipa­
tory injunctive relief.

But the legislative history makes clear.,

I believe* that in formulating a remedy and requiring a proof
of standing in order to achieve right of damages* there had to
have been some kind of injury to business or property* that is
injury to a commercial interest* not a business interest.
QUESTION:

What does business or property exclude that

would not have been excluded if it simply used the word "injured'?
MR, SHLN.dFI.~Ld:

Physical injury* injury to reputation*

injury of a non-commercial nature that did not implicate the
parties commercial interests.

And we strongly believe that a

consumer who makes a purchase in the open market has a commercial
interest.
Now* Mr, Justice dtevens* you can injure business* in
my view, without injuring property.
denying business opportunity,.

You can Injure business by

An exclusive dealing*arrangement*'

for instance,* in violation of the Antitrust Laws* might not in­
jure a plaintiff in his property* but could conceivably injure
his business by a denial of business opportunity.
QUESTION:

If such a violation occurred* wouldn't it

16

make business less valuable and, therefore, hurt his property?
I don't know that this is crucial, but it does -MR, SH-jN.1FI.13X' :

I agree.

You would not have to prove

it, in my view, in order to have standing to sue against the anti
trust viola tion»
QUESTION:

Presumably, if you are suing under lection

4, you are trying to get some money,

You have to prove actual

damages in order to have something to treble,
MR, SHONYFIfli):

You have to have a foregone business

opportunity that was calculable, thafc5s correct,
QUi-STIQN:

I gather that you can be injured in your

property without being injured in your business?
MR, SHONJFIJ.^:

That's the essence —
/

QUESTION:

That's this case,

MR, SHililFI^Lu:

That's this case and that's the

essence of this Court's decision in the Chattanooga case in
1906.

It Is the essence of the decision in Pfizer, where the

foreign government was not in any business, as such,
QUESTION:

And the property interest here is being

deprived of too much money?
MR, SHfN.JFIEID:

The property interest is in being

overcharged, having money diminished as the result of violation
of the Antitrust Laws, as the Court described in the Chattanooga
case.
The disjunctive, in my view, was put there with a

17

purpose to offer alternative grounds for plaintiffs to reach the
courthouse door.

This Plaintiff reaches the courthouse door be­

cause she had her property diminished as the result cf an over­
charge.
The legislative history, I think -- There are bits and
pieces of it that the Court of Appeals has cited.
and pieces of it in all of the briefs.

There are bits

1 think the fairest thing

to be said about the legislative history is that many of the
legislators believed that the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act
were enacted to assist consumers in the fights as they put it,
against the monopoly profits of the trusts of the day.

Many, of

course, also were concerned about the small business competitors.
No one suggested in the debates that consumers were ousted, that
consumers would be unable to apply to the Court for remedy.

The

sole debate in the legislature, as nearly as anyone can tell, was
about the degree of effectiveness of those remedies, whether or
not they went far enough.

But no one suggested that there was

not an antitrust consumer remedy there.
QUESTION:

When you say "consumer" you mean ultimate

purchaser?
MR. SHBNBFImli';

In this case, an ultimate purchaser,

a direct purchaser in this case.

Illinois Brick is not impli­

cated in this case because you have a direct purchaser.

But

a consumer, it seems to me, in common parlance, most often means
direct purchaser

18

QUESTION:

Well, the Illinois Brick issue is not here,

is it?
MR, SHENEFIELU:

That’s correct.

It's not here be­

cause the Court of Appeals didn't decide it.
QUESTION:

There is a difference of opinion as to its

applicability, as you know.
MR, SHENEFIEIiJ:
purchaser.

But this Plaintiff was a direct

The rationale of Illinois Brick —
QUESTION:

Well, the issue here is not an Illinois

Brick. issue?
MR, SHENEFIJUD:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Given the understanding of the reach of the

Commerce Clause in 1890 by the people who enacted the law, it
is really sort of unrealistic to talk about whether they
actually thought about this particular kind of action.
probably why they didn’t discuss it very much.

That's

Again., that may

not be dispositive here.
-MR* ^HENEPIu:-w:

They didn't discuss class actions,

obviously, but there is language in the debates of discussing
consumer actions, individual rights, the rights of individuals
to recover,
QUESTION:

It has taken quite a bit of time for that

to surface, hasn’t it?
MR, SHENEPEiLE:

It was not until Rule 23, and until

the class action procedure was developed it simply wasn’t an

19

effective remedy for an individual,
QUESTION:

-accept for large purchasers,

MR„ SHJNjiF'Liuj:
QUESTION:

Very large consumersP that is correct,

Like municipalities or foreign governments,

MR, SHlNiSFLLLD:

That's correct.

But antitrust in general is regarded as having been
designed to promote consumer welfare through the protection of
the competitive process,

This Court described it as "better

products at lower prices" in Northern Pacific,
It simply cannot have been the purpose of Congress in
formulating a treble damage remedy, in aid of consumer welfare,
po deny that remedy to the very person that the laws were de­
signed to protect in the first place.
In Chattanooga, which is controlling in this case,
the Court held that the city there was a buyer of goods, as is
Reiter in this case,
Chattanooga paid more for those goods as the result of
an antitrust violation, as did Reiter in this case. Chattanooga's
property was diminished as a result of that overcharge.

And so,

too, was Reiter's property diminished in this case it is alleged.
The Court held that Chattanooga, therefore was injured
in its property and could come into court under Section 4.
Does it really make sense to think of Chattanooga, a
consumer, a city that has standing to corae into court entitled
to re-cover, or even a foreign government as a consumer entitled

20

fco recover, and not admit U.S, citizens, American citizens, into
court as consumers entitled to recover?
There is nothing that rules that cut in the eighth
Circuit opinion»

Indeed, its whole suggestion is that consumers

simply do not have an adequate interest in prosecuting and in
suing antitrust violations to be permitted to come into court*
The legislative history, the language of the statute,
the words of this Court and, above all, the policy purposes of
the private treble damage remedy under the Antitrust Laws all
argue strongly for permitting citizens to come into court as
consumers„
QUESTION:

Mr. Shenefield, it just ran through my

mind that — You say, "Does it make any sense?"

-- Did it make

any sense for Congress to say, in substance, if a citizen has a
claim that is worth over $10,000, he can raise a federal question
in federal court, but if he only has a $10 claim he may not,, and
yet 'they did just that»
MR» SHDNuRXDJi):

I would hate to be examined on which

aspect of congressional utterances made sense and which did nofee
QUESTION:

But there is a difference, I suppose, a

practical difference between a suit by a city for $1 million
pipe purchase and a $10 purchase by an individual.
MR.

:

It seems to me that if you have no

plaintiffs here, if you have a retail sale in which there was an
antitrust violation and there is no plaintiff whatsoever, that

21

you come inevitably fco the conclusion that Congress simply could
not have intended that kind of a situation.
QUESTION:

So you recall* Mr. Shenef ield* the legis­

lation that was introduced within recent years* two* three at
most* that was called the’toothpaste amendment" because one of
the illistrations was that all of the consumers of a particular
brand of toothpaste could tack their claims,, mass their claims
at 75 cents per tube and achieve federal jurisdiction under the
same concept you are presenting here today?

That was rejected

by the Congress* or at least it was not enacted.

Are you familiar

with that?
MR. SH-N^Liir:
QUESTION:

1 am not.

It was called the "toothpaste amendment"

because that8s the way the debate in the Congress evolved,
MRo feHiSNhFLlD:

The most recent congressional utter-

t
ance on this subject* specifically* that we know about is the
Parens Patriae Amendments in 1976* where

at least this Court

found a new procedural, device for achieving old and existing
substantive righto was being created.
QUESTION:

Do you see any basic difference between

massing the claims* tacking the claims of consumers of tooth­
paste and doing so with reference to hearing aids or electric
toothbrushes*, or what not?
MR, oHENEFIEmQ:

Whether or not there is a philos­

ophical difference* in my view* there is a clear legal difference.

22

because of the statute and the scheme of enforcement of the anti
trust laws., where the private remedy was designed to promote en­
forcement a to supplement enforcement# where it was more than
simply a compensatory device# where the deterrent effect of en­
forcement —
QUESTION:

Wouldn't there be a deterrent effect if X

millions of people were allowed a 10 cent toothpaste rebate?
You would have no difficulty with the jurisdictional aspect if
you could mass them»

1 have difficulty seeing the difference

between what is being advanced here.

If your view prevails you

wouldn't need an amendment to the statute to mass toothpaste
claims# would you. or toothbrush claims?
MR* ijHxNXFIiiXI. ;

I don't think — I am not familiar

with the proposed amendment# but I don't think that amendment
could have been in the context of the Antitrust Laws.
QUESTION:

Wall# there is no jurisdictional limita­

tion# minimum# on private antitrust action#
MRo SEXNfcFI-JU):

is there?

That's correct»

The parens patriae legislation assumed that there did
exist a substantive right of recovery for consumers.. And the
parens patriae legislation# if the Eighth Circuit's opinion is
affirmed and is generalized# the parens patriae legislation ia
entirely visciafced because there will be no consumer right of
recovery.
Thank you# very much

MR o CHUF JUSTICE BURG JR:

Very well.

Mr, Attorney Genera2.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP WARRRN SPANNAUS , JSQ „ f,
on behalf of rtatr of

MRo SPANNAUS:

Alabama, rt al., as amici curiar

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courfc:
The states are interested in this case because of the
state's increasing role in antitrust law enforcement.

The

..anguage of Section 4, the legislative history and the over»
whelming weight of the case law supports
standing.

nonbusiness consumer

But even more importantly, the existence of non-»

business consumer standing Is important in the overall schema
of antitrust law enforcement.

The threat of treble damages is

a.strong, indeed the strongest, threat against antitrust viola­
tions.

Penial of standing of private purchasers would certainly

reduce the number of treble damage actions.

This would defeat

the two major purposes of Section 4, to deter violators, and de­
prive them of the right to keep their illegal profits, and,two,
to compensate victims for their injuries,
states recognize the importance of nonbusiness con­
sumer standings.

Criminal prosecutions and government civil

actions certainly are not a sufficient deterrent.

Public

agencies do not have the ability to bring every possible action.
The Justice department can only bring about sixty to a hundred
cases a year, and the states are severely and similarly restricted.

24

The lower court exhibited a strong dislike toward
private consumer action, saying that they were either coercive
by nature, or many times nonmeritorious.

States disagree with

this and the Congress has disagreed.
Affirmance of the Eighth Circuit opinion would elimin­
ate all nonbusiness consumer actions.

Certainly there are many

cases when private parties can bring a lawsuit on their own, and
there are many cases when a class would be small ehough to be
manageable.

For example, a conspiracy to fix real estate prices

on residential homes in a particular area could give a small
group of individuals enough economic incentive to bring an
action on their own, or an individual who .purchases a large
quantity of goods or a large quantity of a single item over a
long period of time, for example, a life maintenance drug, might
have the incentive to bring an action on his own, individually.
The remedy for a nonmanageable class is the refusal
bo certify the classes,

And the remedy for a nonmeri tori ous

action is either dismissal or summary judgment.
Next, we would like to discuss the parens issue that
was raised here a few minutes ago.

Ideally, the parens patriae

authority should not be an issue in this case,

However, we would

hope that this Court would not rely on the parens issue, as did
the Eighth Circuit, to deny private rights.

The parens issue

was not meant to be a substitute for all private actions.
was meant to be a supplement and not a replacement.

It

Making

25

parens the exclusive remedy would certainly — was not the in-»
tenfcion of Congress when they passed the Antitrust Improvement
Act of 1976.
QUr_,iTlJN:

When you say parens, Mr, £pannaus,do you mean

parens patriae?
MR, hPANNAUS:
QUiSSTIJN:

Yes. sir,

excuse me, Mr. Justice,

It's derivative, isn't it?

I mean, if we

were to hold that the consumers had no right here, it would
rather significantly diminish the scope of fcha parens patriae.
MR. SPANNAUS:
certainly could be,

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that

We would have some very difficult problems

under Footnote 14 o£ the Illinois Brick case, although we would
still argue, the Attorneys General in the states would still
argue that we had a substantive remedy created by the Act.
QUKSTIOrJ:

You, as parens patriae, atate of Minnesota,

could recover for Mrs. Reiter's loss, even though she could not
herself?
MR, tPANNAUS:

We would argue that way, but the

reason ive feel that private actions are important is because,
first of all, the states don't have the resources and the
ability to bring all the possible meritorious actions that may
exist, and,secondly, it could make the whole situation become
very political.

If the Attorney General had to bring every

conceivable action in the stats, he might then be forced to
bring some actions he wouldn't normally bring because he felt

26

they were without merit, and he would bring them merely to make
sure that he wasn't criticized at some future date for not
bringing the action»
And so, the other provision that Congress granted was
the opt-out provision in the bill itself.

Congress said that

individuals who didn't feel they wanted to participate in the
action of the Attorney General and wanted to retain their own
private right to sue, could opt out of any specific action that
their attorney general might bring, and Congress also provided
for an opt-out provision by the entire state.

Upon action of

the legislature, the attorney general can be prohibited from
bringing any action whatsoever,

And you could find a very serious

and difficult position that a consumer in one state would have a
remedy because his legislature did not opt out and a situation
in anotherrita-te where his state did opt out and he would have
no recourse under the federal law.
And so it is clear, I think, in the legislative
history, that Congress did not Intend the attorneys general to
be the exclusive parties in these matters and that private
rights were intended to remain because of the two opt-out
provisions.
And. as I said earlier, the attorneys general don't
have the resources to bring all these potential actions in their
states s
Finally, this Court has expressed concern with the

27

complexity of the treble damage actions and stated recently that
the already protracted treble, damage proceedings should be kept
as simple as possible*,
The states would like to suggest that this would —
affirmance of the Eighth Circuit would merely make a more complex
situation* because an entirely new line of thinking would have
to be devised* a new body of law* to determine whether or not
it was a business or personal purchase* and whether or not the
business purchase was used as intended for a genuinely business
purpose.
So* we would respectfully hope that this Court would
reverse the Eighth Circuit* that affirmance of the Eighth Circuit
would frustrate the underlying principles of the Antitrust Laws
that would permit a price-fixer to keep his illgotfcen gains and
deprive the victim of his most effective remedy and have no
means to be compensated and it would eliminate a major deter­
rent to treble damage actions.

And so xmq would urge this

Court to reverse the Eighth Circuit and reaffirm the existence
of nonbusiness consumer standing.
QUESTION:

Your colleague refers to the Eighth Circuit

opinion as being* basically* a policy decision.

Given the back­

ground in this whole area* is this not something Congress could
correct very* very swiftly if the Eighth Circuit is wrong in its
reading of the statute* or if they thought that the Eighth
Circuit was perhaps correct* but they wanted to enlarge the

28

remed ies ?
MR® SPANNAUS:

I think that it is clear, Mr» Chief

Justice — I think it is clear from the legislative history
■that Congress has always felt that consumers did have the right
to bring these actions®

However, if the fighth Circuit were

affirmed there would be a lot of immediate activity to have this
correctedo

But I feel that that would certainly be unnecessary

end, in all due respect, sometimes very time-consuming because
Congress does not always act as swiftly as one might hold»
QUESTION:

It is often suggested that the Court should

l;ake steps because the legislative process is a bit on the slow
side,,

That's not a reason for a decision, is it?
MR® SPANNAUS:

No, sir, Mr® Chief Justice, ifc is not®

However, I think that Congress has already acted and through the
reading of the language of the legislative history of the Sherman
Act, as we talked about here earlier, and also the discussions
that were — back in '73, E7^ and ”75 when the Antitrust Improve»
menfc Acts were passed -- that Congress had already assumed that
the consumer had this right and, consequently, they felt that
it wasn't necessary to make it any more clear®
I think that the courts, if I may say — that the
eighth Circuit has gone beyond what the Congress intended and
they are the ones who have acted as a policy in a legislative
way, rather than this Court doing the same thing if they reverse
the eighth Circuit,

29

QUESTION:

General Spannaus. your brief is joined by

forty-nine states?
MR. SPANNAUS:
QUJ3TI0N:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Which is the missing one?

MR. SPANNAUS:

Mr. Justice Blackmun# the only state

who is not participating is the State of Georgia.
QUESTION:

i-oes that imply they are on the other side

of the case?
MR. SPANNAUS:

No.

The Attorney General of Georgias

Mr. Arthur Bolton# has not participated in the Antitrust Improve­
ment Act of 1976, in using any of the funds# and so he hasr also
decided not to participate in this amicus brief.
QUiSTIGN:

He is a frequent litigator here.

I wondered.

No implication.
QUESTION:

Of course# Georgia recovered once as a

consumer# didn'it it; in a Georgia case where Georgia was the
plaintiff?

Maybe it doesn't need this statute.
MR. SPANNAUS:

Mr. Justice .Stevens# that's probably

the reason he figures he can do it- on his own.

The other 49

states have it.
Thank you# very much for allowing us to participate.,
MR. CHXmF JUSTICE BURGOR:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIAN R,

-.SQ,*

ON BL-HAIF OF RL3 PONLLNTS
MR, WXEHEIM:

Mr«, Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
My name is Julian R, Wilheim* and X am one of the
attorneys who will argue today for the Respondents* the other
one being Mr. Eliot S, Kaplan,
With the Court's permission. I will try to devote my
time primarily to the background of the legislation involved in
this case and the legislative history that goes to the question
here which is a very narrow one.

Accordingly* I will use fifteen

minutes or less in the process,
I would like, initially* to put into perspective what
X haven't heard yet this morning.
very narrow issue,

This is a case involving a

Xfc purports to be a class action* but as

yet there has been no certification of the class,

£o we are

talking essentially about a Plaintiff named Mrs, Reiter,
The complaint in the case — and the pleadings are in
the Appendix before the Court — speaks on occasion as if there
had been price-fixing by these Respondents* as if there had been
a retail price maintenance program.
While it is true that in a motion to dismiss* which
essentially is what this motion was that raised the standing
issue* the facts that are well pleaded are admitted for the
purpose of the motion.

The motion did not admit either legal

31

conclusion or facts that do not exist.
This is not a price-fixing case.

And the reason I

wish to emphasize that is that in the opposing briefs there is
a concerted effort to pose the case as a price-fixing case, and
therefore to indicate as if the Respondents were doing something
that is per se bad under the Antitrust laws*
We have noted in a footnote in our brief in opposition
that with respect to Beltone Electronics Corporation, which
happens to be my client, we have been in a very long Section 5
PTC case in which the Administrative law Judge has found flatly
that Beltone does not fix prices*
QUESTION:

Mr. Wilhelm, is the thrust of your argument

then that if this were a price-fixing case the Plaintiff would
have standing?
MR. WILHHIM:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Well, then, what's the point of it?

MR. WXLHRIM:

The point is I do not want this Court

to have the psychological view that these are these bad things
called "price-fixes," as distinguished from other violations of
the Antitrust laws which, for example, would come under the
OyIvanla case under the rule of reason.
QUESTION:

But the merits of the case aren't before

us at all hers, are they?
MR. WJ jHL-SM:

No, the merits are not before you, nor

should they be at this moment, but on the other hand candor to

32

Court should require the Petitioners to point out not again and
again and again# as they do in their briefs# that these are
price-f ixers .
QUESTION:

But Mr. Wilhelm# if we should adopt the

rule that you urge us to adopt# it would apply to prlce»fixers.
iot, 1 don't know why that's an unfair argument»

He is saying

we shouldn’t adopt a rule that will give an immunity bath to
price-fixers.
MR, WIuH-CIM:

True# Mr. Justice Stevens# but all I am

saying is that I don't want the Court to get the impression that
they are dealing with these bad fellows called "priee-fixers. ’
QU'i;TION:

Nevertheless# you are the spokesman for

those.1 bad fellows on that issue we have to decide.
MR. WILHhIM:

Jfc is not based on price-fixing.

It is

based on -QUIuTION:

But you are still the spokesman for the

price—fixers because the way we decide the case will depend
will determine how those people can act.
MR. WX.lHhIM:

Inferentially# I presume that if you go

to the wide world that is true.
QUESTION:

Better take the hard facts and meet them

square on.
MR. WILH.IIM:
is new ninety years old.

Now# we are dealing with a statute that
Judge Larsen# in the Reiter decision

at the outset of this case denying the motion to dismiss for

33
tack of standing very aptly pointed out at page 937 of his
opinion that nobody knows what the word "consumers" meant when
the Sherman Act i\rae under consideration.

Nobody knows what

C ongress was thinking about at the time with regard to retail
consumers# except if you read the history you will find that there
was great concern in the Congress that they would be interfering
wifch state's rights and state's jurisdiction if they dealt with

tne kind of retail consumer that we have today in our society.
In the context of the society at the time# we had come
to the end of the first hundred years of the Republic,
been a depression in the '70s,

There had

There had been a depression in

the '80s* and there had come along in our economic society this
then new thing which we called "trusts,"

There were corporations

and corporations were to some degree regulated by the states, but
there were these trusts which were completely unregulated.

And

there was the squabble going on between the Democratic Party and
the Republican Party at the time over protective tariffs, and
peoplw were clamoring for some halter on the trusts, as they
were called at the time.
President Grover Cleveland made a speech to the
Congress in his third message on the hfcate of the Union that
something had to be done about the trusts.

And in 1888, Senator

Sherman» in the Fiftieth Congress, introduced resolutions to the
effect that something had to be done about the trusts.
We finally get to the Fifty-third Congress* where we

34

had his bill# 3enate Bill 1# which was the forerunner of the
Sherman Antitrust Act.

And if you read this legislative history

carefully# the bill was finally sent to the Senate Judiciary
Committee and it came out in a relatively few days with nothing
left except its title S. 1 and Senator Sherman's name»

Absolutely

obliterated everything he had in his bills except his name and
the title.

.
The bill came out of the Senate Judiciary Committee

and for the first time we had this phrase that we are worrying
here with today called "business or property."
mean?

What does it

The various members of the Senate Judiciary Committee

talked about the small businessman# the small mechanic who is
in business.

He talked about small farmers and you can find

In there references to problems such as the one I remember most
specifically.

If a small tobacco farmer had to go to the "trust"

to buy bailing cotton to bail his tobacco and he was overcharged#
this was the kind of commercial enterprise we were talking about.
Nowhere do we find any definition of property such as we try to
find in the dictionary# the Webster's International Unabridged#
Black's Lav; dictionary.

I went back to Bouvier's Law Dictionary

of my law school days of many years ago — Nothing that will give
us a guideline.

All that you can sense out of this total legis-

lative history on the Sherman Act was they were talking about
ousinass or property in the total commercial sense of property
Involved in business

35

1 heard today they didn't talk about a class action.
They did.

There was reference to a class action.

There was

even reference to setting up a dual jurisdiction befcx^een the
federal and the state courts for class action» and then Congress
turned tail and said» "Forget it* because we are worried.

Vie

think our only basis for enacting this kind of antitrust legis­
lation is the Commerce Clause."

Now we hear ninety years later about the consumer.
And I think Mr, Chief Justice is correct.
In this Court.

The answer lies not

It is a different society.

It is a different economic picture.

It is a differant
If the consumer

needs the protection that we are trying to engraft on this
ancient statute» this antiquated statute» in that sense» the
remedy lies in the Congress.
QUESTION:

Of course» the insurance Industry heard

about it fifty-five years later in Southeastern Underwriters.
MR, WXIHiJM:

Yes» they did» Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

But we are talking about a retail consumer for personal use of
articles of wear» if you will» in this case.
QUESTION:

What do you do about all the language in

the cases and debates and all about the purpose to protect
consumers» as the ultimate objective of this legislation?
MR, WILHFIM:

I think in many instances nobody has

found out what we are talking about.

The cases are there»

Mr. Justice btevens. but the word "consumer" as we know it today

36

has never been defined.
In one of the briefs, and I think It is the Government
brief, for example, there is a citation to the text written by
Areecia & Turner,

And I checked it out and I am amazed to find

that in that reference these authors have a heading in black
letters called "Consumers and Noncommercial Plaintiffs."
I really would like to know what he5s talking about,
»

because when you read the next half a dozen pages it's as un­
clear as a mist.
But why did he, this notable text writer, use the
words "consumers and noncommercial plaintiffs"?

He must have

had something in mind,
QUdSTIGM:

Suppose he had Mrs. Reiter in mind.

She

seems to fit that class,
MR, WX.1HJXM:

Consumers and noncommercial plaintiff : „

Are they two different kinds of people?

Or ie it one?

If

consumers"meant in 1890 what I think it meant, from reading the
extensive legislative history, then noncommercial plaintiffs
used today — a Mrs,, Reiter — and while she is a consumer in
our modern society, obviously, she was not that consumer about
which the Congress was talking in 1890*
When we turn to the 1914 Clayton Act legislative
history, there is no help to be found.

They simply reiterated

what was section 7 of the .Sherman Act.
I have heard some talk here today about parens patriae

37
!

and about direct purchases.

This Plaintiff was not based on the

pleadings and could not have been a direct purchaser0
from a retail hearing aid dealer.

She bought

She did not buy from these

manufacturers,
I don't know where Illinois Brick is coming into the
picture* if and when we ever go back to the lower court.
With regard to parens patriae* 1 went through the
legislative history of the 1976 statute very carefully because
in the Government's brief they say it's a procedural device.
They point to Footnote 14 in the Illinois Brick case* in the
state's brief.

We find that the states are saying it created

a new cause of action* a substantive right.

And if* by chance*

you have to interpret the 1976 parens patriae provisions* they
would prefer to have it treated as a substantive provision.
Well, the legislative history of the '76 Act is quite
something to read,

There were three bills in the House.

was one bill in the .Senate,

There

The bills went back and forth.

There came a time when they were worried about losing the bill
because of a filibuster by Senator Allen of Alabama* at the end
of that particular session.

There was never a conference.

There

was a legislative legerdemain such as I have never read in my
lifetime* where a motion was made by Senator Byrd* then the
♦

Majority Whip.

Senator Philip Hart handled it* and the upshot

was two sections* which we are not concerned with here* the
first two sections of that Act* were the House’s version.

The

38

third section, which is parens patriae, was the version of the
> enate.

It was

the Senate's bill.

sponsor of the bill

And If you read what the

said, Senator Hart, and his analysis of the

bill, as they passed it, he says very specifically, "We created
a new cause of action."
In that respect, with due deference to the Court,
Footnote 14, in

the ■Illinois Brick case, which says it's a pro­

cedural device,

and which cites only the House report on the

bill, is just plain incorrect, because •!enator Hart's remarks^
as sponsor of the bill, of the intention, the intention to
create, quote, "a new cause of action," unquote, and the •
Senate report are to the contrary.
And I would say they govern it.

And so you have a

sew:-cause of action and I do not believe that an adverse ruling
such as that of the .eighth Circuit will obviate the parens
patriae provision or take the heart out of it.
I think that is all that needs to be said on the
legislative history, and that I can sit down.
MR. CHI.JF JUSTICE BURGkR:

39
ORAL ARGUMENT OP JLXOT £3. KAPLAN. ELQ. ,

ON BLHALF OF RJ3P01L-NTS
MR. KAPLAN:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Mr» Wilhelm has stated for you in summary form the
.legislative history which inequivocally demonstrates that a
consumer who purchases for noncommercial purposes does not have
standing under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.
I would like to take just a moment to dwell on the
term "consumer."

That term has been used throughout the briefs

and throughout the morning's arguments.
Anyone who makes a purchase, who consumes goods, is
a consumer.,

General Motors is a consumer.

is a consumer.

My client, Textron,

Mrs. Reiter is also a consumer.

The courts and the Congress never talked about con»
surners who purchase for nonbusiness or commercial purposes.
Today, in our present day society, the word "consumer" has taken
cn some new meaning.

When we talk about consumer, we think of

the myriad of people out there, the masses of people.

The Congress

in 1890 and the courts prior to Judge Larsen didn't think of
consumer as that group of people.
QULLTIQN:

Generally, doesn't it mean retail purchases,

in the common parlance of today?
MR. KAPLAN:

That may be, Your Honor.

However, that

is not necessarily the definition of the term "consumer."

40

QUESTION:

What is the definition?

MR» KAP.iAN:

Consumer is anyone who buys and consumes

goods, that’s correct»
QUK-sT ION:

Presumably --

— either for his own use or for use of

the purchased product in the manufacture of other products
whatever»

or

He consumes it»
MR» KAPLAN:
QUbfeTION:

That is corrects, Mr» Justice Stewart»
Whether it is a bar of soap or a thousand

tons of steel»
MR» KAPLAN:

That is right.

However, the Congress and the courts have limited the
term "consumer,"

throughout the debates in the Congress and

through interpretation»
I direct this Court’s attention to its opinion — the
opinion of Mr» Justice Marshall

in the case of Hawaii v»

Standard Oil, a case that has not yet been mentioned this
morning, which we suggest is controlling in this case»

The

Court may recall the issue in Hawaii was whether or not Hawaii
could maintain an action on behalf of its citizens» -- It was
not whether it could maintain an action on behalf of its
citizens, but rather whether the injury was compensible under
Section 4»
The critical question was whether the injury asserted
by Hawaii, in its parens patriae count is an injury to Its
business or property.

That was the critical question this

41

Court addressed in Hawaii v, Standard Oil.
QUiLTXON:

In that case, Hawaii was not suing as a

purchaser, was it?
MR, KAP.7.AN:

It was, but that was not the issue before

she Court.
QUJfcT.lON:

That8s not whafc was dealt with in the

opinion?
MR. KAPLAN:

That’s right.

It was suing its parens

oafcriae capacity for injuries to the general economy of Hawaii*
That was the issue before the Court.

And this Court, as a thresh­

old question, had to determine what is business or property?
Is an injury to the general economy of the State of Hawaii ar«
injury to business or property?
This Court, through Mr* Justice Marshall, said like
the lower courts, that it considered the meaning of the words
‘'business or property,"

"We conclude that they refer to com­

mercial interests or enterprises,

states can only sue when they

seek damages for injuries to their commercial interests."
It couldn't be more clear than as articulated by
Mr. Justice Marshall in Hawaii v. Standard uil*
There are many other lower courts8 decisions that have
also followed the same language.

The Ninth Circuit’s decision

in the Air Pollution case is in accord with the decision in
Hawa :L i v. S ta nda rd Oi 1.

QUESTION:

But that was a state, and almbst by

42

definition a state — A state, for example, doesn't boy a pair
of shoes to wear*

If it buys shoes, it buys them in its com»

mere la 1 capacity for people in its prisons, or whatever*
MR. KAPLAN:

The states are always buying in a business

or commercial sense, when they buy in their proprietary capacity.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. KAPLAN:

They will never buy a dress to wear.

They may buy a dress for nurses who work

for a state hospital.
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

Yes.
Mow, Mr. Thomas pointed out that Judge

Williams in the famous California trilogy of cases was concerned
about this, the dress that's worn by a nurse and the one that
she wears to a party In the evening.
That may be a problem, but that can be handled very
easily.

All that need be done is when a plaintiff brings on an

action it believes that the purpose was for a business or com»
mere la 1 use.
If the Congress believes that that is the wrong result,
the Congress can change that.

That is a problem of Congress*

making, not of our making.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kaplan, what if Mrs. Reiter here had

alleged she needed a hearing aid to adequately perform as a
lawyer, she was in the business of a lawyer, being a lawyer?
MR. KAPLAN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc, if Mrs. Reiter

had alleged she purchased the. hearing aid in order to carry out

43

aer profession or her chosen occupation* she would be buying it
as a tool for her business or profession, which would then be
protected' under Section 4 of the Clayton Act,

She would then

nave a cuase of action for damages, under Section 4.

If she

aid not make that allegation, she would not have standing under
Section 4.
QUESTION:
MR» KAPLAN:

So. it is really just unemployed consumers?
That is not -- It is a person who is

purchasing for strictly personal use.

If Mrs. Reiter has just

decided that she is going to wear a hearing aid, just because
she wants to hear the television a bit better* and she may have
been overcharged, she doesn't have standing.

That was not the

intent of Section 4„
There has been discussion by our worthy opposition
this morning that how can we allow a foreign government to sue
but yet we can't allow consumers of this country.

That is a very

interesting question, and obviously this Court was not unanimous
in deciding that a foreign government had standing.

However,

Mr. Justice Stewart in writing the majority opinion in the Pfizer
t

case, said expressly that there was no legislative history that
he could find, and therefore he looked to other areas of law and
found that foreign governments have traditionally been held to
be persons who could sue in the courts in the United States.
In the instant case, we have a clear mandate from the
Congress,and that mandate has been revealed here this morning by

44

Mr» Wilhelmo
The Court in Illinois Brick recognized that not every
person injured by the Antitrust Laws is going to have a remedy.
The Court said in the Illinois Brick decision* "Not every injury
traceable to an antitrust violation is cognizable under Section
4 of the Clayton Act."
This Court further limited the right to bring treble
damage actions to those persons who purchase directly from alleged violators and refuse to permit indirect purchasers to dem»
onstrate a pass-on of alleged price overcharges.
This Court, therefore, expressly acknowledged that
the decision would deny recovery to some who may have been
injured by antitrust violations, but recognized the practical
limits upon the sanction on a private right of action.
The Court was mindful that there are people who will
be injured, just as we suggest Mrs. Reiter might be injured,, by
an alleged overcharge that came about because of an antitrust
violation.

But there are many others who i^ill have standing

to bring the action that will serve as the deterrent to antitrust violators.
I might point out -QUISTION:

It worries me.

I thought all antitrust

was to protect the consumer.
MR. KAPLAN:

Mr. Justice Marshall, there is no questior

but that antitrust laws —

45

QUESTION:

I have yet to find anybody who sells me

anything protecting me.

He protects himself» but he doesn't

protect me.
MR. KAPLAN:

Mr* Justice Marshall, the concern of the

antitrust laws is to protect the consumer welfare.
term that is used throughout the briefs.

That is a

Professor Bork has been

cited on many occasions.
Let me explain that term.. When we are talking about
consumer welfare, the Congress and the courts have not been
talking about compensating a consumer.

We are talking ab:ut

permitting the consumer to purchase goods in a free and open
competitive society.

That is the ultimate test that every court

must apply in determining whether or not there has been a sub­
stantive violation of the antitrust laws, whether or not the
action will permit the consumer to buy in that open competitive
society.

The issue is not whether the consumer can be compen­

sated .
And that is an important distinction that we have
today.

The distinction —

MR. KAPLAN;
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN;

How am I protected if 1 am overcharged.'
You are protected, Mr. Justice Marshall -»
I just don't know how well off 1 am.
Let me tell you how well off you are.
I'd be interested in that.
There are several ways that you are going

46

to be protected,

Number one* in 1976* the Congress permitted

vour attorney to collect attorney's fees if he brings an action
for injunction,,
QUESTION:

Who pays the attorney?

Don't 1 have to go

get the attorney?
MR* KAPLAN:

You have to go to an attorney* sir* and

entitled to

QULcTION:

What kind of an injunction is Mrs» Reiter

going to get?
MRo KAPLAN:

She will get an injunction stopping these

practices.
QUESTION:

She's already got the hearing aid.

MR, KAPLAN:

The other remedies. Mr, Justice Stevens

are that the parens patriae action is available to her,
QU.-BTIQM;

So she's got to go to the Attorney General

and convince him to bring a parens patriae.

She would rather

go to the lawyer on the corner and say,, "All I want is about
$9 on this thing.

They overcharged me."

Does she have to go through all this to get her $9?
MRc KAPLAN:

Let me just address that question* if I

may* Mr, Justice Stevens,
Let's talk to Mrs, Reiter and going to that corner

There is no question about that, Mr. Justice

Marshall, but it is a miniscule claim in terms of the size of
claims that the federal courts have traditionally heard.

terms of the size of most of the claims that are filed.

I respectfully
It is not the

It is, rather, the

Plaintiff's bar that has the real and direct interest in this
litigation.

It is they who are concerned about what's going to

They are not concerned with the burden

that's going to be placed upon the administration of justice and
upon the courts of this country by having miniscule claims of
consumers imposed upon it *
But for Rule 23* Mrs, Reiter wouldn't be here.

She

It is interesting that Judge Larson

said —
QUIiTION:

Yes* but suppose she bought an Oriental

rug or* perhaps* she bought a house and didn't like the commis­
sion she was charged and wanted to complain about the fixing of
brokers’ commissions or didn’t like the fee that her lawyer was
charging* because there are minimum fee schedules*

There are

a lot of individual consumer claims that might amount to enough
money to precipitate litigation*

And you would rule all thouse

out* too*
MR, KAPLAN:

That is correct* Mr* Justice otevens,

And I believe that we have to look at what is the intent and
the object of the Antitrust Laws?

Is it just to compensate

people* or is it to deter antitrust violations?
QUESTION:

Well. what kind of deterrent would remain

for a conspiracy among retail Oriental rug dealers* if your
view prevails?

What would be the deterrent?

MR, KAPLAN:

The parens patriae action*

The threat of

Government action* both in the United States and elsewhere*
QUESTION:

How many of those have succeeded?

parens patriae actions were there in the last 80 years?

How many

49

MR» KAPLAN:

i ara sorry, Mr* Justice Stevens, I don't

have the number.
QUESTION:

There haven't been any, have there?

MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

I don*t know.
Is there a difference, Mr. Kaplan, between

merchandise which is fungible and merchandise which is not?

I

suppose hearing aids, like automobiles, fall into certain cate­
gories, but Oriental rugs — one Oriental rug is unlike any other
Oriental rug in the world.
MR. KAPLAN:

Is that not so?

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, it certainly is

a one-of-a-kind item.

I am not sure that is a valid distinction,

that one should be recoverable and another not.
I think it is important to understand that the
Respondents are not arguing before a congressional body today.
We are not saying who should or who should not recover.

If it is an unpopular result, that

That is for Congress to correct,

not for the Court to say it is what the law intended in 1890.
QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Kaplan, if you have been reading

the papers for .the last three or four weeks, you realize this
Court doesn't hesitate to reach unpopular results.
What about the Chattanooga language of Justice Holmes?
MR. KAPLAN:

The opposition, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

50

has certainly relied upon Chattanooga as the controlling case,
Chattanooga was a case that involved the statute of limitations8
That was the issue in Chattanooga«

It involved the City of

Atlanta purchasing pipe for its city sewer and water operations„
It bought in a proprietary capacity-

The issue of a noncommer­

cial or a nonbusiness consumer was not before the Court when
Mr, Justice Holmes wrote that opinion *

The issue is not there»

That case is a very narrow case and that speaks only to the
question of the statute of limitations, and there happens to be
some discussion about the fact that the City of Atlanta was in­
jured in its business or property because it overpaid and the
worth of the property was overpriced because of an alleged price-

QUESTION:

We would at least have to disavow what you

consider to be dicta in that case, would we not?
MR» KAPLAN:

No, because in that case you did not have

bhe noncomsumer purchaser»

You had a state acting in a business

or proprietary capacity, which is exactly what we say .the re­
sults should be in that case»

And that is what the courts have

followed consistently since Chattanooga»
The issue of a nonconsumer — excuse me, a nonbusiness
consumer — was mb foefer© the Court in Chattanooga»
QUESTION:

So, you read as a gLoss on the language

"{any injury to business or property"that it must be suffered by
a business consumer?

51

MR, KAPLAN;

No,

It must be an injury to your business

or to your property.
And the Court might ask me, why use both words, if we
are talking about a business,

And I think that is a very valid

question.
If .the Court will- -Look at the Waldron decision; cited

It covered his

It was not his business.

So» ,

if the Congress had simply said "injury in„,ypu.r business»"
Mr, Waldron would not have had standing to recover damages
under section 4«
QUESTION:

Well» it was his business.

It wasn't his

principal business» maybe,
MR, KAPLAN;

It was striely an investment» just as»

Mr, Justice Stewart» if you or I bought a stock.

It would not

be our business» or even an ancillary business» of buying stocks.
It’s an investment» strictly something that we do,

And it is

a commercial property right that we would have,
QUESTION:

I wonder if you have really fully dealt

with the Chattanooga case» because» as I recall the case»
Mr, Justice Holmes first indicated he did not have to rely on
the fact that the city was in the business of supplying water»

52

and therefore put the business aspect to one side» and* there­
fore* relied exclusively on the fact that there was an over­
charge for property®

Which seems to me to take the commercial

aspect out of the analysis*
MR* KAPLAN:

Well* I don't think that you can divorce

che property aspect* Mr* Justice Stevens* from the decision*
v

->-•

:

You must look at the entire decision of the Court®
QUYwTIQN:

But he specifically did* ae X remember it*

l may have remembered incorrectly.
MR® KAPLAN:

I don't believe, Mr* Justice Stevens* that

he defined the term "property" in that decision®

And the only

property involved in that case* if we are talking about the
property* was a commercial property.

That was the property in

that case.
If all you had to do was to pay more money than some­
thing was worth* because of a price-fixing conspiracy* the
Congress could have eliminated the words "business or property*"
Why are they there?

They are there for a specific reason* be-

cause if the Congress wasn't concerned about commercial inter­
ests they could have done with Section 4 exactly what it did
with Section 16®
The Congress knew how to do it when they wanted to
provide a remedy to everyone* and they did it in Section 16*
In conclusion* I'd like to point out that the fact
that current thinking today* in the minds of the American public*

53
might dictate a congressional result different from that which
the Congress reached in 1890 and again in 1914, does not provide
a justification for this Court to legislate»

If a new remedy

;.s needed., then the Congress should provide for it.
Again, this was the approach taken by this Court just
a year ago in the famous Illinois Brick decision.

This Court

-recognized that indirect purchasers may be injured as much or
«ore than direct purchasers, but nevertheless the mass of liti­
gation and administrative burden on the courts caused this Court
to conclude that treble damage actions should be limited to
direct purchasers.
QUESTION:

Well, there were other considerations

besides that, were there not, in Illinois Brick?
MR. KAPLAN:
Justice.

Yes, there certainly were, Mr. Chief

However, the Court recognized that not everybody is

going to have a remedy for compensation.
distinction*
effect.

That is an important

The right to compensation versus the deterrent

The deterrent effect will be there because in almost

every consumer case — here I am using the word quite loosely =>in every case brought by a nonbusiness consumer, I think the
Court would find that there has been a companion case brought by
a business consumer.
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

Are you talking about the Butone case?
Beltone?
Belt one, yes

54

MR„ KAPLAN:

That is correct,,

In the hearing aid case that we have right here*, there
were also dealer actions brought»
QUESTION:

Before or after this one?

MR, KAPLAN:

Prior to»

Perhaps a year or two before

this case was brought»
QUESTION:

Lon't assume that I agree with you that it

is important»
MR» KAPLAN:

No»

However, I point out that, in terms of the deterrent
effect, if the Court will examine almost every action that has
been brought by a nonbusiness consumer, it will find that in
almost every situation there lias also been a companion- case
brought by a business consumer»

Therefore, the deterrent effect

is not lost by the fact that the nonbusiness consumer cannot bring
the action*
If there are no further questions -«
QUI5TION:

Could you explain for me again why you

Congress used both words»
MR, KAPLAN:

In order to demonstrate that there must

be a commercial or business interest involved»

If it had just

said "business" without property, for example, it would have
excluded the kind of injury that Mr» Waldron had who was em­
ployed in one business but was injured in an investment, a
contract.

He was buying and selling contracts in oil importation»

That's an injury to business.

QU.CLTI0N:

So, you think Congress intended then to

cover something besides business?
MR. KAPLAN;

They intended to cover property interests

something that was commercial*
QUESTION:

So the answer is yes?

MRo KAPLAN:
and business.

No,. The answer Is commercial property

And there is a distinction between the two.

QUESTION:
MR, KAPLAN:

So, it does cover something besides business?
It covers commercial property interests,

yes.
QU.JSTION:
business, as I say?

So, it does cover something besides
Yes, It does.

MR, KAPLAN:
QUESTION:
ME, KAPLAN:

Yes, it does,
So, the answer is not "no,"
The answer is not no.

It covers business

and commercial property.
Are there any other questions from the Court?
QUESTION:

I wasn't quite sure — You started to

answer why the Pfizer case wasn't important, or didn't control,
I never quite understood the end of your answer.

You started to

discuss it,
MR, KAPLAN:

In the Pfizer decision, Mr, Justice

Stewart looked to legislative history and didn't find any help
in the legislative history.

He then went to other areas of the

law beyondj the antitrust area, beyond Section 4 of the Clayton
Act, which uses the term "p^rstah,-" and found that foreign govern»
ments have traditionally had standing to sue in our courts.

He,

therefore, found that a foreign government must, therefore, have
standing to sue under Section 4,
In our case, we have called this Court's attention to

57

a clear legislative history that indicates that a person who
buys for nonbusiness use or noncommercial use does not have
standing®
QUESTION;

ho you think your argument applies to

foreign governments who buy drugs for noncommercial use?
MR® KAPLAN:

Mr» Justice Stevens, I can’t conceive of

a situation where any government would buy in a nonbusiness or
nonproprietary capacity*

MR, THOMAS:

Mr, Chief Justice* and the other Members

of this Court* I have nothing to say in rebuttal,
MR, CHIDF JUSTICE BURG HR:
Mr, Thomas

I have a question for you*

59

On your theory of the case, suppose an action were
brought by a housewife., saying that there were nine people in
her household and they consumed three loaves of bread every day
— I don't know what bread is now,

Around 50 cents» I guess*

maybe more —» and that's twenty-one loaves of bread a week and
she is being overcharged 15 cents per loaf and that she is acting
:>n behalf of all the people who buy loaves of bread in St. Paul
and Minneapolis.

Covered by the theory of your case here?

MR, THOMAS:

If it is price-fix?

Yes* Your Honor *

and the beauty of it is that there are certain courts in this
country that are managing those cases.

The other side of it,

and the beauty of it is. from the judicial aspect», that the
judges are free to say* "I cannot manage this case."
There is a milk case out in Arizona where they
actually sent out the class notices» under the court direction,»

Thank you* gentlemen.
