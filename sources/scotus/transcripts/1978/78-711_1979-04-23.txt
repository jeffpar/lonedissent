PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 78-711, Southeastern Community
College v. Davis.
Mr. Gressman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE GRESSMAN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRESSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice., and may it

please the Court:
This is a case of first impression as far as
this Court is concerned.

It is a case involving the inter­

pretation and application of section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 which establishes a broad duty on recipients
of federal aid and assistance not to discriminate against
handicapped persons, against qualified handicapped persons
solely because of their handicap.
I think it essential at the outset to ncte that
this is not a ease of discrimination against a handicapped
person.

This is a case, rather, of a handicapped person

who has been found not qualified to participate ir the
program or activity to which she sought admission.
The uncontested facts as found by the District
Court after an evidentiary hearing, facts and findings
which have not been challenged in the lower courts or

4
essentially before this Court, establish that the respon­
dent, Prances Davis, by concession had a severe hearing
handicap which made it impossible for her to communicate
with other people other than with the use of a hearing
aid and the ability and necessity to read the lips of the
person to whom she is talking, and she must apparently be
face-to-face with the talker.
QUESTION:

Are you telling us that the hearing

aid did not compensate fully or substantially for the
handicap?
MR. GRESSMAN:

That is essentially the finding

implicit in the District Court’s opinion, yes.

It was a

combination though of the hearing aid plus the necessity
to read lips, and even then that was found to be E.n inade­
quate compensation for the severity of the hearing: handicap.
Now —
QUESTION:

Mr. Gi’essman, she was a licensed

practical nurse, was she not, for some years?
MR. GRESSMAN:

That is true, apparently about

ten years previously.
QUESTION:

And is there anything in the record

which indicates that she was unable to perform these
duties or that she did so with hazard to the patients?
MR. GRESSMAN:

There is nothing in the record

one way or the other on that.

We do not know, for example.

5
even whether her hearing handicap was that severe at the
time she wanted the LPN license.
QUESTION:
tion.

Well, that leads me to my next ques­

Is there anything in the record that protects the

public when a licensed registered nurse becomes handicapped
as this respondent was after her licensure had been obtained?
MR. 6RESSMAN:

Yes.

Under the North Carolina

statutes, the state licensing bureau is authorised to revoke
any license it has previously granted because of incompetent
or inadequate nursing practice under any license, whether
it be an LPN license or an RN license.

That is very clearly

set forth in the statutes and I would assume that is a
fairly universal provision with respect to any licensing
activity,
QUESTION:

Are they fulfilled In actual practice?

Does the record show that?
MR. GRESSMAN:

Do you mean if they have lifted

licenses?
QUESTION:

That licenses have been terminated or

revoked.
MR. GRESSMAN:
no.

There is nothing in this record,

This is solely, you might say, an ad hoe factual de­

velopment solely related to this particular individual.
have no evidence as to the general practices of the
licensing authorities.

We

6
Now, the court made the critical determinations
in terms of this respondent's lack of qualifications either
to participate in the training program or in her ultimate
profession as a registered nurse.

The court specifically

found that her hearing handicap actually prevents her from
safely performing in both her training program and her
proposed registered nurse profession. # And the court found
and concluded that there are numerous situations where her
hearing disability would render her unable to function
properly in a clinical situation, in a nurse-patient rela­
tionship.

And finally the court emphasized that what was

a particular concern to this court was the potential danger
to the patients in the hospitals who would be unable to
in many situations communicate effectively with this par­
ticular nurse trainee or ultimately the professional nurse.
Many patients obviously are incapable of addressing the
nurse face-to-face so that her lips could be read, cr
there might be situations where various crises develop that
could not be heard by the nurse who had her back turned
in a particular situation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Qressman, you spoke of the nurse’s

activities in terms of a hospital.

There are some nurses

who function in private homes taking care of patie.its, too,
are there not?
MR. GRESSMAN:
*

That is true, but in the nurses

7
braining program they only have this clinical prop-ram in
the hospital.
QUESTION:

Is there any statute giving a cause of

action against an Individual who would refuse to employ a
nurse, a registered nurse on the grounds that the registered
nurse had a handicap of this kind?
MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

Well —

Would that be discriminatory under any

federal statute?
MR. GRESSMAN:

It could be discriminatory under

504 even in that employment relationship*

if you decline

to employ a qualified handicapped person solely because of
his handicap.
QUESTION:

If you are receiving federal financial

aid.
MR. GRESSMAN:
right.

Federal financial aid, that is

Now, there are other
QUESTION:

I am talking about an Individual.

I

was addressing my question to an individual in the private
home.
MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

Do you mean the individual —

Is it a restriction or does it violate

any statute, civil rights or otherwise, for a person who
Is ill, for the family of that person to refuse to hire a
registered nurse on the ground that she is hard of hearing?

8
9

MR. GRESSMAN:

I would assume not, that is no

form of state action which any kind of a statute could reach
as essential basis for imposing any kind of an anti­
discrimination policy.
QUESTION:

But there are statutes about employment

which do not involve state action, are there not?
MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, there are in employment situ­

ations where the employer has a contractual relationship
with the federal government or with the state, and as a con­
dition to the maintenance of that contractual relationship
they may be prohibited from refusing to employ a handicapped
person who is qualified solely because of his handicap.

But

you would have to have some relationship with a government
agency or program, either through contract or through express
coverage.

But as far as a purely private individual who is

ill at home, I would assume that there is nothing to pro­
hibit that person from discriminating as to whom he wants
to employ as a nurse.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gressman, does section 504 apply
s

to hospitals as well as schools if they receive federal -MR. GRESSMAN:
of some sort, yes.
QUESTION:

If it is a federally funded program

Now --Do you think the result of 504 and the

valid regulations promulgated pursuant to it would be to
prevent a hospital from saying we will hire only registered

9
nurses who have become registered under the North Carolina
laws?
MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, you have something of that

problem, I understand, in the pending petition for certiorari
in the Traveser case where a private hospital allegedly
discriminated and refused to hire a handicapped nurse.
There are cases of that nature where if the hospital is in
some way related to a fede:<*ally funded program for employ­
ment purposes, that that hospital would be subject to 504.
QUESTION:

But there is nothing in 50*4 that would

in a.ny way require North Carolina to alter its standards
for licensing registered or licensing nurses?
MR. GRESSMAN:
Honor.

Not a bit, not in any way, Your

I think that 504 is

very broad in scope and it

makes no pretense at revising or altering or conditioning
state licensing laws that may be appropriate for certain

i
professions that happen to involve handicapped persons.
There is not a word on the face of this statute or in its
intent or purpose that would indicate that Congress meant
to revise or alter the reasonable and necessary state
licensing laws with respect to the practice of nursing
by registered nurses who are qualified and capable of
fully performing safe nursing practices.
QUESTION:
question.

Mr. Gressman, could I ask you a

There are two separate things that she might

10
not be qualified to do.

One is to be a registered nurse

because it might be dangerous for her if she couldn't hear
properly; and, secondly, she might 2iot be able to do the
study program adequately.

Now, I understood you to say

that the District Court found that she could not do either.
MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

And some of the findings are ambiguous,

but my interpretation of if was that the District Court
found that she could not progress satisfactorily with the
training because upon completion of the program she could
not safely perform her duties as a nurse.

Do you also read

the finding as saying that if you put to one side how she
performed as a nurse, she still wouldn’t be able to
complete the program because she was unable to hear?
MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

To complete the training program?

Yes.

MR. GRESSMAN:

Yes, she could not effectively

complete the training program because of her handicap

The

state licensing bureau head who wrote a letter — it is in
the record —- said that she could not exactly predict what
would be the situation two or three years hence when this
person, if she got through the training program, would
then be eligible to take a licensing examination.

But she

said that on the basis of her present knowledge, she assumed
that it would be improper and perhaps run undue risk to

11
permit her to participate in the training program, and the
likelihood was that if this condition remained the same
after she were to have completed her training program,
there would be a serious question of whether they would
let her take the licensing examination.
You see, the licensing authorities do not have
any independent sifting out process.

They simply take the

graduates of the nursing schools that have been certified
to them as fully competent, fully qualified nurses, nurse
candidates who are completely able to fulfill all of the
requirements that a registered nurse must have, and they
simply take that and allow them on the basis of that cer­
tification from an accredited nursing program to take the
licensing exam, which is simply a written examination,
there is no physical test made by the licensing authorities,
then that person if she passes the written examination is
given en RN license.
Now, I think it is essential to see how the
structure of section 504 comes into play at this point.
It is a very simple proposition.

The opening words of 504

say that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual
shall solely by reason of his handicap be excluded from
participation or otherwise discriminated against in any
federally funded program or activity.
Now, the essential predicate, in other1 words, for

12

504 coming into operation at all is that the person be
otherwise qualified»

Those are the predicate words that

bring 504 into operation.

Unless you have a qualified

handicapped person, you can never have the kind of dis­
crimination against that person that 504 is talking about.
QUESTION:

Well, except that 504 is talking

about not a qualified but an otherwise qualified nerson.
MR. GRESSMAN:

That is true, Your Honor, and

that is really the problem in this case.

But I think how­

ever you view the words "otherwise qualified," it is
essential to understand that 504 is not talking about the
unqualified handicapped person, otherwise or not.

The

qualification —
QUESTION:

Well, one could read it as saying the

person — and indeed it is the natural reading — that a
person who is qualified except for his handicap shall not
!

be excluded because of his handicap, and I gather none of
the parties here are suggesting it should be read that way.
MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

Nobody —

The blind bus driver and the moronic

graduate student and so on.
MR. GRESSMAN:

That’s right, that is what we

ca.ll the absurd reading —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. GRESSMAN:

-- the literal reading of that

13
language produces the Impossible situation, and that is
that you have to disregard all kinds of handicaped in terms
of —
QUESTION:

Right,

MR. GRESSMAN:

-- and admit them to perform the

most physically demanding Jobs or activities known to man.
Now, this cannot be.
QUESTION:

Well, to disqualify a person, it must

be a job-related handicap, must it not?
MR. GRESSMAN:

Of course, Your Honor,

Now, I

think this brings —
QUESTION:

A blind person would be obviously

disqualified from being a bus driver or a taxi driver but
not necessarily from being an elevator operator nerhans.
MR. GRESSMAN:
think of the example of a

That’s true.

I always like to

aw school who freely admits

blind people, deaf people, paraplegics primarily because
there is no physical qualification for entering into an
academic-type program of that nature.

Therefore, you have

to approach this whole problem on an ad hoe basis.

You

have to look at the qualifications for a particular
activity, you have to look at the particular nature of the
handicap and see whether that is relevant to the qualifica­
tions, and you have to look at and determine xtfhether
ultimately there has been discrimination against the person

once he has been determined he is qualified.

We never get

to that point in this case because we never got above or
beyond the predicate requirement that the person be other­
wise qualified.
Now, the whole problem in this case is one of
confusion and I think, as Mr. Justice Stewart said, these
words "otherwise qualified" have a rather ambiguous note
to them.

But I think the whole thing becomes crystal-

clear if you understand that there are two basic kinds of
programs or activities that may be funded by the federal
government.

The broad type of programs that are covered

are in the academic type programs running from pre-school
education to primary schools, secondary schools and post­
graduate and post-secondary schools, the great mass of the
undergraduate collegiate programs, 95 percent of which, I
assume, would be largely academic in nature.
In those types of programs which are the' great
mass that are covered by 50^, there ordinarily are not any
physical qualifications.
QUESTION:

But surely a person who is blind in

a program that required a substantial amount of reading,
which I assume most academic programs do, or writinp; or
listening, a person who was deaf would hardly be qualified
in the absence of affirmative special assistance to that
person, isn’t that correct?

15
MR. GRESSMAN:

That is exactly true, and 504

regulations issued by HEW to require that certain kinds of
auxilliary aids and assistance be given —
QUESTION:

Under that statute as so worded —

MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

The regulations under this statute.

Under the simple language of this

statute —
MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

That's right.

-- there has been found a requirement

for expenditure of funds for special —
MR. GRESSMAN:

well, it is referred to in the

opinion of the Fourth Circuit below here that on remand of
this ease the court should give consideration to certain
HEW regulations which require, one, auxilliary aids to be
provided to the handicapped person, or, two, to make
modifications in the academic programs.
QUESTION:

And those regulations have been

promulgated under the authority of this statute, the words
of which —
MR. GRESSMAN:

That’s right, Your Honor, they

wore promulgated in 1577.
QUESTION:

Certainly the statute itself gives no

indication of a duty to undertake affirmative action.
MR. GRESSMAN:

No, it does not, Your Honor, and

this is in direct contrast with the preceding two sections,

16
501 and 503.

501 relates to federal employees; 503 re­

lates to government contractors who employ individuals that
may be handicapped, and both of those cases Congress
specifically says that affirmative action and accommoda­
tion shall be made in the iourse of enforcing that non­
discrimination policy.

But Your Honor is exactly right,

there is not one word on the face of 50h that establishes
any duty to make affirmative accommodation.
QUESTION:

Do you challenge the validity of the

regulations Insofar as they are promulgated oursuant to
section 504?
MR. GRESSMAN:

Not at this point. Your Honor.

I think we don’t arrive at that point yet in this case.
You would make affirmative accommodation, if at all, only
if you have an otherwise qualified Individual in a program
or activity where no physical qualifications are at issue
and where the handicap does not affect his qualification.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gressman, was election 50h pleaded?

MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

In the District Court?

Yes.

MR. GRESSMAN:

Yes, it was.

There was an alter­

native claim under 1983 which was a constitutional claim,
but then there was the statutory claim which requested
that she be admitted to the —
QUESTION:

Was there actual reference to 50^?

17
MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, there Is a — It came in

rather obliquely, I believe, in the —
QUESTION:

I should ask your opposition this, of

course, but I take it you are not making any point and you
accept the presence of the 504 issue here?
MR. GRESSMAN:

That’s right, Your Honor.

I think

particularly in the — there are several references to it
in some of the nreliminary pleadings in this case, but —
QUESTION:

What is the effect of the reference

at 15a in the pretrial order?
MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, 1 think that was an elabora­

tion, clarification of her — I don’t think the complaint
was all that clearly drawn

frankly, and I think it became

clarified in the pretrial proceedings and the order.
QUESTION:

You are quite right, if it came in at

all, it came in rather indirectly.
MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Mr. Gressman, are you going to

address the implied cause of action point?
MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, I will, Your Honor.

Your time is getting a bit short.

MR, GRESSMAN:

I would say one final word as to

the interpretation of 504.

It simply does not apply, in

my judgment, to a cause of action which involves a person
who is found to be not qualified, and I think the oerson

18
who is not qualified in his work for participation in a
clinical program raises a most serious policy consider­
ation, because once you leave the academic area where
physical qualifications are no longer an issue and go into
the clinical areas where physical qualifications may be
important to the public safety, health and welfare, then
it seems to me you are outside the intended scope of the
language and the purpose of 504.
Now, we have in this situation a reflection of
this concern by the District Court for the safety of the
patients, and I think that a person who is unqualified to
provide safe nursing care for the great mass of individuals
who are ill and sick raises a serious question as to
whether this 504 duty should be imposed indiscriminately
upon that kind of properam or activity.
Congress has from the very beginning established
a policy that is very much in point here, and I refer to
the statutes in my reply brief.

Under the Nurse Training

Act of 1964, which provides for

financial assistance to

nursing schools and which is the very assistance that was
given to Southeastern Community College in this case, that
is why it is federally funded.

It was federally funded to

provide safe nursing practice and training.
But Congress in that Act said that in no event
shall there be any condition or imposition by the federal

19
authorities of any changes in the curricular, in other
words any kind of affirmative accommodation that Your
Honor spoke of a few minutes ago.

They were concerned that

you maintain the quality and the safety of nurse training
programs, and there was to be no interference with chang­
ing the curriular or the administration of these highly
important and high risk type of clinical traininp; programs
in the nursing school.
And Congress has also told us in another statute,
in the Education Amendments of 197^1, that if the handicapped
people want to participate in these kinds of clinical pro­
grams, Congress authorizes grants and expenditures to com­
munity colleges and other institutions to establish
specially designed programs for the seriously handicapped
who cannot be qualified in terms of the ordinary program.
QUESTION:

You are not leaving yourself much
\
time for the implied cause of action.
MR. GRESSMAN:

I would say as to the implied

cause of action, Your Honor, that not only has it been
fully briefed, but 1 would emphasize what I think is the
conclusive factor in that respect.

In 1973, the Rehabili­

tation Act was amended to provide for two specific kinds
of private causes of action with respect, to wit, the
federal employees and those; who are employed by a recipient
of federal funds in the narrow employment context, where

20
the primary purpose of the grant is to foster and provide
for creating employment relationships.
Now, it seems to me that the very specificity
with which it authorized private causes of action in those
two instances by necessary implication leaves out any kind
of private cause of action for other situations such as we
have here.

Since we do not have a federal employee or do

we have an employment-type situation, Congress has said as
clearly as it can, I assume, that there are to be no other
types of private causes of action.

Otherwise there is

absolutely nothing in the language, in the history of 504
that permits the standards — that permits an implication
of a private cause of action.
There are a few isolated statements by Senators
and perhaps by a committee or two unrelated in time to the
original enactment of this statute —
QUESTION:

Mr. Gressman, your case on that isn't

any stronger than it would be under title VI, is 1t

except

for the '78 amendments?
MR. GRESSMAN:

I think the '78 amendments do make

a vital distinction.
QUESTION:

But absent those, your case is no

stronger than it would be under title VI or IX, would it?
MR. GRESSMAN:

No, except that I think there may

be some differences perhaps with respect to a soendinp;

21

program and with respect to the fact that you are dealing
with an enormous regulatory system that has been developed
In the HEW.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you this.

’78 amendments for the moment.

Put aside the

This is a state agency, we

have the state Involved here.
MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

That's right.

I sunoose that even if there were not

a private cause of action that would have arose directly
under title V, that you might be able to state a cause of
action under 1983, relying on title V.
MR. GRESSMAN:
QUESTION:

You mean on 504?

Yes, on 504, under the provision of —

MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, I am not aware, Your Honor,

that this Court or any court has ever addressed this problem
which I assume has been raised In the Solicitor General's
brief here as to whether you can have a cause of action
under 1983 premised upon a violation of another statute
which gives no cause of action in and of itself.

Now, I

think this Is a highly dangerous or questionable doctrine
because that would mean that you could under 1983, assuming
some kind of state action, you could create causes of
action under all of the provisions of the United States
Code, regardless of whether courts had held that there is
no right of action under a specific —

22
QUESTION:

On the other hand, if the other statute

does give a cause of action, you don't need 1983, do you?
MR. GRESSMAN:
right.

You’re exactly right.

Exactly

So I think it is somewhat a circular and self-

defeating proposition in the end.

All I can say is that

there is absolutely no authority at least in this Court for
permitting, to raise yourself up by your bootstraps, by
using a 1983 cause of action to create a cause of action
that doesn't otherwise exist.
MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time is expired,

Mr. Gressman.
MR. GRESSMAN:

All right.

Your Honor, would it

be possible for me to have leave to supply a reply to the
Solicitor General’s brief?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Yes.

That was a late

filing.
MR. GRESSMAN:

That was, yes,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. GRESSMAN:

Yes, you may.

Yes, I would like to file a very

brief reply to that.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

And as promptly as

possible.
MR. GRESSMAN:

Yes, indeed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OP MARC P. CHARMATZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CHARMATZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Frances Davis is a licensed practical nurse.

She

seeks to enroll in the Southeastern Community College
nursing program and to advance in her education and to reach
her full potential.

She is a hearing impaired woman.

But

the college has refused her that opportunity solely on the
basis of her hearing impairment and without any considera­
tion of possible program modifications to be made in this
case.
The college position as stated in its reply brief

pool of those who are able-bodied in the fullest physical
sense.

Applying this criteria to Mrs. Davis, we have the .

situation as indicated in the reply brief that the college
has applied the rule saying that Mrs. Davis must possess
hearing to the fullest degree without substantial impairment
in order to qualify.
Quite frankly, Your Honors, this would apply to
Mrs. Davis as an LPN, and under this status, under this way
of looking at it, Mrs. Davis would not have the opportunity
to be an LPN where she has safely and efficiently functioned
now for twelve years.

24
It has been assumed by the college —
QUESTION:

Do we know what her physical condition

was when she originally acquired her license as an LPN?
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think we do, Mr. Justice.

The

audiologist's report indicates that Ms. Davis has sustained
a hearing loss for many years.

The pre-entrance medical

exam also indicates that Ms, Davis has some decrease in
hearing.

The pre-entrance medical exam found her physically

and mentally qualified to undertake the nursing program.
QUESTION:

It seems to me then we don’t.

doesn’t say how many years.
twelve or twenty.

It

It could be five or six or

However, proceed.

MR. CHARMATZ:

It has been assumed by the college

that people with hearing impairments which cannot be fully
corrected, people with impairments similar or worse than
Mrs. Davis’ cannot function as a nurse, and it is precisely

I

this assumption which Congress has recop;nized is Incorrect
in enacting section 504 , the assumption that a hearing
impaired person cannot be a nurse.
The federal government employs over 150 hearinp^
impaired nurses and over 300 nursing assistants.
QUESTION:

There is nothing in this record to

show the degree of the impairment of these other 300, is
there?
MR. CHARMATZ:

No, but the audiologist’s report

25
indicates that Mrs. Davis is successful in communicating
with people.
QUESTION:

If she can lip-read, didn't it say

that?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

It said that she can.

But she is only effective if she can

lip-read?
MR. CHARMATZ:

And her hearing aid improves her

hearing.
QUESTION:

She is efficient if she has a hearing

aid and — a-n-d — she can lip-read?
MR.

CHARMATZ:

QUESTION:

That is correct.

The —

And how do you do that through a

gauze that you wear in certain parts of the hospital, a
gauze mask, how can you lip-read?
MR. CHARMATZ:

Well, the Fourth Circuit in this

case vacated and remanded the decision of the District
Court to ask what accommodations could be made for Mrs.
Davis and what accommodations would be necessary that
could —
QUESTION:

And you don't object to that?

MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

Obviously you didn’t --

MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

We do not object to —

No.

But the vacation was not for purposes

26
of seeing what accommodations could be made for her in the
operating room, but in the Southeastern Community College,
wasn't it?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And I understood Justice Marshall’s

question to go to her functioning in a hospital.
MR. CHARMATZ:

Well, from the record we have the

statement of the nursing director at Southeastern Community
Hospital, who indicated that she did not know any area
that Ms. Davis couldn't function given her present deter™
mination to continue her education.

And indeed Ms. Davis

at the present time obviously can't function in any capacity
as a registered nurse, and by going into the clinical
program she attempts to advance her education so that she
could function in areas as a registered nurse.
QUESTION:

Could she under present North Carolina

law be certified as a registered nurse?
MR. CHARMATZ:

We think that we might not have

to reach that question, but the indication is that she could.
QUESTION:

Didn't: the District Court find against

you on that point?
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think the District Court found

that the feelings of the college that she couldn't be a
registered nurse were one of the reasons that the college
refused her.

But the report from the nursing director is

27
very difficult to understand.

At one point It certainly

indicates that there may be some problems for Ms.
no questions about that from the report.

Davis,

But at another

point in the nursing statement it indicates that Ms. Davis
might not be licensed as a licensed practical nurse, and
what has happened since

her application, she has been re­

licensed by the state as a licensed practical nurse.

At

the end, of course, the nursing director for the state said
that they could not predict the eligibility because the
eligibility would be determined on how she does in the
clinical program.
We have also demonstrated in amic briefs that
there are a number of areas where hearing impaired and
handicapped citizens perform safely and effectively in the
medical community, functioning in hospitals as hearing
impaired people.
QUESTION:

Well, when you say you have demon­

strated something in amic briefs, I thought the place you
usually demonstrate something in a lawsuit is in the record
before the trial court.
MR. CHARMATZ:

What I meant to say was that it is

obvious that hearing impaired people can perform in hospital
situations.
QUESTION:

Even a deaf mute might perform in a

laboratory carrying out laboratory tests, where there is no

28
contact with the patients.

Do you acknowledge that there

is that difference in availability?
MR. CHARMATZ:

Well, the question is that Ms.

Davis has performed as a licensed practical nurse where
she is in contact with patients.
QUESTION:

What about the operating room?

MR. CHARMATZ:

The. operating room, again we have

to look at it in terms of the clinical aspects of the pro­
gram and to determine whether or not the clinical aspects
can be accommodated.

The indication Is — and again we have

to see what hearing impaired people are doing —- is that
they are performing in the operating room because they have
received from their clinical instruction, they have received
training, they have received evaluation and they have re­
ceived supervision and this Is -QUESTION:

Are you answering my question?

Mr.

Justice Marshall brought out the fact that she can perform
with a hearing aid and so long as she is in a position to
read lips.

In the operating room, the operating surgeons

wear masks.
MR. CHARMATZ:

The question of whether or not

she can perform in the operating room may be premature in
that we first have to see how she would perform in the
clinical setting.

The question also is what accommodations

might be made to enable her to perform in —

29
QUESTION:
ting?

What do you mean by the clinical set­

Are you excluding the operating room In the clinical

setting?
MR. CHARMATZ:

No.

I think it has to be identi­

fied what are the essential parts of the clinical program
which has not yet been done here and which would be proper
on vacating and remanding,
QUESTION:

Well, is there any registered nurse

program, that does not take the candidates into the operating
room?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

Not that I know of.

You were the plaintiff in this case.

Isn!t the burden on you at the trial stage to demonstrate
what you are talking about now will be demonstrated on re­
mand ?
MR. CHARMATZ:

The question is though —- the

problem was that the college refused to make any modification.
That was their position and the District Court accepted that,
that the college refused to make any modification.
QUESTION:

Well, where in section 504 is there

imposed any duty to make any modifications?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

In the statute —

I am asking about the statute.

MR. CHARMATZ:

The statute does not say.

In the

legislative history of section 504, in the legislative

30
history the same Congress that enacted section 504, the
committee reports indicate that section 504 was meant to
have a requirement of affirmative relief.
QUESTION:

But there is no such requirement in

the language of the statute?
MR. CHARMATZ:
no.

In the language of the statute,

But with the legislative history and also the HEW regu­

lation which has gone through congressional oversight hear­
ings, and again the '78 amendments, there is —
QUESTION:

While we are turned to the legislative

history, we must be confronted with a statute that is am­
biguous.

Do you suggest that section 504 is ambiguous on

this aspect?
MR. CHARMATZ:

We suggest that it is a broadly

worded statute that is similar to title VI and to title XI
and in ™
QUESTION:

Is It clearly worded?

MR. CHARMATZ:

We think in terms of an otherwise

qualified individual, it is one that HEW found required a
number of different definitions because of the different
program activities.

But the purpose of section 504 is to

avoid the exclusion, to make modifications, as found by HEW
and as found In the Senate reports to section 504.

The

legislative history Is that handicapped people cannot be
excluded on the basis of stereotypes and cannot be excluded

31
because of failures to make modifications.
In particular, in one Senate report it states
that special attention must be paid to the needs of those
individuals xvho through no fault of their own have not re­
ceived adequate education.

These individuals, young adults

and adults like, must be afforded the equal opportunity and
access to higher educational services.

The committee is

aware at the present time that most of these avenues have
not been available to people with handicaps.
QUESTION:

Mr. Charmatz, on the question of the

clinical program Mr. Justice Blackmun was asking you about,
the District Court found from the evidence presented at
trial that it appears that it would be difficult and in
fact dangerous for the plaintiff to even attempt the
clinical portion of the training program.

Do you challenge

that finding?
MR. CHARMATZ:

We think that the District Court

asked the wrong questions, that the -~
QUESTION:

Do you challenge that finding?

MR. CHARMATZ:

We can't say that it is -- we do

not allege that the findings are clearly erroneous, but we
think that they ask the wrong questions —- one, an accommo­
dation; and, two, certainly consideration of whether Ms.
Davis as a licensed practical nurse should enter into the
picture.

32
QUESTION:

At the time of the District Court de­

cision , was there a regulation that raised this question
with the District Court?
MR. CHARMATZ:

The HEW regulation was promulgated

in June of 1977 and the District Court hearing was in
October of 1976.
QUESTION:

So the District Court at that time

didn't ask the wrong question;, what you are in effect argu­
ing , that later regulations raise a question that they
should have anticipated, the District Judge should have
anticipated.
MR. CHARMATZ:

That and also that from the legis­

lative history, it seems that you should also consider
accommodation questions which were not asked by the District
Court.
The Fourth Circuit’s decision, a very narroxw one,
decided on statutory grounds rather than constitutional
grounds, recognises that a prejudgment solely on disability
Is Incorrect.

And first the Fourth Circuit is saying look

at the admissions standards, the academic standards to see
if they can be considered, so that we do not screen out
handicapped individuals.

If the decision Is in the affirma­

tive then, we have to look to see if there are program
modifications that can be made.

If the person does not

meet the academic standards, the person will not be admitted.

33
If there is no program modification to be made., then the
person may not be admitted.
But the point is that we have to at least con­
sider those and in this case that was not done.
this approach Is

I think

consistent with section 50*1, its legis-

tive history, and consistent with the HEW regulation.
The college position as found by the Fourth
Circuit was no modification.

They didn’t consider that

issue, and the Fourth Circuit suggested that they give close
attention on remand to it.

At that point there also should

be consideration of the academic standards which were not
considered at all in this case.
I think even the amicus of the American Association
of Medical Colleges recognises that the sole focus on dis­
ability conducted by the college and conducted by the
District Court was inappropriate, because the District Court
did not consider the issue of accommodation and !because the
District Court did not consider the academic standards in
this case.
There is no indication -- in fact, I think the
record reveals that an evaluation of whether Ms. Davis was
a licensed practical nurse did not enter into the evaluation
in this case.
In addition, it would seem that Ms. Davis, as a
person who is licensed for now twelve years, may be an ideal

34
candidate to be able to participate in a registered nurse
program.
QUESTION:

Well, didn’t the District Court find

that LPN’s perform their services only under the super­
vision of someone with superior medical training in the
immediate supervision?
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think that is correct, that they

do perform their training under the supervision of a regis­
tered nurse.

In fact, there is a North Carolina statute

which defines the duties of a licensed practical nurse and
defines the duties of a registered nurse, and certainly the
duties of a licensed practical nurse Include patient care.
There is a degree in responsibility and supervision which
is really the key difference between a registered nurse
and a licensed practical nurse.
QUESTION:

Could I ask, what do you think the

Court of Appeals meant when it said that we vacate and remand
that portion of the District Court judgment which has not
been affirmed here and hold that the college must reconsider
plaintiff’s application for admission to the nursing pro­
gram without regard to her hearing disability?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

I think —

That means that you put that aside

entirely?
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think

35
QUESTION:

That Isn't the way I understand your

argument.
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think it means that you look at

the academic standards first and you see if the person
meets the academic standards without regard to disability.
QUESTION:

And then you look at the technical -—

MR. CHARMATZ:

Then you look at the technical,

your program, and then you see whether or not that program
could be accommodated.
QUESTION:

Well, that isn't what this —- you

don't suggest then that the Court of Appeals, if the Court
of appeals meant to say that it' this person satisfies the
academic and technical requirements she is automatically
admitted to the program?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

No.

Well, if that is what the Court of

Appeals meant, you think it is wrong?
MR. CHARMATZ:

I don't think the Court of Appeals

meant that —
QUESTION:

Well, unless one includes technical

requirements, physical requirements.
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Well, what do you think it meant by

technical?
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think it meant by technical,

36
work experience
QUESTION:

I mean hearing?

MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

No.

No.
It couldn't have or you would be

out of court now.
MR. CHARMATZ:

That's right.

We think that that

is the appropriate consideration.
QUESTION:

Except the HEW regulations I think —

you correct me if I am mistaken -- they define technical as
non-academic, Is that correct?
MR.

CHARMATZ:

QUESTION:

That’s correct.

So that would include physical,

wouldn't it?
MR. CHARMATZ:

Well, we think that that should

be construed in terms of the accommodation.

It would be

silly, for example, to have a lawyer -QUESTION:

Well, it would be helpful If — I know

you think it can be construed that way or the other, but if
technical means everything except academic, it would include
physical, xfouldn’t it?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

If it means everything -— yes.

In which event the HEW construction

would be right in your teeth?
MR. CHARMATZ:

Except that when we look at the

technical we have to look to see if there can be

37
accommodation s.
QUESTION:

I gather you concede then that there

wouldn’t be automatic admission just because academic
requirements were satisfied and the technical requirements
as you understand them were satisfied?
MR. CHARMATZ:
admission.

There would not be an automatic

I do not think the Fourth Circuit opinion reads

that all handicapped people must be admitted into programs.
QUESTION:

Do you agree that HEW construes quali­

fied and otherwise.qualified to be exactly the same?
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think they do.

I think they in­

dicate that they do.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that -- that is not the

way you read otherwise qualified, is it?
MR. CHARMATZ:

Well, we read otherwise qualified

or qualified handicapped person to be one that can perform
the academic and technical standards.
j

QUESTION:

Despite his handicap, his or her handi­

cap?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

Not despite his handicap.

Well, certainly the statute doesn’t

mean that he could do it except for his handicap, his or her
handicap.

It couldn’t mean that.
MR. CHARMATZ:

driver.

It does not mean the blind bus

38
QUESTION:

Mo.

MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

No.

So It must mean something else.

MR. CHARMATZ:

It does not mean the blind bus

driver.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

It means,, If I understand you, that

he is qualified to perform the technical requirements if
the technical requirements were somewhat different.
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry?

It means that he has to be able to

perform the technical aspects of the program if they were
somewhat different than they are.

That Is what it means

under1 your view, isn't it?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

I believe so, yes.

If the respondent had been totally

deaf, stone deaf, would you make the same argument?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

I think that we would.

What level of handicap would cause you

to conclude that 504 was inapplicable?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

I think —

Suppose it was an individual who had

lost both hands, sight and capacity tc hear’.
MR. CHARMATZ:

Well, the initial question would

*

be whether or not he meets the academic requirements, and

39
the second question would be whether or not there can be
any accommodation. to him.

I would doubt seriously that

there could be accommodation in that situation and there­
fore the person would not be admitted,

This is the way we

look at the blind bus driver, whether he could perform the
essential functions of a job as a blind bus driver is the
initial question,

I wouldn't think he could.

And the

second question is whether there can be an accommodation.,
and again I don’t think he could.
The conclusion that we draw in this case is that
a college in this instance was blind to the ability of
handicapped people to perform, such as Ms. Davis, and to
contribute meaningfully to society.
QUESTION:

Suppose it were concluded on remand

that this lady could not perform at all in the operating
room, that it would be — we are trying to see if there
can be accommodation between the demands of the operating
room and being deaf to this degree, and the answer is,
no, there can’t be any accommodation.

But all that means

that she shouldn’t be performing in an operating room.
Would you suggest that she nevertheless should be in the
training program because she can perform in every other
context ?
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think we are.

think we have to reach that issue here —

I mean I don’t

40

QUESTION:

No, part of the training program is

operating room procedures.
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think that if that were the

case, we would say that there are many opportunities
available to handicapped citizens as registered nurses
and they should be able to participate.
QUESTION:

I don’t think —

One of them being laboratory tech­

nicians for which she could qualify.
MR. CHARMATZ:

That’s correct, or the doctor’s

office or private duty nursing or a number of other set­
tings .
QUESTION:

Isn’t this program entitled to make

the decision on the basis of adaptability for any one of
these activities?
MR. CHARMATZ:

Well, again I think that is

correct, they have to check on the adaptability of these
activities.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought you conceded that

she was not adaptable for operating room performance.
MR. CHARMATZ:
point.

I don’t think we conceded that

I think that., given the testimony or given the

evidence of the director of the Southeastern Community
Hospital, and given the examples that are in the amicus
of people who are

severely hearing impaired performing

in the operating room, that that question is open.

41
QUESTION:

Going back to my Brother Rehnquist,

how much of this evidence in the amicus briefs are we
obliged to use?

And I say evidence — or we restricted to

the record?
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think that you are not obliged

to —
QUESTION:

Well, do you go to my second point, we

are restricted to the record?
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think that since the District

Court asked the wrong questions, that the matter should be
vacated and remanded,

I think that you might be restricted

to the record, but Insofar as the record indicates that the
questions that the District Court asked and that the college
asked were incorrect, I think that is the basis for the
Fourth Circuit decision.
QUESTION:

But you have the burden of oroof.

I

mean it is up to you to persuade the District Court to ask
the right questions and introduce the evidence that Is
necessary to support your claim under the law as it is
properly applied.
MR. CHARMATZ:

We have the burden of "«oof, hub

when both the college and the District Court would not con­
sider modifications for Ms. Davis, the only effort is what
she did, she tried as best she could to give the informa­
tion about her abilities as an LPN from the Information

from the hospital that she worked at.
QUESTION:

Mr. Charm.atz, I am still somewhat con­

cerned about the posture of the District Judge when he tried
the case and what your contentions were there.

Did you take

the position in the District Court that the hospital had a
duty or the program had a duty to engage in affirmative
action that would change the technical aspects of the pro­
gram?

I don’t read the pretrial order as describing your

contentions that way.
MR. CHARMATZ:

I think that the inquiry and

testimony was whether or not with adequate supervision Ms.
Davis could perform the duties in the clinical program.
QUESTION:

To complete the educational program

offered by the college.
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And the District Court found that she

could not because there would be dangerous situations.
MR. CHARMATZ:

But the District Court found

that —
QUESTION:

Asked the wrong question, but you

didn’t tell it to ask any other questions, that Is my
problem.
MR. CHARMATZ:
it said that as far as

But the District Court, again,
accommodations ware' concerned or

supervision was concerned, they weren’t going to consider

43
it, and that was the problem of the college.

The college

said, well, with adequate supervision maybe Ms. Davis can
perform but we are not p;oing to make adequate supervision,
we're not going to do that.
QUESTION:

I take It the Court of Appeals thought

the issue was properly in the case?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

At least the way you read the Court

of Appeals?
MR. CHARMATZ:

That's correct.

I want to speak just briefly on private right of
action because it was addressed by the court.

The amend­

ments referred to indicate in any action or proceedinp; to
enforce or charge a violation of a provision of title V,
the court may allow attorneys fees, to enforce or charge
a violation.

In addition, the committee reports indicate

that the committee believes that handicapped individuals
under title V are and will remain In need of vigilence by
handicapped individuals to assure compliance and the avail­
ability of attorneys fees should assist in vindicating
private rights of action.
The Senate committee report in 197-4 Indicated
that there was a private right of action.

The amendments

did not take that private right of action away.
by having attorneys fees and by additional

In fact,

legislative

language by the Senate committee, comments from Senator
Cranston, the floor leader, all indicate that there is a
private right of action.
QUESTION:

Well, inhere do you say the private

right of action was originally created, it was then not
taken away?
MR. CHARMATZ:

Initially in the Senate committee

report in 197
QUESTION:

Well, committee reports don’t create

causes of action, it Is laws, isn’t it?
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:
MR.

That's correct.

And where --

CHARMATZ:

But insofar as the indication of

Congress that they considered that a private right of
action was necessary to vindicate the rights of handicapped
individuals -—
QUESTION:

Some members of Congress, some members.

It speaks through its statutes, not through its reports.
QUESTION:

But you conced that if there is a

private right of action, as you contend there is, it is an
implied one, it is not an explicit one?
MR.

CHARMATZ:

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

I notice you cite —-

QUESTION:

Everybody agrees,, it is not explicitly

in the statute.

45
MR. CHARMATZ:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

You cite Borak v. J. I. Case in your

brief, do you think that case is still good law, after
Amtrak and Cort and Barbour?
MR. CHARMATZ:

Well, we think for the purposes

of this case, for section 504, that the private right of
action should be implied.
QUESTION:

You don’t feel you have to rely on

Borak?
MR. CHARMATZ:

No.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case Is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:05 o'clock a.m. , the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
