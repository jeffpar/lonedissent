MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER :

We will hear arguments

next in Rakas and King against Illinois.
Mr. Weller, I think you may proceed whan you are
ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OB1 G. JOSEPH WELLER, ESQ. ,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WELLER:

Thank you., Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it pleaE® the Court:
Your Honors? the basic issue in this case is whether
passengers who were legitimately present in an automobile when
it was stopped by police have standing

to challenge the

constitutionality of a warrantless search of that automobile.
We advance two grounds for such standing.

One is

the "legitimately present on the premises” rule, and the other
is the "directed-at” theory for standing.
The facts in this case can be briefly stated.

The

two petitioners in this case, Frank Rakas and Lonnie King,
were convicted of armed robbery in an Illinois court.

And the

most significant evidence against them was a sawed-off rifle
which was identified by one of the victims of the robbery as
being the 3area weapon which was used by the masked robbers.
Two robbers in the robbery in question made their getaway from
the sit© of the robbery in a blue Plymouth Roadrunner
was taken from one of the robbery victims.

which

About ten or

4
fifteen minutes later—
Q

Were they found in possession of that car?

MR. WELLER:

The car was subsequently abandoned.

However, prior to that time, the police officer, who was about
four miles north of the robbery site* noticed not a blue
Roadrunner
number.

but a purple Roadrurmer, with a different license

He followed this vehicle to a lounge, saw the

petitioners and two female companions exit and go into the
lounge,

And then he returned to his original site near the

highway to look for the real getaway car since he knew it. was
a different license number.
About that time he heard a radio call noting that
the getaway car had been found abandoned.

So, he considered

the possibility that the robbers changed cars.

He went back

into the lounge, called the sheriff’s dispatcher for a
description of the suspects, was not given a description.
Instead he gave his description of the petitioners whom he had
seen, and he was told that one of the petitioners—who, I
believe, would be Mr. King—matched the description of one of
the robbers.
As a matter of fact, however, we learned from the
trial that the robbers in this case wore ski masks and they
wore clothing different from what the petitioners were wearing
at the time of their arrest.
In any event, this police officer waited until the

5

petitioners left the lounge.

He followed their car down the

highway toward the robbery site.

And it was near the site in

which a number of police vehicles stopped the ear in which the
petitioners were riding and the search in question was
conducted.
Q

Mr. Weller, in your opinion , was there aver an

arrest?
MR. WELLER:

In ray opinion there was not an arrest

before the search.
Q
that*

Wot before the search.

I want to be sure about

You so concede?
MR. WELLERs

Ho arrest before the search.

There was

also no consent for the search.
In any event, during the motion--to--suppress hearing,
both petitioners agreed that they did not own the car in
question.

The car was owned by one of the female companions

who happened to be the former wife of petitioner King.
The trial court decided that since neither petitioner
owned the car, they did not have standing to contest the
search,»

And their motion to suppress then was merely disposed

of on that grounds.
The trial court nor the appellate court discussed
the "legitimately on the premises'5 .rule which we rely upon
here«
Q

That language that you paraphrased at least from

6
our opinion is related to dwelling houses, is it not?
MR. WE'TjLER:

That is exactly correct, and I believe

the issua in this case, contrary to what the respondents9 brief
would suggest, is whether this rule does apply to automobiles.
Q

Many cases have made sharp distinctions between

searches of automobiles and homes, have they not?
MR, WELLER:

I acknowledge that, Your Honor.

However,

the major distinction which has been made between automobiles
and homes is the mobility of an automobile.

And, as a result

of that, it has generally been held that police have a greater
right to conduct warrantless searches of automobiles.
Q

Does it not also rest on the expectation of

greater privacy in the home, in an enclosed home, than in an
automobile?
MR. WELLER:

Recent cases have dwelled upon the point

that there is a lesser expectation of privacy in an automobile.
However, there is ample authority also for the proposition that
that notwithstanding, there is a substantial right of privacy
in an automobile.
Q

If standing is a prudential rule, does it not

make some sense to say that if automobiles are subject to less
rigorous substantive requirements as to search and seizures,
they are also subject to stricter standing requirements?
MR. WELLERs

X do not think so unless you can say

there is absolutely no expectation of privacy in an automobile

7
because obviously we know the owner would have standing—

Q

If you reduce both to zero? I mean, you would

never get an automobile case.

If we are simply talking about

diminished expectations of privacy as compared to a house,
then, would it not make sense to say there are stricter rules
of standing too because we do not consider the interests in
privacy as great in an automobile as we do in a house?
MR. KELLER?

Of course it is diminished.

I was saying, the owner of an

automobile still has standing.

Of course the owner of a house would have standing.
to say that there is a difference between the
the owners?

But, as

Are we

guests but not

Is not the differential between owners and guests

the same in both?
Q

As the Chief Justice just commented, we have

differentiated between houses and automobiles for purposes of
substantive Fourth Amendment inquiries.

Does it not make

sensa to differentiate between them for standing purposes too?
MR. WELLER?

No, I do not believe so because as long

as the right to privacy exists and someone can be the victim

of a Fourth Amendment violation, be it in an automobile cr a
house, he should have standing to raise that issue.
Q

Are you arguing in jure in fact that if at

your trial evidence is introduced against you which has been
obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, you can object
to it even though yon did not own it, you were not on the

8
premises when it was taken?

Are you arguing simply to do away

with standing?
MR. WELLER:
Q

Absolutely not.

X think that would be—

Then what does it mean to say that you are the

victim of an unlawful search?
MR. WELLERs

The victim is one who actually suffers

an invasion of the privacy which ha had, his reasonable
expectation of privacy.

I believe that a passenger in an

automobile does have that reasonable expectation of privacy.
Q

Supposing that the police go to A's house and

search without a warrant and find a letter that has your finger­
prints on it, and you were not in the house at the time the
search occurred, and the letter did not belong to you; none­
theless, it tends to

incriminate you.

Do you think you should

have standing to object to the introduction of that at your
trial?
MR. WELLERs

Hot under the "legitimately on the

premises” rule, which I have advanced.

You have to ba present

under Jones v. Csited States, to have that reasonable expecta­
tion of privacy, to have that necessary interest in the
premises searched.

Q

You have not been a victim of the search then?

MR. WELLER;

I would have to concede that if you are

not present, you would not be a victim of the search.
you are present, you have that expectation.

But if

You have an

9

interest in the premises searched.

And I see no reason to

differentiate between automobiles arid houses.
Q

Would you indicate at what point precisely

this right of privacy you speak of was invaded.

Was it

invaded when they told him to get out of the car?
MR. WELLER:

I think it was invaded when the car

was stopped.
Q

Whan they stopped the car?

MR. WELLER;

I believe it was invaded at several

points, including when the car was stopped.
Q

Where is the first point where the privacy was

invaded?
MR. WELLER:
Q

And then the next time?

MR. WELLER:
Q

When the car was stopped, Your Honor.

When the car was searched.

How about when they told him to get cut of the

car?
MR. WELLER:

That is correct, that would be another

time.
Q

Have not our cases indicated a broad right when

a car is stopped to search the car, search the people?
MR. WELLER:
enough to allow
Q

1 do not believe it is quite bread

a search of a car without probable cause.
As I understand it, the validity of this search

has never been determined by the lower court.

10
MR. WELLER:
Q

That is exactly correct.

And even if we decide in your favor, all yon ask

us to do is to remand it to the state court to determine the
validity of the search.
MR. WELLER:
Q

That is correct.

So, that is not before us now at all.

MR. WELLER:

No, it is not.

I believe that the respondent in this case has
presented an argument which simply does not exist in this case.
The first case that we rely on here is Jones v. United States,
which presented two tests or grounds for standing.

One is

the automatic standing rule, which would be limited to
possessory type offenses, which this was not.

And the second

alternative holding is the "legitimately on the premises"
rule, which we rely on.

That in Mancusi v. DeForte was

stated

to have general application.
Q

Although in fact it was a possessory offense in

Jones, was it not?
MR. WELLER:
Q

That is true, but—-

The dilemma perceived In the Jones opinion—

Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion for the Court, in Jones—was
eliminated in Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion for the Court in
Hixson a, is that not correct?

I may not have the identification

of the members of the Court exactly correctly? that is my
recollection.

But, in any event, the Simons decision

11
eliminated the dilemma perceived by the opinion in Jones; is
that not correct?
MR. WELLER!
Q

That is correct.

And that had only to do with possessory

offenses.
MR. WELLERs

For the purpose of arguing, I would

say it eliminated, although I think since I have not briefed
that point whether it actually eliminated—
G

But with respect to possessory offenses, Simons

made clear that a person did not have to in fact admit
possession in order to try to exclude the evidence? is that
correct?
MR. WELLER:
Q

That is correct.

And that was the dilemma perceived in Jones.

MR. WELLER:

That was the dilemma which was faced

with the automatic standing, which 1 do not rely upon here.
Q

I understand.

MR. WELLER:

I might add that Mr. Justice Harlan

also wrote the Mancus1 *v. SeForte—
Q

Yes, he did.

MR. WELLER:
offense.

—which did not involve the possessory

And in his opinion he clearly notes that there is a

distinction between the two tests.
It would appear to ms that the standing is based upon
what the Fourth Amendment protects,which is the right of

12
privacy, not necessarily property.

Therefore, if one has that

expectation of privacy, he would have standing.
Q

But if you have an expectation of privacy, your

Fourth Amendment interests are implicated, are they not?

I

mean, is that not almost saying.that there is no standing rule
separate from a substitutive violation of the Fourth Amendment?
MR. WELLER?

Certainly if there is a violation of

the Fourth Amendment, one would have to have standing,
Q

What is the point of a standing rule?

The

standing rule assumes that soma people may have a Fourth
Amendment claim that they could make if they only had standing.
MR. WELLER?

I agree with that.

If one is the

victim of a Fourth Amendment violation, ha should have standing.
Q

Then you are arguing for his injury in fact or

doing away with standing.
MR. WELLER:

Wo, because if you are not a victim of

the illegal police conduct, if it was somebody else who was
the victim, you would not have standing or I would not have
standing.

But if you are the actual victim, then you should

have standing.

My contention hare is that my clients were

the actual victims of the police action.
Amendment violation.

There was a Fourth

They ware the victims.

Therefore, they

have standing.
Q

And how again do you define the term "victim"?

MR. WELLER:

A victim is one who had a reasonable

13

expectation of privacy at the time of the contested police
conduct,,

In this particular case they had that expectation

because they were legitimately present in the car.
Q

If they had been found in the stolen car, you

would not be in here, would you?
MR. WELLERs

1 would hate to have to stales that

argument? however, it has been made successfully in a few
courts„
Q

What if they were ten feet away from the car?

MR. WELLER!

It seems to me that if they were that

close, thay might have standing.
I am aware of

I think there is a case that

where one did leave the car momentarily and was

held not to have standing.
Q

Suppose he had never been in the car but he was

just ten feet away from it.

Would he be, quote, "legitimately

on the premises," close quote, as you use the term?
ME. WELLER:
does not apply hare.

That is a difficult question, and it
My feeling is, if he had never been on

tiie premises, perhaps not.

But that is not the case we have

here.
Q

In other words, if you have never been on the

premises, you do not have to decide whether you ara legitimately
on the premises.
MR. WELLERs
Justice Stevens.

I think that makes good sense,

14
We also have another issue in this case which ■
concerns what is known as the directed.-at theory.

Under this

theory, one who has the search intentionally directed at him
would have standing.

The theoretical basis for the theory is

that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful
police conduct.

And the best deterrence would be giving

standing to one to whom the search was personally directed at.
Q

Would not an even batter deterrent be to simply

do away with standing and say that anyone who has evidence
offered against him at his trial that was seised in violation
of the Fourth amendment ought to be able to object to it?
MR. WELLERz

That would be a better deterrent.

However, I think that case law would suggest that some sort of
limitation is in order.
Q

You will argue that next time.».

MR. WELLER:

Perhaps, Your Honor.

If there are no further questions, I would like to
reserve my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Mackay.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. MACKAY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MACKAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
To grant standing to the petitioners here

we feel

15
would constitute a radical departure from the well reasoned
and readily enforceable rule of standing which is currently
based on the right-to-privacy concept*

The dictates of

public policy? we submit? Your Honors? strongly support the
continued application of the reasonable expectation of
privacy standards.

To expand standing? as petitioners would

suggest? under a directed-at theory would simply be to say to
anyone charged with a crime that he

may mount a challenge to

a search which could not have conceivably affected his
personal interest and privacy.

This approach? Your Honors?

wa believe would abandon the traditional rationale behind the
Fourth Amendment cases—that is? the primacy of the protection
of privacy—and would replace? it with a

standard

of expedlency.
Q

What about the guests in the house and the

search of the house; does a guest have standing?
MR. M&CKAYj

Your Honor? in order to answer that

question, X think wa have to look to what reasonable expecta­
tion of privacy the guest had.
Q

You say there is no general rule about that?

MR. MACKAY;

It is our position? Mr. Justice White?

that Simmons or Simons—
Q

You are right? it is Simmons? double Mm."

MR. MACKAYz

Q

Yes

Is it Simmons?

16
MR. MACAY;

I am getting confused.

That Simmons although it—excuse ma.
That .Jones, although it purports to

have language to the effect ‘that one legitimately on the
premises automatically has standing by virtue of that alone
is only dicta in Jones and*”'Q

What if it is not?

What if we thought that was

the general rule?
MR. II&CKAYt

Then 1 would submit, Mr. Justice White,

that this Court should seriously consider abandoning.
Q

Because it might govern the case of the

automobile guest?
■I®. MACKAY;
Q

But if mould?

MR. MACKAYs
Q

Not only that but because—

Yes.

So, if I had a guast in the house and if he had

standing to object to a search? but then we left and I was
taking him home and there was a search in my car, he would
have as much standing to object to the search of the car as to
■the house?
MR. MACKAYs
Q

We do not concede that. Your Honor.

Is it. necessary to make such a general rule?

It depends on what the search was of in the house.

If it was

a search of the guest's suitcase or pajamas or hip pocket,
it is one thing.

If it was a search of the owners of the

house's wine cellar, it is something else, is it not?

Q

I agree that that is

X disagree that that—

And to the extent that is the law, would it be

as applicable to an automobile as to a house?
MR. MACKAYs
Q

Yes, It would, Your Honor.

Is not the real test of standing as to whose

Fourth Amendment right was violated?
MR. MACKAY:
Q

Yes, Your Honor»

And a person has a Fourth Amendment right

against unreasonable searches and seizures in his person,
papers and offsets.

And forgetting about person for a moment

because it is not involved hare—that is an arrest situation—
they are his papers or his effects if he has ownership of them,
title to them, or if he has possession of them.

Is that

/

correct?
HR. MACRAY%
0

That is correct.

If he is a stranger to either title or possession,,

his Fourth Amendment rights can hardly be violated, can they?
MR. MACKAY:

That is correct.

This Court has held

18
that Fourth Amendment rights are private and may not be
vicariously asserted.

To get back to something which I think

is suggested by Mr. Justice White's question—
Q

Or by Jones.

MR. M&CKAYt
0

Or by Jones.

It is the*—

And if Mr. Justice Stewart’s presentation

represents the law, the dictum is obviously wrong.
MR. MACKAYs

That is our position, Your Honor.

But we see a distinction, Your Honors, between the
reasonable expectation of privacy that one enjoys in his home
or in a residence and a reasonable expectation of privacy that
a passenger in an automobile should enjoy.

And it is our

position, Your Honors, that the petitioners here lack a
sufficient expectation of privacy to object, to the search and
seizure as being an invasion of their privacy.
Q

What if the passenger had been, the title owner

of the automobile?

He had been riding in the back seat as a

passenger, but the fact is ha owned the automobile.
MR. M&CKAYs

Then under our argument, Mr. Justice

Stewart, that individual would have standing because his
privacy-Q

His ownership.

MR. MACKAY:
Q

—in that vehicle is being violated.

His privacy was no more violated in the on@ case

than in the other.

19
MR. MACKAYs

I suggest that as the owner of the

vehicle, he has a paramount expectation of privacy in the
contents of that vehicle.
Q

He has a right not to have his automobile

victimised by an unreasonable search and seizure.
MR. M&CKAYj
Q

Yes.

John Smith does not have a right that that

other fellow's automobile not be subjected to an unreasonable
search and seizure? is that not it?
HR. MACKAYs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

It has nothing to do with privacy.

The privacy

interest is the same in both cases.
MR. MACKAY s

We take the position that it is not,

Your Honor, that a passenger in an automobile has a diminished
expectation of privacy.
Q

The paramount—

Is that consistent with your answer to

Mr. Justice White's question that the "legitimately on idle
premises*1 rule for houses carries over automatically to auto­
mobiles?

X thought you said it did?
MR. MACKAYs

Mr. Justice Relinquish, that is exactly

what I responded to Mr. Justice Wilt®.

We are here attempting

to draw a distinction between what the reasonable expectation
of privacy is.

I taka issue with the dicta in Jonas that one

legitimately on tbs premises by virtue of that fact, alone
should be found to have standing.

And I would suggest that

20
this Court roads that to be the law of Jones, that this Court
should then overrule that to the extent that it is inconsistent
with our position.

Yes, Your Honor, Hr. Justice Marshall.

Mr. Mackay, I have to confess 1 am somewhat

Do you think the standing turns on property cbncepts

or expectation of privacy concepts?
MR. MACKAY:

1 believe it turns on expectation of

privacy,
Q

So then you would not differentiate if you had

four people riding in a car at 11s00 o'clock at night out in
the country somewhere.

You would say they all have precisely

the same expectation of privacy regardless of who owned the
car?
MR. MACKAY:

No, because it is our position,

Mr. Justice Stevens, that the owner of the car, assuming he
is present in your hypothetical-Q

Let us take it both ways.

Would you suggest

that he has an expectation if he is not present but the four
people present have no expectation?
MR. MACKAYs

I would suggest, Your Honor, that the

owner of the vehicle has a paramount right of expectation of
privacy to the contents of that vehicle.
Q

Regardless of whether he is present?

21
MR. MACKAY:

Q

Yea .

And the persons present never have an expecta­

tion of privacy?
MR. K&CKAY:

The operator of the car, perhaps on -the

theory of agency—that he is the agent of the driver—may ba
placed into the shoes of the owner, as being a surrogate
own©rf to assert the right of privacy.

That is a problem,

MR. MftCKAY:

X am sorry.

Your Honors, returning again to the degree of
expectation of privacy -that one may reasonably expect as a
passenger in an automobile, wa should take into consideration
that the primary purpose of an automobile, as this Court has
recognised, is transportation.

An automobile seldom serves

as one’s residence or as the repository for one’s personal
■affects or papers.
Q

We have on some occasions observed that an

automobile is also an instrument of criminal conduct—
MR. M&CKAY:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

—which homes may or may not ba but considerably

MR. MACKAY:

And I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that

your comment gives more force to our argument that the rights
of passengers in an automobs.la to privacy are significantly
diminished.

Xs it your submission that nobody but the

record owner of an automobile has standing to complain of a
search or seisure of an automobile?
MR. MACKAYj

Essentially yes, Mr. Justice Stewart,

with the qualification that someone acting as fha owner’s
agent in possessing or driving the automobile would—
Q

Mr. Justice White, that is what we are

The petitioners never alleged that they

were entitled to possession of the car.
Q

But in any of those circumstances you would

think he had standing?
MR. MACKAY:
Q

Yes.

Anybody who is in fact in possession of the

automobile?
MR. MACE&Yt

Yes.

And, for instance, in this case

if tha petitioners were to have demonstrated to the cop that
they were in joint possession, if you want to indulge in such
a concept, 1 would have no quarrel.
Q

You might have a quarrel, but at least you

would have a harder case.
MR. MACKAY:

I would have no quarrel with granting

That is correct.

Only if he is indicted for possession of the

It would not make any difference whether it is bank

MR. MACKAY:

In that case, Mr. Justice Stevens, you

are then talking about a possessory offense, and we bring into
play the remaining language in Jones which has not bean dealt
with in Simmons.
Q

It seems to me, if I understand your argument

correctly, you are saying with reepeet to non-possessory
offenses that standing turns on property concepts.
MR. MACKAY:

You are kind of ashing the Court to go back to

MR. MACKAYs

No, not really on property concepts,

that, but the privacy does not have anything to do with it, as
I understand your argument.

it is present when you are an owner, but there is no privacy
present when you are a non-owner or a non-agent.

So, in the

final analysis, you are making a proparty type analysis but
using the word "privacy55 to describe it, which is a precast
analysis.
MR. MACKAY;
cation.

I will concede that with this clarifi­

I know of no practical way to determine the under­

lying legal fashionable question as to what reasonable
expectation of privacy anyone has in a particular location,
under particular circumstances, without at son© point reverting
to property concepts in order to make that distinction.
Q

You do not think a judge could coma to the

conclusion that when four or five people are riding along in
a car, the car is stopped, and everybody is ordered out of
the car and everybody is searched, that they could all feel
that there has been some infringement of their constitutional
rightsi you do not think that a judge could make that kind of
determination?
MR. MACKAY:

Your Honor, I am not saying that.

If

the individuals have personally been searched, their individual
right to remain free from unreasonable searches has bean
violated, but when the automobile is searched—
Q

If just the vehicle is searched, they do not

have any right?
MR. MACKAY3

That is correct.

Being legitimately on the premises, we submit, without
more is insufficient to confer standing on these petitioners.

26
This concept presupposes that one who is, quote, "legitimately
on the premises" has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
premises and in its contents anywhere on the premises simply
by virtue of the fact that he or she is there.

It is our

belief, Your Honors that this Court, when it decided Jones
v. United States in 1960 did not intend to create such a rule,
notwithstanding the very clear English language contained in
Jones to the effect that the Court was considering two separate
grounds for standing.
I think we must remember that Jones, first of all,
was attempting to define an aggrieved person under Pule 41
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

It dealt with a

possessory offense where it. felt that the vice of prosecutorial
self-contradiction and the potential for self-incrimination
required the Court as a matter of public policy to grant
standing to the petitioner in that case.

The Court in Jones

that the same possession which would grant standing was the
very same possession which would convict.
X might also point out that Jones, which was decided
in 1960, was decided prior to this Court’s decision in Mapp
v. Ohio, which came the following year.

And I just doubt,

Your Honors, whether this Court in 1960, when it announced
Jonas, intended to formulate a rule of standing.
Q

What do you say about Brown v. United States,
Here is the footnote:

"Presence of the defendant

at the search and seizure was held in June to be a sufficient
source of standing in itself."

And then it proceeds to say—

of course in Brown the defendant was not cn the premises at
the time.
MR. MACKAY:

Your Honor, the only way I can answer

that is to refer the Court to the dissent of Justice Black in
Kancusi v. DePorte, where he labels the—

Of course this is a court opinion.

I understand that.

Purporting to say what one of the court

holdings is and announcing what the existing rule of law is.
Perhaps it did not approve it f but it certainly indicated it
was a rule.
MR. MACKAY:

Your Honors, it is our position that if

this Court finds that is the rule, then Jones should be
modified by the opinion in this case to strike being
legitimately on the premises as an independent ground for
standing because because the factors which were present in
Jones to give rise to that are no longer in existence.

We now

under Simmons no longer have the potential for self-incrimina­
tion.

We still have left—

Brown followed Summons.

MR. MACKAY:

That is right.

And, as a matter of

fact, the language in Brown would suggest that the continued
vitality of Jones in light of Simmons is questionable—

Q

Yes, but only on the automatic standing thing

with regard to possession,
MR. MACKAY:

The way I read Brown, Your Honor, is

that it reserves for future consideration the application of
Jones type standing only to possessory offenses.
dealing here with a non-possessory offense.

We are

I think what

the Court is suggesting in Brown is that the Jones type
standing is no longer required in a non-possessory offense.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Mackay.

Do you have anything further, Mr, Waller?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF G. JOSEPH WELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it. please the Court:
Very frankly, I find this case remarkably simple.
It seems to me that all v;e are talking about is that property
concepts no longer apply to standing.

Therefore, the "legiti­

mately on the premises” rule is even more valid today than it
was before.
Q

That leaves us then to decide whether premises

and automobiles are to be equated, does it not?
MR. WELLER:

That is right, Your Honor.

And I am

willing to concede that there is a diminished expectation of
privacy in an automobile.

However, I think it is abundantly

29

clear, both logically and in the Court's opinion, that the
interior of an automobile is indeed a protected area.
Q
whatever?

What if the officers could see the gun or
Is that a violation of privacy for them to look at

it?
MR. WELLER:

1 think we should make a distinction

between what would be a legal salsure or search because of
course you have the plain-view doctrine which would make the
police officer'3 conduct legal.

But perhaps we should still

grant standing of the parson who is present in the automobile
to contest whether or not that gun was in fact in plain view.

that is really a serious problem.

MR. WELLER:

Can that situation coma up very often?

You would assume that this person we are talking about—•
Q

I have seen a whole lot of hitchhikers getting

in cars.
MR. WELLER:

Yas, but can they be incriminated by

something found in that car unless they have some association
with it?

So, maybe you are talking about a very isolated

cireamstanee.

Q

You mean hitchhikers are isolated?

MR. WELLER:

Wo, so far as—

1 have seen an many as ten of them in a group.

MR. WELLER:

So far as raising this issue is concerned,

31
Of course there are many hitchhikers f but I think it would be
rare that a hitchhiker would be incriminated by something found

and 1 also would hasten to add that really we are

not hitchhikers in this case.
G

Do you need this for your case?

MR. WELLERs
Q

Pardon me, Your Honor?

Do you need that Jones statement for your

case?
MR. WELLER:
Q

"Legitimately on the premises”?

Yes, sir,

MR. WELLER:

It was certainly helpful, and I do not

•wish to discard it.
Q

You would have to go to the direcfced-at

theory if you forget about Jones» would you not?
MR. WELLER:

If we concede that there is no

expectation cf privacy, you would have to go to the directedat theory.

I might add bn that point also that in the dissent

by Mr. Justice Black in the Mancusi case he suggested that
perhaps it would be proper to combine "legitimately on the
premises” and "directed-at."

If that would be a test, I think

it would be an extension of what the present test is.

But if

that is a test, we still meet that in this case.
Q

Except Mancus 1 was a building, not a car.

MR. WELLER:
Q

It was an office.

Does the presence or absence of probable cause

MR. WELLER?

That is the issue on the merits, and that has

not been yet decided in this case.
MR. WELLER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Would you still

be making the same issue with respect to standing to conduct
the sort of pat-down search that was approved in Robinson?

Q

Yes.

Would that have been permissible?

Or

would the individual who was patted down after the vehicle
had been stopped with probable cause have standing to object?

I would think so because he first of

all would have to have standing to challenge his being patted
down.
