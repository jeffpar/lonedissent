On behalf of the Appellees

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 77-891, Beal against Franklin.
Mrs. Mansmann, you way proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. CAROL LOS MANSMANN
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS» MANSMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and raay it

please the Court:

I am specially appointed Assistant Attorney General
for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

I served as trial

counsel with co-counsel and husband, Jerome Mansmann, who is
also specially appointed? and we have been representing the
Commonwealth's interests in this litigation since its
inception in 197*2.
The case that we bring before you today involves
only one section of Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act, which
was passed in 1974.

All other challenges and issues have been

resolved upon remand by this Court to the lower court..
In a nutshell, Pennsylvania law provides or
prohibits all abortions after viability except where the
abortion is necessary to preserve the mother's life or health.
This particular section, which is 6(b), is not in dispute, is
not an issue here before this Court.
Q

And the cutoff time is after viability?

4
MRS, MANSMANNs
Q

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct,

Is that defined in terms of length of preg­

nancy or how?
MRS. MANSMANHs

No, if is not, Your Honor.

It is

the capability of the fetus to survive outside the mother's
womb although with artificial aid,
Q

It says after viability, not after likelihood

or possibility of viability?
MRSo M&NSMANNs

That is correct, Your Honor.

In

Section 5(a) , which doe?, not prohibit hut which is the subject
of tills appeal, the physician is required prior to performing
an abortion to make a determination that the fetus is not
viable, based on his own experience, judgment, or professional
competence.
Q

Does that mean that his judgment and experience

must be exercised in terms of reasonable medical certainty?

MRS, MAMSMANN:

Certainly it would, Your Honor.

I

think what the legislature clearly intended there—and it
exemplifies that in the section that immediately follows that
particular phrase in giving an objective standard for
physicians to follow because if a physician in his determina­
tion finds that the fetus is viable—-and here is the offending
language, which forms the basis now of this appeal—'quote,
"or if there is sufficient reason to believe that the fetus
may be viable,” end quota, then the physician must utilize

5

a standard of care—that is, an abortion method—which would
provide for the rights of the unborn child so long as another
method is not necessary to preserve the life or health of the
mother.
Q

Would you say that language also must be read

as meaning that the decision must be based on reasonable
medical certainty as medical opinions are always gauged in
litigation?
MRS. MANSMANN:
Your Honor.

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Absolutely,

And I think the point I am trying to make is that

by adding the wards "or if there is sufficient reason to
believe that the fetus may be viable11 the legislature clearly
intended to say to physicians in this type of practice and
performing this highly specialised skill that an objective
standard will be placed upon them, and that is reasonable
medical certainty.

We are not judging physicians in hindsight

after an autopsy might show that, for example, the fetus
might have been of greater weight or of longer gestational
age.

What we are doing is saying to the physician, "Here is

an objective standard for you to follow.

That is sufficient

reason to believe that the fetus may be viable."
0

May I ask a question?

MRS. MANSMAMN:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

What does "may be viable" add to "viable"?

What is the difference?

6
MRS. MANS MAM?:

Your Honor, In a sense it acids

nothing to the concept of viability.

It does not intend—and

the legislature clearly did not intend—to add an additional
time period.

It is a semantical discussion attempting, as

Mr. Justice Marshall said in Grayned v. Rockford"—we are
condemned to expressing ourselves in language.

And in the

hiatus between law and medicine we are attempting not to carve
out a time period but to say semantically this particular
fetus has the statistical probability that medical science
deals with.

And that probability, statistical probability, is

one of survival.
0

"May be” does not imply probability? it just

implies possibility, does it not?
MRS. MAMSMANNs
Q

No, Your Honor.

Medical statistics—

It does as I read the dictionary arid as I

understand the English language.

It does not say it is likely

to be, it says may be.
MRS . MANS MANN:
Your Honor, we are
tions.

With all due respect to the Court,

not dealing here with dictionary defini­

Wa are concerned with—
Q

But we are dealing with the English language,

are we not?
MRS. MANSMANN:
Q

Of course, Your Honor,

And if something may be so, then it possibly is

so, not probably so.

7
MRS. MANSMANN:

Except that for physicians who

deal with this problem ail the tints, statistical probabilities
is the reasonable medical certainty that they deal with*

Wo

physician will say—
Q

That is not what the legislative language says.

Q

Jure you saying the language means the same ,

that '’viable" and "may be viable’' means the same thing?
MRS. M&N5M&NN:

Your Honor, X do not wish to just

take out the terms "may be viable."

I would like to use the

entire phrase as the legislature did.

If there is sufficient

reason to believe—-sufficient reason to believe—that the
fetus may be viable.
Q

May be, possible.

Q

Sufficient reason for whom to believe?

Does

this mean for the doctor who is c oing to perform the abortion
or somebody looking at it later?
MRS. M&NSMANN:

Certainly, Your Honor, he is on

notice that an objective standard is there, and it puts him on
notice ahead of time.
Q

Let me just be suss I get—supposing he makes

a determination that it is not viable.
fied it is not viable."

He says, "X am satis­

And later on three other doctors say :

he made a wrong determination,

I': might have been viable.

Eov? do you handle that?
.MRS. MANS MAUN:

Your He lor, what we would be judging

8
is not so much that initial determination.

We are judging now

the standard of care he should have utili reel.
Q

So, it is not his subjective determination that

is controlling.
MRS. MANSMANH:

It is his determination with a

reasonable degree of medical certainty, based upon the facts
known to him in judging whether or not this fetus is viable.
And we realise that the whole medical terminology of the
word "viability" expresses a very fluid concept.

It expresses

certainly the potential capacity of the fetus to survive
outside the mother’s womb, what was expressed by this Court in
Rea and Doe, and none of the physicians in the lower court on
either side of the issue disagreed with that definition.

What

they disagreed upon was the gestational age at which that is
achieved.

And this Coart in Danfcrth and the legislature of

Pennsylvania clearly chose not to accept gestational age.
Q

What do you do wit'r the difference between the

small one doctor in the town, in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
hospitals, on what may be?
the word was yesterday?
MRS. MANSMMJMs

Does* t.hat rural doctor have what

The answer is no? is that not right?
If I unc srsfcand your question, Your

Honor, are you saying, "Are the standards of a big cityhospital and a big practice to be

.raposed on some physician in

a small town who does not have available to him, let us say,
a neo-natal center or something ri ht available’''?

Of course

not.

We are judging him by what is available to him»
Q

Doas the statute say that?

MRS. WWSMANN:

Clearly it does, Your Honor,

It

says it judges him by his awn professional competence and
judgment and says, "And if there is sufficient reason to
believe that the fetus may be viable.”

It is our position

that those words are no less unclear to the medical profession
because it is the medical profession—-it is not every
practitioner, medical practitioner—
Q

What happens if you call in three experts,

real experts, and they do not agree?
MRS, MAMSMANN:

Your Honor, it is cur belief tha^

will not disagree, that as far as the viability of this—
Q

My hypothetical is that they did disagree.

What do you do?
MRS. MANSMANN:

I think that there would not be

sufficient evidence upon which to convict in the criminal law,
and that is what the statute calls into play.

It does not

say, "Well, if that is the situation, then a first degree
murder charge will lie or manslaughter will lie."

It calls

into play the criminal statute maintained in that situation—
Q

So, the only way as a doctor I can bs sure is

to get three experts and they all agree?
MRS. MANSMANN:

Is that right?

The question is, Has the prosecution

proven its case against the defendant?

10

Q

Would that not be the only way £ could be sure?

MRS» MMJSMAMN:

Certainly, Your Honor, and I am sure

you probably get experts to testify on any side of any issue»

is one whole distinct problem.

My point is that a responsible

Q

MRS. MANSMANNi
Q

That is right.

and I think tho questions some

of my colleagues have asked reveal some puzzlement as to just
what standard it is the Commonwealth is imposing here.

MRS. MAMSMANN:

With respect to the statute,

certainly it is the objective standard based on reasonable
medical certainty»

When we call into play tho criminal law,

then the criminal law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will
govern with respect to each individual action.
Q

What standard does that law impose?

MRS. MANSM&NN:

It depends# your Honor# upon the

particular facts and what category they fall into# whether it
is a homicide of the first degree# murder of the first degree.,
the third degree, or manslaughter.

Each individual case must

bo judged separately, and that is what this particular
statute was designed to do.
Q

What standard is required for a conviction of a

•physician of manslaughter in Pennsylvania?

Is simple negligence

sufficient?
MRS. MANSM&NN:

No, it is not, Your Honor,

It is

wilful and wanton misconduct, gross misconduct, which brings
about the death.
0

Something more than simple negligence but less

than actual intent to kill?
MRS, MANSMANNs
is precise.

That is precise, Your Honor,,

That

0

That would embrace, wou M it in your view, a

bad judgment?

Suppose you have a general practitioner who

does not specialize in cbsfcetries, but he finds himself in a
situation whore he must make the judgment under this statute.
Is h® not at risk, on the basis of your suggestion about the
experts, that in making the judgment he made, not three but 12
obstetricians might say he was wrong?

And, meanwhile, he is

at least open possibly to a criminal prosecution, is he not?
MRS. MMJSMMfHs

Theoretically he might be.

Under

this statute, judging him, his professional competence and
expertise, what is known to him about his patient at the time,
he would not be in any difficulty, Your Honor.
Q

He might not be convicted, but that is not the

only question that we deal with in a criminal statute, is it?
MRS. MRNSM&NHs

But the real problem hare is that we

keep referring to the responsible physician.

And in the time

period between the invalidation of Pennsylvania's original
and maybe 10G-y@ar-*oM abortion statute—th© in.valida.tion of
that—and the passage of this, the Pennsylvania legislature and

And one conclusion came* to th©

With respect to abortion practice, physicians were

in many respects creating a crisis with medical care in so far
as the woman patient is concerned.

These same physicians

had to test for pregnancy before they would perform an
«abortion.
Secondly, they also bitterly fought any regulation
that would require them to explain th© procedure and the
complications to their patient,

Mo preg­

So, Pennsylvania has come to

the conclusion--the legislature has—that we need legislation
in this area to, first of all, prior to viability, to protect
maternal health.

And now wo are seeing, by the position taken

by appellees and the amicus, as far as being immune from
prosecution in this area, a crisis with respect to the viable
but maybe defective child.

this,

a daily basis understand what is prescribed o£ them.

And we

maintain that for the physicians who deal with this, the
responsible physicians, they understand what the terminology
is.

And I point to the American College of OBGYNs and their

statement twice in the last few years with reference to what
they call ethical considerations in abortion cases.
Q

I am not interested in ethical abortions.

The second provision, which requires

by the lower court.

And although we repeatedly asked the Court

to consider problems of severability and the possibility of

18
severing, if in fact they were correct, that it carves out an
additional time period in which the state has no interest that
is compelling in fetal life, w® ask them to severe the
offending language, thereby leaving intact all the wording
with respect to viable life.

For soma reason, the court

refused to do that and on remand from this Court simply said,
"We stand by our prior position.*5

And we are saying to this

discussion on viability.
And with all due respect to this Court, X do not
think that say of us are in a position to say that life is not'
meaningful because it suffers a handicap.

Our legislature

has clearly chosen to, regardless of handicap or birth defect
or race or sex or whatever, represent the interests of the
viable child in utero, the viable child.

And wa are asking

this Court to recognise that and make a positiva statement

20
with reference to the right of the state , where it has now
chosen, to represent the interests of that viable but maybe
defective unborn child.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mrs. Mansinann.

Mr. Morris.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROLAND MORRIS, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. MORRIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

'the Court:
The lower court in this case chose two distinct if
interrelated linos of analysis with which to approach this
statutory language.

Their first line was based upon an

assessment of the substantive legal architecture which this
Court—mainly through Mr. Justice Blackmon's opiniosis-“has
accorded the abortion question as a whole.
The second line of analysis which the lower court
ezoployed related to that doctrine generally known as the
void-for-vagueness? concept as applied by this Court to its
work.

The lower court found—-and, I submit to you hero,

correctly—-that with respect to both lines of analysis the
Pennsylvania statute failed its constitutional test.
First, it carved out areas in which the state
intruded its interest in the abortion context, which areas
precede that time within which this Court has found a state

21
had a compelling interest.
Secondly, the court found that the statute, as
applied to sn individual, under whatever source you use in
the vold-for'-vagueness analysis, failed to provide sufficiently
precise information with respect to which an individual could
judge his criminal liability—and, I might add, there is a
civil liability concept in this statuta, as you will sea in
paragraph two.
Let me first, if I may, address myself to the
substantive abortion question as it has been described by this
Court.

I think the major two casos, we would all agree, were

Roe and Danforth aa they apply in this case.
here a Meyer case or a Bellcfcti case.

We do not have

We have hare a straight

Roe statute, passed after Roe, which was very similar to the
statute in Danforth.
•

c--

The Court will remember that Danforth also included,
as did the Pennsylvania statute, issues of consent.

But they

are not now before the Court.
The Danforth court likewise was faced with a question
respecting what protection had to be given to the fetus.

And

the Panfforth statute provided, somewhat more sweepingly than
the Pennsylvania statute, that if an abortion ware to b©
performed, the fetus had to he accorded that method of
performance which would most certainly assure its life if it
were viable.

That was the way the Danforth statute approached

22

the situation.

Incidentally, both the Pan fourth statute and

the Hodgson statute provided that if you did deliver such a
viable fetus, for the fact that the parents did not want it
end it provided a sort of an escape clauee—fche state would
taka over th© fatus.

So, the motive was acknowledged by the

statutes
This Court in Danforth held that to require the
fetus to be delivered in that fashion, even though it were in
the first trimester, for example, carved out an area to which
this Court had denied states entrance, and proparly so,
because a state entering an area of individual liberty, of
individual privacy, intrudes as a rather blunt instrument.
And you have laid out areas in concept at least in which a
state may not intrude.

It is these areas which the "aay bo

viable41 language the lower court found—and l submit on the
face of the language, let alone its interpretation--clearly
intrudes.
Q

Are you speaking of an intrusion on th® parants8

rights or the intrusion on the physici mi?
MR. MORRISs
rights, sir.

I am speaking of an intrusion on both

both rights.

I therefore assert

23
\

I think that underlying what Mr. Justice Blnokstun
said in connection with those rights was an acknowledgment
by the Court that as you dealt with this area and that kind of
private consultation, it was probably impossible and definitely
unwise to seek to pull those interests apart for the purpose
of legal analysis.

So, I com© before you asserting both

rights, sir.
1 would like to direct the Courtc s attention, in
connection with the “may be’5 language and what kind of area
it carves into under the abortion architecture, to the actual
evidence of record.

It is not true that there was anything

which could be called a consensus regarding the definition of
viability, let alone "may bo viable.18
The appellee Dr. Franklin in this case placed
viability at approximately 28 weeks.

Dr. Gerstley, who

testified on behalf of the plintiffs, here the appellees, put
viability at about 24 weeks.

Dr. Keenan, who testified on

behalf of the appellants here, put viability at 20 to 26 weeks
and was fairly soft in his judgment.
Dr. Mecklenburg

the lower court read

as fairly

placing viability, or at least a high possibility of viability,
at 20 weeks.

Mr. Morris, X am not sure that these differences

in time periods necessarily reflect a difference in definition

24
of viability, do they?

The statute attempts to define it in

terras of capability of surviving and so forth.
MR. MORRIS:
ed

I give you those, sir, for this reason­

I think your opponent conceded this, that there

were different time periods.
MR. MORRIS s
reason.

I suggest that to the Court for this

I think it is perfectly proper, as the Court has,

to define viability in the sense that it does.

That does not

mean a la Connally or Winters that a state legislature may
take that concept and use that language to apply it to an
individual.

It may not be sufficiently precise for that

purpose, although it may be sufficiently precise for this
Court to use it as a concept which will, in Paico language,
provide ordered liberty.
Q

Is not the only question before this Court now-—

MR. MORRIS:
Q

Yes, sir.

—whether this statute provides sufficient

guidance, informs the. physician when he will be transfgressing
the criminal law, as distinguished from any other liability he
may have?
ME., MORRIS:
Q

Yes, sir.

Is that not the only question?

MR. MORRIS:

1' believe it is, sir.

And one might

bear in mind that if Dr. Franklin avoided a 28-week fetus, he
might well be faced with a subsequent criminal prosecution by

25
Dr3. Mecklenburg and Keenan, who might well fos more articulate
to a jury than he was and who might well convince

that jury

that it was at least wanton disregard, if not knowledgeable
disregard, of life, and he should not be so inhibited.

That

inhibition also applies in the -vagueness concept, that that
inhibition is what is carving out in this—
Q

What if the doctor was attending the mother in

a normal birth and the baby died?

X suppose the doctor faces

the possibility of criminal negligence.

And if two doctors

testified against him at the trial, they might be more
articulate than he was.

That is the standard, is it not, that

is applied in this case, the

same standard as if he were

attending a normal birth,
MR, MORRIS:
Q

You are coning, however, sir—

Is that right or not?

Is that the standard the

statute applies?
MR, MORRIS:
same.

The language of the standard is 'the

The method of its application is different,
Q

That may be, but nevertheless in ail sorts of

situations, including attending a normal birth, a doctor might
be charged with criminal negligence*-™
MR. MORRIS:
Q

Yes.

Is that

right?
MR. MORRIS:

The langxxage of the standards you use is

is different?

May I explain why in application it

We are speaking now of an area that is not only

highly emotionally charged font also of an area in which there
is more*»*
Q

Like attending a normal birth.

MR, MORRIS:

Considerably, sir.

The evidence in

this record shov?s, and the lower court found, a wide disparity
in the time periods, but that is not all one is faced with
when making this judgment, unlike a live birth.

With a live

birth you have and can look at a baby whose chances of living
are reasonably well established.

Here we are dealing with

exactly that period of time when it is impossible, I submit
on this record, to establish the viability, let alone the
"may be viable," and you cannot even look at the fetus
directly, although there are some new techniques which are
providing that.
If I may, sir, bear in mind that the doctor takes
at least four steps, each of which involvas an estimate.

The

doctor makes an estimate.
Q

Are we not talking about, under the statute, if

the doctor makes a determination that the fetus may be viable,
then ha performs the abortion in a manner that would be best
calculated to preserve life.

Is that what the statute

requires?

MR. MORRIS:

The difficulty, sir—oh, yes, it does.

27
Q

But if he snakes the determination that it will

not be viable, then he need not do the abortion in that
manner.
HR. MORRIS:
Q

Yea.

Does he not have another alternative:

If he

determines on reasonable medical certainty that the fetus may
foe viable, he can decline to perform the operation, can he not?
MR. MORRIS:
Q

Yes, and in each of those cases—

But he can also perform it as long as ha used

the methods best calculated to preserve the life of the fetus.
MR. MORRIS:

In both your esse, Mr. Justice Whit®,

«and the case of the Chief Justice, I ask you to look carefully
at what you are doing to that area in which you said the
state should not and may not intrude.
Q

Cannot the doctor always protect himself

though by using what perhaps would not foe so questionable or
arguable— use the aborting method best calculated to preserve
the life of the fetus?
MR. MORRIS:

Is that not what is at issue, or not?
It is at issue, and I submit to you that

at that point in time you are clearly inhibiting, clearly
carving out, an area which may run well into—
Q

That may be, but all you are requiring the

doctor to do ia use that method best calculated to preserve
the life of the fetus.
MR. MORRIS:

In that case, I would have -to ask—

23
Q

You have been talking the entire time about

the decision about viability,
MR. MORRIS:
Q

Whether it is.

But even if that is a difficult question, if he

determinas that it may be viable, he merely has to use acme—
1 know you do not think the word "merely" would be appropriate,

but he nevertheless just has to use that method best calculated
to preserve the life of the fetus.
MR. MORRIS:

I think, Mr. Justice White, the case

which settles that issue is the Danforth case because you could
ask the same question of the Danforth case and say, "Why do we
not just require every doctor to deliver every fetus in that
way which will most likely save th© life of a fetus?"

That

resolves th® entire problem if yon adopt that line of reasoning.
But that is a line of reasoning which the Court has not adopted,
and I submit it would be tragic if they did adopt it.
The countervailing question, the countervailing pull*—
and there are many of course in this case—is that privacy
pull wherever you find the source of it.

That decision that

at com© point should and does under ths decisions that you
have written to date belong to the woman and her doctor.

And

that decision, as Danforth mad© it clear—and I think Roe—
Q

So, you are suggesting that Danforth held that

th© putative mother and th® doctor are entitled to have any
method of abortion they want even though the fetus may b© viable?

29
MR. MOERIS:

Yes, sir.

For one reason, "may b©

viable” io a point which I think the record discloses cannot
be determined in a precise enough way to permit the state with
its panoply of power, its policeman, its judges, to intrude on
that decision.
Q

Would you go so far as to say that the woman,

and the doctor at a certain stage &r© entitled to decide that
they want the fetus to die oven though it might be made
viable?
MR* MORRIS:
Q

How about beyond the first trimester?

MR. MORRIS:
Q

I would, sir, in the first trimester—

Yes, I would, sir, but I do not think—

You have to say that in this case, do you not?

MR. MORRIS:

I do not think you face that issue in

this case, for this reason.

There is enough---you can face it,

and 1 will, and I will go that far.

However, in diagnosing

that particular standard which will support a criminal
statute, you have a whole separate problem.
determine it?
Q

How do you

How—
Would you be making this argument if the statute

ware limited to civil liability?

The statute does say civil

or criminal, as might be applicable in the case of a normal
birth.
MR. MORRIS:
Q

Yes, it does, sir.

So, would you be making this argument if it were

30
just a civil suit?
MR, MORRISs

Yes'r I would, sir, although again I do

not address myself here to that argument.
Q

Mr» Morris.

MR. MORRIS.*
Q

I submit to you—

Yes, sir.

May I ask this question:

If the clause that

includes the "may be viable" language were omitted from this
section of the statute, would that meet your objection?
MR. MORRIS:

No, sir, but on a ground, for a reason,

that I do not believe is before this Court.

I think I sug­

gested a moment ago—
Q

Would the remaining language ba subject to art

attack for avoidance?
MR. MORRISs

Yes, sir, that is precisely where I

would now go with my argument,
q

Would the mare requirement that a doctor

determine viability, in view of all that you have said about
the difficulty of that, present avoidance issue in any of
those statutes?
MR. MORRIS:

It would depend on who idler there were

Are you saying—I want to understand you—that

Yen do not sit her© as a legislature

Under Palco and Griswold I see

your work as defining the concepts.

But that does not mean

the adoption of your language in a statute will satisfy the
requirements of certainty, and X believe-—although this
question is not before you, it having been asked—that a ©tat©
legislature implementing the concept which you have structured
would be required to be more precise than your language is and
would also be required, under Winters-"-and Keylshfan is another
one—to move or weight its language to provide a breathing
space for that privacy right which we are discussing here
today.

Q

Do you think that a doctor cannot be held to the

same responsibility in the performance of an abortion that he
could be held to in the performance of an appendectomy?

32
MR. MORRIS t

I believe that he could be held to the

same perfermance, sir.
0

Would you say there is breathing space necessary

in the case of an appendectomy tco?
MR. MORRIS:

I think, at least in the cases I saw

your question, I was looking to a civil liability, and in the
case of civil liability this penumbra surrounding the Bill of
Rights, this Fourteenth Amendment due process right, 1 do not
think has the same impact; in fact, it has no impact in my
estimation.
Q

How about criminal liability?

MR. MORRIS:

In a criminal liability case, sir, 1

think to the extent that you found it to be a private area-and I would have to think about an appendectomy—I would think
you would have to give some consideration to moving the test,
the precise test, sufficiently out so that, it was clear that
there was a criminal act, so that there was not a vagary of
distinction.

But I do not think that is as personal an area

here.
Q

You say it is clear that it is a criminal act.

I would like to ask you the same question I asked your opponent.
Is the state entitled to make criminal gross negligence on the
part of a physician performing a recognised medical procedure,
whether it is abortion, appendectomy, or heart surgery?
MR. MORRIS:

Yes, I would think so, if it were

precise enough on what the guidelines were.
Q

'/That if a state passed the very same law with

respect to the third trimester?
MR. MORRIS;

If it may be viable during the third

trimester?
Q

The doctor has to make that determination and

then use the best method available to save the life of the
fetus.
MS. MORRIS:

This requires me—and I am quite willing

to do so—
0

Is that vague or not?

MR. MORRIS:
Q

No.

Is that an impossible determination?

MR. MORRIS:

No, sir, but it requires me to take a

step under Roe—and one always hesitates to interpret the
language of Mr. Justice Blackmun who wrote it—•
Q

And

you have been in your entire argument.

MR. MORRIS:

I am trying, sir.

Trying to.

And I

read Roe, sir, originally as requiring a flexible standard.
And you made that clear in Danforth.

As flexible as it is,

whatever line the state legislature draws must be one that is
clearly not invasive.

That is why I answered Mr. Justice

Powell the' way I did.
Q

So, you say in my hypothetical, the third

trimaster, that it would not be vague.

34
MR* MORRIS:

No, 2 think we could establish now,

although I do not believe this record does it*—
Q

Even though a doctor might determine this

fetus will not be viable and two doctors might disagree with
him before a jury?
MR. MORRIS:

I beXiewe-~and I speak extra record

now--that we have reached a medical point# given ultrasound,
inhere a definition placed at the third trimester would probably
stand up and properly so.

I think it would inevitably have to

ba subjected to constitutional testimony at a legislative
hearing and probably in the court.

But I think it would stand

up because I think it is sufficiently definite.
You are making two decisions there.
definite if you can get the age close.

It is clearly

The other decision is,

Have you invaded that area which, I submit tc you, Roe and
Danforfch established as protected?

And 1 think now we can

demonstrate that in the third trimester you would not be
invading that area.
Q

Do you agree, Mr. Morris, that in both Section

5{a) and in the other sections the judgment is one that requires
reading into the statute that it is based on reasonable medical
certainty on what is then known about the subject?
MR. MORRIS:

Yes, 2 do, sir, if what you are asking

me is, Is there an objective legal test as opposed to the
doctor's judgment being controlling?

The doctor’s judgment can

35
be questioned under this statute, and that has never been
questioned by the-”
0

It is the same test, the same general standard,

as would apply to a live birth.
MR. MORRISs
0

Yea.

Whatever standard of care the doctor is held

to there he is held to under this statute.
MR. MORRISx
Q

Yes, sir, I agree.

What is that standard, reasonable medical—

MR. MORRIS:

Reasonable medical certainty.

The

difficulty, sir, is that with a live birth you nave a situation
where it can be determined—
Q

I understand, but that is the standard.

MR. MORRIS:
Q

Yes, sir.

However difficult it might be to apply it, that

is the standard.
MR. MORRISi

Yes.

And when subjecting a man, I

submit to the Court, to a situation which, if he makes the
wrong judgment, invokes criminal penalty, then I think the
judgment must be made at least humanly possible, and I submit
in this case it is not.
Finally, let me turn, if I may, from the area which
is carved out of Roe and Dari forth by the "may be viable"
language—and, incidentally, in Hodgson the Eighth Circuit so
found on the words "potentially viable," the appeal was

36
dismissed in that case—and move then to what I think you must
do on a vagueness analysis.

And I will make this brief, but I

want to call to the Court’s attention that starting with
Thornhill and moving through Connally and Win.ter3 and Keyishian
now, you have clearly when an individual right was inhibited
or circumscribed or threatened held the statute or the state
officer to a high standard of certainty.

It is not sufficient,

when threatening an individual right as you do her® with
respect to both the doctor and the mother, both of which
rights we assert, to say as you might to a state officer,
"Your actions must be constitutional."
state.

You may s&y that to a

Indeed, under civil rights statutes you have convicted

state officers for that.

But that I think you have been

unwilling to say—and X ask you to remain continuingly unwilling
to say—that you may make a private citizen, operating in an
area which may ba protected and which is privata, subject to the
same standard.

And this statute, if any statute, accomplishes

precisely that goal.
1 think Roe suggested the conclusion.
Daaforfch and Hodgson make it clear.

Thank you, sirs.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT 0? MRS. CAROL LOS MANSMANN
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. MANSMANN:

There was a question that underlay &

great deal of testimony in the lower court, and it was a
fundamental,

question, and that was, What really is an abortion?

3?
la it determination of a woman*s impending motherhood?

Or iss

it that, plus destruction of the fetus or viable child?

And

it is our position that with respect to the methods applicable,
the appellees failed to show that there was not a safe method*
But their arguments are all based on what plaintiff, Dr. John
Franklin, said, and that is it is his belief, and h© said,
"I thought about this a great deal, and it is my belief that
the right to live is that somebody wants you to live.

And if

the mother does not want you to live, then the physician should
be able to perform an abortion "—and he meant at any time—•
"for the purpose not just of terminating the pregnancy, but
destroying the fetus as well„"

And I leave you with that

thought and ask yon again to recognise the state’s interest
in the rights to the viable child.
