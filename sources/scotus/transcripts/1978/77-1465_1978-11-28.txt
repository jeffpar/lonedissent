MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-1465 and 77“1491 consolidated,
Mr. Jones, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES * ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO. 77-1465
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case concerns the proper construction of the
benefit provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers '
Compensation Act.

The facts have been stipulated.

In 1973»

William C. Rasmussen was employed by Petitioner Geo Control,
Incorporated, under a public works contract with United States.
Dr. Rasmussen was killed during the course of his employment
and it is undisputed that the Respondents, Dr. Rasmussen's;
surviving widow and son, are entitled to receive weekly death
benefits under the Act.
A dispute arose, however, concerning the amount of
benefits to be paid.

Respondents claim that under Section 9

(b) of the Act they are entitled to receive two-thirds of
Dr. Rasmussen's weekly wages, without limitation, or a total
benefit of approximately «$530 per week.

The employer and the

insurer, however, have taken the position that this proposed
award exceeds a celling on benefits under the Act.

They eon-*

tended, and the Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation

4
programs agreed * that the ceiling on disability benefits set
forth in Section 6(b)(1) of the Act is made applicable to death
benefits as well by Section 6(d),
The dispute came before the Benefits Review Board
which rejected the Director's position,

The Board concluded

that when Congress amended Section 9 in 1972 to delete a fixed
dollar maximum on death benefits. Congress expressed its in­
tention to free death benefits from any ceiling restriction.
The decision of the Board xvas upheld on review by the Ninth
Circuit.
It is our position that when Congress deleted the
fixed dollar maximum on death benefits in 1972 from Section 9
of the Act, they did so as part of an extensive revision of the
Act and that a significant effect of that revision was to re­
formulate and transfer from Section 9 to Section 6 of the Act
the ceiling on death benefits.
As I will discuss, the legislative history shows that
Congress intended to retain a ceiling on both death and dis­
ability benefits, and that the effect of Section 6(d) is to
make the ceiling applicable to both.
In order to place the amendments within their proper
context, I will first briefly review their legislative history
and then discuss the way in which the provisions accomplish
what Congress intended.
QUESTION:

I take it then that your entire case rests

5
on 6{d) ?
MRo JONES:

We believe that Section 6(d) provides for

the ceiling,the application of the 6(b)(1) ceiling to death
benefits.

We rest exclusively on 6(d), except we regard 6(d)

as explained by the other provisions of the Act, of course.
One of the deficiencies the 1972 Amendments were
designed to correct was the inadequacy of the fixed dollar
maximums that were then applicable to death and disability
benefits.

Prom 196I, the maximum limited compensation to $70

per week.

The National Commission on State Worker's Compensa­

tion Laws which was chartered by Congress to recommend reforms
in Workers ' Compensation programs, reported to Congress in
1972 that a substantial percentage of covered workers received
wages that placed them above the fixed maximum limitations.
The Commission concluded that ceilings are justified as a means
of containing the costs of the program and because high-income
employees can and do obtain supplementary insurance from private
sources.

They concluded, however, that in order to keep the

ceilings current with inflation the ceiling should be stated as
a percentage of national average wages, rather than as a fixed
dollar maximum.

And, therefore, they recommended specifically

that the ceiling for disability and death, both, be initially
established at 125$ of national average wager., with phased-In
increases over a three-year period to' an ultimate ceiling of
200$ of average wages.

6
The legislation adopted by Congress in 1972 reflects
the substantial imprint of this recommendation»

Indeed, the

Senate report suggests that the legislation is fully consistent
with the Commission's recommendation.

In particular, Congress

removed the fixed dollar maximum on both death and disability
benefits and amended Section 6(b)(1) of the Act to incorporat©
for disability benefits a phased»in ceiling based on increasing
percentages of national average wages, just as the Commission
had proposed»
If Congress had then simply added an additional
provision stated expressly that the phased-In ceiling was
applicable to death benefits as well, this case would not have
arisen.

Congress did not do that, however.

history shows that in

drafting Section 6(d)

The legislative
though Congress

intended to achieve this result and an additional objective
at the same time.
The Senate and House report® note that in drafting
Section 6(d) Congress was concerned that during the interval
before the Commission's proposed phased»in celling reached its
ultimate maximum of 200$, workers receiving an initial award
of benefits would find their benefits unfairly limited In
future years to the lower percentage celling then prevailing
afc the time of their initial award.
The reports state that the drafters of Section 6
intended -- and I quote:

"To the ©stent that employees

7
receiving compensation for total permanent disability* or
survivors receiving death benefits* receive less than the
compensation they would receive if there were no phase-in.
Their compensation is to be increased as the ceiling moves to
200#."

The language of Section 6(d) gains its meaning from
this expression of Congressional understanding.
provides* in not these words

Section 6(d)

but to this effect* that determine

ations made pursuant to Section 6* which include the determina­
tion of the phased-in ceiling for each period in Section 6(b)(1)
— and now I am. quoting:

"Shall apply to employees or survivors

currently receiving permanent total disability or death benefits*
as well as to those newly awarded compensation during that

period«"
It seems from the legislative history that Congress
understood Section 6(d) to accomplish two results.

It provides

that the periodic determination of ceiling benefits* pursuant
to Section 6(b)(1)* shall apply to survivors receiving death
benefits.

It further provides that as the phased-in ceiling is

increased toward the ultimate maximum of 200# of average wages*
the newly determined ceiling is to be applicable to survivors
and to the permanently totally disabled* whether or not they
received their initial award in that year.

Thus* if a person

were to receive a survivor or a disability award In a year
when the ceiling was 125# of national average wages* three years

8
later* when the ceiling moved up to 200# of national average
wages*, their compensation would be adjusted up to that new
ceiling.
Certainly the language in Section 6(d) can be under*»
stood the way Congress understood it.

The Section cannot ade­

quately be understood any other way.
The Court of Appeals dismissed Section 6(d) as only
referring to the annual computation of national average wages*
which is performed by the Secretary under 6(b)(3) of the Act.
And the court concluded that this computation was relevant only
to the determination of minimum benefits0

The court said that

Section 6(d) merely assures that minimum benefits are adjusted
annually to reflect inflation„

This construction of Section

6(d) deprives the provision of any meaning.
In amending the Act in 1972* Congress adopted the
additional recommendation of the National Commission and provided
in Section 10 that the recipients of permanent total disability
compensation and survivors benefits* the precise people referred
to In Section 6(d)* are to receive an annual increase in their
benefits equal to the percentage increase In national average
wages»
As we discussed in detail in our brief and as the
Third Circuit fully described in their opinion* in the 08K@®fe
case* the Section 10 inflation adjustment accomplishes pre­
cisely the result that the Court of Appeals in this case

9
assigned to Section 6(d).
If Section 6(d) means only what the court concluded*
the Section is surplusage to the statute.

It is* of course*

the Court's responsibility to give meaning to every word and
clause of the statute where possible.

And this is especially

true* we submit* in a situation such as this* where the legislative history reflects that the section was intended to have
an active role.

That role Is articulated in the Senate and the

House reports which state their understanding that the adjust-»
menfc under Section 6(d) will make the redetermination of the
phased-in ceiling on disability benefits applicable to both
classes of beneficiaries.
QUESTION:

I suppose you must concede that Congress*

as is so often the case* could have drafted it a little more
intelligably?
MR. JONES:

We* indeed* wish it had.

I think that

the basic problem is that Section 6(d) -- Congress tried to do
too much.

I think the legislative history reflects though

what Congress® understanding of what it was doing — and even
though the language is ambiguous* the expression of congres­
sional understanding should be controlling.
The Respondents claim that —
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones* while you are interrupted*

where is Section 10 in the brief?
MR® JONES:

It is on page 16 of our brief in fchs text

10

Its effect is discussed in our brief on pages 30 and 31 and in
the O’Keefe case# I believe# it is discussed toward the end of
the opinion.
QUESTION:

It is cited as 10(f).

MR a, JONES:

Well# 10(f) and 10(h) are both relevant#

as we discuss briefly in our brief,

10(f) applies the annual

inflation adjustment to the recipients of benefits who received
their initial award following the date of the amendments.

10(h)

requires that the same adjustment be made for persons who re­
ceived their awards in prior years.
QUESTION:

Do you quote 10(h) in your brief?

MR, JONES:

10(h)# as you can see# is a compendious

provision, but the provision that is relevant in this regard is
10(h)(3)# which is at the bottom of the right-hand column on
page 31# which makes subsection 10(f) applicable to awards of
benefits prior to the effective date of the amendments.
Respondents say that the language in Section 6(d) is
ambiguous and that because of the remedial nature of the act
that the statute should be construed In their favor.

We# of

course# agree that the Act is remedial, but the question here
is what the purpose of Congress was in enacting this legislation
There is certainly no general remedial policy that's
ever been expressed that favors unrestricted ceilings on workers
compensation benefits.

The consistent course of state and

federal legislation in this area has been to provide equivalent

11

celling limitations on both permanent disability and death
benefits.
The few states that have departed from that consistent
course have provided higher ceilings for disability and for
death benefits.

I think that reflects the underlying objectives

or rational® for the ceiling restrictions.

Ceilings have con­

sistently been understood as justified by the need to contain
the cost of the program and because high-income employees can
and do obtain insurance to protect their supplemental needs.
Death is the risk that's most often insured against,,
as the brief submitted by Petitioner Geo Control notes, approxi­
mately 95$ of upper income employees obtain death insurance.
So, if Congress were concerned with a choice as to which —
where the remedial need were greater, they would presianably
have concluded that disability was the greater need.

j

Moreover, the need of the family is greater when the
i

benefit must support not only the family but the disabled worker
as well.

\
In the light of all of these concerns, I think,

,

i x
I

Chief Judge Wright was correct in the Boughman ease in stating
that it would have been anomalous for Congress to have left,
departed from that consistent remedial understanding, the con­
sistent treatment of death and disability benefits, without
'.s

ever so stating.
'•-***

-i

I would like to note that the legislative history on

\

12

which the Court of Appeals relies for its contrary conclusion
simply doesn't focus on the question that is presented here.
The portions of the committee reports that the Court of Appeals
refers to state only the literal effect of the amendment to
(Section 9* by stating that the fixed dollar maximum on death
benefits was removed from that section.

It was* of course,

necessary to remove the fixed dollar maximum on death benefits
from Section 9 to allow the substantially higher ceiling benefits
established in Section 6

to have effect.

Moreover, the state-

ment of the literal effect of the removal of the fixed dollar
maximum from Section 9 follows the Committee's explanation that
the phased-in ceiling in Section 6 will be applicable to both
the permanently disabled and to survivors.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, isn't it correct that if you

were drafting the statute and you wanted to substitute a dif­
ferent maximum on death benefits, you would have put It In the
new 9(a)?
MR, JONES:

I think that if I had done it the

simplest way would have been to add it to 6(b)(1), rather than
to have an entire additional clause paralelling 6(b)(1) -could have added the words to 6(b)(1).
QUESTION:

Don't you think they ought to just put it

back in the same place it came out of before?

It seems to me

when I read 9(e), I said, "Well, gee, they just left something
out here," If that's what you meant.

13

MR, JONES:

No, I think that the legislative history

suggests that what Congress thought it was doing and what it
Intended to do in Section 6(d), was to bring into Section 6
the limitation on death benefits because of the economy.

If

you look at Section 6(b)(1), it is a fairly good sized provision,
and to repeat the provision entirely in Section 9 would have
served no purpose that isn't served just by referring to the
Section 6(b)(1) limit and making it applicable in Section 6,
itself, to death benefits,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bennett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT H. SENNETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN NO. 77-1491
MR. 3ENNETT:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Albert Sennefet and I represent Geo
Control and the New Hampshire Insurance Company.
The task of statutory construction is one of discern­
ing the intent of the legislature.

We submit that the intent

of Congress in this particular matter, to provide the same
maximum limits for disability and death benefits, can be discerned from the following considerations.

I: "

Both bills, Senate Bill 525, introduced in the 92nd
Congress, and House Bill 3505, introduced in the same Congress,
provided for identical maximums.

The report of the National

Commission of State Workmens' Compensation Laws recommended the

»

14

same maximum weekly benefits for disability and death benefits.
And the report accompanying Senate Bill 238 states that the
Committee believes that the provisions of the bill presented are
fully consistent with the recommendations of the National
Commission in its report issued July 21, 1972.
As my brother has stated, the reference in 6(d) of
the Act to death benefits and disability benefits is also a
fact to be considered by this Court.

This coupled with the

fact that 10(f) of the Act makes all the adjustments necessary,
makes the only separata, independent meaning to 6(d) as pre­
sented to this Court a few minutes ago.
The fact that the identical maxlmums are fully consistent with all state workers compensation laws is another
fact to consider.

The concept of payments to injured workers

who have been deprived of their wages by reason of industrial
injury is a concept to provide replacement of wage loss.

The

consideration for replacement of wage loss, in return, calls
for some limitation in the upper limits cf liability of the
employer.

This has been consistent with the type of trade­

off and type of political bargaining process that is the history
of this Act and the history of every other state workers com­
pensation act.
It has generally been felt, and we believe it is
demonstrated again in this particular series of sections, that
the upper limits are the places where the cutoff becomes
<■4 i j , . .

i

15

effective* the theory being that the higher paid employees are
capable of providing against the impact of death* capable of
providing against the impact of disastrous losses to their
families»

The concern Congress showed in this particular

instance was for the lower paid employees and the impact of
-

",

-

_

-

•

;

-a

this particular act guarantees certain basic returns to lower
paid employees which were not present in the old act.

And that

seems to be the major thrust of many of the changes that were
promulgated in 1972.
'

;

-

'

■■

- .!

The fact is that if Congress wished to depart from
this traditional and historic and consistent pattern it would
appear that some very clear expressed statement had been made
with respect ;o the law.

Basically* the Respondent's position

here is an attempt to interpret the fact that in one section of
the Act there is an omission with reference to these benefits.
The other point that I wish to take in a few minutes
that 1 have left is that the argument advanced in the Respondent
brief at page 28 suggests that the no-ceiling limit is justified
in industrial deaths because this represents only approximately
1'% of all industrial injuries* and perhaps some special excep­
tion would be required.
The fact of the matter is that death benefits are
defined under Section 9 of the Act* as applying both to deaths
which occur directly as a result of industrial injury* as well
as death® which occur by reason of unrelated causes* if at the

16

time of the person's demise he is suffering a permanent and
total disability.

This is a much larger class of people and

would give an even increased anomalous situation than the one®
that have been demonstrated in the briefs.
In sum then, we respectfully submit that in light
of the consistent pattern of providing for maximum limits* in
light of the fact that this is a compensation system meant to
replace wage loss* there would be no consistency and no logicin assuming that Congress intended to depart from the traditional
way of solving compensation loss cases and substituting them
with an entirely anomalous situation.
I intended to reserve about two minutes for rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BU.RGER:

Very well.

Mr. Qstmann.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BUCKLEY OSTMANN* ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. QSTMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
We believe that there are really tv/o questione in
V- . r

this case.

One* did the Congress eliminate the death benefit

maximum payments from the statute in the 1972 Amendments?

And

if they did so* was the elimination a conscious and deliberate
act?
Respondents answer both questions yes.

Yes* the

Congress did eliminate the death benefit maximum payments from

17
the Act and yes the elimination was a conscious and deliberate
act by the Congress.
Whan the statute is read as amended# one thing is
apparent.

In no section :Ls there a clear death benefit maximum.

In Section 9# where the death benefit maximums had been set
out traditionally and exclusively# specifically at 9(e)# it has
been eliminated# excised from the statute.
At Section 6(b)# there are maximums set out# phase»
in maximums# but they are applied only to disability# by the
clear language of 6(b).

Section 6(d) does mention both death

benefits and permanent total disability# but does not contain
any maximum.

It doss have a purpose# we submit# which we will

discuss in a few moments.
Because there had been some obscurity in Section
6(d) and because eliminating death benefit maximums is a
departure from this Act's history# and in fact from general
Workmens* Compensation# prior tribunals have looked at the
legislative history to determine what the intention of Congress
was.
In the legislative history# it is important to note
that from the very beginning# when S. 2313 was first introduced
by Sanator Eagleton, maximums for disability and death were
excised from the recommendations.

No mention whatsoever made

of any maximums for disability or death.
Further# from the beginning of the hearings in this

18
matter, Senator Eagleton stated in his opening remarks that
S. 2318 "would eliminate the maximum payment limitations*"

And,

further, from the beginning, there was no doubt among all the
witnesses that testified before that Committee, as to the effect
and the intent of S. 2318»

,*.

^ vm

Needless to say, there was much testimony on this
proposal*

It was discussed by Judge Devaney in his decision

and order and also In our brief.

The industry side, of course,

opposing it, labor side generally thinking it was advisable.
Following that testimony, a revised 2318 was submitted.
It was substantially rewritten.

Section 6(b)(1) created a new

maximum for disability, based on an increasing national average
weekly wage, and it had a phase-in of this new maximum.
Section 9 was also rewritten.
and it was not forgotten.

It was not overlooked

Specifically, at Section 9(e), for

instance, a new minimum was inserted by the revised 2318, which
was tied to the national average weekly wage, a term added to
the revised S. 2318.
We think when the original 3. 23l8's version of
Section 9(e) is seen and read and is compared to the revised
S.2318 version of 9(e), which was enacted into law, the reader
finds a striking similarity.

In fact, the sections are almost

identical, except for changing the basis for the minimum bene­
fits in death from a dollar figure to the national average
weekly wage.

3.9
Respondents submit that it is beyond reason to gay
that Congress somehow suffered scans sort of a collective
amnesia and forgot what the original 5. 2318 meant* forgot what
Senator Eagleton said it would accomplish and forgot the
tremendous amount of testimony from the witnesses that de~
scribed the very Intent aid action of S. 2318.
Rather* it is far more sensible and logical to say
that the Congress realized what it was doing and that it consciously and deliberately did not add a maximum in Section 9(e).
Stepping back for a moment in the legislative history*
just before revised S. 2318 was written an important event took
place.

And that was the report of the National Commission on

State Workmen’s Compensation Laws.
President and to the Congress.

It was submitted to the

This report was a comprehensive

study of state workmen^

compensation systems* and it made

certain recommendations

for what it thought provision should be

in this field.
As with any other commission* there are many members*
many different viewpoints.

And this is seen when one looks

behind the recommendations to the discussions that led up to
the recommendations.

For instance* when maximums and minimum®

were discussed by the Commission* there was found to be only
an uneasy case for those.

And of the two* the Commies ion found

maximums to be the more troublesome.
QUESTION:

Did the Commission distinguish between

20

maximums and minimums for disability and maximums and minimums
for death benefits?
MRo OSTMANN:

When they discussed maximums and mini­

mums at the beginning of the report# there was no distinction
made.

That portion of discussing the advisability of maximums

and minimums# the report# I believe# had application to both
death and disability.
QUESTION:

Did they later make any distinction?

MRo OSTMANN:

We believe they did.

We believe that

there were some comments made that I am going to get to in a
moments where the report discusses death in a manner different
from disability.
For instance# in the opening paragraph on death
benefits, the Commission makes an interesting comment.

It says

that death is the ultimate work related tragedy and deserves
full compensation.

Now later, of course# they reach the con­

clusion that the same maximum, in their estimation# should
apply.

But that statement was their opening statement with

respect to death benefits.
No similar statement was made with respect to dis=
ability.

Later, in discussing the proportion of the wage that

should be replaced In death cases# the Commission discussed the
advisability that# perhaps# a higher percentage of the average
wage of the deceased should be replaced in death cases# basing
it on the incentive argument.

The incentive argument being

21

that when a worker is disabled it is good for him and it is
good for society# and it is good for the industry, if this
individual is encouraged to get back to work and be productive
again.

Because of that, that is one reason why benefits are

limited in Workmen’s Compensation to a percentage of that wage.
Now, the Commission did end up, as I said, recommending
the same percentage.

But we believe that this discussion is

important because this discussion was part of the legislative
history.

It was something that the Congress read and must have

considered when it revised 2318.

And it also establishes some

discussion# some reason for having benefits higher in a death
benefit case then in a disability case.

The rationale is there.

Further# as Judge Devaney pointed out# the recommenda­
tions of the National Commission with respect to death and
disability were minimum recommendations only.

Prior to each

percentage that they recommended that are cited in the briefs#
the Commission said the benefits should be at least this much.
QUESTION:

Is it true that a death benefit could be

lost by a widoxv's remarriage in a fairly short period of time#
whereas# a disability benefit could continue for a rather in­
definite period of time?
MR0 CSTMANN:

That's correct.

If a widow remarries#

she receives a lump sum payment and after that she gets no
further death benefits.

And the disability# of course# could

continue as long as the disability exists# permanent total

22

disability.
There is a final important point about the National
Commission’s report.

It has been argued here that with respect

to death benefits the Congress intended to follow rather pre­
cisely the recommendations of the National Commission.,They cited something from the legislative history, saying that
the new act, the '72 Amendments, were fully consistent with the
National Commission's recommendations,

implicitly then that

the Congress did not intend to go beyond the National Commission
recommendationso

However, there is another section in the Act,

as amended, that disproves this argument.

It was mentioned by

Mr, Sennetto
In Section 9 the first sentence says, "If the Injury
causes death or if the employee who sustains permanent total
disability due to the injury thereafter dies from causes other
than the injury, the compensation shall be known as a death
benefit."
It is our submission that that ia a radical and even
revolutionary concept in Workmen's Compensation.

To say that

the survivors of a permanently totally disabled worker will get
death benefits, though that worker dies of a cause totally un­
related to his Injury, is a drastic departure.

And yet it is

in this Act.
QUESTION:
from that, Counsel.

I am not sure what you want us to draw

23

MRo QSTMANN:

I think what's important about that is

that that concept was not recommended by the National Commission*
was not even discussed by the National Commission.

The National

Commission defined death benefits as payments to survivors of
a worker who dies "as a result of a work-related injury or
disease."
QUESTION:

Mr. Qstmann* on that point* if a person die®

while he is receiving permanent disability benefits* under the
statute section you just read* would that disability benefit be
converted into a death benefit?
MR. QSTMANN:

I wouldn't say it is «exactly converted.

They are two separata benefits.

At the point of his death* he

would no longer receive permanent total disability benefits and
if he had survivors, a wife or children, or both, they would
receive death benefits under the Act.
QUESTION:

If he was in a high enough weekly wage

the benefit would rise.
MR. QSTMANN:

That's correct.

Respondents submit that this language I just mentioned
from Section 9, which is another example of the Congress here
treating death benefits in a more expansive way than they had
been treated before* conclusively establishes that the Congress
did not intend to be bound by the recommendations of the National
Commission, but rather intended to go beyond those recommendations
and to establish what Senator Williams called "the first serious

24

step towards reform of our society's Workmen’s Compensation laws
in the past fifty years»"
Turning to Section 6(d), this section has received a
tremendous amount of attention in this litigation.
would submit that attention is misplaced»
it is read, contains no maximum.

Respondents

Section 6(d), when

That much is clear»

However,

we believe that Section 6(d) does have a purpose and our feeling
about that purpose is different from Petitioners*.
V/e believe that Section 6(d) Is designed to say that
only two classes of beneficiaries will receive the benefit of an
increasing national average weekly wage, under this legislation.
We believe that, in effect, it states its point conversely,
namely, that the lesser classes of disability do not get the
benefits of an increasing national average weekly wage.

We

believe that this point can be best illustrated by using the
example of a high income, temporary, total disability indivi=
dual.

If he is injured today, his benefits are easy to calcu­

la te»

There is a national average weekly wags in effect,

benefits are limited to 200$ of that national average weekly
wage.

It is a mathematical calculation.
Now, if a person has the same injury, a temporary,

total disability recipient, next year, during the next period,
and he is high income, again, there is no problem figuring him
benefits.

It is the same function.

The only difference would

be that because the national average weekly wage has been going

25
up because of our Inflationary society# his benefits will b®
higher.
The question becomes what happens to the first
example?

If his temporary disability extends to the next

period# does he get an increase in benefits or do his benefits
stay frozen at the level when they are awarded?
Section 6(b) does not really explain that.

Section

6(b) recites 200% of national average weekly wage is the maxi­
mum.
We believe it could be read either way# that ye©
everyone goes up if their benefits are based on a national
average weekly wage.

Or it could be read that they are frozen.

It is an unclear point.
Section 10(f), mentioned by the Government, does not
apply because it only concerns by its very nature permanent
total disability and death benefits.

It is designed to clarify —

its a mathematical section— stating just how those two classes
of beneficiaries will have their benefits enhanced.
We believe that Section 6(d) is in there to clarify
that the temporary total disability recipient will not get
any increases,

There is no doubt that the section is obscure,

it dossn3t state its point precisely.
reading gives the section meaning.

We believe that that

We believe it clarifies a

point that is not clarified otherwise.
QUESTION:

But# Mr. Qafcmanm# if the exclusion of

26

temporary disability beneficiaries from the language of 6(d) is
intended to exclude them, why wouldn't the same rationale apply
to Section 10 aa well?

If that refers only to permanent and

death and fails to mention temporary, why do you need the (d)?
MR0 QSTMANN:

We believe that 10(f) is in there to

show that all recipients of permanent total disability and death
benefits will get the benefit of an increase because, without
that section, the only Individuals that would get an increase
would be those whcge benefits are figured on the national
average weekly wage.

In other words, the middle range reeip°

ients -QUESTION:

I understand that, but wouldn't 10(f) of

its own force exclude temporary disability recipients from any
increase?
MR. QSTMANN:

It would, perhaps, exclude the entire

range of them, but we would say, without 6(d), the question
would still be open in minimum and maximum situations.

Where
i
.{

the benefits are figured in disability on the national average
weekly wage, we don't think the point is clear from 10(f).

Wf

i
believe in those instances there might be a question open as j
to whether or not an increase should be granted, and w@ believe
that is why 6(d) is in the statute.
QUESTION:

1

\

Mr. Qstmann, if there is a redundancy between

the two sections, do you think that your case is demolished?
Or can you live with redundancy?

27
MR0 06TMANN:

Wall# I could live with redundancy#

Your Honor*
QUESTION:

It's a question whether we can.

MR, OSTMANN:

Yes# that's certainly the question*

We don't believe that there is redundancy though.
have tried to find a reason for 6(d).

We

It hasn't been easy# but

we believe that this Is the purpose of the section.

We don't

believe that 6(d) and 10(f) are Identical.
QUESTION:

There is one strange thing about 6(d).

It refers to determinations under this subsection.

What sub*»

section do you understand that to refer to?
MR. OSTMANN:

I believe# as everyone in the case has

agreed# that that was an oversight# that should refer to Section
6# because in the bill it was a subsection.
QUESTION:

I suppose# Counsel# you have read some of

published articles of members of the Congress which would hardly
support your suggestion that really members of the Congress knew
what was in this statute and how the statutory scheme would
work.

These experienced members of Congress who have written

published articles say they simply haven't the time to look
at it.
MR. OSTMANN:

Yes# Your Honor# that is true.

However#

we believe that when the entire legislative history is read
here the choice is to go, what the Government called# "the
tortuous route"of finding through a myriad of provisions a death

28
benefit maximum.» or to declare that the Congress eliminated it.
QUESTION:

They couple that argument# as I get it#

either expressly or by implication ~~ that this tortured route
takes them to what is the sensible and reasonable solution# and
that any other route does not produce a sensible and reasonable
solution in light of the total purposes of the Act.
MR, OSTMANN:
Honor,

We would not agres with that# Your

We think it is important to realise that at the beginning

S. 2318 intended to remove all maximums,

True# when revised#

we believe that there was a compromise# that a new maximum was
inserted in disability# but that the Congress decided in death
cases# because it is a different class of benefits# because
there is no Incentive argument# which is one of the reasons for
a lower level of benefits, that with respect to those the
families of workers they shouldn't be fettered with an arbitrary
ceiling.

The family of a high-income worxer should be able to

live in the method that they have been accustomed to.

And

that’s more beneficent and more humane than treating them in
any other way.
QUESTION:

Mr. Qsfcmann# at the hearings# before the

revised 2381 or 2318# whichever was proposed# how much testimony
was there in support of the view that there should be no maximums at all?

Was there a significant amount of testimony?

MR, Q6TMANN:
effect# Your Honor.

There was substantial testimony to that

The labor side# for instance# was supportive

29

of that proposal.
QUESTION:

Cutting through all the language, your

basic position is that, even though it doesn't appear in the
legislative reports directly, that there must have been a com­
promise between the two facts, and they said, "Okay, we will keep
the celling on disability and take it off on death."
MR, GSTMANN:

Yes.

We believe that, for instance, the

National Commission’s discussions of death, In a different
light, indicates that.

The citation of the enhanced definition

of death benefits was something els® that was added now.

That

wasn't discussed in the National Commission, nor to my knowledge
was it proposed by anyone before the Congress in testimony.

Yet

it was added and it’s definitely a clear provision.
QUESTION:

What if we were to conclude that the

statutory language is absolutely clear, that disabilities do
have maximums and death benefits do not.

But we were also to

conclude that we can’t think of any conceivable reason why
Congress would do that,
MR. QSTMANN:

Should we affirm, or reverse?
I would say affirm, Your Honor, because

I believe the function of the Judiciary is to determine what
the statute says and what the Congress Intended,
We believe that if this Court is going to find for
Petitioners it will have to, in effect, rewrite this section,
because there is no death benefit maximum set out anywhere in
the statute.

This language would effectively be Inserted.

30

QUESTION:

Having no reason wouldn't be as bad as

having an unreasonable reason* would it?
MR0 GSTMANN:
QUESTION:

Well* either one* Your Honor.

Either way* you win.

MR. GSTMANN:

In any avent* in our estimation, 6(d)

is designed to establish that the lower classes of disability
are frozen at the level when they are awarded.
The statutory construction of this statute has always
been beneficent of purpose liberally construed in favor of the
worker.
QUESTION:

Was this part of the *72 amendments, where

there were some trade-cliffs on both sides?
MR. OSTMANN:
QUESTION:

Ye®.

Well, then, why do you talk about this

being beneficently construed and liberally construed toward the
worker?

It was a give and take thing with the unions on one

side and management on the other.

There is no reason why this

Court should favor one over the other, is there?
MR. OSTMANN:

I think, historically, the development

of workmen's compensation has been to benefit the worker.
QUESTION:

That may be true, historically, but, as I

understand your response to my question, there was just some
pretty hard-nosed bargaining in 1972 and management was on one
side and labor was on the other.
MR. OSTMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor, but the

31

benefits were enhanced.

For instance, the unseaworthiness

doctrine was removed as an alternative remedy.

That was one of

the trade-offs, and there were others.
How should we construe the removal of the

QUESTION:

unseaworthiness doctrine, beneficently, remedialiy?
MR. QSTMANN:

We believe that when the statute is to

be construed by the courts it is to be construed in favor of the
worker and his family, because that has been the historical
purpose of workmen's comp, to create a liability without fault
against the employer.
QUESTION:
worthiness remedy?

How about the elimination of the unsea­
How should that be construed?

MR, GSTMANN:
Your Honor,

I think that's a very clear elimination,

I don't think there has to be any construction at

that part of the statute.

That's not at issue and 1 don't think

there is any question,but the unseaworfchiness was eliminated by
this Act.
QUESTION:

Because it just didn't make sense.

MR, QSTMANN:

In a sense, it created dual remedies for

the workers, that is correct.
It has been said that to remove death benefit maximums
is too radical, too drastic to not have been intended.

We be­

lieve, though, as I just mentioned, that the statute had been
radical from the beginning, that there are other radical changes
in this Act designed to enhance benefits for workers.

Further,

32

such questions are questions of degree and questions of policy
which we believe are more properly presented to the Congress
rather than to this Court.
In conclusion# when reviewing the entire record
surrounding the '72 Amendments# we believe that it becomes clear
that Congress intended to truly modernize this statute and to
truly bring benefits and benefit levels up to a reasonable
state# and that as a part of this reasonable and beneficent
amendment of this Act# the Congress consciously and purposely
eliminated any artificial limits on the payments to the families
of deceased workers.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sennett.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT H. SENNETT# ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN N3, 77-1491
MR. SENNETT:

By way of brief rebuttal# I find myself

largely in agreement with the former speaker that the Act has
beneficent purpose.

The intent of Congress is clearly indicated

in the Act and that is to increase benefies substantially.
However# I've heard no presentation to this Court#
and I have seen none in the briefs presented and I've seen none
in the history we've studied which can offer some rational
analysis or logical distinction as to why there should be a
differential between disability benefits and death benefits,
QUESTION:

Mr, Sennett# can I interrupt you there.

33
Supposing — It would have been logical -- Some Senators,
Senator Eaglet on and others, thought it would have been logical
to take the ceilings off entirely, if there is a case for that
position.
MR. SENNETT:
QUESTION;

There certainly is, Your Honor.

Well., why is it totally irrational for a

couple of Senators on opposite sides of fie argument to say,
"Well, we’ll split the difference and we will take it off one
and not the other"?
MR. SENNETT;

Because in the light of the compensation

system which is meant to replace the loss of wages to a family
the logic would be, as indicated previously in the opening
remarks, to increase disability benefits, because of the impact
of the loss of wages of a man -»
QUESTION;

But maybe in the negotiation between the

two they thought there are less dollars riding on death benefits
than there are on disability benefits and "Let's just make this
our trade-offo"
MR. SENNETT;

It might be well to speculate about

that, but along those lines keep in mind that the Longshore Act,
by extension, applies to employees in the District of Columbia,
Outer Continental Shelf employees, to a vast variety of employees,
many of whom .enjoy very substantial salaries, greatly in excess
of what had been contemplated for longshoremen.
I think the best way I can rebut this is to illustrate

34
what would happen if the position advanced by Mr. Ostmann ware
correct.

In other words, if Mr. Rasmussen had suffered a total

and permanent disability instantly upon h:Ls injury in a form that
was irreversible and left him entirely at the mercy of vagaries
of time and his family.

He would be enjoying $167 a week, plus

the additional increments that we have discussed.

So at the

present time, if he were still alive and itill with us, he
would be receiving $398 a week.
According to the proposition advanced by Mr. Ostmann,
immediately upon his demise, his family would enjoy $532 a
week.

• ,
VJe submit to this Court there Is no logic to that.
QUESTION:

Out of that $167 they would have to provide

all the care for him?
MR. SENNETT:
the reason for it.

That $167 would last -- And that Is

The reason for the increases on a yearly

basis provided by the Congress.
had in mind, Mr. Justice.

That is exactly what Congress

And that is that because of that

concern that that kind of money would not reflect the needs
of the family there were increases up to 200%, so that at the
present time that family would enjoy $398 a week.
QUESTION:

Is this where we get this concept of a

pronium on death?
MR. SENNETT:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that this,

perhaps, is an illustration of —

35
QUESTION:

In other words, the family with one fewer

person to support and no medical bills* gets almost three times
as much as the family which -still has the totally disabled
father, head of the household,,
MR. SENNETT:

It sounds like somewhat of a cynical

remark, but in the light of the fact that this is a compensation
system and not a damage system, I think that is the proper
characterization of the implications of what is being advanced
to the Court,
QUESTION:

It is on that basis that you and the

Solicitor General argue that that reading of the statute just
doesn't make any sense and Congress should not be considered to
have intended that?
MR. SENNETT:
signal to the Court.

We believe that Congress has given the
Now, the signal is perhaps a bit murky,

but the signal is there and when one examines the intent of the
system I think the answer is relatively straightforward and selfevident.
