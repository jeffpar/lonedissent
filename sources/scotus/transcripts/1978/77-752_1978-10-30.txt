MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

,We will hear arguments

next in No. 77-752* National Labor Relations Board against
the Catholic Bishop of Chicago.
Mr. McCree* you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP WADE H. MeC REE* EEQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE, PETITIONER
MR. McCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question whether application
of the National Labor Relations Act to Roman Catholic operated
secondary schools* where both secular and religious subjects
are taught* violates the Establishment Clause or the Free
Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.
Respondent suggests the additional question* whether
the National Labor Relations Act applies to private religious
schools at all.

Our reply brief* incorrectly and Inadvertently,

stated in Footnote 1 of page 2 that the employers did not
present this issue before the Court of Appeals.
partly in error.

We were

Respondent* the Catholic Bishop of Chicago*

did not present this argument* but the Respondent* Diocese of
Fort Wayne-South Bend* Incorporated* has a statement in its
brief that properly presented this issue to the court below.
We apologize and wish the record to show that that
issue is still before the Court.

4
However® as we show In our reply brief -QUESTION:
MRo McCRISE:

It wasn't dealt with by the court?
It was not® Your Honor.

That is our

understanding® sir.
QUESTION:

So® if we decided In your favor® on the

constitutional issue® it might be appropriate to remand that
to the Court of Appeals in a decision in the first instance.
MR» McCRdEi:

W@ believe that that issue is not a

substantial issue and® as we have endeavored to show in our
reply brief# the Congress# in amending the Act in 197^ to
eliminate the exemption in Section 2(2) for nonprofit hospi­
tals# expressly approved the Board's policy of asserting juris­
diction over private# nonprofit organizations.

We believe the

consistent legislative history shows no congressional inten­
tion to exempt nonprofit or religiously affiliated employers
from the scope of the Act.
In this -respect# the Court of Appeals correctly con­
cluded that the Act -- and I quote:

- "Clear on its face could

not be understood to preclude jurisdiction."
The facts may be briefly stated.

Respondent# the

Catholic Bishop of Chicago# a corporation sole# operates two
secondary schools for boys# Quigley North and Quigley South®
which we refer to as the Quigleys.

These schools offer a

secular curriculum in all respects indistinguishable from
the high school curriculum afforded by the public schools# but

5
in addition it also offers special religious training along
with its secular curriculum*
The admission requirements to the Quigleys are dif­
ferent from those of the public schools, however.

The

Quigleysj, Initially, admitted Catholic boys who were recom­
mended by their pastors as having expressed a desire to pursue
the priesthood*

Subsequently, other Catholic boys also recom­

mended by their pastors were allowed to matriculate, if their
pastor believed that they had a potential for the priesthood,
even though it had not been recognized or expressed*
The full-time teachers at the Quigleys have contracts
with the Respondent and the operating budgets of the Quigleys
come within the monetary jurisdictional standards that the
Board has established, $1 million in a given year and more
than $65,000 worth of goods in a given year bought directly
from out of state.
The Quigleys operate primarily, as the Board found,
as college preparatory schools.

They are fully accredited by

the state and by the North Central Accrediting Association.
They send, however, a majority of their students to secular
colleges.

As a matter of fact, in their 197^ graduating

class only 16^ went on to the Diocesan seminary college,
Niles College.
The other Respondent, the Diocese of Fort Wayne^outh Bend, Incorporated, operates five high schools in

6
fourteen counties in Northeast Indiana,

These schools, like

the Quigleys, offer a full program of college preparatory
high school subjects and also include religious subjects.
They differ from the Quigleys In this respect.

The South

Bend-Fort Wayne schools admit Catholic boys who have not
expressed a desire to pursue the priesthood or have the
potential for the priesthood, and they also admit some nonCatholic students.

The Bouth Bend-Fort Wayne schools also

satisfy the Board’s self-imposed monetary jurisdictional
standard.
The faculties of these schools are interesting.
The Quigleys employ a total of 76 full-time faculty persons,
of whom 46 are lay teachers.

So a clear majority of the

Quigleys’ faculty is a lay faculty.

The Fort Wayne-South Bend

Diocese in 1974 employed a total faculty of 207 teachers, 182
of which were lay teachers, and, of course, only 25 affiliated
with religious orders.
In September and October 1975* pursuant to separate
representation petitions filed by the Quigley Educational
Association and the Community Alliance for Teachers of Catholic
High Schools -- it has the felicitous acronym CATCH
were conducted in two units.

elections

Both Quigleys combined for a unit

and the Fort Wayne-South Bend schools, five schools as a unit.
The unit was composed of all lay faculty and the union won and
were duly certified

7
The employers refused to bargain and the Regional
Director Issued complaints charging violation of 8(a)(1) and
(5).

The employers admitted their refusal to bargain because,,

first* that their schools were completely religious* instead
of religiously affiliated* which is a dichotomy that the Board
has established to determina whether it will exercise its juris­
diction over private religious schools,
QUESTION:

Mr, Solicitor General* I take it* the

Board adheres to that dichotomy still?
MR,, McCREE:

The Board still adheres to that dichot­

omy,
QUESTION:

As a matter of its discretion* rather than

as a matter of its understanding of constitutional compulsion,
MR, McCREE:
Mr, Justice 'Stewart.

As a matter of its discretion*
It believes that it has jurisdiction to

consider all that come within -- that affect commerce -- but
it has preferred to follow this ~«
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

Do you support it* Mr, Solicitor?
Do I support it* Mr. Justice Brennan?

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

That was my next question* because I

gathered a lukewarmness in your brief,
MR, McCREE:

Nell* the Board is not required* as I

understand it* to exercise its full jurisdiction.

For a

number of years* the Board refrained from exercising

3
jurisdiction at all over private schools, not just religious
schools.
QUESTION:

Does this not involve the Board in a

determination of what is completely religious versus what is
merely religiously associated?

And if it does, doesn't that

get beyond the limit, constitutionally, of what —
MR. McCREE:

Mr» Justice Brennan, it might from the

phraseology employed, but that is not the way it has applied
this test.

It has applied -QUESTION:

Whether it is or not the way it has

applied it, it may involve the Board in examining into
religious principles that -MR, MeGREE:

It might, except the Board looked solely

to secular aspects of the schools in making this dichotomy.
For example, if the school is the functional equivalent of a
public school, if it offers a full secular course and then
has religious courses -QUESTION:

But that would not qualify the -- If it

did, that would not qualify the school, would it, for aid to
parochial schools?
MR, McCREE:
QUESTION:

No, that certainly would not.
And yet you say that distinction would be

enough to bring it within the Board's jurisdiction, notwith­
standing the examination of -<=
MR., McCREE:

No, they suggest that the Board has

9
statutory jurisdiction to consider -QUESTION:

I don’t understand why at least the

Solicitor General doesn’t take the position that even completely
religious schools would be subject to the Board's jurisdiction.
MR, McCREE:

It is our position that the Board has

jurisdiction over completely religious schools.
QUESTION;

Then why defend this dichotomy?

QUESTION:

This dichotomy is not an issue here.

MR. McCREE:

I don’t feel X have to defend the

dichotomy ~ QUESTION:

That’s not an issue in this case, Is it?

MR. McCREE: — except to suggest that I think the
Board has jurisdiction to -- has the discretion to decide
whether it will exercise its jurisdiction.

But we contend that

it has jurisdiction over both.
QUESTION:

Do you not agree that this dichotomy

sheds some light upon the problem of whether there is an inter­
ference or an impact on religion?
MR. McCREE:

That is not the reason the Board has

adopted it, because —
QUESTION:

Perhaps not, but my question is:

Would

you agree that it sheds some light on the problem?
MR. McCREE:

I think probably not.

The Board is

looking to see whether — what is its impact on commerce.

And

it has determined ’-•hat the completely religious schools, which

10

have been schools in Its experience that afforded after school
religious instruction#and were not the functional equivalent
of the public schools, didn 6t have the requisite impact.
QUESTION:

By the "completely religious" do you mean

the seminary that trains priests, among other things?
MR. McGREE:
fashion.

They have not applied It in that

They have applied it -- If the seminary that trains

priests is the functional equivalent of the regular high
school -QUESTION:

Or grade school,

MR, McGREE: -- or grade schools they have applied It.
They have refrained from doing so only with the after school,
strictly religious,, program,
QUESTION:

Has it not been a tenet of the Catholic

Faith and of some other faiths that operate schools that If
the children are inculcated with the principles of the faith
and of religion and morals in the first dozen years of their
lives then they are adherents to that faith?
MR, McGREE:
QUESTION:

I have heard that expressed.
Doesn't that permeate the literature on

the subject?
MR. McCREE:
QUESTION:

I believe it does, Mr. Chief Justice.
The contrary of that is some of the anti-

religious countries, Communist, for example, who make it a
felony to teach religion to a child under 12 or under 15.

11

There Is some relationship there, is there not?
MR, MeGREE:

There is, but fortunately we do not

think that is involved here in this case,

We think that what

we have here is a question whether the exercise of its statu­
tory authority over these schools that are, in fact, the
functional equivalent of high schools but also teach religious
subjects, is forbidden because of conflict either with the
Establishment Clause or the Equal Protections Clause,
QUESTION:

General McCree, you apparently feel that

the statutory issue is clear simply because of the general
language, and yet an exception was found In McCulloch v.
Soeiedad, where the general language was equally clear,
MR, McCREE:

Well, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, we concede

that the general language was equally clear, but the McCulloch
case, If memory serves. Is a case involving seamen on foreign
vessels, whether they would be within the Jurisdiction of the
Labor Board,

And there it was felt because of the inter­

national aspects -- or because of the possible international
repercussions of asserting jurisdiction over foreign seamen,
over foreign flag vessels, would require an expressed state­
ment of Congress' intention to bring them under this rule,
QUESTION:

But isn't it just as permissible an

inference, in the light of the reasoning in McCulloch, to say
that assertion of Congressional jurisdiction over a parochial
school and the Bishop of Chicago, would require an express

12

statement because of a possible First Amendment implication?
MR„ McCREE:

We submit that it is not because other

regulatory measures have been held applicable to religiously
affiliated schools* fire regulations* attendance laws* health
and safety provisions.
QUESTION:

But none of those affect the kind of

teaching* do they* that goes on?
MR, McCREE:
QUESTION:

Nor does -They are all neutral* are they not?

MRo MeCREE:

-- Nor does the order in question here

affect the kind of teaching.

It should be borne in mind that

the only order here is an order to bargain about rates of pay*
V'

,
‘

<»

wages* conditions of employment* and if an agreement is reached*
to embody it in an order.

They are not told what to teach* but

merely to bargain on the items that I have just referred to.
QUESTION:

From that* I take it*it is your position

that the bargaining process* the total bargaining process*
would have no impact whatever on methods of teaching or -~
MR. McCRSE:

We submit it would have no impact at

all on methods of teaching or content of teaching* if limited
to these aspects that I have mentioned* wages* hours* con­
ditions of employment.
QUESTION:

Would you suggest that that is true of

the public schools* that the process has not had any impact on
how teaching has been conducted* even though there it is

13

limited to wages,, hours and working conditions?
MR. McCREE:

I am not aware that any curriculum

content or pedagogical techniques have been made mandatory
subjects of bargaining in the public schools.
QUESTION:
MR. McCRES:

Neither directly nor indirectly?
Well* there may be sane indirect impact*

but that's not before us today.

In 1936* this Court considered

the case of the Associated Press v. National Labor Relations
Board* and there it was suggested that there might ccme a time
when the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech might
be implicated if the Labor Board took cognizance or extended
its jurisdiction over employees of newspapers., or in this
case the Associated Press* which is a coalition of than.

And

this Court stated then that it would not decide hypothetical
situations that might not ever be presented to it for its
decision.

And it is interesting that in the 42 years since

Associated Press was decided this Court has never had to de­
cide whether affording recognition to the rights of journalists
to collectively bargain has

ever implicated a First Amendment

violation.
We suggest that this is what we have here.

And we

suggest that the Court of Appeals was in error when it decided*
based upon these hypothetical problems*that this would be*
somehow* a violation of both the Establishment Clause and the
Equal Protection Clause.

We think the Court of Appeals was

14

in error .in blurring the distinction between these two clauses
We think this case presents primarily a question

under the

Free Exercise Claus® and that it does not constitute an
establishment of religion* but if anything at all* as I would
suggest* a violation of the Free Exercise Clause.
QUESTION:
MR. MeC.REE:

In the sense of a burden on free exercise
If the Court please* yes.

And* there* of course
QUESTION:

What kind of a burden* Mr. Solicitor

Genera 1?
MR. McCREE:

Well* the Court of Appeals below sug­

gested that somehow it would inhibit the exercise of freedom
of religion.

And we suggest* in this respect* that the Free

Exercise Clause is absolute* insofar as it applies to belief*
and that it is clear that the Congress cannot legislate to
control a person’s belief.

But it is not absolute insofar as

It impinges upon conduct believed to be mandated by or con­
sistent with belief.

And this is the distinction that this

Court has made.
Bo* we suggest that the threshold question when one
approaches a claim of violation of the Free Exercise Clause
is* first* whether the conduct complained of is* indeed* man­
dated or directed by religious belief.
^QUESTION:

Now* that leads me to ask you* Mr. Solid

tor General* about the hypothetical case -- and* according to

15

one of the amicus briefs here# Ife Is not a hypothetical ease,
it might be a real case -- of a religious group whose religious
tenets taught that the organization of labor unions was wrong»
I am talking about the Seventh Day Adventists brief.

That’s

what it says, as I understand it.
MR8 MeCREE:

I understand it to say that, too, but

I suggest here that to bargain collectively with labor unions
is not inconsistent with the religious beliefs of these
Respondents, and they don’t say so either.
QUjSsTIQN:

What if it were?

What if this were a

Seventh Day Adventists school?
MR. McCREE:
then6

Well, we would have a different problem

We would have a problem such as this Court confronted

in Yoder, where the Amish children were -QUESTION:

Just didn’t believe in education beyond

the elementary level.
MR. McCREE:

— didn't believe in education beyond

the ninth grade or the eighth grade.

And that was clearly a

religious belief of theirs and this Court determined that it
was possible to allow this free exercise, because there was
no showing of an overriding governmental Interest.

But it

did engage in a balancing test.
But here, we suggest that this isn't the Seventh
Day Adventist appeal or case, this is a case involving the
Catholic parochial schools.

We suggest that the Catholic

16

position* as far as labor unions is concerned* is one of
support.

We would refer the Court to an encyclical of Pope

Leo XIII* Rerum Novarium* which recognized the right of
employees to organize and bargain collectively* and more
recently Mater et Magistra* which is an encyclical of Pope
John XXIII* X believe in 1961* which also took the same
position o
QUESTION:

In any event* despite those encyclicals

that you or I might read to say that* and perhaps they do*
we know in this case that these Respondents say that to be
ordered to bargain with the unions would violate their rights
under the First Amendment* whatever those encyclicals might
say,
MRe McCREE:

We understand them not to say that to

have to bargain does that.

They are supposing consequences

subsequent to the
QUESTION:

Which they say would inevitably follow

if there was imposed upon them a duty to bargain with these
labor unions,
MR, McCREE:

But this is the same approach* the same

argument that was made in Associated Press that was decided in
1936,

This Court said* "We will decide that when it becomes

necessary,"

And it is interesting* as I indicated* It has

not become necessary in this other First Amendment area,
QUESTION:

Would you concede that there is perhaps

17

some difference between the free pres© free expression* on the
one hand# and the two religion clauses on the other?
MR. McCREE;

I certainly would* and I finely as this

Court has founds it difficult at times to reconcile the
Establishment Clause with the Free Exercise Clause»
QUESTION:

We have said in some opinions that there

is a tension between the two,
MR» McCREE:

In Walz* I believe* this Court said

that there has to be some giving in the joints where they
come, together.

And* as a matter of fact* the Free Exercise

Clause* philosophically* creates some problems under the
Establishment Clause* because it allows a person who professes
religion as motivating his behavior to present arguments that
a person who does not profess religion to present.

And in that

respect it impinges somewhat on the Establishment Clause.
That's what makes these cases extraordinarily difficult.
We believe what this case demonstrates is that with
these Respondents the order* which is merely an order to bargain
with a duly elected representative* does not contravene any
religious belief that is asserted.

And* therefore* under the

Free Exercise Clause* we don't have to pursue it any further.
QUESTION:

General McCree* may I ask a factual

question that perhaps you know?
Is the bargaining unit* say* in the Quigleys where
there are 30 religious members of the faculty and 46 lay

18

members, are any of the religious persons members of the
bargaining unit?
MR. MeCREE:

They are not.

The definition of the

unit that was made consisted just of the lay teachers., none
of the members of a religious order.
QUESTION:

Would it be an unfair labor practice for

the Bishop to prefer in hiring and discharge, and the like,
clerics over lay persons?
MR» MeCREE:

That's a difficult question to answer.

I would think probably not, unless it had an anti-union animus.
I would think it would be appropriately within his power to
prefer to have a member of a religious order added to the
faculty for a specific purpose in preference to a lay person,
who might not even be a member of his faith.

But if it was

done for anti-labor reasons, with anti-labor animus, then it
might be an unfair labor practice.
QUESTION:

Would it be the same if the hiring

authority preferred members of the faith over members of other
faiths or persons who had none?
MR. MeCREE:

My answer would be the same, Mr. Chief

Justice, because there you would focus whether there was an
anti-union animus.

If I may

just answer it a little further.

There is a case that we cite that has arisen in which It was
asserted that the principal of the school read a particular
Scripture passage that contained a threat against union

19
activity, and the Board heard that and decided in favor of the
bishop who was the employer in this case, finding that it did
not, which didn’t require it to do anything except determine
whether this attitude was threatening and which, again, is a
secular reference,
QUESTION:

What do we do with a situation where an

individual is discharged for two reasons, one, heresy, and the
other, in the eyes of the employer, over-aggressive unionism?
MR, McCREE:

I think in that case the Board would

have & problem that Is not dissimilar from problems that it
entertains every day, when an employee is discharged for being
a poor worker, but for being a union activist.

There the

Board makes a determination what was the real reason.

And if

it is satisfied that the real reason was one prohibited by
the Act, then it will hold for the employee* otherwise it will
uphold the employer.
QUESTION:

Would the Board be bound by the bishop's

determination as to the issue of heresy in Mr, Justice
Blackmun's question?
MR. McCREE:

I would think so,

I would think the

Board could not look into whether the alleged conduct was,
in fact, heretical.

I think this Court has made it very clear

that we are not to look into the validity of religious doctrine,
QUESTION:

What if a teacher, a lay teacher, assume

either a member of the same faith or not, assigned the reading

20

of books which were condemned by the hiring authority,,

These

books are not on the reading list and the teacher said* "Yes*
they are,"

Who is going to ultimately decide the content of

that course?
MR* MeCREE:

I suppose a reference to the reading

list would be a secular reference.
QUESTION:

If there was* in fact —

I am assuming that it was declared by

the authority of the Church that it impinged on the faith.
MR. MeCREE:

I would think if a teacher went beyond

— even a lay teacher — went beyond a prescribed reading list*
this would give a ground for disciplinary action that wouldn't
at all constitute an unfair labor practice.

A teacher hasn't

a right to use his own or her own judgment about what should
be taught.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that bargaining agents

have never both suggested and supported the power of a teacher
in a public school to do just that?
MR. MeCREE:
QUESTION:

I am certain they have and they will.
And maintained it with strikes and threats

of strikes* have they not?
•i

MR. MeCREE:

I wouldn’t be surprised If they had and

do* but we are suggesting what should the law be on the subject.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General* this case only

involves lay members* and the only problems involved are
working conditions?

21

MRo McCREE:

This is what we endeavor to say*

Mr0 Justice Marshall»
If I might just conclude by suggesting that when a
religiously affiliated organization chooses to enter Into an
enterprise that affects commerce* it must accept the same
obligations to respect laws enacted for the protection of
societal interests that are Imposed on similar enterprises
not having a religious organization»
QUESTION;

Could that not also be true of the

operations of a church* itself?

Does not every church purchase

something that is moving in Interstate commerce?

And the

pastors are moved from one place to another in some faiths»
Isn’t that possible that that would ~~ the church* itself —
MR» McCREE;

If the church functions as an employer*

it would present a very difficult question.

I suppose if a

church ran a business* an Industrial business* I am not at
all aware that that business would be exempt from the thrust
of the National Labor Relations Act.

Just because of its

religious nature it couldn’t deny its employees the benefits
that the Congress has decided —
QUESTION:

A book publishing company might be an

example»
MR» McCREE;

It might very well be and I would have

no difficulty with that.
QUESTION:

General McCree, doesn't every church

22

function as an employer in a sense* and if they hire a
pastor »MR9 McCREE:
QUESTION:

A church might —
They would have a hard time getting along

without one»
MR. McCREE:

I don't know»

I am advised* if the

Court please* that there are religions that have no clergy
whatsoever and that any person is eligible.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

They are all clergy.
They are all clergy.

We used to

encounter that during the war.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Reuben.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PON REUBEN* ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. REUBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
We rely not only upon a violation of the Free
Exercise Clause* but believe that this case is also governed
by the entangle of principles that were enunciated in Lemon
and Meek.
The schools that are before this Court are the same
schools that have numerous times been described by opinions of
this Court as schools that are created to perpetuate the faith
and to propagate the faith.

These are the typical parochial

23

schools where fche mission is fco bring religion to the children.
If there is a difference here, the Quigley Seminary is designed
and created fco bring people, young men, into fche priesthood*
which we describe in our brief as "fche lifeblood of fche Church."
Without priests, the Catholic Church could not prevail or con­
tinue.
Now, because of fche religious mission involved
and fche Court has noted this in many of its cases -» fche
bishop has complete and absolute authority over what is
taughfc in the schools.

The bishop is the arbiter of what is

taught in fche schools, subject only to the usual state regu­
lations in order to allow —
QUESTION:
MR. REUBEN:

He is subject fco fche state regulations?
Only the neutral state regulations of
\

compulsory attendance and minimum subjects that are necessary
fco obtain accreditation.

But if the bishop wants, for example,

in a mathematics class fco have religion taughfc, as examples
have been given In fche Court’s opinions, he may do so.

He Is

fche supreme authority of whafe —
QUESTION:

And fche state can also take away fche

accreditation —
MR. REUBEN:
QUESTION:
MR. REUBEN:
QUESTION:

Yes, they can —
And then fche school cannot operate.
Oh, fche school may operate.
Without accreditation?

24

MR, REUBEN:
QUESTION:

That's correct,
Do you have a compulsory attendance law

in Illinois?
MR, REUBEN:
QUESTION:

We do, but —
Would your clients be subject to that

law?
MR, REUBEN:

They would* indeed * except that* Your

Honor* in Yoder* Your Honors decided that after eighth grade
the State’s interest in compulsory attendance was not as great
as the religious principles involved,
And so, I think* if you look at all of the parochiaid
cases that have been decided up here,» in each instance what
has been noted is that the lay teacher is subject to the
authority and to the jurisdiction and to the command of the
bishop.
Now* the NLRB Act* I submit to the Court* Is the
antithesis of what is the religious belief that the religious
school should be composed of* because the stated purpose of the
NLRB Act is to have a greater parity between the employer and
the employee.
of the Act,

That’s the initial statement in the purposes
It is because of the inequality of bargaining

power between the employees and their employers that the Act
was created.
On its face* the NLRB incursion into the religious
schools is just an absolute collision of the First Amendment.

25
For example., the Board has the power to conduct
elections and then to require bargainings and bargaining in
good faiths which means give and take.

We do not believe that this type of power can square
with the deep-rooted religious conviction that the bishop is

We are talking about bargaining over teaching»
QUESTION:

What about minimum wage regulations*

the Pair Labor Standards Act?
MR. REUBEN:

Well* Your Honors held -- the Court

has held in the Usury case that the states have that power
reserved»

I do not believe that the minimum wage problem Is

the same problem,, because you do not have* a© you have In the
typical bargaining history of collective bargaining with
teachers* the dialogue that starts with wages and ends up with
curriculum* textbooks* and what have you»
QUESTION:

But don’t you have the problem that some

of the Catholic schools pay a lesser wage scale* I suppose* for
lay teachers* who are* perhaps* dedicated persons* willing to
donate their services* something like that?

And raising the

wage level might deny them the opportunity to get the faculty
they need.
MR» REUBEN:

That's correct»

Pushed to It* I would

say that the Minimum Wage Law should not apply to the lay
school teacher in the religious school.
QUESTION:

How about the janitors and the people

who run the building?
MR. REUBEN:

I have no problem and think the janitors

have every right to have the NLRB Intrude.

That does not

involve bargaining over teaching.
QUESTION:

You mean the bishop doesn't have anything

27
to do with labor?
MR* REUBEN:

I didn’t hear you, Your Honor.
You mean the bishop doesn’t have any

jurisdiction over the laborer?
bishop was the boss.
MR. REUBEN:

Your whole point was that the

Isn't that your whole point?
No, sir.

I am saying the bishop is the

supreme arbiter when it comes to the teaching function.

The

bishop is the boss of the janitor, Your Honor, but the janitor
does not involve himself in the teaching function.
QUESTION:

I know that, but why is he subject to the

NLRB and the teacher is not?
MR. REUBEN:

Because, in connection with the janitor,

you do not have an incursion onto religious beliefs.

You will

not have, as I perceive it, an unfair labor practice challeng­
ing the bishop as to whether or not his discharge was caused for
religious grounds or because of an anti-union animus.

With

a janitor, you will not have an unfair labor practice over the
composition of the faculty.
QUESTION:

I would agree with you, if you could —

and I know you can’t — name me one non-Catholic janitor in a
Chicago Catholic school.

I don’t think we need to get the

janitors in here.
QUESTION:
MR. REUBEN:

They hire non-Catholic attorneys, I think.
I think that is a perfect answer to the

question, and I’ll stop when I am ahead.

If you want to put attorneys and janitors

If the bishop elected to increase had he had the

opportunity to do so, that’s something that would have to be
bargained.

workload,

of things — and look at what happens.

It is vary clear that the

necessary consequence of this is first, that the bishop is chilled
He will try to avoid the zone of regulation if he can.
Second, I suggest to you the kind of inquiries that

tanglement than the kind of activity that was condemned in

We don’t have- to have a parade

We have fine examples of what will

The Solicitor General referred to one where the

Bishop of Gary was cited for an unfair labor practice because
of a prayer that he gave, citing from the Scriptures.

He

ultimately was sustained by the NLRB, but it took 531 pages
of proceedings to do so

29

The Biehop of Port Wayne was cited for an unfair
labor practice because he disapproved of a teacher teaching
Johnson and Masters in the classroom»

He also was cited for

an unfair labor practice because he wanted to terminate an
employee who had married a divorced Catholic.

He also was

cited for an unfair labor practice because of an argument
between a lay teacher and the bishop over religious instruction
and how it will be given.

What Is the interest that is being served to bring
on this pandora's boxs this parade of horribles?

Ninety-

seven percent of the teachers in the United States* by law*
are not allowed to have the NLRB or collective bargaining.
They are public school teachers,,
The commerce involved in connection with parochial
schools and seminaries is very limited * and Indeed it is inter­
twined with subsidies,

I wonder if some day we won't see

bargaining between the bishop and the faculty of the school*
if the Government's position is sustained here* as to the
amount of subsidy that the bishop should put forth.
Both of these schools have to be subsidized,
Quigley* I think* it is $600*000 a year and it is $750*000 in
Port Wayne.
The schools before Your Honors do have a grievance
procedure* in both Instances* so that the teachers are not
left helpless or just at the whim of the bishop,

Purthennore*

there is a very* very important governing factor here on all
of these schools* and it is called the market place.

When

these schools come and compete for lay teachers* they are
competing with the public schools.
And that's why I answered* Mr. Justice Stevens* your
question concerning minimum wage an hour.

They are competing

31
— they are a 3$ employer competing with a

97$

employer and if

they do not do right and proper by their teachers they will
not employ them and they will not have teachers to staff their
schools,
QUESTION;

i suppose that can be said.» too* of the

private secular school* can't it?
MR, REUBEN:

That's correct.

The difference is

that in the private sector you do not have the First Amendment
consideration.

So* it is an entirely different question.

You

do not have -»
QUESTION:

You were talking about competition and I

merely am saying that the private school has the competition
angle to bargain,
MR, REUBEN:

I concede that.

In the parochia id eases* the Court has made a point
of the political strife that can occur* the dialogue that will
occur in a legislature every time an annual appropriation is
requested,

It is perfectly obvious from what lias occurred

here since '7^* when the Board took jurisdiction* that there
will be constant litigation over the bishop's authority* be­
cause now he must share it with the NLRB and the union,

I can

foresee efforts in the Congress to undo what the NLRB might do,,
And I am sure that if one went into the precincts of Brooklyn
they would discover that raw emotion and great religious
dialogue and bitterness has occurred because of what happened

in the Brooklyn school.
QUESTION:

Why is there constant litigation over the

NLRB's assumption of jurisdiction here* when there isn't over*

In Illinois* must the Catholic

MRo REUBEN:

What if they did?

MR. REUBEN:

Well» I think that I would have no

trouble with that» because that would be» in effect» a
licensing before the person began to teach.

However» If you

go back into the history of parochial schools» when the
parochial schools were 88$ staffed by nuns and priests and
brothers» 1 suspect there was no certification0

And so long

as the end product resulted in an acceptable primary or
secondary education, the result was acceptable and the
certification authority was satisfied.
QUESTION:

Mr. Reuben, isn't it true that in most

large cities they don't ride herd on the parochial schools?
They have been running for years and they just let them go.
T don't think it matters in this case at all, but isn't that
true?
MR. REUBEN:

I wish it were so.

The parochial

school must comply with all of the fire regulations, all of
the certification regulations and there is a great policing
authority -QUESTION:

I know they do, but, I mean, does the

fire commissioner walk in there?
MR. REUBEN:

There are fire Inspections and there

36
Is an even greater policing authority.

It is called parents.

They will react very quickly if their children are not being
educated properly.
QUESTION:

Where does the parent go?

He goes to

the bishop.
MR. REUBEN:

That is correct.

Now* in the last analysis* I'd like to conclude by
suggesting to Your Honors that the Court in the Seventh
Circuit properly described the situation of these parties
here as in a no-win situation.

In this case* we are religious

associated and the Government would have the NLRB being able
to come into the school and cause bargaining that would
necessarily raise the cost.

Costs of parochial school

education* as the Court knows* has gone up over teho years*
so that the states have strived very* very hard to find ways
to get money to the parochial schools.

And the Court has

found that this* in most instances* is impermissible en­
tanglement.

And now to have these same schools be treated as

secular and not eligible for money but eligible for regulation*
not only to me strikes at the core of the First Amendment*
but offends at least ray notions of fundamental fairness.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

One question before you sit down.

I suppose when the state withdraws* if it did
withdraw* the certification of an Amish school or a Lutheran
r

37
school or a Catholic school., because they are spending the
arithmetic time on religion* it isn't because they are
teaching -religion* but because they are not teaching mathe­
matics?
MB, REUBEN:
concern is secular.

That's correct.

The state's only

The state does not entangle Itself by

that kind of inquiry.
