MR, CHX&F JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

in 78-488# United States against 564,54 Acres of Land# etcetera.
Mr, Barnettj you may proceed»
ORA it ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R, BARNETT, £t>Q.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, BARNETT:

Mr, Chief Justice# and may it please the

Court:
The question in this case is whether# when the Govern­
ment condemns facilities that are operated on a not-for-profit
basis# like a church or another private entity# the measure of
just compensation that the Fifth Amendment requires is the fair
market value of the facilities taken# or whether# on the other
hand# it is the cost of constructing substitute facilities.
The Respondent Southeastern Pennsylvania Synod of the
Lutheran Church in America owns three separate parcels of land
totaling about 300 acres onr.theEDelaware River, in Northeastern
Pennsylvania# which it used as three summer camps for young
people,
■ QUESTION:

What's happened to the original 564?

MR, BARNETT:

The 564 acres# Mr, Justice Blackmun# in­

cluded a number of tracts besides the three owned by the Synod,
At the beginning of the Appendix# you will find the Declarations
of Taking applicable to all the tracts# and the Synod's tracts
are three of them

4
In June of 1970* the United States condemned these
three parcels for a river project»

Six years before* in 1964*

anticipating that the land would be condemned* Respondent had
purchased some 3s800 acres of land in the nearby Pocono's* as
a replacement site for its camps.
When the land on the river was taken* the Government
offered to pay $433*000 as the fair market value of the camps
taken.

Respondent* however* rejected the offer* claiming that

the cost of developing equivalent camps at the new site would be
something in excess of $5 million.
Respondent* accordingly* asked the court to rule that
the appropriate standard was the cost of constructing the new
facilities* not the fair market value of the old facilities*
The district Court ruled against that contention and
Respondent took an interlocutory appeal and the Third Circuit
ruled that the substitute facilities measure of compensation is
available to private owners of non-profit community facilities
in certain cases* as well as to public owners — that is*
governmental entities

as had bean-recognized 'previously to

be available*
QUESTION:

Am I right* General Barnett* in thinking

that this Court has never even applied that doctrine to public?
MR, BARNETT:

That is true.

This Court has never en­

dorsed the substitute facilities doctrine* even for public en­
tities.

The Brown case* which is cited in the briefs* was a case

5
Ln which Congress, after one town was flooded by a public project,
appropriated money to condemn another area as a substitute site,
and the question was the constitutional validity of that subsequen taking, whether that was a public use under the Fifth
-Amendment,
The Court held that it was and the Court’s language
talked about how it is a reasonable thing to substitute a new
town for the old town»

But the question was not the scope of

compensation for a taking.
&o, this Court has never approved the substitute
facilities doctrine.
In any event, the Third Circuit here, in its first
opinion, said that the doctrine can be applicable to a private,
non-prdflt entity, in certain circumstances.

It described the

key circumstance as one in which the facilities taken are
reasonably necessary to public welfare.
On remand, the trial was divided into two phases.

The

issue in the first phase was whether the substitute facilities
measure of compensation applied to the taking of these camps.
After a 10-day trial, the jury returned a verdict, by special
interrogatory, finding that the doctrine did not apply here.
The second phase of the trial was devoted to the issue
of the fair market value of the condemned camps,.

Respondents

sought to establish the fair market value by what is called the
'cost approach," that is, the. reproduction cost of the camps

6
minus depreciation — that is, the reproduction cost of the
buildings, minus the depreciation on the buildings, plus the
value of the underlying land.
if/1

■'

'

The Government used two evidentiary approaches to show
the fair market value.

One was, again, the cost approach, and

the other was the so-called "market data approach," that is
comparable sales.
The jury returned a verdict

an award of $740,000 as

the fair market value of the camps, which was a compromise be­
tween the position taken by the opposing side, which of course
often happens in these cases.
Respondent then took a second appeal and the Court of
Appeals reversed again.

In addition to finding error in comments

to the jury in closing, the court held that the District Court’s
instructions on application of the substitute facilities measure
of compensation had been erroneous.
As the Court of Appeals restated the doctrine, it has
three requirements.

The property must be operated on a not-for-

profit basis, there must be no ready market for the particular
type of property and the facilities must be reasonably necessary
to the public welfare.

That is -- I should have made clear --

the Court of Appeals’ restatement of what it held the first time.
The Court of Appeals then went on to elucidate further what it
meant, and with respect to the no ready market test, for example,
the court held that even if Respondent could have sold its camps

7
and even if they had a fair market value* as the jury had found
that they did* this condition of the substitute facilities test
A/as met if Respondent could not have replaced the camps in the
market place for a cost roughly equal to their fair market value,
With respect to the third condition that the facility
be reasonably necessary to the public- welfare* the majority exalained that what it meant by this was not really necessity* but
simply that the condemned facility must* quote* "provide a bene­
fit to the community that will not be as fully provided after the
facility is taken."
Thus* the court gave as an example if the camps here
did* as Respondent contended* help to reduce juvenile crime by
baking some youngsters from inner-city Philadelphia and* thus*
nelping to alleviate the gang problem in inner-city Philadelphia*
then the court said* "These camps would provide a benefit to the
entire community of Eastern Pennsylvania not just to the campers.
Judge idtern concurred in the opinion* under compulsion
of the court's earlier opinion* but his opinion is essentially
a dissent on the merits.

Judge Rosen dissented* but from the

court's reinterpretation of the earlier opinion„
The Court of Appeals remanded the case for a new trial
pursuant to its newly articulated standards* and at that point
this Court intervened by granting certiorari.
Well* the substitute facilities doctrine with which
we deal here and which* as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has pointed out*

8
this Court has never approved, is in any event an exception to
what this Court has made clear is the standard method of com­
puting just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.

And that

method, of course, is fair market value.
The Court has defined'just compensation" as the full
monetary equivalent of the property taken, in the Reynolds case,
and, as stated in Almota, the Court early established the concept
of market value.

The owner is entitled to the fair market value

of his property at the time of taking.
Now, the Court has also made clear that where the
property is so special that market data, such as comparable sales,
may be few, resort must be had to other data to ascertain its
value.

This is the Miller case.

And those other approaches are,

for one, the income approach, capitalization of net income, which
can be used for business properties, or the cost approach, re­
production coast minus depreciation, which, in fact, was used
here in the fair market value aspect of the trial,
QUESTION:

It wouldn't be very helpful to use a

capitalization approach on a boys * camp, would it?
MR, BARNETT:

No, it would not be, and nobody has

suggested that that approach be used here, Mr, Chief Justice.
But the Court has indicated that these approaches,
quote, "may have relevance but only, of course, as bearing on
what a prospective purchaser would have paid."

They are all

approaches that are designed to determine fair market value.

9
Now. the difference with fche substantive facilities
doctrine is that it concededly is not a method of determining
values at all.

It is -- Or at least certainly not fair market

value — It is a completely different avenue.
As Respondent here says in his brief at page 23, "The
doctrine is not used in conjunction with the market value ap­
proach to valuation, but as an alternative to it."

And, thus,

the difference which is Indicated by the facts of this case,
where the fair market value was found to be $740,000, and jet
Respondent claims that the cost of substitute facilities would
be $4 or $5 million.
Now, Respondent has attempted to justify the use of
fche substitute facilities doctrine here, on fche basis that this
case is unique, or at least very, very special, that it is a
situation that arises infrequently,

a

f

,v

Whafc is rare about it?
Well, Respondent says that this is a case in which
the property's chief value is in its use and not its status-’in
fche market place.

And this theme that the true value of this

property is in its use, and that that makes this case very rare
and different, recurs throughout Respondent's brief.
In the first place, we are not sure what this means,
that the true value is in its use.

It may mean simply that the

property is adapted Tor a particular use, in this case camps,
and that makes it particularly valuable.

If that is all it means.

10

we have no quarrel with it whatever.

It is what this Court has

said* for example* in the Mitchell case.

But if it means more

than that* we see nothing so rare about this case and no justi­
fication here for deviating from the principles of fair market
value that this Court has laid down»

If it simply means that

there is a disparity here* as Respondent emphasizes* between what
the property-owner would receive by way of fair market value and
what the property owner needs in order to preserve the use to
which the property was devoted; well* that happens very commonly.
It often happens that a property may suffice for Its
owner's use* even be uniquely well adapted for that use* and yet
when it's condemned the fair market value falls short of what the
owner would have to pay to acquire a property equally suitable
for carrying on that use.
It may happen* for example* in the case of an old
factory*

specially adapted to the owner's use.

For example*

in the Certain Property in Manhattan case* 306 F . 2d 439* one
of the issues involved the printing plant of a newspaper* EL
PROGRESSO in Manhattan* which was an old printing plant but very

•well adapted to putting out this particular newspaper.

However*

the evidence was that if anybody bought the property they would
tear the building down and use it for something else.
the

That is*

fair market value of the structure* as a printing plant*

was nil.

And the court held that there would be no compensation

for that structure.

That is one example.

11

Another example would be an old and ramshackle house,»
very comodious for the family living in it, but if the house were
condemned, its age -- and I suppose we are not talking about a
house in Washington, G.C., but elsewhere -- might bring it a
reduced price on the market, which would not suffice to buy a
new house or any house of equal size and convenience.
QUESTION:

I suppose, Mr, Barnett, that you take the

same position with regard to an old church, too.

.Say this had

been a church instead of a camp.
MRo BARNETT:

Well, yes, that would be true.

Similarly,

with an old church, the fair market value might be insufficient
to purchase a new church equally suitable to the needs of the
congregation.

On the other hand, it might not be the case.

The

reproduction cost of the old church, if it is not a worn down old
church, but a well-preserved old church, the reproduction cost
conceivably could be higher than the cost of building a new
w

plastic church.
QUESTION:

Well, that was. the case, too, in Cora,

wasn't it, where the ships condemned had risen in value and it
was perfectly clear that the court said the just compensation
award need not be sufficient to enable the owner to buy ships
at an inflated value because the inflated value had been created
by the Government.
MR0 BARNETT:

Indeed, this follows almost necessarily

from the considerations of depreciation and new regulatory

12

requirements.

The old building is going to have depreciated

and it is going to follow almost necessarily that a new building
will cost more,

Also if there are new regulatory requirements -

QUESTION:

Yes* but as I understand their test* it is

the substitution cost, less depreciation.
MR. BARNETT:

They would allow for

We are not sure they would do that at

all., Mr. Justice Stevens.

They have said in their brief that

if there are what they call maintenance and capital savings on
the new camp, they should be deducted from the award.

We are

not sure what they mean by maintenance and capital savings.

If

they meant depreciation costs., one would have thought they would
say so.

But that certainly was not their position below.
In the trial court, as we explained in our reply

brief* they argued precisely for the entire cost of constructing
these camps* as testified to by their experts* without any depredation.
QUESTION:

But you would still object to the alterna»

tive approach* even if they did allow a factor for depreciation
or betterment* as the insurance company -MR, BARNETT:

Yes* we still would object to it.

But it is noteworthy that the substitute facilities
doctrine* .as applied to public entities* more often than not has
been applied without the deduction for depreciation. And the
trial court here so ruled.

At page 650 of the transcript* the

court* after stating* "The synod argues that depreciation cannot

13

be considered in a substitute facilities evaluations,'' at page 627
the court went on to rule at page 650* "I think that the depreci­
ation is not a proper deduction for taking the public property*
and therefore it should not be permitted when it is private."
And* indeed* if the purpose of the substitute facili­
ties doctrine is to allow substitution replacement of the facili­
ty* it is certainly arguable that that purpose is frustrated.
QUESTION:

Well* your ultimate purpose is to provide

just compensation* as required by the Constitution.

And one

could say that means you have to have full compensation in
order to replace it* but you are not entitled to a profit on
the transaction.
MR. BARNETT:

One certainly could say that.

We would

say that you are entitled only to the fair market value of what
you have* and you are not entitled to replacement at all.

One

reason for that is the tremendous -- and a point* I believe* that
has not really been emphasized so far in this case -- tremendous
flexibility and leeway that comes in by way of the substitute
facilities doctrine.

It is supposed to be a functionally equi­

valent substitute facility.

Ar.d this case well illustrates how
i

much flexibility can come in there.

For example* here Respondent

had 300 acres of flat land along the river where hie camps were
i

located and went out and bought 3300 acres of wooded hilly land
on which the only water was a creek.

Thus* in order to have

functionally equivalent aquatic facilities* it is necessary to

14

3am the creek to create a small lake* for which Respondent would
have $1 to build the dam,
In on the small lake.
over the new lake.

Respondent wants three beaches to put

Respondent has to build a bridge to get

The old camp was on a public road.

Respondent

has to build a new access road of 1,6 miles to get to the new
camp* plus substantial interior road facilities.
The trial court charged that this was all all rights
so long as the jury found that the new camp was adequate* that
the new site was adequate to Respondent's needs.

The costs

resulting from new conditions at the site should be taken into
account in computing the cost of substitute facilities.

And that

is one of the huge reasons for the difference between reproduc­
tion cost,

of the old facilities and the cost of substitute

facilities.
Respondent argues that the doctrine should be extended
to private facilities and asks*, to put a har'd case* why should it
be when the United States Government takes a city school* a public
school* the city is compensated with the cost of constructing a
new school.

But if the city were to take a parochial school*

right across the street* the non-profit church that owns the
parochial school would not be entitled to such compensation*
only to the fair market value.
We think there are a number of explanations* even
assuming that the doctrine should be applied to public facilities
Ln the first place* or even assuming that it should be applied

15
in particular to public facilities like schools, for which fair
market values can be established* as distinguished from where
the doctrine started* streets and highways* which have no fair
market value.
For one thing* the public entity is often under — The
assumption in the case of the public entity* for the doctrine to
be applied* is that it is under a requirement to replace the
facility.

Now, this requirement can be legally enforced in

various ways in the case of the public entity.
It is true that a private entity, such as a church,
may say that it, too, is required to replace its school.
needs its school for its purposes.

It

It has children who are

attending the condemned school, and so forth.
One answer Is that in the -- One difference is that
in the case of the public entity the requirement is legally
enforceable,

A further answer is that if simple need to replace

Is the test why stop at private non-profit entities?

A business

firm which has its only establishment taken, its only manufac­
turing establishment, its only sales establishment, is surely
under as much factual need to replace it, as a. non-profit entity
would be or as a government would be.

And yet no one has sug­

gested that all this Court's prior rulings should be thrown out
and substitute facilities be substituted across the board for
the fair market value test.
A third difference is that if the facility is not, in

16

fact* constructed with the substitute facilities award, or if it
is constructed and subsequently sold or diverted to another
purpose* in the case of the public facility* there is assurance
that only the public will benefit from the money in any event.
Whereas* in the case of the non-profit private facility* one
cannot have that assurance,
A further difference is the need for* and the very
difficult task of

divising standards that arises once one goes

beyond public facilities.

And that difficulty is well illustrated

by this case* where the Court of Appeals first said the standard
was whether the non-profit facility was reasonably necessary.
Then* after the jury's negative verdict* the court relaxed the
standard and said the test is whether the facility provides a
community benefit.

And when we pointed out some of the diffi­

culties in determining what's the community and what's the
benefit* Respondent now does not defend the Court of Appeals'
latest opinion either.

Respondent simply contends that all

non-profit entities are entitled* so long as their facility is
devoted to any religious* public* charitable or educational
purpose.
The problem with that is it would cost a lot of money*
for one thing.

And we find it hard to find in the Constitution*

anything that says all non-profit entities are entitled by con­
stitutional command to the substitute facilities measure of
compensation.

Whereas* profit entities are not.

17

So those are the reasons why we think that if the
doctrine is to be recognized at all there is very good reason
for limiting it to public governmental entities.
Finally, there are in this case the First Amendment
problems that we have noted where a church is concerned.
QUESTION;

Before you get to that., Mr. Barnett, where

lies the authority, to define what is just compensation?
Exclusively with the Congress, with the courts or where?
MR. BARNETT:
Justice.

I think it is in the courts, Mr. Chief

Itfs a constitutional requirement which I think the

courts have the authority to -«* That is, the constitutional re­
quirement for just compensation, I think, is in the province of
the courts.
QUESTION:

Then this Court could say, in your view,

that just compensation means to do justice, presumably^ and
that when you take something away from a person you ought to
give him the equivalent.
MR. BARNETT:

The Court could say that, but it would

be inconsistent with what the Court has said.

In the recent

Bod caw case, for example, the Court of Appeals said something
very much like that, that our duty in eminent domain cases is
to do justice.

This Court reversed, saying, among other things,

the one principle to which it has always adhered is that com­
pensation is for the property and not for the use.
MR,, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I was only addressing myself

18

to the ultimate authority.
In your view then* I take it, that if a principle of
such longstanding in our jurisprudence were to change, it should
be changed not by the Court but by Congress?
MRu BARNETT:

Well, Congress can add to the compensa­

tion that is being provided.

Congress has done so in the Uniform

Relocation Act, for example,.

But I think Congress could not take

away from what this Court decided was required by the Constitution
as just compensation.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I am just talking about

enlargement.
MR, BARNETT:

Enlargement certainly should be done by

Congress or by state legislatures,
QUESTION:

Couldn’t they set the guidelines?

That's

where I get into trouble.
MR. BARNETT:

That's a difficult question.

federal taking, I would suggest perhaps not.

In a

In a state taking

where the Fourteenth Amendment is the vehicle,perhaps it would
have more leeway.
%

QUESTION:

There is no such thing as a state con-

demnation of a federal property, is there?

I suppose because

of the supremacy issue.
MR. BARNETT:

Not that I know of.

I meant the state

taking of private property,
QUESTION:

Certainly, itfhen a taking demolishes, let us

19

say, a small college in an isolated place, nondenomination, so
you keep away from the First Amendment problem that you are
about to address, there is no market for small colleges in
isolated areas, is there?
MR, BARNETT:

Well, there may be a market for

college-type facilities with campuses in isolated areas.

Busi­

nesses use them, all sorts of schools, other than colleges -QUESTION:

But it isn’t the kind of market you have

for real estate in Washington,
MR,, BARNETT:
further.

No,

In

such a case, you have to look

The Newton Girl Scouts case,

which is cited bythe

District Court in its opinion in the Appendix, makes clear that
when you have a fairly special kind of facility you may have to
look across the country rather than just in the neighborhood,
and you may have to wait longer

to get a purchaser.

doesn't follow that there is no

market at all for the facility,

QUESTION:

But it

Well, when I said no market — there is not

a very good market for college campuses and things of that kind,
is there?
MR, BARNETT:

Well, it may not be terribly active,

but certainly the land is marketable and the buildings, depending
on how many other things they are suitable for.

There are all

sorts of conference centers and retreats these days that thrive
on being in isolated places.
QUESTION:

So, I wouldnlt —

This case illustrates something

about the

20

marketability, how much market there is for boys’ camps.,
doesn't it?
MR, BARNETT:

Well* we put in testimony showing that,

indeedt there were* that there have been eleven comparable sales
within a seven-year period in this very county* of camps.

Of

course* that evidence was disputed.
QUESTION:

That's because it's up in the Pocono's and

you do have a large area there, don't you?
MR, BARNETT:

I think so.

If I may* I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr, Hess.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. OBER HESS * EEQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA
SYNOD OF THE LUTHERM CHURCH IN AMERICA
MR, HESS:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

/■

■

Court:
The essence of this case* I think* is best presented
by supposing three identical camps*

the first*a non-profit camp

owned by a governmental body* the second* a non-profit camp owned
by a non-governmental body* and the third* of which there are a
t

y.

significant number in this country* a private* commercial camp
operated for the profit of the owner.
I would take it that Petitioner has conceded that a
camp owned by a governmental body is entitled to just compensation

21

determined according to the substitute facilities doctrine,
QU.:*TION:

I didn't understand them to concede that.

MR. Hbhd;

Then* if I may rephrase my sentence, not

to dispute it at this time,
QU2.iTION:

But that would just be the Government's

opinion as to what the constitutional law might be.

It certainly

doesn't concede -“ his concession might not control this Court,
And this Court has never so held.
MR. Hbc',0:

Certainly, it Is open to this Court,

despite that very nice dictum of Chief Justice Taft in the
Brown case.

It is open to this Court to demolish the substitute

facilities doctrine,
QUbbTION:

You mean not to embrace it?

MR, Bibi*.:

To demolish it to the extent that it has

been followed* if the Court please,, in ten circuits and rejected
in none, and in some state courts as well.
QUb sTION:

Well, surely we are not bound by the

holdings of the Courts of Appeals.
MR, Hfido :

Indeed, not.

My point merely is that it has had a universal ac»
ceptance in the circuits.
Whether it concedes it or not is not altogether the
point,

The point is that*as the -decided cases in the circuits

now stand, a camp owned by a governmental body would certainly
be entitled to the substitute facilities doctrine.

22

QUrdaTION:

Mr. Hess» is it perfectly clear that the

doctrine would apply to a government-owned piece of property,
such as a camp?

As I understand it, there is some argument

about that in the lower courts.
MR* Hiop:

I base my statement that it would upon the

comprable cases involving bath houses, recreation centers» play­
grounds and public parks.

I would put them in an indistinguishable

category with camps.
QUESTION:

And there is the same uniformity of that

category of cases?
MR.

:

Yes „

Now, as to the commercial» ncn-prof it,. campt it clearly
is not entitled to have its award determined under the substitute
facilities doctrine.
The question here» as we see it» is whether just
compensation for a non-profit camp owned'by a ..non-governmental
body is to be determined as it is for a governmental camp or
as it is for the commercial camp.
The governmentally owned camp receives an award based
on the substitute facilities doctrine when three conditions are
met»

first, that the fair market value is insufficient to obtain

a functionally equivalent camp.

It is not a question of whether

there is some kind of market for the disposition of the condemned
camp, but whether there is a replacement market in which a sub­
stitute could be purchased for the equivalent of the award.

23

That's the first test*
The second is that the camp was fully used before the
taking and# third# that the taking itself did not eliminate the
use fte the camp.

There would be no qualitative evaluation of the

benefit of the camphor for that matter of a bathhouse or school
or a playground or park.
The benefit in the case of a governmentally owned -operated and owned facility -- the benefit is presumed from the
fact that the governmental entity decided to have a camp and that
fche camp was fully used.

There is no requirement that the govern­

mental unit be legally obligated to replace the condemned facility.
And that is all spelled out very clearly in a note in the Yale
[aw Journal which is cited in our brief.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. OBER HBit „ ESQ „ s (Resumed)
MR, HESS:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Immediately prior to our noon recess, 1 was pointing
out that under existing decisions a non-profit camp operated by
a governmental body would have to show, in order to bring into
play the substitute facilities doctrine, three things.
The Synod,that Is Respondent, just seeks precisely the
same treatment here.

It, too, must demonstrate the fair market

value will not be sufficient to obtain a functionally equivalent
camp.

The replacement market must be taken into account, and

secondly that its camp was fully used prior to the taking, and
thirdly that the taking itself did not eliminate or destroy the
use.
The benefit of the camp, as In the case of the govern­
ments !ly o^vned camp,, is presumed from the fact that it is run
on a non-profit basis and is devoted to public, charitable,
educational or religious purposes0
QUESTION:

I am not quite sure I understand the third

of those criteria,
MR, HESS:

The third is included because this is the

familiar category in which non-profit activities which are

25

classified in the quasi-public corporation category, are expressed»
This is the way the category is expressed and so expressed in
many places in the law* a non-profit corporation operated for
charitable* educational or religious purposes -- public charitable*
educational or religious purposes,
QUESTION:

You say it is expressed in many places »»

like the Internal Revenue Code?
MR, HESS:

Yes, a number of times in the Code and else»

where in our jurisprudence.
Now, in this case, we are not talking about the tennis
club or the swimming club or the country club.
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Where* other than the Internal

Revenue Code?
MR, HE&w:

Well, in the Constitution of Pennsylvania,

for example* and in real estate tax exemption cases, such as
existed in New York which came under inspection in Walz v „ Tax
Commission,, to which I will presently refer in another context»
As I say* we are not talking about our country clubs»
They certainly would not qualify»

In a sense* they are non»

profit* but they are not devoted to public charitable* educational
purposes and have no proper claim to be included with non-profit
organizations which operate and which are encouraged, I submit*
by our public policy to operate.
QUESTION:
clinic once a week?

What if a country club gave a free golf

26

MRo Hehi^ :

Well, I would not think, Your Honor, that

that would put it in the category of a non-profit corporation
operated -- organized and operated for public charitable,
educational or religious purposes,

I would not think so.

These non-profit corporations, I refer to, which do
operate and are encouraged by a public policy to operate non­
profit facilities for public charitable, educational and, yes,
to religious purposes.

We are talking about that category alone,

such as the Synod in this case.

And we are talking about non­

profit camps and schools and hospitals and hones for the aged
and similar eleemosynary institutions.
For Fifth Amendment purposes, we submit, they are
clearly distinguishable from the commercial condemnes.

They

stand, rather, in a position identical with the governmental
condemnee*
Now, the commercial camp owner

and this is an

important point -= the commercial camp owner, having decided to
use his capital in the commercial market place, must also have
his just compensation determined in the commercial market place.
Now, that’s no hardship.

The value of his facility takes into

account its profitability and its earning power, and he is made
whole by an award that provides him with an opportunity, through
investment or otherwise, to receive a comparable return on his
capital investment.
QUtbTIQN:

What if a non-profit company paid its

27

director a salary that the Government claimed was three times
what a comparable director would receive?

Would that be a

litigable issue in this sort of condemnation* that it called it­
self a non-profit company* but was really a way to give a very
fancy salary to the chief executive?
MR* HLri;, :

That would contradict the non-profit -- It

might go to contradict it.

It would depend on many other things*

You know* one swallow doesn't make a summer, but it would cer­
tainly go a long way to contradict the non-profit status*,

if it

were just a way to siphon off a huge salary for some person's
private benefit*
That's not this case,,

It is not contended that that

is this case*
Now* as I've just said — and I mean to emphasize this
point

that non-profit corporations are encouraged by public

policy in this land to operate these non-profit facilities for
public charitable and educational purposes*, and religious* too
-- I include that*

This policy just lies so deep in the American

tradition* which leaves large measures of public good to be
provided in whole or part by non-profit organizations*

Countless

voluntary hospitals* homes for the aged* schools and colleges -QUESTION:

What words -« Mr* Hess, I agree on tax

exemption and all those thing©,,.

But here you are asking the

Government to give you some money*
MR* H.SS&:

I am not asking the Government* Your Honor*

28

to give us any money.

I am asking the Government to give us

just compensation,
QUfiiTION:

You are asking the Government to give you

the difference between $740,000 and $3 million.

That*3 what you

are asking for,
MR, E04>?:

I am asking for just compensation.

QUESTION:

Is that in dollars and cents,, what you are

You are asking for money.

MR, H-hcft:

Our evidence was to the effect ““..and It wasn'

asking?

contradicted because we didn't get into that phase at the trial.
The Government had a witness there on substitute facilities
values.

He was not called because we didn't get into that

phase of the case,

Our testimony was to the effect that a

substitute facility would cost around $4.3 million.

And that

shouldn't be a shocking figure because this was a big operation.
This had a capacity of 600 children at the time, these three
camps combined, and out of that three -- X don't remember off­
hand, although it is in the record, what went to make up that
total of $4.3 million, but two items come to my mind.

Replac­

ing the sewage facilities, alone, was $400,000, plus.

Replac­

ing the water system was $400,000, plus, which makes ridiculous
the $740,000 fair market figure, if we come to consider the
question of what is just compensation.

29

What is just?
According to the cases, It is what's equitable, what's
fair.
And we submit that that's not fair and we say that the
public policy of this country, which I was referring to, entitles
us to be treated the same as a governmental condemnee, because we
are in that category, and in a very real sense the Government
does not and need not and probably should not provide all these
facilities.

There should be some range left for the type of

facility we are talking about here.

And to a large extent,

these non-profit corporations, in this category, are really surogate to Government.

And whan their facilities are condemned,

our position is that they should not be treated differently from
the governmental owner of similar facilities.
It is this very policy, of encouraging volunteerism
which makes non-profit corporations of this category quasipublic corporations, in the language which was used in Walz v.
Fax Commission.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hess, in your emphasis on the justice,

which of course is the bottom line in a case like this, is it
really just,if your view is correct, to treat a profit corpora­
tion -- they give it $700,000 when it is going to cost them
$5 million to stay in business?
MR. Hi££S:

Now, Your Honor, that's a different category,

as X. endeavored to point out.

The commercial corporation, when

30

Its facility is condemned **«■> take the commercial camps -- a very
Important item of evidence on value for condemnation purposes
would be the profitability of the facility»

And the commercial

camp would and should get an award that would be sufficient to
protect that profitability»

It may not be enough to buy another

camp» because the price of facilities may have gone up so greatly
that it would be folly to take that money and put it into another
camp.

But it ought to be enough to produce a deal comparable to

what the commercial camp produced»
QUESTION:

And that --

Let's take this example»

Supposing the fair-

market value of the property is $700*000* but the earnings of
this camp are enough to justify a $5 million investment* but it
just doesn't have it.

What should be paid in that case?

Just

the $700 v/ouldn't it?
. MR. HLic:
QUESTION:

You mean to us, a non-profit -No* no»

I want to try and think it through

in terms of a profit-making corporation.

Assume that it is a

very* very profitable camp* but the real estate only has a fair
market value of $700*000«
MR. HESS:

If Your Honor pleas®, in a condemnation case*

the value of the real estate would take very largely into account
its profitability»

That's a common type of evidence where a com­

mercial facility is condemned.

The jury takes into account

whether that was a profitable facility.
QUESTION: . Even if all the comparable sales were at

31
$700,000?

MR. Hgas-

Yes.

I think I've said enough about the public policy in­
volved here, the public policy which leads us to the conclusion
that we should have treatment comparable —

dence cases* but it would be a different case than this.

This

case is* we were in full swing, there was full use before the
taking and the taking did not* itself* destroy the use* as in
the case of a country road leading* through a condemned dam site*
to nowhere,
QUESTION:

You could also make your argument in the

case where an organization was about to -- had great plans to
build a camp* and they got right up to it and they suddenly
announced that* "We are abandoning our plans because we haven't
got the money to build it*" and then the Government condemns.
And they said* "Gee* it xvould be nice if you paid us enough
money for this land to build a camp,"
MR, HEtf£: That would not be this case* or anything

33
closely resembling it*

Mr* Hess, does "charitable" mean something

more than non-profit, in your definition?
MR * HESS:

Well, yes, it is a broader word than "non­

QUESTION:

What if, instead of Lutherans, these had

been very wealthy Episcopalians that had gone to this camp?
MR* HGsS :

If it8s operated on a non-profit basis for

wealthy people who could pay and don't, 1 suppose that puts it
in the category of a country club*
QUESTION:

Even a Lutheran country club?

MR* HESS:

The Episcopalians have the money and have

i-ft, «»•..

the good intentions*
(laughter)
QUESTION:

Mr* Hess, I suppose your approach here would

be the same if this were a non-profit denominational hospital?
MR* HESE:

Precisely*

We submit that whether the condemns© is a municipal
corporation or a non-profit, charitable, educational corporation,
just compensation should be the same, and I think the Third
Circuit put it very well in its opinion*

On the first appeal,”

34
says fche First Circuity "We are not dealing with congressional
largess."
It

corigs

back to Your Honor’s question.

We are not

dealing with congressional largess which might justify a distinction between governmental and non-governmental community
facilities.

Bather, says the Third Circuity "We are dealing with

judicial interpretation of the Taking Clause»

Accepting the

interpretation that it protects the value of community uses,
there is no basis distinguishing between governmental and
private community uses."

That's the Third Circuit.

I might just add that it is further indicative of
this approach that the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws have
promulgated and recommended for the adoption by the states a
code of condemnation containing — in which they have adopted
the substitution doctrine for non-profit corporations, on a
basis similar to what we are contending for here.
The Government does not dispute ~~ I think they don't
dispute

and it has been uniformly decided, in every case where

it has come up to date, that subordinate state governmental units
get their condemnation awards under,and only under, the same
Fifth Amendment Clause which applies to us.
For this purpose, cities, school districts, townships
and towns are treated .the,;same as private condemnees.

The Fifth

Amendment Clause refers to the taking of private property for
public purposes.

And for this purpose, these state units are

35
treated the same as we.
QUESTION:

Why shouldn'fc

right of eminent domain* while they are at it?
MR0 HES-i:

I am sorry I didn't understand Your Honor.

You say it’s just like a county or a city*

QUESTION:

We want an award of Just compensation.

MR. HESS:

QUESTION:

Arid that *s the Government giving the money

to a church? Does that mean that the Government will be giving
the church that money! the Lutheran Church that money?
MR. HESS:

The Southeastern Pennsylvania Synod of the

Lutheran Church of America is the Respondent here.
QUESTION: •■Asad that's who would be getting the money?
, MR. HESS:

That's right.

They are the owner of the

property.
QUESTION:

Well* that would be true whenever their

property xvas condemned

36
QUESTION:

No, but the difference is — I am net

talking about the $740

I am talking about the difference

between $740 and $5 million,
MR* HESb

That is the Cost of the substitute facilities*

$4*3 million., I■ think, is the testimony*
QUESTION:

Well, when it gets to the millions, that's

millions*
MR* HE&B: And the same thing was true of the bathhouse
case in New York*

The award that was given, before the substi­

tute facilities applied — or at least the testimony was — it
was about $5 million and about $1*5 million was what was de­
termined under the substitute facilities application*
I would like to make this further point*

The Govern­

ment tries to make a distinction by saying the governmental
unit Is under some kind of legal necessity and we are not*

Now,

that distinction, 1 think, fails on two counts, first, the legal
necessity has been ruled out, at least in the Second and Eighth
Circuits, and a different test applied that makes it discretion­
ary with the governmental unit.

But secondly, in this ease, it

can be guaranteed that we will use the ■»«» if there is any doubt
about it — that we will use the award for creation of a sub­
stitute facility and it can be done so under Section 285 of the
Federal Condemnation Statute,
by making the award in trust for
i■
release as the facility is built*
This treatment is available, in our opinion,; under the

37
general language of Section 285(a),and the Yale Law Journal Note
cited in our brief, thinks so, too.
One final point.

The Government charges that to apply

the substitute facilities rule to us is to give us a windfall.
I think this may be in Mr. Justice Marshall's mind.
The Government says that we would get new buildings
for what may have been dilapitafced buildings, with no adjustment
for depreciation.
Now, this assertion is without foundation, first, on
a factual basis, because the fact is »«= the evidence shows it —
that our structures were not dllapitated, but were well main~
tained „
The further fact is that we —
QUESTION:

They weren't new, though?

MR* HESS:

They weren't new.

The further fact is, that we have stated in our brief,
that an adjustment should be made in the substitute facilities
award for the economies which new structures would afford.
Now* we do not concede that depreciation should be deducted.
That's a technical term, and one that, I think, has been used
too loosely in some of the cases.
ation should be deducted.

We do not concede the depreci

Depreciation is an arbitrary, com­

mercial accounting technique, whereby cost is recovered out of
current profits.
In substitute facilities cases, there is a projection

38
of the cost of the equivalent* with a discount.

In the

language that was used by the Second Circuits "That discount
by reason of the benefit which accrues to the condemnes* when a
new building replaces one with expired useful years»"
Now* the second Circuit was very careful not to refer
to depreciation* but instead did carefully refer to a "discount
by reason of the benefit which accrues."
And the second Circuit also reassured the Government
with these further words. "Even when substitution is required*
sumptuous awards need not be feared.
essential.

Exact duplication is not

The substitute need only be functionally equivalent.

The equivalence is one of utility,"
My friend raises the further point* which I think is
purely spectral* that we may take the award and apply it for
totally unrelated uses.

The same could be said for the award

to a city for bathouses and recreation centers.

But again* the

condemnation statute will protect this situation perfectly* be
the-

condemnee a municipal corporation or a non-profit corpora­

tion.
As to the future* the specter is projected* and the
Government says we may rebuild the camp and later discontinue
its use as such.
Again* we say that the same comment applies eq.ually
to the governmental condemnee.
Short of a sale of the camp* it is hard to see how the

39
use of such a single-purpose facility could be greatly altered,,
And if it is sold for other purposes, the price realized will
contain its own penalty.*in that the proceeds will in all likelihood be deficients as is the market value award already entered
in this case.
In closings may it please the Courts the question in
human terms, in this case, is whether the non-profit condemnees
can, with constitutional impunity, be expropriated and its fulluse, purpose and function forever destroyed.

That's the result

the Government seeks sanction for here.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Barnett, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R, BARNETT, ESQ,,
ON BEHAIF OF THE PETITIONER
MR-. BARNETT:

Just a couple of points, Mr, Chief

Justice, if I may.
My brother's key argument for the applicability of
the substitute facilities doctrine here is to an entity like
the Eynod for these camps is that, as he says, public benefits
are presumed from the fact that the facility is run on a non­

profit basis, and devoted to a charitable, educational or
religious purpose.
Now, I am not clear, from his position, whether the
reliance is on the public benefit that these camps are said to

40

provide or whether it is simply on the fact that this is a
religious institution, and anything clone by this religious
institution would qualify,,
Some of his language would cut either way.
But if it’s the public benefit, then we see these
problems under the First Amendment,
QUESTION:

I thought he cleared that up somewhat when

he analogized it to a charitable hospital,
MR, BARN2TT:

Well, that’s it.

If he is then relying

on the good works, the public benefit that these camps provide -QUESTION:

The 'public served" is the term he —

MR, BARNETT:

Yes, all right.

To that extent it is

similar to the benefit to the community test of the Court of
Appeals,

And we see those problems with that, under the First

Amendment,

It has the court involved In determining whether

what a religious entity does provides a community benefit or
not,
In the Walz case» 397 U,S, 664, this Court said some­
thing very apropos to that, quote, "We find it unnecessary to
justify the tax exemption on the social welfare services or
good works that some churches perform for parishioners and
others.

To give emphasis to so variable an aspect of the work

of religious bodies, would introduce an element of governmental
evaluation and standards to the worth of particular social
welfare programs

tl

41

If, on the other hand-, my brother's position is ~~ and
that's what the language in their reply brief would imply ~~
that any religious purpose qualifies* then they are saying that
simply because It's a church doing something religious it
qualifies.

And it wouldn't matter then ivhether these camps were

converted into purely religious facilities or not.
Now,, on that basis*, we have the constitutional problem
that the award here on a substitute facilities basis of much
more than the fair market value of the camps -QUESTION:

How is that different from allowing the

National Cathedral, which I assume is tax exempt* or the Shrine

MR, BARNETT:

The difference between a tax exemption

created by a legislature and this Court saying that is what the
Fifth Amendment requires* and that the Fifth Amendment draws
that line between non-profit entity and profit-making entities.
The analogy is not the Walz case* but Tilt on v , Ric hards on or
the Nlquls case.

In both of those cases* this Court struck

down •»» in Tilton* it struck down unanimously the Federal aid
grant for the construction of facilities to the extent -QUESTION:

That was a giving of public money, as

distinguished from a recompense for a taking,
MR, BARNETT:

Well* we would suggest that here when

the award would be so much more than the fair market value of
the property, that it would amount to more than compensation.

42

It would amount to a giving,

And that on that basis it would

have constitutional problems when the recipient is a religious
institution and the facility could be engaged* on the second
theory* entirely in a religious function,
QUESTION:

Do I understand your argument* that they

might not stay in the same business?

If they get the $740*000*

they could stop the business* couldn't they?
MR0 BARN-ITT:

Yes* but their theory for getting the

$4 or $5 million is that they would stay in the same business.
That is* at least under the Court of Appeals approach -- that is
a premise on which they would be given ■»»
QUESTION:

How are you going to hold them to that?

MR, BARNETT:

That's precisely our point* that we

could not hold them to that,
QUESTION:

Why did you have a right to?

MR, BARNETT:

Well* because* under the Court of

Appeals' theory* that would be the basis for giving them that
amount of money* so that the camps could continue to function.
We do not espouse that.

We say the Government should

not be involved In trying to monitor what a church doss with
its money,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well* Mr, Barnett,

Thank you* gentlemen.
