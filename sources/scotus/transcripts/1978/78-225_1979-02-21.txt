PROCEEDINGS
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?
nesct in 78-22S, Babbitt

We will hear arguments

against United Farm Workers»

Mr, L@@t you may proceed whenever you®re ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E» LEE„ EBQffl,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, LEEs

©lank you, Mr, Chief Justice, and may

if. please the Court?
This is an appeal from a judgment of the three-judge
district court holding unconstitutional in its entirety
Arizona's Agricultural Employment Relations Act,
The invalidated statute is patterned after the
National Labor Relations Act,

That is, it guarantees

employe® organizational rights, provides for collective
bargaining, © secret ballot election process, it prohibits
asms twenty separate unfair labor practices, establishes an
Agricultural Labor Relations Board, gives that Board authority
to adopt rules and regulations, and generally to enforce and
implement the policies ©f the Act,
V

At the time that fills case went to trial, the
parties stipulated to twenty eases in which the Act had bean
applied in som© way.
boycotts®

Eight of those involved secondary

Six wer® ©lection proceedings, and six were

proceedings against employers because of unfair labor
practices, employer unfair labor practises as defined by the

4
ACte

The focus at the trial was not on these instances of
enforcement* for reasons that 1?11 develop in just about two
minutes•

Rather* the great bulk of the evidence at the trial

concentrated on expert opinion concerning how the Act would
probably be interpreted* and how it would probably operate»
The principal issue at the trial was how the election provisions
would fee applied* and how long it would take to hold an election
under the Act* in the view of these experts»
QUESTIONS

Didn’t it go beyond that?

Didn’t it

hypothesise the number ©f probable* likely situations?
MR® LEEs

Yes»

And how the Act would be interpreted*

given those situations®
QUESTIONS

First hypothetical facts and then

hypothetical* or assumptions about what the Act meant»
QUESTIONS

Yes»

MR» LEEs

Precisely* Mr. Chief Justice»

It was

built on two hypotheses * one was factual and one was legal»
Neither of which* we contend* was within the purview of the
district court»
Armed with that kind of a record* the court
specifically found constitutionally defective five specific
provisions ©f the Act; parts of four sections out of some
sixteen that the Act consists of* including one out of twenty
unfair labor practices»

And from this determination that, five

5
provisions were unconstitutional, the district court
invalidatedt struck down the entire statute»
The points of disagreement between the parties are —
in this ease are far more numerous than this Court is accustomed

to dealing with»

Indeed„ there isn’t even agreement between

the partias as to what the number of questions presented before
this Court is»
But careful analysis of those briefs reveals that
there ©re at least siss propositions advanced by the appellants
concerning which the appellees have either not joined issue at
all* or the joinder, if attempted, hasn't really meshed? so
that the point is effectively undisputed»

And fortunately

those six propositions, undisputed and undisputable, are
dispositive of the case before this Court»
As a consequence, 1 believe that the most helpful way
that I can use say scarce oral argument time of this afternoon
is to
QUESTIONi
MR® LEEi
QUESTIONS

Well, Mr» Lee, —
Yes?
•=“ you noticed how prompt the prior

counsel were»
MR® LEE i

Oh, I noticed that, Mr» Justice White,

and I realise there's no constitutional obligation to take all
©f my time»
QUESTION s

Yes

6
MR® LEEs
QUESTION i
MR® LEEt

1 appreciate that®
Yas.
But whan you®re dealing with somewhere

between seven and ten questions presented9 and each of the ten
raises many sub issues* there is some problem of allocatione no
matter how one attempts to be prompt <=*■» which I assure you I
will do®
S© X9d like to concentrate on these sise propositionsB
The first two concern whether this dispute really
amounts to a ease or controversy at all®

The appellees lay

great stress on the enforcement stipulation®
instances in which the Act has bean enforced.

There are twenty
But the fact

that is not disputed is that of the five provisions held
unconstitutional by the district court* namely* the sections
dealing with election and truthful publicity* binding
arbitration* free access to employer facilities* and the
provisions making violations a misdemeanor — not one* not a
single one has ever been applied to any of these plaintiffs®
There is

indeed* the only section that's ever been

applied to any one of those five is the election provision*
and that's not to these plaintiffs®
Now* there is an attempt by the appellees as to one
of these provisions * subsection 8 of the Unfair Labor Practices *
the one that prohibit® untruthful publicity* to join issue * but
they don't really do so®

7
The fact of the matter is that in one case only,
Case NOo 2, the Safeway case, there was an allegation in the
complaint of a violation of subsection 80

But the Superior

Court, the trial court, made a preliminary daterm!nation, a
threshold determination that the union’s conduct in that case
was a sufficient compliance with subsection 8 and, as a conse~
quence, it has never been applied,,
And we are left with this fact, that of all of those
twenty instances, not one has ever been applied to these
plaintiffsa
The second point of no real dispute is this, and it
concerns the law dealing with this kind of cases

1 know of no

case, and in the six years of this litigation our opponents
have not bean able to suggest any, in which this Court has
approved the consideration in its entirety of a c amp reh ensi ve
regulatory statute, whose provisions raise a variety of separate
constitutional questions in advance of, and in the absence of,
the application of those provisions to particular individuals *
QUESTIONs
your problem here?

Mr« Lee, may I just ask a question about
Supposing the election procedure is so

cumbersome and the timing is so bad that they could never have
an election, could they ever challenge if?
Because by the whole hypothesis on which their argu~
meat is built, it is that they could never get an election in
any event? and 1 think your argument is, "Well, that’s just too

bad, we've got an unconstitutional statute here that can never
be challenged,"
MR, LEEs
Stevens,

Let me answer it in two parts, Mr, Justice

That is an issue, of course, that is applicable only

to the election procedures
QUESTIONS
MR, LEEs

Right,
*»- not to the entire Act,

QUESTIONS
MR, LEEs

That8s an important part of the case,
But even so, I would feel much more

comfortable if at least they had tried to hold an electiora,
and there had been some demonstration, some facts on the record
that in fact it takes too long to hold an election.

Here

there is simply an assumption that it takes too long, an
assumption that is entirely unfounded,
QUESTION? Well, that goes to the merits of whether
they’re right or not.

But for purposes of standing and case or

controversy, don't we have to assume that there’s merit to
their argument?
MR, LEEg

Yes, we certainly do.

think, is nevertheless valid.

But my point, I

That at the very least, with

regard to case or controversy, as it applies to elections,
that you have to at least have tried and. at least to have
shown that in fact there is some —• on the merita, the election
issue depends on delay,
QUESTIONS Well, Mr, Lee, what issue is it on the

9
elections with respect to the difficulty in having it?

I mean,

Arizona didn’t have to pass a law giving them any election at
all, did it?
MR® LEEs

Of course not®

And, in the final analysis, as we point out in our
brief, ‘the only thing that they ara saying is that whereas
before Arizona had no election, now it has an election process?
but what they are really complaining about is that Arizona
did not go far enough and provide enough protection for
associations! interests as perceived by the appellees, and
there is this ease from the Eastern District of Virginia that
says very clearly that there is no obligation on any Stata to
do that®
QUESTIONs

You'd almost have to say the National

Labor Relations Act was constitutionally mandated, if one were
to say that®
MR® LEEs

Well, but you have problems even there®

Because the district court and the appellee® have both made the
statement ““ and this is their language “<= that the provisions

ox t!i® National Labor Relations Act dealing with elections
and provisions of the AEBA dealing with ©lections are virtually
identicalo
QUESTIONS

Isn’t there a difference that ~=» didn’t

the election procedure make it unlawful to proceed without an
election?

That is, to have a bargaining representative

10
voluntarily recognised?
MR® LEE %

No, I don't think it aver says that, Mr®

Justice Stevens®
QUESTIONS
MR® LEEs

Well, does it?
That’s been a point of dispute

between us

and the appellees all throughout this entire procedure®

I find

nothing in this statute that says you cannot have voluntary
recognition®

There is dispute about the bargaining order

provision and there is dispute about the voluntariness, but
that simply brings us backs

We ought not to be here talking

about issues of Arizona law® And that’s really what is involved
there, is issues of Arizona law®
QUESTION?

The record doesn't tell us whether any

attempt by a bargaining representative, who had not been
selected by means of an election, was nullified because ha wasn’t
elected?
MR® LEEs

I find none®

QUESTIONS

So that is hypothetical in that sense,

MR® LEEs

Yes®

then?
This case is here far too soon®

We pointed to the Watson and McAdory cases in our
brief, that those cases are squarely on point®

Those involved

comprehensive statutes®
Coming back. Justice Rehnquist, to your analogy to
the National Labor Relations Act, that’s the analogy of both®

11
This is a fair description of both of those statutes*

Each of

them consists of organisational guarantees,, collective
bargaining guarantees # prohibition of unfair labor practices #
the establishment of an administrative agency with power to
implement th© Act»

How*, that's both statutes# in a word*

It is unthinkable that this Court would have permitted
any court,. Federal or State# to start at the beginning of the
National Labor Relations Act? wade through all of its pro»
visions# declare five parts unconstitutional# when none of them
had been enforced as to any ©f the plaintiffs? and then# based
on that kind of determination# hold the whole statute
unconstitutional»
Now# there are statements coming out of this Court
condemning that kind of practice#

reaching all the way back

from Justice Holmes' day to —* the opinion says February 20th#
but I was cautioned by the Chief Justice that it really should
say February 21st*
Mr® Justice Powell's opinion for the Court this
morning# in Friedman vs» Rogers # it was the same problem*

These

people who were commercial optometrists said# "Wa fear that we
can't get a fair hearing before a body that is composed
substantially of the non»commercial optometrists'* ? and Justice
..-t ,. - -. i__

Powell acknowledged that they were entitled# under the Gibson
and Wall cases# to a fair hearing®
But then the ©pinion goes on to say# in both Gibson

12
and Wally however? disciplinary proceedings had been instituted
against the plaintiffs and the courts were able to examine in a
particular context the possibility that the members of the
regulatory board might have personal interests that precluded
a fair and impartial hearing of the charges9
In contrasty Rogers challenged that the fairness of
the board does not arise from any disciplinary proceeding
against cases.
In a wordy election casest the constitutionality of
the election provisions ought to be decided in election cases.
At leaste Mr® Justice Stevense we would than know if, in fact#
there are problems in doing it®

Access to employer's facilities

ought to ba daeied in an access case? and unfair9 untruthful
publicity ought to be decided in a case that at least involves
union publicity9
QUESTIOHs

I'm still puzzled, because I’ve been

troubled in the past about procedure for reviewing elections
under the National Labor Relations Act, you've got to, you know,
win the election and then hav© it challenged®

Supposing they

hold an ©lection and they lose, what do they do?

How do they

get it reviewed?
MR® USBs

Well, I think that at that point at least

you would have established factually that there was a delay
problem if there is a delay problem? and I think at that point
you can some in to federal court®

13
1811 grant yon that the election cases » the election
cases do present a unique situation* But herep where you've
never even tried„ where there is nothing anywhere that shows in
faefe that there is delay*, and where we vigorously dispute that
there is a delay problem ■»- mid I'll develop that in just about
two minutes *»«= this is not the kind of case that 'the Court ought
to be deciding «■»«
But you would say» for standing purposesg

QUESTION*

if they had requested an election and somehow or other they
didn't succeed with it, that would solve the problem?
MR*LEE%

Well» it would if» in fact» you could show

that th© factual premise on which your attack is being based
was in fact correct*

I think the case or controversy would

require at least that*
QUESTIONs

You still sound a little bit like you're

saying you've got to win on the merits to have a case or
controversy? but maybe you don't mean that*
MR* LEEs

Well» this is another of

those instances

in which there is a very close relationship between the merits
and ease or contr©very*
But I do think that you need to do more than just
make the formal application*

I think you need to shot*; that

th© factual predicate of the constitutional issue that you're
raising is **>*« in fact» othewi.se you're bringing the federal
machinery into play when it may not make a difference*

14
And that? of course# also closely relates to the
abstention question»
Isd like to turn nox*? to a closely related issue? which
is the severability question»

And hare the dispositive

realities that have not been disputed are twos

The first is

that the test for severability? as ife has been announced in
this Court? is the Champlin test that is cited
our briefs

at page 77 of

S'0nless it is evident that the Legislature would

not have enacted those provisions which are within its power?
independently of that which is not? the invalid part may be
dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law»1'
As I read the modern cases dealing with severability?
including? most importantly? Tilton and Jackson? that is the
leading statement of the law of severability coming from this
Court at the present time»

That case is not acknowledged? it's

not even cited by our opponents j end 1 submit that the reason
is a recognition that that test cannot be satisfied in this
case.
Applying that test? ife is nothing short of absurd
to say that Arizonars judgments? for example? that there should
ba

collective bargaining for Arizona? for agricultural labor?

©r that a union should not be permitted to picket the homes of
agricultural workers or fine one of its members because he
gives testimony before the Board? or that an employer should
not be permitted to dominate a union or contribute financial

15
support or discriminate against an employee because of union
activitiest and many others», in any way depend on whether there
has been an election®

Or whether compulsory arbitration is

constitutional; ©r whether there is access to employer
facilities, regardless of how you come out on those five issues,
The Arizona Legislature has concluded that Arizona
needs am Agricultural Labor Relations Boardt and. that that Board,
needs tea authority to prohibit 19 out of 20 uninvalidated,
unfair labor practices®
The magnitude of the district court there is
illustrated by the fact that Arizona is now prevented from
controlling unfair labor practices that not even the appellees
contended were unconstitutional, including, irony of all ironies,
employer unfair labor practices®
Look at the enforcement stipulations®

Just about a

third of these cases were eases in which the employer had
discriminated against his employees because of their union
**

activities®

My client, the State of Arizona, has a legitimate

interest in preventing that kind of employer conduct® And in
those instances where there has been employer retaliation, in
bringing into play, on the employees5 side of the conflict, the
weight of the Stata to prevent that kind of employer conduct®
And the same in ths event 'that the union has taken improper
action against its own members®
1 come now to the most important substantive question

16
and that is the constitutionality of Section 1389 dealing with
electionso

The district court made it very clear that this

was its pivotal holding, the most important substantive holding,
and this is one of the provisions that was invalidated on the
basis of the “’evidence68? but the evidence that the court found
relevant was not evidence developed in any actual case or
controversy»
As the Chief Justice pointed out, it was based on a
twin hypothesis?
interpreted»

how the Act would work and how it would be

And it was that hypothetical, not any of the six

election cases that have actually been held, it was that
hypothetical that waa held unconstitutional*
Now, even aside from the obvious case or controversy
problem with that kind of approach, what substantively was
wrong with this election procedure?

And the thing that was

wrong with it is that in soma instances if might be impossible,
the district court hypothesised, to hold an election during
the employment peak»
Nov.7, there is no dispute that the problem of how you
solve elactions during an employment peak is an important one»
If is also one whose optimum solution is not readily apparent»
The National Labor Relations Board has adopted one
solution to that problem»
Act has adopted another»

The California Agricultural Labor
The NLRB solution is to hold the

election during the next employment peak,? and the California

17
procedure •»*» the California solution is to hold the election
rather quickly.» to decide only the question of representationa
And then7 once that's decided, defer all other issues until
after the elections
There is absolutely no authority, except the opinion
which we ask this Court to reverse, that has ever held that the
selection of either of these solutions raises significant
constitutional problems«,
flow, in that respect alone, the district court's
decision is surprising enoughs,

But the absolutely incredible

feature of the district court's holding is that it has
invalidated an election scheme that permits and indeed
anticipates the adoption of either alternative, according to
the needs of the particular case*

That has never been

disputed, it has never been disputed*

And even if you assume

that one of those or the other could be held unconstitutional,
even as a matter of abstract theory the position cannot be
taken, that a procedure which permits the adoption of either
according to the needs of the particular case is unconstitu~
feional»
There is a statement in the motion to affirm to this
effects

that the Act must be nullified in all its provisions

and returned to the Legislature to strike a new balance*
find that statement absolutely, intriguing»
to be stuck?

I

What new balance is

18
As I read the district court’s opinion and the
appellees’ briefs, the only constitutionally
alternative is the California Act»

acceptable

And yet Arizona law *—

this has not bean disputed by our opponents *»«* permits the
adoption of the California procedure»
Now, pursuant to Justice White’s urging, let me
simply take about thirty seconds, Mr» Chief Justice, and just
observa this 3
First, with regard to the truthful publicity, I think
that Friedman vs» Rogers is a valuable additional case that
bears on the question of the extent of Arizona’s authority to
prohibit untruthful speech»

And I’m referring particularly to

the comments on page 8 of that opinion»
With regard to compulsory arbitration under the
Seventh Amendment and substantive due process, our opponents
have virtually thrown in the towel»

They have an additional

argument — I will deal with that in response, if it needs to
be dealt with? I’m not sure what position they take in it»
And, finally, with regard to access to employer
facilities, as we point out in our brief that depends on three
assumptions»

They have not disputed the fact that it depends

on three assumptions, and they have really only attacked one
of the three»

And for these and many other reasons, we submit

that the federal district court should never have been involved
in this ease in the first place, it committed numerous errors,

19
th© most egregious of which was its deciding a dispute that is
not a case or controversy? and we submit that its judgment
should be reversed.
QUESTIONt
ask you.

Mr. Lee*. I have two questions l8d like to

Does the record

and I have not read the

enforcement stipulation* but doss that or anything else in the
record tail us whether there have ever been any successful
elections in which unions have been -*»
MR. LEEs

Yes„ there have.

QUESTION?
MR. LEE s

Thera have been some?
Yes.

QUESTION %

Where it has been invoked, and it8s not

possible to invoke it.
MR. LEE s

That8s right.

QUESTION: /hid the second question I had?

you

commented about the truthful publicity aspect of the statute.
Do you have any particular response to the brief of the amicus*,
the American Federation of Labor and CIO* about the part of the
statuta that prohibits comment when there's a trade name or
something like that* that has part of the people involved with
the union and others are not *=*- you know what I mean.
MR. LEE s

The Swing problem.

QOS3TIQN:

Yes. Right.

MR. LEE?

Very simply this* Mr. Justice Stevens.

The Swing case* as you know* arose in your State and it was a

20

beauty parlor, they lost the election, and then they continued
to picket around the Swing beauty parlor®

That, we submit, is

an entirely different case, because the pressure there was
primarye

It was around the target of the organisational

activity»

And it's a very narrow opinion, and Justice

Frankfurter makes it vary clear that that's all it applies to
is the facts of that case»
By contrast, what we have here, in so far as the
second part of sub 8 is concerned, is secondary pressure that
is brought to bear®

And if the national Labor Relations Act

shows us anything, it is the distinction in this respect
between secondary pressure and primary pressure®
QUESTION?

But again it's strictly informational

picketing that they're concerned about, isn't it?
MR® LEEs

Yes®

But I think the clear message coming

?

from

Surbets, for example, which has no suggestion that that

ease was constitutionally faced, is that in so far as secondary
pressures, if they are
will ha upheld®

unless they go too far, that they

Once again this is a fallback position on the

case or controversy» We need to know what the facts are»

In

Swing we had the actual facts of that case, but there is a
distinction, I submit, of constitutional dimension between
primary pressures,

such as were involved in Swing on the one

hand, and secondary pressures
in that aspect of the decision»

such ae are claarly involved

21
But on this aspect of the ease* going

QUESTION?
bask to your

whole standing problem, you do have a First

Amendment issue, and the argument is that the statute in effect
is overbroad here, and so, under the classical overbreadth
standing doctrine, wouldn’t the standing be okay in this case?
As to that particular portion of the statute»
And if not, why not?
MR» LEE: Well, I don’t believe that this is a proper
ease for application of the overbreadth doctrine for these
three reasons»

The leading ©yerbreadth ease is Broadrick»

Broadrick says that the application of the overbreadth standard
depends on the miss of speech and conduct»
Here we don’t know what that mix of speech and conduct
is, and we won’t know until we actually have a case that
demonstrates it in the particular instance»
>

QUESTIONi But typically in an overbreadthvcase you
have a facial attack»

You, never know what the conduct is in

the overbroad
MR® LEEs

You do have a facial attack,

at least in Broadrick

’'but you,

Broadrick and his companions at least

had engaged in the permissible scope of the activity, that is
or, excuse me, the prohibifcafol© part of the activity, that
is campaigning for their bosses»

MR, LEE*

Do you think this is commercial speech?
I thought about that this morning as I

read Friedman vs, Rogers,

I don't think that my position

depends on it being commercial speech, but I think that they
are at least first, double-first cousins®
QUESTIONs
MR, LEEs

It's about wages, isn't it?
It's about wages, it's about economic

issues, and it's about who pays whom how much money,
QUESTION * Well, Mr, Less, you don't really think —»
do you think that to make a ease «=•*=» suppose I go into court arid
say, "Here's a law that says I may not speak in the following

23
manner^ and X assert that X desire to speak in that, manner,
and X think therefor© X am being restrained now and I don81
want to commit a crime,, X want you to adjudicate®5 ? don’t you
think there’s a case or controversy or not?
HRs LEE:

At that point you have to apply the Court’s

opinion in Broadrick vse Oklahoma»
things«

And that depends on several

One is, you will note that in Broadrick, Broadrick

had in fact engaged in the prohibitable component and therefore
you could see the mix of speech and conduct in so far, at least,
as far as the prohibitable

part was concerned,,

Secondly,

there is a caution in the Broadrick opinion that if the statute
needs fee be interpreted by the Stats court, then the over-»
breadth doctrine should b® leas
QUESTIONs

I^m talking about case or controversy

now*
MR* LEE:
QUESTION:

I understand*
Isn’t that enough, as I take it it was

implicit in Justice Stevens’ question, that if it forbid you
from speaking and you make the good»faith assertion that
**I want to speak this way, and X can’t unless I63

do X have

to violate the statute in order to make a «•*=
MR* LEE:

It would be easier t© answer that question,

I submit, Mr* Justice Whit®,
QUESTION:

Does all the defendant have to say, all

the Attorney General of the State have to say, "Well, I never

24
attempted to apply it to them** t is that all he has to say to
avoid the cassa or controversy?
MR» LEE*

Well, yon go back and you pick up Coates

issue that has bedeviled this Court» It*s been difficult to
answer that particular question, as 1 don't need to tell you,
Mr» Justice White»
QUESTION8 Well, X know, but then you say that you're
hanging most of your case around case or controversy, or not?
MR» LEEs

That's a pretty good argument, but it is

rA©fe most of the case»
QUESTIONS

I mean, you might be hanging maybe your

ease around some of the other provisions, but on this provision,
on this provision, was there an attack in the complaint on the
statute?
MR» LEE:

Oh, yes®

QUESTION:

On this particular provision?

MR» LEE:

Oh, yes»

QUESTION: And that they wanted to speak in this way,
and the statute prevented them?
MR* LEE:

QUESTION:
MR. LEE:

It's very important,

too, isn't it?

My only response is that it is a difficult issue
whether overbreadth applies to any kind of case.

Even if there's a case or controversy

about this particular issue doesn't mean that there is about
any other one in the case.

Of course.

Of course. And that’s the big

Mr® Cohen®

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME COHEN„ ESQ®„
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR® COHEN:

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court z
The attack which the United Farm Workers has made on
this statute is in large part a facial attack for overbreadth»
We alleged in our complaint that our speech rights were
suppressed®

There’s an enforcement stipulation? which starts

on pace 79 and goes through page 91®

This has happened to us®

Three temporary restraining orders„ without notice„ in the
area of First Amendment rights have been granted against us
before trial®
The judicial proceedings by which this statute is
enforced are found on page 536 of the statute and on page 532
of the Appendixt rather®

Any person aggrieved is allowed to go

to court and get. a temporary restraining order without notice
to stop speech activities®
1393“A and B®

The Board

and that is Section

That section was invoked by a liquor store®

Item 4f Item 7„ Item 13y page 84 and 88 of the Enforcement
Stipulatione temporary restraining orders were gotten®
The rule that this Court articulated in 1968 in
Carroll_ys« President and Commissioners of Princess Mne County

27
is that in the area of First Amendment rights there is no place
for temporary restraining orders without notice»
Rule 65 of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure are
incorporated to apply to this statute by the face of this
statute»

Rule 65 provides that a counsel need not attempt
■ i

i

notice, he can give reasons why notice should not be required»
We say that that's unconstitutional as applied in First
Amendment areas»
On page 17 of the reply brief, Mr» Lee suggests that
Rule 65 is not appreciably different from the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure» But the Federal Rules do not apply to
disputes between employees and employers»

The Federal Rules

do not apply to Norris^LaGuardia *»- do net preempt the Norris-

LaGuardi® Act, so that many kind® of injunctions against
speech cannot issue under the federal rules»
This rule, as interpreted by the Arison# courts,
allows for orders without notice®
QUESTIONs

Mr® Cohen, what happened in those three

cases?
MR» COHEN*

In those three cases we:

were picketing,

w® wera picketing the Gallo Win© Company in one of the cases,
and. fchsBfsssarcI Liquor Store went to court in Maricopa Countv,

1
Arizona, without notie©, to get a temporary restraining order
to restrain our activities®
QUESTIONS What happened after they got the order?

28
MR» COMEMs

The order was than dismissed for lack of

service» They then went to Maricopa County with the distributor#

QV Distributors# and they got another carder»
QUESTIONS

Then what

well# go ahead»

I’m sorry#

I didn’t want to interrupt you®
MR» COHENs

Oh# okay»

hnd they got another order»

That’s on page 88 ©£ the Enforcement Stipulation# which
restricted picketing» That order was gotten without notice»

MR» COHEMs

But then what happened t© that order?
That order was dismissed# the ease was

Has there ever been an order that prevented

you from picketing?
MR» COHENs

Has there been an order that prevented

us from picketing?
QUESTIONS
MR» COHEN i
QUESTION s
MR» COHENs

Yes»
Of temporary length# yes* which —
For hew! long?
Five cays# four days °° I don’t think

the length matters# because in Carroll the Court said that
it’s not the duration of the order that counts»

In that ease

there was a provision whereby the order could be dissolved
after five days# and the Comit said that it’s the fact of the
f

prior restraint on free speech# no matter how long# that’s
invalid

29
QUESTION 2

Brat if you have a history ©f another

three* say you get twenty more where you get a TRO without
notice* and you get them ail dismissed as soon as you get into
court* as fast as you can get counsel there* do they really
have any actual inhibiting effect on your clients?
MR* COHEN*

Yes * they do*

QUESTION*

If they know they are going to win all

these lawsuitse
MR* COHEN:

The order is issued*

It would be

contempt to violate the order until we can take steps to get
the order thrown out for some reason*

And we don’t think that

the union or its members should be inhibited for any length
of time*
QUESTION*

Carroll was a parade* %fasnet it?

MR* COHEN*

No* Justice Rehnquist, Carroll was a

QUESTION*

A rally?

MR* COHEN *

And Justice Fortas said that the facts

©f a public demonstration are the kinds of facts for which an
adversary hearing is needed*
QUESTION*

Then there “*»

Well* hasn’t this Court said that

picketing is a good, deal more than free speech?

In other

words* that it's more subject to regulation than straight-out
speech?
MR* COHEN*

Yes* Justice Rehnqtsist* but I’d like feo

30
point ©life that the State Board got an order*, which you'll find
is Appendix D to the briefr which prevents us from inducing
or encouraging the employs® or the manager of a retail store
from removing his products,.

That is feh® language of Section

7 ©£ the Aefef which is made# by Section 1392f criminal0
Ife is criminal to indue® ©r encourage feh© manager
©f a retail sfeor© fe© take off the product®

If Mr* Chaves#

who is sty client# the president ©f feh© Farm Workers Onion#
were to send a letter to the manager of the Phoenix Safeway
Store# for example# and say# “Please take off all lettuce#
because we ar© ©n strike afe Sun Harvafe6% that would be inducing
or encouraging that manager to remove that product® That is
a violation of Section (B)(7) ©f this Act»

It's mad©

criminal by Section 1392 ««=•
QUESTION:

And is that in the Enforcement Stipulation

fell afe you've been referring to?
MR, COHENs

No# but this is a facial attack# and I

think ife clearly falls within the shadow which CB)(7)

easts

over the First Amendmente
In the Enforcement Stipulation on page 80# the
Safeway Store did g© fee court and allege violations of various
provisions of -Section 1385 (Bl) •
certain activities*

They got an order restraining

They pled Section 7*

Now, the ferial judge in that case ruled that
Section 7 was unconstitutionally vague; but the Board# the

31
Agricultural Labor Relations Board, on pags 81 you*11 note,
filed a charge alleging violations of Section (B) {5} t

£3) (7)

and (B)(8) and they made us suspend, and we said it#s
unconstitutional? and tha Board said we don't have the
prerogative to rule on tha constitutionality of our own
statute»

Which 1 think points to the fact why we're in

federal court*
We have her® a problem where the Board can enforce
the statute against us, and private parties can enforce the
statute against us*
QUESTION?

Well, but the Board «— you appeared in

Superior Court and Judge Hardy gave you soma relief, did he

not?
MR» COHENs

Yes, but two years later, despite that

relief,, if you'll nefeie©, it's cm page 85, Section 11, the
Board, fiasepite what Judge Hardy did, went in to try and get
smother order based on Section {&)(7) again®

Despite the

fact that the Superior Court had said it was unconstitutional
two years before*

Wa argued that, but the Board proceeded under the
provisions of 1390(K) , which is on paga 532 ©£ the Appendix,
and asked for ©“ders without notice and they got the order
which we've appended m Appendix D to this brief»
So there have b@@n •»“ this is not a hypothetical eas©»
There have bean temporary restraining orders issued without

32
notie®«

Section (B)CO)t Mr, Lae claims that it’s never been

applied.
Walle if you'll turn to page 102 of the Appendix,
you'll find that a judge looked at Section (B)(6) and he
looked at the anion6s conduct, and he said we were in compliance
with (B)(8).
Now, X think it's tightrope walking on a verbal
tightrope over a constitutional abyss, to say that (B)(8) has
never bean applied,»

Because it has not been incorporated in

an order doesn't mean that some judge didn't look at the
standards of (B)(8) and apply it to our conduct*
In this pertinent language from the Chief Justice
in Organisation for a Better Austin vs»_ Keefe, when we talk

»

in that ease it was a question of whether leafletting that would
tend to coerce a real ©state broker, because of what was
alleged to be union blockbusting, could be restrained*

And

you said that in cases of that kind there is no room for a
test of truth or validity*

Which, in further statements of

said that administrative bodies, bureaucrats, judges cannot
judge the truth or validity of speech* Ever since Thornhill,

tools that are implicit in a primary boycott.
This statute makes it a crime for ns to speak, unless

And what the

found was this statute, Section 1385(C), 1 believe,

prohibits the Stats Labor Board from requiring the grower to
give a union time, materials, information or facilities with
which to communicate with workers.
QUESTION§

Well, Arisona doesn't have to require a

grower to give any time, does it?

The Constitution of the

United States, conceivably, but certainly Arisona doesn't have

36
to by statuta»
MR® COHEN:

1 think, Justice Rehnquist, the problem

that we have with this statute is that there have been other
ways of organising workers, that were available to farm workers
before the statute®

We could engage in economic activity, we

could engage in the boycott# which was outlawed*

They replaced

it with an exclusive election procedure# which# as the court
found# after extensive stipulations as to peak season and after
listening to th© testimony of the witnesses# and# after
examining the stipulation# there were elections®
They found that it was the *»<=» and by the language#
it’s 'the exclusive means of obtaining recognition*
Now# when it becomes the exclusive means of obtaining
recognition# and when# as the court found# we have a transient
work force with high turnover# we have intermittent, sporadic
work, it is impossible to communicate with the workers without
having soma access to them*

Arid I think we have here a

Wrightman vsa Mill fee argument, in that a private decision by a
grower is made*

He has access to the workers on his land,

in his samp, he can talk to them? but th© union is precluded
from getting onto his property*

I think that’s the problem

that we hav® here*
This is like th© residential community in Marsh vs*
Alabama*

This is not like the shopping center cases*

These

people live there in isolation, and they need to make informed

decisions about whether they should associate with a union»
QUESTIONg

Well, all the statute does Is say that

the grower has to give certain access.
MR® COHEHs

No»

The statute says that the grower

is not required to provide any time, any information, any
materials or any facilities to allow the union to communicate.

QUESTIONS

You mean every esc parte in junctiora

against a strike violates the First Amendment?
MR* COHENs

I think an ex parte injunction, without

notice , against picketing does violata the First Amendment,
because it’s a burden*

Whan you, look at the breadth of the

regulation, the burden that you would ba imposing on counsel
is not a very great one* As a practical matter, that counsel
knows, h@*s preparing his papers to enjoin the union*

We8re

not saying he has feo have formal notice, it could be formal
or informal*

They know the pickets are there* They can give

somebody notice* Fisk up the phone* It doesn’t stop him from
/
preventing — from presenting his papers, excuse me* But what
it does do, it allows him to present the facts without having
participation by the union*
And I think there are two reasons in a strike
picketing situation or a boycott situation where you need the
notice*

First, the facts in these matters are always

44
susceptible of various interpretations # and you need both
sides there to have a balanced presentation of the facts„
tody second# we need to be there to narrowly tailor and pin­
point that order9 so that we don't unnecessarily encumber the
First Amendment,.

MR® COHENs

QUESTIONS First ©£ all# you said that the election
was the exclusive means of obtaining recognition# as I under­
stood you»
MR® COHENs

Yes®

QUESTION? The district court's opinion at A«26 of
the Jurisdictional Statement points out that# "Before an
election can be held# the union must first demand and be
denied recognition by the employer»"
When I read that# I assumed that if the employer
had granted recognition# that then they could have proceeded
that than that would have been adequate to enable the
union fc© represent the employees»
MR» COHEN?

But# Mr® Justi©© Stevens# I*m referring

to the-- unfair labor practice section A(5) 9 that nothing in
this article shall ba construed as requiring an agricultural
employer to bargain collectively until a representative of

45
bis agricultural employees has been determined by means of a
valid secret-ballot election®
What I*m saying is that voluntary recognition, I
think, is a precondition? but there, are other ways of getting
recognition» For instance, what the MLRA has, card checks,
or the use of economic power»

are in the same situation that railway workers ware before

„

By filing the petition

the employer stops our

activity.
QUESTIONS

He stops the picketing,, but does he stop

the strike* too* necessarily?

You say* you know* half the

people won't go to work.
MR. COHENs

Well* that's not clear* Mr. Justice

Stevens.
QUESTION; That is not clear?
MR. COHENs

1 don't think that's clear.

QUESTION? tod one other question on election*
nsayo

Do you agree that tbere have been some

if I

^successful

elections?
MR. COHENs

No* there's only — there's been one

election. The elections are also in the Enforcement Stipulation. But I think if you look at the Enforcement Stipulation*
it bears up the district court's findings of fact* namely*
that the election procedure is unworkable.

The history of the

cactus ©lection is an illustrative one. By the time the
hearings had been gone through and set* the peak season had
expired —- as a matter of fact* the employees had left.

So

that the Teamsters Union* which filed for the petition* withdrew
fell© petition.
QUESTIONS But you do agree the record shows at least

4?
one successful election?
ME® COHENg

Yes? it does®

But, as Mr® Lee says in

his brief, h® says that in about 22 percent of the cases in
the citrus, the election procedure might, be workable®
What we®re saying is that we think that we have a
right to associate in an effective and meaningful way»

And

when you have, as your exclusive means of constraining an
employer t© recognise you, a procedure which, after extensive
findings ©f fact as to the length of season in the grapes,
which is three fc© five weak®, the length in the cantaloupes is
three to five weeks, the district court finds is unworkable?
they are saying, on the one hand you may hava it, but it*s
unworkable and we eanst achieve our goal»
QUESTION8

Well, do you think, if a State has a

statutory provision regulating labor management relations»
and one ©f the provisions is;

by the way, we don’t balisve

to© much in collective bargaining, and the employer need not
recognize any collective bargaining representative, although
unions are certainly legal and they can g© about their
business all they want to, of trying to coerce the employer
into recognising them? but as far as the law is concerned, 'the
employers are under no obligation to recognise any collective
bargaining representative»
MR» COHENs

No,

Would that be unconstitutional?
X think what amounts to an

unconstitutional restraint on us in this case is that we —

QUESTION* Well, how about my example?
MRa COHEN*

recognise us and bargain with us, •

MR* COHEN *

No, Mr» Justice White»

Our point is

that they are not* because what have they done to us?

They

have taken away our right to communicate with the public,,
That’s being criminal®
If we picket, and the employer files a petition
without, by the way, the protections of the NLRA, which says
that if the engineers have petitioned against themselves, that
is not; a bar? (B) (7) is not analogous to (B) (12) »
deliberately left that out®

They have

They stop our picketing»

If w® use the procedure, by tike time we get to a vote,
if w® could, as the district court found, it has taken too
long® We can’t get access, because the Board cannot engage in
~ we have a disagreement her©, but I think that if we examine
and anal?ze the statute, the fact that there may be workers
out there in the labor camp during the campaign, we may need to
talk to them, because they may move on»

We can't get to the

workers» We can’t talk to the public® We have an unworkable
©lection procedure®
tod, by the way, when you look afe Sections 1384 and

49
1385, you find that even if w® were to get there, it's also
criminal to eoere© or threaten or restrain an employer to
bargain about what the Act broadly characterises as management,
rights.

And management rights in this statute are defined to

include such subjects as discharge for cause, it includes
seniority

I'd like to get the language, because 1 think it

really reveals how unlike the NLRA and how oppressive this
is to us. We can't bargain about hirings, suspension, discharge
or transfer of employees,
QUESTION*

Yon don't suggest that that's unconstitu**

iional by itself?
MR* COHEN:

together amount to what I think is the tests

we're not saying that the California Act is constitutionally

mandated? we're saying that when you look at the inhibitions,
first on the speech to consumers, then on the access to
workers, ©ad speech to workers, we*re saying that it's

unconstitutional« That it falls below that, ground floor, under
which a State can’t experiment»

That’s what we’re saying»

I think that I’d like to sum up by saying, first,
that as to all the sections, I don’t think we need actual
enforcement as to ©aeh mid every section, to have a case or
controversy to allow this Court to examine those sections»
Those sections as to which we have actual enforcement happen
to be the most blatantly unconstitutional sections.

I think

that’s clear.
The threat ©f enforcement, we are in a much stronger
position than the doctor in Doe v. Bolton or the teacher in
Epperson or the vendor of real estate in L,inmarka
designed to hit our activity.

This is

Broadriek doesn’t apply here,

because these activities are speech activities within *»~ not
within tli© legitimate sweep of the statute, it’s not conduct»
8© I think that we have the right to ask that each and ©very
section be examined, not only under threat of prosecution but
because the criminal section makes this an overbroad criminal
statute.

Because each and every violation of every section of

this statute is a crime.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR® LSEs

Well, I appreciate that courtesy, Mr®

Chief Justics®
%

May I simply point out that most of my friend, Mr®
Cohen1 s argument has been directed to portions of "the statute
as to which there is no record, wars not presented in either
the questions presented in the Jurisdictional Statement nor
in the Motion t© Affirmo

There are no findings of fact®

Most of Mr® Cohen*® argument has been directed

Let m© turn, however, very briefly to those and give
my responses

S© I say that, a fortiori, this not being a

©as© or controversy as to those issues that the district
@©urt did decide, it certainly is not a ©as© ©r controversy
as to those issues that the district court did not decide, and

62
were not included as part of the questions presented in the
jurisdictional papers*
First# with regard to TRO's. This has been the
principal procedure objection that has been raised, all alonga
But let me isolate the issue very precisely.

1 agree with

Mr® Cohen that Rule 65 of th© Arizona Rules ©f Civil Procedure
is mad® a part of every one of those TRO proceedings„
Rule 65 of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure is
identical to the Federal Rules® There ara only two differences.

where th® other ©n@ says ^©r69®

there be temporary restraining orders without notice. Th©

Mow# there was

for the Servefeta holding»
Mr3 Cohen is very creative, and I'll grant you that
if you taka his interpretation ©£ that statute, that when you
say those ©ranges have been treated with dangerous pesticides,
don't buy them, that that raises serious First Amendment
questions? 1 couldn't agree more®
But X vigorously disagree that that's what that
statute means®

tod X think that for the first time in this

Court,, when it has never been considered by the lower court,
when there is no record on it, and when there is nothing any­
where in that Enforcement Stipulation that has even a hint of
that kind ©f enforcement of (B)(7), that this is the time to
be applying it®
tef with regard to (BJ(12) and this prohibition ©f
organisational activities after an election has been filed,
the real fear there «°* (B) C12) is simply a counterpart of
th© Fedoral Rule that says where you had an election, or
where a petition has been filed within 12 months, then further
picketing and organizational activity is prohibited®
The fear is that that will be used for an improper
purposee And X concede fully the possibility of its being
used for an improper purpose»

Just the earns as in Friedman

vs« Rogers.,- there was the possibility of an improper hearing
being held» But if it were used for that purpose, then it is
w&sy clear that under a combination of 1383 and 1385(A)

the manager of the store* talking about pesticides* are
illusory in this eas®, They depend again on hypothesis* on
speculation* and they are hypotheses and speculations with
which w© vigorously disagree.
Now* in that regard* look at Tree Fruits, There is
no question that in Tree Fruits* just as the amicus says*
this Court went to great lengths to construe that statuta in
such a way as to save it.

And it did so — in fact* in

MR® LEE 5

But Carroll said that you have to get. *■-»•=*

you have to give actual notice except when there's some kind
©£ compelling reason that you can't. That is the Rule 65 rule,
•f

so that Carroll in effect, in a First Amendment case, affirms
the Rule 65 approach.
'

There is nothing in this Appendix, nothing, or

anywhere in th© record, that indicates that in fact there was
any impropriety, any failure to observe Rule 65 or any failure
to attempt •***» there is simply nothing on it, as to what the
fasts in those cases were®
This is just not the case to be deciding th©
constitutionality of Rule 65, which is necessarily what you

have fc© decide.
QUESTION$

The problem, as I understand the burden

of Mr. Justice White's question, is*

how does the Supreme

Court of th© State really get to construe this statute?

As

long as it's on the books, it does have soma deterrent effect,
I suppose, on First Amendment protections.
MR. LEE g

I would think that in a case in which I

g© into court, I get a TRO against Mr. Cohen, and then he
immediately goes before the Arizona Supreme Court on a special

S7
writ, which that statute provides, and attempts to dissolve
it, because I violated his constitutional rights.

Mootness

capable of repetition yet evading remando

Of course, if you8r© right about case or

controversy, why, you probably couldn't get in the State

So I suppose before we get to abstention, we

have to rule against you ©si the case or controversy?
