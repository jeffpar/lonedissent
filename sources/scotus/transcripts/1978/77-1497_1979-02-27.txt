PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in Arkansas v. Sanders.
Mr, Purvis, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH Ha PURVIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PURVIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

I would like to reserve approximately

ten minutes of my time, if I might, at the end for rebuttal.
The issue here before

this Court is whether this

Court is going to extend its holding in United States v.
Chadwick so as to prevent law officers who are in the process
of conducting a valid automobile exception search from searching luggage which is found within the vehicle.
Now, it appears to me
is no question but that what we
search.

that from the facts here there
have here is an automobile

Digressing a little bit, this Court has held in

Carroll, in Jhadwiek and in other cases that it will recognize
an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant clause, where
there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains contra­
band and it is coupled or the situation is coupled with
exigent circumstances.
QUESTION:

What are the exigant circumstances here

that distinguishes it from Chadwick?
that, will you?

fou will tell us about

MR» PURVIS:

Mr a Justice* I think we are clearly

talking apples and oranges* and I think in Chadwick this Court
made it extremely plain* mentioning several times that it did
not deal with nor was it confronted with an automobile
exception search.

The automobile exception in Chadwick was

not raised in the Court of Appeals* nor was it brought before
this Court.

What you had there was a situation where the

officers had made the arrest and had seized a 200-pound
double-lock footlocker which was about to be placed into the
trunk of a parked car with its engine not running, with the
trunk open* but the search did not take place there.

It was

after the officers reduced both the defendant and the foot­
locker to their exclusive control and took both to the federal
building in Boston where they kept them for an hour and a
half before doing the search that led this Court I believe to
say in no stretch of the imagination can we see exigent
circumstances.
Here* on the other hand, we are faced with a search
— we are faced first of all with the defendant and a
confederate whose existence the officers did not know

until

they saw him meat up at the baggage area of the airport, these
individuals leave the baggage area of the Little Rock Airport,
which incidentally is immediately adjacent to the door where
the cabs are,, leave the baggage area* they climbed into a
taxicab* which is moving down one of the busiest thorofares

5
in town, away from the airport at 5:00 o'clock, in rush-hour
traffic, on Friday afternoon, after the courts have closed
for the weekend, to some point unknowns
QUESTION.”

General Purvis, if I understand your

theory correctly, in Chadwick you would say the automobile
exception would have applied if the agents had waited a few
moments until they put the footlocker into the trunk of the
ear and then started the motor, is that right?
MR. PURVIS:

I think it possibly would have, but I

think certainly when you are speaking of a 200-pound doublelocked footlocker —
QUESTION:

Well, it still would have fit into the

trunk, I think*
MR, PURVIS;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir*
And if they started the motor, it would

be precisely like this car*

And in your example about this

case, the car wasn't moving when they got in -- the taxi
wasn't moving when they put the suitcase into the taxi, was
it?
MR* PURVIS:
QUESTION:

What you had, Mr. Justice —
Isn't It a different point in time when

the officers chose t© make the search?

Isn’t that the only

difference?
MR, PURVIS:
QUESTION:

No, sir*
They could have, presumed they knew about

6
the description of the luggage when they put It in the trunk
here.

If they had grabbed it right before they put it in the

trunks then it would be exactly like Chadwick, wouldn’t It?
MR. PURVIS:

I don't think that there was any way,

Mr. Justice Stevens, that the officers here really could have
made the search and seizure at that time because of the par­
ticular facts of this situation.
Mr. Sanders.

Number one, they knew about

It was almost a Draper-like fact situation,

corroboration of an informant’s tip.

All right.

There was

no corroboration, no full corroboration until he picked up
the suitcase.

But then there was.
But Mr. Sanders then meets up with a

Suddenly the rise — 1 think the natural inference is9

wWells we may be dealing with a ring here, a conspiracy,
certainly more than one.”

All right.

Mr. Sanders very coolly

then goes out and gets Into the taxicab, while Mr. Rambo, the
eodefendant, stands there as the lookout for any officers
that might move in, then picks the suitcase up and away they
go.

Now, also ~

where the officers were <—

7
QUESTION:

Could they not have picked the — have

seized the suitcase when he picked It up, at the moment you
just described?
MR. PURVIS:

I think also the officers were far

enough away physically that they probably could not have
gotten to him»

Mr. Sanders would have driven away in the

taxicab had the officers moved in, and there is also the
possibility that the officers could not have gotten to Mr»
Rambo before he got into the taxicab.

There is also the

possibility that he might have had a weapon and in an airport
gun play could have ensued»
QUESTION:

Mr, Purvis, the facts you’ve described

sort of make this sound, like a much more kind of fluid situ­
ation and not the classical automobile search exception when
you’ve got a taxi»
MR. PURVIS:

Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, I don’t think

the fact that it is a taxicab as opposed to an individual
private

vehicle, I don’t see anything in the automobile re­

quirement that says we will grant an automobile exception as
to taxicabs but — or as to private vehicles, but we won’t as
to taxicabs,

I think the same factors, the same two basic

criteria that allow the warrantless automobile search are
applicable in this situation here»

I think they are present.

I think there is certainly the probabis cause to believe that
the taxicab contains contraband, and I think given that, given

-

8

the situation you have , the fact that there are certainly
exigent circumstancese
Now, the officers I believe testified in the hear­
ing , in the pretrail suppression hearing that the Little Rock
Airport is rather uniquely situated in that there is an
observation deck up here (indicating), there la a baggage
area here (indicating), and here (indicating) is the door,out
of which the — the officers apparently were up here on the
observation deck watching all of this»
QUESTION

Why wouldn’t — I can see how that might

give them probable cause to seise the suitcase, but how about
searching it and opening it right on the spot —
MR» PURVIS:

I think you have exactly the same thing

and arguably a lesser intrusion into the privacy of the owner
of the goods and the owner of the vehicle and what not than
you would in a Carroll case, because —
QUESTION:

How do you think a search of the vehicle

which is a taxicab, when you are searching a bag which the
taxi company doesn’t own, the taxi driver doesn’t own — you
were searching the suitcase«
MR, PURVIS:

You were searching the suitcase, but it

is an integral part, there is no -»
QUESTION:

Does the respondent complain about the

searching of the cab?
MR* PURVIS:

Does the respondent?

9
QUESTION:

Yes.

Nos he doesn’t complaint about it

at all9 does he?
MRo PURVIS:
QUESTION;

Apparently he does not, nos sir*,
Wells why do you keep saying that they

had a right to search the cab?
MR. PURVIS:

Because if you want to take the crux

of the argument further and essentially what the issue Is
here, we do not think that Chadwick applies to restrict
officers who are making a legitimate automobile exception
search,
QUESTION:

Do you think they can search everything

in it and open it up?
MR. PURVIS;

I think certainly that they have a

right toa at —»
QUESTION:
MR, PURVIS:

Including a double-locked locker?
I would question as to a distinction

of the right of privacy between an individual as to the con­
tents of his actual seats of the car9 as in Carroll0

If there was a double-locked trunk in a

MR, PURVIS;
QUESTION:

I think possibly you could.
By opening the locks9 breaking the

locks?

You just ignore it?

I don’t have to ask you which is apples

and which is oranges.

has also got to be remembered here9 the officers did .not —
there were not separate perky»jerky instances.

The officers

did not atop the individuals and then they did not place them
under arrest9 and then they did not sei^e the suitcase and
take it out and do a search.

The officers stopped the eabs

with the aid of another car finally,, in rush-hour traffic,
got the individuals out and immediately asked the cab driver
If he would open the trunk of the ear, the suitcase was still
in the trunk of the ears the suitcase was immediately popped
op@n8 they saw that it contained marihuana, they closed it up

11
and put the Individuals under arrest and confiscated the
suitcase and down to the station they went»
QUESTION:

You said popped open, of Its own voli­

tion?
MR« PURVIS:

No, I said they — popped is a rather

colloquial term —» X*m sorry I used that*
QUESTION:
MR, PURVIS:

I just wanted to be certain,,
Rut they opened the suitcase.

Apart

from there, Mr. Justice Marshall defined exigent circumstances
in his dissent in United States v. Watson, saying that where
law enforcement officers have probable causa to believe that
an offense Is taking place in their presence and that the
suspect is at that moment in possession of the evidence, then
exigent circumstances exist®
Now, there is no question but that they had probable
cause to believe that that suitcase and the defendant here
was In possession, was committing an offense and did have the
................................ . . ... . . . . • . . . .
evidence within his possession, and I don't think Chadwick
and indeed I don't know of any case that says, as respondent
would have this Court believe, that upon stopping this
vehicle ae they were authorized to do, that exigent circum­
stances somehow flitter away like butterflies or moths in the
morning light®

I just do not think that that happens.

In fact, in looking at the facts in Carroll where
the search was conducted after they had stopped Mr® Carroll's

12
automobile some fifteen miles away from Grand Rapids, In the
Chambers ease, where the search was done at the police
station after they had brought the vehicle back.

This leads

to a -QUESTION:

Mr. Purvis, is It your submission that

there is probably cause not only to search but at the time
that there was probable cause to arrest the occupants of the
cab?
MR, PURVIS:

fasg sir8 and I think there was prob­

able cause to arrest on a suspicion and 1 think when the
officers observed the contents of that suitcases x^hleh 1
think under the circumstances of this particular eases was a
very minimal or probably a far minimal privacy intrusion
than it would have been to have arrested the cab driver and
the fcxfo occupants thereof and have driven all of them down t©
the police station and waited at least two hours while some
j

magistrate was hunted up and a warrant was obtained.
-

QUESTION:
MR. PURVIS:

And where was the suitcase in the cab?
The suitcase was in the trunk of the

cab.
QUESTION:

In the trunk.

So under Chime1 it is

doubtful whether this would have been —
MR. PURVIS:

Yes, sir, and we tried —

QUESTION:

I was thinking about the Rios case, which

Involved a taxicab.

I don’t know if you are familiar with it9

13
364 U.S.

It involved the stop of a taxicab.
MR, PURVIS:

I must confess that I am not thoroughly

familiar with it»
QUESTION:

Mr® Purvis, let me go back to a question

that the Chief Justice asked you about what were the exigent
circumstances.

At the end of the Supreme Court of Arkansas’s

opinion, they say with the suitcase safely immobilized, there
was no risk that the evidence might be lost®

What were the

exigent circumstances?
MR. EJURVXS:

As I reiterated before — and let me

preface this, Mr® Justice Stevens, with the remarks that it
seems to me quite obvious that th© Arkansas Supreme Court was
so bound and determined to fit th© facts of this ease within
the ambit of Chadwick that it did everything it could,, includ­
ing inventing and misconstruing argument on behalf of th©
state to try to shoehorn the facts within that ease.
QUESTION:

That may b@9 but I didn't really hear

your answer to th© Chief Justice's question and I haven’t
heard you address my question.
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. PURVIS:

1 think ~
What were the exigent circumstances?
I think, sir, that th© exigent circum­

stances were that you had a defendant and a just met confeder­
ate who are in a moving vehicle» who are moving away from the
airport5 In rush-hour traffic, at 5s00 o’clock, on e. Friday

MR. PURVIS;

I think, Mr. Justice Marshall, that

under the facts here9 where you have as we contend a legiti­
mate automobile search, that given the language of Chambers
vs Maroney, there is no constitutional difference between a
search9 a warrantless search at the scene and taking th©
individuals all back to the police station.

But why couldn’t you have gotten a

Do you think the automobile ex-

e@ption9 as you call it, rests on some assessment of the

Do you think you can get into a looked

MR® PURVIS:

Yesg sir, and I think to hold -anything

ridden on many buses in my lifetime with people iirho were too

have officers who are afraid and will not do a search of the
vehicle, of any sack* bag, and what not0
QUESTION:

General Purvis, ar@n8t there really two

kinds of situations that might possibly call for different
rules?

One is if you have probable cause to believe some­

where in a vehicle* maybe in language* maybe in the trunk*
maybe in the glove compartment* there is contraband, and
another ease where you have probable cause to believe it is
in a specific piece ©f luggage* and you know there is
nothing else In the taxicab®

Do you think you apply the

same rule to both of those eases?
MR. PURVIS:

Yes* sir* I think you can because I

think to do otherwise, you tend to focus the Fourth Amend­
ment away from the right of privacy and toward places and
things 9
QUESTION:

Well* what if there has been a piano

stolen and you stop a truck and you want to search and see if
the truck has got the piano on it.

Do you think you can

search the glove compartment?
MR0 PURVIS:

I think for anyone to expect that a

piano would be stuffed In a glove compartment x^ould be rather
ludicrous.
QUESTION:

So your answer is no or not?

could call incident to the arrest?
MR. PURVIS;

I think you could really proceed under

either theory.
QUESTIONS

Well* do you think if you simply had

probable cause t© stop a vehicle because you had reason to
believe that a suspect was in the vehicle, without any addi­
tional evidence, you could search the trunk, get out a suit­
case and search the suitcase —
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION;

fee, sir,
although perhaps the person that you

had probable cause to arrest was thought to be fleeing, a
suspect and had connection with the suitcase?
MR* PURVIS;

I certainly think you can, and I think

that situation, Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, is extremely analogous
to the situation in Chambers, where the officers had probable
cause to believe that that vehicle contained four men who fit
the description of the robbers of a store, and that was the
reason that they stopped0

And once given that valid auto

exception search, I think it allowed them or deemed reasonable
the search of the entire vehicle.

MR. PURVIS:

It seems to me, toe, something to be

remembered here is that this Court has also repeatedly held
that those who occupy an automobile moving on the highways
operate under a diminished expectation of privacy®

And to

hold that it is the automobile Itself which enjoys that
diminished expectation of privacy I think is frivolous.

tainly there is no such thing as an inanimate object that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK Tc LASSITER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR® LASSITER:
the Court:

Mr® Chief Justice, and may It please

I am Jack Lassiter, court-appointed attorney for

the respondent, Mr.. Sanders.
What d© we do with the suitcase in the trunk of the
cab?

Before I start in here, let me say that it is simply

the respondent*s position that we have no exigent circum­
stances hers, once the cab is stopped, once Mr® Sanders is
arrested along with his cohort, Mr. Rambo, and the suitcase
is seized®

1 can’t think of what possible exigency then

existent,
Whether Mr. Sanders was placed in the rear of the
police car or he was handcuffed outside the police car prior
to the entry into the trunk of the cafe, I think in either
situation any exigency ceased at that point0
QUESTION;

At what point?

MR, LASSITER;

When the cab Is stopped and Mr,

Sanders is placed under arrest, and then the trunk is opened
and the suitcase itself Is seised, removed from the trunk of
the cab.
QUESTION;

Why could they get into the trunk?

MR. LASSITER;

Well, I have not argued that they

didn’t have probable cause to open the trunk and seise the
suitcase itself, just that they could not then enter the
suitcase without prior judicial authorisation.
QUESTION;

Well, assume there is probable ~ let’s

just assume there is probable cause to believe that there was
contraband or something in the suitcase.

that it was his suitcase in the trunk of the ear and the

There is a distinction that the Attorney General
raises or attempts to raise based on Chambers in which he
addresses language therein that speaks of the lesser and

The argument there

was that once the ear is seised, the subsequent entry into
the automobile! later on Is just simply a lesser intrusion
from the greater intrusion into the constitutionally pro­
tected area of seising the automobile®
It would seem to me that that analysis was abandoned
in Chadwick, in a footnote written by Mr. Chief Justice
Burger, In which -he points out that there is a distinction
between the proprietary property

interest in the object, be

it a car or a suitcase, which is something entirely different
from the individual’s privacy expectation in the contents

■ ;

cause to believe he had stolen a piano would not?

I mean,

doesn’t It depend a little bit ©n the kind of offense that
you ar© talking about?

*58
MR. LASSITER:

Yes, certainly*

In your hypothetical.,

if we believe that a murder has been accomplished with a „*15
automatic by this individuals he is seen running from the
scenea ft® i‘3 arrested soon thereafter with the briefcase, I
believe perhaps we could get the warrant for entering the
briefcase to look for the automatic.
QUESTION:

What you are saying is that the term

"reasonable" in the Fourth Amendment means reasonable under
all the circumstances of the particular case., with all the
nuances that may occur in the variations?
MR® LASSITER:

And hopefully with as well defined

rules as we can possibly create to give It some predictability
in the situation.
QUESTION:

V'

No ofie has been able to determine them

very well up to now®
MR. LASSITER:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

N© one has been able to define them

precisely up to now.
MR® LASSITER:

It Is a very difficult problem, Your

Honor.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Lassiter®

Do you have anything further, Mr* Purvis?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH: H. PURVIS, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. PURVIS:

Just a very few remarks. Your Honor®

First, contrary to Mr. Lassiter, 1 think again let
me reiterate what we have here .is not necessarily an arrest
prior to seizure and all of this, but we have one rather
rapid smooth-flowing set of circumstances and it seems clear
to me at least that the search of the suitcase was clearly
justifiable under the automobile exception»

In fast, it was

part and parcel and didn't constitute the search of the
automobile itself.
To hold that there were no exigent circumstances
present merely when the officers stopped them would be,
number on®, it seems to me, to deny the smooth-flowing facts
of the case and of the search which was highly contemporaneous
to the stopping; and, two, to say that they have evaporated
in that sort of situation makes it rather impossible to have
exigent circumstances present in any situation where you
have stopped any automobile0
We use the rather far-fetched analogy in our brief
that in order to follow this particular log, you would have
to have someone make a John Wayne-stype leap from one mewing
vehicle into another and to conduct the search while the
vehicle was still movings and I don't think that this Court
nor any court nor any human being with a whit of common
sense would say that that would be required»

It goes simply

to the point that exigent circumstances once present don't
quickly evaporate merely because the police have stopped the

50
Individual.
QUESTION;

Mr. Purvis„ would it be the same case if

instead of getting in a taxicab they got on a bus or a subway?
MRs, FURVIS:

I frankly don’t know, Your Honor, be­

cause I am not aware of an extension of the automobile excep­
tion to any such large common carrier.
QUESTION:

Don't you think there is a difference

between a common carrier and a private car?
MR. PURVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes„ sir, to a certain extent I do.
A common carrier might be a taxi which

you have commandeered exclusively or you might share it with
two other passengers or it might be a bus in which you would
share it with fifty or a hundred.
MR* PURVIS:

1 think that of all the common carriers

of which 1 knowa that the taxicab probably is intended to be
a repository of the fewer number of people.

You generally

have anywhere from one to four people who obtain a taxicab as
opposed to an airplane or a bus where you may have fifty,
sixty or hundreds.

And it seems also to me that if you say*

as Mr. Lassiter does* well, yoii can conduct a valid search of
this automobiles but you can't — or seizure of the suitcases
but you can't do a search because of the privacy right, then
you are saying that given a diminished expectation of privacy
in the vehicle,, that you are going to place then your truck
entirely ©n the place or the thing in which that alleged

51
privacy right was focused, namely a suitcase or a piece of
luggage, and I think it is the right of privacy overall and
I think given one v?ho Is in an automobile, that it Is his
expectation of privacy over the contents of the automobile,
his possessions In the automobile that are reduced.
Also going back to I think you are confronted again,
if you follow Mr. Lassiter’s logic, with a definition of what
is luggage.

And I will agree with Jack that one of the

primary focuses is to com© to some sort of predictability,
because all law enforcement people would like this and people
on both sides of the fence, and it seems to me that if you
say that we are going t© create an exemption of the automo­
bile exception or carve out an exception within it for
luggage or repositories of private effects, that you are
engaging in a never-ending battle, a never-ending definition
because what may be trash to me might be someone else’s
luggage*

And you can battle this out forever*
Finally, I think, too, the one key thing to remember

is the question that needs to be answered here, was was this
search of the suitcase reasonable under the circumstances.
And given the exigent circumstances which 1' have previously
stated, which I earnestly feel existed, that Justified the
stopping, I think with the expectation of privacy, I think
It was only reasonable for those officers to open up that
suitcase and look inside it„

Had they found nothing,

52
obviously, Mr. Sanders and his defendant would have been
allowed to go on their way0

And 1 think it is exactly this

situation that this Court referred to in its opinion in
Chambers, that given the valid auto exception there is no
constitutional difference, in fact It my very well be the
Court held implicitly a lesser intrusion of the right of
privacy t© allow that immediate warrantless search on the
scene as opposed to taking the individuals back and waiting
several hours upon the obtaining of a warrant.
QUESTION;

As a practical matter, If there had

bean nothing incriminatory inside that suitcase, the
respondents would have consented to the search and you
wouidn3t have had any subsequent problem.
MRo PURVIS:

Certainly, which leads to another

problem
QUESTIONS

MRo PURVIS:
and that is consent.
have consented to it.

And there wouldn't have been any delay.
~ which leads to another problem,, too,
It ie very easy to say, well, he could
However, I am sure Mr. Lassiter, as a

trial lawyer, vary well knows the problem of consent at the
time of the search and proving consent at the time of trial
or at the appellate lev©!

are two different things„

Very

often, the Arkansas Supreme Court has rejected twice in the
past three weeks consent searches where there was testimony
of two officers and. Indeed, a consent form signed where the

53
lower courts found that there was valid consent and the
Arkansas court held, well, be cause it was a situation where
there were three officers in uniform, with guns, and one
defendant or two defendants, there was the natural coercion
there, and we just cannot believe that this was a valid con­
sent .
QUESTION?

Was your court unanimous in those cases?

MR. PURVISs

fes9 sir, they were.

It was by a

four-member panel9 and all four members were unanimous*

We

have filed for petitions for rehearing*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted*
(Whereupon, at 11:58 o'clock a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
