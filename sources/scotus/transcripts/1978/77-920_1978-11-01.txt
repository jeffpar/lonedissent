MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No» 920, Thor Power Tool Company against
Commission of Internal Revenue.
M:c. Berens# you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK H. BEPENS P ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BERENS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court %
This case presents two issues under the Internal
Revenue Code;

evaluation of excess inventory? and the calcula­

tion of bad debts by the reserve method formula.
Both issues, which are separata, seem to be of high
frequency and inspire a considerable amount of feeling among
the. taxpayers involved.
The principal one involves evaluation of excess
inventory.
QUESTION ;

I suppose it might be accurately added

that they present infinite variations, is that not so?
MR. BERENS;

They certainly do# Mr, Chief Justice.

The excess inventory i3sue is really a question of
timing.

When may inventory that a taxpayer reasonably deter­

mines to be in excess of foreseeable demands# when may it be
written down? at the time he makes this determination or later
when it is eventually scrapped# as the Commissioner contends?

4
The importance of this issue, I think, is indicated
by the filing of very thoughtful amicus briefs by the United
States Chamber o£ Commerce and the National Association of
Manufacturers.

The issue affects all manufacturers on the

lower of the cost or market method, as well as wholesalers raid
dealers who stock replacement parts.

This includes the auto*»

motive industry, farm equipment, machinery, electronics,
electrical equipment of ail sorts.
And good sound business sense requires these
manufacturers and dealers to stock or really overstock «pair©
parts if they are to serve their customers.
©re first produced, it is very difficult,

When the parts
and sometimes

impossible, to predict exactly how much demand on a part,
based on its wearing ability, breakage, et cetera.

And so they

nr? intentionally overproduced by most manufacturers.
After 'the part has been in use, after its main product

has been in use for a while, it becomes evident that the part
.is overstocked.

And at this time generally accepted accounting

principles require that the excess part, the excess quantity
ba marked down to net realisable value.

And it is this

requirement, to clearly reflect financial accounting income,
that we submit should be parallelly determinate of taxable
income.
QUESTION $ Did your client dispose of these excess
parts at any time, Mr. Borens?

5
MR. BEREUS;
QUESTION?
MR. BEKENS t

in the meantime, did you say?
At any time.
The excess parts in issue, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, for '64 were 78 percent and were disposed of by 1971.
QUESTION:
MR. BERENS:
exact tracing.

Disposed of in what way?
By scrapping.

And this was by an

Exhibit 17, I believe,, shows that.

I am going to dwell a little bit on the facts here,
perhaps a little more than I should, to get the proper
perspective, because while the facts are not in dispute, the
parties interpret them quite differently.
At the end of 1964, Thor's new management determined
that its inventory was greatly overvalued.

After making a

number of specific writedowns, it was confronted with the fact
that it had 44,non different items zf. inventory, which
comprised millions of pieces.

Most of these, 33,000 different

items, were replacement parts and accessories.

And they were

held, for the most part, in quantities greatly exceeding
£oreceaabls demand.
It: was impractical to value these individually,? and
so management developed two procedures, statistically sound,
fairly common-place among manufacturers at the time, to writedown or tc determine how much should be ’written down.
The primary procedure was to compare on an iteia-byiterni basis the quantities on hand with the actual sales Thor

6
had mada during 1964 or the production usage of the parts.
And 2 stress it©ffi~by*”item«

If there were no sales or use of

that item, they were written off as obsoleta, a writeoff that
the Commissioner accepted.
amount at hand

If there was some usage but the

exceeded two years’ usage, then 'that portion in

excess of two years was written off.

Amounts between on© and

two years were partially written off.
At soma locations of Thor there was inadequate data
on usage for the preceding year and so additional, not
substitute but additional, percentage writedowns were done for
a limited number of limited categories of goods.
Thor’s president testified that the writedowns were
solely intended to accurately reflect current inventory value,
at the end of 1964.

He stated that income tax affects were not

even considered at the time.

Th® Tax Court, based on his

testimony and that of several accounting experts, found three
specific things?
That Thor’s procedures for writing down the inventory
— and I’m quoting —"wrote down the inventory in issue to its
estimate of current net realizable value.55

And I stress

"current net realizable value”.
The Court also found that this v?as required by
generally accepted accounting principles i and*, it further found
that this constituted a "best accounting practice" within the
meaning of Section 471 of the Code, to which I’ll return.

7
Tha findings of the Court, which were not disputed
by the Court of Appeals nor by the Commissioner, were fully
supported by the testimony of six expert accountants, five of
whom were preeminent in 'the field of accountancy.

They

testified that generally accepted accounting principles required
the excess inventory to be written down, to clearly reflect
financial income.

They stated that the us® of a formula of

this sort was essential as a practical matter, and it was
commonplace„
They specifically testified that both procedures
that is, the formula and the percentage,supplementary
percentage writedowns -*»

conformed to generally accepted

accounting principles.

They testified that the writedown was

reasonable in amount.

And this was based on a hindsight basis,

including the degree of scrapping.
And finally they testified that they would have
withheld certification at the end of ’64 had Thor not written
down the inventory as it had.
They further testified that if Thor had not written
it down but had waited until it was scrapped to writ® it down,
financial income would have been distorted both in 1964 and
in the later year or years whan it was scrapped.
I want to stress that the testimony and the finding?;
of the Court stated that this was an estimated current loss in
existence at tha end of 1964; it was not a provision for a

8
future less,
Now# throughout respondent's brief the writedown is
characterized as an anticipation of or a reserve for a future
loss.

‘This» %/e submit# is contrary to the record.
Thor’s writedown is authorized# we submit# by two

sections of the Code.

Section. 446, which basically provides

that taxable income shall be computed under a method of
accounting

the taxpayer uses in keeping his books# provided it

clearly reflects income.

But more directly governing is

Section 471# which is the key section on inventory accounting.
It imposes two conjunctive requirements binding on both the
taxpayer and the Commissioner, that inventory accounting must
conform,first, as nearly as may be to the bast accounting
practice in the trade or business and, secondly# as most
clearly reflecting the income.
Now, the Tax Court found that Thor mat the first
requirement, conformance to the best accounting practice.
•The testimony of the experts, which said that if Thor had
waited to scrap it, it would not have conformed to a best
j

accounting practice, means that, the Commissioner’s scrapping
method cannot meet the first requirement of Section 471.

It

cannot be a best accounting practice.
This —
QUESTIONg

May I ask this one question?

twice used the phrase# "a best accounting practice”.

You have
I take it

9

it's understood that there is not a single best accounting
practice?
i

MR. BE HENS s

No* Mr. Justice Stevens,

aware of that from the Van Picker!,1,1 decision.

And I'm quite
There may be

more than one best accounting practice,
QUESTIONs

It's an unusual use of the word "best",

but it really means an acceptable or ~~
MR, BE HENS %

Yes.

Tine statute actually says "the",

but I think it is normally read as meaning "a'% and I sometimes
use them interchangeably,
QUESTION: Right,
MR, KERENSt
QUESTION8

But I agree with you,
I just wanted to be sure I wasn't mis°

undersfcandiag it.
MR. KERENSs

The question then resolves:

Did Thor's

method clearly reflect income under both Section 4-45 and 471?
And we believe the test undor both is identical.
Perhaps the best way of getting at that troublesome
question is to relate the two methods to each other.

And it

seems u fair way of approaching it because there seems to be
so other logical point of tiros when the writedown could occur
than one or the other of these, the one side when th© taxpayer
reasonably determines it should be written down, or later when
it's scrapped,

I cannot think of any other point of time

that could be used as the test.

10

Now, from this viewpoint, perhaps the bast way of
approaching is to look at the Coranissloner9 a scrapping method»
Does it clearly reflect income?
Now, from a financial accounting viewpoint it doesn't.
It was established» But beyond that, the Commissioner basically
contends that to clearly reflect income you should overstate
your inventory’ by not writing unsalable goods down to their
net realisable value, and that you should hold this overstate­
ment in the inventory for a year or two or more until, whenever
you eventually scrap it.
Now, the layman would not view an overstatement of
inventory to clearly reflect income, because the higher the
inventory is stated the higher the income is reported»
i»

The Commissioner's view makes an assumption hare,
not only that it was a future loss, but tied in that, and if is
in both the lower court's opinions and in the brief of the
respondent, is that inventory losses do not occur

until they

are realized»
Now, we submit — and 1 use a strong word
is a radica.■. argument»

that this

It has never, to our research been

advanced in some sixty years»

The administrative history,

outlined at length in our reply brief, is completely to the
contrary, starting with T»B.R» 48 issued in around 1919.
Thera era no eases that hold realization of losses of inventory
are required for *»- and I should emphasize — for a taxpayer

that is & differant method. And in particular I cits the
discussion in Space Controls, 322 Fed at 147 and 48,which
outlines the history of the realization issue in inventory
accounting.
QUESTION:

What do you — you say the taxpayer writes

the inventory down to net realisable cost?
MR. BERENSs
QUESTIONS
going to get to that?

Yes, Mr. Justice.
What is net realizable cost?

Are you

Is that different than what ha thinks

the scrap value would be?
MR. BERENSs

No, in Thor's case It was specifically

an estimate of scrap value.
QUESTION s

tod why is the inventory held rather

than acrappod at that time?
JiRo BERENSs

Because, on an individual item basis,

Mr. Justice White, *»*»
QUESTION*
MR. BERENSs

You can make a mistake.
— it is unknown.

It is clear that

Thor may have underestimated one of the 44,000 items and over­
estimated the others.
QUESTION* Do you have some experience in that regard,
as to what percentage of tb.® inventory Thor would like to
write down that later proves to be salable, and that it has
a value?

12
MR. BEHENS s

In 1970, when Arthur Andersen was first

engaged as Thor’s accountant “*» this is frosts the record — they
did a "first-time-through** special test of the inventory write­
down of this excess system.

And they found — for using the

exact system that the company used and doing very extensive
sampling, they found in 1970 that the writedown ~ I’m not
speaking of *64 now? but in 1370 it was about, if I recall
correctly, about five percent too low? and in 1971, it ~
QUESTION: So five percent of the items were taken
back info ordinary sales, is that it?
MR. KERENSt

That they should have written off more

then they did.
QUESTIONs
MR. KERENS *

Oh, I sea.
That the writedown was too little —

I know it’s misleading there — too little. And again in '71
it was too little by a larger degree.
In other words, Thor’s formula was on the conservative
side.
The testimony of Mr. BeIda -*=
QUESTION;

But, nevertheless, even so there would

have been isolated or recurring instances of inventory that
was written down that nevertheless was sold?

MR. KERENS s

Absolutely. Absolutely.

And at that .

time, to the extent that it was sold, that had already been
written down, the taxable income in the later year would have

been Increased
QUESTION?

By the difference between the ***« its

net realisable value and the sales price?
MR* BERENSs
QUESTION?

Yes*

Yes.

Things are segregated so you know which

inventory you are —MR* BEHENSs

No# they are not segregated, and I

volunteer the observation that, while it

w&b

stated in both

lower court;;!’ opinions, neither cited any authority for it,
for segregation? and w© could find none.
QUESTION3 Well, what happens if an item that’s been
written down is sold at the same

at what if used to b© sold

for, how do you *»« do you just put that amount in your gross
income?
MR. BERENSs

Yes, Your Honor, that’s exactly what is

done*
Let me stress that this is a statistical system for
which — where any particular item may not work.

In fact,

I’ll go so far as to say it'a unlikely to be accurate, and
that’s the vary need for it, because it can’t, be accurate for
one item.

It is accurate because there’s 44,000 items.
An all of th© experts testified, a formula system

1'k. this it statistically sound, if it’s properly conceived*
And while every item could be wrong, in the aggregate it is
right.

14
And I’d like to analogize here to the retail sales
method, where the same problem exists for a department storev
where there are sometimes hundreds of thousands of items priced
at retail value, and when they take inventory they use average
markup

formulas in reverse to mark them down to cost.

exactly the same statistical system

This is

and I should interrupt

myself to say that that is specifically approved by the retail
sales method regulation? that this is the same statistical
premises upon which the writedown by Thor is based.
Mow, I also stress that even on an over-all statisti­
cal basis it is not accurate.
perfectly accurate«

We do not contend it is

But I harken to the Cohan rule promulgated

by Judge Learned Hand in 1930, where he said?

most important

things can’t be exactly accurata and that the tax law has to
be practical, and as long as it is reasonably accurate, this
is all that the law requires.
QUESTION? Wall, ultimately your writedown is going
to be adjusted, isn't it?
ME. KERENS?

It’s going to be adjusted —

QUESTION? When you scrap it, when you scrap it?
MR. BEHRENSs

Or when it’s eventually all sold.

Say that you completely —
QUESTIONs

Yes, but suppose it’s scrapped and

suppose you get out of it more than you thought you would?
Mho BEPENS:

Then that’s adjusted, too.

The scrapping

15
revenues go into gross income.
QUESTIONs And if yon get less* what about that?
MR. BERENSs Then you

through the writeoff system

you get an additional loss at that time.
QUESTION t

So eventually things turn out accurately?

MR. BEHENSs

It rolls through* but I’d like to

stress* Mr. Justice White* both when it’s scrapped and when it
is sold* either disposal eventually catches up.
Q?JE5STI0N;

Mr. Bsrens* your time is going on* but

sometime before you sit down* you have a response to the argument
that fcha inventory evaluation procedure was a change in
accounting methodj the government makes this* and I'd like to
get your response to it.
At your convenience* just before you sit down..
MR. BE REMS:

Yes.

I suppose -*-■ would you prefer*

Mr. Justice Blackmun, to give if now?

I was going to save it

f or rebuttal time * but I'd be glad to respond.
QUESTIONj

All right* just so you catch it at .some

time.
MR. BEHENSs

Maybe I better* in case I lose my

rebuttal time.
We submit that this is — and again I use a strong
term “•» a non-issue* in reality.

Apart from

the fact that the

Commissioner had the burden of proof* and we do not believe
he met that burden.

There ara three requirements for a change

16
of accounting method within the meaning of 446(e) of the Code *
And the principal one is that income escapes tax because of the
change, or that there is a double deduction or, in this case, a
double increase in cost of goods soldo

And either actually or

potentially»
And as we explain at length in our reply brief, there
is no possibility, by Thor’s procedures, that any income could
have escaped or had double reduction.
We secondly point out that change of method is a
specific tern meaning a change of the basis of valuation which
was — lower-’of-cost-or-market

~ which was not changed.

Or a change in a inventory method such as from FIFO to LIFO or
to change a cost accounting method, which Thor also did not
change.

It does not reach down into the component techniques

of calculation within the basis evaluation, and within the
method used.
Also in 1964 the regulations made this clear, and as
»?e point out in the brief, it was only the later amendments of
1970 where the regulations stretched, we believe, the statutory
standard to try to define change of method to include a change
of a component of the method.

And we do not believe that, as

-e raid in or.r brief, that that regulation applies to 1964?
.ad, in face, we argue that it goes beyond the statutory
intention.
0 JESTXOM; Are you saying that the taxpayer has used

17
consistently the lower^cost-or-raarket method for valuing
inventories?
MR. BERENSs

Yes. And the record is clear on that*.

Mr. Justice Paws11.
QUESTIONs All right. And when you use the term "net
realisable value”* that's not inconsistent with th© cost-ormarket method?
MR. KERENS %

As we conceive it, based on generally

accepted accounting principles* it is part of the lower-cost»
or-market system.

It does not meet the specific requirements

of — or* an interpreted by the Commissioner* of the market
regulations* of the market regulations* th© lower-cost-ormarket.
We — I misstated that. The Commissioner argues it
does not meat the definitions within the lower-cost-or-markefc
method ©f th© regulations.

As our brief points out* we submit

that it's there interpreted to fulfill the statutory intent.
That is* to constitute a bast accounting practice* that they
do authorise this type of writedown.
QUESTION%

1 want to be sure* incidentally* Mr.

Berens* do 1 correctly understand that you are not attacking
specifically any of th© regulations involved here?
MR. BERENSs

No* Mr. Justice Blaekmun*. we cannot

attack them because they're an omission.
explicitly with the problem.

They don’t deal

We say this application* if

10

they are interpreted to preclude this type of writedown, we
object to that/ but we do not aay that any provision of the
regulations is invalid.,
QUESTION*

tod I stress because it

But you say —» you just talked about an

interpretation of the regulation with which you disagree,
MR. BEHENSs

Yes. The Commissioner's interpretation

of the regulations^ we believe is improper* but the regulations
are not invalid.

They are basically silent on the writedown

of —»
QUESTION%

But you think his interpretation of that

particular regulation is contrary to the statute?
MR. B3RENS%

Yes.

QUESTIONS

Yes.

QUESTION?

I'm sorry, you say you took the regula­

tion was or was not contrary to the statute?
MR. BE HENS s

No, feh© regulation *»*» you express it in

a different way, Mr. Justice Stevens, and makes it a hard —
I’ll have to answer it a little differently.

The regulation,

as far as it goes, is not contrary to the statute. The
regulation, wo concede, is silent on the writedown of excess
inventory,
QUESTIONs
it allowed the

Well, is 1471.4 silent on it?

I thought

writedown of excess inventory if there was an

extraordinary circumstance that produced the excess. And I
thought you then argued about whether or not there was an

IS
extraordinary circumstance in the Tax Court»
MR» BEREMS2

W® never argued that there was an

extraordinary circumstance. That was from the Tax Court’s
opinion» We argued, and we argue here, and I have not stated
this very well, that if you — that the language of »4, dealing
with the writedown of market, construed broadly, where it says
if normal conditions of the market do not exist, that you may
us® the best available evidence.

Wa say that that cavers

excess inventory, while, at the same time, conceding that
excess inventory is not specifically provided for by name
in that regulation.
We also paralielly argue that under the ~*»
QUESTIONg Well, let me stay with that for
moment.

just a

I guess I was wrong in using the word '’extraordinary'5.

It‘s where there are abnormal market circumstances on some
items like this.,
MR. BERENSs

Yes.

Yes.

QUESTIONS And do you contend that the existence of
an excess inventory is evidence ~ do you contend there were
abnormal market, circumstances in your case?
MR. BERENS s

We contend that there is inherent

abnormality in the market for replacement parts.

That there’s

not a normal pricing effect of supply and demand, as was
testified both by Mr. ~~
QUESTION s

But the answer the Court of Appeals gave,

20

as 1 remember, was that you regularly produce an excess because
this is the normal way you do business»

But that, nevertheless,

is abnormal?
MR. BEHENSs

The market does not operate in the

normal way for replacement parts. We think the Court of
Appeals is misapplying this concept in that point. The regular
goods, you can move them, if they are slow moving, by lowering
the price.

With replacement parts, there is essentially no

elasticity on them, you cannot lower the price and move them.
So, although you produced them intentionally, you still ~ if
you could be perfect, you would produce exactly the right
amount that's eventually needed, but you can't be? and so you
produce intentionally the excess.
That production side is not what makes it extra-»
ordinary.

What makes it ~~ I don’t want to use the word

3extraordinary"

what makes it an unnormal situation is the

nature of the goods, the replacement parts.
QUESTIONs Wouldn’t your reasoning apply to any goods
which a manufacturer makes expecting not to be able to sell
100 percent of his production?
MR. BEPENS s

I would say it would, and it certainly

would apply to the retailer who buys quantities of goods, some
of which he knows are going to turn out to be obsolete and
unsalable? which ones he doesn’t

know.

But the lower-of-cost«

or-market system is designed to handle that situation.

21
Two of the important decisions of this Court in the
area of tax accounting, Kansas City Structural Steel, which
condemned — one of thorn being Kansas City Structural Steel,
which condemned the taxpayer's base document, that because it
misrepresented the facts it merged the inventory results of
one year with that of another,,

That method is designed to do

that ,
Really, that objection that this Court found to that
method, we think applies to the scrapping method.

It delays

recognizing a loss that has occurred to some year after it has
really occurred.

And in that sense it misrepresents the facts.

In a case that X embarrassingly must admit was not
cited in our brief, United States Cartridge vs. United States,
a decision of this Court, and we overlooked it until two days
ago, Volume 284, there was «**»
QUESTION* What page?
MR. KERENSs

Don't bother.

I think page 269, Mr. Justice Brennan.

There a munitions manufacturer at the end of World
War X was terminated by the government.

In 1918.

He

immediately wrote down his inventory to salvage value of
about $230,000.

While .settlement negotiations ware going on,

the Commissioner contended that the v/ritedown should be
postponed until the eventual payments by the government became
known, which occurred in 1921 or '22.

And the total payments

amounted to $730,000, a difference of 500,000.

22
This Court, in a unanimous opinion at, that time,
stressed that -** the taxpayer was in the iower-of-eost-ormarket — stressed that the annual accounting period applied
inventory as events happened, and that the taxpayer was entitled,
to write it down as he saw the situation in 1918, of 230,000,
Because, even though there was a prospect of later recovery,
which indeed occurred, this should be taken into income in
the later year as it became a closed event,
I think, Mr, Justice White, this is quite parallel
to the line of questions you were addressing to me earlier,
QUESTION § So how did you run into 284 U,S,?

You

just didn’t stumble on it in the —
M3, BE HENS * Well, we were reacting some of the cases

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SMITHs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
In the
at stake

in this case, which is familiar to all of us, I think,

in computing our
loss can

government’s view there is a fundamental issue

tax liability, and that is that a deductible

only be established by a closed, and completed trans»

action, fixed by an identifiable event and not by fluctuations
in value.
We all know this to be the case when we buy a share
cf stock, a house, it goes up in value or down in value? those
are paper losses,

bo

to speak, and are irrelevant in computing

our tax liability, and only when we sell or exchange or
I

otherwise

dispose of the asset does the loss become fixed.
Well, this case involves inventories, which is

somewhat technical in nature? the same principle applies.
Because inventories really are simply a device of computing
the cost of goods sold and its basis, and thereby measuring a
given year’s income within the annual accounting system, which
is central to our tax system.
The Court recognised as much in the Catto decision,

24

in Volume 384 U.S8 , where it saids

the general and. long-standing

rule for all taxpayers, whether they use cash or accrual method
of accounting, is that cost incurred in the acquisition of
inventory may not be currently deducted, but must be deferred
until the year of sale, when the accumulated cost may be set
off against the proceeds of sale*
In that particular case, a portion of the regulations
at

issue here were under scrutiny»

That is 1»471-6, as they

Here we are principally concerned

And I think that, wit!'* the Court's in­

dulgence, the best way to explain the Commissioner’s position
is to look at the details of these regulations» Because these
regulations have been around since 1922, they were promulgated
pursuant to an express statutory command of Section 471, which
is essentially th® same now as it was back in 19- — the
Revenue Act of 191ft, and they are essentially the same»

If

you read the old cases and you look at the footnotes, Article
1582 is virtually the same as these regulations set out in
our Appendix»
Now, the new management of Thor Power came in in 1964,
and mads three large-seala reductions to its closing 1964
inventory» And by doing that, it increased its cost of goods
sold and thereby

decreased its taxable income. There was a

$2,75 million writedown of closing inventory to reflect
items that ware scrapped, obsolete»

There was also a $245,000

25

writedown to reflect some spare parts stocked for unsuccessful
products, and shortly thereafter these parts were sold at
reduced prices*,
TSie Commiss ionsr did not question these two write»
downs, and they are not involved in this case.

Why?

Because

in our view there was an identifiable event that established a
closed and completed transaction. That is, the scrapping or
the reduction of price of the spare parts,
How, hare we have a §926,000 writedown, which is
essentially an amalgam of three other writedowns, but I don't
think we have to go into th© nature of those three other1
writedowns, we essentially have $926,000 deduction which, in
our view, is qualitatively different from those other two
writedowns.

Why?

This writedown was based on the fact that

the taxpayer had estimates that this inventory was in excess of
& year's demand of its customers,
Now, I think th® important thing to point out at the
vary beginning is why this was the case. This tasjpayor, like

I

all manufacturers, manufactured machinery and had a stock of
spar® parts.

Now, economically it doesn't make sense, and

counsel, 1 think, agreed, and the testimony is to this effect
as wall,

It doesn't make sense to manufacture a machine and

then destroy the dies or the tools and then, when your
customers who ha'5/© this machine need spare parts five years
down the road, to re»tool for those spare parts.

So all the

26

spare parts are made at once, and they are made pursuant to
some estimate of what you think, how long your machine will be
in circulatione
Now, this is described as excess inventory» But 1
want to stress the fact, it’s not excess in the sense of a
farmer having a warehouse of oranges that are going to rot
or, you know, that’s kind of a glut on the market,

it’s a

storehouse of goods which is in excess of what you think you
can sail for one year.
QUESTION8
MR. SMITHS
QUESTIONS

That doesn’t mean that --

Mr. Smith, —
Yes?

manufacturer can perfectly, with perfect accuracy, estimate
the amount of ©pare parts h©’s going t© need.
MR. SMITHs

Absolutely, and X think this was —
He’s going to be high on some parts and,

if ha’s had bad staff work, ha’a going to ha low, perhaps, ©n
some others.
MR. SMITHS Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think it

was a perfectly reasonable business sense. And I think it goes
to the point that Mr. Justice Stevens explored with counsel
earlier, and that is, this was not an abnormal situation, this
was quite a normal situation.

In fact, on page 51 of our

brief, wo quota the testimony of Thor’s president, who conceded
that, "any business which is involved in the manufacture and

27
sale of products inevitably must have excess inventory»"
So I think that’s, you know, we don’t dispute that fact»
The point I simply want to make is that this was not
a glut of goods that had no utility, it was simply a stock of
goods that was in excess of a year’s demand»
So what did tha taxpayer do?

And tha Commissioner’s regulations, which 1 would like
to now turn to,

do not provide — in fact they explicitly

prohibit the reduction of inventories based on these kind of
estimates.

If there’s one principle that underlines all of

these regulations and has don® so for 60 years, it’s that
inventory adjustments must turn on objectively verifiable data,

They argue alternatively that they complied with the

their central section, that where it says "by such taxpayer

if you turn the page over, "However, petitioner must also show
that the method clearly reflects taxable income."

And our

point is that he hasn't done that.
And the reason he hasn't done that is that he hasn’t
conformed with the regulations.

I think, although the counsel

has denied that he's taxable under the regulations, ha really
does , because
/

QUESTION § Do you have to get to the regulations if
you take 445(b) entitled "Exceptions", which 1' take it means

(

that it's exceptions to Rule 446(a).

One of the exceptions is,

"or if the method used does not clearly reflect income".
MR. SMITHs

Right.

Then the Secretary makes the

computation.
QUESTIONS And that's the end of it, whether it
conforms —
MR. SMITHs

Yes, but I think, you know, I think you

have to get to the regulations only to determine whether, you
know, it clearly reflects income, because the regulations, I
think, you know, provide a detailed panoply of rules as to
what will, you know, meet the clearly reflected income
standard.
QUESTIONt

But even if it conforms to entirely

f

proper accounting practice, and even if the accounting pro\

fession would say, This is the only way to do it? if the

38

Commissioner can properly determine that it doss not clearly
reflect income, you win*. I would think»
HRo SMITH:

That's absolutely the case. And the

reason we win, in our view, is because this doesn't meet the
requirements of the regulations.
QUESTIONs

May I follow up on Mr. Justice Rehnquist's

point, with which I do not necessarily disagree.

Do you

perceive that there's any sort of a presumption in favor of
what a taxpayer does when it is in accord with gener filly
accepted accounting practice, and, moreover, his balance sheet
won't be certified unless he does what was done?
Is there any sort of presumption in favor —
MR. SMITH:

Well, I don’t think it’s a presumption

I wouldn't characterize it as a presumption.

I would simply say it meets that one leg

of the statute.

courts have traditionally characterized the taxpayer's burden
as a heavy one, and the Commissioner's discretion is a broad one.

39

QUESTION:

Even in view of the conjunctive language

in 471?
MR. SMITH;

Yea.

I think that9s right. And I think,

you know, I think, to follow up on your point, I mean I think
the taxpayer — and to get into the regulations — the taxpayer
has plucked out a sentence out of the regulations, which says
here that —
QUESTION; What are you reading from?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
our brief.

I'm in 471-2(b).
Page?
Page 85, I’m sorry, of the Appendix to

’’inventory ru3.es must give effect to trade customs

which come within the scope of the best accounting practice",
and then down below it says "An inventory that can be used under
the best accounting practice in a balance sheet showing the
financial position of the taxpayer can, as a general rule, be
regarded as clearly reflecting income."

I think that's what,

the regulations provide.
So I think, you know, that's it.

I mean, you know,

ivhat that sentence does, the taxpayer would have that sentence
stand as a kind of universal standard in derogation of the rest,
of these detailed rules that have existed, you know, for almost
sixty years.
QUESTION:

But, of course, one starts with the

statutory language and the regulations can rise no higher than

40
that.
MR. SMITH % Sura.
QUESTION:

Mv question really was whether or not the

statute itself does not put the burden on the Commissioner in
this type of situation, where the taxpayer has mat the first
requirement of the statute?
MR. SMITH:
Powell.

No.. I don’t think it does, Mr. Justice

In fact, you know, the portions of the Code in which

the ~ I mean, the general rule is that the taxpayer has the
burden of proof of
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Yes, I’m familiar with that.
Yes.

And I think that the portions of

the Code has a few sections which specifically put the burden o:
proof on the Commissioner by, you know, in accumulated earnings
tax case, if the taxpayer files a statement of reasonable cause
for accumulation, then the Commissioner has the burden, thatcs
by statute, in a case where the Commissioner asserts the 50
percent fraud penalty, the Commissioner has the burden.

Tax

Court rules provide that when the Commissioner raises new matte;
by answer, it has the burden -- I mean, I think that those are
unusual circumstances, and I think that the general rule has to
apply hers.
Simply qualifying under one provision, you know, unde:
one requirement of the statute, I don’t think shifts, you know,
provides any shifting of burden of proof.

41
QUESTION*

May I ask you just one more question, and

then I’ll be very quiet.
MR. SMITH:

Surely.

QUESTION*

How does a taxpayer in a business that

involves a substantial number of items comply with what I
understand your point is, and that is, that there must be a
realisation of a loss estimated to exist in inventory before it
may be taken in the taxable year in question?
How does one comply?
MR. SMITH:

You have here —*

Well, there are several ways.

In fact,

counsel averted to one of them, scrapping? scrapping of goods
and —>
QUESTION: Suppose you have a million bits and pieces
of inventory, you can't selectively scrap — perhaps you could,
but you’d still have a very large number of items that perhaps
properly should be written down.

On a cost~or~market inventory

basis, what does one do?
MR. SMITH: Well, what one does is look at the regula-*
tions which provide for a way of fixing the proper amount of
the writedown.
examples,

The regulations provide — let me give two

"f you look at page 85-86, there is a provision for

a writedown for damaged or imperfect goods, goods that have been
shopworn, et cetera, and the regulations provide that they shall
be valued at bona fide selling prices less direct cost of
disposition, whether you5re m the cost or lower~cost~or-market

42
method.

And the regulations go on to say* a little further down,

I suppose two-thirds of the way down on page 86, "Bona fide
selling price means actual offering of goods during a period
ending not later than 30 days after inventory date.”
Nov;, if I may drop down a few more — well, actually,
"The burden of proof will rest upon the taxpayer to show that
such exceptional goods as are valued upon such selling basis
come within the classifications avoce, and he shall maintain
such records of the disposition of the goods as will enable a
verification„"
The regulations, the hallmark of the regulations, the
touchstone, is independent means of verification.
Nov;, going on to page 87, if I may, the lower of cost
or market — and this sort of, in a way I'd like to clear up
what I think is a fundamental sort of misconception advanced by
counsel; and that is that somehow market means net realizable
•■’alue.

Market and. the lower cost of market doesn't mean net:

realizable value, it means replacement value. And. the reason it
means replacement value is simply because, as I said earlier,
the whole process of inventories is to determine basis.
In other words, if you buy something for $100 and then.,
two years down the road, you find out that you can buy it for
$50, well, if you — you know, the Commissioner will then say
if you're on the lower of cost or market, then if you went out
and bought one today you’d only pay $50 for it, but we'll allow

43
you a $50 writedown*

But again it has to be on the basis of

independent verifiable data»

If I may ask the Court to look <;x

one more of these detailed provisions, on page 88, subparagraph
(c) on the lower of cost or market, it says "Where the inventory
is valued on the basis of cost or market, whichever is lower,
the market value of each article on hand at the inventory date
shall be compared"»
In other words, the Commissioner's regulation — I
mean, I think it’s «— I don't think that it's incomprehensible
to infer that there's a tremendous amount of abuse in the
keeping of inventories? and the way the Commissipner has tried
to set up these requirements for almost sixty years is to
provide for independent verifiable evidence of inventory
reductions . And -«■
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH:

Well, Mr. Smith, what if
Yes?

Court or came in.to the Commissioner and said, "Look, my net

actually

scrapped it."

Here's what I could get if I

And suppose you said, "Well, we agree

with you that if you scrapped it right, now, that is the net

been no sales for at least a year. Did not the Commissioner
permit them to write those off at 100 percent as obsolete?
MR. SMITH;

There were two -» as I said earlier, there

were two specific writedowns, one of them for obsolete goods,
you're right, and the other one j/as for spare parts —
QUESTION;

And wasn't the test of obsolescence no

sales of a particular item for a; year?
MR. SMITH;

I think that — you know, they were

47
scrapped.

They were scrapped as obsolete.

In other words,

they met the scrapping requirement, the one that the taxpayer
feels so unhappy about,
QUESTION; Do you know whether or not the Commissioner
allowed writeoff for obsolescence merely

or

a shewing that an

item had not been sold for a year?
MR, SMITH*

I don't think there's anything in the

record that indicates that, and I would

suggest that that

wouldn't be the test of the regulations! simply because some”
thing wasn’t sold for a year, I don’t think indicates that it's
without utility or value, to the taxpayer,
QUESTION % And under what part of the regulation was
that particular writedown for obsolescence permitted?
MR, SMITHs

Permitted?

X would suggest to the Court

there's nothing in the regulations, as such, that permits a
writedown for obsolescence, or scrapped as obsolescent.

But

that it seems to us that the statutory basis for that is Section
165 of the Code, which simply permits a loss when something
becomes valueless, like when you had a casualty and your house
was ~

Exactly,

QUESTION:

When you realize loss,

MR, SMITH;

Yes, and it's sort of of no value to you.

Or whatever you can get for it,
I think my time has expired.

questions

If there are no further
