ORAL ARGUMENT OP MARK ALAN HART, ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HART:

Thank you, Tour Honor.

Justice» and may it please the Court:

Mr. Chief

I am Mark Alan Hart,

Deputy Attorney General of the State of California, appearing
as counsel for the petitioner.
Miranda v. Arizona opened a new chapter in the law
of confessions, a chapter that began with precise rules to
guide law enforcement in the conducting of a custodial in­
terrogation, that has over the years been read with some
different and expanded interpretations.
In the case at bar, the California Supreme Court
has applied the strict Miranda rules with one addition, that
a Juvenile who requests hie probation officer per se invokes
his Fifth Amendment right to be silent, no less than if he
asks for an attorney, and that his statements must be
suppressed without regard to whether or not they were in fact
involuntary.

The operative facts are brief.

On the

evening of January 19, 1976» Robert and

Helen Yeager were ©n their way to their home in the San
Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles.

Unbeknownst t© them,

H
respondent and two of his friends were following in a pickup
truck being driven by respondent®

They were looking for

someone to rob, they were looking for money, and they had a
gun®
The Yeagers arrived home®

The respondent and his

friends approached the house, approached Mr® Yeager and
during the course of an attempted robbery one of the other
minors shot Mr® Yeager and killed him.
The respondent was apprehended and brought into the
police station for questioning.

He was 16 years old at the

time of the offense and he had had prior experience with the
juvenile court system, including serving some time in a youth
camp ®
H@ was given the standard Miranda admonition.

He

was told that he had a right to remain silent and was told
that anything he said could and wouldbe used against him in a
court of law, that h© had a right to an attorney, that if h@
could not afford one, on© would be appointed for him without
his expense, and that h@ had a right to have the attorney
present during all stages of interrogation®
H© was asked if h© understood his rights and if he
wanted to talk to the officers®
and that h® might talk®

He -indicated that he did

But when asked if he would give up

his right to an attorney present, he responded, "Can 1 have
ray probation officer h®r@fK

To this, the officers replied.

5
well* no9 we can’t call your probation officer* right now, but
you have a right to an attorney,

And respondent’s response

was, well, how do I know you guys won’t pull no police
officer in and tell me he is an attorney.

And to this

the respondent was readmonished as to the standard Miranda
rights.

He was told you can have an attorney, you don’t

have to talk to us at all if you don’t want to; if you want
to talk to us without an attorney present, you can talk to
us; if you don’t want to, you don’t have to, that is your
right, do you understand that righte
The respondent indicated that h® did understand
that right.

And when asked if he would talk to them without

an attorney present, the respondent replied, "Yeah, 1 want
t© talk t© you.11
Later during the interview, the respondent con­
fessed to having participated in the; offense»

Juvenile court

proceedings were instituted, th© respondent’s confession was
admitted into evidence, and several other things were estab­
lished during the proceedings, including the fact that the
respondent had been

on

probation, that his probation officer

had counselled him as to some® family problems, but that the
probation officer under California law was a peace officer
and that respondent was told this.
The trial court mad® a finding of voluntariness.
Th® respondent was declared a ward ©f the court for having

6
committed a murder®

In reversing the judgment* the California

Supreme Court has taken the Miranda exclusionary rule and
applied the language dealing with requests for legal counsel
on© step further*

They have applied it to probation officers

by statute* peace officers in California®
It is petitioner's position that the instant con­
fession was obtained after a fully informed waiver of Fifth
Amendment rights* including the right to legal counsel* that
the admonitions* both admonitions given to respondent in
statements before and after each indicate a knowing and in­
telligent waiver* and that the statements war® properly
admitted®
The respondentts request to see his probation of­
ficer was at most an ambiguity at the waiver stage* and It
was clarified by the further admonition and the additional
waiver obtained that respondent had a clear desire to speak®
The petitioners suggest to this Court the following
rule or the following approach to this kind of situation*
that when Interrogating officers are faced with an ambiguous
response to a Miranda advisement, they should be permitted
to clarify the statement with further questioning in order
to determine whether or not in fact the suspect is expressing
an unwillingness to speak or merely making an informational
request®
If upon asking those clarification questions it is

clear the suspect Is not invoking hits Firth Amendment right
as is the ease here,, then police should be permitted to begin
an interrogation.
There are several things in the instant ease that
th© petition submits give this Court an indication of the
voluntariness of respondents statement, and that we submit
is the only permissible go under the Fifth Amendment, whether
the statement was voluntary, not obtained by overriding the
suspect's free will and based on an informed waiver of rights.
Number ©n@g respondent nowhere alleges that it was
an uninformed waiver or that he did not understand his right
t© an attorney or anything about the Miranda rights ware un­
clear to him.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't suggest, do you, Mr.

Hart,, that if there had been no Miranda warning, a finding of
voluntariness would gave the ease under Miranda?
' •}

MR® HART:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, respectfully

while that Issue need net be reached in this ease, we would
suggest that th© Miranda warnings are not necessarily applic­
able to juvenile proceedings.

This Court has noted and the

respondent, has conceded in his brief on th© melrts that this
Court has never specifically applied the precise Miranda
exclusionary rule to juvenile court.
QUESTION:

What if this were an adult proceeding?

MR. HART:

In an adult proceeding, the Miranda rule

8
is presently the law ©f the land and the Miranda admonitions
would., of course,, apply.

They are perhaps —

QUESTION:

He wasn’t in the juvenile court when he

MR* HART:

Yes, he was.

QUESTION:

I thought he was with the police.

the poliees be was arrested as a juvenile suspect.
QUESTION:

He was

But was it the same place that arrested

the other suspects?
MR, HART:

Teg, It was, Tour Honor«

QUESTION:

MR. HART:

The difference is this:

ceedings, while adversary in nature, are Interested in some
different societal goals that the adult criminal —=
QUESTION:

Well, couldn’t they have beaten the

confession out of him?
MR, FART:

Certainly not.

FI

Why certainly not?

IFIF

MR. HART:

Because the Firth Amendment prohibits It,

QUESTION:

It is different with a junveile3 Isn’t

it?
Mf?. HART:

Correct 8

Q'/ESTION:

The Firth Amendment doesn’t apply to a

9
juvenile th®;i?
MB, KART;

The Firth Amendment applies to juveniles.

This Court said so in In re Gault,
QUESTION:

I thought so,

MR. HART:

We would concede that the Firth Amend­

ment applies to juveniles.
QUESTION;

That Is what I thought.

MR, HART:

However, we take the following position,

by analogy to McKelver v. Pennsylvania:

What applies to

juveniles is the essentials of fairness within the due process
clause, net necessarily all of the procedural formalities
that would apply in an adult court, because juvenile proceed­
ings, although adversary in nature, stre instituted on behalf
of the minor.

The concern of the court is to find what the

best disposition Is for the minor.

As such —*

QUESTION:

Is that a state matter?

MR, HART:

Well, that was —

QUESTION:

Is that a state matter?

MR0 HART:

Juvenile proceedings in California

, i V-J ■

and I

believe in most states ar® instituted on behalf of the minor.
This Court —»
QUESTION:

The question as to what type of procedure

Is used for a juvenile is first of all state matter, and this
le the State Supreme Court which passed on that.
MR. HART:

Yes

10
QUESTION:

Doesn’t that preclude us?

MR, HART:

Not necessarily,

QUESTIONt

On that one point?

MR. HARTs

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

If the

Court looks at the proceedings in California as adversary in
nature but not strictly criminals then based on In re Gault
and McKeiver v. Pennsylvania* what the Court wants to apply to
Juveniles is the essentials of fairness.
Now* If we can have a voluntary statement that is
the product of an informed knowledgeable waiver* but there
has been a technical Miranda defect, that doesn’t necessarily
violate the Fifth Amendment’s prescription against compelled
confessions* particularly the ease where we are concerned
with

where we are dealing with a system that isn’t strictly

criminal* where w@ are Instituting proceedings on the minor5s
behalf and we are looking for the best disposition for the
minor.
In that case* artificial barriers to the truth
seeking process should be eliminated.

We submit that the

strict Miranda exclusionary rule is at times an artificial
barrier.

This case Is a perfect example.

The California

Supreme Court says per s© a Juvenile who asks for his pro­
bation officer is invoking his Fifth Amendment right and we
don’t need to consider whether the statement was in fact
voluntary*if there is that statement it must be suppressed.

11
I submit that is an artificial barrier to volunariness and it results in an otherwise permissible confession
under the traditional Fifth Amendment view,, the pre-Miranda
view* being excluded.

There is no basis for that kind of

application in this ease in the juvenile courte
Of course* in this ease our position is that the
minor was fully Mirandi^ed* was given the standard Miranda
warnings* and there is no basis for extending Mirarida beyond
that.
QUESTIONS

S© you day the strict Miranda rule* as

you put it* should not b® applied to juveniles because they
are not exposed to the criminal punishment* is that your —
MR» HART:

What we say is we shouldn’t have

artificial barriers to truth seeking —
QUESTION?

I was putting the question in that way*

MR, HART:

Our position Is that while they are in a

;; sense subject to custody, there are other societal values at

f

i'■ ■

-V

stake that do not necessarily exist in the adult system®

The

disposition in California is supposed to be on the minor’s
‘
behalf* and the gravity of the offense doesn’t necessarily
determine what the ultimate disposition of the minor would be.
Now* if a technical Miranda defect bars the court
from reaching the true decision as to what is best for the
minor* we submit that is wrong and we submit that it Isn’t
justified by the Firth Amendment.

All we need provide the

12
minors under McKeiver and Gault —
QUESTION:

Mr, Hart.

MR, HART;

Yes, Tour Honor?

QUESTION;

Is it not correct that what you are argu­

ing is that even if he had asked for a lawyer, that Miranda
should not have applied?
MR, HART!

Well ~

QUESTXON:

That there Is still the same technical

obstacle —
MR, HARTi

Certainly If he conditioned his willing­

ness to talk on the presence of a lawyer —
QUESTION?

Everything is exactly the same in the

transcript except ha says 1 want a lawyer instead of I want a
probation officera you still say Mirdanda should not apply
because it is & juvenile?
MR, HART;

I submit that a strict Miranda exclusion­

ary rule should not apply,
QUESTION:

In other words ~

MR, HART?

If he says can I have my lawyer present

and they say yes you can, and then he says I want him. before
you question me, certainly that is an invocation.

But if he

says can I have my lawyer present and they say yes you can,
and he says* well, I will go ahead and talk to you anyway,
that is not an invocation.

But we submit that the strict-

exclusionary rule which excludes otherwise voluntary statements

13
because the suspect has uttered magic words,
QUESTION:

Weil, suppose he says I want my lawyer

present now and they say, well, we’re sorry we can’t reach
him right now, d© you mind going ahead with the questioning,
and he says, okay, if you can’t get him I will go ahead with
the questioning,,
MR. HART:

We submit that is permissible3

QUESTION:

That would be permissible?

MR. HART:

That’s permissible.

QUESTION:

Would it be with an adult under the

Miranda ease?
MR. HART:

Our position is it should be.

QUESTION:

Well, maybe it should be, but accepting

the Miranda ease, would it be?
MR. HARTf

All right.

Accepting the Miranda ease,

I think that it would still be a permissible type of question
ing.

Under Miranda, certainly the suspect, if he asks for a

lawyer and. wants him present during the interrogation, the
interrogation has to cease, but
QUESTION:

Doesn’t the Miranda opinion say if he

asks for a lawyer, interrogation must cease until he gets the
lawyer?
MR. HARTs

There is language to that effect, but it

isn’t necessary fe© the disposition •»QUESTIONs

Well, there Is a lot of language that

isn*t necessary to the decision in Miranda eases.
MB, HART;

We would offer the following example;

There Is a ease in California, upon which this case was built,
People v. Randall, which held that any indication which
reasonably appears inconsistent with the present willingness
to discuss the case freely is an invocation of the right.

In

Randall, the suspect was arrested and Mirandiged and asked
to call his attorney.

He called his attorney and spoke t©

his attorney, told his attorney the situation, and the
attorney did not advise him t© remain silent.

After that,

the suspect I believe was re-Mlrand±ze& and agreed to talk t©
officers.

Now, there is an indication of where the suspect

•

A <J1

clearly wanted his —
QUESTION?
jargon?

Is that a new word in law enforcement

Mirandised, is that it?
MR, HART;

Excuse the colloquial.

He was admonished

per the Miranda ©pinion as to what his rights were under the
Fifth Amendment.
QUESTIONi

You certainly did save a lot of wind by

saying Miranda®
(Laughter)
MR. HART:

In any ease, the suspect in Randall ~

and by the way, that confession was excluded by the California
Supreme Court -«= but we submit that It was voluntary under
Fifth Amendment standards

15
QUESTION:

Well9 that is not the Miranda test«

MR. HART:

That’s true.

That’s true3 and to that

extent the Miranda test is a departure from the laudable
goals of the Fifth Amendment and the goals that I think this
Court was attempting to pursue in the Miranda opinion —
QUESTION:

But it is a step and it has been taken,

MR0 HART:

That’s true,, and certainly the decision

in this eas© doesn’t turn on whether or not there was a tech­
nical Mirande defect„ because as far as the admonitions
required in the Miranda opinion,, those wer© complied with In
this case.

Beyond that, there were a number of other con­

siderations s voluntariness —
QUESTION:

Did I understand you to say that there

is a case in California where a lawyer told a guy under the
Miranda ruling don’t talk?
MR. HART:

Noc

QUESTION:

The lawyer told him to go ahead and talk.,

MR. HART:

No3 h© didn’t say one thing or another,

QUESTION:

He didn’t tell him not to talk, did he?

MR. HART:

Right.

QUESTION:

Well, what happens to all of that has

didn’t he?

been made that you don’t let him talk to the lawyer because
the lawyer will automatically tell him to shut up?

What

happens t© all of that theory we argue here every day?

MR. HART:

Well, I think —

QUESTION:

1 guess it is gone, isn’t it?

MR, HART:

=»- the presence of a lawyer during in­

terrogation is not necessarily so that the lawyer —
QUESTION:

At least there is one case that says so®

MR. HART:

But there may be occasions when it would

be to the suspect’s advantage to talk, particulary if he had
a good alibi and a lawyer —
QUESTION:

Wasn’t that long before Miranda?

MR. HART:

Certainly®

QUESTION:

I believe Mr® Justice Jackson said any

lawyer worth his salt is going to tell the client not to talk
until he, the lawyer, knows in private what he is going i©
say.
MR® HART:

Well, we submit, four Honor, that there

might be indications where a lawyer would not make that state­
ment to his client®
QUESTION:

Perhaps after he had had the private

conversation®
MR. HART:

But along those lines, Your Honor, return­

ing to this ease, certainly a probation officer is not going
to he in the same position®

As a matter of fact, as

California’s Justice Mosk noted in his concurring opinion in
this ease, the probation officer as a peace officer probably Is
under an obligation to counsel his charge to cooperate fully

17
with law enforcement officiale»
QUESTION?

This probation ~

How do we expect this respondent here to

know about that obligation of the probation officer?

You

wouldn9t9 would you?
MH„ HART?

Number on©» Your Honor9 the record in­

dicates that the respondent was aware of the fact that his
probation officer was a peace officer; number two8 th® record
indicates

and the trial court made a finding that this

respondent had prior experience with the juvenile court syst©mg
presumably had an attorney at that prior experience» and
understood what he was waiving; number three, the respondent
nowhere alleges in any of his briefs that he didn't understand
what an attorney was or what an attorney can do for him or
that he thought his probation officer could perform the func­
tions of legal counsel; but8 number four s there is no justi­
fication for the per s@ rule adopted by the California Supreme
Court below.

It cannot be said that any juvenile who asks for

the presence of his probation officer is Invoking the legal
counsel language of Miranda.
And it is Interesting?
Court in

The California Supreme

the ©pinion below distinguished ©r attempted to

distinguish this kind of request from a r@qu@sts say8 for a
clergyman or a football coachs and said that sine© th© pro­
bation officer is someone who has a legally recognized rela­
tionship with the minor» requests for a probation officer

xrould be reasonably Interpreted as a request for counsel
within the meaning of Miranda.
The petitioner submits that that conclusion does not
follow from their analysis»

A clergyman* for example* also

in California has a legally recognised relationship with a
particular penitent* and there is a —
QUESTION:

A clergyman would surely b© bound by

confidence with respect to anything imparted to him* whereas
the probation officer would be in a contrary position* would
he not?

He would be bound to report this to the court from

which he -MFU HART:

Exactly.

In fact* by statute in

California* the probation officer Investigates allegations
against minors* brings the sources of those investigations
to the District Attorney or to the local prosecuting
authority.

At the time this inktan

ease began in the

juvenile court* the probat .ion officer by statute actually
filed the petition alleging that the minor was a ward of the
court and had committed a certain offense.
QUESTION:

Would you ha sard, a guess — you don't

have to if you don’t want to -«» as to what the Supreme Court
of California might have done if the probation officer had
indeed come in response to a call and privately advised the
respondent to tell everything* and then it came to the
California Supreme Court in that posture?

19
MR, HART:

Okay,

Two responses to that without

making’ a guess —•
QUESTION:

Would it not be the State of California

advising the man to surrender his rights?
MR. HART:

It would be, certainly,*

First of all,

under California law
QUESTION:

By certainly, doyou mean that is probably

what the Supreme Court of California would decide?
MR, HART:
cide®

Well, I am not sure what they would de­

1 would say first under »<•»
QUESTION:

It is a dangerous guess anyway, isn’t it?

MR. HART:

Let me Inform the Court of a premise for

my guess®

First, under California law, the probation officer

would have to advise the minor of his constitutional rights
himself, as a peace officer»

Number two, again referring to

Justice Mask's opinion, he speculates as to just that
problem and talks about the Mutt and Jeff situation that
this Court referred to in Miranda, where you have a friendly
peace officer and an adversary peace officer working at odds
with each other, and he says the case is going to com® to us
and surely when it does, I don’t know what we are going to
do with 5.t,
Now, with that premise in mind, my guess would be
that the California Supreme Court would find that by statute
t&s probation officer is a peace officer and that in that

20
kind

of situation the advice the minor received from the

probation officer was not the advice of counsel and did not
comply with the requirements of Miranda and that it would be
just what the Court suggested, that it would be a pease
officer or the State of California advising the minor to
cooperate»

That is the problem.
QUESTION;

Another aspect of It, he was suspicious

that the person the police might bring in might not in fact
be a lawyer.
MR. HART;

That’s true.

QUESTION;

If the probation officer had assured him

that this third party was in fact a lawyer, perhaps he
wouldn’t have had that concern*, because presumably he trusted
his probation officer.
MR3 HART;

Well* that is a possibility, except I

think the fact that he was readmonished after he made that
suspicion and told that he didn't have to talk at all, that
was his right.
QUESTION;
batlon officer?

Why do you suppose he asked for a pro»

What do you suppose motivated it?

MRHART;

Personally, Your Honor, I think it was

just an informational question.
QUESTION;

To follow this statement, I don’t think

I could trust whoever you would bring in, but isn't it fair
to infer that he thought he eouM Iwil M©

21
MR. HART:

Well, there is some Indication in the

record. Your Honor, that he had been told by the probation
officer to contact the probation officer whenever he had law
enforcement contact, and certainly any offense that he might
have committed would have potentially been a violation of
the conditions of his probation, and the probation officer
would have wanted to know about it, so that perhaps is the
reason, although I really can’t speculate.
QUESTION:

I thought you felt he trusted the pro­

bation officer.
MR. KART:

I think there is some indication he

trusted the probation officer, and I think that the trust
would have been misplaced if he dealt with — if

he x«ranted

the probation officer to act as counsels
QUESTION:

He might have wanted the probation of­

ficer to tell him whether there was a counsel —
MR0 HART:

True»

QUESTION:

— or whether the counsel liras a phony.

MR. HART:

Petitioner doesn’t suggest that looking

at all of the minor's statements, the totality of the circum­
stances and his prior experience with the law enforcement
officials, that the trier of fact could not have found based
on the totality of his

circumstances that this minor was

Invoking his right to silence.

But the rule Is In California

that any minor who asks for his probation officer per se

22
invokes his right to silenee under Miranda, but if he asks
for any other confidente, a clergyman or a football coach,
the court will look at the totality of the circumstances*
The Fifth Amendment in Mranda does not justify
that kind of approach.
QUESTION?

Moreover «—

The question was, as you say, just a

request for information, can X have my probation officer
here*
MR. HARTs

And he was told he couldn't.

QUESTION:

And that formally at least was not a

request, it

was just a — to have the probation officer

there was jurat a request for information, can X.
MR, HARTs

That is correct, Mr0 Justice Stewart.

QUESTION:

But you have no quarrel with the Supreme

Court's equating that with a request for the probation
officer, do you?
MR. HART:

Well, if it was a request ~

QUESTION:

95 X would like to have my probation

officer here.”
MR, KART:

He certainly didn't condition his will­

ingness to talk on the presence of the probation officer.
QUESTION:

But you don't quarrel with their equat­

ing that with "I request that my probation officer be here”?
MR. HART:

Well, we do quarrel with it.

Other than that, there isn’t any distinction, and we wouldn’t

QUESTION;

sure you don’t pull a phony on him.

He says so right here,,

doesn't he?

Sure, they are constantly doing what

Miranda says don't do.
MR. HART:

At most, that was an ambiguous statement

which the police sought to clarify.

process of interrogation had not begun at that point„

The

police were seeking to clarify whether this minor was invoking
his right of silence0

QUESTION:

After they told him they would get the

probation officer,
MR. HART:

Right,

QUESTION:

After.

MR, HART:

I submit the minor fully understood and

26
the trial court found that he fully understood that he didn't
have to talk to them then if he didn't want to without the
presence of the probation officer,, and he agreed to talk to
them at that time and the trial court found that that was a
complete

waiver.
We submit that the laudable goals of this Court in

Miranda protecting against compelled confessions and insuring
that a suspect who waives his Fifth Amendment rights is fully
informed as to what he is doing, those goals were fulfilled
in the instant case»

This confession was absolutely voluntary

and there is no justification for the per se rule that any
minor who asks for his probation officer is asking for counsel
within the meaning of Miranda»
We will reserve the balance of our time for rebuttal»
Thank you, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT J. MENASTER, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MENASTER:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice9 and may it please

I am Albert Menaster, Public Defender's Office„

County of Los Angeles, for the minor, Michael C», the
respondent in this Court»
I would like to start out by telling this Court
about another youngster, this one named Joseph»

done on my behalf.

Use the

I don’t want things

I want to be treated just like an adult.”

And Joseph prosecuted his case through every layer of court
and one day reached this Court, and this Court decided
Joseph’s ease by saying you don’t get to be an adult, Joseph,
you don’t get your jury trial, and the case was MeKeiver v,
Pennsylvania.
This Court said in MeKeiver that there was some­
thing different about juveniles, something that is not the
same as to an adult, and that difference justified denying
Joseph a right every adult in this country has, and that is
the right to a jury.
Michael comes to this Court, and on his behalf I
read briefs by the petitioner and I have trouble with those
briefs.

I can’t find the word "minor" In those briefs.

MR, MENASTER:

Well, the problem is that the peti-

tioner fails to argue the application of the Miranda rules
to juveniles,

They go off on their theory of ambiguity and

their theories of totality of circumstances always focusing
on the suspect, never addressing the reality that a juvenile
is Involved in this case.
Now, the importance — I am glad the Court asked the
question

» the importance is that the Supreme Court of

California has recognized that vrtien a juvenile is Involved, a
16 year old, as in this case, a 1^ year old, a 10 year old —

As to requests for a

probation officer, that is quite different.
QUESTION:

The California Supreme Court has held

that a request by a juvenile to have his probation officer, or
more accurately In this case a request of whether he could
have his probation officer here was the equivalent of saying

MR, MENASTER:

I would be glad to, and it happens to

match up with the California Supreme Court's Idea?

The pro­

bation officer in California plays a unique role.

The proba­

tion officer has a statutory duty on behalf of the minor "to
act in the interests of the minor,"

It is clearly a parens

patriae attempt on the part of California to take away from
parents who failed and give control to a probation officer who

becomes a substitute parent in every sense of the parens
patriae conceptp and it is that fact that —

QUESTIOHs

Well, did it in this case?

Are there

such papers in this record?
MR. MENASTER;

It is clear that the minor was on

probation.
QUESTION;

Are there such papers in this record?

MRo MENASTER; Your Honor, it is clear that the minor
was on probation, and 725 through 731 of the code requires
that you can^t be put on probation unless that finding were
made, so that had to be true in this case.
QUESTION;

It has to be?

MRo MENASTER;

It has to be true, the findings had

to toe made for the minor to be placed on probation*
QUESTION:

I can see how California can do all of

that, but we have great difficulty in assuming things,
MRo MENASTER:

Well, again, the code sections that I

have referred to clearly delineate the required findings that

case has managed in his summary of facts to leave out what I

not left out In the briefs.

It is interesting because it is
It was left out in oral argument,

and that is this probation officer was not some artificial
probation officer that the minor simply inquired of

because

35
he couldn't think of anything else to do8

This probation

officer had told Michael, when you get arrested you call me
up, you demand that you be allowed to call me*

And he was

asked, oddly, by the district attorney, he was asked why he
said that, what reasons were there, and the answer was, so I
could advise Michael of his rights and make sure he under­
stood his rights.
The request for the probation officer in this case
wasn’t an academic request.

He was complying with an order

of his probation officer*
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that this record does not

show that he was advised of his rights by an officer of
California?
MR* MENASTER:

rights*

I am not arguing

Of course, an advisement from the police doesn’t mean

an understanding on the part of the recipient of that advice.
QUESTION:

Are you going to apply that generally or

just to this juvenile?

Well, there is no question that this

It

is the waiver that has to be voluntary and knowing and

QUESTIONi

On your theory, there isn’t much use in

giving the warning, it is just rhetoric.

He showed his fear»

I think the record is clear on

that point, and therefore in this case what Michael was doing
was asking for help to get a further understanding of what he
was getting into so he wouldn't get tricked, which is exactly
what he said to the police, and a page later they say, well,
we don't always play fair, do we, certainly not something
that is going to make Michael feel confident.

He finally only talks after being threatened and promised

MR. MENASTER:
QUESTION:

No, I don’t want to rewrite Miranda.

Please don’t,

(Laughter)
MR. MENASTER:

I

vote not to rewrite Miranda.

How­

ever 9 Miranda has never been applied to a juvenile, and that
is the point I made at the outset.

If we are going to say

that only if a juvenile uses certain words, attorney, words
that adults would use, does the Fifth Amendment become
invoked, then we are ignoring the reality that Michael wasn't
an adult.

He was a juvenile.

Juveniles aren't expected ~

X don’t expect juveniles to ask for attorneys, let alone
understand the rights sufficiently to be able to assert them,
and therefore this Court has to decide on® of two things,

Either Miranda applies

differently to Juveniles or it doesn't.

police must advise him of his right to an attorney, not that
they can't question him only if he raises it on his own
motion, so to speak?
MR0 MENASTER;
QUESTION;

Yes.

So it isn't a question of the juvenile

having to think up a right to an attorney, the police have
to tell him.

olds,, 10 year olds to know attorneys off the

top of their heads„ let alone even know about public defender
systems.
QUESTION:

Well* how does a 22 year old necessarily

know how to get an attorney?
MR. MENASTER:

Well,, we draw lines somewhere, I

admit, and I think that the rules of «- the system in
California drawing a line at 18 between Juveniles and adults
is a recognition that with majority comes maturity and certain
requirements ife assume are going to be applicable to a person
who is an adult.

To a person who is a juvenile, it is un­

realistic, as the Supreme Court of California said in Burton,
it is unrealistic to expect that a youngster is going to ask
for an attorney and be able to get one.

He is going to get

JJ1
his parents to get him an attorney or, as in this case, a
probation officer, as was suggested earlier, and assure that
the attorney that ;Ls brought in is a bona fide attorney and
not a sham.

I think that is quite clear from this record,

I would like to stress one further point, and that
is we have heard over and over again about how this probation
officer was a peace officer.

The California Supreme Court

expressly relied on the California statute, welfare and
institutes code section 280, which says that the probation
officer’s required to act in the Interests of the minor.
That is statutory duty that is mandated by the California
code section, was construed by the court in California as
the reason why a request for a probation officer In this
case invoked Miranda.
I want to disagree with something else the peti­
tioner said.

The petitioner says, "Any request by a minor

for any probation officer invokes Miranda per se9"
the California Supreme Court, that is not true.
from the California Supreme Court’s language®

According to

It is clear
They were

saying that Michael’s request in California for a probation
officer in this case — remember the background, the probation
officer advising the minor to call him so he could advise him
of his rights and help him understand the rights, obviously
helping insure the trustworthiness, to make sure that an
attorney was reliable and not a sham artist.

That was what

42
the California Supreme Court relied on.
QUESTION:

What would you say, counsel, if the pro­

bation officer had come, had a private conversation with the
young man for a half hour or an hour, then came in and said I
have adivsed my client, my patient, whatever they call them,
my charge to tell you the whole story, I think in the long
run that is going to be the best thing for him, and then he
told the whole story?
MR. MENASTER:

What would you say about that?
Well, let me point out that t,his

Court doesn't have to reach that issue, but I would like to
answer it.
QUESTION:

We ask a lot of hypothetical questions.

MR. MENASTER:

I would be glad to answer it.

I

think that a statement made under those circumstances would
not be admissible because the minor asking for the probation
/'

officer is asking for that person prescribed by the court to
act on his behalf.
on his behalf.

He thinks he is getting somebody acting

If the probation officer comes in and plays

the, role of prosecutor, becomes an agent of the prosecution,
it is just like a sham attorney.
QUESTION:

Do you think a lawyer who advises his

client to tell the truth and throw himself on the mercy of
the court is acting like a prosecutor in every case?
MRo MENASTER:

NO.

And I think the difference is

that the attorney has a duty on behalf of the younster®

If a

*13
probation officer fulfills that duty on behalf of the
youngster and the result is that the minor should make a
statement, that is one thing.

But if he acts as a prosecutor

and enhances the prosecution to get a statement from the
minor when the minor doesn’t really want to make a state­
ment , then he is contradicting that role, then he has been
duped, then he has the equivalent of a sham attorney that
Michael was so

worried about.

QUESTION:

Mra Menaster, a moment ago I thought you

said that the California Supreme Court’s decision turned on
the facts of this case.

Perhaps I misunderstood you»

I want

to ask you about the language on page 25 of the petition for
writ of certiorari where they says "Here, however, we face
conduct which regardless of considerations of capacity,
coercion or voluntariness per se invokes the privilege against
self incrimination, thus our question turns not on whether
the defendant had the ability, capacity or willingness to
give a knowledgeable waiver, and hence whether he acted
voluntarily, but whether when he called for his probation
officer he exercised his Fifth Amendment privilege."

That

sounds to me like a perceiver, not under this particular
facts, this particular case0
MRc MENASTER:

Well, I don’t agree0

The first word

in that sentence is the crucial word and it is the word "here."
The California Supreme Court discussed the dynamic of this

relationship, the extraordinary unique facts involving this
case, and fashioned a rule that I submit is a very narrow
rule0

Now, I would be glad to have this Court or the

California Supreme Court fashion a real broad rule, but all
that the California Supreme Court did — arid if you read the
opinion over and over again, they say, Michael's request
in this case was for his probation officer, invoked his
right.

They repeatedly use that phrase.
QUESTION?

You have emphasized that under the

California statute the probation officer must act in loco
parentis In every situation.

Suppose you had a 16 year old,

not on probation, no prior criminal record, in the same pos­
ture and who said I x^ant to talk to my father first, and my
mother, and his father and mother are brought in, they spend
an hour talking alone — and I am sure you can find many cases
on record precisely to this effect — and then they come out
.

and the father says we have decided to tell Joseph to tell
everything, we think that is in his best Interest, and then
he tells everything.
MR. MENASTER: Well, the critical question is exactly
whole role the parents played.

There is a case in California

involving -QUESTION:

Well, they played the role that I just

described.
MR. MENASTER:

There is a case in California

155
involving an attorney who talks to a suspect because the
police ask him to, and the police say, listen, if you get
this suspect over here to make a statement, we will let your
client out.

The attorney says, oh, good, and he goes in and

gets him to make a statements
QUESTION:

That is another case.

MR0 MENASTER:
QUESTION:

No0

But the point is —

Would you address my question®

MR. MENASTER:

The point is that the role the

parents play is the critical question®

If the parents advise

a minor of his rights, assist him in understanding his rights*
in other words assist — what Miranda is trying to get at,
that understanding and xvaiver of rights, there is nothing
«

wrong with it.

The parents act on behalf of the police to

get a statement out of the minor analogous to the attorney
example I just gave, then it is not a valid waiver because
he has been duped.
QUESTION:

That Is the critical difference,
Mr. Menaster, suppose, a very simple

case, a hypothetical, suppose the probation officer had
dropped dead,

he couldn't question him, right?

MRo MENASTER:
QUESTION:

You couldn't question him.

MR0 MENASTER:
QUESTION:
for that?

Right.

Right.

Where in the world can you get support

MRo MENASTER:

Well, it is just a hypothetical.

It

seems to me that the logic of what the significance of the
minor’s request is what we are focusing on.

And if the minor

shows that he doesn’t trust the probation officer, he is not
sure he is going to get the advice and the cooperation that
he needs to really make a waiver, that what else happens
doesn’t matter.

That minor has asserted his rights under the

Fifth Amendmento

QUESTION:

He could go out and commit three more

crimes,

Ke isn’t goingto be convicted of anything in your

book until the probation officer was reincarnated.
MR. MENASTER:

The same rule would be true, of

course, if the defendant said I want Mr. Belli as my attorney,
in fact Mr. Belli was his attorney and Mr. Belli dropped
dead.

If he keeps asking for his attorney, the police can’t

say, well, he is dead therefore we get to question you0

don't ask me another one.
MR0 MENASTER:
QUESTION:

I don’t get paid to answer your questions,

MR» MENASTER:
them.

I wasn’t asking a question»

Well, I hope I get paid to answer

My answer is that the same would be true if a youngster

asks for his parents instead of for an attorney.

If a

youngster shows In a way that a youngster would that that
youngster wants help in understanding his rights, that is an
invocation of the Fifth Amendment.

It is not fair to

juveniles, it misses the point of MeKeiver to say that the
youngster can only assert his rights by using an adult
formulation.

The reality is that youngsters are young

persons, and young persons ask for things in a different way.
It would be like making up a special word, a long word that
had to be said and the youngsters couldn’t say the word.

The

youngster knows that he has a right to an attorney, but he
also knows that he can’t hire an attorney»

That is what he

has to have a parent or probation officer for.

He knows

that if they bring in an attorney, he has never heard of him,
he doesn’t know whether he is going to be tricked or not»
fact, the police are threatening this monir, I think it is
quite clear that Michael was terrified of the police.

He

wants someone to give him a guarantee that that attorney is
on the up aid up, and that is why he is asking for his pro­
bation officer in this particular case.

In

4g
I would like to turn to another point which I
think has not been stressed nearly sufficiently in this case,
and that is that beyond the technical Miranda issue in this
ease there Is a further issue, an issue not referred to at
all in petitioner’s opening argument, and that is that inde­
pendent of the Miranda grounds there is a second issue here
concerning the voluntariness of the confession apart from the
request for the probation officer»

Michael repeatedly is

asked —> in fact, he is asked within half a page of his
supposed waiver, "I)o you want to tell us about the murder?
Answer:

No."

The petitioner says that is ambiguous»

I have been trying to figure out how that cuuld
possibly be ambiguous, and I still can’t figure it out.
Perhaps petitioner will tell us.

Three or four pages later

he is asked, "Do you want to tell us what happened?”
says, 5!No."

He

Three or four pages after that, they say, "Do

you want to tell us what happened?"

He says, "I can’t."

Finally, after ten pages of exchange in which
Michael makes no admission, no confession of any kind, it
wouldn’t be usable or worth a whit in any proceeding, before
he makes any kind of statement, the police finally say, "Okay.
That’s it, somebody is going to come out of this pretty good
and the one who tells us what happened is the one who is not
going to get hassled»"

There is then a pause in the record­

ing and during that pause, as described by both trial counsel

50
and the trial court, that is characterized as crying»

So

Michael is threatened;, he criess he breaks down, and then he
immediately makes the statement that forms the basis for his
confession»
Now, I find it hard to believe that that is not an
involuntary statement, forgetting Miranda, but just on the
standard voluntariness of totality of circumstances test.

It

seems to me that the petitioner has not dealt with that
problem and the petitioner needs to.
Let me go back then to the critical issue that I
think applies to this case»

This Court has to decide whether

juveniles are going to be treated like juveniles when it
comes to jury trials, perhaps bail»

But when it come3 to

Miranda, we are going to make juveniles be adults and use
adult words in order to invoke a right when they clearly are
terrified, they are being threatened, they are asking for
help — I find it amazing that petitioner characterizes this
as simply an informational inquiry»
I suppose the theory is that Michael would like to
come before this Court -«* to go to the police station and say
well, I have an academic question, I am writing kind of a
thesis on constitutional rights, could you just tell me what
you think the Supreme Court will decide on whether I have the
right to a probation officer or not»

I think that that is

an Incredible reading of this record, an unbelievable reading

51
of this records

And I think that a fair reading of this

record is that Michael wanted help because he wanted to make
sure he wasn’t going to be tricked0

In fact, he got tricked,

I contend.
The point is that Michael ought to be treated as
a Juvenile because he was a juvenile at the time of this
ease,.

He was treated as a juvenile and it is artificial and

unrealistic to expect that only a request in adult terms is
sufficient to satisfy what Miranda was talking about when it
was talking about protections0
Incidentally, I would like to disagree with the
petitioner on one further point, and that is I think Miranda
applies to juveniles.

We have yet a further extension by

petitioner In this caseD

The petitioner wants this Court to

treat juveniles like juveniles when it comes to jury trials
but don’t treat them like adults even if they ask for
attorneys, a request which would Invoke Miranda in any adult
case.

It is an Incredible position, a position not mentioned

in the briefs incidentally, and one which I think this Court
should summarily rejecto
This Court has to decide In this case how to apply
Miranda to juveniles.

This is not an extension of Miranda,

It is an application of Miranda»

This Court will choose

either to apply Miranda in such a way as to make it artificial
and require juveniles to be adults when they are not required

52
anywhere else to be adults or it will recognize the realities
of a juvenile situation, and it

will conclude that where a

juvenile shows that that juvenile wants help,

that it is not

fair, it is a violation of the Fifth Amendment for the police
to continue to interrogate him»

I would like to close
of all, the incredible argument

-with just two thoughts. First
by petitioner that there was

an unequivocal waiver in this case.

Once Michael says yes,

sandwiched in between all of these no's, and what about
being tricked and all of that sort of thing, reminds me of
a Wizard of Id cartoon where the king says to the lawyer,
"Your client confessedAnd the lawyer says, "How do I know
it was voluntary?"

And the king says, "Because, look, there

is your client's signature right there underneath the blood
stains c"
It seems to me that in this situation Michael made
an unequivocal waiver, but he did everything else he could
possibly think of to say he didn't want to waive.

He showed

fear, he showed anxiety, he asserted his rights under the old
involuntariness test, and I submit that Michael clearly
asserted his rights sufficiently to invoke the Fifth Amend­
ment, apart from .any Miranda consideration.
I think that the bottom line of this case is that
the petitioner in this case Is arguing that because of the
technical nature of Miranda, we have to be very cautious in

33
analysing what kinds of things we are going to technical!
Invoke „
It reminds me of a quotation from Justice Wisdom
who said that if police efficiency were the only important
thing, then the rack would be all right.

There are things

more important than police efficiency, and they happen to be
listed in the Bill of Rights®

I charge this Court with

deciding whether juveniles are juveniles, whether Miranda
applies to juveniles and recognises the reality of juveniles,
or whether this Court will hide its head in the sand and
pretend juveniles are adults, deny them rights when that
argument is made, but deny them rights when they assert what
are juvenile rights in the same context, and I would ask the
Court to carefully consider the decision in this case for the
impact it will have on probation systems, on juvenile systems
throughout this Nation®
Thank you.

MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further, counsel?
!

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK ALAN HART, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER—REBUTTAL
MR. HART;

The problem with the magic words approach

adopted by the California Supreme Court that a request for a
probation officer ie per se a Fifth Amendment invocation is
that it does not necessarily bear any relationship to the

54
Fifth Amendment®

We submit that this approach of attempting

to determine or predict the subjective intent of any minor
who asks for his probation officer takes away the traditional
role of the tier of fact to determine if in a given Instance
a minor is snaking a voluntary statement.
The critical factor in Miranda was whether a suspect
wanted to speak.

This Court found that a request for an

attorney is reasonably an indication that a suspect doesn't
want to speak.

There is no basis for the same reasonable —

the same conclusion and the same per se rule with respect to
probation officers.

This Court noted that in In re Gault

when the State of Arizona attempted to argue that they didn't
have to provide the minor with counsel because the probation
officer could provide him all of the services of the attorney
and this Court rejected that®

It noted that probation

officers in the Arizona, scheme were also peace officers and
that they initiate proceedings involving the minor and they
could not provide the same assistance®
If a probation officer cannot fulfill the tradition­
al goals of legal counsel, then a rule which says any minor
per se invokes his Fifth Amendment right by asking for his
probation officer bears no relation to the goals of the
Miranda court and bears no relation to the Fifth Amendment®
I would like to talk just briefly about the other
contention of respondent, but indications in the record apart

55
from the request for the probation officer indicate that the
minor was Invoking his rights®
The respondent isolates all of those statements
from the context of the records and 1 think we have discussed
it pretty well in our briefs.

For examples the first one

that respondent mentioned«, where he was asked about the
murder and he says no®
anything about it®*’

What he said wass nNo9 I don’t know

Wow9 it seems to me that in the course

of any interrogation or any conversation,, there are going to
be times when there is a hestiations there are going to be
times when a suspect may deny participation in an offense,
but each one of those is not a separate invocation of the
Fifth Amendment®

It is something for the trier of fact to

look at.
The trier of fact in this case9 and the California
Court of Appeals and the California Supreme Court all found
that none of those were indications of the Fifth Amendment
invocation.

The sole issue in this case is whether the re­

quest for the probation officer was such an indicatione
submit that It was not.

We submit that the standard with

respect to juveniles should be voluntariness based on the
totality of the circumstances9 a standard employed by the
trial court in the instant case8 and we would submit the
matter., if there are no more questions from the bench®
Thank

We

56
MRo CHIEP JUSTICE BURGER:
