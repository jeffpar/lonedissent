MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-1439, Mew Jersey against Portash.
Mr. Stier, I think you may proceed when you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN H. STIER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STIER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The respondent in this matter was indicted by a
New Jersey state grand jury on two counts:

the first count

for misuse of his public offices for the benefit of a private
developer; and the second count for obtaining, fraudulently,
$31,000 from that developer through a conduit corporation
to which he was not entitled as a public official.
After a jury trial, the respondent was convicted on
count two and acquitted on count one.
The matter was appealed to the appellate division of
the Superior Court of New Jersey, which reversed the conviction
on one ground, and that was that in the course of the trial,
the trial court had ruled in such a way as to deprive the
respondent of his Fifth Amendment privilege, thereby causing
him not to testify; thereby depriving the petit jury of
evidence that it would otherwise have received.
The state appealed to the New Jersey Supreme Court,

4
which denied the state8s appeal and denied a petition

for

certification„
There are two issues which have been raised before
this Court»

One is whether the Fifth Amendment privilege was

properly asserted by the respondent at trial* and the second
was whether the Harris case* or the rationale of the Harris
case* was properly applied to the facts of this case by the
appellate division of the Superior Court of Slew Jersey,
The issues in this case arise out of a series of
in camera discussions which took place among counsel and the
court.,

During the course of those in camera discussions* a

number of issues were discussed* including the scope of
cross-examination of the respondent in the event that the
respondent, would testify and whether

the state would be

permitted to use any of the respondent * s pre-trial statements,
which were obtained under various circumstances under — over
an extended period of time for the purpose of cross-examination
of the respondent.
At the conclusion of the in camera discussions *
respondent8 s attorney announced that in reliance upon v/hat he
believed to be the court5s ruling, his client was not going to
testify,
QUESTION:

Is the case, in its present posture, in

your view* any different from what it would be if he had not
made this inquiry, but had taken the stand* testified and been

impeached on the Harris rationale?
HR. STIER:
QUESTION:
MR. STIER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
Ho difference?
Oh — there would be a significant

difference ---QUESTION:
MR. STIER:
QUESTION;
MR. STIER:

Nell -— which I'm about to get to.
Oh.
That difference is this:

During the

course of the in camera proceeding, the trial court, on at
least 14 separate occasions that I have counted in going through
the record, said that he would not rule generally on whether
the state could use, or under what circiamstances the state
could use, prior statements for the purpose of cross-examination.
\

T£ie court indicated that he was bound by a New
\\

Jersey law which requires him to rule on a question by
)

question basis;,
.

Because of the fact that no specific ruling was
permitted on a proffer of proof by the state for crossexamination purposes, we don't know specifically what circum­
stances would have been raised in this case.
QUESTION;

Would these —* question by question be in

front of the jury?
MR. STIER:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

There was a —

Is that.in the in camera discussion?

6

HR. STIER:

Your Honor, there was a procedure that

was established by the court and agreed to by the prosecution
and the defense during the course of the in camera discussion
which would require the state, in the event that the state
wanted to use a pre-trial statement against the respondent, to
ask for a side bar conference before the question was asked
in the presence of the jury.
QUESTION:
MR. STIER:
QUESTION:
MR. STIER:

Of each question?
Each question based on a prior statement —
I didn't see that.

Is that in the appendix?

Yes, Your Honor, it is in the appendix.

It's in the appendix in several places, and it was agreed to by
the defense early on in the discussions.
Now that specific procedure was established by the
court so that in the event that the court decided that the questions
based on prior statements could not be properly used, the
import of the .information would not be conveyed
QUESTION:

to the jury.

Mr. Stier, I'm trying to think through

whether this argument you're making is a question of state
procedure or a federal question.
Are you -- because I gather the state supreme court
considered for its purposes the question was adequately
raised to address the mex*its of it?
MR. STIER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Apd you're saying that as a matter of

7
federal law, a state may not permit this issue to be raised and
preserved in this way, is that —
MR. STIER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Our position is that as

a matter of federal law, in order to receive the benefit of tne
Fifth Amendment protection, a respondent is required to assert
the Fifth Amendment.
Our position is that in this case he did not assert
the Fifth Amendment because he did not take the stand under
the procedure that had been established by the trial court for
his protection? permit the issue to be framed in such a way
that it could be resolved on a constitutional basis.
QUESTIOK:
division here

What if the Hew Jersey court, the appellate

had said it was wrong for the trial judge to

refuse to make thi3 kind of general ruling, and refused to
follow the question by question approach that you say Hew
Jersey law requires?
Would we then have a federal question before us?
MR. STIER:

I think it would be a more difficult

federal question, because of the fact that the state court’s
ruling would have been based on state court procedure.
But on the other hand, in this case, there was no
discussion of state court procedure.

This case was decided by

the appellate division squarely on constitutional grounds.
QUESTION:

You say — just to be sure I have it clear

that in the bench conference, when this subject was discussed,

8

the judge made it clear that he would not make anticipatory
rulings, but would require them to submit the question at the
bench conference when and if he took the stand?
MR. STIER:

Thatss correct, Your Honor.

As a matter of fact, the trial court, when the
respondent's attorney announced that his client was not going to
take the stand, expressed surprise at that conclusion.
It indicated that the respondent had made a tactical
judgment, not in reliance on his rulings; with respect to tae
use of prior statement, but a tactical judgment not to testify,
and was simply using this as an excuse to surround his tactical
judgment with some constitutional implications.
In the course of the in camera discussions, the issue
-chat was faced and resolved squarely by the court was the
scope of permissible cross-examination of the defendant? that
is, the defendant argued that the scope of cross-examination
should be narrowed to the scope of direct examination, intended
to use only a very narrow area on cross-examination, and asked
the court to restrict the court, in its cross-examination only
to those factual issues raised.
The prosecution objected very strongly to that, and
took the position that the scope of cross-examination should
be as broad as all the evidence which it had put in in its
case in chief, none of which, by the way, have been alleged by
the respondent to have resulted from tainted — tainted

s
statements «,
✓

There is no element in this case concerning the way
in which the prosecution had acquired all the evidence which
it put in in its case in chief„
The trial court ruled,- then, that the prosecution
would be permitted to broaden its cross-examination to the
scope of its evidence which it had —• which had put in in its
case in chief as testimonial and documentary evidence, and
that in the event that further cross-examination or requests
by the state in which any of the respondent’s prior statements
would be used, the government —- the prosecution then would
have to approach the bench and raise the question at that
time with the court„
It was after the ruling on the. scope of cross-exami­
nation that the respondent indicated that he was not going to
testify and afe that point the court expressed surprise, as I
indicated before, and indicated that, in effect, the respondent
had made a tactical judgment.
Had he —
QUESTION:

What if he — what if he had never —

there had never been any immunised testimony at all, and the
defendant was going to take the — it was anticipated the
defendant was going to take the stand, and then the prosecutor
made this motion at the close of its case, or before the
defendant started his case.

10
What is the rule in Mew Jersey?

There is no such

restriction on cross-examination»
MR. STIER:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

The trial

court’s decision on the scope of cross-examination was based
on Mew Jersey case law which makes it clear that when a
defendant takes the stand, he takes the stand as any other
witness, and subjects himself —
QUESTION;

Well, I take it then the prosecutor

thought that if ha asked a —• that by asking a question
broader than the defendant’s direct, he perhaps could confirm
some of the — of the state's case in chief.
MR. STIER;
QUESTION;

That's correct, Your Honor.
He would ask him ■— he would ask him

whether or not a certain fact is true.
MR. STIER;
QUESTION;
MR. STIER;
QUESTION;

That's correct, Your Honor.
That you had already put in the case.
That's correct.
And you anticipated that if he didn't —

that apparently -- apparently the reason he wanted to ask that
was that there must have been something in his grand jury
testimony that gave you that clue.
MR. STIER:

No, Your Honor.

The position of the

state is that the evidence that was obtained, put in in the
case in chief, and the respondent never disputed that, was
all based on independent sources.

And it was that evidence that the prosecution
intended to use for the purpose of cross-examination within the
scope that the court —
QUESTION;

You may have obtained it from independent

sources, but there might be something in the grand jury testi­
mony that would

that would be relevant to or confirm one or

more facts in the state's case in chief.
MR. STIER;

It's conceivable that that might have

occurred.
QUESTION;

Well, it would have to be, or you wouldn't

want to — you would never get around to wanting to impeach
him with it.
MR. STIER:

I think that there is evidence that

was clearly outside the scope of his prior statements, which
may have been outside the scope of direct examination, which
the prosecution would want to use for purposes of crossexamination.
Had we —■ had the respondent testified, and had the
prosecutor approached that bench with a specific piece of prior
statement that it intended to use for cross-examination, we
would know the answer to your question, Your Honor.
We would know.—
QUESTION:

Well, your position then — your position

must be, then, that the existence of this prior testimony
wouldn't possibly have — or didn't exert any pressure whatsoever
not to take the stand

13
MR» STIER;

Mo, that may have been a factor; that

may have been a factor.
QUESTION;

Well,, how could it have been in the way

you just answered me?
MR. STIER:

It's possible, and the defendant

hypothesized —
QUESTION;

You ask him a question outside the scope

of his direct, which is relevant to your direct case, and you
want to confirm part of your direct case by his testimony.
Say he answers it a certain way, and then you want to impeach
him with something ha said in his grand jury testimony.
That has to mean, then, that there's something in
his grand jury testimony that supports your case in chief.
MR. STIER:

Oh, that's true, Your Honor.

I didn't

mean to —■ I didn't mean to indicate that there was nothing
in his grand jury testimony that wasn't relevant to the case
in chief.
QUESTION:

Not only relevant, but it supports your

zase in chief.
MR. STIER:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Well, isn't it your position thatyou have

3io way of knowing until he was asked specific questions on the
stand whether you would want to use that grand jury testimony
or perhaps some other independently acquired evidence to
impeach him?

14
MR. STIER:

Yes.

That's precisely the state's

position.
We don't know which statements, if any, the state
might have intended to use.

We don't know whether the state

would have taken the position that it would concede the
truthfulness of the prior statements, or claim that it was
false,
We don't know whether —- what purpose the state would
offer the statement for.

We don't know whether the statement

would have been claimed by the state to have been outside the
scope of the grant of immunity.
We don't know whether there would have been a
direct contradiction between what he had said previously and'
what he was testifying to at trial.
QUESTIONS

But Mr. Sfcier, isn't the view of the law

that the New Jersey Supreme Court expressed, if that should
happen to be correct, there wouldn't have been any purpose in
all these preliminary questions, would there*
In other words, if he had an absolute right not to be
impeached — to be free of impeachment with the grand jury
testimony — there wouldn't have been any need for all this.
MR. STIER;
QUESTION;

Which leads me to ask you:

In order to

raise the question of lav/ that you are ultimately going to get
to, why do we have to decide
this?

v/hy do we have to bother with

Because they did adequately preserve that issue,
didn't they?
MR. STIERs

I don't believe that's the case, Your

Honor.
There — even if the law is as the hew Jersey
appellate division, applied it —
QUESTION;
MR. STIER;

Right.
— there are still possible circumstancess

that could have occurred at the trial which would nave railed,
clearly outside the ilockenberry case, which is the case on
which the appellate division relied.
For example, if the particular piece of statement
that the prosecution intended to offer could have been
demonstrated to be false, or could have been demonstrated to
I

have fallen outside of the scope of the grant of immunity, then
it would have fallen outside of the Hockenberry case, and out­
side of the law as the appellate division applied it.
We don't know that, because we don't know specifically
what purpose the state might have offered it for, or what
the circumstances would be surrounding the —•
QUESTION;

No, but the other side of the coin is, that

if he'd been told by the trial judge that, well, I know the
appellate division views the grand jury testimony as not
usable, ha would have decided to get on the witness stand.
wouldn't have needed all that.

You

If we can take people as what

16

they represent to us, anyway»
MR» STIERs

If his representations are correct, then

he might, have gotten on the stand and testified had the ruling
been as broad as -- as the appellate division conceived it»
However, he still might have been faced, even under -QUESTION;

Supposing we hadn’t granted certiorari in

this case but waited, for the next case»

And at a second trial

under this, being the law of New Jersey»
Would you still say as a matter of dew Jersey law
you ought to go through all of that procedure?
MR. STIER;

Yes, Your Honor»

Yes»

Because there are situations in which I would argue
we don’t -- we're not bound by the Hockenberry decision»

We're

not bound by its scope»
I think it's important for me to take a moment to
discuss the circumstances under which the statements were
obtained from the respondent»
The respondent provided information on basically
three occasions:

twice in the state grand jury, and once in a

statement under oath outside of the grand jury several months
later»
During the first appearance in the grand jury, the
purpose for his testimony was simply to identify certain records
<P

which were not covered by the Fifth Amendment.
There had been a hearing by the trial court prior to

17
his first appearance

,

and he was ordered to produce certain

records before the grand jury and to simply identify what those
records were,
1-Ie appeared shortly after that time in the state
grand jury under the protection of the state's Public Official
Immunity Law*, which is a self "executing — or was at that
time -- a self-executing use plus derivative use immunity
statute*, which covered public officials testifying about conduct
in their public offices»
Several months later, as a result of a series of
discussions between .counsel representing the respondent at
that time and the prosecution, a statement was taken from the
respondent under oath outside of the grand jury for the
purpose of defining the testimony that was required for a case
in which it was contemplated that the respondent would ulti­
mately be a witness»
It was a related case„
was about to be

It was an indictment that

returned concerning fch© individuals who

operated the development company and the conduit corporation
through which the respondent had receive the approximately
$31,000»

Ultimately,, that indictment was returned»
It’s interesting, and I think instructive, to. look at
*

the change of position which the respondent has taken between
the beginning of the trial and this point»

18

His original argument, prior to going to trial, was
that the indictment should be dismissed because he, in effect,
had made a deal with the state in return for his cooperation
believe that the state had entered into a contract which
should have barred the state from returning an indictment.
Althoxagh it’s clear from the record that his cooperation,
his testimony in the grand jury, was a result of a desire to
strike a bargain with the state, the trial court at that time
found that no such contract had been entered into, and held
that the indictment should not be dismissed.
But it is clear in this case that we're not dealing
with a defendant who has been brought into a grand jury assert­
ing his Fifth Amendment privilege and refusing to testify.
There is more of a willingness demonstrated on the part of
this respondent to supply information, although he asked for
and received immunity protection, but a willingness to disclose
that information, because that disclosure was to be in his
best interests in disposing -ultimately of the criminal charges
.. that faced him.
QUESTIONs

Nevertheless, on that -- when he was

subpoened on November 14th, 19 74, the immunity was certainly
made express, was it not?
MR. STIERs

Yes, Your Honor; there's no question about

that.
QUESTIONS

And he was asked if he

he was asked if

19

he understood that, I take It?
HR, STIER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,
And — so there's no equivocation on what

the limits of the immunity were, or what the extent of it was,
I guesso
HR, STXER:
QUESTION:
MR, STIER:
QUESTION;

No, there is not,
Well, I take it you're going to get to -I'm about to,
-- why you have exceeded the limits of your

promise,
HR. STIER:

I'm about to.

The appellate division of the superior court has
relied on what is probably the leading authority m the
circuits on this question, and that is U.S, v, Hockenberry,
at 474 F,2d„
There have been only a very few cases decided on
this question.

Hockenberry has been relied on in each of

those cases.
Hockenberry, the state contends, is wrong

in one

respect, and certainly distinguishable in another significant
respect.
I realize that the Hockenberry case has only limited
precedential value here, but I think that the distinction between
the facts of the Hockenberry case and this case are extremely
important, and I want to take one moment to address that.

20

In the Hockenberry case, the defendant had been
subpoened t© a grand jury, and had testified truthfully
about having perjured himself previously and testified falsely
in another respect unrelated to the first»
He was indicted for the perjury»

At his trial, when

he testified, the prosecution used his truthful testimony
indicating that he had previously committed perjury for the
purpose of impeaching his credibility»
Clearly, the purpose was not to demonstrate a
conflict between his trial testimony and his grand jury
testimony»

The purpose was to permit the jury to infer from

the truth of what he had said in the grand jury, having admitted
committing perjury previously, to infer from the truth of what
he said that he was an habitual liar.
That is not the situation here»

No matter how you

construe the decision made by the trial court in this case,
it was clearly not so broad as to permit the jury to infer
from the truth ©f what would have been offered from his
prior statements any fact, but simply to demonstrate that there
was an inconsistency between what he had said previously
under oath and what he was saying now»
Most importantly, 1 think that the Hockenberry case
and the appellate division of this case misconstrued the import
of -the Harris case»

It had to distinguish Harris v„ New York

in order to get around the implications of that case»
The Harris case, of course, dealt with a Miranda

The —- when the compelling atmosphere

court compulsion, legal compulsion, is everted t© force the

Wellr what if your respondent -- I know

the state statutes, the immunity statute and the privilege
statutei and that therefore the — even though it draws on
federal cases, to inform the interpretation of those two
statutes — the whole decision rests on the state statutes,
and therefore on adequate state grounds, and therefore there's
nothing here for us to decide»

squarely on the Fifth Amendment, squarely on the Hockenberry
case, in defining the permissible limits of —

And that •— well what we have here is an interpretation

Well, Your Honor, I think that had the

Hockenberry ease gone the other way, I think that the state
statute would have been construed the other way by the
appellate division.

But as a matter of construction of the

guess 1 wrote when I was on the New Jersey supreme court, and
I thought we made quit© a point that the state statute was
informed not primarily by constitutional interpretation, but by
eetasE law interpretation of the privilege»
Is that case still law?
MR., STIBR:

That case was — that was decided before

this statute was enacted in response t© — to this Court's
holding in the casas which apply the Fifth Amendment to the
state and which have restricted the state in —•

Is the currant statute very different

MR. STIER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It Still is a statute.

Mr. Stier, suppose in granting the immunity

the state had said, we will not us® anything you say here

was®

ted we just want you to know we will not use it in — for

impeachment ©r for. cross-examination in any subsequent trial

ted suppose feh@a the state wanted to do what it wanted
to do here.

Would that violate the Fifth Amendment of the

constitution of the United States?
MR. STIER:

Mo, I believe that it would — it might

violat® the du© process clausa of the Fourteenth Amendment.

But

I think you would still hav© the same issue, what the scope of
protection of the Fifth Amendment is going to be.
QUESTIONs

Okay.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, your time is up.

But

I'd like to try to clarify one thing.
Had this man taken the stand, and the prosecutor in the
impeachment confronted him with his grand jury statement that
was given under the grant of immunity, and no other impeachment,
what would have been fch® court's ruling, in your view, if you
car© to speculate about that?
MR. STIER:

If he had been confronted strictly with

the ~
QUESTIONs

Just what h@ said in the grand jury under

28
the immunity grants»

Not

sobjs

of -the things he said at some

©th©r time under oath»
MR, ST1ER:

My argument would still be the same;
r

that the use ofhis grand jury testimony taken under a grant of
immunity for that limited purpose --not to infer the truthfulness
©f what he said in the grand jury* bat simply to show the conflict
between few© statements under oath, would have been permissible
under the rationale ©f Harris, and not precluded by the scope
©f protection afforded by the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

I take it from some of the other things

you've said that the constitution had material to use to
impeach him that was n©t included in the grand jury testimony.
MR. STISR:

JUasolufeely.

I think the record is

clear am that* and it indicates a substantial amount of
£nformation_whiph it intended t© use which fell outside of the
scope ©f his grand jury statements, or any other statements
that he gave.
QUESTION:

And you say that neither the prosecution

©r the court has any obligation to a defendant to tell them in
advenes how the rulings — what the prosecution is going to do,
and how the court3s going t© rule* until and unless he takes
the stand and is confronted with it?
MR. STXERs

That9s correct.

I believe that the procedure that was established
by the trial court to keep this information away from the jury
was fair* and is all that the defendant was entitled to.

Mr, Wilbert*

OEM, ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. WILBERT, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR» WILBERT?

Thank you, Mr» Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court?
The facts ©£ this case are that the respondent did go
before th® grand jury after advising the prosecutor that he
wished t© have his Fifth Amendment rights protected»
. Zt was only at that time, after insisting on his
Fifth Amendment protection and privilege, that he was offered
feh® grant of immunity under the New Jersey Public Employees
Inununity statute.
S© th© willingness was compelled.

It was- not him

earning forward and volunteering and saying, oh, by the way, do
I ®ls© have immunity»
H© refused t© testify»
from th® court0
explicit, as

Sought and obtained immunity

And the language of the immunity grant is

set out in our brief, Mr. Luciani also advising

him that, you know that what we obtain here today will not be
used against you personally in any subsequent criminal proceedings.
Thereafter, and as a direct result of the immunity that
he obtained, he gave grand jury testimony and he also gave other
statements to th© prosecutor.

30
1 submit that all of that testimony that he gave, and
all of those statements, are obtained by the state as a direct
result ©f his immunised grand jury testimony, and therefore
under Kastigar, clearly are precluded from use, as are the
grand jury statements»
QUESTION:

Wall, d© you mean that the prosecutor

could not impeach ©r undertake to impeach by use of statements
other than those in the grand jury if he had independent

eentrjidl&tQsy statements?
MR» ^LBERTs

If h© had independent, I submit, Mr

Chief Justice, that fe© coulda

But h© had no independent

MR. WIIsBBRTs

Mr. chief Justis©, I submit that under

Rastigar, any ©videas® that flows directly from the immunised

31
grand jury testimony is immunized to the same extent as the
immunised testimony itself„
And I think that under Kastigar in Mew Jersey, at

Could h@ be impeached on the basis of that?

Or do

you say that that also -MR, WILBERTs

If it wer© the prosecutors who caused

him to be intoxicated and took him to the

Alcoholics Anonymous

meeting, I think that —
QUESTION?

Well, you8re adding some facts now.

Usually people aren't intoxicated at Ah meetings, so I'm told.
Now,he's there, not intoxicated? or anywhere else,
the Chamber of Commerce, or wherever you want

him to be, and

he makes these statements.
You mean that all those statements are protected by
the grant of immunity from the grand jury?
MR. WILBERTs

No, I think the state could make an

argument, and possibly make a showing, that it was independent.
And if they carried fchsir burden

if they carried their

burden its a Kastigar hearing that it was independently
obtained, net through the grand jury testimony ©£ the defendant,

32
then they could «se that»

They can use that in the state of

Mew Jersey in any event»
However, the situation here was that after they
took his grand jury testimony they then called him back in on
February 5th, 1975, is the date that's quoted, called him back
in and took another statement under oath from him, on the
basis ©f th@ testimony that they obtained from him in the
prior grand jury proceeding„
They had none ofthis information that they examined
him on prior to the time -QUESTIONS

What compelled him to answer these

questions in the —
MR, WILBERT;

What compelled him was that he felt

he had the same immunity that flowed from the prior grand jury
testimony that he gave»
He was advised that he would not be indicted if he
gave grand jury testimony»

Ha did give the grand jury testimony

and he gave the subsequent statement that they called for.
They called him Into Freehold, Mew Jersey courthouse,
with a court reporter, and asked him to sit down and under
oath give them further information that they didn't have.
QUESTION;

You say that was compelled?

MR. WILBERT;

I submit -- that's compelled just as

though he were still in the grand jury.
QUESTION:

Well, what if he refused to come there?

33
Was there any proceas ©r any ©ontempt power that could have
forced him to go?
MR» WILBERTs

I think the state would have immediately

©ailed him before the grand jury and said, you've already given
testimony under immunity.

You're now required to continue

that testimony.
They called him back twice to -the grand jury.

I

don't think there would b© any limitation ©n the number of times
they'd call him back.
QUESTIONS

But you're telling us that when he went to

Mi® proseeutor9s offies» in response to an invitation, and
answered questions under oath, he was compelled to do that by

something?
MR. WILBERTs

¥©s, sir, I submit he was without

question, Mr. Chief Justie©.

After he had given testimony

nnder oath? he had given testimony in November and then in
February he was called back to give further testimony.

As a

result ©f the evidens® they had obtained from his grand jury

testimony.
It flows directly under Kastigar, 1 submit, and there's
n® question -- in my mind, I would submit, there can't be a
question as t© its direst consequence from the immunised grand
jury testimony.

QUESTION?

You have ~ don't you have to argue there

that kind of a dry run ©£ that sort is a federal constitutional
right that attaches along with the Miranda right?
MR. WILBERTs

I don't believe that I do, Mr. Justice

Refenquist, because I believe that the state found that the
court had mad© th© ruling -- th® sfafe© of New Jersey found that
th© court had ruled that th® testimony could be used to
impeach? that that ruling was improper? and that the stats
statute required that to us© fo@ made of the immunised

35
testimony with the exception of perjury' and false swearing.
They are exceptions that are built into the statute, and
which are still viable to the state in the event he testifies
at a subsequent trial®
Without the use of impeachment, he can he charged and

MR. WILBERT:

MR. WILBERT:

I d©n9t submit that I do in this particular

36
the substantive state legislative enactment; determined that
no use could be mad© of the testimony in the manner attempted
by the prosecutor* and that therefore the — and the court had
ruled that it could be used — and therefore the court had

I submit that we can be on completely adequate

The construction of the statute by the appellate

No, that isn’t what I asked you.

Did you

rule — ask that the cross-examination be limited to the scope

I did not actually articulate that.

But it can he used in a subsequent perjury charge.
But I submit that it is a due process question also under the

50

Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION;

But there9s no due process — was there

a due process argument submitted to the Mew Jersey courts or
not?
MR. WILBERT;

There was not a due process argument
v

submitted to the New Jersey, no, Mr. Justice White.
The mischief that the prosecutor attempts to impose
on the Courts though,, with regard to the Fifth Amendment
will serve no constructive purposes to prosecutors in general,
because the defendant, with the choice of either having the
immunity granted, knowing that it can be used to impeach his
credibility if your Honors s© find, I submit in many instances
will opt the later, and will not testify, and preserving his
rights at trial to

take the stand, free from the use of

impeached testimony.
And aa Mr. Justice White said in Murphy v. Waterfront
Commission, for a hundred years immunity statutes have been
used to ferret out crime
discovery;

that is otherwise impractical of

conspiracy and various forms* of racketeering.
QUESTION;

Well, suppose the New Jersey statute,

though, had immunity statute — the public employees immunity
statute — had promised the defendant not to use the compelled
statements ©r the statement that he would ~- his testimony —■
in circumstances in which fcha — against which the Fifth
Amendment -- Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments did not protect

51
the

de fendanfe.
Suppose New Jersey had gone farther than it was

required constitutionally to do.

And then it tried -- it

purported t© violate its agreement or its promise.
Would that b® a federal constitutional issue there?
MR. WILBERT?

I think that would be strictly straight

interpretation of a state statute.
QUESTION s

It would present no federal constitutional

issue?
MR. WILBERT s

I submit it would not.

I don't think

the state of New Jersey ■— I don't think there is a federal
question if we merely limit this to the construction of the
state statute.

The state has the right to interpret its

statute under substantive interpretation of its own
legislation.
There was* by the way# Mr. Justice White# an oral
agreement made in this case,

Mr. Luciani indicating that

you understand# Mr. Respondent;# that none of this testimony —
QUESTION:

I've read — that's what's in the — I've

read that,
MR. WILBERT:
QUESTIONS

It was implied.

BUt if was no different from the statute.

MR. WILBERTs

It really wasn't — it was no different

from the statute.
QUESTION:

It was almost in the terms of the statute.

52
MR. WILBERT:

Except for the use Of the word,

personally.
But it did comply with the public employees immunity
statute, that no use could be made.
I don't think there is any question that the testimony
was compelled in this case under the grant of iinmunity, and
once compelled, it cannot be used for any purpose and —
except for the perjury charge, the subsequent perjury charge.
That’s all that ^^fe9re asking, that not — compelled
testimony not be used to impeach his credibility.
QUESTION:

Could you be indicted under New Jersey

law now for perjury?
MR. WILBERT:

Yes, he could.

The appellate division

made that clear in oral argument that they were reserving the
right to —- and under the statute it’s clear.

The statute

says, it cannot be used in any subsequent rial against the
defendant with the exception of perjury or false swearing.
At the time of this statute, it was merely perjury.
But they

have changed the statute to make it non-self-executing

and include false swearing.
QUESTION:

But your position is, I take it, on

perjury, is that if he had taken the stand at the trial and
testified, and he was either convicted or acquitted, as would
be the case, then his statements on the stand -- his statements
at the grand jury hearing, his previous statements could not be

53
used to convict him ofperjury at the trial.
MR. WILBERT:

The -- I submit the appellate division

found that they could be used.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but your position is --- your

position is that his grand jury statements cannot be used to
convict him of perjury in his testimony at the trial?
MR. WILBERT:

That’s not my contention.

I submit that

he is ~~ he is exposed to a charge of perjury if he testifies,
and testifies untruthfully at trial, the statute —■
QUESTION:

Would ~

MR. WILBERT:

—■ permits the charge of perjury and

allows the statement made at the grand jury to be laid side by
side with his testimony at trial.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought your position was — I

thought your position was that the only perjury that he could
be convicted of would be perjury at the grand jury stage.
MR. WILBERT:

That was not my position, Mr. Justice

White.
I believe that the statute is broad enough in New
Jersey, under the statutory interpretation, to charge him with
perjury in a subsequent trial and to utilise the statements
that he gave against him to show the perjury to a jury.
That is really the problem that we have here.
it does not amount to perjury.
QUESTION:

The —

His testimony --

Well, then I don’t -- I’m sorry.

I just

54
don't understand why you think it’s even — that it's any more
a violation of the statute to use his grand jury testimony at
the trial to show that he is lying.
Because a day — if a day later in a perjury prosecution
related to what he testified to at trial, you could introduce
his prior grand jury testimony.
MR. WILBERT:

That3s the '-.real problem in this case,

because there was no contention that he had perjured hisuself
at the grand jury.

It was conceded that his testimony was

trustworthy and truthful.
And I submit the use of the testimony at fcne trial
was not going to go to perjury, but was merely going to go
to the vagaries of memory between the time elapsed, and other
inconsistencies that might in tha jury's mind indicate that
this man was being less than crediblej without even reaching
the question of perjury they were attempting to use it.
And that's the real problem that we have in the case.
They were violating his rights to take the stand, to use to
impeach, without even — I contend — hoping to obtain perjury.
I have no other points, unless there are any other
questions.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:09 o'clock, p.m. , the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
