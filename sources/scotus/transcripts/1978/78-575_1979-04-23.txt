PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-575, Southern Railway v. Seaboard and the crorr-,solidated cases.
Mr. Evans, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 78-597
MR. EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It please

the Court:
These consolidated cases are here on certiorari
to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

They pre­

sent a discrete Issue of reviewability — are the courts
empo-wered to review an ICC decision not to investigate a
proposed railroad rate change before the cl-iange takes
effect.
The Court of Appeals held that such a decision is
reviewable and we argue that it is not.

The case started

in August 1977 when the Southern Railroads filed tariffs
:

proposing a 20 percent seasonal increase on the rates for
the transportation of grain in the southern territory.
The tariff was to last for three months, and it was among
the first of the tariffs filed under the 1576 legislation
which directed the Commission to allow the filing of such
demand sensitive rates.

5
The purpose of the statute was to give shippers
an incentive to reduce peak period transportation and to
better use the national car pool of railroad freight cars.
Several groups of shippers, including the respondents here,
filed protests with the Commission, arguing that the in­
creases violated

a variety of sections of the Act, and

they asked the Commission to suspend and investigate the
rates under section 15.

The Commission decided not to

suspend or investigate, essentially for two reasons.
First, it was not convinced that the shippers had
made convincing arguments on the merits of their claims of
unlawfulness; and, second, because the Commission wanted to
carry out the congressional policy of creating a. regulatory
climate that would be conducive to this kind of experi­
mentation in railroad ratemaking.
The shippers filed a petition for review in the
Court of Appeals'for the Eighth Circuit.

They sought and

got a stay from the court for approximately eight days
which enjoined the railroads from collecting the rates
during that period.
The Coart of Appeals declined to review the
Commission’s decision not to suspend the rates, but it held
that it could review the decision not to investigate the
rates, a decision that it characterized as a termination
of an investigation into the lawfulness of the rates.

6
The Court of Appeals reasoned that the shippers
had made substantial allegations that the tariffs were
patently unlawful, that the Commission had a duty to in­
vestigate, and that its, what it referred to as a premature
termination of the investigation was improper.

The decision

was in conflict with the decision of the District of
Columbia Circuit, which had held unreviewable a Commission
decision not to investigate under section 15 of the Act.
The key to the case I believe is in the structure
of the Act’s rate investigation and complaint procedures.
There are two ways that the Commission can investigate a
*

railroad rate.

Under section 15» it has the power before

the effectiveness of the rate to Institute an investigation
and during that period to suspend the rate for up to seven
or ten months, depending on whether it seeks an extension
of time, pending completion of the investigation.
If it decides against instituting a section 15
investigation, anyone can complain under section 13 and
the Commission must investigate in response to that complaint
QUESTION:

Am I right in thinking, Mr. Evans, that

under a section 13 complaint, the Commission doesn’t simply
sit as an adjudicator but it has an affirmative duty to
investigate?
MR. EVANS:
proceeding.

It must investigate, it must begin a

It is in effect an adjudicator of the proceeding

7
that is basically a dispute between the complaining party
on the one hand and the carrier on the other.
QUESTION:

But can it just sit back and say you

two contestants bring your evidence before me and we will
decide, or does it have to participate in the investigation?
MR. EVANS:

No, I think it is more the former.

It does not necessarily actively participate in the in­
vestigation but, by the same token,, of course, it has the
power to develop the record if the record is not being
adequately developed.

But investigation is a term that was

used in the original Act.

Really, in the recodifieation,

it has been changed to the word proceeding, it is a pro­
ceeding before the agency and it can be instituted either
on its own motion, in which case there may not be a com- •'
plaining party and in which case it would cevelon the
record, or it could be instituted in response to a complaint.
QUESTION:

So the investigation is the same under

either 13 or 15?
MR. EVANS:

Essentially the same.

several procedural differences.

There are

The burden of proof with

respect to some issues is on the carrier in a section 15
case, that is the one that would be instituted in advance
of the rates’ effectiveness.

On the question of whether

the rates are reasonable, that is are they high enough or
too high, the carrier there bears the burden of going

8
forward with the evidence.
remains the same.

As to other issues, the burden

In either proceeding, the burden of

going forward with initial showing on questions such as
discrimination or violations of the long-and-short haul
clause, which are the issues that we have in this case,
rest with the shippers.
There are some differences in the result of a
proceeding.

In a section 15 proceeding, the commission

may order refunds if it finds that the rates are unjusti­
fied.

In a section 13 proceeding, the result is damages

in favor of the shipper if he can demonstrate that he has
been financially injured by the unlawful rate.

And there

are slightly different statutory time limits that govern
the proceedings.

Under section 15; the Commission is

under an obligation to complete the proceeding in seven
months, with a possible three-month extension.

There is

not that same statutory limit in a section 13 proceeding,
but there are some internal — some procedural limits
within the proceeding itself.
QUESTION:.

Mr. Evans, can you help me on one

perhaps awfully narrow question.

Under a section 15 pro­

ceeding, and focusinp; on the word "investigate," does the
word investigate refer to what the Commission should do
before it decides whether or not to suspend, or does it
refer to the examination made after there is a suspension?

9
MR. EVANS:

It refers to the examination made

after the suspension or after the decision to investigate.
That is critical to this case because the Court of Anneals
as I mentioned characterized what the Commission did here
as a premature termination of an investigation.

The term

"Investigation” as it is used in the statute -- the statute
has been recodified, the word Is now "proceeding" — what
it means is the process that can lead to a final judgment
on the final order of the Commission adjudicating the
lawfulness of the rates.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn’t it always follow that

if the Commission has decided not to suspend, it has also
necessarily decided not to investigate?

t

_

MR. EVANS:

No, quite the reverse, Mr. Justice.

In order *—

}

QUESTION:

Then your answer was misleading, your

■■

first answer to my Brother Stevens.
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MH. EVANS:

I’m sorry.
That is wh&t has got me confused.
I’m sorry.

The decision of whether

to investigate and suspend is simultaneous.

A rate is

filed, it Is up to the Commission In response to protest
to decide whether first of all to conduct an Investigation
Into the rate.

If It decides that it will investigate at

that stage, before the rate’s effectiveness, it may but

10

need not also suspend the effectiveness of the rates for
up to seven months.
QUESTION:

So an investigation may be for the

purpose of determining whether or not to suspend?
MR. EVANS:

No.

Maybe I am not being clear.

The suspension happens at the outset.

A suspension is

basically an injunction, a temporary Injunction pending a
final decision.

The final decision is the result of the

investigation.

The suspension carries with the investi­

gation and terminates at the end of the investigation.
QUESTION:

But there must be some ratiocination

leading to a decision of whether or not to investigate?
MR. EVANS:

Yes, it is a very rapid, necessarily

so, very rapid decision at the administration stage.

The

rates come in, the tariffs come out — I brought along
some tariffs just so you could see what we are talking
about.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

And protests come In, don’t they?
— protests come in

tariffs

have to be filed with at least 30 days notiee.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

Right.
A tariff comes in, a protest must

be in under the rules by twelve days before the effective
date.

The carrier can reply to the protest by the fourth

working day before the effectiveness of the rate.

By the

11
third working day before the effectiveness of the rate,
the Commission’s suspension board makes a judgment whether
it will investigate and suspend or investigate or suspend,
QUESTION:

There has to be some sort of an ap­

praisal, doesn't there?
MR. EVANS:

There is an appraisl.

rapid informal assessment.

It is a very

It is not, in answer to Mr.

Justice Stevens’ question, an investigation is that phrase
as used within the statute.
QUESTION:
one thing,

But you still have me confused about

It still seems to me that if the investigation

under the statute is the post-suspension proceeding, neces­
sarily a decision not to suspend would include a decision
not to investigate.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

Yes, Isn’t it?
I am not making this clear, I guess.

The decision — let me put it this way:

It is possible

for the Commission to investigate without suspending.
cannot suspend without investigating.

It

In ether word3, the

suspension -— the purpose of the suspension is much like a
preliminary injunction.

You are holding the rate off

while you are investjgating,

if you have no Investigation,

there is no reason to suspend, there is no foundation for
a suspension.
QUESTION:

There are two kinds of Investigations,

12
In other words?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
can refer to

Yes — I’m sorry?
The word investigate under the statute

two different kinds of investigat ionss one,

a post-suspension investigation, and alternatively an in­
vestigation without —
MR. EVANS.

Without suspension, precisely.

is the came Investigation.

It

It is Just in one case the

Commission feels it necessary to hold the rate from being
effective, and in the other case it is willing to let it
come into effect.
QUESTION:

Since you analogize it to an injunc­

tion, is it the same, broadly the same kind of discretion
to be exercised by the board as a court of equity would
exercise?
MR. EVANS:
Justice.

Even broader, I believe, Mr. Chief

There are no statutory standards that govern the

■exercise of the suspension and investigation authority.
The statute is simply the Commission may investigate and
may suspend.

There are very clear statutory standards

that come into play in response to a section 13 complaint.
There the Commission must investigate, it has no discre­
tion unless it finds that the complaint is completely
without substance.
QUESTION:

You say that the discretion is broader

13
in part because they have an absolutely fail-safe way of
protecting everybody?
MR. EVANS:

In effect, that is right.

A shipper

who seeks unsuccessfully to have a rate investigated at the
outset can just turn around the next day and file a com­
plaint and secure an investigation.

He can compel it.

What the respondents In this case did was go to court.
They could have simply filed a complaint with the Commis­
sion the next day and the investigation probably would be
over by

-w.

The Commission’s discretion at that stage is

even broader than a court’s because it is not limited to
questions of likely harm and so forth.

That is clearly

part of the suspension board’s consideration.

They con­

sider questions like is it likely that this rate

is going

to be found unlawful, is it likely that the; public is going
to be significantly harmed.

But It also takes into account

things like the availability of Commission resources for
the investigation, and It takes into account things like
the overriding congressional policy that the Commission
found decisive here.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you one other question.

If there is an Investigation pursuant to section 15, not
section 13, the burden I take it Is on the carriers to
demonstrate the lawfulness of the rate?
MR.

EVANS:

It is a little bit narrower than

14
that, Mr. Justice.

The burden is on the carrier to demon

strate the reasonableness of the rates.

Now, there are

other issues embraced tfith the phrase "lawfulness.,r
QUESTION:

But my other question was, in such a

proceeding are reparations a possible form of relief?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Well —
Assume at the end of the proceeding

it was determined that the rate had been unreasonable and
excessive.
MR, EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

In a section 15 case —
A section 15 case.
— th® remedy is normally refunds.

In fact, the statute requires refunds.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

I see.
If the Commission finds that the

rates were unjustified.

Now, that doesn't always happen.

Sometimes the Commission can find that the rates were not
shown to be Just and reasonable, were not shown to be
lawful, in which case the remedy might not be refunds.
But refunds are an available remedy.
The Court of Appeals in this case went wrong,
I believe, for basically three reasons.

First, we have

discussed, it characterised the Commission's decision In
this case as a termination of investigation.
the investigation was never begun.

In fact,

That is critical

15

because in this Court’s decision in the City of Chicago
case, that distinction was of decisive significance.

The

Court held there that a Commission decision terminating an
investigation of the unlawfulness of a train discontinuance
was reviewable because it was a decision on the merits,
just like any other decision on the merits.
time, it stated in that case

At the same

the corollary principle

that the Commission need not Institute the investigation.
That matter, according to the Court, was a matter committed
to the agency's discretion and not reviewable.
The second error the court made was that it
*.

seemed to think that section 13, the complaint procedures
under section 13 would not be aval]able for certain categories of claims.

That is just not the case.

Any issue

of the lawfulness of the rates can be raised in a section
.’ i

■

■

•

13 complaint just as it could in a section 15 proceeding.
And finally it believes that the decision of the
Commission not to investigate was tantamount to a finding
that the ratos were lawful, and that is not the case.
This Court held as much In the first SCRAP decision, that
refusal to investigate leaves the rates fully subject to
complaint and investigation and forecloses no argument as
to the lawfulness.
I began to point to these tariffs I brought along
here to illustrate the kind of thing the Commission deals

16
with.

I asked the tariff people to give me a sampling, a

tariff (Illustrating).
the middle one.

That is one

That is about average, I am told,

That is a small one (illustrating).

The

Commission receives 52,000 of these a year, roughly, and
it considers for suspension and investigation in response
to protests a far smaller number.

But even so, there are

within each tariff maybe one or two but as many as
thousands of individual rate changes.

This is a mammoth

undertaking.
The Commission examines all the tariffs that it
receives and when it receives protests it considers the
issues of lawfulness that are raised.

But these are the

kinds of judgments that are being made rapidly in the
face of a day after getting the railroad's reply.

They are

the kind of judgments that are made basically from gut,
because it is just impossible to deal more effectively at
that stage than from the gut.

And in our view, that is

not the kind of a decision that the courts are very well
equipped to undertake review of.
There are a number of —
QUESTION:

Mr. Evans, I assume that your position

in the Court of Appeals, that is the ICC's position is
different than that taken by the Department of Justice
there?

17
MR. EVANS:

Yes, the Department of Justice

argued there that the decision of the Commission was reviewable then, right there in that court.

In fact, much

of the Court of Appeals oDinlon is a reflection of the
brief that was submitted by the Department of Justice in
that case.

We have been consistent.
QUESTION:

Did the government just develop its

esoteric theory in this Court?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
It is quite d5,fferent from its posi­

tion below.
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Quite different, yes.
I take it from your answer to Justice

Rehnquist that you think it is esoteric.

Well, I —

yourself?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?
You wish you had thought of it

yourself ?
MR, EVANS:

Yes.

I had a few others.

The one

18

I used was euriously cumbersome,
I Just want to make one other point and that Is
that the respondents5 arguments here really hinge on a
notion that these rates are patently obviously ridiculously
unlawful and their whole argument hinges on the Court’s
willingness to make that finding.

It is really trying to

drag —- they are really trying to drag this Court into the
merits of the case even before they have given the Commis­
sion an opportunity to address those merits finally.
There is doubt about the lawfulness notwithstand­
ing what they will tell you and I respectfully suggest that
the Court need not enter the matter until the Commission
has spoken.
Thank you.
Ms, Poynter.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP WANDALEEN POYNTER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN' NO. 78-604
MS. POYNTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As a representative of the railroads, I would
like to approach essentially and very emphatically the
overriding public policy problems as well as the congres­
sional mandate avoidance problems, if you will, that we
will face if — and I do adopt completely the position
that the Commission has taken in this regard that the

19
court below has simply intruded, it is a classic example
of an intrusion into an administrative proceeding.

They

absolutely took this case, they entered a suspension as
only the Commission has the authority to do under 15(B),
and as this Court has held emphatically completely anart
from court interference.

They ther. proceeded to take every

step available under section 15(8) to the Commission.
They made a determination on the weight of the evidence,
they issued a refund order, and they then proceeded to set
an investigation.

They literally remanded to the Commis­

sion and said to the Commission, ycu will investigate and
you will make findings on two specific areas.
In 1976, Congress passed the Railroad Revitali­
zation and Regulatory Reform Act and withir that, as the
Commission has indicated, were provisions which drastically
changed the rate-making regulation allowed to the Commission
and in most instances definitely decreased the authority
that the Commission had to step in, especially at a preeffective stage to literally interfere with railroad-made
rates.
Carrier Initiation of rates is an absolute.
There is only the suspension stage which interferes with
carrier initiation of rates.

One of the provisions liras a

provision allowing the publication of demand sensitive
rate3.

The allegations which have been made of patent

20
illegalities by the protestants were desperate attempts,
literally eleventh hour attempts on the part of one of the
protestants simply to get before a court to avoid the
restrictions that have been placed by Congress within
15(B), including

and I address a question which was

initially requested of Mr. Evans

the suspension stage

is more like a petition for a stay to a court at this
particular time than it was prior to February of 1976,
because indeed now a complainant tc the Commission request­
ing that a rate be suspended or investigated or both must
show that there is a possibility of substantial harm and
that there i3 a likelihood that the complainant will pre­
vail on the merits.
Neither of the complainants represented before
this Court today did that.

In seeking appeal to the Eighth

Circuit, the complainants in essence avoided their recourse
through the Commission and misled the court in a sense by
requesting suspension on patent illegalities when it had
not been proved to the Commission.

The court below mis­

construed what the complainants were saying to the court,
and that is where we find ourselves today before chia
Court.
If the lower court decision is not reversed, it
literally will open flood gates to allow shippers to avoid
the restrictions that have now been placed against them by

21
Congress by allowing what is equivalent to a pre-1910
situation where the courts will be telling the Commission
when they will and when they will not investigate and in
what time.
The most compelling example of this is the posi­
tion represented to this Court today by the Chicago Board
of Trade and its eo-responding parties.

They have simply

alleged simple violations of two sections of the Interstate
Commerce Act ifhlch deal with discriminatory or prejudicial
practices,

most definitely areas with which only the

Commission if? qualified to act.
If the lower court decision is upheld, it will
only be necessary for a complainant to go before the Com­
mission and to make any allegation of patent illegality
and then put that before an appeals court for the court to
decide whether they have raised a substantial question or
not, not to allow the Commission to make that determination.
Thank you.
MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Ms. Pynter.

Mr. Allen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. ALLEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT, UNITED STATES
MR, ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The United States in this case is urging a position

22

that agrees in some respects and disagrees in other respects
with both sides in this controversy.
First, we agree with the Commission that the
Court of Appeals did not have jurisdiction to review the
Commission’s decision in this case essentially because in
our view the Commission’s decision was not a final decision,
that is reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act,
and because the complaining shippers had net exhausted
their administrative remedies.

In that respect, we

disagree with the Court of Appeals and vrith the complaining
\

shippers.
Second, however, we disagree with the Commission's
position that its decision not to conduct an investigation
under section 15 is never judieally reviewable.

We submit

that that decision may be judicially reviewed after the
Commission has made a final decision on the lawfulness of
rates under a section 13 proceeding that any aggrieved
shipper can compel the Commission to undertake under the
statute.
QUESTION:
case?

Do we need to decide that in this

Is it inevitable that w® must decide it?
MR. ALLEN:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, it is

inevitable that you decide it or I think it is directly -QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

In this case?
In this ease — perhaps not absolutely

23
necessary, but in order to determine and to conclude, as
we submit you should, that the Court of Appeals had no
jurisdiction in this case, there are two alternative
theories for accepting that.

The first theory is the

Commission’s theory that this is simply one of those kind
of agency actions that is committed to agency discretion
/

by lav/ and therefore under the Administrative Procedure
Act is wholly immune from judicial review at any time.
The other position is cur position, which is
quite different, which is that it is not one of those kinds
of actions but, rather, the Court of Appeals lacked juris­
diction on finality principles and failure to exhaust
’administrative remedies.
Our position is based on our view that under the
particular scheme of the Interstate Commerce Act, the
principle consequence of the Commission's decision not to
conduct an investigation under section 15 is to shift the
burden of proof on the question of the lawfulness of rates
from carriers, where it would be under section 15, to
shippers where it would be under section 13.

That conse­

quence is expressly provided for by in the Act and it is an
important aspect of the scheme of the Act, as this Court
has recognised in a number of decisions.
If the Commission conducts an investigation,
decides to conduct an investigation under section 15, that

2H
section expressly provides that the burden of proof is on
the carrier to show that the proposed change in rates is
just and reasonable.

If the Commission does not investigate

under section 15, any aggrieved shipper can file a complaint
under section 13 and compel the Commission to adjudicate the
lawfulness of the rates, but in that case the burden is on
the complaining shipper to show that the rates are unlawful.
I would like to state briefly our reasons for
agreeing with the Commission that the Court of Appeals was
wrong in reviewing this case and devote the preponderance
of my time to the point in which we disagree with the
Commission.
The Commission’s decision not to investigate
under section 15 was not reviewable by the Court of Appeals
in our view because it was not a final decision within the
meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act and within the
meaning of 28 United States Court, section 23^2(5), which
gives the Courts of Appeals jurisdiction to review final
orders of the Commission.
Contrary to the Court of Appeals, the Commission’s
decision not to investigate under section 15 did not con­
stitute either expressly or in effect a determination on
the lawfulness of the proposed rate change.

The statute

gives shippers an adequate remedy in section 13 to compel
the Commission to decide the lav/fulness of the rates and

25
the Administrative Procedure Act and princip3.es of exhaus­
tion of administrative remedies require sh5.ppers to use and
employ that procedure before they can invoice judicial
review,
QUESTION:

You don't think that

Arrow and SCRAP

then are the cases that control this particular aspect of
the case?
MR. ALLEN:

No, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, we do not

because we do perceive a distinction between the review of
a decision not to investigate and the review of a decision
not to suspend a rate.

In Arrow ar.d SCRAP,, the Court

explained that decisions of the Commission not to suspend
a rate were not r©viewable but for very particular and
persuasive reasons that were evident in the statutory
scheme.
QUESTION:

The Congress just hadn't intended

them to be.
MR. ALLEN:

Congress had not intended them to be

revlewable because the suspension power itself was enacted
to prevent the -practice that had previously occurred of
District Courts enjoining rates and therefore creating a
great disparity in rates contrary to the national transpor­
tation policy.
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't it follow, if Congress

had not intended review of the suspension power, it would

26
likeitfise not have intended review of the authority to in»
vestigate preliminary to suspension?
MR, ALLEN:

We believe not, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, as Mr. Evans explained.

The power to investi­

gate is not necessarily a power preliminary to a decision
to investigate.

It is a power that is exercised at the

same time or even Independently.

The Commission can refuse

to suspend a rate and nevertheless investigate its lawful­
ness under section 15» In which the carriers have the
burden of proof.

They can suspend a rate end still in­

vestigate under section 15.

It doesn't conduct the inves­

tigation before it decides whether to suspend or not to
suspend.
QUESTION:

I suppose there is something in the

nature of or at least analogous to probable easue that
enters Into the thinking at that stage?
MR. ALLEN:

Perhaps analogous, perhaps analogous.

There are circumstances, as I will explain in a minute» in
which there can be easily imagined they are not extremely
far fetched in which tli© Commission's decision not to eon\

duct an investigation would be we think plainly contrary
to the statute or plainly arbitrary and capricious.
have given some examples in our brief.

We

But for the present

let me outline the precise reasons that we disagree with
the Commission's position.

27

As I said* we agree that the Court of Appeals
did not have jurisdiction to review this case.

Nov?, the

Commission goes further and contends that its decision not
to Investigate is never subject to judicial review even
after a final decision by the Commission on the merits of
the lawfulness of rates, because. In the Commission’s view
the decision not to investigate is one of those actions
which under the Administrative Procedure Act Is committed
to agency discretion by law and therefore wholly unreviewable, according to the logic of the Commission’s positions
therefore It believes that Its discretion not to investigate
is analogous to the discretion of a public prosecutor not
to investigate or prosecute someone for violations of
criminal law.

With that proposition, we strongly disagree.

And I would like to emphasize two points in con­
nection with our disagreement.

The first Is that we beli®ve

that the Commission’s position is contrary to general and
Important principles that this Court has established deter­
mining the availability of judicial review of the adminis­
trative action.
The second point I want to make is that while it
may be that there will not be a practical difference or
that there will be little practical difference between our
position and the Commission’s position in most cases, there
may be some eases In which it is a significant practical

28
consequence, and we believe that an example of the kind of
case where it may make a difference has already been before
this Court in the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Pe Railway v.
Wichita Board of Trade ease, 412 U.S., and is discussed in
our brief at pages 35 through 37.
With respect to the first point, this Court has
established and it has stated in many cases that the
Administrative Procedure Act establishes a strong presump­
tion in favor of judicial review of administrative action,
and there are only two circumstances in which review can
be precluded,

first, where a statute expressly precludes

review or, second, where the statutory scheme provides
some particular and persuasive reason why rev let* would not
be appropriate.
In this case, so long as review is deferred until
after a Commission decision on the merits of rates under
section 13, which is reviewable in a court in any event,
there is nothing in the scheme of the Interstate Commerce
Act that would indicate that that reviex? of the no investi­
gation decision is inappropriate, and the Commission has
cited nothing in the purposes or procedures of the Act that
xfould be undermined by review of a no investigation decision
in the context of the normal judicial review of final
Commission decisions.

Accordingly, we think that rejection

of the Commission’s position is impoartant as a matter of

29
general principles.
With respect to my second, point, there may be , as
I have said, little practical difference between our posi­
tion and the Commission's in most eases.

We believe that

— we think that the Commission's discretion in this matter
is quite broad, although not unlimited, and there may be
and probably are very few cases in which a court could
ultimately find that the Commission had abused its discretion
in not investigating a rate and yet in which at the same
time the Commission in a section 13 proceeding found that
the complaining shippers had not met their burden of showing
that the rates were unlawful.
QUESTION:

You have to equate action and non­

action to sustain your position, don't you?
MR. ALLEN:

Yes, you do, Mr, Chief Justice, and

I think this Court has equated action and non-action in
the past.

I think the Chicago Beard of Trade case can be

viewed as an example of that.

In any event, there is no

principle which I can perceive for saying that action and
non-action are different in terms of judicial reviewability.
QUESTION:

Mr. Allen, is there a time within which

a section 13(1) proceeding must be commenced?
MR, ALLEN:
QUESTION:

No, not In the statute.
So under your analysis a decision not

to Investigate never becomes final unless such a proceeding

30

was sometime or other commenced3 because there would always
be a potentiality that such a proceeding could be commenced
and terminated and that would have the effect of making
final the earlier decision by the Commission not to investi­
gate.

That is your theory, isn’t it?
MR. ALLEN:

In a sense I suppose that Is true,

although it is very far-fetched and. unrealistic, a ease in
which it might b© that a section 13 proceeding was initiated
years after the Commission had declined to investigate the
tariff over the protests of complaining shippers.
QUESTION:

I suppose it i’s about equally probable

as — you say there is little practical difference between
your position and —
MR. ALLEN:

Probably in most cases, but it is by

no means far-fetched to imagine cases in which it might be
of practical significance.

We have given examples in err

brief, hypothetic.als where the Commission fails to investigate for solely and for manifestly 'erroneous legal reasons
or because, for example, they -QUESTION:

Isn't there another way to dispose of

along the lines suggested by the Chief Justice, to say that
even assuming; that the matter is not entirely committed to
the discretion of the Commission, nevertheless the order
was plainly not final and we don't have to reach the question.

31
MR. ALLEN:

Yes, I think the Court could do that

and we would agree that it has —
QUESTION:

So it really isn't necessary to decide

the difficult question you argue.
MR, ALLEN:
question.

It is not necessary to decide that

We would be perfectly happy with a decision that

says whatever the ultimate reviewability, it is not final at
this time.
QUESTION:

You just want to keep your foot in the

door for a future development.
MR, ALLEN:

Whether or not that would be appro­

priate as a matter of sound judicial administration Is more
your question than mine.
QUESTION:

Even If your foot isn't in the door,

you would like to have the door left open.
MR, ALLEN:

Well, certainly that is true, too,

Mr. Justice,
My last point though Is that It is not far-fetched
to Imagine such cases and in our view a good example Is the
situation that has already confronted this Court in the
Wichita Board of Trade case.

And although the posture of

that case was somewhat different, we think that it does
stand In principle for the proposition that we support,
namely that no investigation decisions are subject to
judicial review for an abuse of discretion.

We have

32
discussed that ease in our brief and I rely on that discussion9 unless there are any questions from the Court.
Thank you very much.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. CALDWELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS, SEABOARD
MILLING CORPORATION, ET AL.
MR. CALDWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the'Court:
The respondents feel as 3f there are two separate
cases that are being presented to this Court — or maybe
♦

'three cases, the c&so being argued by the United States,

'

'

;

in an abrupt change of its position, the United States,
have all repeatedly mischaracteriaed this case as only in­
volving a routine normal determination not to suspend or
investigate under section 15(3).

What happened, however,

was a far different situation.
What happened was an unprecedented abuse of
statutory authority in the form of Commission action taken
in opposition to the clearly stated requirements of section

33
4(1) and contrary to the absolute prohibition of that
section in that rates were approved to become binding and
effective and harmful on all segments of the public with­
out compliance with the clearly stated requirements of
section 4.
Mow, what this case is is an abuse of statutory
authority of an unprecedented nature under section 4(1),
an example of statutory misinterpretation by the Commission
that approval of rates as effective and binding on a final
basis and an issuance of orders notably lacking an irrational
basis or findings.
What the case is not is —
QUESTION:

This point that you just made, not the

one that you are just about to make, is It something that
would be apparent on the face of the proceedings?
MR. CALDWELL:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

It is

apparent from the face of the orders that were issued by
the Commission and reviewed by the court in that the Com­
mission failed to resolve the allegations that the rates on
their face were patently illegal and could not be permitted
to be put into effect —
QUESTION:

Is that allegation one capable of be­

ing resolved simply on the face of your pretest without
some sort of investigation?
MR. CALDWELL:

It can be easily and could have

been easily resolved by a mere examination of the face of
the tariffs that had been filed by the carriers with the
railroads and should have been resolved when the allegation
’was made by our side that the rates on their face should
not be allowed to take effect because they were substantively a nullity in that they contained long-and-short haul
departures.
Now, there is a distinction between the kind of
appraisal I just referred to and a subsequent 15(8) type of
investigation.

Our position in this case is that the auto­

matic prohibition of section 4(1) was triggered when we
made our allegation and provided substantial examples that
the tariffs on their face were invalid.
QUESTION:

Okay.

You use the words "substantial

examples that the tariffs on their face were invalid.”

Is

it your position that the ICC could simply by having looked
at the tariffs and looked at the section of the statute
you rely on concluded without any further factual investi­
gation that the tariffs ware invalid?
MR. CALDWELL:
Honor.

That is absolutely correct. Your

The statute, section 4(1), prohibits the establish­

ment of tariffs that contain on their face this mathematical
relationship of longer or greater charges for shorter
distance and longer distance over the same route of haul.
In effect, the Commission ignored the statutory

35
prohibition.

It was a very simple and very easy task for

it to have its tariff people to simply look at the tariffs,
even in the absence of any demonstrated violations docu­
mented such as we have documented and quickly have deter­
mined that these tariffs contain long-and-short haul de­
partures.

Instead, the Commission merely turned its head

and said that it would not reject and it said it would make
no findings and leave unresolved the question of whether on
their face these tariffs were substantively invalid in
violation of the clearly stated prohibition.
QUESTION:

How many pages did the tariffs consist

of?
MR. CALDWELL:

I don’t know, Your Honor, the

exact number of pages, but it was not a substantially dif­
ficult job for the Commission to evaluate the tariffs.

As

a matter of fact, the pleadings which were evaluated by the
Commission in this case were about half the size of the
yellow pages of the Washington phone book.

If the Commis­

sion was capable of analysing and digesting that material,
it certainly could have had its tariff people look at the
tariffs.
QUESTION:

You mean the pleadings were half the

size of the yellow pages of the Washington phone book?
MR. CALDWELL:

This was the approximate size of

the pleadings that were filed and resolved and digested by

36
the Commission prior to its action authorising the tafiffs
to take effect.

This is the appendix —

QUESTION:

They are supposed to do that in four

days?
MR. CALDWELL:

They do it in — in this case,

Your Honor, they did it in I think a little more than four
days, but they — this is not an. unusual section 4(1)
prohibition.

We provided specifically unccnfcroverted ex­

amples that on the face of these tariffs they contain
violations of the clause.
QUESTION:

As I understand, the Commission still

doesn’t agree with you on that.
MR. CALDWELL:

Your Honor, neither the Commission

nor the —
QUESTION:

Do they or not?

MR. CALDWELL:

I don’t know what the Commission’s

position is.
QUESTION:

Well, they haven’t agreed with you ~

MR, CALDWELL:

They haven't agreed that there

were violations —
QUESTION:

They haven’t agreed with you, even

after all this time, after reading everything you’ve ever
said about it, they still haven't agreed with you.
MR. CALDWELL:

Because apparently they have

never had their tariff people look at the face of the

37
tariffs.

They haven’t denied our position.

The Commission

and the railroads have not denied that these rates contain
violations on their face.
QUESTION:

Mr. Caldwell, if it is all that clear,

could you not file a 13(1) proceeding and get prompt relief?
MR. CALDWELL:

No, sir, we could not, Your Honor,

for a number of reasons.

First of all, the Commission does

not grant refunds in section 13 proceedings for violation
by itself of its own statutory mandate.

It simply will not

do that.
QUESTION:

It concedes tfrat there is no —

MR. CALDWELL:

We could not have obtained the

sort of review we sought in the court here by submitting
a section 13 complaint.

The Commission would not agree in

that proceeding that it had allowed Illegally established
tariffs to.become effective.
exercise on our part.

That would nave been a futile

Secondly, the Commission historically

does not grant refunds in section 13 complaint cases for
section 4 violations of the Act.
QUESTION:

You are saying it is perfectly obvious

there is a violation, but you are saying because the
Commission exercises discretion not to suspend and not to
investigate, even though the patent violation were dis­
closed to the Commission, as a matter of pride would they
rule that way?

Why would they rule that way if —

38
MR. CALDWELL:

As a matter of case history, the

Commission takes the position that over-charges and refunds
cannot be established in a section

proceeding.

In their

reply brief, Your Honor, they even state that over-charges
are alien — and that is the word they use — alien to the
concept of a section 13 complaint proceeding.

Historically,

the Commission takes the position that if you file a section

13 complaint, you must establish that the rates are un­
reasonable and violate some other section of the Act beyond
section k*

So even under their own case precedent and long-

established history, by processing a section 13 complaint
case we could have obtained no relief.
QUESTION:

Well, both the United States and the

Commission have represented to us that the issue you want
to raise would be open in a section 13 proceeding, and you
are tailing us they are misrepresenting the —
MR. CALDWELL:

That’s correct, they are.

They

are misrepresenting in the sense that we could obtain
refunds for over-charges in a section 13 ecmpl&int case,
\

and we so cited eases to that effect.
QUESTION:

Well, if this Is your objection, the

United States position would take care of you.
MR. CALDWELL:
QUESTION:

No, sir, the United States —

Because they would go back and say

that they should have investigated.

39
MR. CALDWELL:

The United States position is that

we would now have to file section 13 complaints and then if
we were unsuccessful we would have to go back to court and
at that time obtain a review of the? failure to investigate
and
QUESTION:

They would say that the decision not

to investigate was wrong and that would put you back in
the position as if the Commission had been investigating.
If the Commission had investigated here and found the
rates shouldn't be filed but hadn’t suspended them, there
would be a refund.
MR. CALDWELL:

If they had investigated and had

not suspended, there would have been refunds available.

is that this -is not a section 15(8) case involving Commis­
sion discretion to suspend or to investigate.

This'is a

section 4 case, of the type decided in the Mechling
decisions of this Court and the type decided in the Seaboard
Allied case before the Western District of Missouri, where
the Commission is violating on the face of the statute, the
prohibition by refusing to reject or suspend or, for that
matter Investigate tariffs that were invalid on their face.
Now, I think the important thing the Court must

40
understand is that in a very coy way the railroads have
never denied that these departures exist.

They are either

in the tariffs or they aren’t in the tariffs.

The rail­

roads have the obligation to clear them out of the tariffs
before they file them or file special applications for pre­
effectiveness permission to make those tariffs effective.
The carriers have never denied that these departures exist
on the face of the tariffs, nor for that matter has the
Commission made such a denial.
Now, this case had other unusual aspects about
it beyond the fact that it involved a section 4(1) prohi­
bition.

It Involves a special increase under a specially

delegated power from the Congress in section 15(17).

It

Involves rates that were proposed at a time of the year
when affected shippers had no alternative but to pay the
rates and ship and suffer the injury that was caused by
i

the unlawful rates.

There was a unique method of process­

ing the case by the Commission, contrary to the normal
15(7) or 15(0) type procedure.

The jCommission established

a formal docket number and assigned it to the case.

It

assigned the case to processing by the full Commission
and by Division 2 of the Commission.

And finally and most

importantly, it issued two formal written orders In which
it purported to make findings on various issues but in
effect brushed aside the section 4(1) issues.

41
It is our position that the Commission in effect
has abrogated it3 responsibility in enforcing section 4(1)
and that this was found by the lower court and was the
reason vrhy the lower court ordered the case back to the
Commission for completion of the investigation.
I want to emphasize that the investigation the
Commission should have made was one prior to allowing these
rates to take effect.
could

They were not self-executing, they

not be allowed to take effect until these departures

were either cleared out of the tariffs or the carriers ob­
tained permission for those violations.
QUESTION:

Do you say this court intervention is

permissible only when a violation of 4(1) is claimed?
MR. CALDWELL:

I would say it is permissible

whenever there is a statutory violation, and I would say
that the court should have the power to intervene whenever
the Commission is violating either its own regulations or
an organic statute which occurred in this ease.
QUESTION:

Well, you can allege that at any time.

MR. CALDWELL:

It doesn’t leave any room for

What about reparations, don’t the

reparations take care of curing the unwanted condition?
MR. CALDWELL:

They do not, Ycur Honor, because,

the Commission id.ll not grant refunds.

It would grant

reparations only in the event a shipper could establish
unlawfulness under other sections o? the Act, other than
section 4, and the Commission’s

cases clearly show that it

filed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continue, Mr.

Caldwell.
MR. CALDWELL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I would like to take the remaining amount of time
to answer a question that was raised by Mr. Justice White
before the recess and also deal on a few other remaining
points.
Mr. Justice White inquired whether under our in­
terpretation of the statute it would be necessary for the
ICC to issue or render findings on any violation alleged
in the Interstate Commerce Act.

That?s not our position.

The point here, Your Honor, that this is not
just an allegation of unlawfulness that can be rendered
or determined In a post-effectiveness investigation.

This

was an allegation that the tariffs were not -- could not
be allowed to take effect because of the clear language of
section 4 which prescribes any of those tariffs from
becoming effective
QUESTION:
that effect, you say

Well, any allegation tfhieh would have
the ICC would have to rule on?

MR. CALDWELL:

Our case is based on the section

4 prohibition —
QUESTION:

Yes?

MR. CALDWELL:

-- which is organic to the

Interstate Commerce Act, and to that extent the Commission
cannot let rates take effect which contain those violations
on their face.

Now, as far as other violations of the Act

are concerned —
QUESTION:

Are you saying that they could not —

are you saying they Just had to investigate or that they
could not refuse to suspend?
MR. CALDWELL;

They should not have permitted

the rates to take effect.
QUESTION:

So you are saying --

MR. CALDWELL;

They should have either rejected

or suspended, but at a minimum they should have ordered a
section 8 investigation —
QUESTION:

Are you saying -—-

were valid.

the question of whether the court could intervene —
QUESTION:

Well, what if you were wrong on your

50

argument with respect to the refusal to suspend?

What if

the Commission could refuse to suspend despite your allega­
tion of a section 4 violations what would you say, the Com­
mission nevertheless erred In refusing to Investigate?
MR. CALDWELL:

Yes, we would say that, Your Honor.

They should have suspended or rejected because of the ob­
vious prosecription in section 4(1) and the court should be
allowed to intervene to correct that unlawfulness, but short
of that the Commission should have investigated if it had
any doubt in its mind that these violations existed in the
face of the tariffs.
QUESTION:

Isn’t judicial review of refusal to

suspend covered by Arrow and SCRAP?
MR. CALDWELL:

Refusal to suspend in the sense

that the agency is acting within its discretionary judgment,
Your Honor, or applying transportat ion judgmental factors
to the record.

It was not obliged to do that here.

This

was an abuse of statutory authority that comes within the
exception to the Arrow rule as recently announced by this
Court in the Taps case in the opinion written by Mr.
Justice Brennan.

So what we are asking here is that the

Court examine this case in light of the exception to Arrow
and SCRAP recently announced in the Taps ca;e as well as
left for remaining determination in Footnote 22 in SCRAP I,
in which the Court held at that time that It would leave

51
for future determination whether or not exercise or failure
to exercise the suspension power was an abuse of statutory
authority.
Now, with respect to the patent ~
QUESTION:

That was in Leedom v. Kyne, wasn't it?

MR. CALDWELL:

Yes, sir, and other such cases

allowing judicial intervention when there is a clear abuse
of statutory authority.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. CALDWELL:

Now, with respect to the question

of whether or not the tariffs contained departures, I call
your attention to the reply by the railroads at page 272
of the Joint appendix as opposed to their later reply at
page 292 of the appendix.

In the first reply, they provided

a tariff citation and a specific demonstration that there
was not a departure.

And the second reply, with all due

respect, on page 292, there was various mumbo-jumbo and
legal language to the effect that there might be departures
but if there if ere they should b© excused.
With respect to the Commission's ability to
verify the departures, the Commission's rules provide that
an application should be filed in advance or with the
filing of a tariff that contains departures and provides
that under normal circumstances that application should be
filed 30 days in advance of the filing of the rate and only

52
after investigation under the statute and finding a special
case can such rates such as these be allowed to take effect.
The railroads could have filed an application
under section if.

They had months ahead of the time they

files these rates, and that application could have been
subject to disposit

by the Commission pursuant to the

i

clearly required standards of section 4.
How, with respect to the availability of the
section 13 .relief provision, in SCRAP II it was held that
whatever else remained for consideration in a section 13
proceeding, the adequacy of the Commission's determination
of an environmental consideration did not remain.

It Is

our position in this case that whatever else remained for
determination in a section 13 case, the Commission's earlier
failure to resolve the issue of Illegality on the face of
the tariffs and its failure to proscribe the tariffs from
becoming effective could not be determined in the subsequent
13 case on the same rational® that was employed In SCRAP II.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time is expired

now, Mr. Caldwell.
MR. CALDWELL:

1 appreciate that, sir, and Mr.

Spencer will take the remaining time.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD E. SPENCER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS, BOARD OF
TRADE OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO, ET AL.
MR. SPENCER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
From the standpoint of my clients, the crucial
issue in this case simply comes down to whether or not the
Court is going to decide our case on the basis of the facts
and the merits of our case or whether it is going to extend
the Arrow principle to cover every situation where the
Commission allows a rate to become effective regardless of
circumstances and regardless of how arbitrary the Commis­
sion's action is.
I think it is quite obvious that this case Is not
like Arrow and that the Arrow rationale does not apply to
this case.
per se.

The tariffs here are unlawfully discriminatory

There is no primary jurisdiction question involved,

no question of reasonableness,

There is no question of an

injunction pending or an investigat ion.
an investigation.

We did not ask for

That was the theory of the Department of

Justice.
There are no disputed issues of fact.

The tariff

in the case was about four or five pages long and in answer
to a question raised earlier by Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I
think It is obvious that the issue could have been decided

54
on the basis of the tariff, the protest and the reply.

A

straight question of the law is involved, end on the
straight question of lav? no ruling by the Commission is
necessary, and if they had made a ruling; it would not be
binding on the courts.
In other words, this is a question of law which
is ripe for review at this time.

We say that it is wrong

to extend the Arrow principle to cover this type of situa­
tion, for reasons which I state.

It is wrong for the

shippers who are involved in this ease and it would be wrong
for shippers in other eases who are in the situatioai repre­
sented by the amicus in this ease whose case in the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia is being delayed
pending a decision in this casa.
The petitioners here argu® that a decision for
the shippers would create an undue burden on the courts.
I submit that this is a diversionary argument.
is not a typical 15(B) case.

This case

It is a very limited type of

situation and it would occur very infrequently.

It would

not occur any more often than the Alaska Pipeline type of
situation would occur.
But

more importantly, I submit that it is not

the function of the courts to disregard the merits of in­
dividual cases in order to make life easier for the Com­
mission, the railroads or even for the courts.

The law

55
clearly Imposes on the Commission certain obligations and
clearly grants to shippers the right of access to the
courts to correct arbitrary actionss abuse of discretion
and other unlawful actions,
QUESTION:

But Isn’t the question when that access

is granted?
MR. SPENCER:

Xas, and I believe it is very

clear that in this type of situation that access should b®
granted when the Commission refuses to suspend and investigate.
And I should like to make it clear that I draw no distinction
between suspension and investigat ion.

The Commission in this

case should have taken whatever action is necessary to pre­
vent these tariffs from becoming affective.

Now, normally

that would be rejection of the tariffs, but suspension ac­
complishes the same thing.
actions is r©viewable.

So I say that either of those

And I believe for the very reasons

that you b.ava heard here today, that the shippers need the
protection of the courts more now than at a:iy time in the
Commission's history, when the Commission is now engaged in
the program of de facto deregulation without regard to the
statutory standards.
The 4-R Act, which you have heal’d a good deal
CK

about today, did not repeal section 2 of tho Interstate
Commerce Act.

Section 2 prohibits personal discrimination

in freight rates, and I submit that if the railroads were

56
to attempt to raise rates for an individual and not for a
corporation or for women and not for men, no one could
suggest that could not be judicially reviewed at the time
those rates became effective.

This case is no different

because the whole history of the Commission says that when
the shipper furnishes the car, he should be compensated by
the payment of an allowance, which was what was done In
this case,
The petitioners here have studiously avoided any
discussion of the merits of the case.

And 1 suggest that

if they could refuse the merits, they would have attempted
to do so.

Their principal argument is that we can make the

same argument in a complaint case to the Commission, and
that is true, we can.

But I think that that :l3 meaningless

and irrelevant in this situation, because why should we be
required to do that?
don't know already?
fact.

What do w® need to know that w©
There aren't any disputed issues of

We know that the railroads made a 20 percent increase

in railroad cars but not in privata cars,

We know that th®

rates before the increase wars the same, and w© know that
the shippers who furnish private ears are compensated by
a published allowance as required by section 15, paragraph
15 of the Act as it formerly exist©!.
Furthermore —
QUESTION;

Mr. Spencer, if it is that clear, why

57
would you not promptly start a section 13 complaint pro­
ceeding?
MR. SPENCER:

Because we want to settle this

principle and I think in this case what we had here was a
seasonal rate.

We had a rate that was in effect for three

months and I believe that we were entitled to raise the
issue in this case as to the right of the railroads to put
thin In discriminating between the two different types of
cars.

Now, by the time the court reached a decision on

the merits, the suspension problem had become moot because
the rates were already In and were out. ' So 1 think the
issue could be settled but it is an extremely Important
question of principle.
Now, they also say in their reply brief, they
cite some cases which they say refutes our argument.
is not correct.

This

They say that in the rent or trade case,

the Commission found lawful rates of a million dollars a
year in railroad furnished cars and $700,000 a year in
shipper furnished cars.

That is an incorrect statement.

The Commission found the rates in the railroad
>

•equipment to be unlawful.

As a matter of fact, they found

the whole rent or trade scheme to be unlawful insofar as
the railroad cars are concerned.
The other eases they cite, the other two cases
arose during the period of federal control during World

58
War I, and in none of the cases was an allowance involved.
We don’t deny that the railroads can publish rates in pri­
vate cars and that those rates wou3d b® different or could
be different from the rates in railroad cars so long as
they don’t pay an allowance.
effect today.

There are rates to that

But what we say is that they can’t do both,

that they can pay an allowance and then make a discrimina­
tory rate on top of it, and there is no case in the history
of the Commission that says that they can up to this time.
So all we really want to do is to have the oppor­
tunity to show the reviewing court that the tariffs were in
fact discriminatory as a matter of law,.
show that we are out of court.
.

i

.

And if we can’t

But if it we can show it,

then I think we are entitled to the relief that we ask for.
I would Just like in closing to make one remark
that I believe that the question of reviewability and the
question of remedy selected by th© court below are really
two different questions.

The court below correctly held

that the Commission’s action was f©viewable.

Now, as I

say, when the case was first presented to the Court below,
they denied a TRO, but they denied it on the merits, they
didn’t deny it because of failure to have Jurisdiction to
hear that kind of an argument or to hear that kind of a
ease.

Th€>y denied it on the balance of the equities.
I think that on the question of reviewability,

59
that it Is very clear that that is reviewafcle.

Now, I have

suggested that since a straight question of law is involved
that this Court can decide that question and simply tell the
Eighth Circuit to order refunds in the case.

I think also

it would be quite appropriate for this Court simply to tell
the Eighth Circuit to go ahead and decide the question of
law, but I don't think an investigation is necessary.

As

2 say, we didn't ask for it and —
QUESTION:

You contend they should decide the

question of law just on the pleadings, with no evidence?
MR. SPENCER;
QUESTION;

Yes.

Just on the basis of the tariff itself?

MR. SPENCER:

On the basis of the facts that we

have put up and, of course, on the lav; that we submitted to
the Eighth Circuit.

We submitted a brief on the legal

issues.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have about seven

minutes remaining.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 78-597
— REBUTTAL
MR. EVANS:

Thank you.

Both Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Spencer have argued
that the Commission was required to suspend these rates, to

60
stop them from taking effect.

They argued that before the

Court of Appeals and they did not prevail.

The Court of

Appeals ordered only that the Commission must investigate.
It did not hold, did not order the Commission to take steps
that the respondents her® asked for.
The only issue before the Court is the question
of the reviewability of the suspension order.

They failed

to cross-petition and in our view the arguments that they
make are simply Impermissible at this stage.
Beyond that, it is simply not the ease that the
issues that were raised by the shippers in this ease could
be intuited on the face of the papers before the Commission.
What was filed were supplements to very largo tariffs.
am

I

told they are not quite as large as thebig one, but

almost as large as the big one, thousands of individual
rates dealing with thousands of points In the southern
territory.

The supplements themselves were relatively

small but they converted all the rabes in the broader
tariffs to 20 percent larger numbers.
The allegations of fourth section violations,
that is the long-and-short haul violations, were presented
by the shippers in their protest, filed three weeks after
the tariffs themselves were filed.

An allegation was made

that the tariffs, these thousands of rates reflected
hundreds of violations.

They cited one example.

That one

61
example respondents have now admitted on brief was in
error.

Tt*o days before the effective date they submitted

a supplementary petition attaching five more examples,
again saying that these are just exemplary of pervasive
violations.
Wells, 'the Commission has limited resources it­
self.

The shippers who were most affected were able to

dig up a total of six, one of which was icrong, in a period
up to the second day before the effective date.
QUESTION:

The —

Suppose the allegations had been —

they said there are hundreds and they are as followss and
they listed 500 of them and they were clear as a bell,
what should the Commission do then?

MR. EVANS:

When the Commission has suspended a

rate that it has no authority to suspend or at least the
allegation is it has no authority to suspend, then —
QUESTION:

You say it is different if it is

alleged that you have no authority to refuse to suspend?
MR. EVANS:

Well, I would say It is different if

the allegation goes to the Commission's exercise of the
suspension discretion, an acknowledged discretion that it
has exercised.
QUESTION:

I know, but these allegations say

they have absolutely no authority to refuse to suspend in
these circumstances, that is the allegation.
MI?. EVANS:

I think that arguably is a revlewable

issue, so long as the remedy sought is not a direction to
suspend or direction to investigation but a direction to
exercise discretion.
QUESTION:

Now, you say you have been absolutely

63
consistent.

Are you remaining so?

MR. EVANS:

I believe so.

The point I am making

is that —
QUESTION:

I thought you said it doesn't make

any difference how illegal it was alleged, the rates, if it
were claimed to be under section 4, the Commission could
refuse to suspend them.
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Yes, the Commission •—
Without there being any reviewability

of it.
MR. EVANS:

Yes.

The Commission in my Judgment

does not have an obligation to suspend even in the face of
tariffs that it finds are apparently unlawful,

It ordinarily

will take action of that sort, but it is not required to do
so.

And the argument, the analogous argument ~
QUESTION:

But do you think-if they refuse to

suspend, that it is reviewable or not?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

I think if the argument is that —
Then.

Then.

— if the Commission has declined to

consider whether to suspend, it has refused to exercise a
discretion it lawfully has, I think the court may review
the refusal to exercise that discretion and order the Com­
mission to exercise its discretion.
of the TAPS case

That Is the analogy

QUESTION:

But it is allaged here that the Com­

mission has absolutely no discretion to refuse to suspend
in this ease when it is so clearly claimed that there is a
violation of section

on the face of the tariffs.

That

is the allegation.
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That is the allegation —
You don't think that is the review-

ability concession in TAPS?
MR. EVANS:

I expect that it could be argued

that it is not, but the point Is that it is not even before
the Court.

The argument was made in the Eighth Circuit

and it was not accepted by the Eighth Circuit„

The Eighth

'Circuit held only that the Commission was required to in­
vestigate and ordered an investigation.
QUESTION:

’

Well* I irould think you would make the

same argument between investigation and suspension.
MR. EVANS:

Well, the argument that the respondents

have been making is that these tariffs were facially unlawful
the Commission had no alternative but to stop them from
taking effect.
QUESTION:

"
I take your argument to be — to have
\

have an emphasis on the limited order of the Eighth Circuit
related only to investigation.
MR. EVANS:

That’s correct.

What the Commission

was faced with here wore tariffs that were — it was not

65
even clear to the Commission on the face of it that these
were not plainly paper rates , it is not clear that these
shippers — in fact, they have never really alleged that
they are going to be hurt by these rates.

It is an ideal

occasion for remitting shippers to their section 13
remedies which are available for someone who is actually
injured.
I want to correct one other point and that is
that the section 13 remedy is available and the Commission’3
precedents so hold to raise and adjudicate dsectlon 4 issues,
and if a violation of section 4 is found in a section 13
complaint proceeding, damages are available.

The measure

of damages may draw on concepts of reasonableness and dis­
crimination, but damages are available oven if the only
violation that is alleged is a section 4 violation.

Our

reply brief points that out.
QUESTION:

Mr*. Evans, do you understand the Court

of Appeals to have ordered a complete investigation on the
entire tariff or just in the five instances that they say
were plainly unlawful?
MR. EVANS:

It is ambiguous, quite frankly.

I

have read it a number of different ways a number of differ­
ent times.

I think it can be read either way.

The Court’s

emphasis throughout Its opinion is on the alleged violations
of section 4, but it also speculates; toward the end of its

66
opinion that there may also be a problem with sections 2
and 3 involving private ears and railroad cars, which Mr.

Spencer alluded to.

And do you take the position that

QUESTION:

these five examples are or are not unlawful?
MR. EVANS:

The Commission has not determined it.

I don't have a position on it.

It has simply not been re­

solved.
QUESTION:

So your submission then has to be that

even If they are patently violative of section 4, the Com­
mission refuses to suspend them?
i

MR. EVANS:

Yes, the Commission can make a Judg­

ment whether it agrees that they are patently unlawful but
even if so, whether it needs to take the action that the
respondents have asked for.
QUESTION:

There is not a murmur a3 to whether

they think they are patently unlawful or net.
MR,, EVANS:
QUESTION:

What, in the --

Do you think they are patently unlawful

based on
MR. EVAN'S:

The Commission did net ignore these

violations, these alleged violations.
QUESTION:

Stevens that the Commission hasn't passed cn it.

to the fact that there were alleged section 4 violations.

I thought that was your argument.
