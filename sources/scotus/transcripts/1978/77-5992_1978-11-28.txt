PROCEEDINGS

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments first

this morning in 77-5992* Addington against Texas.
Miss Boston* you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTHA L. BOSTON* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MISS BOSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
The Appellant in this case Is confined in Austin
State Hospital* as a result of an order of Indefinite commit­
ment.

The Appellant came from a disturbed family.

In December

of 1975i» following a family argument* he was taken- to Jail and
minor criminal charges ware filed against him.

Those charges

were subsequently dismissed and in their place the state in­
stituted indefinite commitment proceedings.

The commitment

trial lasted for five days* during which time the jury heard
conflicting testimony as to the need to commit the Appellant.
The Appellant urged that the standard of proof in his
case should be beyond a reasonable doubt* but the jury was in­
structed to make its findings on clear* unequivocal and con­
vincing evidence.
QUESTION:

The Appellant is an adult* is he not?

MISS BOSTON:
QUESTION:

He is.

He is approximately 31°

He has been in mental institutions on how

many occasions before this?

4
MISS BOSTON:
many occasions.

The record isn't clear on exactly how

There have been several.

QUESTION:

Somewhere in the record It suggests that h@

has been in ten times in the last five years.
MISS BOSTON:

I believe-it was something like eight

or nine within the last five years.
The Appellant had urged that beyond a reasonable
doubt be required, but that was overruled and the court inst rue ted clear and convincing evidence* or clear* unequivocal
and convincing evidence.
The Jury found that he was to be comitted for an In­
definite period of time* and the Appellant filed .tils appeal in
the intermediate state appellate court* on the basis that proof
beyond a reasonable doubt is required by the Due Process Clause.
That court agreed with Appellant and reversed the order of com­
mitment, but on appeal to the State Supreme Cour% that court
found that a mere preponderance of the evidence was all that
was necessary to indefinitely confine a person in a mental
hospital.

That court, therefore, reverse:! the Court of Civil

Appeals and affirmed the order of commitment from the trial
court.
As a result of this order of commitment, the Appellant
has been confined behind the locked doors of Austin State
Hospital for almost three years.

He can't leave the facility.

His movements, his activities, his visotors within the hospital

5
are all restricted# subject to supervision by the staff.

He has

been subjected to chemical therapy and to twenty-two electroshock treatments.

He faces the very real possibility that he

may never leave the walls of Austin State Hospital.
QUESTION:

Let me go back to the standard.

What was

required to be proved to bring about- a commitment in the jury
trial that you say lasted five days?
MISS BOSTON:
two issues.

The substance of standard in Texas is

The first is that the person is mentally ill and#

second# that the person requires hospitalization for his own
welfare and protection or for the protection of others.

It is

possible# under the statute -- It Is actually required under the
statute to reach a third issue regarding mental incompetence-#
but the state failed to plead that, so it was not submitted to
the jury.
QUESTION:

And there was psychiatric testimony on

both sides?
MISS BOSTON:
state side.

There was psychiatric testimony on the

On the Appellant's side, there was social worker

and psychological testimony, and our psychologist was stipulated
to be an expert.
QUESTION:

And the psychiatric testimony was to the

effect that he was a schizophrenic; is that correct?
MISS BOSTON:

A schizophrenic, yes.

There were —

Some said he was chronic schizophrenic,and it was said he was

6
schizophrenic paranoid type# paranoid “Schizophrenic# variations
of schizophrenia# yes# Your Honor„
The Appellant has been confined for three years# but
in addition to the confinement the Appellant also has been
stigmatized«

The state# by labeling him a mentally ill person

has labeled him a social deviant.

And if he ever leaves the

hospital# he will be a former mental patient.

Studies are

replete with evidence that this is a form of social deviancy
that is most feared and rejected in our society.
QUESTION:

Does Texas provide any periodic review?

MISS BOSTON:

Texas has a requirement that each

patient be examined at least every six months.

There is a

provision whereby he, the patient# may petition for reexamina­
tion.

He is limited to doing that,the first time, a year from

his commitment, and then after that he can only do it every two
yea rs.
QUESTION:

Has Appellant sought that review?

MISS BOSTON:
QUESTION:

He has not.

But there have been six-month reviews#

have there?
MISS BOSTON:

There had been, but this appeal ha®

been pending all of that time.
The interests that are at stake for Appellant in
this case, and indeed for anyone facing an indefinite commitment,
are very much the same interests that were at stake in VI ins hip.

7
Those are the interests of the juvenile delinquent or a criminal
defendant.

The interests are that of the total loss of his un­

conditional liberty and freedom from being stigmatized.

The

interests were found by this Court in that case to be of such
transcending value that proof beyond a reasonable doubt would
be required of the state before those interests would be sacri­
ficed.

That decision was mads, regardless of the fact that the

state's motives in juvenile delinquency proceedings were benevol­
ent and very worthwhile motives.

The motives, in fact# are

very similar here, those of protecting and those of giving
treatment.
The Court's reasoning was very clear in Winshlp, that
the reason for requiring the higher standard of proof is that
the interests for the individual at stake are so great that the
risk of erroneous confinement cannot be any higher than that.
The Texas Supreme Court in its decision totally ignored
the teaching of Winship.

In fact, it relied on the very reason-

ing that was rejected in Wins hip., that is, that the benevolent
state motivations would justify a lower standard of proof.
As I said, the state's motivations are almost Iden­
tical and there seems to be no real justification for using a
lower standard of proof based on that and based on M ins hip.
QUESTION:

Miss Boston, am I right' in thinking that

you do not here press the contention that although the reason­
able -- beyond a reasonable doubt requirement might not b©

8
required by the Fourteenth Amendment, there is a requirement
that proof be at least by a clear and convincing evidence?
MISS BOSTON:

Well, Your Honor, it is my position that

proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required,

I recognize that

there is a very real possibility that this Court would consider
clear and convincing as an intermediate ground, and, indeed,
that was the instruction below,
QUESTION:

What makes you think that?

MISS BOSTON:

Well, there is a number of states that

use clear and convincing and that has been argued in the briefs
on the other side.

The ara.ic.ae briefs have suggested clear and

convincing might be an alternative.
QUESTION:

Don't you think, though, that the rule of

proof beyond the reasonable doubt, which was applied in Winship,
had great historical roots in the Common Law as proof for a
criminal case? Whereas, clear and convincing evidence simply
comes over from the fraud type of case In a civil action.

It

is of fairly recent origin and so far as I know hasn’t been
implanted in the Constitution historically.
MISS' BOSTON:

I think you are right, although, of

course, this Court has recognized clear and convincing a# the
standard in some cases, deportation, for instance.
The beyond a reasonable doubt standard, as it comes
down through the Common Law and as it was stated in Wlnshlp,
the purposes of that standard are to reduce the risk of an

9
erroneous confinement,,

And that's exactly what's at stake her®,

regardless of the fact that this Is labeled --as in Gault w@

QUESTION:

each side.

But there are three of equivalent standing on

Three who say yes and three who say no.

How in the

world will a layman find beyond a reasonable doubt?
MISS BOSTON:

Well, 1 believe, Your Honor, that --

Well, first of all, the jury's function, of course, 1® to v/®lgh
the believabillty of each of those three -- or six -- equival­
ent psychiatrists.

That's right.

That’s right, but very much the same

But additionally, I don't believe that the

state has to rely solely on psychiatric testimony in a vacuum.
I think psychiatric testimony or psychiatric assessment® are
based upon observations, history

They are based upon facts.

It is an opinion drawn from facts.
QUESTION:

Could a layman do that without help?

MISS BOSTON:

I would suggest that the state bring in

10

witnesses, perhaps eyewitnesses, fco acts of dangerous conduct or
continuing history of self-neglect.

It seems to me that it

would be quite easy to buttress the psychiatrist’s opinion by

QUESTION:

The average person, without more, could

find out that this is a schizophrenic person?
MISS BOSTON:
QUESTION:

Well, that is —

You would at lesst have to tell him what

a schizophrenic person was.
MISS BOSTON:

That’s true.

But being a schizophrenic

person alone is not sufficient, under the standard, to lock a
person in a mental hospital.
QUESTION:

Would you tell us again what the standard

is in Texas.
MISS BOSTON:

It is "requires hospitalization for

his own welfare and protection or the protection of other®.'
QUESTION:

So, that’s a predictive opinion, rather

than any factual determination; isn't it?
MISS BOSTON:

It is really hard to distinguish what

is predictive; what’s historical, what's factual.

It is all

But It seems to me that the assess­

ment comes from a factual basis.
QUESTION:

Did this jury hear from some witnesses that

there had been ten episodes which previously led to hi®

11
confinement in a mental institution over a period of five years?
MISS BOSTON:
QUESTION:

Yes* it did.

So* that would be a basis on which they

could draw some inferences about the future.

This Court recognized in Minnesota ex rei. Pearson,
which was a sex offender statute* I believe* which is not
exactly in point* but the language of the Court recognized the
ability of the jury* or fact finder* to look at acts of past
conduct as pointing to probabilities of future conduct.
QUESTION:

The reason I asked my question* Miss

Boston* is that it occurs to me that what standard of proof may
be required is inevitably connected with what the standards are
for involuntary commitment in any particular state.
are historic factual standards* it may be one thing.

If they
If they

are opinion standards by experts* it might be something else.
If it is a very strict standard* substantively* before a person
can be involuntarily committed* it may be one thing.

If it is

very loose* low-threshold* it may be something else* as a matter
of the substantive criteria for involuntary commitment.

And

each state* of course* I suppose* is different.
MISS BOSTON:

I would think that that would be the

area where we would allow the states their flexibility In
drafting* within* of course* guidelines of broadness and

12

vagueness* allow the states the flexibility of creating* writing
out their substantive criteria.
QUESTION:

But isn't that where* perhaps* the real

constitutional vice might lie?

Certainly* there are meets and

bounds* constitutional meets and bounds* I would suppose* which
a state could not exceed,

It couldn't say that anybody with

hair of a certain color should be involuntarily committed®
MISS BOSTON:

Certainly* that's true* but the vice*

it seems to me* is in the basic question of how much proof*
regardless of what we are proving* how much proof are we going
to have?

And that's what was addressed in Wins hip.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't that depend on what it is neces-

sary to show* before somebody can be involuntarily committed?
Aren't the two just inevitably connected?

Can one say for the

nation of fifty states* fifty individual states* each with
different standards for involuntary commitment* that the
Constitution requires a certain level of proof?
the level of proof

Because doesn't

Isn't it* as I say* Inexorably connected

with what the substantive criteria are for involuntary commit­
ment?
MISS BOSTON:

Your Honor* it is connected* but in

the same sense* in the criminal content we don't vary the
quantum of proof based on the elements of the offense.
QUESTION:

But generally those are historic facts

we are talking about in a criminal prosecution* plus mens rea

and other things.
MISS BOSTON:

Certainly, but again the predictive

nature of these hearings -- of this evidence — as has been
cast is not solely predictive.

There is very much factual

As I said, the psychiatrists' assessments ar®

based on factual evidence,
QUESTION:

But they are giving their expert opinions.

MISS BOSTON:

That’s true, but the fact finder does

not have to rely on that in a vacuum, if the state or the
respondent brings forward other factual evidence.

I would think

that that would be the most responsible way to conduct a commit­
ment hearing for the state, to rely not just on psychiatric
testimony, but to bring in as much evidence -QUESTION:

What if a state said that anybody can be

qualified psychiatrists, he should be, and those were the sub­
stantive standards for involuntary commitment.

Where is your

If two qualified psychiatrists simply

testify, "In our opinion, he should be involuntarily committed .
MISS BOSTON:
QUESTION:

I think those are two separatee questions.

Well, what if a state did do that, as a

matter of its substantive law of involuntary commitment?
MISS BOSTON:

Are you asking me, if beyond a reasonable

doubt could be met?
QUESTION:

Then there would be no question of burden

14

of proof.

The question would be:

Are those substantive stan­

dards constitutionally permissible?
MISS BOSTON:

That's right# but the substantive

standards aren't in question here.
QUESTION:

The only issue —

But I suggest though that what is in

question is the burden of proof.

What dogs the Constitution

require by way of a burden of proof?

And my suggestion and my

question is that there may be no one answer applicable to fifty
different states# because each state has jiffering criteria for

involuntary commi'tment.
MISS BOSTON:
QUESTION:

I understand.

Are there not some states where the

statute provides precisely what Mr. Justice Stewart has just
outlined# that a commitment involuntarily may be made on ths
testjmiony of two physicians?

I think any element that

is going to result in total confinement, total deprivation of
liberty, has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Thank you.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Hury.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. HURY, JR», ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR, HURY:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
It is the position of the State; of Texas, that I

18

humbly represent here

concerning a due process question --

We feel that the question involving the statute are the pro­
visions as recognized by the State of Texas, concerning reason­
able doubt or preponderance, does not exist in a vacuum.

The

due process that is followed by the State of Texas does not
hinge on the question of whether it should be preponderance of
the evidence or beyond reasonable doubt.

It hinges, we feel, on

the other necessities of due process which are granted in this
particular case, and indeed every case of someone who is to be
committed in the State of Texas.
The whole procedure does not begin merely from the
question of indefinite commitment„

The procedure begins, basic­

ally, with the question of whether or not a temporary commit­
ment should be allowed and that, indeed, it is necessary for
a temporary commitment before an indefinite commitment.
person or a physician must notify a court.

A

That physician or

person must be recognized by that court and that court then
sets aside two physicians who are responsible for evaluating
the condition of the person who is to be evaluated.

They then

give notice, have a hearing before a judge and may be committed
for same 90 days In a Texas mental health hospital.
The judge is able to stop this proceeding at any
point, up until the time the person Is entered into the pro­
cedure and, indeed, upon entering the particular mental in­
stitution, he could be discharged immediately.

In the event

19

that a person is discharged and comes before a judge again
concerning his mental capacity* there is no guarantee that the
temporary commitment will not be tried againland* indeed* it
hasi in this particular case* there were some eight temporary
commitments.
QUESTION:

Can you tell us a little bit* at some

point* about the review procedures* the periodic reviews?

Do

that at your own convenience.
MR0 HURY:

My understanding* Mr. Chief Justice* is

that there is a minimum requirement of two mandatory reviews
-«* or one mandatory review every six months or two par year.
I do believe* in just my own knowledge* that there is considerably more than that.

I do not believe that the State of

Texas allows someone to languish in a building somewhere and
only see them, once every six months.

I am prepared to repr'sent

that I believe we provide them with competent psychiatric evalu­
ation as much as possible or as much as the facilities allow*
that they are under psychiatric evaluation and* indeed* that
the drugs and the treatment which are recognised by the medical
society as trying to help these people.
The indefinite commitment which — there ware two in
this case
judge.

follows a sworn petition which is presented by the

Again* two psychiatrists — in this case two psychia­

trists and I believe it is required that at least one be a
psychiatrist

must evaluate this person within 15 days of a

20

hearing of this particular type*

An attorney can and is almost

— and I believe is always provided.

That 7 days before the

particular hearing notice must be given again a jury is
available and* indeed* at the end of that particular procedure
if after a jury verdict a judge doe® not agree with that verdict*
he may order the return of the lawsuit to another jury and order
a new trial.
This particular procedure* it is the hope of the
State of Texas* forms the basis for an entire evaluation of
soma possibility of whether or not this person doe® represent a
danger to himself or others and* indeed* try in some way to
make this person available once again to society.
There can be no doubt that the question involved
here does involve soma loss of liberty.

The idea is whether or

not this loss of liberty is analogous to a penal institution
and that loss of liberty being a total and complete deprivation
of liberty for a specified period of time.

It is only pointed

out that we do feel that the procedures whereby the commitment
or the committed person is evaluated and* indeed* the very pos­
sibility that upon the day of his admission that he could be
released points to the Idea* among other things, that this is
not analogous to a prison* it is not analogous to a set period
of time in which a person must languish In prison before hi®
release* even considering parole.
The provisions of ftie Mental Health Codes and the

21
mental health provisions of these hospitals do not render this
a prisono

It renders it a place where we hope* with some small

success* to b© able to help people»
I think there is another basic problem here a@ to
whether or not the person who is considered for both procedures*
criminal procedure and the civil commitment procedure* whether or
not that person is of a mind to be able to adequately decide what
is best for that person»

The thought or idea of a culpable &e°

fendant in a criminal matter conspicuously concerns someone who
is available to input by counsel* by other persons who are trying
to represent that person before a court of laxv»

His ability to

evaluate his position and his possibilities while confronted
with the State are available to a person who the system assumes
is culpable if there is no question of psychiatric problem
raised»
The problem* I think* is particularly available as
to what in the world are we going to do with someone who does
not completely understand what’s going on about him.
one whose ability

As to some-

to evaluate his ability to proceed in life*

his ability to understand what the people around him need* in
addition to his own needs.
I think the particular problem here is that if a
person does not wish to seek help that the first problem in
effective treatment is getting that person in the position
where he acknowledges he does have a problem and that he is

22

suffering from some abnormal condition.
If this particular provision can be met than it is
the hope that after a person realises that he has a problem
that than the procedures under which this State of T@sa§ pro­
ceeds is of a hopeful nature that it would return this p€;r®om
to some sort of useful place in society,
QUESTION:

Is to change it to beyond reasonable doubt

intolerant for the State of Texas?
MR» HURY:

As a question of whether it is intolerant

or not, the problem, I think, pointed out by the State of Texas,
and once again, just pointing to Turner, it is one of the in­
exact nature of psychiatric testimony, the inability of certain
forms of the medical profession to predict what is going to
happen in the future, and as to whether or not that particular
ability to predict is available to the question of beyond a
reasonable doubt.
I think that what it certainly will do, sir, is to
reduce the number of people who are committed to treatment
because of the ability of counsel to cross-examine a psychiatrist
and to have him admit that not all psychiatrists agree on what
is to happen in a particular case.
QUESTION:

That's also true in a criminal case, but

you have to do it.
MR* HURY:

Yes, sir, without a 3oubfc.

QUESTION:

And in this, it is your position that you

23

can’t do it?
MR, HURY:

It is our position that in denying certain

abilities to prove certain things, that is, that there are
certain standards that would be much more difficult to m«tefc,
that there are people who would be excluded from that process.
QUESTION:

But it is not impossible, it could be done?

MR* HURY:

It is being done.'

It Is already the

standard in several states.
QUESTION:

That's what I mean.

MR, HURY:

Yes, sir*

QUESTION:

Mr. Hury, one of the amicus briefs, the

one for the National Center for law on the Handicapped, makes
the argument that the unreliability of predictions cuts the
other way, that if you have a low standard of proof it means
that there will be a lot of people committed who really should
not be committed, because psychiatrists tend to over-predict
dangerousness and the like, in order to be conservative.
I am just wondering, isn't there seme force to that
suggestion that the whole fact that it is quite an unreliable
and uncertain area is a reason for not depriving people of their
liberty on doubtful evidence?
MR. HURY:
valid*

The opposite argument is, of course, as

The only thing that 1 would like to point to is that

this question does not exist in a vacuum, that there are other
things which are available to be proved, there are certain

24

concrete things that can be proved concerning a person's past
history.

It is particularly the problem of predicting future

problems that come within the psychiatric province that you are
talking about* Your Honor.
QUESTION:

This problem would be avoided, if you

adopted a system such as Wisconsin hag* relying on past acts*,
rather than opinions a® to what might happen in the future.
I guess part of it really relate® to the substantive standards*
doesn-'-'t it?
MR. HURY:

I believe it does* sir.

QUESTION:

Is this* fundamentally* very mush dif­

ferent from the kind of predictive analysis which a parole board
makes when it considers whether it should release a convicted
prison',

half-way or one»third the way through his commitment?
MR. HURY:

MR* HURY:

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr» Klein,

G

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL X0 KLEIN, ESQ,*
ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOC .'CATION AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR, KLEIN:

Mr, Chief Justice* and may It please the

Court:
I am here today representing the American Psychiatric
Association as amicus curiae,
This Court is well aware it is psychiatrists who play
a critical role in the actual civil commitment proceedings.
Based on the experience of the Association and its members* we
would urge the Court not to constitutionalize the burden of
proof in civil commitment.

We do so*largely* for the reasons

that* I think* were being suggested by Mr, Justice Stevens when

29
he asked about the relationship between criteria and substantive
burden of proof.

That is the second criteria under burden of

proof.
It seems to me* as the Court recognized in Patterson
v. Mew York, only the term before last* that if you lock in a
burden of proof* you In many ways limit the discretion of the
state in terms of its criteria from liberalizing* from changing*
from beginning to cope with new and different ways to deal with
difficult and intractable problems such as mental health and
involuntary commitment.
Now* as Mr. Hury has made claim from the State of
Texas* this is not a Gault type case.

Texas gives civil corn-

mitees a great deal of due process* Including a jury trial.

In

this particular case, this patient had a 5-day jury trial, with,
I think* as many as twelve to fourteen witnesses.
The single question is whether one procedure should
be mandated to cut across-the-board in all fifty states in
civil commitment.
Now* there is the simple analogy to Winship and
juvenile proceedings that Appellant relies on.

I think the

analogy doesn't hold water* and I think so for the following
reasons.

After Gault, the juvenile proceeding was in fact

formalized.

You than had the Issue of the burden of proof.

That wasn’t going to change the proceeding* by and large; that
was simply going to require more evidence to protect against an

30

erroneous conviction of a criminal charge.
However, when you go to MeKelver, the Court would not
constitutionalize the jury trial requirement.

Ad it didn't do

so because it was concerned that a jury trial would affect the
juvenile justice system in a way, perhaps, that the burden of
proof would not.

And that was because it would strip the juven­

ile judge of his role.
Now, if we turn to civil commitment, I think the same
thing applies when we are talking about burden of proof.

That

is, I think it is much more analogous to a jury trial require­
ment.

And the reason I say that is as follows.

It seems to me,

unlike a juvenile delinquency determination, a civil commitment
spans a host of different criteria.

Juvenile delinquency deals

with the commission of a criminal act.

The burden of proof

beyond a reasonable doubt is well suited to prove past acts.
Civil commitment deals with a variety of things in a variety of
states, some of which do focus quite strongly on damgerousnoss
and actually require, as Wisconsin does, proof of past overt
acts.

That, it seems to me, is a legislative decision and

perhaps one that the legislature can responsibly make, based
on its experience.

But I don't think this Court should lock

that process in by mandating a high burden of proof.
QUESTION:

Suppose the substantive standard does

depend, in part, on a past act, a historical fact, which way
would your running argument — a lower or a higher standard of

31

proof should be required?
MRo KLEIN:

You say if it's a past act —

If you extend it to past act, it is

certainly more feasible to prove by a higher standard of proof,
there is no doubt«

My argument would be that the Constitution

shouldn't ^require that because the state can then address its
standard of proof to the given criteria»
QUESTION:

Your argument, in a way, is that the

standard of proof should depend to some extent on the substan­
tive standard?
MRo KLEIN:

I think the standard of proof affects it,

not that it depends upon it.

I think it is a mafuter of con­

stitutional law»
QUESTION:

Which way do you run it?

The looser th©

standard, what should happen to the burden of proof then

or

the standard of proof — go up or down?
MR» KLEIN:

As a matter of constitutional law, I

think it should be unaffected 0
QUESTION:

So that the standard you choose really

doesn't depend on the substantive standard?
MR» KLEIN:

The standard of proof will affect the

substantive standard, I am arguing, because if you choose a
high —
QUESTION:

Yes, but the substantive standard shouldn't

affect the standard of proof»
MRa KLEIN:

I think that's right,

constitutional law.
appropriate.

Now* as a matter of policy* I think it i®

For example* if you look at the states that have

looked and taken a prior act standard* like Wisconsin»

They have

used* as a matter of legislative policy* proof beyond a reason­
able doubt.
QUESTION:

Because some of the arguments in the brief

filed are that the looser the standard the higher -- the looser
the substantive grounds* the higher the standard of proof*
because the more margin for error»
MR0 KLEIN:

Well* there is more margin for error* but

it depends what you mean by error* Mr. Justice»

Here* I think*

it is very different from the criminal process»

1 think we have

to get away from that kind of thinking.

Unless wa are going to

take the position — or this Court is going to rule that the
paren.8J.oatrla power of the state is nonexistent and that all
state efforts in hospitalizing somebody are police power
efforts* it seems to me what the difference of an erroneous
commitment is that in the criminal area there is a lucky guy*
the guy who should be convicted and is acquitted»
away and he got a real windfall»

He walks

If he commits another crime*

the state suffers the burden* ths loss»

In civil commitment*

that's not the case»
QUESTION:

Mr. Klein* he does that* I taka it* whether

the offense with which he is charged Is subject to a six months
penalty or death penalty

33
MR. KLEIN:

That's correct.

that's not the case.
QUESTION:

But in civil commitment

The person who is allowed to go free ■==
So if the lower standard of proof means

the possibility of more error, we ought to just put up with it,
because the consequences of error are not as disagreeable a® in
the criminal?
MR* KLEIN:

They are far different.

QUESTION: And the consequences of error in erroneously
sentencing somebody to a six-month sentence are considerably
different than the consequences of error in sentencing someone
to death, are they not?
MR. KLEIN:

They are, but there is no higher standard

of proof than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but even in the
six-month case, Mr0 Justice Rehnqulst, if he goes free, if the
criminal walks out, he gets the windfall if he did it.

Whereas,

if the patient walks out because society or psychiatry cannot
adduce enough evidence to satisfy an unduly high burden, the
patient is not helped.

We do no favor to let -somebody walk out

of an arena and return to freedom who is very, very ill.
Now, if you look at the facts of this particular case.
This particular gentleman engaged repeatedly in more and more
serious behavior.

Now, I assume we can wait, as a society, until

somebody commits the ultimate act and proceed under the criminal
law, but we can try and intervene —
QUESTION:

If you keep developing this, then you can

34
prove it beyond a reasonable doubt* if you say this man is so
violent.
MR, KLEIN:

This particular gentleman* that"® right.

That's the problem with the process.

We don't want to reserve
v

civil commitment for the violent people.

I agree if you turn

the system toward the violent -QUESTION:

Then it is your submission that in this

case Texas could* without any problem* have proved beyond
reasonable doubt?
MR. KLEIN:

Gould prove the fact that this gentleman

engaged in past threats and acts* that is true.

They could not

prove beyond a reasonable doubt* it seems to me* that his mental
illness was so severe or that the effects of not treating him
would be to have his condition deteriorate and hi® violence to
increase in the future.,
QUESTION:

Well* do we set a standard* ordinarily* in

the law because of the potential of being able to meet a high
standard?

That is* simply because Texas could prove* beyond a

reasonable doubt* as they might well have been able to do here*
is that a constitutional reason for requiring that standard?
MR. KLEIN:

Absolutely not* Your Honor.

It seem® to .

me that is a legislative determination which legislatures have
and can make* but that's not a determination that this Court*
as a matter of constitutional law* should make.
QUESTION:

Mr. Klein* you are arguing* as I understand

35
it, that unless we lower the standard, have a relatively low
standard, there are people who will go free who ought to be
committed,
MRo KLEIN:

Righto

QUESTION:

Isn't the obverse also true, that If you

have a low standard, there will be people who will be committed
who should not be committed?
MR. KLEIN:

I think that's righto

QUESTION:

And what you are saying is it is better to

accept the risk of a significant number of people being er­
roneously committed than the other side,,
MR. KLEIN:
commitment is.

Well, it depends again what an erroneous

This is a little different than the criminal

law.
QUESTION:

Well, one that does not, in fact, satisfy

the standard of danger to himself or others or being mentally
ill.

I suppose you can be wrong about the mental Illness.
MR. KLEIN:

That is correct.

And it does seem to me

there is a potential for that erroneous commitment, and it
increases as you lower the standard.
QUESTION:

Do you disagree with the essence of the

statistical material in the brief I referred to earlier about
the probabilities?

Are you familiar with what I am talking

about?
MR. KLEIN:

Well, I certainly disagree with the Issue

36
on probabilities about mental illness0

I think there are two

issues| that is, there are numerous specific diagnoses and there
is a great deal of disagreement about that»

There is not a

great deal of disagreement about severe mental illness in terms
of psychosis»
QUESTION:

In ycur judgment, or the judgment of your

client, what is the probability that a prediction of dangerousness to one'®' self or to others by a psychiatrist will be
accurate?
MR» KLEIN:
QUESTION:

If by dangerous you mean physical -=
Within the meaning of the Texas standard,

how reliably can you predict that?

are talking about in the next five to 10 years, very low

QUESTION:

Then, it seems to me, you are necessarily

conceding that if you have a low standard of proof there may be
30 or 40$ of the people that are committed that should not be
committed.
MR» KLEIN:

If, in fact, your standard is dangerous­

ness in the sense of acting physical violence»

But those are

people who may be very ill and desperately needed help.
QUESTION:

But, then, if the dangerousness Is not

critical* you ars really saying you are acting for the benefit
of the patient.

You need a low standard of proof because he

doesn't know what's good for him* for himself.

option* that's all I am saying.
the gamut,

I think the states have gone

I think there are statutes that go very much In the

dangerousness direction*, and I think they are entitled to it.
What I am saying is that this issue should be left for the fair
play of political forces.
In MeKeivsr* where the Court did not constitutionalize
a jury trial* it didn't say the jury trial was a bad thing In
juvenile cases.

What it said was* "We are not ready for finality

on that issue."

I think that's the same thing when it comess to

In some states the A PA has argued in the state
legislature for a lower burden of proof and for broad substan=

standard set down in the O'Connor v« Donaldson case* Humphrey

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTHA L. BOSTON* ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MISS BOSTON:

I would like to respond to Mr. Klein's

statement about his parens patriae commitments.

He seems to

presuppose the very thing that we are there to decide* that Is

whether or not this person is mentally 111.

Mr. Klein seems

to assume that he is and that’s why he is not seeking hospital­

for a hearing.

If that's the case* then there is no need

Indeed* that is a purpose of the hearing* and

that's what we are there to decide.
QUESTION:

I understood him to say there are a lot of

mentally ill people who have not committed acts of violence and
that the state has an interest in seeing that they get help.
MISS BOSTON:

I believe he said both* Your Honor* and

41
in relation to that latter statement* I think my statements
earlier about proving a past act don't go just to proving the
past act of violence.

A person who is severely mentally ill* to

the extent that he is self«neglectful* surely there are family
members or neighbors who have seen this sort of conduct and can
testify to it.

It seems to me that that's not that difficult to

establish.
QUESTION:

But you are not saying that a past act is

constitutionally required as a substantive element.
MISS BOSTON:

No* I'm not.

I am saying that that is

a way of buttressing psychiatric testimony* so that you don't
have to rely just on the anamnesis.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't it become pretty much mandatory

if your view Is adopted, in order to get anybody committed?
MISS BOSTON:

I don't believe it would become mandatory.

I think predictions are relied on in several contextsp and I can
point to two specific legislative similar situations in Texas
where proof beyond a reasonable doubt was required for pre­
dicting, if you will* future conduct, not the least of which is
the punishment phase of a capital felony trial in which the jury
is required to ansiver yes or no,beyond a reasonable doubt, the
question of whether there is a probability that the defendant
will engage in criminal violence so as to constitute a continuing
threat to society.
QUESTION:

But a defendant convicted under that system

42

doesn't get a one-year reevaluation, does he?
MISS KLEIN:

No, he doesn't.

But I bring that up not

to say that because it is required in that situation it should
be required here, but to show that ,fehe legislature recognized In
that situation that it is possible.

And that is virtually the

same thing that we are trying to prove here.

And, additionally,

the Mentally Retarded Persons Act in Texas which was passed
since the time that this suit began, requires proof beyond a
reasonable doubt,
QUESTION:

You are emphasizing, and understandably so,

the paraiellism to the criminal system.

But in the administra»

tion of criminal justice, we have in the country thousands,
literally thousands of law enforcements officers who are
roaming, looking for criminal conduct and then arresting people
and probably thousands, but fewer prosecutors who are con­
stantly alerted to or charged with the duty of prosecuting.
We don't have any such mechanism set up to look around for
mentally ill people, do we, in society?
M3B8 KLEIN:

Not that I am aware of, although we have

certainly a —
QUESTION:

Well, the police may bring it to the

attention of hospitals, incidentally, but there is no comparable
structure,

I get, reading some of these briefs, an impression

that there is an attitude of some elements of society to try to
do-in mentally ill people and lock them up and keep them there.

43
And, of course, we know that It costs vastly more to keep
people in mental institutions than it does in prisons.

there any basis for thinking that the Government, in one way or
another, or others not in Government, are trying to commit a
lot of people unnecessarily?
MISS BOSTON:

I don't think it is as insidious as a

I think what it reflects is the severe lack of under­

standing about and knowledge about mental illness in our society.
And this goes to the question of stigma, that people don't under­
stand mental illness and consequently -QUESTION:

Psychiatrists admit that they don't under­

MISS BOSTON:

Certainly,

And Mr. Klein's — the

American Psychiatric Association's brief is full of references,
as is Appellant's, to the kinds of problems that people face,
that mental patients and former mental patients are feared and
loathed in our society, because people don't understand.

It is

How is the change to the maximum burden of

proof — the criminal burden of proof — going to help that
situation?
MISS BOSTON:

Well, what it is going to do 1@ keep

those people who are not proper subjects of commitment from
being committed» therefore stigmatized and deprived of their
liberty

44
Certa inly i» we are not just trying to set up a hurdle
to make psychiatrists in the state jump over for no reason.

We

want to increase the sureness of those assessments that result
in commitment.

Ws want to reduce the number of people who are

erroneously locked in mental hospitals.
QUESTION:

Do you think someone who has gone through

a five-day jury trial., as your client did here* and has been
acquitted after all the testimony and the evidence and is found
not ’mentally ill,, would be welcomed back Into the boson of
society* so to speak?
MISS BOSTON:

Well* of course* the society in which

he was living was very aware of all of that and clearly he has
been stigmatized to begin with,

But the more — Well* there is

one study :in our brief — I believe it is on page 24 — that
says that the level of stigma increases with the level of state
intervenfcion0

So that the more one is committed * the longer one

is committed for the greater the stigma.

And certainly that can

be seen clearly in employment applications 0

If you have to try

to explain away a three-year gap in your snployment history*
you are going to have a big problem.
QUESTION:

Miss Boston* what is It that has to be

MISS BOSTON;

They are entitled to a jury.

QUESTION:

Do you think Texas# or any state# is

constitutionally required to have the same standard for retarda­
tion as they do for commitments for schizophrenia?
MISS BOSTON:

I think there are some very different

considerations that go into them.

This proceeding of commitment

to a mental retardation facility is very similar in what it seeks
to do.

I am not presenting any protection claim at all# but

just saying that’s another area in which it has been recognised
that that sort of thing —
QUESTION:

As you just read it to us# that’s a wholly

predictive element# isn’t it# nothing else?

46
MISS BOSTON:

Well* in the same way that we are

talking about prediction before.

It is prediction based on

retardation and acts* and so on.
QUESTION:

But there has to be a determination of

mental retardation.
MISS BOSTON:

Of mental retardation.

In the same

way that the Mental Health Code requires a determination of
mental illness.
In terms of the necessity of psychiatrists being very
sure about their predictions* their assessments* again* I would
just like to stresas that -- and I believe that Mr. Justice
Stevens brought this up -- there is the inaccuracy of those
assessments that is so concerning in this situation.

believe the statistics that are in the brief for amicus National
Center for Law on the Handicapped* the incidence of error due
to over** predict ion and over-diagnosis -- over-predict ion of

going to occur more in committing someone erroneously than in
failing to commit someone erroneously.

that standard to each witness.

We don't qualify the witnesses

on how sure they are of the testimony they are about to give.
The jury takes the whole picture.

That's why I keep stressing

the other things that can be brought in.
QUESTION:

But the jury can reject any particular

witness* or an individual juror can* on the grounds that he
doesn't believe him or doesn't think he is very reliable or very
sound.

That's the credibility factor* isn't it?
MISS BOSTON:

Certainly.

My point is that the credibility factor goes Into
the jury room.

It doesn't happen when we bring -- We don't

require a psychiatrist to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt*
obviously.

The jury takes it all into the jury room with them.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon* at 11:11 o'clock* a.m„* the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
