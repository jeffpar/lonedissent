MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 77-15^65 Stafford v. Briggs.
Mr. Brownj, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER MEGARGEE BROWN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This Is a case on writ of certiorari to review
the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.

This case and Colby v. Driver, set

in argument in tandem, both involved the question did
Congress Intend in the enactment of the Mandamus and
Venue Act of 1962 to grant United States District Courts
nationwide personal jurisdiction over federal officers and

employees in their private individual capacities, that
is in essence against them for acts allegedly performed
under color of law.

This is a civil rights tort action

brought in the District of Columbia alleging uneonstltu.tional acts and seeking money damages from the poeketbooks
of four individuals who were and are federal employees.
All wrongful acts alleged took place in Florida.
The defendants below are petitioner Stafford,
a United States Attorney in the Northern District of

Florida, now a United States District Judge in the Northern
District of Florida;

petitioner Carrouth, an Assistant

United States Attorney in the Northern District of Florida,
now in private practice in Florida; Meadow, a federal FBI
agent stationed then and now in the Northern District of
Florida; and Goodwin, a Trial Attorney with the United
States Department of Justice in Washington, D. C.

The

plaintiffs are ten individuals called to testify before a
grand jury in Tallahassee, Florida, In 1972.
of the plaintiffs reside in Florida.

A majority

None of the plain­

tiffs reside In the District of Columbia.

Eight of the

plaintiffs were indicted in Florida for conspiracy to
riot.

After trial, each was acquitted.

They became

knwon in the press as the Gainesville. Eight.
Goodwin, who :Ls not a, petitioner here, was1 a
prosecutor appointed as special attorney to act in Florida
'in connection; with this investigation In Florida and the
’trial in Florida out of which this case arose.

Now, the

■complaint beiovr alleges ~ and there has been no trial

,

\

the complaint alleges that Goodwin lied

when examined in the course of the grand jury proceedings
by the presiding'judge in connection with the presence of
government informants emon^ the subpoenaed witnesses in
connection with this investigation.

,

Now, the complaint alleges that the petitioners

5
knew and remained silent with regard to this alleged per­
jury and this constituted a conspiracy against the con­
stitutional rights of the plaintix”fs.

The plaintiffs

here ask damages of $1.5 million out of the pockets of
the petitioners.

They also ask for some declaratory

rights and seek the appointment of a special prosecutor
to bring indictments against petitioners and Goodwin.
The petitioners, have no affiliation with the
District of Columbia, moved to dismiss for insufficiency
of personal jurisdiction, insufficiency of process,
improper venue, and ultimately for a transfer of venue
to Florida.

The District Court judge denied the transfer

of the case to Florida but granted the motion to dismiss.
The Circuit Court, the District of Columbia Circuit Court
reversed and denied the hearing.

It held that the peti­

tioners were subject to the District of Columbia court
solely because of the use by the plaintiffs of the Mandamus
and Venue Act of 1962, more precisely, 1391(e).
The court below determined in effect that —
QUESTION:

You say 1391(e) is more precisely

the Mandamus and Venue Act.

Actually, the Mandamus and

Venue Act in the statutes at large appears as two sections,
doesn’t it, one creating section 1361 and the other
j

/

creating section 139K©)?
MR. BROVIN:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, that

6
is quite right.

The Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962 is

comprised of 1361 which grants the mandamus writ to the
District Court and as an adjunct and to be read with it
and as a part of it is section 2«, which is 1391(e), and
the legislative intent was that section 2 would have as
its purpose the same purpose as the first section.

They

would be read together, and Judge Friendly, in Natural
Resources v. TVA, said they must be read together, the
statute as a whole, and that is absolutely correct.
QUESTION:

When you say the legislative intent

was, it is a little bit hard to get your version of the
legislative Intent out of the language of 1391(e).
MR. BROWN:
mandamus.

Well, 1391(e) is cast in terras of

It provides an officer who is, it provides

who is acting, is acting.

It doesn’t say who was acting.

It deals with on-going present conduct.

It Isn’t a model

of clarity, Your Honor, but it does have language in It
that has the cast of mandamus and was intended so by the
Congress in promulgating it.
QUESTION:

Except in the Act, in one section

they use the word "mandamus,'1 in 1361, and in 1391(e)
they use the word "civil action."
MR. BROWN:

Well, if they are read together,

it isn't necessary to be repetitive.

It is cast in terms

of mandamus and mandamus, in promulgating it they stated

7
that It would be read with the same purpose as mandamus.
And the whole history, both the purpose and the history
indicates that they were meant to be read together, and
if read together they become into perspective.
Our petition was granted on January 15.

At the

same time, the Colby v. Driver petition, a petition that
I also filed, to the Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit was granted, raising for review the same statutory
issues involving venue and jurisdiction.

And to avoid

duplication with the tandem case and with the permission
of the Court, I will make the thrust of my very brief
argument one point common to both cases and that is that
the statute simply does not apply to respondent's suit
against

federal officers and employees pocketbooks.
My partner, Mr. Nemser, in the second case iiriXX

focus on the dual process point.

Now, basically, if Your

Honors please, It Is the language, the purpose and the ■
history of the statute involved here that demonstrate that
Cong2*@sE did not intend its application to suits for money
judgment against federal officers and employees.
When the statute is read in its full contest,
with realization of its purpose, a narrow limited purpose,
and in light of its legislative history., it becomes clear
that Congress did not direct nor intend coverage of
personal tort damage actions as the kind 6? suit brought

8
below.
As a matter, of fact, the suit that is brought
below by respondents didn't exist; in 1962 and it wasn't
established, this Bivens-tyee action, until nine years
later, in 1971.

Now, the respondents in the court below

misinterpret the language, purpose and history of the
statute as an unprecedented break with the past.

In

proper perspective, the statute is not a sweeping general
expansion of venue find jurisdiction.

Their interpreta­

tion which was embraced by the court below would allow
federal employees to become virtual shuttlecocks to be
hit repeatedly in personal damage suits, in scattered
forums throughout the country so long as the acts com­
plained of were alleged to have been performed under
color of legal authority,
QUESTION:

Is there any recognised procedure

pretrial to challenge the substance of the claim for
relief other than summary judgment or motion to dismiss
on the basis that the venue is improper?
MR. BROWN:

Well, those come to mind, what

Your Honor has mentioned, but in cases that I have been
:familiar with where 1191 has been used and it has been
used at least 17 times, as we put in our appendix, once
you are hit with a 1391(e) you are going to be in naln
and suffering and in danger of ultimate difficulties for

9
a long time before you can extricate yourself even on a
motion for summary judgment.
QUESTION:

You would at least have to come Into

the district selected by the plaintiffs to file a motion
for summary Judgment or for improper —
MH. BROWN:

Yes.

ample that I think is valid.

I can give Your Honor an ex­
A non-Detitloner here who

is a defendant below was named Ooodwin.

I also represent

him where he has been hit as a shuttlecock in New York
City.

He Is sued twice there,, not on the same fact

situation but he is sort of a target because he is a
government prosecutor, and in those cases the long arm
statute was declared by the District Court Judge noi; to
be applicable because there wasn’t enough evidence at
the threshold to give jurisdiction under the long arm
statute, but Judge Halt in the Southern District of New
York held that 1391(e) without such evidence was suf­
ficient and he has held there in those cases because of
that.
QUESTION:

And so if he is to argue that the

claim on its merits is frivolous or doesn't state a claim
for relief, he must at least go to the district which
the plaintiffs have chosen and make that argument?
MR. BROWN:

.He will have to go to Nome, he
/
/

/

will have to go to Portland, he will have/'to go to

/

10
Albuquerque, and many people think that a government of­
ficial is only sued once even if it is the same facts,
but in the tandem case, take Colby, for example, he was
hit as a shuttlecock in Washington, D.

C. , he lives in

Maryland, he was hit in Rhode Island in Driver v. Helms,
in a billion dollar case against him.

He was hit in

San Francisco in Klpperman v. McCone, and it was only
because after two years we were able to persuade Judge
Renshaw that 1391(e) didn’t apply to money damage suits
out of the pocketbooks of government officials, it is a
different kind of a suit.

So It can be difficult where

you are hit repeatedly with an easy statute.
Now, the tradition has always been that de­
fendants, whether they are government officials or not,
that they are sued where they live, where they are found
and that is true of all of us.

We are sued that way, by

seizing on a mandamus type action statute in 1^62, the
civil rights bar here is attempting to hit government
officials throughout the country in forums where — and
this is significant — In forums where there is no con­
tact, either no contact where the action did not arise.
The statute is — that is 1391(e), the venue section is
drafted in such a way that wherever a plaintiff goes he
may bring a 1391 action.
Take Colby.

In Colby, the Plaintiffs, one of

11
them lived in Rhode Island, nothing else happened in Rhode
Island.

The mail openings didn't happen in Rhode Island.

The defendant has never been in Rhode Island and there are
25 of them.
QUESTION:

None of the defendants lived in

Rhode Island?
MR. BROUN:
Rhode Island.

None of the defendants were in

QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

I have another problem.
Ye3, Mr. Justice Marshall?
Back in the good old days when you

got onto the government official, they would move.
Wasn't it law for that nurnose, too?
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

Well —
I am not talking about the out of

pocket, I mean when you want to bring mandamus against
him, he was gone.
MR. BROWN:

The judicial review would make It

possible to bring judicial review in a mandamus type
action in every District Court after 1Q62, and we are
not quarreling with that.

QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

You don’t object to that?
We don't object to that at all.

There Is good reason, Mr. Justice Marshall, and let me
state the reason and I think it is factual and it goes
to the root of this case.
Hairer

Budge was a Congressman from Idaho.

His constituents complained that they could not bring an
action for judicial review in connection with land right
grazing rights, wool rights, mineral rights, and because
even though they had --- the plaintiff was there, the
local government official was there, the witnesses were
In Idaho and the documents were — they had to go to
Washington, D. C. because of this novel, and he thought
that was an outrage and he was right, it was an outrage.
So Hamer

Budge came to Washington and he went before

this commiteee and it is on the first cages of the
hearings —the court beloxtf didn’t have the benefits of
the hearings, but Your Honors have the benefits of these
hearings.

In the first pages, he says let me tell you

what my problem Is.

We need judicial review out west,

a thousand miles away, and we can’t get any justice.
Because if you say to us, bring all those witnesses and
N

bring all those documents and bring all those officials
to Washington, then we don't do it and we lose our day
in court.

13
QUESTION:

That may be, and I assume It Is, all

very true so far as the historic genesis of this legisla­
tion goes, but the question is what does the legislation
as enacted, not by Hamer Budget but by the entire Congress,
both houses of Congress, the House and the Senate, what
does it provide?

And 1391(e) seems by Its literal terms

to go considerably further than Hamer Budge’s original
proposal, doesn't it?
MR. BROWN:

Well, I think that that was his

intention and I think that his intention —
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

X assume that that was his intention.
Mr. Justice Stewart, this is not the

first time that 1391(e) has been before this Court.

This

Court in Schlanger v. Seamans in 1971 examined the history
<

of this statute and found that it; was not literal, you
didn't follow every word of the statute, that you look
to the mischief at which it was directed, and there it
was found not to apply to habeas corpus actions.

And Mr.

Justice Douglas said explicitly at that time that 1391(e)
was to broaden venue in those civil actions that urere
restricted prior to 1962 to the District of Columbia.
QUESTION:

Didn't the President have something

to say after the bill was passed and he signed it — of
course, the President can't make legislative history and
he can’t make a statute mean anything that the words do

not mean, but when he signed the bill he made a statement
that this related to actions in the nature of mandamus.
MR. BROW :
QUESTION:

He did.
Now, I suppose there are a lot of

slips between the time the statute was first introduced
and the time when the President signs it, but at least
that suggests what the President thought he was signing.
MR, BROWN:

Mr.

Chief Justice, that is very valid.

In the nature of mandamus was that request' to have the
President do that, was done because of the fear of the
Deputy Attorney General at that time that there might
conceivably ba a misinterpretation of its narrow limits
and I think with hindsight that that was present.

But

the cases have determined that it is limited to these
kinds of cases, mandamus tyoe, and I think it is interest­
ing that in 1976, the only time I knottf that Congress re­
viewed the Mandamus and Venue Act, that there it stated
in the hearings and the reports that it was limited to
mandamus type actions.

It said that, it was limited to

judicial review.
Now, the Second Circuit has also had occasion
to review 1391(e) and Judge Friendly in Natural Resources
v. TVA found that TVA and its officials in an injunctive
action was not within the ambit of the statute.

Judge

Friendly said that this particular statute was not the

15
kind of a text that could be parsed with the aid of a
grammer and dictionary but, rather, what should be looked
to was what was the mischief it tried to cure and what it
was trying to cure here was to allow judicial review
actions, mandamus type actions in the District Courts out­
side the District of Columbia.
Now, this action brought by the respondents could
not have been brought in the District of Columbia and was
not in any way restricted.

Tort damage actions against

public officials were never limited to the District of
Columbia.

That is a ridiculous position and it doesn’t

fit.
What must be done here is to examine the context
of the reports.

They are preferred source.

In the con­

text, it is clear that the problems related to providing
judicial review actions, of eliminating the problem of
indispensable parties, of allowing venue where there were
actions against officials in connection with their duties.
There were no personal jurisdiction problems and there
were no problems of any kind in connection with a tort
action against an official.
I submit to the Court that in 1952 actions of
this kind I said didn’t exist, they weren’t established
until 1971.

But actions against public officials for

wrongdoing to a citisen were suable.

They were rare

16
because of the high immunity, official immunity.
covery was not always successful.

The re­

But from Little v.

Barreme, in 1804, to Yaselll v. Goff, Barr v. Matteo,
Howard v. Lyons, these cases all sued usually in the state
courts but sometimes transferred to the federal courts,
but there were these suits but they were not restricted
to the District of Columbia.

They were not mandamus

actions.
QUESTION:
cases, weren't they?

Both Howard and Barr were diversity
Perhaps Barr was a District of

Columbia general jurisdiction, but Howard v. Lyons was
diversity, wasn't it?
MR. BROWN:

Howard was.

That was in the

Massachusetts District Court„ Howard v. Lyons, decided
by Mr. Justice Harlan the same day as Barr v. Matteo,
but it was diversity.

I was simply showing that you

did not have a jurisdiction problem and you did not have
a venue problem, you did not have a service problem if
you are suing in the kind of cases that the respondents
are suing in, which are tort actions, even jumping over
the fact that Bivens type actions didn't exist at the
time.
I submit that a fair reading of the preferred
source, the House reports and the Senate reports on this
bill show that these were in essence against the United

17

States.

That was the keynote, and It was not in essence

against an individual.

There is a sentence, and this is

the heart of the respondents9 case, there is a sentence
that you will find in the middle of the House report and
you will find it in the middle of the Senate report, and
that sentence says --it talks about damage actions
against officials, and I submit that it involves the
venue problem that the committees were discussing, and
if you read the prior paragraph just once, and if you
read the paragraph after that, you will see that what was
being discussed there was the kind of an action which was
brought before 1962 very often and that is an action for
damages against a government official in his individual
capacity to circumvent what remained of the sovereign
immunity, and that it didn’t come out of his own pocket.
He was named.

It was a fiction.

But I assure you that

It is no fiction to be sued in one of these tort actions
that respondents have brought, where your mortgage is
up for grabs, where you have to go all over the country
to defend yourself and your personal reputation.
this type of pain and suffering that

It is

is entirely differ­

ent than if you have a mandamus type action where you
might not even appear in court, it goes in on affidavits
and it is a question of government policy and if you
change jobs, the next fellow has to follow the new rules

18
if there are new rul©3.
QUESTION:

But when you —•

Are you saying, Mr. Brown, that the

heart of the respondents* case are those two rather
errant sentences in the committee renorts of the two
houses of Congress, or rather isn't the heart of the
respondents' case the plain language of the statute as
well as what the Deputy Attorney General of the United
States told the committees the statute meant?
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

Which Deputy Attorney General?
The three of them.
Well, I don't agree, Mr. Justice

Stewart, that
QUESTION:

Lawrence Walsh, Aaron White and

Nicholas Katzenbach.
MR. BROWN:

Deputy Atrorney General Walsh I

submit was merely relating what kind of actions could be
brought.

He was making no recommendations.
QUESTION:

And how about Deputy Attorney General

White?
MR. BROWN:

Fairly read —- and I read it again

last night — fairly read, that letter of Deputy Attorney
General White says that it Is the understanding of the
sponsors that they did not intend a money judgment action
against officials.
QUESTION:

And if they enacted this legislation-

19
MR. BROWN:

And this legislation does not as it

is written — I am talking about the language of 1391(e)
and also of 1361» the whole statute, I don't believe that
that language does give the right to sue public officials
in their pocketbooks in every District Court from one end
of the country to another.
QUESTION:

Are you quoting the Deputy Attorney

General or are you speaking now?
MR. BROWN:

That is the way I interpret it.

What they were doing, viewed fairly at the time, they were
trying to be helpful and they weren't making recommenda­
tions, and I think if they recommend a certain procedure
that isn’t followed, that doesn't mean necessarily that
that is an agreement.

These were slender readings to turn

over and revolutionise what has been a rule of this Court
for 200 years, since 1789 it has been —

MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

Your time is expired,

Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Brown, before you sit down, I

was called out for a feur minutes, you may have covered it
then, but did you comment on the '76 amendment?
MR. BROWN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The '76 amendment

was — they found a difficulty in connection with the 1962
law and that is that in a judicial review type of action,
sometimes you had to bring in someone who was not a United

20
States official, you had to bring in a state agency or you
had to bring in, if you had a land action in Idaho —
QUESTION:

I understand all that, but where

does it leave you, with the ’76 amendment?
MR. BROWN:

Wall, the

amendment in reviewing

the mandamus Act of ’62 said that it was limited to mandamus
type actions, judicial review actions, and that is what it
said.

It said nothing else.

And there is nothing I submit

in the — my final remark, there is nothing about personal
tort actions in these reports and there is nothing about
civil rights.

There is a lot about land rights and grazing

rights, but nothing about civil rights.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Brown.

Mr. Peterson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DORIS PETERSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. PETERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is a civil damage action against four
federal officials.

They are charged with a conspiracy to

deny plaintiffs1 constitutional rights by a course of
conduct which included commission of perjury and the coverup thereof.

This case was filed in the United States

District Court for the District of Columbia, the district
where defendant Goodwin resides.

He was served personally

in that district.
The three petitioners here reside in Florida.
They are charged as co-conspirators.

where the real property is, or where the cause of action

are also federal officials.

of the United States, acting in his official capacity or
under color of legal authority, may be brought in any

You will see that in the footnote to the statute

We served the petitioners by certified

As the court below properly found, the statutory

mandate covers this case.
What this case is about is that, despite the
clear language of the statute, the petitioners asked the
court to read the words ”a civil action” as meaning a
civil action other than the damage action, a flaw in the
petitioners’ argument is not only that it ignores the
statutory language but also that It is inconsistent with
the legislative history.
QUESTION:

The legislative —

Ms. Peterson, what do you do with

Footnote *i in Schlanger v. Seamans which seems to suggest
that pei haps a literal application Is not required, inhere
it says this section was enacted to broaden the venue of
civil actions which could previously have been brought
only in the District of Columbia?

Noto* certainly previously

his was an action which could have been brought outside
the District of Columbia, i.e„, under ghe general venue
statute where all the defendants resided.
MS. PETERSON:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that goes

to the confusion which comes when you try to follow the
petitioners5 approach, because two statutes were enacted

25
at the same time* 1361 and 1391(e).

The part about pre­

viously brought only In the District of Columbia refers
to 1361, which was a subject matter jurisdiction statute.
QUESTION:

Then it was this Court that was con­

fused in Schlanger v. Seamans, I take it.
MS. PETERSON:

Let me explain that case a little

QUESTION:

Well, I am curious Just about what

you do with that sentence In the footnote which doesn't
refer to 1361 but refers to 1391(e).
MS. PETERSON:

Yes.

In the first place, this

Court did not have the advantage of briefing on the legis­
lative history of that statute.

There is one small

paragraph in the government brief on the legislative
history, and it Is just a reference to the House report.
There is nothing else in any of the briefs in Schlanger
about the legislative history of this statute.

MS. PETERSON:

Well, as a matter of fact, in

Monell last year, this Court reexamined the history of a
statute where it had more material available to it, and
I think that if the Court finds that inconsistent with
the approach that we take, they should reexamine it in
view of the totality of the legislative history which is
now available.

Also the ---

new.

MS. PETERSON:

Mr. Justice Blackman, the

memorandum from the Department of Justice, Nicholas D. B.
Katzenbach* s memorandum was not available until after the
decision in our case when it was submitted as part of —
it was lodged with the court as part of a petition for
rehearing.

The hearings below had never b^en published

and they were also made available after the decision in
our case, about three weeks before the decision — the
argument before the First Circuit in the Driver case.
QUESTION:

How about President Kennedy's

27
opinion of what the statute was meant to be, was that
available?
MS. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

Which opinion, Your Honor?

The opinion that Mr. Kennedy,

President Kennedy, the late President Kennedy expressed
the day he signed the bill.
MS. PETERSON:

Yes.

He said it was mandamus.
As to that, that incidentally

was recommended by the same Mr. Katzenbach who wrote the
memorandum which said that damage actions were covered,
and he did that because if you read the legislative
history carefully you will see that the Justice Department
was very concerned that 1361 would be interpreted to in­
volve the discretionary acts of high-level Cabinet
officials and they didn't want it so Interpreted, so they
wanted to be sure that it would not include more subject
matter jurisdiction.

1361 Is a subject matter statute.

1391(e) deals with problems of venue and personal juris­
diction.
QUESTION:

So you say President Kennedy's sign­

ing statement is perfectly consistent with your position?
MS. PETERSON:

Yes, It Id consistent with our
\

\

position.

If it weren’t, it wouldn’t affect the legisla\

tive history,

part of the legislative process, just the way Congress is.
In other words, a bill can’t become law without his signa­
ture, any more than it can by passage of both houses.

And

if houses of Congress by reports can make legislative
history, why can’t the President by a signing statement
make it?
MS. PETERSON:

I don’t think Presidents have a

I think a President has

One is to sign legislation, two is to

veto it — three, he can veto it and send it back and say
I will sign it In this fashion, but I don't think it is
important as far as our position is concerned, because I
think what President Kennedy said is perfectly consistent
with the purposes that we are suggesting here.

There were

several purposes to the bill, some related to 1361 and
some related to 1391(e), and in order to make all of it
consistent you have to look at all of these purposes,
otherwise you get in the position that the petitioners are,
wanting us to Ignore certain parts of the legislative
history and saying that they are confusing or this part
of it is wrong.

But —
%

QUESTION:

Ms. Peterson, could we go back to

Schlanger v. Seamans for a moment.

Now, you suggest that

the language in the footnote was more or less Inadvertent,
but the holding in the case was that the Air Force officer

29
could not bring a habeas corpus proceeding in the district
in vrhich his claim arose.

His contract for enlistment

had been breached or something.

And if a habeas corpus

proceeding is a civil action within the meaning of 1391(e)s
he should have been permitted to bring that action.

So

don’t you either have to say x\re should overrule that de­
cision or continue to accept habeas corpuses not being the
kind of civil actions that the statute refers to?
MS. PETERSON:

Mr. Justice Douglas, who wrote

that opinion, went on in the footnote to note that habeas
is a unique proceeding.
'•

QUESTION:

He cited the Harris case.

Correct.

MS. PETERSON:

He said that, ordinary civil rules

do not apply in habeas and also that it was a jurisdictional
matter which Is controlled by 27 U.S.C. 2241 —

But he did say and you apparently

accept that part of the opinion that a habeas proceeding
is not a civil action within the meaning of 1931(e) —
MS. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

y

— although literally it would appear

to be.
MS. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

You have therefore acknowledged, it

would seem to me, that this section cannot be read in its
full literal scope

30
MS. PETERSON:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor —

"And as soon as you acknowledge that,

then you say, v/ell, what else should be left out, isn’t
it conceivable that Congress did not intend to include
damage action?
MS. PETERSON:

There is a provision in the

statute, in 1391(©)» except as otherwise provided by law,
and we maintain that habeas is as otherwise provided by
law.

It i3 provided in the habeas statute which limits

jurisdiction of District Courts in habeas proceedings,
and therefore it Is consistent to maintain the Sehlanger
footnote.

The Court doesn’t have to overrule it if it

doesn't want to, can still take the position which we are
asking for here which is that in ordinary civil proceed­
ings that 1391(e) applies without restrictions.
QUESTION:

But the habeas language isn’t limit-

ing language,v There is another statute describing the
district in which it may be brought, and that is an otherwise authorized place to bring it.

Isn't it also true that

there is other statutory language which authorises this
action to be brought?

In other words, isn’t there another

section of the venue'action which would say this action
could be brought where the cause of action arose or where
all the plaintiffs reside?
MS. PETERSON:

The diversity section — the

federal question section —
QUESTION:

Correct.

MS. PETERSON:

— which has long applieds yes,

and it could have been brought under that only under that
section we could not have gotten a personal jurisdiction
over the defendants and we needed 1391(c) and its pro­
visions for personal service, the paragraph we could serve
them by certified mall in order to get personal jurisdic­
tion over the Florida defendants in the suit.
QUESTION:

Well, you could have served them

where the claim arose.
MS. PETERSON:

Yes.

The defendants in this case,

all of them, including Defendant Goodwin, moved for a
change of venue to Florida.

They made % 1*10*1 (a) motion

and the District Court denied thatmotloh.

That is a mo­

tion In the interest of justice, and h® looked at the
equities in the case and denied the motion for a change

diction over these people.
MS. PETERSON:

Not over Defendant Goodwin.

We

could have sued him totally without 1391(e) in the District

of Columbia.
QUESTION:

And you could have sued all of them

in the District of Florida, the Northern District of

community.

plaintiffs a choice of forum.

We chose a neutral forum In which to bring this suit and
we are suing in the District of Columbia.

ment defendant in the district where the claim arose, that

MS. PETERSON:

Congressman Budge had one Intention

when he introduced this statute, but Congressman Budge was
only one of the Congress people in the whole process.

Of

course, the bill that he introduced would not have per­
mitted this suit, but the bill went through an evolution­
ary change in the course of Its legislative history.

history, is it not?
MS, PETERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, he was talking

about the subject matter jurisdiction of courts, and we
do not maintain that 1391(e) added to the subject matter
jurisdiction of the courts.

Also Deputy Attorney General

White, in his letter you will see when he talks about
1391(e), that section of the bill, he says it deals with
an entirely different subject, different from 1361, fran
the first section of the bill which became 1361.

QUESTION:

This is the one that the Deputy

Attorney General had inmind when he said It was entirely
different from section 1, at least that is what his letter
said.
MS. PETERSON:

He says It is generally made by

an official residing in the District of Columbia, but in
passing this legislation Congress was concerned with
citizens all over the country and wherever the decisions
were being made and that the citizen would have the
choice, they would make government officials amenable in
four different places.
On page 11a, if you will go on, Your Honor, it
says, "The pending bill will place venue in any judicial
district therein the plaintiff resides.’"

And he was

concerned about such a general granted venue and he made
some recommendations as to how the plaintiff’s choice
should be limited.

Congress listened to him and they

36
narrowed It and they did not allow it to be wherever the
plaintiff resided.

They only allowed it to be where the

plaintiff resided if no real property was involved.

They

were listening very carefully to the opinions that were
coming from the Department-of Justice and responded to
them, but they did not react to the opinion from Deputy
Attorney General White that they should' tie this into the
Administrative Procedure Act In order to eliminate money
damages.

Yes.

That is what I thought.

There is a series of events

in the legislative history, five crucial events which are
all set forth in our brief and which I do not have time

to go through.

There is the first letter from the Depart­

ment of Justice making Congress aware of the problem.
There is the harlngs in which damage actions were exten­
sively discussed.

They were very concerned about damage

actions because Barr v. Matteo had just come down, and
though it talked about a scope of immunity, it talked
about also the outer perimeters of it, and they knew that
there could be such suits beyond the perimeters and also
-— then there was a redrafted bill in which they added the
very language which they were warned about, the "under
color of law" language, and they put in the House report
that the problem arises in damage actions seeking damages
from him, from the government official, not from the ;

acknowledgement that damage actions were covered written
by the then Deputy Attorney General Kat&enbach, who also
advised the President to issue that statement so as to be
sure that the powers of the Cabinet were not interfered
with.

We will not have time to deal with the issue as
to personal jurisdiction.

On that issue, I would Just

like to say very briefly that we have got personal juris­
diction by a combination of two things, Rule 4-F which
permits service beyond the territorial limits of a state
when a statute so authorises it, and 1391(e) is a statute
which authorizes it.
Vie also will not deal with the petitioners' due
process claims.

I Just want to say on that that the

government has conceded that the court below was right on
this issue and the petitioners have conceded that this
Court’s decisions in the International Shoe Company line
of cases do not apply to the extraterritorial — those
cases which deal with the extraterritorial assertion of
powers by states beyond its borders are not applicable

here, and we submit that the petitioners* argument about

of a constitutional argument.
Here in Shaffer,\what is discussed there relates
to the fairness of exercise of power by a particular
sovereign and here the sovereign Is exercizing its power.
