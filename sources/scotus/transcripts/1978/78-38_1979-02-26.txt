ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE J. COHEN, ESQ.9
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COHEN:

Thank you9 Mr. Chief Justice9 and my it

please the Court:
This is an action for breach of the duty of fair
representation under the Railway Labor Act®
Gourt9 the jury

In the District

found that the union had breached its duty

to Mr. Foust,, he was awarded compensatory damages of $^09000
and punitive damages of $759000.
in all respecte*

The Tenth Circuit affirmed

This Court denied certiorari on two of the

issues raised in our petition* whether the union had breached
its duty as a matter of law and whether the award of eorapensa■

fcory damages was proper*

;.Ty

The single issue on which certiorari

was granted was the propriety of the punitive damage award.
The basis for the lower court's finding that the
union had broached its duty to Foust was the fact that it
filed a grievance on his behalf two days after the expiration
of the 60«=day grievance period provided in the collective
bargaining agreement9 and that that was the basis of the

4
ultimate denial of that grievance by the National Railroad
Adjustment Boarde
The facts underlying the filing of the grievance are
basically undisputed and can be summarized briefly»

Poust was

an employee of the Union Pacific Railroad and he was repre­
sented by the IBEW for collective bargaining purposes6

In

March of 1970, he was injured on the job, he took several
succeeding medical leax^es of absence, the last of which ex­
pired December 229 1970.

He did, not file a timely request

for a further extension of his leave of absence, and on
February 3® 1971, the railroad wrote to Foust and stated that
he was discharged for his failure to do so and his failure to
submit a required physician's statements
Now, under this Court's decision in Elgin, Joliet
& Eastern Railway v. Burley, Foust at that point had the
option of proceeding on his own to file a grievance cr asking
that it be handled by his union or by an attorney0

He chose

to use the attorney who was then representing him in his
personal injury claim under the Federal Employees Liability
Act, and ©n February 11th his attorney wrote to the railroad
concerning the discharge.

The letter went unanswered and he

got no favorable response in two subsequent phone calls to the
railroad*
On March 26th, which was the 51st day of the griev­
ance period, the attorney wrote to the union and the union

5
representative Jones, and asked that the union attempt to
have Foust reinstated»

Jones considered the request unusual

since it came not from the employee the union represented hut
from his attorney, so he called his superior,

They discussed

the matter and concluded they needed an authorisation from
Foust himself to proceed, and the superior prepared a letter
for Jones to send to Foust„

He mailed that letter to Jones,

who dated and signed it, and he mailed it to Foust on April
5th.

In essence, the letter said "we need a written author-

ization from you to handle this matter on your behalf."
He didn’t wait- for a response, however; on the
following day, April 6th, he filed a grievance»
was two days after the 60-day period.

That, however,

I would like to mention

two other factual points»
QUESTION:

He knew that, didn’t he?

He knew that at

the time he mailed the letter?
MR. COHEN:
Marshall.

It is not entirely clear, Mr. Justice

In his deposition, he said ”1 feel at that time

that It was untimely.”

We don’t deny that he should have

known it was untimely.
QUESTION:

Well, it would have been horrible if he

knew it was untimely and then wrote a letter like that»
MR. COHEN:

No»

It is my understanding of the

record that he did know it at that time»

Foust admitted

that he made no effort between February 3rd, the date of his

6
discharge and April 5th to contact the union personally.

He

also acknowledges that there was no animosity or adverse or
bad relationship between them.

His only complaint ws.s that

the union was late in filing his grievance0
Now, our principal position here is that punitive
damages are not a proper remedy for breach of the duty of
fair representation, and that Is because a duty of fair rep­
resentation suit is one to enforce a statutory right and the
remedy for violation of that right must» also be drawn from
the statute.
Specifically, the question of whether punitive
damages are allowable in a fair representation case, we feel
must b® determined by the national labor policy, the best
evidence of which is found under the National Labor Relations
Act under which there are many more precedents than the
Railway Labor Act®
QUESTION;

In adjudicating this ease, do you under­

stand that we should do so on the assumption that there was a
breach of duty?
MR3 COHEM;

1 think you must, Mr. Justice White.

With the denial of certiorari upon that issue for purposes of
this Court, the —
QUESTION;

Let me ask you another question*

think this Is the same question*

I don’t

Do you think that there is

open in this Court the question of whether there was a wrongful

7
discharge?
MR. COHEN:

Let me try to answer that this way:

Foust settled with the railroad both for his personal injury
claim and waived any claim on wrongful discharge before this
suit was filedc
QUESTION:

I know, but how about the union?

I would

suppose that — I will just ask you this, do you suppose —
would punitive damages ever be -•» even if they were allowable
in a proper ease, would punitive damages be allowable if
there had been no injury?
MR* COHEN:

No, I think not.

I think that is the

very least that is clear from Vaca.
QUESTION:

What I want to know Is is the question of

wrongful discharge open here?
MR, COHEM:

We feel it is not open»

We must assume

that —
QUESTION:

We must assume there was a wrongful dis­

charge?
MR» COHEN:

I think so.

I think the union unfortu­

nately below did not accept to the Instructions that the jury
should not consider that issue.

We feel in a proper case, as

we read this Court's decisions, both elements must be approved.
QUESTION:

So we judge the case here on the assump­

tion that there was both a wrongful discharge and a breach of
duty?

8
MRa COHEN:
QUESTION:

I would think so, Mr. Justice White0
And we have to reexamine the compensatory

damages as well, would we not?
MR. COHEN:

If certiorari had not been denied on

that9 I would certainly think so.
QUESTION:

And it is your position, no matter how

malevolent or spiteful or deliberateful injurious the Intent
of the union was — although it may not have been in this
case *=- even if in some other ease that wer® proven, punitive
damages can never be allowed as a matter of law?
MRs, COHEN:

That is our principal position, just as

in a 303 aetion9 which is also an action for a statutory tort,
no matter how willful ©r even vicious, as this Court held in
Teamsters v. Morton,, only remedial sanctions are provided.
Of course, we d© make the alternative argument, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, that on the record on this ease, if the
Court does not accept ©ur principal position, the standard
used by the Tenth Circuit is far lacking the requirements ©f
the prevailing standard for punitive damages®
We submit, that on the principal position, the federal
labor policy which underlies these statutes is one of provid­
ing exclusively remedial relief.'

Under the National Labor

Relations Act, this was established as early as the Republic
Steel case we cite, where Chief Justice Hughes noted that the
Act contained only remedial and not punitive relief, and he

9
noted that the deterrent effect of punitive action was not a
sufficient justification for such sanctions.
Those principles have been reiterated through the
years, In this Court, for example, in the Carpenters Local 60
casej by you, Mr. Chief Justice, when writing for the D. C.
Circuit in the Ladies® Garment Workers case, which we cite at
page 15.
The same result obtains under the 5
the LMRA,

amendments to

1 just mentioned Teamsters v. Morton, which is an

explicit holding; also under 301, a breach of contract action,
where the leading case Is the BrooksShoe decision which we
cite, where Chief Judge Biggs, I think, succinctly summed up
both the correct result and the reason, for that result.

I

quote, "It is the general policy of the federal labor laws, to
which the federal courts are to look for guidance in section
301 actions, to supply remedies rather than punishments/'
Now, it appears to us that this Court reached the
same conclusion in this very context in Vaca v9 Sipese

After

noting that the jury there had awarded both compensatory and
punitive damages, the Court held "such damages are not recover­
able from the union in circumstances of this case."

The Court

then went on to discuss the fact that any compensatory damages
that were due if the union had breached its duty would have
been attributable to the wrongful discharge by the employer.
Now, the Ninth Circuit has interpreted Vaca as we

10
dos, as holding that punitive damages are strictly unavail­
able in fair representation eases»
QUESTION:

That is what the language you just re­

ferred to literally means then»
MR» COHEN;

Well, we offer, Mr» Justice White, two

possible explanations for that language in our brief»

We

acknowledge that an alternative basis may be that you may not
have them if there are no, almost no compensatory damages»
Vie think the broaden* holding is the better reading, but I
would certainly not argue with you as to —
QUESTION:

Well, Vaea said that damages caused by

the employer.
MR» COHEN;
QUESTION:

That is correct»
And a while ago you Indicated that you

dldn5t think punitive damages should be allowed if there were
no damages.caused by the person against whom damages are
sought»
MR. COHEN:

If the issue were open here, Mr. Justice

White, we would argue that the award of compensatory damages
against the union was plainly Improper.
QUESTION;
MR» COHEN;
QUESTION:
MR» COHEN;
QUESTION;

Well, that was the situation in Vaca.
That *s right»
And then you made the statement —
In effect» we made —
the statement that no punitive damages

11
In the circumstances of this ease»
QUESTION:

Because there were no damages in the

circumstances of this case,
MR0 COHEN;

That's right,

W@ think that Vaca can be

read even more broadly, yes, and the Ninth Circuit has read
it that way.

Obviously, of course, we point out that the

matter is open*
As far as the Railway Labor Act itself, probably the
most thorough analysis ©f its structure was provided by the
Third Circuit in the Debolee ease which we cite at pages 12,
13» 24 and 25 of our brief, in which after examining the
precedents under the National Labor Relations Act and the
structura of the Railway Labor Act, the Court concluded,
"There is no intention that the Railway Labor Act deviates
from this general pattern of remedies under the NLRA» at
least with respect to union misconduct,"
The gam© conclusion had been reached in another
Railway Labor Act case many years earlier in Judge Caleb
Wright’s decision in Brady vs TWA®

We think It is signifi­

cant, in looking at the Hallway Labor Act, that under the
provisions of section 2, Tenth, th© criminal sanctions which
are provided for willful carrier violations of five specified
paragraphs do not encompass th© duties which are declared in
paragraphs First and Second from which this Court has said
th© duty of fair representation arises.

12
We feel If the test Is the national labor policy,,
that the conclusion must be reached that punitive damages are
not allowable for any breach of the duty of fair representa-»
tion or wrongful discharges
QUESTION:
sitlon.

1 have a little difficulty with that po-

Perhaps the difficulty stems from my own lack of

understanding»

To me, those acts place the employee and the

union on one side of the fence and the employer on the other,
and when the Court has interpreted to say they are remedial
and you can only get e© much out of the employer by virtue of
the — but.when you are talking about a union which is basic\

"

•

ally supposed to be representing the employee*, It doesn't
seem to me to be that you would necessarily have the same
limits as you would In the remedies against the employer If
there is almost a fiduciary obligation involveds
MR. COHENi

W@lls we think again, though8 Mr. Justice

Rehnqulst, that you have to look to the scheme of the statutes,
and ©van when Congress amended the Act In '4? to provide union
■ ■ ':

■

i

unfair labor practices. It made no change in its remedial
policy»

And this Court?s decision in Carpenters Local 60, In

1961, was a case where a remedy which this Court held punitive
was imposed on a union based on its action vis-a-vis the
employees it represented, and this Court held the dues reim­
bursement remedy in that ease was punitive and could not
stand

13
QUESTION:

Well, does it necessarily follow because

a union can’t be punished for a vil ation of a practice made
unfair by the Act of 19^79 that an employee or employer can’t
be punished for the act ©f the ’35 isolation, that a union
representing an employee In processing a grievance can’t -Is likewise limited In the damage that can be awarded?
MR. COHEN:

We think that conclusion does follow, Mr*

Justice Rehnqulstg because the entire statutory scheme is one
of deliberately providing only remedial relief, and In that
ease where the courts have implied the duty of fair repre­
sentation, we think It would be a quantum leap for the courts
to provide something far beyond anything contemplated by the
Congress anywhere In this related group of statutes,
}

We think th® same approach or the same result ob­
tains under a different approach In more general statutory
approach which we suggest and which we draw from Judge
Parker’s decision for th© Fourth Circuit in Min© Workers v.
Patton*

We cite that In som© detail in ©ur brief.
We also in ©ur ruply brief ©It© th© Phelps Dodge

cass, where this Court held that even in the flagrant case of
a I&ellberatsly discriminatory refusal to hire based on union
membership, a violation that is both willful and one that runs
to the heart of the Act, n© more than a ’’may call" order was
appropriate.
We think under either the specific or th® more

14
general standard that we advance, the conclusion should be
reached that neither employers nor unions

in these wrongful

discharge duty or fair representation eases should be subject
to the threat of punitive damages.
Now, if the Court does not accept that basic posi­
tion that punitive damages are never available in fair repre­
sentation cases8 we think that the filing of the Foust
grievance two days out of tlm© is not Illegally sufficient
basis to support the award in this ease, and that is because
the prevailing requirement, as we understand it, for an award
of punitive damages Is some showing of malic© or willful or
outrageous misconduct as opposed to a showing of negligence.
QUESTION?

Is there any record of the grievance

being filed out of time and having been considered in this
particular shop?
MR, COHENj

I am not sure I understand what you mean

by considered.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose fifty times before the

grievance filed two days later had been considered, that
_

would be one thing.

.

.

<

If it was uniformly never considered,

vfouldn*t that be ©nought
MR, COHEN:

I don®t think there is any such showing

her©, and —QUESTION?
MR, COHEN:

Qn@ way or the other?
On® way or the other.

To the extent

15
that it is relevant» Jones» the first level representative»
testified that in his three years in that position he had
handled seven or eight grievances, each had come directly
from the employee involved, there was no indication that
there was any problem ©f timeliness, and he then went on to
state that it was because this case was different that he
took the time to check with his superior and the letters went
back and forth*
We have set forth a number of cases» including this
Court's decision only last term in Carey v. Piphus» which
seems to require» as we suggest» a showing of some scrt of
malicious intention or deliberate violence or oppression.
won't go into all of those h©r@e

1

They are set out in our

brief, as is Dean Prosser's work.
In fact» the court below seemed to be aware that it
was using a lesser standard than some of the other courts»
including those on which it purported t© rely, but it didn't
explain why its lesser standard might be correct*
Now, when it looked at the facts her®, the Tenth
Circuit noted, "The time available to the union was limited»"
and it was limited because Foust's prior attorney used up 52
of the 60 days available*

But the court nevertheless faulted

the union for engaging in what it called

needless corres­

pondence back and forth during the remaining ©ight days, and
for insisting on an authorisation from Foust.

16
So at most and In the Tenth Circuit's own view, the
union was guilty of negligence or an error of law or of
judgment which does not even approach the kind of

malicious

or willful misconduct which is required to support a punitive
damage award*
*

I would like to add a final word in that regard.

This Court's last statement on the duty of fair representa­
tion was in lines v. tosher Motor Freight, and one of the
«■

" - -v

points made inhere was that a mere error of judgment was not
sufficient to find a breach of a duty.

Well, w© may not

argue that here, but I would submit that if it is not adequate
to find a breach of the duty «°® and that is in essenea what
happened hero ~~ a fortiori is not sufficient to support an
*

award of punitive damages.
On either of the bases, therefore, we think the
judgment of awarding punitive damages should b© reversed®
And unless the Court ha® further questions, I will save my
remaining time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Very well, Mr® Cohen.

Mr» Mackey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERRI W. MACKEY9 ESQ.,
ON BEHALF Of THE RESPONDENT
MR, MACKEY:

Thank you, Mre Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The beginning point of the argument was Vaca v.

17
Sipes' statement "we hold that such damages are not recover­
able from the union in the circumstances of this ease.”

That

case, in the next paragraph, goes on to say*, "The appropriate
remedy for a breach of a union*a duty of fair representation
must vary with the circumstances of the particular breach,”
We rely in our brief on Textile Workers v® Lincoln
Mills, a case decided in 195?s and in that ease they went into
the statutory history ©f the Labor-Management Relations Act,
and admittedly the Aotshere, the Railway Labor Act and the
LMRA, are very similar in their approaches to the solving of
union problems®
But Lincoln Mills, like Vaca3 leaves it almost to an
ad hoe approach to each case for the District Courts®

There

is no guidance ©no suspects in later eases unless you can take
such eases as Hardison v. United Transportation Union9 a case
In which certiorari was denied in 19?^ in this Court,, in which
it was stated by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that
unless punitive damages ar© available an employee may lack the
strong legal remedy necessary to protect his rights against a
union*, which is either maliciously or In utter disregard of
his rights*, denied him fair representation.
To say that this Court then, when it denied cert,
did not have that issue before it to consider is one that I
cannot say tfas raised in the petition for certiorari, but I
can say it was certainly an issue in the case and appears to

18
have been decided by this Court at that time.
It would seem then that if In faet It is an ad hoe
approach that we must take, you must examine in each case* to
quote Vaca9 the circumstances of the case.
The union has always glossed over the real relation­
ship between Mr. Foust and the defendant in the court below.
The problems between Mr. Foust» as the record reflects In
each and every instance9 Is that in April of 1970» Mr. Foust
contacted Mr. Jones9 whose deposition was referred to in
prior argument.

Mr, Foust received no response to that and

indeed subsequently contacted Mr. Jones again In November
through his counsel® Mr. Moriarlty® who was then representing
him In the matter of his personal injury case with the railroad* asking why some action had not been taken on the 1970
written letter» which is in the record» to Mr. Jones.

N©

action tod occurred on that.
On Septesibor 8th9 meanwhile» the union was conferring
among Itself»

Mr. Wisniski, th© other defendant» and Mr,

Jones In fact were writing letters to each other about what
to do about Mr. Fousta

neither of them contacted Mr. Foust

until December 8th» however» and then Mr. Jones and Mr* Foust
had a telephone conversation in which Mr. Foust alleged that
Mr. Jones told him that th® union would do nothing for Mr.
Foust because h@ had retained counsel in hie PELA ease and
therefor© h© could take his counsel and d© as h© would with

19
his contract relationship with the railroad»
That is a dispute fact before the Court» but taking
the rule of the evidence most favorable to the prevailing
party9 that seems to be an appropriate fact.
The next item is that the railroad then became in­
volved with Mr. Foust and there were two pieces of corres­
pondence resulting in the February 3rd letter discharging
Mr. Foust.

That letter purportedly by the union to be only a

relationship dealing with a relationship between Mr® Poust
and the railroad., was the termination letter with copies sent
to Mr* Wisniskis the other defendant in the ease.

Conse­

quently, Mr» Wisniski -- and the record reflects this —
thereupon two days later — Mr» Foust was discharged on
February 3rda and two days laters on February 5ths Mr.
Wisniski again wrote to Mr® Jones* saying pleas® sand me all
that you have on this matter»

Promptly thereafter,, Mr® Jones

responded to Mr. Wisniski by sending him a copy of k leave
of absence form9 and that was all that lie had in his records,
Mr» Jones had In his resords relating to that.
Again9 the union had no correspondence with Mr.
Poust directly.

Subsequently, Mr® Moriarity thereafter9 the

attorney for Mr. Foust9 in an attempt9 believing that the
discharge was so patently wrongful on its face it could
©imply be resolved by confrontation with the railroad^ wrote
to the officer who had signed the discharge letter.

He

20
received no response.

Agains these matters are in the record.

He received no response.

He called that same officer, and

that officer said, well, this is a matter for the union to
take up.
Mr. Moriarity then, on March 26th

and that letter

is set out in a footnote in the opinion of the Tenth Circuit
— Mr» Moriarity then wrote to Mr® Jones of the union.
was either the 51st or 52nd day.

That

The record says 51» and

there is argument that it may have been the 52nd day, but in
any event we know that that letter was received — it was
mailed on the 26th of March, and that was taking the date
most favorable to the Jnion, even the 52nd day, and received
in Rawlins, where Mr. Jones was8 on the 27th, the 53rd day.
Mr* Jones promptly called Mr® Wisnlski, the other
defendant, and he said now what do 1 do, and Mr. Wlsniskl
promptly wrote the letter set forth of the 5th of April, one
day too late, saying <=- he typed that letter and he sent it
to Mr» Jones, and he said to Mr® Jones, "Now, you mail that
to Mr. Foust, saying we ar© not going to recognize his
request for us to handle his grievance.83
The simple fact was, that was done on March 30th®
The first correspondence relating to Mr. Foust9s grievance
was March 30thfl the 55th day, plenty of time In which to
obtain the necessary form, which was a very simple letter
saying — it was a letter addressed to Mr® H» M0 Robertson,

2.1

ifc is in the appendix to the brief, and it says, "We have a
grievance on behalf of Mr, Foust, that he was wrongfully
discharged, and we will send j?ou the details."

And so that

was a simple proposition.
All of this took place, again, between Mr, Wisniski
and Mr, Jones of the union, without contact with Mr. Foust.
Then, again referring to the relationship between Mr. Foust
and the union, at that point the letter of the 5th from Mr*
Wisniski to Mr, Jones says, "You had better send this letter,
the one saying we are not g©?„ng to represent you, to Mr,
Foust so we don*t get into litigation."

Then promptly there­

after Mr, Jones sends the notice of grievance to the rail­
road, and shortly thereafter, on the 9th of April, sends an
explanatory letter to Mr. Foust, the first writing of ex­
planation by the union from April 17, 1970, to April 9, 1971,
by the union to Mr, Foust,

That is the relationship that

existed.
In fact, the letter of grievance — I refer to it
as the letter of grievance — the letter to the carrier, the
railroad, is In the record twice.

It bears two handwritten

dates, each frifcten by Mr, Jones, both of them unfortunately
late, but one of them later than the ether.

The ultimate

decision was that the letter of the 6th, the grievance letter
of the 6th was the appropriate one.

There Is another identi­

cal letter in the record with a handwritten date that shows

22
it was mailed on the 8th»
The inferences that may be drawn from that are that
the relationship between Mr. Foust and his union was not quite
as simple as the union might want it to be or might conclude
it to be on the basis of those facts»

There had been prior

conduct between the union and Mr. Foust that would indicate,
according to the trial court's instruction one of the neces­
sary requirements, a wreckless, wanton disregard of the
rights of Mr» Foust, or oppressive conduct on the part of the
union as defined by the trial court, and the trial court —

QUESTION:

No, sir.

The question of —

Was it ever determined by anybody that

there had been a wrongful discharge?
to the jury, was it?

That wasn't submitted

2i|

MR, MACKEY:

No, sir, It was not.

In fact, the In­

structions —
QUESTION:
MR, MACKEY:

In fact, they kept it from them.
The instructions were to the contrary,

at the request of the union.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you think about — I am

just curious -» about recovering from a union substantial
damages, particularly punitive damages, without a determina­
tion that there had been a wrongful discharge?
MR, MACKEY:

I feel that Mr*. Foust should have had

the benefit of the determination of the wrongfulness of his
discharge.

I think we have to assume, though — and there is

an exhibit dealing with that in the record —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr, Foust, suppose there had been

determined :ln this case that there hadn’t been a wrongful
discharge but nevertheless a breach of duty by the union,
what would have been the damages?
MR. MACKEY:
suggested by counsel.

The damages would have been minimal, as
Defendants Exhibit Y, which is the

report of the Second Division of the Railroad Board of
Adjustment, which although not a complete determination on
the merits, says — it starts out by saying, first of all,
"This grievance was filed untimely" —
QUESTION;
MR. MACKEY:

Untimely.
"but there is a subantia! question

25
of the justice In this decision because of the merits."

And

so it would seem to indicate that — that was the union?s
exhibit «— it would seem to indicate that there was a meri­
torious claim here., although there was no determination of
that.

And that is the only exhibit in the record that would

refer to that»
QUESTION:

But apparently there was never any ob­

jection in this ease at all to the instruction of keeping
that issue from the jury as to the wrongfulness of the dis­
charge?
MRo MACKEY:

Nos sir.

I cannot accept the premise that a union would never
be entitled to have punitive damages assessed against it»
misstated that.

I

I mean to say that I cannot accept the

premise that a union somehow is isolated and may conduct it­
self in a vacuum without fear of retribution in the appro­
priate case3 and that is all punitive damages are, is a
retributive attempt by a civil plaintiff to deter a defendant
from subsequent conduct of the same kind»
There is nothing in the history of the Acts in ques­
tion here to indicate that such an approach is possible.
Indeed5 in Textile Workers v» Lincoln Mills, at page 195, I
believe it is — no, excuse me, at page 455, they were dis­
cussing the

the Court there is discussing the legislative

history, and Mr» Varden, of Congress, ina.de the statement, "Mr.

26
Chairinan9 I take this time for the purpose of asking the
Chairman a question.

And in asking the question* I want it

understood that it is intended to make a part of the record
that may hereafter be referred to ai3 history of the legis­
lation.

It is my understanding that section 302, the section

dealing with equal responsibility under collective bargaining
contracts in strike actions and proceedings in District
Court, contemplates not only the ordinary lawsuits for damages
but also such other remedial proceedings, both legal and
equitable as might be appropriate in the circumstances»

In

other words, proceedings could, for example, be brought by the
employers, the labor organisations or interested individual
employees under the Declaratory Judgment Act In order to
secure declarations from the court of legal rights under the
contracte
"Mr. Hartleys

The interpretation the gentleman has

just given of that section is absolutely correct,"
So the legislative history would indicate that ih
relationships between the employee and his union, nothing was
to be changed.

All of the rights and remedies granted under

the common law of this country xrould remain available, and
indeed other statutory remedies, such as the Uniform Declara­
tory Judgment Act in state court or as the federal statues
have adopted it would be available.
Sc that would seem to belie the position that at any

2?
time Congress ever attempted to immunize labor* unions from
the kinds of damages necessary to deter conduct under appro­
priate cases.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Mackey, is your theory that

the punitive damages can be awarded you under the state law
of Wyoming and that Congress has not forbidden it in the
Labor Act, or that your claim arises for any sort of damages
against the union, arises out of the Labor Act?
MR. MACKEY:

Our claim, because of the way it was

phrase, is what is referred to as a statutory tort under the
Federal Labor Act itself.

Now, this Court has decided in

previous cases that had it come up under a state cause of
action ~ and I guess now you are beginning to pick names,
how are you going to characterise this.
QUESTION:
names.

For instance —

I think it is more important than picking

1 had understood that your claim was based on a

federal statutory claim such as I understood Vaca v. Sipes to
be.
MR. MACKEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
But your last few sentences of argument

made me think that you were urging that this was sort of a
common law type of thing that Congress simply hadn’t pre­
empted .
MRo MACKEY:

Noe

I am suggesting that -- and the

purpose of that last quote was to suggest that In drafting

28
the legislation referred to and relied upon by appellant in
this case, they have misconstrued the legislative history»
The legislative history did not Intend to remove those civil
remedies that would have existed had the Act never been
adopted.

And perhaps I am not making myself clear on that,

but —
QUESTION-

Had the Act never been adopted, you

wouldn't have had any cause of action»
MR. MACKEY:

There would have been no statutory

tort, which brings me to the next point, that is -- again,
now, picking names.

There are almost identical cases in­

volving state courts, arising in state courts»

By the way,

Vaca v. Sipes arose in a state court action, but the
Laburnum case and the Russell case, cited in our briefs, and
most recently Parmer v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters, a
case decided in this Court In 1977

,

where the cause of action,

almost identical to the one which Mr, Foust has, was character­
ized as an outrageous conduct case, a tort, a state tort of
outrageous conduct.
Now, had Mr. Foust perhaps chosen to characterize
those same set of facts set forth in his complaint as an out­
rageous conduct kind of ease, then perhaps we would be here
under a different set of facts, and that is the question of
whether or not we would be under Wyoming state law remedies,
and under Wyoming state law remedies punitive damages would

29
be available under those circumstances»

But here we are

talking about characterising it.
It is the same set of facts, whether you call it
outrageous conduct on the part of the union or whether you
call it a statutory tort»

I mean, the statute does not say

that if the labor union fails to represent Mr» Foust, then
there is a cause of action»

These cases have all come up,

beginning with Elgin and Jolliet, cited by counsel for the
appellant, on the basis of an implied duty of fair represen­
tation, not written into the statute at all but Indeed aris­
ing by virtue of the fact that Congress took away from Mr.
%

Foust his right to bargain with his employer and gave that
right to the union»
QUESTION:

So it Is a state Implied right?

MR. MACKEY:
QUESTION:

1 beg your pardon, sir?
Does he have a state Implied right under

common law?
MR» MACKEY:

He would have a cause of action under

the facts of this case similar to that -QUESTION:
a union contract?

Would he have a state Implied right under
He ureuldn’t have that under common law,

would he?
MR» MACKEY:
QUESTION:
MR» MACKEY:

Oh, no.
I didn’t think he would»
The right here is one that this Court

30
has created , and consequently this Court has left us in the
position of adopting those cases like Vaca v0 Sipes in try­
ing to sort it out3 and again we come back to what appears to
be almost ad hoc an approach for the District Courts.

And the

problem that I have in that is that I do not believe that that
is what the subsequent cases would take us to, although that
is what the brief of appellant begins to lead us to0

And it

seems to me that if you adopt the position of Laburnum and
Construction Workers, United Construction Workers v. Laburnum,
and the Russell case, International Union of United Automobile
Workers v. Russell, where punitive damages were totally
allowed by the Court, the same is true in Carpenters, and
again we find the language and the facts of the existence of
. ?.

the punitive damages in Harrison v. UTU.
Harrison v. UTU is in fact a duty of fair repre­
sentation ease as they

are characterized out of the implied

right created by statute, also known as the statutory tort.
And so consequently, it seems to me that we have plenty of
authority and that the real question here is not whether the
Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in its opinion went far enough,
it relied upon the kinds of cases that are set forth in the
brief, but whether or not the District Court, in giving the
Instruction that it gave on the question of punitive damages,
was acting lawfully and in accordance with the law as it was
then constituted based upon the eases we have cited.

31
The record9 I believes justifies an award of puni­
tive damages in this case.

I do not believe that there is

any reason to believe3 based upon the cases that go before
that labor unions were ever immunized to the extent that they
might conduct themselves in any way they see fit without
fear of the usual remedies availables and consequently we feel
that the case was tried appropriately and that the Tenth
Cirtuit Court opinion is appropriate and correct and we would
ask the Court to affirm.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

furthers Mr. Cohen?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE J0 COHEN, ESQ.s
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. COHEN:

Briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like

to comment on two factual aspects.

My opponent has referred

to the matter c.f the 1970 grievance which Mr„ Foust attempted
to file.
Let me say at the outset that I think it has no
bearing whatever on the late filing of the discharge claim.
But I would like to clarify the record.

What is revealed is

that after his Injury in March of 1970, Mr. Foust was with­
held for several days from work by the company’s doctor and
he felt he should have been paid for those days.

He sent a

written grievance to the union, dated June 17, 1970.

At that

32
time, he did it by himself,
The union representatives, conferring among them­
selves, concluded that this was not a question of interpre­
tation of the contract but grew out of the injury claim which
had to be handled with an entirely separate department of the
railroad outside of the collective bargaining agreement or
under the Federal Employer’s Liability Act*,
In terms of whether Mr. Jones contacted Mr. Foust,
the record shows that he contacted him on two occasions by
telephone.

In his April 9S 19?la letter to Foust9 he refers

to the June 17s '70 grievance and notes that "I stated t© you
by telephone at that time that there are no provisions by
agreement — by the agreement for filing claims due to
medical reasons or Injuries,,”

And he suggested that this had

to be pursued under the FELA»

That is at page 14a of

respondent’s brief.
In Mr0 Moriarity’s — that is Mr* Foust’s prior
attorney — letter to Jones of November 198 1970 -- I’m sorry,
it is the January 119 1971 letter —* he refers to an addition­
al phone call between them on December 8th.

The only points

I wish to make ©n this are that the matter was not ignored and
that the union representatives concluded as a matter of sub­
stance that it related to a matter outside of the collective
bargaining agreement«
QUESTION:

Mra Coh@ns I notice on page 7 of the

33
appendix3 where the amended complaint is set out, that para­
graph one of the complaint Is phrased in terms of diversity
jurisdiction
MR* COHEN:
QUESTION:
diction*

That is correcto
*»- rather than federal question juris­

Do you think that a person in Mr, Foust8s position

would have a right to sue under diversity jurisdiction in
state courts for a common law type of breach of fiduciary
obligation?
MR. COHEN:

I would not think so0

a federal question type of jurisdiction.

I think this is

As far as the Farmer

case —
QUESTION:

Did the District Court recite on what

grounds It thought it had jurisdiction or not?
MRo COHEN:
QUESTION:
MR, COHEN:

Nos it did not*
I guess you don't —■
That question really was not raised any­

where below.
My only comment on what I think is a completely uni

table comparison with Farmer is to say that if one reads the
rather outrageous facts in that case against the failure by
two days to file a grievance on time here, the disparate of
the two cases is quickly apparent*
QUESTION:
cause of action?

Well, now, wasn't Farmer a state tort

34
MR. COKEN:
QUEISTJON:

Yes, it was.
The question was whether it was pre­

empted by the labor —
MR. COHEN:
vance here whatever.

Yes, that is correct.

It has no rele­

I was slightly offended at the com­

parison that this case is just like Parmer»

It Is radically

different.
Mr» Justice Rehnquists I would like to add one
further comment to the question you raised before by pointing
out that in a sense section 8(b)(2) of the National Labor
Relations Act likewise imposes a fiduciary duty on unions
vis-a-vis its members, and yet the same universally accepted
rule under the NLRA that punitive damages are not available
would obtain, and we go from there to the fact that under 303
as held in Morton and under 301 as held in Howard Johnston,
the remedial principles of the NLRA extend to the LMRA as
well*
QUESTION:

Your sections are too much — I am still

at the "Dear Sir" and "Brother" stage of my knowledge of labor
law»
MR. COHEN:

All right*

1 hope we can take it as

given that under the National Labor Relations Act as such,
the 835 Act, that only remedial relief is available»

In 19^7,

Congress amended that Act through the Labor-Management
Relations Act and it provided some new — first of all, it

35
provided a new set of union unfair labor praftices, including
8(b)(2) that they may not ask for the discrimination of
employee against employees on the basis of membership, and
it also added the 303 statutory tort, where there has been a
breach of the — or there has been a secondary boycott or
jurisdictional strike, the employer has that additional
remedy, but under Teamsters ve Morton only remedial relief Is
available, and also an independent breach of contract action,
and that is 301«
The only other point I would make is that we think
it is incongruous to suggest that a plaintiff in such a case
as —
QUESTION;

What about the 301 law, is it clear that

there are no punitive damages ever allowed?
MR« COHEN:

We think soe

There have been one or two

District Courts which at the motion stage have said we won't
rule it out.
QUESTION:
MR« COHEN:

This is against employers?
It could be against either.

Brooks

Shoe, interestingly enough, was a union suit against an
employer, but it works the other way as well.
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

And no punitive damages against employers?
I am not aware of any actual award of

punitive damages in any 301 case.
QUESTION:

Well, has It been raised and rejected or

36
not?
MR* COHEN;

It has — well9 it has been expressly

rejected by the Third Circuit in the Brooks Shoe decision that

I

we cite.

Two District Courts at the motions stage have said

we are not prepared to say they can never be awarded9 but
there was no decision on the merits of that question.
Our final point is that we think it would be incon­
gruous to allow a plaintiff In these cases to recover more
from his union in this situation than if the union had filed
a grievance and he would have been entitled to against the
employer itself*
Thank you.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you9 gentlemen*

The case is submitted.
