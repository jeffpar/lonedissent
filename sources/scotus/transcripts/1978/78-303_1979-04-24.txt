PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-303, Colby and Walters v. Driver, et al.
Mr. Nemser, I believe you can proceed whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL HAROLD NEMSER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NEMSER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I just want to pick up for a minute, since we
are talking about really the same issued, from what Ms.
Peterson just mentioned.

She talked about that one sen­

tence from the legislative history which Mr. Brown referred
to.

I dan't want the Court to be misled by the sentence

because the First Circuit was misled by it and the District
Court was misled by it, so let's read it.
It says the venue problem also arises in damage
actions against federal officials.
problem?

What was the venue

The venue problem was that certain suits were

limited to the District of Columbia only.

Right above

that sentence, it says the problem of venue in actions
against government officials arises when the action must
be brought against the official in the District of
Columbia, and the report says that venue problem also
arises in suits against federal officials for damages.

So, to understand ivhat Congress meant, we've got
to say, "Think.

Where did that venue problem arise in suits

against Federal officials for damages?"

Only in one type of

damage action; that type of damage action which was in the
nature of mandamus and which sought to compel payment of
money.
This Court referred to 1391(e) in South Carolina
against Katsenbach, I believe, and it said when you serve
Federal officials, you could now sue them outside of
Washington, D.C., and In a footnote it said, "See Stroud v.
Benson."
action.

Stroud v. Benson was just that kind of damage
It sought to compel a payment in the nature of

mandamus from a Federal official and that damage action was,
at the time this act was enacted, limited to Section 13dl(e).
And I think we had a serious problem that the First Circuit
and respondents read this one sentence in isolation and did
not read it in the context of the whole committee report.
QUESTION:

Mr. Nemser, before you leave it, is that

whole paragraph quoted in some of these papers?

I seen to

have missed It.
MR. NEMSER:

Well, the respondents quoted it about

every ten pages.
QUESTION:

But the whole thing was read.

Where is

that quoted?
MR. NEMSER:

Weli, the House import is attached to

our surpetition, if you have that.
92-A of our surpetition.

It will appear at page

If you look Just at the paragraph

above that, there is the venue problem we were talking about.
QUESTION:
MR. NEMSER:

Thank you.
I just want to spend another minute on

the clear wording of the statute which Mr. Justice Stewart
raised some question about.
QUESTION:

Before you go on, you said 92-A of your

cert petition-. I’m not so sure that that has what I thought
Mr. Justice Stevens was inquiring about.
MR. .NEMSER:

QUESTION:

does it?

MR- NEMSER:
QUESTION:

Well *. that is it, quoted; yes.
This is all quoted from 90-A onward —

MR. NEMSER:

Verbatim, yes.

MR. NEMSER:

The House report begins on page 89-A,

which is Appendix E.
The plain x^ording of the statute in our view covers
only actions in the nature of mandamus.’

When you sue a Federal

official in a civil action, acting in his official capacity
or under color of law, he is acting; he is acting like an
official and you need mandamus to force him to act correctly
or an injunction to stop him from acting improperly.

If you

need to sue him for damages, he has already acted; he acted a

6
long time ago, and now you want to get damages.
If Congress wanted to include damage actions, it
would have left out the phrase, ’’acting in his official
capacity or under color of legal authority,” and It would
have just said a civil action In which a defendant is an
officer, employee or an agency of the United States.
QUESTION:

It is that disjunctive ohrase that you

stated kind of sotto voce unon which reliance is had, or
under color of legal authority?
MR. NEMSER:

Yes.

report said about that.

Take a look at what the House

It was very specific; the Senate

report I think had the same language.
QUESTION:

Where do we take a look at it?

QUESTION:

Give us the page.

MR. NEMSER:

I am taking a look at it.

Page 94-A of the cert petition:"By including the
officer or employee both in his official capacity and acting
under color of legal authority, the committee

Intends to

make 1391$e) applicable to those cases where an action may
be brought against an officer or employee in his official
capacity,” and then we say, "What else did it intend to do?"
QUESTION:
MR. NEMSER:

You left out the "not only."
"Not only."

Now I say, It Intends to

Include also those cases where the action Is nominally brought
against the official in his Individual capacity, even though

7
he was acting within the apparent scope of his authority, and
then it says, "These eases

States."
The Driver case against Colby Is not nominally

It is not nominally against Walters.

They

They are in

essence against Colby's pocketbook and Walters' pocketbook.
QUESTION:

You said what they are basically is the

old Custis Lee Mansion type of case where you sue the official
but what you really want to do is avoid sovereign Immunity?
MR. NEMSER:

That is exactly what the committee

Veports indicate that was in mind, and they could nob- have
meant that these types of action were in mind.
one reason is that they did not exist then.

Well, for

But there is

not one mention of it.
tod If this is to be the most radical departure
from our rules of in personum Jurisdiction, and if Congress
intended to do this, there would have been a loud cry in 1962
and we would all have known about it.

It would have been

clearly expressed.
QUESTION:

There might not have been a loud cry, if

you are correct in your submission that these cases were very
rare in 1962.
MR. NEMSER:

I guess that is right.

I guess since

they did not exist, we really would not have even known it.

8
That means Congress had to have been legislating in this area
without knowledge of it, and that brings us to the questions
raised in NLRB v. the Catholic bishop of Chicago recently,
Swade v. Pressley.

Do we have a substantial constitutional

issue that must be avoided?
I think I have shown the statute susceptible to two
fair readings, at least.
QUESTION:

Is not the last sentence of that 9^-A

paragraph somewhat important here?

There is no Intention,

this is the committee speaking, I take it, to alter the venue
requirements of Federal law insofar as suits resulting from
the official's private actions are concerned.
MR. NEMSER:

And If you go back to, I guess, ex

parte Young, where they have the famous language, "When an
official acts beyond the scope of his authority he is stripped
of his official capacity.

He is acting like an individual."

In trying to get damage from him, you are trying to get
damages against him as a private person.
guage is .important-.
QUESTION:

I think that lan­

I think it is very Important.
Mr. Nemser, you suggested earlier that

if your opponent was correct,the Congress would have simply
omitted the ^/ords "acting in his official capacity."
MR. NEMSER:
QUESTION:

As a suggestion —
But had they admitted entirely, then

this would have applied to private litigation against a person
who happens to be an officer of the United States —

9
MR. NEMSER:

When you sue William Colby as

Director of Central Intelligence, you sue him as an official.
When you sue --QUESTION:

No, but the statutory language as you

suggested it would simply read, "a civil act in which a
defendant Is an officer or an employee” -- say William Colby
happened to be sued because he did not make his mortgage
payments or something like that.

The statute would then

apply to that situation?
MR. NEMSER:
that way.

I do not think it would have been read

So where do you go from there when you have

Justice Brandeis saying you have got to clearly express ex­
ceptions from our general rules of In personum jurisdiction.
To interpret Section 1391(e) this way, I want to
spend a few minutes on the constitutional issue.

It would

be the most radical departure from our traditions of In

jurisdiction in Hawaii and Alaska, in every State of the
country, even though they have had no contact whatsoever with
those forums, without regard to the question of whether or
not —■

Congress has that power, if it wants to.

It has that power in special cases -QUESTION:

Congress does not have power over the

jurisdiction of Federal courts?

QUESTION:
MR. NEMSER:

I do,
You say it is unconstitutional?

I

do.

You still do?
I still do.

This Court has never addressed it.

In Tole v.

Spray we were talking about whether foreign attachment could
be issued against a non~>U. S. domiciliary.

In Union Pacific

11
Railroad, a hundred years before Shaffer v. Heitner and just
after Pennoyer, we are talking about whether in one case the
attorney general could bring a suit against the railroad.

In

Mississippi v. Murphy we are talking about whether someone
could be sued in the Northern District rather than in the
Southern District of Mississippi.
We think that Justice Marshall’s decision in Shaffer
took care of Pennoyer, put to rest forever, and said that
terrlrorial power which the United States has over all of us
is no longer essential and sufficient for the exercise of
jurisdiction.

Now we have got to measure jurisdiction by

traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, and
we say that to make Colby and Walters travel to Rhode Island
to defend this suit would violate those principles and raise
serious constitutional issues, and because it would impose an
intolerable burden on the right to defend, the right addressed
in Boddie v. Connecticut, it would in fact violate Fifth
l

Amendment due process in this case.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Stillman.

OPAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. ELINOR H. STILLMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MRS. STILLMAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please

the Court, at the outset perhaps I should make clear this
does not go to the merits of the issue, but the United States
is paying for private counsel for the petitioners In this

12
case, but there Is no guarantee that the United States will
always do that.

In fact, there are some policy guidelines

that the Department of Justice has issued that can be found
In 28 CPR 50.15s and Section A(2) says:
’’Upon receipt of the ap;ency's notification of re™
quest for counsel, the Civil Division will determine whether
the employee's actions reasonably appear to have been per­
formed within the scope of his employment and whether provid­
ing representation is in the Interest of the United States.”
And these people have no guarantee that that determination is
going to be made in their favor, or that future attorneys
general will continue the policy, or that Congress will not
enact some law that would prevent it.
I would like to begin with Schlanger, because we
believe that this Court has in Schlanger determined that the
phrase "civil actions" in the statute does not shut us out on
this'issue.

In Sehlanger, the Court did have certain important

parts of the legislative history before it because in Footnote
4 it cites both the House report and the Senate report.
%

I an

*

talking about House Report 536 and Senate Report 1692, and
both of those contain this famous sentence we have all been
discussing here about venue problems in suits for damages,
and the Senate report contains Deputy Attorney General White’s
letter that the court below relied on and that respondents
rely on, and that did not prevent this Court in Schlanger
from saying, not respecting that habeas corpus could be

13

considered a civil action and says it applies to civil ac­
tions, we are not going to assume that Congress made this
sweeping change in habeas corpus venue.
Now, with respect to the question which I believe
Mr. Justice Stewart said when Haemer Budge was mentioned.,
is that not just the genesis of this legislation and did not
the Congress actually enact the statute later in 1972, do we
not have to look to the intent of Congress at that time.
I think the i960 hearings and what Haemer Budge
and his colleagues on that committee Intended are very im­
portant because, for one thing, the famous sentence we are
talking about here appeared in the House Report 1936, the
first House report that was issued right after those hearings
in that session of Congress, and that report evidently comes
out of what the committee learned in the course of the hear­
ings, determined in the course of the hearings.
If you go to the hearings, you will find — the
transcripts of the hearings -- you will find references to
damage actions In the very early pages of the hearings, there
is some sort of casual references to suits against Congress­
men for slender and suits against postmen who slap housewives
while they are delivering the mail, and so on.

But as the

hearings started to close, after they have heard the testimony
of Judge Albert Marris and the testimony of the Justice
Department representative and have considered all the problems

14
that they need to deal with here, Congressman Budge said at
the very close of the hearing» "People keep coming back to
these slander type actions.'*
script.

This is page 102 of the tran­

"People keep coming back to these slander type ac­

tions and that's not what I had in mind at all.”

He says

what he did have in mind was review of administrative action»
that the person out in Idaho can get that review without
coming to the District of Columbia, and when he spoke of his
Idaho constituent who had this problem that he wanted to
remedy by this act, Congressman Budge said, "This is a con­
stituent who wants to sue the Federal officer in charge out
there, end he can't sue the Federal officer in charge out
there because, the reason he can't is, if he tried to sue
Mm in mandamus, of course, only the District of Columbia
circuit bad mandamus jurisdiction at that time.”

And if the

suit somehow escapes classification as a mandamus action,
perhaps it is viewed simply as an injunction, enjoining him
from doing something, the Federal official In charge out in
Idaho could simply say, "Well, I am carrying out the orders
of my superior in Washington."

This would raise the in­

dispensable party problem and the suit would be dismissed in
Idaho.
Of course. If ~
QUESTION:

— was it not, where they dismissed the

action against the FBI resident agent in the District of
Illinois because tbs attorney general was regarded as an i

15
indispensable party?
MRS, STILLMAN:
Stroud v. Benson, also.

Exactly.

That is what happened in

This court's decision in Williams v.

Panning did not solve the problem.
But of course, if the citizen out in Idaho had
wanted to sue that Federal officer in damages, in the type of
damage suit that had arisen before this act was passed, these
were typically trespass actions, ejectment actions, false im­
prisonment.

They were commonlaw torts.

Nothing would keep

him from suing him. in the State Court of Idaho in which the
case might be removed to Federal court.

In fact, many of the

damage actions that respondents cite in their brief were
brought exactly this way.

U.S. v. Lee that they cite was

brought in the circuit county courts of Virginia and moved
to the Federal court.
So that cannot have been the problem that Represents
fcive Budge was concerned with.

Also in the hearings despite

these early references to slander type actions and postmen
slapping tli® housewife, Representative Dowdy who earlier had
in a sort of moment of, I think, irritation at the Justice
Department witness said, "Well, maybe we want to cover all
types of actions," later on Justice Dowdy being more fully
advised said, "I don't have in consideration that what we
have in mind here is money damage type suits."
Now, the question then I think 13 very clear from
reading these hearings that what these congressmen intended

16
was not the type of suit which the respondents have brought
here or the type of damage suits that existed against Federal
officials at that time.

The question then is, did that intent

carry over when Congress passed the mandamus and venue sta­
tute in 1962.
Now, the House report in 1962 that contains that
sentence that was In the earlier report is just sort of
verbatim carried over from the earlier report.

There is no

evidence that somebody sat down and thought about what that
sentence meant, any more than they thought — they carried
over the report in tofco.
I might say that the hearings throw some light on
that sentence3 however, because at page 87 of the transcript
somebody brings up the question of money damages -- Judge
Marris is testifying at that point, and he said, "Well,
there are some old damage type actions, they are suits against
collectors."

And he said you pretend you are suing the collec

tor individually but in fact he has recruitment from the
United States if he has just and reasonable cause.

It is

possible that the pe-rson who was directed to draw up this
House report, wanting to make sure that he includes in the
report everything that has come up in the hearings, which
Congress has not said, which the congressmen have not indi­
cated that they did not want to cover, saw that remark and
said the venue problem may arise sometimes in suits for
damages.

It is not —

17
QUESTION:

You are making a pretty strong ease for

not paying too much attention to legislative history,,
MRS, STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, I think it is —

I am not sure which is your objective.

MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, I think, Your Honor, that is

an explanation for that sentence, and it is an explanation
for the sentence which suits our understanding of the sta­
tute, that it refers to damage type actions which, as Mr.
Nemser said, are in essence against the United States, and
not the damage type actions which we have in this case which
do not employ a fiction and which are not in essence against
the United States.
Now, turning; to the phrase, "under color of legal
authority," this also came up during the hearings and it was
first raised by committee counsel Drabkin.

Later on it was

picked up by Representative Poff, because they had been
raising the problem of well, what do you do if the officers
are named individually, and Poff said why don’t we use this
phrase, .and Judge Maris again said yes, use that phrase,
that is a good phrase, because let us get down to what we are
really doing here, reviewing administrative action.
If they included that phrase they would also cover
those actions in which you named the Federal officer, pre­
tended to be suing him Individually, but what you were doing
was using the fiction of ex parte Young, the fiction which
the Larson court said was a way of getting around sovereign

18
immunity, but you wez’e still essentially reviewing action of
the Federal officer in not suing him for damages, you were
going after equitable relief»
And as Mr. Nemser has pointed out, the phrase ’'under
color of legal authority" is specifically explained in the
later House report.

They said what they meant by it.

What

they meant by it is what we say it means and we see no reason
that the court should adopt a contrary reading of it.
Now, concerning Mr. Justice White's letter, the
court below and the respondents assume that that letter is
essentially an ungranted request for a change in statute
with respect to damage actions.
fair reading of the letter.

I do not think that is a

The letter says there would be

less confusion If you did not use that language.

You could

make it absolutely unmistakable that money damage suits
against officers are not included, but the letter goes on to
say that this, we assume,-is in accord with the purpose of
the committee, of/the Congress.
yf/

Now, -i think Mr. Justice White had the better of
the argument.

It may be th

the Congress kept the phrases

in by pride of authorship or whatever other reason, and I
think Mr. Justice White, then Deputy Attorney General White,
had the better of the argument about what would have made
the statute absolutely clear.

But he was not — you cannot

read that letter to mean that he was asking them to make a
change which they then refused to make.
I

Now, as to the memorandum by Attorney General
Katzenbsichj, that is a memorandum which of course is not part
of legislative history.
passed.

It went out after the statute had

It went out under his name, it was a 7 page memo­

randum that went out to the various offices of U.S. attorneys
explaining the author of the memorandum1^ view of what the
statute meant.

There is no blinking the fact that it says

it covers libel and slander actions, and we think it is wrong,
that the legislative history is powerful evidence other­
wise —
QUESTION:

That is the memorandum referred to in

Footnote 34 of your amicus brief?
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And which you say at the conclusion

that the best explanation of this memorandum is that it is
wrong?
MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes, yes, Your Honor.

But it is

not part of the legislative history and it simply does not
have the same weight.

If Attorney General Katsenbach had

included that in a letter to the Congress

before the act

was passed and said, this is what we assume what you are
trying to do, and we do not want you to do it, and Congress
had then passed the act, I think we would not be here to­
day.
But that is not what happened.
QUESTION:

I would be surprised if you were not.

MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Well ~~

What category do you put the

President's observations about the bill?
MRS. STILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, the President —

You put It In as an appendix to your

brief, as I recall.
QUESTION:

It is on page 48.

MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes.

I think that Indicates the

understanding of the President and his advisers that what
he was signing was a bill which extended to other District
Courts the Jurisdiction heretofore enjoyed solely by the
District Court of the District of Columbia.

I think he

assumes, as we say the reports read, that this bill
including the venue section is only concerned with the
types of suits which could formerly have been brought in
the District of Columbia.
Now, something has also been said about the
letter that Lawrence Walsh, Deputy Attorney Walsh wrote
to the committee.

This was very early.

to put that In perspective.

I think you have

Deputy Attorney General Walsh

bill won’t do what you want it to do because it won’t ex­

brought against federal officers individually, one of
which was damage suits, the other of which were injunction

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN L. WULF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WULF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The argument has been proceeding in a very abstract
kind of way and I would like to introduce a little concrete­
ness to it for a moment, if I may.

I want to remind the

Court what this suit is about and what the issues and prob­
lems are confronting the plaintiffs.

23

The suit grows out of a massive twenty-year pro­
gram by the Central Intelligence Agency to secretly open
first class mail sent to and from the United States.

And

from 1953 until 1973s in the course of implementing that
program, the Central Intelligence Agency, their officials
and officers opened about 215,000 pieces of first class
mail.
QUESTION:

You say to and from the United States.

I suppose there is a great deal more than 250,000 letters
over even a year, wouldn’t there be?
MR. VJULP:

There are many more.

QUESTION:

This was focused in certain nlaees,

MR. WULF:

They were letters going to and from

was it?

the Soviet Union predominantly, Your Honor, yes — 215,000
letters in the course of twenty years, no warrant, no
permission, no consent, flagrantly in violation of the
Constitution, twenty years of lawless conduct, no question
about it, established beyond per adventure in the Church
committee report and in the Rockefeller committee report.
What this suit — this suit was filed on behalf
of a class of people whose mail was opened for the puroose
of compensating them for the flagrant violation of their
constitutional rights, the violation of the Fourth Amend­
ment and also to deter hopefully repetition of this same

24

kind of flagrantly lawless conduct by these defendants in
the future or by their successors.
The question in this case then, as it arises in
this so very abstract context, has a very concrete founda­
tion to it, and the question is whether the parties who
were injured in this constitutionally fundamental way may
seek vindication conveniently in a place in a jurisdiction
of their selection, in the jurisdiction where they reside,
or whether vindication of their rights is to be made
difficult, difficult by requiring them to chase defendants
all around the country and try to track down those who
they believe were responsible for the violation of their
constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

Do you think this process could be

followed constitutionally during wartime?

■

MR. WULF:

Opening the mail?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WULF:

It was done during the Second World

War and I think the conditions would be so different that
there might .well--be an argument for it, but it has no ap­
plication at all in the context of this CIA program which
was not conducted during wartime, and which has been con­
ceded by the United States, in fact, illegal and in viola­
tion of the Constitution.
QUESTION:

My inquiry on this was to further ask

25
what provision of the Constitution if, as you imply, it
might be valid in wartime, what provision of the Constitu­
tion would render it valid during wartime and render it
invalid —
ME. WULF:

It might be that people wouldn’t

object, that there might be consent, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But that; Is not a constitutional —

MR. WULF:

But there Is no consent in this case.

QUESTION:

But that is not a constitutional

proposition.
MR. WULF:
Honor.

The war power might Justify it. Your

But still it has no application here because

there was no war under way and this Court said in Ex Parte
Jackson over a hundred years ago and reaffirmed here In
United States v. Van Luan several years ago, that opening
mail without a warrant is a violation of the Fourth
Amendment.

This was not a wartime situation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wulf, 1391(b), as I understand it,

would not require you to follow the defendants to where
they live, you could have sued where the claim arose.
MR. WULF:

Could have done that, Your Honor,

and that raises the question about the kind of case that
this is.

This is a big case.

This is a case which is

being prosecuted on the plaintiffs’ side by the ACLU with
no expense to the parties, the party plaintiffs, and it is

26
being prosecuted and being defended on the defendants’
side by the United States at no expense to the defendants.
It is perfectly true that in this case we might have
brought this action where the cause of action arose, al­
though I am sure the defendants would find some objection
to that also.

That would have been in the Eastern District

of New York where the program was largely implemented.
But this is not the paradigmatic case.

This is a big case.

I would pose to the Court, the paradigmatic case,
even the small case, where the plaintiff has much less of
a chance, where his constitutional rights were violated —
QUESTION:

You keep saying big case.

Why did

you bring it in a small state?
MR. WULF:

Well —

QUESTION:

It is the smallest, isn’t it?

MR. WULF:

The actual answer is, if you want an

actual answer, is that the first complaint that we re­
ceived was from Dr. Rodney Driver who lived in Rhode
Island and we decided to bring it there.

We did not think

it was an inhospitable forum, as a matter of fact.

But

the case I put is the smallest case where a plaintiff is
on his own and where expense and convenience is very
critical to him.

If he has to go to New York, if Mr.

Driver had to come down and litigate this in New York all
by himself at his own expense, from Rhode Island, it is

2?
unlikely that he would do it,
QUESTION:

Well, your venue statutes are tradi­

tionally defendant oriented in civil cases, aren’t they?
It seems to me that both sides argue here on the basis of
kind of special circumstances that should be read one way
or another.

I don’t think we can take the fact that it

is a small case or a big case or that the government is
paying somebody’s expenses is really controlling of the
meaning of 1391(e).
MR. WULF:

Do you?
You are quite right, of course, that

venue statutes are traditionally drawn to assist defendants.
In this case, Congress expressly said that the purpose of
this one was to assist plaintiffs.

The Senate report

says that the purpose of 1391(e) is "to provide readily
available inexpensive judicial remedies for the citizen
.who is aggrieved by the workings of government."

In these

kinds of cases, where it was the government on one side
inflicting injury on citizens and residents on the other
side, Congress made this conscious determination that it
was going to shift the balance of convenience where venue
and jurisdiction was concerned and was going to simplify
the process for the plaintiffs and impose what additional
burdens might be necessary upon the defendants.
QUESTION:

But don’t you think the reading given

it in Sell longer v. Seamans i\fas such a shift, although it

28
doesn’t shift it enough for you?

MR. WULF:

Well, I think Schlanger is wrong.

There Is another explanation for Schlanger, too, because
the statute, 1391(e) does of course say that it applies
except as otherwise provided by law.

There is a very long

— it doesn’t say by statute, it says by lav;.

There is a

very long tradition In habeas corpus, of course, for
hundreds and hundreds of years, back I am sure to England.
The habeas jurisdiction lies only where the petitioner is
held In custody and that is as otherwise provided by law.
So there are many aspects of civil procedure which do not
apply to habeas proceedings because if they are special —
because of their special character1stics, this is just
another example.
QUESTION:

The venue statute was changed in the

last twenty or twenty-five years to make it -- you have to
go back for the sentencing judge rather than where the
s
custodian is for federal habeas, don't you?

MR. WULF:

That is the —

QUESTION:

No, that is 2255.

MR. WULF:

2255, where federal prisoners are

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WULF:

And this Court upheld that and is a

concerned.

departure frail traditional habeas practice, but it was

29
made explicit by Congress, an explicit change by Congress.
There is no explicit change here in 1391 making it apDlicable to habeas and prior practice and tradition controls.
If that is not sufficient explanation, then it is wrong
and ought to be changed in this action.
QUESTION:

You don't mean the decision in

Sehlanger is necesarily wrong, you are talking about the
accuracy of that footnote?
MR. WULF:

The footnote, yes.

QUESTION:

If the footnote is wrong, you have

to decide the case the other way.
MR. WULF:

No, because

QUESTION:

Because if 1391(e) applied —

QUESTION:

No, because of his, first explanation.

MR. WULF:

Habeas is a —

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

MR. WULF:

I am not going to review the whole

legislative history, I assure you.

I do want to say that

we continue to place confidence in that reference in the
committee reports which refers to the venue problem also
rises in action against the go\rernment official seeking
damages from him for actions which are claimed to be with­
out legal authority but taken in the course of performing
Ms duty.
Mr. Nemser would have you relate that very

30

intimately to the preceding paragraph, but I can split
hairs as well as the next lawyer, and there has been much
of that today.

It doesn’t say the same venue problem, it

doesn’t say that venue problem, it says the venue problem.
That is a different venue problem and it refers explicitly
— I withdraw explicitly —- arguably to the problem before
us today.
I think the use of the phrase "under color of
legal authority" is very telling in support of our argument
because that is, of course, the expression always used to
impose personal liability upon government officials when
they violate constitutional rights under the Civil Rights
Act and elsewhere.
The i960 subcommittee hearings, I am quick to
confess, can be read and are being read by both sides for
their own support.

I think there is sufficient reference

in there by various Congressmen to indicate an interest
in simplifying the process whereby plaintiffs, injured
citizens can seek vindication of injuries inflicted upon
them by government officials to support our position.
I think those letters by Mr. Justice White when
he was Deputy Attorney General and the other two Deputy
Attorney Generals are very influential because they are
contemporaneous.

They show what was in the minds of those

members of the Department of Justice who were at the time

31
concerned with what this meant.
QUESTION:

But they weren't passing any legls-

MR. WULF:

I'm sorry?

QUESTION:

They weren't passing any legislation.

MR. WULF:

They were asking that it be changed

lation.

and it was not changed, Your Honor.

That is —

QUESTION:

Well, they weren't passing legislation.

MR. WULF:

They surely were not, but they were

trying to -QUESTION:

So the Attorney General after the Act

was passed had no place in legislative history.
MR. WULF:

Correct?

Correct 9 but it certainly shows what

he thought it meant.
QUESTION:

Do you have a hypothesis, Mr. Wulf,

as to what was in President Kennedy's mind or in the mind
of the person who wrote Ms statement at the signing day?
MR. WULF:

I don't, really.

I think that whoever

it was that had him — it may have been —■ I can't remember
t

whether it was Mr. Katzenbach or Justice White who might
have submitted that to Mm, but I Just don’t know.

He was

obviously trying to make a case.
QUESTION:

It is an elusive enough subjeet for

lawyers, and is there a reasonable basis for a presumption
that President Kennedy didn't sit down with his pen and

32
think this whole thing up on his own?
MR. WULF:

I think we can assume that he did not

think it up on his own or think of it at all
QUESTION:

perhaps.

On the basis of then Deputy Attorney

General Katzenbaeh's note to the Director of the Bureau of
the Budget, whose name in those days was Bell, saying
accordingly we suggest that the President may wish to
issue an announcement at the time he signs the bill making
it clear that he considers the limited purpose controlling.
That is on page 48 of the government's brief, indicating
pretty definitely where the President's statement came
from.
MR. WULF:

You Just can't change the legislative

history and the legislative intent.

There can be a kind

of statement of hope perhaps, but
QUESTION:

Well, all it shows' is that we have

legislative history which is perhaps more confused than
usual, is it not unreasonable —
MR. WULF:

There is some confusion there and some

conflict there surely, and one would be less than frank
if one didn't admit it.

That is why — but there i3

enough on our side I believe to support our reading of
the statute as a very, very reasonable interpretation of
what we propose to the Court.

But I think that that also

can be informed by the Court's interpretation — that the

33
Court’s interpretation can be informed by the beneficial
purpose which 1391(e) will perform if it is read as we
propose that it be read, and that of course is to simplify
the process whereby citizens and residents of the United
- States can increase the quality of their access to the
courts in order to have their rights vindicated.

And

Congress, as I read a moment ago, said that one of the
purposes of this was to facilitate, was to simplify that
particular process.

And it is important it seems to me

to serve that purpose here, because what we have is a
direct clash -- this isn’t a case between opposing private
parties.

It applies in cases where government officials

are charged with official misconduct.

The court can de­

cide whether it wants to make it easier or harder for a
— it can partially base its decision In this case, its
construction of the statute on whether it wants to make
it easier or harder for plaintiffs to get the kind of
recompense which they are seeking in this case.

And that,

of course, goes to the constitutional issue, too, as Mr.
Nemser argues, that this is essentially a balancing of
the equities.
I do not think myself that -- I think the equi­
ties are all with the plaintiffs in these kinds of cases
and that the defendants are not being treated unfairly If
i

you do read this statute as we propose it be read, and the

34
reason is that thsse defendants are not your rul-of-themill private party defendants.
QUESTION:

Wei?., do you have any doubt about the

constitutionality of this statute that would require any
defendants sued in the United States District Court to be
sued where Congress provided?
MR. WULF:

I have no doubt at all in my mind.

QUESTION:

So long as it is Inside the United

MR. WULP:

Yes, that is where the United States

States.

District Courts are.

But should the Court or any of its

members have any doubt, I would simply say that when a
public official, when an individual chooses to become a
public official, he chooses to occupy high office, he takes
an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution and then Is
charged with violating that high oath, as they are in this
case, that they have assumed the risk, if you will, of
being sued one place or another, wherever it is that their
i

official misconduct inflicted the particular injury.

And

it is not unfair, and, of course, it is not particularly
unfair in this case because the greatest burden of litiga­
tion for any of us is the cost of attorney fees, the cost
of counseling and all of the opinions in this ease —
QUESTION:

Have you ever paid a Judgment recently?

MR. WW:

The will be a judgment against them

35
whether they are assued around the corner from where they
live or whether they are sued 500 miles away.
make any difference.

That doesn't

The question is the additional ex­

pense of trying to avoid that.

And it can often, as we

know, cost more to avoid it than the judgment would have
cost them in the long run.
QUESTION:

But they are going to have to pay

attorney fees wherever they are sued.
MR. WOLF:

These defendants are not paying a cent

in attorney fees , have not paid a cent in attorney fees and,
as far as I can tell, will not pay a cent in attorney fees.
QUESTION:

I don’t see how your argument cut ones

way or the other.
MR. WULF:

Well, what I am saying is there is

no great burden on them in being sued elsewhere, some
place else than where they live.
QUESTION:

That is what I am saying.

That is because of the present policy

of the Executive Eranoh of government, at least inferentially endorsed by the Appropriations Committees, but that
policy might change.
MR. WULF:

It might be changed, but —

QUESTION:

The Department of Justice has had a

variable policy on representing committees of the Congress,
for example.
represent them

Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't

36
MR. WULF:

It could be changed.

As Ms. Peterson

says, It has been the policy for a hundred years.

If they

are paying the defendants’ expenses in this case. Your
Honor, I can't think of a case where they wouldn't pay
them because this is a case — to go off the record for a
moment — in drawing upon the Church committee report and
the other official reports, we know this program went on,
we know a lot of these people were involved in it, and
still they are paying the fees.

So if they are paying it

here, as I say, it seems to me they would pay it in any
other case.

So it is not unfair to them.

QUESTION;

Mr. Wulf, the main objection in venue,

I suppose, if you are going to have a long trial and you
live in California and are sued in New York, you have got
to spend a couple of weeks in New York during the trial
and that Is sort of an inconvenience if you are in business
in California.

That is why the defendants are interested

in being sued in their residence, is not to have to spend
a lot of time and money to be elsewhere litigating.

I

don't think attorney fees, judgments or anything, it is
just where you are going to have this trial.
MR. WULF;

A couple of weeks inconvenience to

stand trial «—
QUESTION;

The whole purpose of venue Is to

vindicate that very interest.

That’s why we have venue

37
statutes.

We don’t just say sue anybody wherever you feel

like it.
MR. WULF:

YOu are quite right, Your Honor.

Of

course, on the other hand, if we serve the defendants’
interests here, we have to disserve the plaintiffs' in­
terests and I think that this was a statute which was in­
tended to serve the plaintiffs' interests and to put the
defendants to the necessary inconvenience that might flow
*

because of their assumption of special responsibility as
government officials,
QUESTION:

But there are always more burdend on

the moving party, the initiating party than on the
responding party in terms of burden of proof and a whole
lot of ether things, are't there?

The party who initiates

carries a large burden of proof, expense, the whole —
these things aren’t really, except the venue aspect, who
is paying the defendants’ fees and who will pay the
!

judgment perhaps is really not relevant to the basic issue
here, is it?
MR. WULF:

I think it has sonte bearing on it,

Your Honor, yes, certainly as to the constitutional argu­
ment because I think that the weight of the burden can
determine whether a particular practice is fair or not
fair,

Eera the burden I think is minimal.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
further?

Do you have anything

You have —
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL HAROLD NEMSER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS--REBUTTAL
MR. NEMSER:

I would just like to point out one

thing that Mr. Driver would find it so burdensome to move.
He did sue in the Eastern District of Now York under the
Federal Tort Claims Act for the same facts and did

get

recovery, so it wasn’t so tough for Mr. Driver.
Insofar as the acts of the petitioners in this
ease, I hesitate to go into the facts but Mr. Wulf went
beyond the record.

We know from the Rockefeller Commission

report and the Senate subcommittee report that Walters
didn’t know about the mail intercept program until it was
ended, and Colby is the one who stopped it and he knew
about it a week before he stopped it.

And to make people

travel around the country because they stopped a program
because Rodney Driver wants to bring them all up in front
of Judge Pettine in Rhode Island seems to be not to be
the purpose of this statute.

,

And on attorney fees, they are not all being
paid.

Patrick Gray is being sued in New York as an of­

ficial, and he is net being paid.

And if you act beyond

the color of your authority, you can’t be paid by the
United States.

The regulations provide for that, and

39
that is what Mr. Wulf alleges in this case.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 3:09 o'clock p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.,)
