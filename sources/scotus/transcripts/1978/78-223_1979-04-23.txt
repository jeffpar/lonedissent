PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in National Labor Relations Board v. Baptist Hospital.
Mr. Come, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COME:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the Sixth
Circuit and it involv .s the application and the principles
for determining the validity under the National Labor
Relations Act of rules barring employee union solicitation
and literature distribution in hospitals which were
enunciated by this Court's decision in Beth Israel Hospital

j

last term.
t

The facts are briefly these :

Baptist Hospital

is a nonprofit hospital located In Nashville.
patient beds and more than 1,800 employees.

It has '600
For a number

of years prior to October 197^, the hospital maintained a
rule which prohibited anyone to solicit patients or ;
visitors while on hospital premises without written approval
of the administration.
In August of 197*1, Congress enacted the Health
Care Amendments to the National Labor Relations Act,

4
bringing nonprofit hospitals under the Act’s coverap^e,

In

response to these amendments and to the fact that the union
had begun a campaign to organize the hospital's employees,
the hospital, after consulting with its lawyers but not
with any doctors, issued in October 197*1 a revised rule.
The rule provided in pertinent part that no solicitations
of any kind, Including solicitations for union membership,
will be permitted by employees at any time, Including work
time and non-work time, in any area of the hospital which
is accessible to or utilized by the public.

Solicitation

was barred in other areas by employees who are supposed to
be working or when conducted in such a way as to interfere
with employees who are working.
The effect of this rule is to bar employee solici­
tation and literature distribution in such public areas as
the hospital’s cafeteria, gift shop, lobbies, public rest
rcems, entrances, and even the parking lot across tile
street from the hospital, and to confine such activity to
non-public areas which were not or where not all of the.
employees were accessible.
The board, upon charges filed by the union,
concluded that the revised rule violated section 8(a)(1)
of the Act to the extent that it prohibited employees from
soliciting the union during their non-work time in areas
of the hospital other than immediate patient care areas.

5
The board, in short, followed its decision in St. John’s
Hospital that held that while a hospital could lawfully bar
employee solicitation or literature distribution in im­
mediate patient care areas, such as the patients5 rooms,
operating rooms and therapy rooms, a bar on that activity
in other areas was presumptively invalid absent a showing
by the hospital that it was necessary to avoid disruption
of patient care.
And the board adopting the findings of the
Administrative Law Judge, concluded that the hospital had
not made that showing of special need here.

The Sixth

Circuit in a decision rendered before this Court’s decision'
*

in Beth Israel denied enforcement of the board’s order.
The Sixth Circuit found that the testimony by the hospital
and two doctors as to the necessity for creating and main­
taining a tranquil atmosphere throughout the hospital for
patients and visitors was sufficient to establish special
circumstances that warranted the hospital’s restriction
of employee solicitation and distribution in these public
V

f

areas.
We submit that the Court of Appeals erred in not
applying the principles that this Court enunciated in the
Beth Israel case.

In Beth Israel, the Court held that the

Board’s general approach of requiring health care facilities
to permit employee solicitation and distribution during

6
non-working time in non-working areas, that the hospital
had not justified the prohibitions as necessary to avoid
disruption of health care operations was consistent with
the Act.

And the Court went on to find that the Board had

reasonably applied that principle in concluding that the
hospital had over-stepped the line in prohibiting the
employee solicitation in its cafeteria which was used pri­
marily by employees, but also by patients and visitors.
Nov;, this case differs from Beth Israel in that
it involves not only the hospital cafeteria but other public
areas accessible to the patients and their families.

In

addition, as I indicated, there v;as testimony by the
hospital administrator and two of its doctors in an ef' rt
to justify the rule.
Now, let’s look at the facts here.

The hospital

cafeteria here is essentially similar to that in Beth
Israel.

The hospital's study of cafeteria usage is not as

detailed as it was in Beth Israel, however, it shows that
the employee usage was nonetheless substantial —■ 68 per­
cent on weekdays and at least 47 percent on weekends, at
least those that went through the line.
The percentage of patients in the remaining 32
or 53 percent of the cafeteria’s patrons is not shown by
the hospital's study, but there is testimony in the record
to indicate that only a 3mall percentage of the patients

7
use the cafeteria.

Most of them obtain their meals in

their rooms and they only go down to the cafeteria if they
receive special permission to go down there.
QUESTION:

Mr. Come, what significance is your

reference to special permission?

Of course, that is

routine in a hospital.
MR. COME:

Well —

QUESTION:

I just wonder why you are emphasizing

that.
MR. COME:

ell, I am emphasizing it to show

that there is nothing in this record to indicate that the
use of the cafeteria was a predominant part of the hospital’s
therapeutic treatment, that the cafeteria, the testimony
shows, was primarily a place of the employees, where they
took their breaks and went ,tc relax.
/

QUESTION:

Wouldn’t the special permission be

relevant to the question of whether the patients who went
to the cafeterla/vvere at least thought to be well enough
s

to associate with the public as opposed to the sicker»

/
people?
/
■.■

'MR-.—COME.:

That’s correct-And, .-here , as in Beth

Isra'el', the same fact is present.

Similarly, the other

public areas in which employee solicitation and distribution
was barredNare areas which the hospital did not consider

\

to be /patient care or work areas.

There is testimony by

8
the hospital administrator*, Dr. Victory, to the effect
that none of these areas were regarded as a work area or
an area of patient care or treatment.
QUESTION:

You are using the Labor Board's

definition of patient care, aren't you, Mr.

Come?

MR. COME:

Well —

QUESTION:

The doctor’s testimony quite explicitly

associated patient care with some if not all of these public
areas and that testimony was undisputed.
MR. COME:

Well, in going by the testimony of the

hospital administrator —
QUESTION:

He talked-about work areas.

MR. COME:

Well, he defined a work area as an

area where a patient received care or treatment.
QUESTION:

You are not suggesting that the cor-

riuors 01” the hospital are not associated with patient care?
MR. COME:

If it —

QUESTION:

Are you?

MR. COME:

No, I’m not, but we do not have the

corridors of the hospital Involved in this case.

We have

here the cafeteria, two lobbies and the gift shop and the
parking lot and the entrances which except for the emergency
room were conceded by the hospital administrator not to be
patient care areas.
QUESTION:

Does the Board apply Its rule to the

9
hospital corridors?
MR. COME:

The Court of Appeals in the Baylor

Hospital found that it had and the Board was reversed on
that because it was on the ground that the hospital had
shown enough facts to indicate that those hospitals -that those corridors were associated with patient care.
We do not have that in this case.
QUESTION:

Does the Board apply its rules to

nurse’s stations?
MR. COME:

The hospital in this case permitted

solicitation in the —
QUESTION:
why?.

I am'going to ask your opposition

But does the Board apply its rules to nurse’ s stations9
MR. COME:

I think It would depend upon whether

or not you could -- the hospital could show that those were
patient care areas, and I think in most hospitals It would
be easy to show that.

What you have here is just a blanket

rule that bars solicitation in any, in every public
of the hospital.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the Board’s attitude

/

about nurse’s' stations, if any?
MR. COME:

I think that it would depend upon

whether it could be shown that that was a work area or a
patient care area.

That has not been litigated, to my

^knowledge, in any of these cases so far.

I have no doubt

10

that it will be as we get into these cases more fully.
QUESTION:

I take it, in the constant care area,

which Is becoming more and more popular, probably the
Board idll be fairly lenient there?
MR. COME:

I would think so.

QUESTION:

Mr. Come,

Is the Board still applying

Its rule to corridors in any hospitals after the reversal
in the Baylor cdse or will It try it out in some other
circuits, or do you know?
MR. COME:

I do not know, Your Honor. What the

Board has done is to take back some of the other hospital
cases and —

_

.. . ---

—*-*

QUESTION:

How about'the general counsel?

MR. COME:

What's that?

QUESTION:

What about the general counsel?

MR. COME:

I know of no specific case involving

the corridors.
QUESTION:

Mr. Come, doesn't this case — I

know you said it doesn't, but doesn't this ease involve
the corridor at least to this extent, even though the
solicitation was hot in the corridor, the Board’s order,
if one reads it one way, does prohibit solicitation in
the corridor, If one reads It another way, it doesn't.
.And I read it frankly to prohibit solicitation In the
corridor because I thought the Board didn't treat corridors

11
as patient care areas.

I think that is what Mr. Justice

Powell is asking you, too.
MR. COME:

Well, I think what the Board Order

says is that the hospital just cannot have a blanket ban
in these public areas.

What they have to do is to define

with more precision what are their patient care areas and
even with respect to non-patient care areas, xtfhat are
areas where it is likely that this sort of activity would
interfere with patient care.

They have not done any of

that in this case.
QUESTION:

There is very substantial testimony

in this case, Mr. Come, about the corridors and the use to
which they were put.
MR. COME:

Well, 1 would rike to get to that

testimony, but I will -'QUESTION:
happened to it?

In light of that testimony, what

You say it is out of the case.

MR. COME:

No, that testimony in short merely

Indicated that -- it was given after the rule was promul­
gated, it was essential to keep a tranquil atmosphere
throughout the hospital.

When the doctors were asked

about union solicitation, as my brother, Mr. Gold, will
indicate In more detail, they indicated that what they
were concerned about was loud or hostile or volatile union
solicitation and that peaceful solicitation, one on one,

12
they did not think would affect patient care.
QUESTION:

One on one when a patient may need

the attention of the nurse, for example, one on one
solicitation at a time when patients are ringing for
nurses or orderlies?
MR. COME:

Well, this is not in a patient care

area, it is not — it when the employees are off duty.
QUESTION:

To get back to your statement about

these corridors not being used for treatment, I think the
record shows that the first thing doctors now try to do
following surgery is to get that patient out into the
corridors and into the rooms, the sitting rooms, waiting
rooms where they can visit with families and friends, and
then they move up and down, if the record clearly shows,
in wheelchairs, on stretchers to and from treatment rooms,
and nobody can tell in advance when a patient will be so
postured.
But coming back to the original point, I would
like to know whether corridors are in this case or out of
it.

I thought they were in it.
MR. COME:

I think that they are in unless the

hospital is able to demonstrate that they are patient care
areas or that activity there would interfere with patient
care.

They are—
QUESTION:

Must they demonstrate both, that they

13

were patient care areas and that activities —•
MR. COME:

No, either.

QUESTION:

Didn't this Court earlier this term

in Baylor University Hospital differentiate between the
cafeteria and the corridors in its disposition of the
case summarily?
MR. COME:

They did because they found that the

hospital there had introduced evidence, which showed that
the corridors were not -— were patient care areas.

There

was enough evidence put in there to show that the
corridors were ~~
QUESTION:

What has happened to that case?

MR. COME:

Baylor Hospital.

QUESTION:

What has happened to it?

It was

remanded to the Court of Appeals.
MR. COME:

Well, only the cafeteria was remanded

to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals in turn
remanded the cafeteria issue back to the Board.
QUESTION:

But the corridor —-

MR. COME

The corridor issue —

QUESTION

•— we denied certiorari?

MR. COME

Yes, you did. Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And It was held in that case by the

Court of Appeals, they refused to enforce the Board’s
order with respect to the corridors, is that It?

MR. COME:

Right, but the reason for denying

cert was that the Court viewed it as a substantial evidence
question in that ease.
QUESTION:

You are telling us that is why we

denied cert?
MR. COME:

That is what the opinion of the Court

said.
I would like to save the balance of my time for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Gold.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE INTERVENOR-PETITIONER
MR. GOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

\
To continue with the point that Mr. Come was

discussing, it is our understanding that under the Board’s
•

present approach,, the firstinquiry
area is animmediatepatient

V

is whether aparticular

carearea

or not.There

are

factual and legal problems in making that determination,
just as there are in making any other determination, and
•

'

i

the Board has not yet articulated its appros.ch to solving
all of the questions and arriving at the lines of de­
marcation.

As an appendix to our brief, the blue brief,

we print our7 submission to the Board on a series of cases

15
which have corae back to the Board after Beth Israel, where
we discuss an approach to the different rules that could
be applied,at page 40 through 42, that could be applied in
the different functional areas of the hospital, if that is
the Board's view as to the proper approach.
At any rate, corridors are in the case, this ease,
but they are treated under the Board’s order only by a
distinction between patient care and non-patient care areas
and that has to be made more concrete, depending on what
happens in this Court in handling the basic question of
whether the overall Board approach is right or at least
right with regard to areas other than cafeterias.
I would like to spend the remainder of ray time
making three basic points.

The first is that the overall

presumption here seems to us to be a common sense way of
developing the law.
Act.

It rests on two basic premises of the

One is that stated by this Court in the Magnavox

ease, 415 U.S., that the working place or at least non- ■
%

working areas of the working place are uniquely appropriate
for employee communication, that they are presumptively
saved to the employees for distribution and solicitation.
And secondly, a point made in numerous labor law oases,
more specifically I would think in the Allen case, 373 U.S.,
that the party with the facts and the knowledge is the one
who ought to have the burden of proof of demonstrating

16
its position.

And here, of course, the hospital position

is that patient care would suffer at least in certain
regards if solicitation and distribution is allowed.

The

hospital claims to have the expertise with regard to these
medical questions, and it is appropriate it seems to us to
put the burden on the hospital.

This is a rebuttable

presumption, this is not a rule of law that we are discussing here.

The Board’s position is that a broad ban on

employee discussion is presumptive!?; unlawful and the
hospital can —
QUESTION:

These cases you refer to are not

hospital cases, are they?
MR. GOLD:

No.

No.

'

QUESTION:

Don’t you think there is quite a

difference between a factory or something of that kind and
a hospital or a hotel?

Do you sup;gest that the appropriate

solicitations take place in the lobby of a hotel?
MR. GOLD:

It would seem to me that there would

be occasions where it might.
QUESTION:

To visit the bellboys when they are

there to take care of the customers?
MR. GOLD:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the

best way I can answer that question is to turn to A-66 .of
the record.

At that point, Mr. French, who did the

soliciting here for the union, stated what solicitation

17
was, and. we are talking about an abstraction here, and I
think it helps to make it more concrete.

He said he

solicited in the cafeteria, and he said I asked if I could
join people, other employees who were sitting down taking
a break and eating, and sat down and talked xvith them.
That is- what solicitation is.

It is not something that is

unusual for people to do on their breaks.

People, whether

they are bellboys, whether they are hospital personnel —
QUESTION:

You will get into the cafeteria?

You

are talking about the public areas of a hospital that
would correspond somewhat to the public areas of a hotel.
MR. GOLD:

Well, I --

QUESTION:

And they can then just solicit with­

out any interference with the working functions?
MR. GOLD:

T think it would depend on whether It

was a non-working area xoxf tniem and wiiecher they were on
non-working time.

The reason I responded as I did was that

it depends I would think on what they do.

If you have two

bellboys, to use your example, who are taking a break which
is permitted to them In the corner of a hospital, and one
says to the other, "We don't have a union here, it would
be good if we had one," and they had a quiet conversation
\

and the person to whom that subject is broached says, "That
is a good idea" or "a bad idea," I don't see what employer
interest, what hospital interest, what hotel interest

18
ought to say that that Is Inappropriate.
On the other hand, if they are standing at the
front desk holding a customer's suitcase and having that
conversation ifith a customer standing there when they are
on working time, that is a very different case.

So all 1

was trying to say is that solicitation is the task
normally of discussing, and if it happens in an area where
such discussions are common, where there is conversation,
people walking around, conversing on many different sub­
jects, it is difficult for us to see why off-duty employees
in a non-working area should not be permitted to engage in
that activity.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, you restrict It to the non­

working area and non-working time?
MR. GOLD:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Both?

MR. GOLD:

Right.

In the non-hospital context,

at least the factory context may be a better word, solici­
tation has been permitted in working areas during non­
working time but not distribution.

That Is a rule that I

doubt the Board would follow in areas where the public is
present.

And the reason that I have taken your time to

stress the point I've made Is that the medical testimony, in
this case seems to us to suffer from a basic defect.
that the doctors didn't know what solicitation was.

It is
Ap;ain,

19
I would like to direct you to page 61 of the record, Dr.
Rickson, after testifying for a length of time that is
reflected in pages 51 through 60 of the record, is crossexamined and the question is, union solicitation, do you
know what effect it would have.

Answer:

First, may I ask

the question to be sure you and I understand what is union
solicitation, what does it consist of.
The medical testimony here by and large assumes
that union solicitation involves turmoil, confusion, loud
noises, speeches and so on.

We think, no matter xirhat the

basic legal rule is, that whether there is a presumption
for or against solicitation, the ultimate question ought
to be that whatever the ultimate basic point ought to be,
that whatever standard the employer adopts , if it bears
more heavily on union solicitation of the kind that I have
indicated goes on in this case

than on cognate non-union

activities, discussion of other Issues which may have just
as great an effect on somebody, may be just as likely to
result in an argument.

My working experience is that the

most likely areas for argument are questions of who is
going to win'-the Wor Id Series and foreign policy, and so on.
If you have general discussion, union discussion
i

ought to be permitted.
QUESTION:

That is the basic point we see.

Mr. Gold, you refer to testimony on

pages 60 and 61, but if you keep reading — I don't suggest

20
you do it now, you may take my word for it, and if I am
wrong then you can speak — at the top of page 62, the
same doctor, xvhen asked about the effect on oatients, he
said there doesn’t have to be a fight or argument or
heated discussion if the patients get the idea that
people who are supposed to be taking care of them have
their mind on something else, they are not very happy
about it.
MR. GOLD:

Yes.

May I respond to that, Mr.

QUESTION:

Of course.

QUESTION:

If he is willing to give you his

MR. GOLD:

If I had time, I had planned to go

Justice?

time.

on to that.

But the reason that we think the Board could

disregard that testimony is the reason I concluded with.
Certainly if the hospital goes to the point of saying
that employees in the cafeteria, employees on breaks,
wherever members of the public may be, can’t talk to each
other about anything, then perhaps that rationale makes
some sense.

But that isn’t the way this hospital works.

This is just like Beth Israel, where they tell the people
who work at the hospital that if they discuss patient
care, they should be careful not to be overheard.

There

isn't a scintilla of evidence here that anybody censors

21
employee conversations on any issue other than union
Issues, and we think that that is the first point.

That

testimony is testimony that has nothing to do with the
real world.

The hospital permits TV, it permits radio,

patients talk to each other, visitors talk to each other.
QUESTION:

You have covered those points before.

MR. GOLD:

That is the test.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Elarbee.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED W. ELARBEE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ELARBEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
With the Court’s indulgence, I would like to
visit with the Court for a moment before I start my argu­
ment, and particularly with Justice Stewart.

Some 24

years ago, in 19155, I argued my very first case in the
/

Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.

At that time, I was repre­

senting the Iron Workers International Union.
time I have gone to the other side.

Since that

I want to say that

Justice Stewart was on that panel, and It is a pleasure to
see you again, Justice Stewart.

I might say in passing

that I hope I have better luck here today than 1 had that
day 24 years ago.
(Laughter)
QUESTION:

Well, it is a fact that you are

22
familiar with both sides of the problem.
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

I hope so.

As you see5 I am a defector, too.

I

am not longer on that court.
MR. ELARBEE:

I think, if the Court please, what

we have here is an attempt by the Board to establish a rule
that arises out of an industrial setting to a hospital
situation which simply does not fit.

It is quite one thing

when you talk about a manufacturing plant where all the
employees are involved, and another when you talk about a
situation where third parties' rights and Interests are
Involved.
Of course, the Board got into that in the retail
store cases.

But here you have even a further more direct

and important interest involved, It seems to me, and that
is the right of the patient or what the patient eon expect
when he goes to the hospital, sometimes quite 111, and what
the patient's attitude is with respect to what is happening
to him and those around him in the hospital.
So I think the Board, in establishing a rule
that simply says immediate patient care area and sneaks of
such areas such as the operating room, the patient's room,
and perhaps the x-ray room, is making a far too limited
rule, given a modern day hospital when, as this record
shows, as in Baptist Hospital, patients are likely to be

23

all over the hospital, patients who are ambulatory, patients
who are transported to different places in the hospital.
The rule simply doesnft fit in ligth of the testimony in
this record.
In Beth Israel, Justice Blackmun expressed this
concern in his concurring opinion:

”1 fear that this

unusual case will be deemed to be an example for all
hospital eating facility cases, and that the Board or
the courts now will go further down the ooen solicitation
road than they would have done had a more usual hospital
case been the first one to come here.”
Justice Brennan, in writing the majority opinion,
admonished the Board to follow the cases, the hospital
cases as they came before them, not to take Beth Israel
as a standard that necessarily was to be applied in all
cases.
And I think what we have Is the Board taking
its rule as enunciated in St. John’s Hospital and which
formed the foundation for Beth Israel, which this Court
decided earlier on a completely and vastly different
record, it is taking Its rule in St. John's and has
applied it again in this case without even a discussion
of the record evidence in its decision.

It did It on. the

basis of a footnote, we are following St. John's In the
footnote.

24

So what we have, first of all, it seems to me,
is a Board establishing a rule that rises primarily out of
an industrial situation, a raanuf acturinp; plant, attempting
•9

to transpose it with some minor modification to a hospital
with immediate patient care areas, and it simply will not
fit in a hospital such as Baptist.
First of all, I would like to point out that
there were substantial differences in the record evidence
in this case that was presented to this Court in the Beth
Israel Hospital case.

Justice Blackmun anticipated, as

did .Justice Powell in his concurring opinion, anticipated
that this might very well arise.
Some of the thinp^s that are substantially differ­
ent, it seems to me, is that there is a much greater showing
in this case that there was public use by visitors and
relatives in the Baptist Hospital cafeteria, and I suppose
along with that, non-employees or perhaps patients, it
doesn’t show, but it does show that about 32 percent of the
patrons in the cafeteria during weekdays were visitors or
were non-employees.
visitors, I suppose.

It could have been patients and
About 53 percent or a majority on
i

the weekends were non-employees in the cafeteria.
And the medical testimony, the unrefuted, uncon­
tradicted testimony was that if there is anything unsettling
that occurs or circumstances that occur to a relative of

25
the patient, it invariably rubs off on the patient and
could certainly affect the recovery or the progress of the
patient with respect to the treatment he was receiving at
the hospital.
So you have contrasted, as one of the members of
the Court said, I believe, in Beth Israel, what seems to
be a typically employee oriented cafeteria.

That is not

the record in Baptist Hospita, when certainly on weekends
a majority, at least according to the survey that was done,
it was a limited survey according to the record, shows that
a majority of the people visiting the cafeteria over the
weekend were non-employees or visitors to the hospital.
One point I would like to make further, and if
you read this record, all through it, the medical experts,
the doctors treated the hospital as a whole, as a patient
care area, those areas of the hospital where the patients
were likely to be found.

They did not distinguish between

the operating room or the patient?s room or the'gift shop
where patients visit to get a newspaper or perhaps cigarettes
or some other reason.

Those doctors did not distinguish

between these areas and the immediate patient care areas,
as the Board has done.
Another thing that was so vasly different about
Beth Israel and is not true In this case is the record
evidence in that case showed that the hospital itself,

26
apparently because only about 9 percent of the visitors to
that cafeteria* 9 percent of them were visitors, had used
it for —• had allowed individual, one on one solicitation
prior to this case arising, It had used it for other types
of solicitations, for charities, various types of chari­
ties, it had established a table and display rack for
brochures and other employee information.

That is not true

in Baptist Hospital.
This record shows that this rule had been in
force for many years.
in the cafeteria.

They had not allowed solicitation

It even shows that Mr. Victory — I

believe it was his testimony — that one employee attempted
to sell Avon products in the cafeteria, was disallowed.,
prior, long before this case arose.

There has been a

consistent rule, consistently applied.
QUESTION:

I think —

Could an employee make an appointment

with his insurance broker to meet him in the cafeteria to
see if he needs more insurance, or not?
MR. ELARBEE:

No, sir, not if they are going to

apply the rule as they say they do.
solicitation is forbidden there.

They say that

If they made it, they

couldn't do that.
QUESTION:

What about a sitting room, a place

where — the only place probably where a patient could
talk to somebody outside.

I suppose you could make an

27

appointment with your brother to visit with him and the
next half hour you say you couldn't be chatting with your
insurance agent?
MR. ELARBEE:

According to the rule, Mr. Justice,

the solicitation or selling, things of that sort are not
permitted in the public access areas.

1 think the hospital

demonstrated in this record With the testimony of the
doctors that they had good reason for that.

I suppose a

patient might get away with something like that, but cer­
tainly it is not permitted under the rules.
QUESTION:

If the patient wants to see his in­

surance agent, he can invite him to his room and see him in
his room.
MR. ELARBEE:

He could invite him to his room

and I suppose that might be all right if only the patient
and the insurance salesman was there.

But certainly they

would not —
QUESTION:

I suppose if he is in a ward a

fortiori he couldn't invite him in there.
MR. ELARBEE:

No, sir, although people are per­

mitted I think from time to time to visit wards, but I
don’t think they want anybody selling anybody anything in
a hospital room.
QUESTION:

Let’s get closer to home.

lawyer go in and see his client?

Can a

28
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And write a will?

MR. ELARBEE:

I suppose he could talk to him

about important matters such as a will, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

I am trying to get closer to home.

MR. ELARBEE:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I would like

to get to a point here which I think nay be somewhat mis­
leading,

There is no need for this Court or for any of us

to assume that union solicitation

, ist another type of

ordinary conversation carried on between two people in a
quiet and unassuming manner.

This Court long ago recognized

in one of the early free speech cases, and I think the
language was something like the language of the picket line
is not the parlance of the parlor.

I don't know if it was

-- it was one of the old free speech cases a long time ago.
Well, certainly this is not a picket line, but the Board
has Itself recognized that union solicitation can be un­
settling.

It said it in St. John's, it said admittedly

that union solicitation would be unsettling, but they said
in

Immediate patient care areas.
Now, how can you —QUESTION:

Do you suppose it makes any difference

if it is 30 percent — 10 percent patients in the cafeteria
or 60 percent?
MR. ELARBEE:

No, sir, I don’t.

I don’t think —

29
QUESTION:

So you would sugp^est that we were

wrong in Beth Israel?
MR. ELARBEE:

Well, I could go along with you a

little bit on that, but —
QUESTION:

Not very far though on this argument,

could you?
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

Pardon, sir?

You couldn’t go very far with us on

Beth Israel, making this argument you are making now?
MR. ELARBEE:

No, sir, I really couldn’t.

I say

that the facts are completely distinguishable, however,
from what occurred in Beth Israel.

Now, I.think that the

question you raise is also applicable to the Board’s stand­
ard of immediate patient care area.

If something is un­

settling, certainly it can be unsettling in the gift shop,
in the cafeteria, in the corridor, as well as: in the
patient’s room, for Instance.
that kind of a line.
QUESTION:

I don't see how you can draw

First of all —
Can’t you draw a line between the

operating room and the parking lot?
MR. ELARBEE:

Yes, sir, and the court below did,

too.
QUESTION:

I mean do you?

MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

You don’t have any patients out in

30
the parking lot very often, do you?
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Are you goinp; to mention the nurse’s

station situation In the Baptist Hospital case?
MR. ELARBEE:

Yes, sir.

According to the record,

this hospital allows people during non-work time, employees
in the nursing stations to carry on solicitation at those
locations.

The record shows that It has occurred in those

locations, and the hospital has not done anything about it
or has not reprimanded employees for it.
Now, beyond that, where do you want me to go?
QUESTION:

Well, I just wondered if you thought

that was consistent with your position as to the cafeteria
and other places.
MR. ELARBEE:

Yes, sir.

The record shows that

employees take breaks in the nurse’s stations.

It also

shows that the nurse's stations are rather large areas,
they are I believe 20 by 40 feet, and I am sure most of us
have been in a hospital and seen people sitting in a
nurse's station drinking a Coca-Cola, drinking coffee and
not at work.
QUESTION:

Not I.

Not I in the hospitals I know

of.
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

Well, I can’t —

I must confess, what is a nurse's

31
station?
MR. ELARBEE:

At least the record — pardon me,

sir.
QUESTION:

Is the nurse’s station the area in

which the nurses relax when they are not working, or is it
like the desk clerk in a hotel, where she is giving orders
and so forth, which is —»
MR. ELARBEE:

Primarily, as I understand it, sir,

a work area but according to the evidence in this record
at this hospital, it is used for employees for breaks also,
and the utility rooms next-door.

That is unrefuted in the

testimony.
QUESTION:

The patients don’t use it, do they?

MR. ELARBEE:

No, sir.

It is a work area

separated from the patients and the public by glass
petitions, according to the record in this case.

The

question was asked, well, why would the hospital permit
it.

The only reason that I could assume is that It is a

rather large area, they do take breaks in the area, and if
they are not at work then I suppose the hospital says that
the public or the patients are not involved —
QUESTION:

At least it hasn't anything to do with

this case or the rationale of this case because there aren’t
any patients involved.
MR. ELARBEE:

That’s right, sir, only to this

32
extents that this Court considered the fact that in Beth
Israel, and it has been considered in many other cases,
there were not places or sufficient places for people to
communicate with respect to section 7 rights and things of
this sort.

But in this ease, the record shows that there

are 26 nursing stations, 28 utility rooms that have
coffee machines in some of them and are used for break
areas, employee lounges, I believe two with vending
machines, the laundry building, maintenance building,
employee rest roans and the parking lot which are avail­
able for solicitation in this case.

So It is an entirely

different record from what we had in Baptist Hospital.
QUESTION:

Do you mean in Beth Israel?

MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

Beth Israel, I'm sorry.

Is there a rule against employees

talking with each other about whether or not to join a
union,just to get a^■/ay from this word "solicitation"?
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

Solicitation?

Yes.

Can the employees talk about

and get into an argument about -- neither of them is a
solicitor for a union but they are just arguing pro and
con union.

Are they supposed to do that in the restaurant

or not?
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

Your Honor,

I would say not.

You would say not,

does the rule

33
forbid that?
MR. ELARBEE:
not been brought up.
QUESTION:

That particular set of facts have
I can't answer you —

Can they get in a big argument In the

cafeteria about whether there ought to be a united front
or separate fund drives for Red Cross?
MR. ELARBEE:

Your Honor, I view a discussion

between two people as a little bit different from the way
I view solicitation as such.

Solicitation involves an in­

dividual going from one person to another soliciting them
to take some action, in this case with respect to the union.
But the record is clear, and the doctors do not distinguish
between union solicitation or any other form of solicitation
or conduct which would simply be non-professional in their
view.
I would distinguish, if two people were sitting
having a conversation,but in terms of distributing union
cards, in terms of going around soliciting people to join
up, let's go to the meeting tomorrow night, which could
precipitate —
QUESTION:

An employee couldn't circulate a pe­

tition in an election, not a union election but couldn't
get signatures to put somebody on a ballot to run for city
council?
MR. ELARBEE:

Not in those areas accessible to

the public in the hospital, sir.

There are other areas

which would be available for that purpose, but not in those
areas that are aecesible to the nubile.
QUESTION:

Which ones do you mean, the locker

room and the parking lot?
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

No, sir, the nurse’s -—

Which ones?

MR. ELARBEE:

The nurse’s stations, the utility

rooms, the two employee lounges.

One is a cafeteriea type

lounge, they have vending machines, and seats approximately
fifty people; another one seats 25 to 30.

Apparently in the

entire maintenance building, at least that is the testimony,
in the laundry building, is also the testimony, employee
rest rooms and the parking lot.

Now, there are some fifty-

odd locations where these activities can take place that
are not accessible to the public.
QUESTION:

The laundry, can you hear anything in

the laundry?
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

The laundry building is what the —

Can you hear anything —■ have you ever

been in one?
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I have.

Have you been able to hear anything

other than the machines, the laundry room machines?
MR. ELARBEE:

1 recognize that it is not the ideal

35
place.

But then again ~~ and I think this is an important

point to this Court — we are not here, I don’t think the
union is entitled to say we are entitled to jdeal circum­
stances to carry on our activities.
QUESTION:

That would be a good place for a

heated discussion, I suppose.
MR. ELARBEE:
be an accommodation.

That's right.

I mean, there must

After all, we are talking about a

hospital, we are talking about patients, and if you had a
sick one in a hospital, I am sure you realize that if they
are truly sick, if they just overhear two nurses talking
about whether or not they are going to go to the beach the
next day is irritating and upsetting to a person who is
sitting and wondering if they are going to live or die or
if something is seriously wrong with them.
QUESTION:

But there are some people who have

been in the hospital and heard nurses talking about whether
they are going to get their promotion, which had nothing
*

to do with the union, but that is all right.
MR. ELARBEE:

Well, I think the testimony of the

* ■

doctors was that any type of conduct, of conversation which
was unprofessional or would show the patient or the patient
might be led to believe that these people are more concerned
with something other than patient care or me would be up­
setting to the patient and they did net distinguish, Justice

36
Marshall, between a patient's family or the patient.
QUESTION:

What I am worried about is if they

d.ecide is what is good conversation and what is not, and I
think some people don't like other people deciding what
they should talk about.
MR. ELARBEE:
QUESTION:

I suppose they could —

Isn't that right?

MR. ELARBEE:

Well, yes and no.

I suppose we

could speculate here what kind of conversations would be
permitted, with ordinary, average conversation between two
people
QUESTION:

I wouldn't want to get involved ir

that.
MR. ELARBEE:

All right.

What we are talking

about is the right to solicit union membership on the
premises, and the Board recognizes the unsettling effects
of union solicitation.

It says that in St. John's.

Given

that, how can you say that if you are only limited to the
operating room or the patient's room?

I think that the

Board is either saying one of two things:

They are either

saying that it would not have unsettling effects in other
places, it is eit/her saying that or it is saying it will
only upset a few and therefore we should allow It.

I don't

think that is an acceptable standard.
I believe I have basically covered the points for

37
the Court.

I urge the Court again that the court below

reviewed the record and found that insofar as the Board
had concluded that the hospital here showed special cir­
cumstances, that the Board limited those special circum­
stances to the immediate patient care area, the court
below specifically found that is not the evidence in this
record and said, there was no justification for the Board
concluding in the facts of this case that it should be
limited to "immediate patient care area," and I ask this
Court to affirm the decision of the court below which I
believe to be correct.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 3:16 o'clock p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
