MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will bear arguments

next in 77-832, Board of Governors of the Federal Reservo
System versus First Lincolmrocd Corporation»
Mr. Shapiro, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN EL SHAPIRO, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHAPIRO;

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

the court;
This ease is here an the Federal Reserve Board’s
petition for certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit,

The Seventh Circuit set aside an

order of the Board which it denied respondent permission to
become a bard: holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956.
This case presents the question whether the Board
may deny a bank holding company application where the proposed
bark’s subsidiary is undercapitalised and where the proposed
holding company would be so encumbered by debt that the bank
would remain undercapitalised for a period of at least twelve
years.
QUESTION s

Do you moan by that — the question is

whether they have the authority to do it or whether they have
the discretion to do it?
MR, SHAPIROs

Whether they have the statutory

4
authority to deny the application,

tod we are her© today to

contend that the Board may indeed deny such an application unless
and until the capital deficiency is remedied.
Respondent is an Illinois corporation.
QUESTIONS

Do I correctly understand that the under­

capitalisation ie conceded hare?
Mft- SHSPIROs

That is correct.

In Respondent's brief

the point is made that the capital ratios were low.

That is

recognised in the Seventh Circuit opinion end indeed it is
recognised in all of the other submission© from the Comptroller
and from tbs Federal Reserve Bank and from the Board's staff.
Respondent is an Illinois corporation which planned
to acquire 80 percent of the voting stock of the First National
Bank of Lincolnwood.

It stated in its application that it

would assume not only the stock but also a debt in the sum of
$3,700,000.

Respondent also planned to cause the bank to

issue an additional $1 million in debt securities after formation c
the holding company and an additional $1 million in equity after
the holding company was-formed.
The application was initially reviewed by the Chicago
Federal Reserve Bank,,

The Reserve' Bank recommended approval

of the application despite its recognition that the capital
level in the bank was below the Board's current guidelines and
would remain below the guidelines during the 12-year period
needed to retire the debt.

5
The Reserve Bank believed, however, that the com­
petence of management and possible improved earnings were
positive factors which outweighed the low capitalisation factor.
And in a brief: letter the Comptroller of the Currency joined
in that affirmative recommendation.
When the application was received by the Board- in
Washington, it was reviewed initially by the Board’s Division
of Research and Statistics and than again by its Division of
Banking Regulation and Supervision, both of which recommended
denial„

They pointed out again that the Bank was seriously

undercapitalised at present.

The ratio of capital to assets4"’

was five percent, when it should have been at least eight
percent.
That meant that the bank needed an additional $2-1/2
million in equity capital to meet the Board's minimum standards,
QUESTIONS

Well denying the application was not going

to give it that additional capital though, was it?
MR. SHAPIROs

That is quite correct, but the insistent

in this category of cases that capital be replenished as a
prerequisite to getting the desired change in status is the
motivation that makes applicants com® up with the additional
equity capital.
QUESTION?

In other words, the Board kind of has

a red light and says unless the Bank meets particular qualifi­
cations which we would not independently enforce of your holding

company application, we will deny leave for formation of the
holding company?
MR. SHAPIROs

The light is red until the Board examines

the financial resources of the parent and the subsidiary and
it has to find that each is adequate under the Board‘s current
standards.

And in this case it found a serious deficiency in

the bank and it found that the holding company by extracting
dividends from the bank would keep the bank in that under­
capitalised state for a period of at least 12 years.
QUESTIONS

Well, would not dividends be extracted by

the present owners if there is no holding company?
MR. SHAPIRO3
QUESTION s

That is correct.

That is quite true.

So what good does it do to deny the

application?
MR. SHAPIROs

By insisting on replenishing capital

in this kind of case where there is a serious deficiency, the
Board has obtained an injection of badly needed capital in
some 400 separate cases and an injection of some $2 billion
in badly needed equity in the banking system.

That is the good

that is done and that is what is at stake with this application
approval power.
The power has been used effectively and successfully
to augment the capital bass in the nation's banks.
QUESTIONS

The Beard just charges a price, in other

words, for somebody who wants to form a simple bank holding

price by improving the capitalisation of the beak.

Is that correct?

That is correct,

Sven though the capitalisation of the

bank would be unchanged absent Board action, whether or not
it was owned as before by individual owners or owned thereafter
by a holding company?

That is precisely the point.

And this

procedure is identical to the procedure under the Federal
Reserve Act which Congress stated was the model, to be applied

Reserve System, it does not matter whether the change in status

will.

It hardly ever

It is inconceivable that it would.
Tha question though in this context is whether

minimal standards are met, and if they are not mat, the
applicant is told to go back and improve the situation and coma
back at a later date for Board approval.

And that is the

approach that has been applied consistently under the Holding
Company Act.
QUESTION %

Mr. Shapiro, having interrupted you, may

I ask you this which doss not seem to be very clear from my

reading of the briefs at least
Do the individual owners — if this should become
a holding company» do the individual owners remain guarantors
of the debt?
ME. SHAPIRO %

Yes, they are.

They are indeed

guarantors, secondarily liable.
QUESTIONS

Sc if that is true, the situation remains

as before from the point of view of the stability of that
indebtedness and any advantage of the holding company, however
slight, is a net advantage, is it not?
MR. SHAPIROs

That is correct.

The situation remains

in the state of serious undercapitalization.

QUESTION?

Mr. Shapiro, if I understand you correctly,

if the holding company war® a multi-mi11ion dollar concern,
just all cash and no risk business in it and no multiple bank
situation, you would nevertheless — and if the results of the
formation of the holding company would be totally to the benefit
of the bank because they would get the tax desducfcion they do
not now get, you would nevertheless disapprove the application
unless they poured additional capital into the bank?
MR. SHAPIROs

That is correct.

Until the S percent

standard has been satisfied, the subsidiary's condition is
seriously deficient and that has to be remedied as a prerequisite
to approval.

That is quite correct.

QUESTIONS

Is there not some value to the guarantees

resulting from a Holding Company Act —- from the holding company
status?
MR. SHAPIROs

There certainly is very significant

advantage in having the holding company status.

The holding

company for one thing is in a position to issue —
QUESTIONS

Advantage to whom?

MR. SHAPIROs

— debt securities without restrictions

under Regulation Q that apply to individual banks.

With the

holding company base additional business activities can be
entered into.

There are numerous benefits in addition to the

tax advantage.
QUESTIONS

A branch bank or almost

10
MR. SHAPIRO §

Not in Illinois.

Illinois has limits

on branch banking, one facility within 1,500 yards, a second
facility within two miles and that is it, but in many states,
of course, where there are limits on brandling, you can get
around those limits by setting up a holding company with multibank subsidiaries.
Slow Oklahoma and Testas ara clear examples of that
situationi
QUESTIONS

But if your answer is accurate that the

original owners here remain as guarantors of indebtedness, than
there is the advantage of now there being two sets of debtors
instead of just one.
MR. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION s

Well, the holding company —

The holding company is now added as an

additional debtor and the original debtors remain debtors,
correct?
MR. SHAPIROs

The holding company under this applica­

tion would remain simply a shell»

It would have no additional

working —
QUESTION:

It assumes the indebtedness though, does

it not?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct.

It assumes the

indebtedness.
QUESTION:

So it is an additional debtor?

MR. SHAPIRO:

And it would have no income other than

IX
the dividends paid from the bank which would otherwise be paid
to those guarantors which you referred to.
QUESTION s

it would otherwise foe paid to Uncle Sam?

The dividends for the most part you are talking about s.re the
product of the tax saving?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct.

In the first year the

saving would b© roughly $130,000 diminishing every year down
to
QUESTIONS

The government’s position is it is better

to have that money go to the government really?
MR. SHAPIROs

The government’s position is that if

this new valuable status is sought, it is incumbent upon the
party seeking this new advantage to shoulder the responsibility
of maintaining adequate capital in the bank.

That is the

government's position in a nutshell.
QUESTIONs

And your position is based entirely on

the statutory language that the Board shall take into conslaer&~
tien the financial and managerial resources in future prospects
of the company or companies in the bank's concern?
MR. SHAPIRO:

And it is based on the long history

that we cite in the brief.

One pertinent portion of that is

the analysis — or the analogy to the practice und?r the Federal
Reserve Act where an applicant cannot obtain membership in the
system unless its capital is adequate relative to assets and
relative to liabilities —

12
QUESTION:

Well there, of course, you are talking

about membership in a system of banks,all of which affect on©
another in their operation.

You do not have any consideration

like that here, do you?
MR. SHAPIROs

There are certainly economic differences,

but Congress said that they are inconsequential and that the
same pattern is applicable under the Holding Company Act.
QUESTIONS

Does the government still concede as it

did — at least Judge Fairchild quoted you in the Court of
Appeals as saying that in any economic analysis of this, the
formation of a new company can only be beneficial to the bank,
cannot cause any harm.
MR• SHAPIRO:

I think that concession has been strained

a bit but we do agree that a $130,000 benefit is better than
no $130,000 benefit and that is a positive factor.
QUESTION;

And you cannot point to any ham other

than the failure to do something you want them to do?
MR. SHAPIRO;

We can point to possible harm and the

Board did that in its opinion.

It pointed out that there could

be- a weakening of the bank's financial condition.

And what it

meant by that was what the staff had indicated in its projections
of the condition of the bank for a 12-year period.
Capital ratios could decline slightly to 4.8 percent,
starting at 5.2 percent, but that was based on a number of
assumptions and it was caused, by a number of factors.

13
QUESTION?

All of which would have applied if there

had been no bank holding company involved?

applied.

Wall, soma of which would not have

The issuance of $1 milion in debt securities was a

new step and that gives rise to new debt service requirements
of $100,000 every year.

That was a new element.

But we do not say if there is any assurance that this

possibility.

It is a

And there are other possible dangers that result

from the affiliation of a bank and a leverage holding company,
fha...Beverly BfIXn National Bank case is a good example.

In

that case the holding company issued commercial paper, short-term
debt securities and it was unable to meet its obligations on
that commercial paper, only $2 million in debt and that caused
a run on the bonk even though
QUESTIONs

the bank was sold.

Yes, but that was a situation in which

they did not maintain the 80 percent necessary to take advantage
of the tax advantage which is the whole purpose of this
transaction.
MR. SHAPIROs

Well, 1 have never seen that fact

referred, Your Honor, that there was less than 80 percent
control la the Beverly Hills National Bank case.

I believe

that there was 80 percent control.
The difficulty was that the holding company could
not meet a relatively small obligation on its debt securities

14
And even though the hank was sound, this caused a panic among
depositors? $30 million in deposits ware withdrawn in three
days.

This is a possible difficulty that results from the

combination of a highly leverage holding company with large
amounts of debt outstanding and the possibility of not being
able to meet its obligations.
This is a danger imposed on the bank that would not
otherwise exist.

VSe ara not saying that that will happen.

The

Board mad© no finding that it necessarily would result, but that
is the sort, of danger that the Board takes into account when it
talks about possible weakening which it referred to in its
opinion.
QUESTION:

What criteria do you suggest were taken

into account by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in recommending
approval of this computation?
MR. SHAPIROs

The Reserve Bank in Chicago recognised

the low capitalisation problem and recognised Its persistence,
but it fait that there was a strong management in this bank
and that the management had done a lot good for the bank which
we do not dispute.

And that this management should not be

faulted for taking over the bank in a time of difficulty and
a sop, if you will, should be thrown to them and that possible
improved earnings could reduce the strain on the capital.
/

But the Board simply disagreed, concluding that the
low capitalization factor was such a serious problem that steps

IS
hac to be taken now, that persuasion and suggestion and urging
of improvement was not enough, and that the Board had to insist
upon application of its 8 percent rule,
QUESTIONS

And what about the Comptroller’s view

of this?
MR. SHAPIROs

The Comptroller originally recommended

against the transaction on the ground that the bank’s capital
was too low.

Later he changed his mind on the theory that the

injection of $1 million in debt and $1 million in equity weald
be some improvement in the situation.

And indeed it would.

Initially, capital in the bank would bs raised some­
what , but it would still b© $1-1/2 million short and that is
the objection of the Board.

And even with this injection of

capital,, it is not close to the standard that it should be.
QUESTION 8.

What sanctions are available on the part

of any federal agency for the bank’s failure to meet the
standards you are referring to. apart from the application for
a holding company?
MR. SHAPIROs

Apart from denial of the holding company,

it is in theory possible that the Comptroller could commence
a cease and desist proceeding involving a ferial«
QUESTION;

Which he did not do here?

MR. SHAPIRO3

He did not do here.

He has relied

extensively on moral persuasion end urging for improvement.
the reason for that is obvious.

This trial procedure is a

And

16
highly cumbersome, time-consuming proceeding that may end up
nowhere.

By that I mean that if there is an order to cease

and desist from being undercapitalized and market conditions are
such that stock cannot be sold, there may be no way to comply
with the order,
QUESTIONi

So the holding company regard it because

it is kind of a goody that is held cut in exchange for giving
up this rather extended proceeding that would be necessary if
the bank did not want —
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, if the Board or the Comptroller

had to conduct a trial and an appeal and a Judicial enforcement
proceeding every time that they needed to correct a capital
deficiency in some 400 cases at the Board alone, they would be
doing nothing else but conducting these kinds of trials,

(and until it is determined that the resources of the bank and
the holding company are adequate in the judgment of the Board.

1?

And what that means is that this 8 percent test has to bs mat.
And it is perfectly common in this industry for a bank that
seeks a change in status to have to pass a test of financial
soundness.

And until it does that, the application's approval

is withheld.
Thai is a common procedure under the Federal Reserve
Act, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Company Act.
QUESTION:

But those Acts specifically authorise that

sort of test, do they not?
MR. SHAPIRO:

In this Act the legislative history

makes very clear —- incorporates these same standards.

Congress

said that the very same considerations that are used under the
Federal Reserve Act and under the FDXC Act should be applied
under the bank holding company —
QUESTIONi

They did not say it in this Act.

MR. SHAPIRO:

They said it in the House Report to the

company, and they used the term "financial resource".
after all, is a resource?

And what,

The literal definition of that term

means something set aside and extra, additional support.

That

is the dictionary definition of the word "resourceM, and that
is just what capital is in the banking system.

It is a cushion,

something extra, something set aside as insurance against
pa-xt earnings, against bad loans, against unexpected demands
from depositors or other creditore.
S© resource adequacy is what we are talking about when

18
we are talking about capital adequacy.

I think the statute

literally read supports us directly this history that I referred
keying this statute, to the Federal Reserve Act supports us
directly and the whole history before that tinder the 1933 Act
supports us directly where Congress expressly said that the
holding company should be a source of strength to an under­
capitalised subsidiary and that if capital was inadequate efc
tha application stage, that is a ground for denial.

That has

been the pattern since 1933.
And for that reason we think that not only the
history but the literal text is four square behind ns.

We

would expect respondent to point to something in the history
that suggests that the Board’s inference is incorrect about
its own statutory authority, but respondent has not don© that.
And I think that that is testimony to the support of the nature
of this history.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, I just want to clear on©

thing up in my mind.

You mentioned that if you had to get a

cease and desist order in undercapitalisation situations that
you would be engaged in almost constant litigation.
1 gather from that — and is this a correct inference
— that the problem of banks not complying with your 8 percent
rule Is a very common problem.

A lot of banks do not comply

with it, is that right?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Since 1970 400 applications have been

19
held to be deficient under this standard under the Holding
Company Act alone.
capital in banks,

And that is just one agency scrutinising
And in each of those cases the Board has

insisted on —
QUESTIONS

You mean there are 400 applications in

which the acquired banks• capitalisation did not meet the 8
percent tost and that was the reason for denial?
MR, SHAPIRO;

That is correct.

And the denial was

combined with an improvement at a later stag® resulting in a
replenishing of the needed capital.
And the Board’s testimony before the Senate in 1976
was that this has resulted in the injection of some $2 billion
in additional capital.

And so wa are talking about a recurrent

problem that is dealt with, we think, economically under —
QUESTION;

Well if there are 400 banks that this

was a problem in that were subject to application, I presume
there must have been a lot- of other banks that were not involved
in proposal to transaction that also ware deficient in capital,
is that right?
MR. SEAPIROs
QUESTION?

That is correct.

So that maybe it is almost a. characteristic

of the banking industry that they do not satisfy this particular
criterion,
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, we know that that is not true

because the Board has made a statistical analysis

of basks

20
within different peer groups*

And within this peer group which

is a sis® criterion the average nationally is 9 pereant, and so
the Board’s 8 percent standard is somewhat lower than the
national average.

It is a problem in many cases, but on the

average the banks do better than ‘the Board’s standards.
But that is not to say that it is not a recurrent
problem that has to be dealt with in an economical way under
the Board's supervisory powers.
QUESTION:

And is a flat rule of the Board that no

one bank holding company will be permitted to be organized if
the bank to be acquired has a capital ratio of less than 8
percent?
MR. SHAPIROs
■■a flat rule as it could
QUESTION:

I am informed that it is as close to
possibly be.

I believe that it is,

Is the rule contained in a written regula­

tion anywhere?
MR. SHAPIRO*

It is contained in the uniform system

which hi.3 been in existence since 1969.
tine to time in Board opinions»

It is referred to from

It is contained in the banking

treatises that bankers rely on and it is constantly the subject
of discussion between, bankers and bank examiners when there is
a. case of undercapitalization.
QUESTION*

And than basically what they do, they never

allow any change of status or anything to the bank unless it will

21
make the change to comply with this standard?

MR, SHAPIRO;

Well, a bank that was below the 8 percent

standard would not get into the Federal Reserve System until
it improved*

The holding company that sought to acquire it

would get holding company status until it was improved and
FDIC insurance would not be had until the capital deficiency
was improved.

It is a vary serious matter,

QUESTION;

Well, do banks lose their FDIC insurance

whoa they get below this amount?
MR. SHAPIRO;- Pardon ms?
QUESTION s

*

Will the beak lose its FDIC insurance

coverage if its capital ratio falls below this percentage?
MR. SHAPIRO;

That is such a draconian sanction that

it has never been done.
QUESTION;

It just will not grant new insurance to

a bank that does not comply?
MR. SHAPIRO;

Well, if this bank were denied its

FDIC insurance, it would mean that it would go into receiver­
ship .

It is a national bank and it lias to have it.

methods other than the ultimate weapon are used.

And so

And one

weapon, of course, is just urging from the regulatory authorities
to improve, but that has proven to be inadequate.

In this

case it has proven to be inadequate.
The Comptroller urged this bank repeatedly that its
capital funds picture should be replenished and restructured to

22
a fully acceptable level and that the Board of Directors should
take immediate steps to achieve that end.
QUESTION:

The Comptroller —

The denial of the application has not

achieved the end, I gather?
HR. SHAPIRO:

Not to this date because it is still

in litigation and, of course, they hope for success which
Question?

And if the FDXC wins the litigation, then

its objective will not be achieved?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, wo hope that it will be achieved

through the offer of new equity securities by the bank, by
finding new venturers at the holding company level, or by
retaining earnings for a period of time in the bank.

Any of

these steps could be employed to replenish the capital base.
And if that occurs — arid it should occur within a reasonable
period of time — then this respondent is free to return to the
Board to get a fresh appraisal of its application.
We are not being obstructive? we are not standing
.in the way»

When this improvement takes place, we will give

the application a fresh consideration and we welcome that
return from respondent.

This is not the death knell to the

formation of the holding company I would stress.
1 would also stress that the Board’s interpretation
of this law which baa been in assistance sines the early ’60s
and has bean applied again and again in denials of holding
company applications which have been published, this

23
interpretation has been in existence during the period of time
when Congress amended the law.

It amended it in 1966? it

amended it again in 1970 and it did not express even the
slightest disagreement with the Board's policies.
And under this Board's decision — this Court's
decisions when Congress amends a law without disagreeing with
a visible and obvious policy of this sort, that amounts to a
ratification by Congress of the agency's interpretation.
And this Court has said repeatedly that the greatest
discretion is owing to an administrative agency's interpretation
of its own enabling statute.

And that argument applies a

fortiori we say when there have been two amendments of the law
without any hint of disagreement.

And, of course, this policy

of strong capitalization has been at the base of the Congressione
concern in this area since 1913.
QUESTION;

Mr. Shapiro, has any other court considered

MR. SHAPIRO:

I noticed that myself, Your Honor, with

QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Respondent asserts that because a.

ground for ua to stand in the way, that wo are being arbitrary
and capricious because the milk has already been spilled.

The

damage is clone, they say, and there is no reason to make a

But we say that the situation should be improved and
that new powers and new status should not ba conferred until
that improvement takes place.

And I do not think there is

anything arbitrary or capricious about that.
The old maxim about greater rights, presupposing
greater responsibility, we think applies fully in this case.
QUESTION:

How do you relate that specifically to

this statute, that doctrine?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Under the statute the Board is directed

to consider in ovary case financial .resources and the legisla­
tive history says that these considerations of financial

25
soundness and managerial soundness, the so-called banking
factors, are the basis for granting or denying and if the
applicant has not shown sufficient responsibility to raise
capital to minimally adequate levels, then the statute we say
authorises a flat denial until the applicant approves the
condition of the bank and meets minimum Board standards.
Mr. Chief Justice, I see that the white light is on
and 1 request your leave to reserve the remainder of my time
to reply.
MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Vary well.

Mr. Collina.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE B. COLLIUS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF TEE RESPONDENT
MR. COLLINSs

May it please the Chief Judge and this

honorable courts
The transaction here involved does not change anything
except for the better.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago

wrote an analysis of this transaction which was quite full and
which pointed out that the — I think their exact language
was that the bank would bs severely prejudiced or severely
hindered if the transaction were not allowed.
The reason for that is that by this transaction —
by the formation of this holding company the bank will — or
the entity consisting of the bank and its owners will benefit
by $130,000 per year.

Right now the amount would be- $160,000

a year because it is based upon the current average interest

26
rate *
Now if the court please that is a large benefit and
that is why the bank sought holding company status*

In Illinois

having a bank holding company a one bank holding company is of
no particular great benefit from a business point of view.

You

cannot open branch banks with it? you cannot have multiple
holding company banks? you cannot do anything with it except
really do what the voting trust does now,
Mew the bank has a voting trust right now where the
four men who are involved belong to this voting trust and that
voting trust dees exactly what the holding company will do which
is sit there and vote every year at the time of election of
directors and receive a dividend and use the dividend to pay
interest on the lean which exists.
How in this transaction there is absolutely nothing
new created by the transaction.

Thera is only a reshaping in

form from a voting trust to a holding company which will per­
form precisely the same function as the voting trust.

QUESTION:

Mr. Collins, I take it you are not defending

fch i judgment below on the theory espoused by the Seventh Cir­
cuit, however?
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

You are not?

MR. COLLINS:
wrote correctly.

I am, Your Honor.

I am.

I do contend that Judge Fairchild

I contend that Judge Fairchild wrote correctly

2?
when he said that "in order to strike down a transaction or
to deny a transaction, there must be something about that
transaction which in some manner causas some detriment to some
banking factor."

The Board denies this, Your Honor., on the

basis of a policy decision, a basic aconoroie policy decision.
And I think in that respect I differ very much with counsel.
*

Counsel puts that to Your Honor here today that the Board has
the right under their reading of the statute to decide basic
economic policy to fix an 8 percent rate which they affixed
no place in any written regulation.

They have not one piece

of paper, not one thing that is published as a regulation that
X. know of that says & percent.
Thay have the right to say that and than to deny on
the —
QUESTIONS

They have the power to say that?

MR. COLLINSs

Well, they might have the power to make

such a regulation.
QUESTION:

You mean that is the argument?

MR. COLLINSs

That they surely have not made such

a regulation.
QUESTION:

Right.

ME. COLLINS:

X do not know that they have that

power»
QUESTION:

Weil, you say they do not.

MR. COLLINS:

Well, it would seem to me to be this,

28
that they have the pow«r coaly to relate to the specific trans­
action.

Is this transaction a good one or a bad one?
Now if Your Honor please, the Board has many powers,

the power over money policy in the United States which does not
involve hearings? it does not involve a record.

They meet onea

a week and decide if we are going to ba richer or poorer or what­
ever they decide.
But that is not what this is„

This is supposed to ba

a judicial type decision, where you take a record in a case
and decide yes or no.
QUESTIONS

Certainly, the Board could have a general

rule though by which it treats a number of applications.
MR. COLLINS?

If they do, it does not appear from

On© of them is

They are not judicial

They do not appear to be — they do not really go

with precedent.

They simply say that this is a strain and that

is not.
In this instance, I would suggest that the primary
I

29
regulation of a bank is through the Comptroller of Currency.
And X think it important that the Court understand that banks
are heavily regulated by a most responsible and competent
regulatory authority.

There are basically threes

the FDXC,

the Comptroller of Currency1', and the State Banking Authorities .
In this instance, it is the Comptroller because it is a
aaclonal bark and a member of the Federal Reserva System, 1
would acid,
QUESTION?

Well, you take the5 position that the

Board had no authority to make this decision at all?
MR. COLLINSs
No, sir.

No, sir.

Please do not put me on that.

They had authority to decide the case.
QUESTION?

Well, you said the Comptroller of Currency

'had that authority.
MR. COLLINSs

No, they had the authority to decide

the case, but this is how it is supposed to work according to
the statute.

The Bank applies or the holding company applies;

the Comptroller is then asked to pass judgment upon it before
the FRB does,

The Comptroller — if the Comptroller says no

because the banking factors are adverse, then you get an
evidentiary hearing before the Federal Reserve Board or some
delegate thereof.
If the Comptroller says yes on banking factors, then
yon still have the competitive factors, the antitrust factors,
that must then be decided and the Board can then decide the

30
cas© on the antitrust, end competitive factors and review the
Comptroller on the so-called banking factors.
Now as Congress wrote it and as it would appear to
me to have been intended to ha written, and as Chairman Burns
said when the 1971 Bank Holding Company Act was passed, the
Federal Reserve Board does not pretend to want to regulate what
goes on in3ida a bank.
said that,

He said,

And Mr. Burns said? Governor Bums

“We do not want to regulate banks.

That

is up to the Comptroller."
Now the Comptroller has plenary powers over banks.

do about, it.

And you are.

They can go in a bank and say you
There is really very little you can

You go to a hearing later.

So the Comptroller has very full powers to do as
he wishes with the bank and he has the primary responsibility.
And in this instance the Comptroller exercised a very basic
primary responsibility and said after there was a change, go
ahead.
The ironic thing is that the change the Comptroller
proposed the Federal Reserve Board did not like.

They said •—

one of the items in the record here says that the Federal Reserve
Board regards it as less favorable — that the changes that the

31
Comptroller required is making the proposition loss favorable.
So you have the situation where you have essentially two
regulatory foodies having input into one decision.

But it is

supposed to be a judicial —
QUESTION?

May I

interrupt you just a minute?

The difficulty with the argument you are now making as X
perceive is that the Comptroller has authority only to make
a recommendation to the Federal Reserve Board with respect to
the formation of a holding company.

The Congress made the

choice of putting the decision-making authority in the Federal
Reserve Board with respect to a holding company.
MR. COLLINSs
QUESTION:

Very much so,

The Comptroller can only make a recommenda­

tion ,
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:
•v

Please do.

MR. COLLINS:

to the application.

May I respond on that point.. Your Honor?

The Comptroller has the duty to respond

He may respond yes or no.

If he responds

yes, than it is decided by the Federal Reserve Board without
any hearing.

They simply take the papers, the documents that

are presented.
If the Comptroller says no, then the Federal Reserve
Board is obliged to grant a

hearing.

My point is that some

status is given toy that statutory scheme to the Comptroller’s
acquiescence or non-acquiescence.

And the Comptroller remains

32
in all events the primary regulatory authority over the bank
and the Federal Reserve Board does not pretend, according to
its Chairman, to govern what goes on inside a bank or to
concern itself with the day-to-day capitalisation of the bank,,
QUESTIONS

How all of that is true, but Section 3

imposes the obligation on the Board to considar the financial
conditions not only of the bank but of the holding company —
MR. COLLINSs
QUESTION?

Correct„

—■ and the future prospects of both so that

your reliance on the Comptroller seams to me to be perhaps
misplaced to soma extent,
MR, COLLINSs
QUESTION:

Well, if Your Honor thinks so, then —

Wall, it is relevant, but I am talking

about the ultimate responsibility,
MR. COLLINS:

But the point that I would make is that

the decision that they are to make is supposed to be a judicial
decision end. not an economic decision.

The Federal Reserve

Board —QUESTION:

Well, what authority do you have for that?

MR, COLLINS:

That is a statute that it impose an

obligation to decide the competitive factors, that it comes
out of the Bank Merger Act,
the Bank Merger Act,

It is taken whole right out of

The legislative history to which counsel

adverts just does not exist for this statute except for the
Bank Merger Act.

33
QUESTION;

Are you arguing that the financial conditier

of a bank is a judicial decision rather than an economic banking
decision?
MR, COLLINS;

Wall# ao,

I think ifc is up to the

Comptroller whether or not a bank should open tomorrow morning»
And lie makes that decision everyday as to every bank in
America.
And I do not know that that is a judicial decision
unless it was a case of gross abuse.
there has ever been such a case.

And I do not know that

But my point to Your Honor

is that the decision of whether to allow or to withhold the
privilege of a bank holding company is one which is accorded
or not accorded in accordance with judicial principles and not
as part of the money policy of the Federal Reserve Board.
QUESTION;

Well, except, Mr. Collins — maybe I am.

simply repeating the concern expressed by my brother Powell,
but the statute enacted by Congress clearly provides that in
3very

case — that is in every application to become a bank

adding company — the Board shall take into consideration the
financial and managerial resources of the bank*3 concern.
MR. COLLINS;
QUESTION;

Correct.

It imposes a statutory duty upon the Board

in every case to take those concerns into consideration.
MR. COLLINSs

X have no quarrel with that because

'io me what that means is that you view this case and this

34
record and if there is anything abort this transaction which
harms any one of those considerations or does not even —- you
could even say does not benefit the situation upon these
considerations that it is entirely proper for the Board to
take that into consideration —
QUESTION:

Well, it has to in every case.

That is

the will of Congress,
MR, COLLINS:

Certainly.

But the point is that in

this case they are denying this status, 1 suggest, as part
of their basic monetary policy of the United States and not
because

of anything good, bad or indifferent about this case.

And I think that is the difference between the open market
committee or the money type actions of the Board and this
pa rti eul ar i tern.
QUESTION:

Well, the Board simply says we took into

consideration the financial resources of the bank concerned.
MR. COLLINS:
QUEST!OH s

In their opinion.

And which Congress directed us to do in

every case.
MR. COLLINS s

The most that can ba said is that they

claim in their opinion which is in the petition -- they take
the position that because the owner of this bank, the holding
company will owe money which is already owed and has been
owed for three, four years now — because they owe money that
the holding company could -— that this debt could prevent

35

the holding company from resolving any unforeseen problems
that may arise at the bank.

That is language right out of

their opinion at 26a of the Petition for Certiorari.
Nov/ if it is the point of the Seventh Circuit opinion
— and I believe it to be correct; X hope it is — that they
have to see something wrong with this transaction, with this
particular transaction, some way in which this transaction is
harmed by a holding company status before they can deny the
benefit of $160,000 a year tax saving to this ownership entity.
Now the ownership entity exists right now and right now it
owes $3,700,000.

If there is a holding company, they will still

owe it; they will still owe it personally because they have
to guarantee the note as the lender would require and does
require.
So nothing changes except there is $160,000 benefit
per year that goes towards reducing that debt.
that is not created now.

That is $160,000

So essentially, what is dona here

by the Federal Reserve Board is they are saying that the tax
laws of the United States -- you may not have the benefit
of this tax law because you did not do something else that
we want you to do, which in our monetary policy we believe
you should do.
Now their monetary policy is not really written

because it changes so much.
that the government cites —

There is evidence in the book

How could they?

In one breath you say

that that is thair job and then In your next breath you say
that they should not do it when it comes up against my bank.
MR. COLLINS:

I think that is the difference between

this Court and any judicial body and an administrative body, ancl
I will agree with Your Honor that they will have a hard time
doing that.
But I think they have the obligation when they have
the judicial decision to make —
QUESTION:

Where is the legislative history that

you get any of this?
MR, COLLINS:

The legislative history — if I may,

the legislative history is that this is a judicial type
decision and a judicial type decision means you have got to
too fair to tooth sides and act equally among all parties, and
that is what © judicial decision should —
QUESTION:

Well, I should assume that any adminis-

t rative body is obliged to do that whether judiciary or

And I think

that that is different from their general administrative

QUESTIONS

the parties?
MR. COLLINS:

The parties would ba the applicant

QUESTIONS

That is not a party situation in the normal

MR* COLLINS:

In the administrative law context, X

think it might foe considered that.

The Federal Reserve Board

in Chicago strongly recommended this in the strongest of terms.
They said the bank would suffer severe detriment if it were
not granted.
The people at staff here — of course, we do not
kvow that as it goes through.

You only learn that when you

gat the record, but the staff hare said, no, they did not like
i■; because it was in conflict with the current posture was
their words — the current posture of the Board, the current
policy of the Board.

And so they said this does not comply

with our current policy.
Ail right.

Than the Board has to decide what is

right and what is wrong*

And I think when they decide that,

t ay ara deciding between two contentions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Collins, I am having a little difficulty

39
following you when yon talk about the Board decision in this
case being based on the Federal Reserve Board's monetary
policy.

Is that referred to by the Board in this decision?
I®, COLLI NS:

So, it is not.

I base that upon an

analysis in a book that the government cites called "Haller,
Guidebook to Holding Company Law".

I believe it is page 123

to 130 of that book which I just read yesterday and which says
plainly that up until 1974 they wore very liberal with the
formation of these holding companies and they tended to approve
them.
Then in 1974 when there was economic difficulty in
the country, they decided that they would change their policy
and attempt to get more money into the banking system by
refusing the holding companies and by making the banks come
u> with more money in order to start them.
Now Mr.. Shapiro this morning —- my good friend here,
argues that they are right because they have the right to
require more money simply as part of their general governance
of the American economic system.
QUESTIONS

That is not really what the Board said

in this case.
MR. COLLINS;

No, it is not.

It was the observation

of the author of that book that whatever they say in their
opinions -- what they do is they decide things on the basis
o * policy

40
Now the internal Board report which — or the staff
report to the Board which is in the Appendix uses the words
"current posture"»

Counsel argues here today forcedly that

it is policy that causes them to do this and that they have
the right to deny this tan advantage because of policy that
banks should have more capital.
QUESTION:

Well, any time you are adjudicating a case

involving a particular applicant like your client here, you
make the adjudication on individual factual determinations, but
then you apply policy to them, do you not, whether it is
legislation or rule-making or what?
MR. COLLINSs

My point is that it should be at .lea*t

some kind of written policy that someone can know.

And for

them simply to deny it on the basis of a record when in fact
or. the facts of the particular case nothing but benefit flows
from it, I think that is just plain arbitrary, wrong and
capricious because when the problem will ba on its way to being
solved if they will grant the holding company status, which
ir. Illinois means nothing as far as other businesses are
concerned — if they will but grant it, then we are $.180,000
a, year towards solving every problem that there is.

If they

deny it, we are not,
QUESTION:
I

But suppose the Federal Reserve Board,

leaking down the road as their business, includes that anything
that will encourage speculation in bank stocks at a particular

41
time is bad for the whole monetary system.

Then do you say

they cannot take that policy into account?
MR. COLLINS:

If that policy were applied to this

case, they would grant the holding company because when four
people own stock that is tied up for many years that is not
readily salable because it is closely held, and where they have
to keep the 80 percent block together to qualify for the tasc
consideration, then in this case it would not — the application
of such a policy would leave them in an arbitrary and capricious
position.
I do not know what the deciders of great questions
consider.

I have never decided anything.

But to roe If they

have a record before them, they should docide their case on the
basis of the record before them and upon the harm or good to
be done out of that transaction.
QUESTIONs

Just for this one transaction —

MR. COLLINSs

I would think so.

You so judge — if

a man does an armed robbery, you judge the one transaction.You
do not convict him because of the general policy on that.
QUESTION;

Well, but the Federal Reserve Board has

got somewhat different function, has it not?
MR. COLLINS;

Well, I think in this instance the

way the statute and the procedure is written, I think they
have the duty of deciding two antitrust questions, and I think
you could consider this part as part of the antitrust

42
consideration or you can consider separately*
Wow in the Third National Saak case, which was written
and decided in this court eleven years ago, the same language
out of the Bank Merger Act was held to apply to the specific
transaction as viewed through an antitrust -- in an antitrust
„

perspective.

So this language has been precisely interpreted

in that, statuta as having to do only with the antitrust
considerations of the case, and having to do only with that
specific circumstances and net otherwise.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Collins, I have read a few of these

opinions over the years and uniformly the Federal Reserve
Board and also the courts treat about three basic elements
in analysing these requests.

The competitive factors are

one? the Antitrust Division second guesses the Board on those.
Then the banking factors are the second package of things that
the Board and courts look at.

And finally, the Board looks

at the convenience of the community, whether or not the
community will b© better served, the convenience and needs
of the community.
So I do not quite understand how you can say that
all the Board is concerned with is the competitive factor.
MR. COLLINSs

I was pointing out, if Your Honor please,

that the same language in the Bank Merger Act —• it has exactly
the same language —
QUESTION?

Yes, that is right

43
MR* COLLINS:
Court.

— has so bean Interpreted by this

I agree that 'fcha Federal Reserve Board certainly looks

at it as Your Honor describes, but the Bank Merger Act was
not so construed in the Third National Bank ease
banks at Nashville, Tennessee,

which involved

It just was done differently.

And I wanted to bring up one other point.

In the

legislative history argument they go back to a statute passed
in 1933 which would appear to require the holder of bank stock,
if a corporation, to have certain financial standing.

Well

if Your Honors please, that was because in the *30s there was
a law that said bank stock holders ware personally liable on
their bank stock to the extent of the par value of that stock
in case the bank failed.
a time.

Now there was such a law once upon

It is Section 64 of the National Banking Act and then

64-A repeals that as to bank stock acquired after some date
back in the

%]9s.

And it is no longer the law.

Now there was once a very real and precise reasoning
— reason for requiring the owner of bank stock to have a
certain financial status.

Now the Board here tries to make

that old law back into the law by saying that the owner of
bank stock, if it is a corporation, should have a lot of money
so that if there is trouble at the bank, they can coma up with
the money.
And that is what they say in the opinion in this case,
that they want the applicant — the holding company to have

44
money to come up vflth*
anymore.

Now if that — that is not the law

The owner of bank stock can own nothing except

that bank stock if he is an individual.

Ha can foe as poor

as can foa and it is not against the law to own bank stock,
no matter how poor you are in other matters.

You can only

own that stock and you can owe on it to 100 parcent of its
worth end you can still lawfully own it.
.I think that the legislative history that counsel
cites is undercut by the fact that in the initial writing of
tie laws on this subject, there was then existent this law
requiring that you make up any loss in a bank if you are a
stockholder to the extent of the par value of that.
If the Court please, we contend that the Seventh
Circuit was right, that if it does not make any difference,
it should not make any difference? that this transaction does
not harm anyone and that it is a correct transaction.

And

I thank you all.

REBUTTAL OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHAPIROs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the courts
1 would, differ with Mr. Collins with great deference

45
on the question of monetary policy.

This case has nothing

to do with monetary policy in simple terms.
Monetary policy is concerned with the level of money
in the general economy and it is regulated through open market
transactions, Reserve requirements and through the interest
rate at the discount window at the —
QUESTIONS

How would you say that relates, if at all,

to the desirability or mdesirability of speculation in bank
stocks at any particular period?
MR. SHAPIROs
Your Honor,

Is there some nexus there?

I believe that that is a separate question

The point I would like to may, if I may, is that

this case is dealing not with money supply but with the safety
©": banks.

It is not concerned with aggregate demand of the

economy but with the cushion of equity in the banking system.
And Me. Collins referred to Mrs. Heller's treatise.
I think that if the court reviews that, it will make very
clear that the policy that we are talking about her© is the
capital cushion for bank safety.
because banks were failing.

In 1974 that became an issue

There war© several large failures,

including the Franklin National Bank, and the Board decided
that at this point in time that these strict capital standards
wore essential to the safety of the banking system.
The argument was made that the Board's opinion was
too cursory.

411 U. S. 138,

X refer the court briefly to Camp versus Pitts,
This is a case we have not cited, but it deals

/
46

with the adequacy of banking agency's opinion in denying an
/*

application.

The opinion is about three years old of this

Court, 411 U. s. 138.
And I would say in closing that the Comptroller does
not have the final word hero.

As this Court said in the

Whitney Rational Bank case "Congress had no Intention to give
the Comptroller a veto over the Federal Reserve Board under
the Federal Bank Holding Company Act .11

And we think that this

case should be viewed from that perspective because the statute
is explicit that the Board makes this decision and th© Comp­
troller merely advises.
