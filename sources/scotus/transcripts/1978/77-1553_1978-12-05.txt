ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. STEWART, ESQ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STEWART %

Mr. Chief Justic©, and may it please

th@\Court:
This is an employment discrimination ease in which
th® tire department @£ the County ©£ Los Angeles was found
liable in order t© make future hire in, accordance with a
quota for blacks and Mexlean-Americans until the fire department
achieved racial parity with the surrounding county population.
The case raises the issue of whether 42

u.S.c.

Section 1981 embodies constitutional equal protection standards.
It requires a showing of discriminatory intent to establish a
violation of that statute; or whether Title VII standards, in
which intent is irrelevant, are applicable.
Since the discriminatory hiring took place prior to the
Marsh, 1972, effective date of Title VII as to public agencies,
tuis ease raises the issue ©f whether through 1981, Title VII
standards can be applied retroactively as to public agencies„
Ins other fundamenta1 issue is whether the quota
hirrng order mandating 40 percent minority hires until racial

4
parity is achieved, is within the remedial authority of the
trial court under the fasts and the findings of the o&se„
This employment case is different from others of
recent vintage in that it comes before the Court with an express
finding by the trial judge that the County of Los Angeles had
not ©ngaged in any intention discrimination,
Th@ county has long administered a traditional civil
service aptitude test for firefighters as well as other applicants
for eeaaty job®, similar to those .utilised by the District of
\

Columbia in Washington va Davis,
Other testing criteria for this particular job were
a rated oral interview, 59 7“ minimum height standard, and
physical &ml mental tests — medical tests.
This action was brought in January of 1973 by
plaintiffs, none ©£ whom were prior unsuccessful applicants
for the position.

And they challenged only two exam criteria.

Two written exams — one given in 1969 and one given
in 1972 — and the height standards, and these were the only
exam criteria shown to have a disproportionate impact on

minorities.
Now, the administration of the 1972 ease was
somewhat unique.

Because after the 1969 exam,' the County of

Los Angelas, in an attempt to increase minority representation
in the fire department, and to reduce any disparate impact of
their tests, decided fc© go to a random selection method.

5
In that regard, they .administered the written tests
in January of '72, graded it? 97 percent of the applicarits
passed.
The Comity9s intention, then, was to draw by raSdom
selection applicants from those that passed — the 97 percent

\

that passed — and then proceed with them through the regular
process£ the oral interviews and other portions of the exam
which had not been shown fe@ have any adverse impact.
Unfortunately, the random selection method was
enjoined by another lawsuit on the basis that it violated the
civil service previsions.

Consequently, there was no hiring

by the County during the two years ©£ the pendency ©f this
litigations
Finally, in desperate straits because of the shortfall
©f firefighter personnel, the County proposed to interview the
top 540 applicants ©a the written exam for the purpose of filling
til© immediate requirements of the Fire Department,
There was no hiring, however, for approximately two
ysars prior to the effective date of 'Title VII as to public
agencies® until after the judgment in this case.
The law — the threat of the lawsuit intervened, and
there was -- consequently the County never did effectuate the
intent to interview the 'top S44 applicants, but proceeded with
them all through the remaining stages of the examination
process, sad no adverse impact» nor was there any discrimination

6
ia the compiling of the subsequent eligibility list.
During the ferial, the court found no intentional
discrimination on behalf of the County, but in reliance on
Title VII standards, held the County liable because of the
written exams in 1969 and 1972 had a disproportionate impact
©a minorities and had not been validated.
The court upheld the height- standard.
The court went ©a to propose a remedy for the purpose
©£ eliminating ~ or remedying alleged past discrimination, a
remedy of 29 percent black® and 20 parcent Mexiean-Amerieans
hired until complete racial parity was achieved between the
County Fire Department and the community ©£ the County ©£
L&m Angeles.
The Hinth Circuit, ©a re-hearing, raised — on
re-hearing after the County raised 'the intent issue in the
wake of this Court8s decision in Washington v. Davis,
reversed the trial court’s Hit,© finding, upheld the quota
order, and upheld the finding of discrimination in the us© of
the test© on Title VII ground®, notwithstanding the lack of
discriminatory intent, expressing the holding that intent was
irrelevant under Section 1981, as it is under Title VII, and
that there was no operational’ distinction between Titi® VII
liability and liability based on Section 1981»
W@ believe that the circuit court seriously erred
in holding that Title VII liability principles apply to Section

7
1981» and that no'.intent to discriminate need be established.
This Court in Griggs v, Duke Power» articulated
judicially the disproportionate impact standard» based on
this Court's interpretation ©f Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.
This issue — the issue in this case*, then» really
revolves around the intent ©f tha 39th Congress in the
original enactment of a statuta that we now know as Section
1381? rad the effect» if any, of Congress0 enactment of
Title VII in 1964.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Stewart» you've undoubtedly seenthe

Solicitor General's amicus brief in this case suggesting that
the case boils down to a lot less than it seemed to after the
revised opinion of the ninth Circuit.

v

Are you going to discuss that at soma point in your
argument?
MR. STEWART2

Yes» I will» Mr,! Justice Kehnquist.

I did also discuss it in my reply brief.
Perhaps I could-address it now.

I’d just simply

state that I think the government’s position was wrong or» that
point? the quota hiring order in this case was designed to —
was clearly designed to remedy past discrimination» and it was
clearly predicated upon a finding of violation of Section 1981.
That clearly raises fetes issue of the standards of
liability under Section 1981» which we feel have to be resolved.,

8

If the Court determines that constitutional equal
protection standards apply t© Section 1981, then under the
trial court's finding in this ease that there has been no
deliberate discrimination, then we believe that the quota
hiring order must fall in its entirety»
The quota hiring order is still in effect»

The

County has been obeying that quota hiring order sine© judgment
was entered in this case*,
The ninth Circuit Court ©f Appeals did not disapprove
of the hiring order®

It expressly approved ©f the quota

hiring order, stating, w® do not necessarily believe that the
one«one:three hiring rati© is incorrect.
QUESTIONS

But am I right in thinking that you concede

that you were governed by Title VII from March, 1972, on?
MR» STEWARTs
QUESTION8

We do.

And that the Court of Appeals concedes that

the only gap in this period was between January and March of
'72? that is, that the last time there was any effort to
administer the test was in January, '72?
MR. STEWART:
©£ 1972.

The test was given in 19 — January

It lay fallow while they attempted to resolve the

question of the randan selection method.

The test was never implemented in a disproportionate
manner in that there were hirings made basedon rankings in
feh© test

9
The Coiraty never did go ahead and interview any of
the top 544 applicants on the test»
the entire 97 percent that passed»

They want and interviewed
They interviewed them in

January of — in January and February of 1973# and then compiled
an eligibility list at that time# and an eligibility list which
was conceded by the plaintiffs in this case not to have been
d©n© in a discriminatory manner .
QUESTION?

Well# wouldn't it be possible for this

Court to vacate the decree ©f the Court of Appeals and on a
standing basis , and simply send it back to the district court
or the Court of Appeals for re-framing of an appropriate
remedy, considering what a small tail is left of the case?
MR. STEWARTi

Well, there is still the question of

feh© appropriateness of a remedy under any presumed Tifclve VII
violation that may have occurred.
The plaintiffs have claimed that our uneffectuated
\

attempt to interview the top 544 rose to the level of a Title
VII Violation.
I do not believe, however# that they contend that
that's justified —
QUESTIONi

Well, the Court ©£ Appeals didn't hold that.

MR. STEWART?
QUESTIONS

No, they did not.

They haven't dealt with Title VII.

MR. STEWART:

Well — the Court of Appeals, quite

frankly, Mr. Justice White, is quite confusing.

They've

10
intermixed the standing questions with 1931 and Title VII and
so forth.
I read that ease as holding us to a violated Section
1981, notwithstanding the lack of inteat, and that ~ uphold
the quota hiring order for the purpose of remedying past
discrimination which could only have occurred'under Section 1981.
QUESTIONI

W©11, I wouldn't think — I would think that

you would suggest that if there were a Title

II — if there's

some claim on the other side about Title VII, the Court of
App©©Is should first address Titia VII »
B5.R0 STEWARTs

Well, the Court ©f Appeals did address

that ©tabj @©te
QUESTIONS

Y©s, .but it rested its final holding on

1981, you just said, is the way you read it.
MR. STEWARTt

As I read it.

But the Title VII

question was also before them, and I implied that they found
Titi® VSX violation© „
QUESTION:

Hay I ask what you understand the 1981

violations to have been, and when it occurred,, and who it
affected?
MR. STEWART:

I understood, from the reading of tae

Ninth Circuit appeal -- Court of Appeals decision that the
1981 violation consisted of the utilisation of the 1969
written exam and presumably the height standard that had an
adverse or disproportionate affect on minorities, without

11
showing that it was 'Validated,
QUESTION:

Wow 'with respect to the 1969 test, it's

correct, is it net, that there are no plaintiffs who were
affected by that test?
HR. STEWART:

That is correct.
t

QUESTION:

Then how can that be before us?

MR. STEWART:
QUESTIO:N

Pardon, sir?

Then how can we have a 1981 issue arising

out of the 1969 test?
MR. STEWART:

We have the 1981 issue' because the

quota order, which the court approved, is predicated on the
1981 violation,, since the -QUESTION:

Do you argue that the order should be

set aside because there is no plaintiff entitled to that
relief before the Court?
MR. STEWART:

I think the quota hiring order could

be — could be vacated on the basis that it was accepted and
that it seeks to remedy alleged discrimination for which
plaintiffs have no standing to represent the parties.
QUESTION:

Then we don’t have to reach this 1981

issue, do we?
MR. STEWART:

Well, I think it’s a significant

perhaps on a technical basis.
QUESTION:
about it.

Maybe we should write a law review article

12

MH» STEWART;

There have been many written about it

But I think it's a critical issue that is really before the
Court;, because the quota hiring order is predicated upon the
upon the finding of the 1981 violation»
And as I will note in a moment, I think there is
significant problems with finding no intents standard under
Section 1981»

The adverse consequences under the unfortunate

procedures of Title 1 and VII.

The one, the effect on cases

that are currently pending with other governmental agencies
that have been sued around 1971 and 1972 before Title VII
became effective as to their discriminatory acts in which the
Court said that intent was not required.
And it implies the question of the applicability
retroactively of Title VII to public agencies whodo not
become subject to Title VII until 1972»
But. we believe that Congress in 13 —- or the
39th Congress, when they enacted Section 1381, could not have
had the Title VII adverse impact validation standards that
arose through the Court's Griggs decision in mind.
The purpose of Section 1981 was to remove the
legal disabilities of blacks, and to provide them with equal
protection of the laws.
There are certainly many civil service tests that
are administered by the federal government subsequent to
enactment of Section 1981 that probably had disparate impact

13
on minorities, and Congress could not have intended to out lav/
those tests simply by showing that they had disparate impact.
The impact on the enactment of Title VII in 1964
on 1981, I submit, was very little if any.

Congress considered

1981 to be a separate and independent statute.

There appears

to be no indication that they intended to change that statute
or to remove that remedy.
This Court, in Johnson v% Railway Express, held that
the statutes certainly were overlapping and related, but not
necessarily that they employed the same standards of liability.
Certainly, they're related to the same end of
eliminating discrirainatio.no

They apply to racial discrimination.

They both apply to employment discrimination.

And they both

apply to intention discrimination.
But that is
Title VII standard of

not to say that they both

apply to the

liability predicated upon a showing of
\

disparate impact.
The constitution itself overlaps to those ends as
well.

The Court held in Washington v. Davis that the

constitutional standards for discrimination were not the
same as those for Title VII.
The argument is raised that they should construe
Title VII

in paria materiae with the Civil

old Civil Rights Act,

now in Section 1981.

Rights Act — the
This strikes a

rather discordant note, because the 1964 Civil Rights Act
expressly excluded public agencies such agencies such as the

14
County of Los Angeles, for its coverage.
So you cannot graft onto Section 1981 Title VII
standards, by leaning on the rather weak stem of the Court —
of the Congress' enactment of Title VII in 1964, because
they obviously intended not to extend that coverage to public
agencies until 1972.
To hold that the intent is irrelevant under Section
1981 I think would have adverse conseqsequences? It would
permit circumvention of Title VII procedures that were
laboriously debated in Congress,

It would extend Title VII

liability standards to employers that Congress intended to
excluded.
Cases have come up recently in the lowers courts,
.Johnson v. Alexander,

where the government argued that the

Army was not subject to Title VII.

But if suit could be brought

under 1981, and apply Title VII standards that way, then the
distiction — or the exclusion of the military from the
doverage of Section — of Title VII in 1964 is relatively
meaningless.
Similarly, in Johnson v, Ryder,

the claim was made

that a bonafide seniority system was illegal by attempting to
apply Title VII standards through Section 1981, despite this
Court's ruling in the Teamsters case.
The

recognizing an intent standard for Section 1981

15

will not adversely impact upon the enforcement of equal
employment opportunities, because Title VII is now applicable
to public and private agencies»
The plaintiff still has the benefit of Section 1981
in private and public cases where they can show, we believe,
deliberate discriminatory nintent.
It does not mean that the statistics are not probative
on such a 1981 action, as this Court indicated in Arlington
Heights»

But they can be probative for proving the question

of intent.
But that is a far cry from saying that the Title VII
standards of having to show job relatedness applies»
Now I would like to address the quota issue»

As I

stated in response to an earlier question, the quota was
predicated upon a violation of Section 1981.

It would follow

that if there has been no violation of Section 1981, because
there had been no showing of intent, the quota would fall.
Now, we're mindful of the decisions of the lower
court, including the observations of this Court in Bakke,
that a quota hiring order may be appropriate as a remedy in
cases of proven discrimination.
The issue in bar, however, in regards to the quota,
is not the appropriateness of quotas in general, but whether
the one entered in this was was overbroad,

not properly

tailored to the extent of the proven wrong.

There was an

16
excess of the Court8s remedial jurisdiction.
There's a clear distinction that has to be made
between liability and remedy.

The quota is a remedy; it's

not a device to achieve racial parity.

But it must be related

to the proven wrong.
The proven wrong in this particular case was the
1969 test, which had a disparate impact on Mexican-Americans;
and the height standard.
The quota as a remedy should be applied with
caution, because it impacts on innocent third parties, not
like applying a remedy of back pay, where it's a question
between the employer and the employee.
But the quota remedy obviously adversely impacts on
innocent third parties who would be denied a job if they
weren't a member of the — or beneficiaries of the quota
themselves.
So we must balance the rights of the victims as
against the rights of innocent third parties.
Judging feha quota order in this case, we feel that
it is clearly excessive.

It wasimposed to remedy past

discrimination and not to assist the plaintiffs, none of whom
had been prior applicants.
It was not limited to the actual ascertainable
victims of any discriminatory practices.

It was designed to

cure presumed discrimination, no matter how remote in time

17
it may have occurred,
The County fire department was composed of individuals
who had been hired over a 25 to 30 year period,,

It’s one of

those positions like law enforcement where there's concern
where for long term retirements and so forth„

And so there's

little turnover in that department.
So the quota order in this case presumes a pattern
of discrimination extending far back beyond the 1969 test;
even beyond Title VII5s enactment in 1964,

Discrimination that

was totally unproven.
An anomaly of the

case is that individuals who may

have bean victimised by any discrimination would have their
claims time-barred, EiS they have not filed in time.

But

minorities who have not actually suffered discrimination would
gee a preference under this quota at the expense of non-minor —
of whites and other minorities, not blacks and Mexican-Americans,
who are not the beneficiaries of the order.
Thus, ve feal that the quota in this particular
case has now achieved the character of a device to achieve
racial balance, and not a remedy for proven discrimination.
In fact, the findings say that it's designed to cure
past discrimination, as indicated by the racial imbalance of
the department,
How, of coarse, as has been mentioned from questions
from your Honors, the fact that the plaintiffs have no standing
to represent past applicants indicates that the quota order

18

was not designed to remedy any discrimination as far as they
were concerned, but was designed to remedy presumed past
discrimination, discrimination that apparently the court
felt would have resulted in the County department then being
at racial parity.
Thera is no evidence as to what the racial composition
of the County fire department would have been, even had no
discriminatory practices been utilized in past years; no
consideration of the racial characteristics of the demography
of the County of Los Angeles, whether there’s been an increase
or decrease in blacks or Mexican-Americans over the years.
The quota order —
QUESTION;

This exam was given in 1972, it was given

in 1969, and had been given periodically back over the years,
had it not?
MR. STEWART:
QUESTION:

That’s right, Your Honor.

Was it an identical exam., or just the

same type of exam.
MR. STEWART:

It was the same type of exam.

had been some changes over the years.

There

Thera was no evidence

we could ascertain as to the effects of the 1968 exam, which
was the one immediately preceding the 1969 exam, or no .records
as to previous exams.,
The only evidence in the trial was — as to the exam
content itself I think was the 1972 exam, and the statistics

19

relating to the impact of the 1969 exam»
QUESTION:

And no evidence in years prior to 1969

as to even who had taken the exam in terms of affect?
MR» STEWART;

That’s correct.

But there was a slight

bit of evidence as far as 1968 was concerned.

The percentage

of minority applicants for the “68 exam was extremely low.
I would say -- it5s in the pre-trial order, and ites in the
appendix, but I would say it was somewhere in the vicinity of
about 3 percent or 4 percent minority applicants for the 1968

exam,
QUESTION:

And only applicants would have taken the

examination?
HR. STEWART;

That’s correct, Your Honor.

But that’s

contrasted with the 25 minorities who took the 1972 exam, which
was the result of an active recruiting effort the County had
entered into in the intervening years.
QUESTION;

Because part of the claim, the original

claim, in this casee was that the discrimination led to very
few applicants because of the practice of present members of
the fire department to tell their friends and cousins and
brothers about it, and to let them into the firehouse to give
them soma practical experience and to prepare for the exam
and so forth; that there was no such recruiting or even
availability of the knowledge of the availability in — among
Negro and Spanish-American groups; isn't that correct?
MR. STEWART;

That was one of the allegations, but it

20

was unproven *

And there was

QUESTIONS

■

And the fate of that allegation was •—

the district court did not rely on it, nor did the court of
appeals?
HR. STEWART:

That’s correct.

And there was no

finding that they had engaged in discrimination.
And.to the extent that there was any intent involved,
I think that was dissolved by the Court’s express finding that
the County had not

had not engaged in deliberate discrimination.

And to the contrary, the court’s finding was that the county
■had made efforts to recruit more minorities for the fire
department.
QUESTION;

While you’re interrupted, perhaps you

could explain to me if you can what the basis was for the
Court of Appeals stating in footnote 6, right after it had
held that the 1969 test was irrelevant in this case because the
applicant list had been exhausted before any of these present
were applicants.
They had not been effected by the 1969 test.

But

that second paragraph, footnote 6, it is equally clear that
defendant’s decision to employ the 1972 .written test as a
selection device was an unemploy—• was an unlawful employment
practice, which had adverse impact on the racial class of
plaintiffs»
Now, you’re insistence is that although the 1972
test, was given, the only time that any — any time after that

21
when you hired people, you claim it was conceded that there
was nan-discriminatory hiring.
MR. STEWART;

Yes, but it's been conceded there

has been no discriminatory hiring.
QUESTIONi

So your claim is — your claim is that

the 1972 test has not had an adverse effect on any of these
plaintiffs?
MR. STEWART;

That8s correct.

And I think they

conceded that in their answer.
QUESTION?,

So what is the basis -- so what is the

basis for this second paragraph of footnote 6?
MR. STEWART;

I believe it's an indication that the

Court felt — or the Ninth Circuit felt that the mere threat
to utilise the test by interviewing the top 544 rose to the
level of a Title VII violation.
QUESTION;

Is there some finding one way or

another with respect to the 1972 test, in the district court's
opinion?
MR. STEWARTs

Yes, the district court found that the

1972' test violated 1901 and Title VII.
QUESTION;
test.

Well, I know, just looking at it as a

But it — did it find that these particular plaintiffs

had been adversely affected by the test?
MR. STEWART;

No, it did not find that they had

been adversely effected by the tost.
QUESTION:

In fact, the plaintiff —

Well, did it find they hadn't?

22
MR. STEWARTs

Well, I think that it was unnecessary

for the court to do that, because the plaintiffs themselves
in their second amended complaint, alleged that we had stopped
using discriminatory hiring practices, and conceded that they -QUESTION:

Well, again —

MR. STEWART;
QUESTION;

— were not adversely affected.

Because if the Court of Appeals is wrong

in what they say in the — in this second paragraph, isn't the
case over?
MR. STEWART;
QUESTXON;

Well ~

Because they've already said that the 1969

test didn't involve any illegality because it hasn't affected,
anybody?
MR. STEWART;

Well, the,! case, the Ninth Circuit

decision, Mr, Justice White, is, in my opinion, in explicable.
But the case is not over because they approved a quota hiring
order —
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but I don't mean ■— what

I mean is, that shouldn't you win if they're wrong in that
statement?
MR. STEWART:

Yes, I think we should win, sir, and

that is exactly my position —
QUESTION— without going t© 1981.
MR. STEWART:
QUESTION;

Pardon?

Without going to 1981«

23

MR. STEWART:

Or 19 — or Title VII or anything

else.
QUESTIONs

Just standing.

MR. STEWART:

Just standing alone I think could win

the case for me,
QUESTION;

Well, your suggestion is that there3s no

basis in the district court's finding for that statement?
MR, STEWART:

The district court did find that the

county had violated sections 1981 and Title VII.
QUESTIONs

But they didn't find that these plaintiffs

had been affected by the test?
MR, STEWART:

No, they did not.

There's no question

that these plaintiffs had not bean affected by the, you know,
by the 972 exam,
QUESTION:

You see, the Court of Appeals not only

said the 1972 tost was an unlawful employment practice, but it
said ifc had an adverse impact on these plaintiffs„
MR. STEWART:
QUESTION:

Is that footnote 67

Second paragraph of footnote 6.

It said it was an unlawful —
MR. STEWARTs

Well* the court must have been implying

that the threat t© utilise the 1972 test in a method that
would have had an adverse impact if implemented, adversely
affected, and it gave them standing to challenge the 1972
test

24
QUESTION s

But in any event, you don't know of anything

in the district court’s findings that support, that part of this
statement?
MR e STEWART s

Hot at the moment , sir „

I will reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal„
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Hunt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. THOMAS HUNT, ESQ.,
On BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HUNT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
On the .

standing point, it is important we believe

fee note that the holding of -the Ninth Circuit that these
plaintiffs did not have standing is based entirely upon the
fact that the scope of the class was defined as present arid
fufeure

applicant.
The Court of Appeals, at page 1334, specifically

stated, in light of the fact that plaintiffs' class did not

MR. HUNTs

Yes, the next sentence after that sentence.

Beginning, defendants have challenged?

In light of the fact that plaintiffs' class did not
include any prior unsuccessful applicants, it follows that
plaintiffs neither suffered nor were threatened with any
injury in fact from the use of the ’69 examination.
Now, we must concede that the scope of the class in
this case did not include past applicants.

The record is

26

perfectly clear.
And logically, we must concede that it does follow
that past discrimination cannot be attacked, and logically
from that I'm afraid we must concede that the kind of relief
that was obtained in this case is hard to justify.
Because the fact is —
QUESTION;

Don't get to the relief yet; don't get

to the relief.
What about standing?
MR. HUNT?

That's what I'm just talking about.

I believe — our position is that the plaintiffs in
this case — the ease was litigated as if the plaintiffs in
this case had represented past applicants.
The original complaint was pled on behalf of past
applicants.

The law is clear, they could have represented

oast applicants.
The cases, Mr. Justice White, are cited on pages

They were, Your Honor.

QUESTION?

How were they?

MR, HUNT?

They were — the defendant was about to take

class.

We brought the lawsuit, and the defendant stopped.
So they were threatened with discrimination.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but they — I take it

you don't claim that this class — that any of them were ever

That’s correct. Your Honor.

QUESTION:

You. think that's enough to get soma relief

if you concede that none, of your class members was ever

MR. HUNT:

We do not think that. Your Honor, and

that's why we think that this case should be remanded to the
district court to correct the oversight.
QUESTION:

Well, is it true that none of them was

ever rejected based on his performance onthis test?
MR. HUNTs

That's correct.

QUESTION?

And counsel, if your “— if you disagree

with the Coart of Appeals in this language that we've been
going over and over,

in light of the fact that the plaintiffs

class did not include any prior unsuccessful applicants, it
follows plaintiffs neither suffered nor were threatened with
any injury.
If you want to upset that conclusion, you would have
to cross-petition for certiorari, wouldn't you?
MR. HUNT:

Your Honor, we decided not to cross-

petition because the record is clear to us that it was a mere
oversight by the district court that past applicants were not
included.

29

The case was tried as if past applicants had been
representedo

The evidence all want into trial as past

applicants.
QUESTION:

But the Court of Appeals just turned

that around.
MR. HUNTt

They turned if around, Your Honor.

And

it was our intention to correct it on a remand, and we 8re

MR. HUNTs

Your Honor, the record in this case shows

beyond question that it was a mere oversight, and the over­
sight should be corrected.
And I8d like to reiterate the reason the record is
clear.
First of all, the original complaint was pled on
behalf of past applicants? page 4 of the record shows that.
Secondly, at the trial, evidence came in as to past
applicants.

QUESTION;

Mr, Hunt, did you ask for monetary relief

They were not

beyond — they were not beyond the statute of limitations period
for equitable relief, because —
QUESTION:

Well? but if they8re beyond the statute

cam there be to sending it back and asking thatthe judgment

MR. HUNT?

Yes, Your Honor.

The difference it makes

is that if that case -- the hiring order, 40 percent hiring
order based on past discrimination is appropriate.
X agree with Mr. Justice Marshall's point that he has
made at least twice here in questions to me that this is a
very confused situation,

to get the matter back to the district court in order to

order actually is going to be.

And X suggest that that is

what should be don®.
The point X must reiterate is that it is not true

\ ^

that the liability in this ease was only based on two tests.

The liability on this case basically was an unrebutted prima
£aei© ease, which this Court in the Teamsters case recognised
as being an appropriate way to establish liability in^eapjs

such as this.

MR. HUNT s

Y@s.

QUESTION s

And 1 suppose that the opinion should be

40

read in the realisation that that6s what the case was.
MR. HUNTi

Yes.

And this case was a class action

which we all believed was brought on behalf of past, present
and future applicants, and we were attempting to establish the
prima facie case by the sarnie way as the government did in that
/

case.

(
i

And our statistics did so.

The district court

specifically recognised those statistics.
The problem that we face here is not only the
confusion on everyone9s part as to whether past, present and
future, or just present and future applicants, were represented,
but in addition we have the problem that there was been a
remand on — assuming there is to be a hiring order, how much
the hiring order should be.
And again, it's difficult to deal with a case where
we don't have a concrete situation.

And for that second reason

we agree with the government as we did in the opposition to the
petition for certiorari, that the remand should be carried
out.

We should — this Court and the parties before if

should have a concrete situation before us.
The — perhaps the most important point on standing
is — and 1 would reiterate coming back to a questionby Mr.
Justice Stevens — that these plaintiffs did have standing
fees represent past applicants.

We've cited a long line of eases

at pages 43 and 44 of our brief, Your Honors,, which show that

41
past

— present applicants can represent past applicants and

vice versa.

Employees can represent applicants.

QUESTION:

Are there oases from this Court?

HR. HUNTs

Your Honor, those cases are all — the

answer to your question is no.

They are all cases following

this Court's decision in other areas of the law.
This Court has never ruled on the specific issue in
the employment discrimination area.
other areas,, such as shareholders’3

It has ruled- on it in
derivative suits, and other

types of class actions that you don’t need a plaintiff for
each and every minor

part of the class.

For example, it8s important to note in this case
that the test used by the county that was in the process of
being applied' t© the current applicants were also used in
earlier years.
My opponent indicated there are modifications.
There are minor modifications — were very minor.

Those tests

were put into evidence as Plaintiffs' Exhibits 3 and 4, the
past tests as well as fehs present test.

And under those

circumstances it’s clear to us that if these plaintiffs did
have standing to challenge and bring a lawsuit on bahalf of
past applicants as well as present and future applicants.
The 1981 issue comas before this Court assuming that
past applicants oar- be and ware represented.

The — it was

interesting to me to read the argument made by the comity in

42

their reply brief, which was just filed last week.

tod I

would direct the Court's attention to the argument made by my
opposing counsel that the Court of Appeals did affirm a hiring
order, and almost an assumption that the oversight will be
corrected on the remand»
And it's at that point that, we gat to the 1981

ir. ent of the issues to be tried.
QUESTION;

I appreciate that.

But what I asked is;

Is there any express provision that the pre-trial order shall
replace the pleadings?
MR. HUNT;

As far as I can say right now, Your Honor,

no, except that I would interpret the joint statement of the
issues to be tried

to supersede the pleading.

QUESTION;

I see.

MR. HUNT;

Ana I would note the very first sentence

is, whether or not as a question of fact and law defendants
have engaged -- that’s past tense.

QUESTION;

Mr. Hunt, while you’ve been interrupted -

you and we, echoing you, have used the phrase, quote, the
oversight, unquote. I (don’t ■ know how many times during the
course of this argument»
What do you understand the coverage of that phrase
to be?

Merely that the word, past, was left out

of the definition of the scope of the class.

MR. HUNT:

In the class certification order that is

found in the judgment»
QUESTION;

And are we to assume when we call it an

oversight that this is something

you said your brother on

the other side and you worked this out together? that he would
freely and willingly do -- quite willingly do, and say, oh yes
this was just an oversight, and that the court — the district
court would freely and quite willingly do, saying, oh yes,
it’s just an oversight?
MR. HUNT:

I think it should be remanded to the

district court to determine that.
Did Justice White have a question?

far.

it was an oversight, and to straighten out this difficult
situationo

18 — you didn't read all the way to his conclusion -- whether
or not as a question of fact and law defendants have engaged
in employment practices violative and so forth as concerns
past and present black and Mexican-American applicants.
MR. HUNT;

Yes, that's true.

That's correct.

QUESTION s

Is it not also true that in paragraph

10 on page 31 that defendants reserved their position that
evidence of discrimination before the effecti.ve date of Title
VII was inadmissible?

They were arguing the 1981 point at that

point, and that's

the substantive issue before this Court.
QUESTION;

I notice also that you talked about

monetary relief earlier, there is an agreement that monetary
claims, the claim of back pay, would not be tried, and that it

were being included in tha class,
MR. HUNT;

Your Honor, we had determined as best we

could that there were statute of limitations problems, not with
the equitable relief, but with the back monetary relief under
1981.
QUESTIONS

But apparently there were — but you were

careful to preserve the rights ob ack applicants who might have
such claims to litigate the statute of limitations question,
MR. HUNT:

That's correct, Your Honor,

We did that

because we didn't want to prejudice somebody if we were wrong
in our view.
QUESTION?

Because apparently none of the named

plaintiffs were in that position, I suppose.
MR. HUNTs

Not — we were —

QUESTION'S

That rather dramatically demonstrates how

there can ba a conflict of interest between a named plaintiff
who is a current applicant, and members of the class who are
past applicants who might have a damage claim.
MR. HUNT:

Your Honor, we were doing our best we

could for the past applicants.

We determined that their

monetary claims were of no value,

49

We sought injunctive relief on their behalf-

And

we based the relief we sought on the discrimination against
them o
I would submit there was no conflict-

If they had

had valid monetary claims, we would have pursued them.
I think it's important to come back to the point
that — and emphasise the point that Mr. Justice Brennan
has pointed out, that the statement of issues to be tried
does concern past applicants.
XtBs unfortunate — X8ve been able to reach the 1981
point.

I would say only that we believe Johnson v. Railway

Express, the thrust of that case, is that the plaintiffs should
succeed in that point,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further, Mr. S tewarfc?
MR. STEWART:

Yes, Your HOnor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. STEWART, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART;

The plaintiff has suggested that we're

jointly responsible for the oversight.

To that I would like

to plead not guilty before the United States Supreme Court.
Actually, counsel prepared it; I approved.
But the point is — and I"m not attempting to mislead
counsel at any time during the course of the trial.

But I

raised the standing issue in my answer, which is in the appendix.

50

2 raised the standing issue in a motion in opposition
to certification of the class»

1 raised the standing issue

and reserved it in the joint pre-trial statement at, page A19.
QUESTION:
of the

But did you agree with that paragraph one

pre-trial order?
QUESTION s

You say you reserved your position with

respect — at that time?
MR. STEWART%

Is that what you said?
Yes.

In the pre-trial order,, on page

19 e I stated defendants are in no way prejudiced as to their
assertion that this action may not be maintained as a class
action.
QUESTIONS
one.

I agree.

Bid you agree ■■—
MR. STEWART?

But what about the paragraph

f
Paragraph one was merely a statement

as to what they represented.
QUESTION?

Was it -- not — it says a joint statement

ofissues to be tried.

A joint statement.

MR. STEWART:

Yes, I agree to everything that's in

the pre-trial order.
QUESTION?

So you agreed to that part of paragraph

©ms which sard that there shall be a trial as concerns past
and present black and Mexican-American applicants.
MR. STEWART:
QUESTION?

Reserving my objection —

Reserving or not.

MR. STEWART:

—■ that they had no standing to

51
represent those past applicants»
QUESTION:

But I did agree to that?

MR. STEWART:

Yes, I did agree to that.

But I

continued throughout this trial, including briefs filed with
the Ninth Circuit both tines, objecting to the standing of the
plaintiffs to represent the class.

And it's not merely a

question of pleading, because there are no past applicants that
are named defendants in the case.
QUESTION:

Of course the court didn't live up to the

rules -- the court didn't live up to the rules in waiting until
judgment to certify a class, did it?
MR. STEWART:

No, that's right too, sir.

But we have raised these points continuously, and
we have continuously lost on all of these points:

the 1981

issue, the application of Title VII, the standing issue.

7-md

everything through the Ninth Circuit.
We hope that we will not lose the case before this
Court.

But I think the issues on Section 1981 and the intent

are important.
Counsel indicates that he'd like the matter remanded.
And that would bring, of course, the 1981 intent issues 'to the
fore again.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2 *.11 o'clock, p\,m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.
