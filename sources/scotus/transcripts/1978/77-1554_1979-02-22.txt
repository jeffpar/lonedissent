PROCEEDINGS
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in County Court of Ulster against Mien,
Mrs. Shapiro,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. EILEEN F. SHAPIRO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRS. SHAPIRO:
two issues.

This habeas corpus proceeding is on

The first issue is waiver, and the second is the

constitutionality of the New York State evidentiary presump­
tion which provides, with certain exceptions, that the presence
in an automobile of any of the weapons enumerated in the
statute is presumptive evidence of its possession by all
persons occupying the automobile at the time that the weapon
is found.
The threshold question here is whether respondents
have preserved the question of the statute9s constitutionality
for habeas corpus review,

considering that respondents failed

to object at trial to a jury instruction which only partially
explained the statute and again failed to object either at
trial or on their state appeals to the constitutionality of the
statute itself.
A consideration of both the facts of this case and
the applicable law compels the finding that respondents have
indeed failed to preserve any substantive constitutional claim
for collateral review.

3
The facts in this case are not is dispute»

The

respondents and a 16-year-old girl, who was later adjudicated
as a youthful offender and was thereinafter referred to as
Jane Doe, were riding in a car on the New York State Thruway
in upstate Ulster County when they were stopped for speeding
through a work gone.

The driver, Respondent Lemmons, produced

a license and a registration»

A radio check was made, and it

was determined that he was wanted on a Michigan fugitive
warrant.

He was arrested.

When one of the policemen, Trooper

Askew, returned to the vehicle, he looked in through the right
front passenger window and detected protruding from a lady’s
handbag, Jane Doe’s handbag, on the floor of the front seat of
the car a .45 automatic pistol.
Q

It is clear that it was Jane Doe’s handbag?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor, it is clear.

There

is no dispute.
He reached in, removed that gun—which turned out to
be fully loaded, I believe with modified hollow point bullets—
and found underneath that gun a second gun, a »38 Smith and
Wesson revolver also fully loaded.
The officer placed all three of the remaining occupants
of the car under arrest and then attempted to enter the trunk
of the car.
respondents.

The trunk key was not recovered on any of the
It was not in the car.

And so when the car was

returned to the barracks, the trunk was pried open? and the

4
police found therein a pound and a half of heroin and a »45
caliber spitfire machine gun also loaded with 27 rounds of
ammunition.
All four of the passengers were indicted on three
counts of felonious weapons possession and one count of
narcotics possessions a charge which in New York at that time
bore a potential life sentence.

As the record clearly shows,

all the parties---•the respondents and Jane Doe--mounted a
cooperative defense, although they were individually repre­
sented by counselo
In particular, respondents directed their aspect of
the defense toward rebutting the articles in the trunk of the
car, the heroin count and the machine gun count. And Dee's
counsel, Mr. Goldberger—who parenthetically is representing
respondents in this proceeding1—directed his attention toward
the handgun in the car.
Q

I thought that Jane Doe was tried in a juvenile

proceeding.
MRS. SHAPIROs
Q

No, she was tried jointly.

As a co-defendant in this—

MRS. SHAPIROs

As a eo-defendant, and it was not

until sentencing that the trial judge set aside her conviction,
adjudicated her a youthful offender.
Q

So, there were four co-defendants.

MRSo SHAPIROs

Absolutely, yes.

5

At the close of the people's ease, the respondents
and Jane Doe made a routine pro forma motion to dismiss, which
in New York is rarely granted as jeopardy may often attach
should the motion be erroneously granted and then on appeal it
cannot be reversed*
The respondents* motion in particular was directed
toward the fact that as the handguns were in Jane Doe's
handbag, they were on her person under the meaning of the
statutory presumption at issue, and thus they could not be
held responsible*
The trial court, agreeing with the district attorney,
found that the location of the guns, since they were not
actually in Jane Doe's pocket or whatever, was a question of
fact to the jury? and thus he denied their motion*

In fact,

respondents Hardriek and Allen even appeared to concede in
tliat motion, which is reproduced on page 17 of the appendix,
that in fact the judge may have been right that it is a question
©f fast*
At the close of the entire case, all counsel joined
in moving to dismiss the machine gun and
against Jane Doe*

heroin charges

In other words, Jane Doe's lawyer made the

motion, and counsel for the three respondents piped up and
said, "Yes, Your Honor, we think you ought to grant Jane
Doe's motion*13
At summation, Doe's lawyer placed great emphasis on

6
the large caliber of 'the handguns, the weight of the guns,
which amounted to approximately six pounds, the size of the
guns , and in particular the position of the guns in the
handbag—they

were positioned crosswise so as to keep the

handbag open—to support his position that the respondents
tossed the gun in the bag either at the time the car was
flagged down by the police or in the interval when the driver
was bcaing arrested.
Respondents Mien and Hardrick, on the other hand,
placed great emphasis on the absent trunk key and the fact
that the car had been borrowed that very morning from
Respondent Lemmons* brother in Rochester, New York, approxi­
mately 250 miles away from the site of the arrest.

And then

in unmistakable language in their summation these respondents,
Allen and Hardrick, virtually conceded their guilt on the
handgun charges.
Q

They conceded what?

for Allen and Hardrick, said to the jury;

If you think that Hardrick and Allen exercised dominion

and control over the weapons in the purse, then follow the law
as the judge gives it to you on the presumption of what was in

And I think

that this cannot be mistaken as anything other than a con­
cession ©n those charges.
After summations, the
Q

judge charged the jury—

I may be dense today, but I do not understand

why that is a concession.
MRS. SHAPIRO;
Q

Pardon me?

You will have to explain it a little more to me.

Why is that a concession?

There is a concession that they were

in the car.
MRS. SHAPIRO;

No, it is a concession that they—

8
Allen and Hardrick—-brought the guns from Detroit, where they
were coming from, to take to New York City0

I may have missed part of what you read»

Q

And the car was on a trip from Detroit to New

He conceded no more than that, did he, than the

acknowledged facts?
MRS» SHAPIRO?

I believe he conceded more than that»

He said, "Look at these two fellows»

They are going to New

York City, where they are afraid of crime, and they are
bringing these guns with them»

What is wrong with that;?"

He

did not say, "Why are you charging me or Allen and Hardrick

He surely on 22a, just the fourth, fifth, and

MRS» SHAPIRO:

He was anticipating the charge, and you

10

would think anticipating the charge he would also be antici­
pet ting the full charge since he was quite aware that beyondthe-parson presumption was included in the statute, and his
earlier motion indicated to some degree that he felt that his
defendants were entitled to that charge.
Q

Of course Mr. Justice Rehnquist is entirely

correct that fehr lawyer in his summation cannot argue with
what the judge is later going to say in the charge, cannot
properly do so without being guilty of some misconduct.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
Q

I would not think so.

It would appear here that he was reading the

statute just as the prosecution was reading it when you couple
that with the fact that he made no objection -to the charge.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes, I would think so.

And he

certainly made constitutional objection even in the earlier
motion to dismiss.

The Court of Appeals opinion in the habeas case,

the Second Circuit ©pinion, does cite passages from briefs.
But as I read Judge Jas@nss ©pinion for the majority of the
Hew York Court of Appeals, that does not pass on any consti­
tutional question, does it?
MRSo SHAPIRO:

What Judge Jasen appeared to do, it

seemed apparent, is that ha did not view a constitutional

courts, they are essentially the same brief, and it is
repeated throughout the joint appendix, I think you will see
that—Your Honor will see that the claim they were making
essentially is that not that the statute was unconstitutional,
but that the failure to grant them the benefit of the excep­
tion was the unconstitutional aspect, and clearly they had
waived that by their earlier failure to object to the charge»
Q

Why was there never an exhaustion of state

remedies here?
MRS. SHAPIRO?

Pardon me?

Do you contend that there was no exhaustion of

proceedings.
Q

We contended that early in the habeas

The state did contend it.
Have you abandoned that claim now?

MRS. SHAPIROs

It appears that the waiver, which we

argue would bar collateral review in this Court, would bar
collateral review in the state court in the state habeas
corpus proceeding as well, the only state remedy open to it*
Q

If this question was never presented in the state

courts, has the federal habeas statute been satisfied?
MRS. SHAPIROs

I think there is a question at this

stage in the proceeding to require the respondents to go back
through a stata habeas proceeding, considering—
q

is that one of the questions you have raised

12
here?
MRS° SHAPIRO:

No, I have not, Your Honor.

1 have

not raised exhaustion in my petition for certiorari and none
of the questions.
Q

Is the state in position to waive that, this

federal statutory requirement?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

May a state waive that?

The Second Circuit does not seem to

think so.
Q

I beg your pardon?

MRS9 SHAPIRO:

We are not waiving it.

I view it as

in this case a futile exercise.
0

What is a futile exercise?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

To ask these respondents to return

and go through a state habeas proceeding.

If their state

direct appeal is completed, the only method, the only state
procedure they could pursue would be a state habeas.

Q

How do you know what the Court of Appeals would

decide on this question if it was never presented to them?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

On the facial constitutionality of the

statute?
G

On the direct appeal.

If you say the Court ©f

Appeals ©f the State of New York did not pass on this question,
if it was never presented to them, how do you know how they
would decide it?
MRSo SHAPIRO:

I do not know how they would decide it,

13
Your Honor.
Q

Then what do you mean it is a futile exercise to

g© bask to the state court?
MRS. SHAPIRO2
have waited their right

It is our point that in effect they
in'

the state court to even raise the
9

constitutionality of the presumption.
Q

Are you saying that not having raised it ©a

direct reviews- your state courts would not entertain it on
state habeas? is that what you are telling us?
MIS. SHAPIROs
Q

Y@s, Your Honor.

Then why should we entertain it here?

That is

the next question.
MRS. SHAPIROs

That is the point.

It goes around

in a circle.
Q

But in answer t© ray Brothers White and Brennan*,

you do not raise the exhaustion point here because of the
well settled rule that exhaustion is satisfied if there can be
a showing that further pursuit of the question in the state
courts would be futile? is that it?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
©

That is true.

That is our position.

But that still does not answer the question of

the direct appeal and your claim that it was not even presented,"in tile direct appeal and that, therefore, the New York Court of
Appeals was not asked t© rule ©n the constitutional question.
MRS. SHAPIRO':

What I think the New York courts did

14
is that they found that the respondents, by failing to object
to the charge, which in that case incorrectly embodied
statutory presumption, has thereafter waived any claim©
flowing from that failure»
Q

Maybe you ar© quite right that a person who is

convicted in a sfcat© trial court can completely abandon his
appeal in the state system and come directly into federal
habeas?
MRS. SHAPIRO %
that at all.

w©„

No, Your Honor, I have never said

But you cannot appeal through the state system

a claim that you have not preserved at trial.
Q

All right.

So, let us assume that a person is

convicted in a New York trial court.
And then he goes to state habeas.
MRS„ SHAPIROs

He will be thrown out.

Can he then com© feo federal habeas?

MRS. SHAPIROs
Q

Yes, Your

He just does not appeal.

Ho, Your Honor.

MRS. SHAPIROs

not decided by them.

And it was

And it may not be available in state

IS
habeas, but is it available in federal habeas?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
O

Wo, Your Honor»

is not that this case?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

No.

What I believe the New York Court

of Appeals did in the course of the opinion, subject to some
interpretation, is that it held that having waived the
objection to the jury charge, which was the embodiment of the
statutory presumption, the respondents waived all claims
flowing from that waiver, including the facial claim, the asappliesd claim, and the state lav? claim.
I have just discussed the New York Court of Appeals
opinion.

I would like to say that at no stage in the federal

or state proceedings did the respondents give a reason for their
failure to object.

In fact, it is not until their brief to

this Court that they suggest for the first time that the reason
might be inadvertence.

However, I would like to say that far

from being inadvertence, the record belies inadvertence.

The

record shows that the respondents knew the presumption would
be charged, expected it to be charged, that they had a specific
strategy, and the specific strategy they had was to deflect
pressure away from Jane Doe on the handgun charges so that Jane
Doe, a 16 year old with no prior record and everything to gain
and virtually nothing to lose, would not testify against them.
And that is indeed what happened.

The respondents skewed their

entire defense away from putting pressure on Jane Doe, away from

16
pointing an accusatory finger at Jane Doe.

And in fact the

part of Allen and Hardrick's charge that I quoted to the Court
indicates that they were virtually conceding those counts
rather than have Jane Doe testify on the serious life sentence
charge.

And I say this also because it seems unlikely that

counsel, who had so successfully these respondents on the
drug charge—this was actually by any standard a very success­
ful defense-—would have been unlikely, particularly since they
knew about everything that was going to happen at the jury
charge period, would be unlikely to overlook such an important
feature.

And there is also possibly another explanation for

this waiver which may come to mind, and that is that these
respondents were, in a sense, willing to accept a compromise
verdict to allow the jury to convict them on the lesser
charges in the hopes of getting an acquittal on the life
sentence charge.
Of course, respondents have a burden for coming forward
with a good cause.

Here inadvertence does not satisfy the

Wainwright v. Sykes standard.

But if either of the theories

that I have proposed to the Court is supported, by the record—
and .t believe they are—these respondents have failed to even
meet the Fay v. Noia standard.
If, notwithstanding the respondents5 waiver, the Court
nevertheless considers the constitutionality of the presump­
tion, the state submits that the statute is constitutional.

1?
The statute is a carefully drafted statute which embodies
legislation recognition that illegal handguns and automobiles
are closely linked with the commission of violent crimes.

The

presumption provides that the presence in a private automobile
of an illegal weapon is presumptive evidence of its possession
by all the occupants of the car unless one of the exceptions
applies.

There are three exceptions.

There is the on-the-

person exception, which this case involved.

There is an

exception where possession xvould not be imputed to a taxicab
driver if a gun is found in the car.

And the third exception

is if one of the occupants of the car not present under
duress has a valid license.
There are also approximately 15 exemptions which are
contained in another statute, 265., 20 of the penal lav;.

And

these exemptions cover persons who voluntarily surrender
handguns, for example, or manufacturers, shippers, or other
legitimate firearms holders or owners.
The elements of the crime of felonious weapons
possession, which respondents state quite accurately in their
petition for habeas corpus in paragraphs 5 and 6, is a knowing
and voluntary possession.

The requisite mental state mist be

proved by evidence independent of the presumption.

Moreover,

New York has a very liberal definition of constructive
possession.

Weapons must be within the imraedia,te control and

rea h of the accused

and

where it is available for his

18

unlawful use if he so desires.

So, -thus once the requisite

mental state of knowing and voluntary possession is established
through other evidence, the presumption simply permits a jury
to infer that an individual in close proximity to a weapon
has that weapon within his immediate reach and control.

Thus

it merely accords the evidence its natural probative force and
effect.

In such a case the relationship between the proved

fact and the presumed fact is so close that it must satisfy
any test this Court deems appropriate.

And I refer to the

beyond-a -r easonable-doubt test, which is really not that
different from the Leary "more likely than not9' test.
Finally, the statute focuses on narrowly defined
conduct, presence in a private automobile.

As the eases show,

the presumption is applied in a principled way by the New
York courts on a case-by-ease basis, taking every variable into
consideration.
Q

I take it New York is not one of those states

that purports to say that a presumption disappears and you just
disregard it when any contrary evidence suddenly shows up.
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Not when any contrary evidence.

If

there was contrary evidence, for example, that was compelling,
the New York judge certainly need not either send the case to
the

jury

Q

MRS. SHAPIRO:

evidence, that the jxiry could disregard the presumption and
nevertheless acquit the respondents.

20
Q

ffhen none of that has to do specifically or

MRS. SHAPIROt

Q

And he defines possession

Do you think this part of the instruction is
"The presumption or presumptions is effective only

so long as there is no substantial evidence contradicting the
conclusion flowing from the presumption, and the presumption
is said to disappear when such contradictory evidence ia
adduced"?

Is that the New York law?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

The New York law is if substantial

evidence is introduced to rebut the presumption, then the
presumption need not go to the jury.

Q

So, this must have been his opinion that there

had not been any substantial evidence on the contrary side,
or there would, not have been any presumption instruction at all.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Probably so.

And there was no effort

21
made on the part of the respondents , for example, to rebut the
*

presuroption.
Q

Going to the third line of that paragraph o£

the instruction? "You may infer and draw a conclusion that such

what is given and has been approved universally in terms of

certain points would not be permitted on habeas corpus—
MR. YOUNG;

Yes, Your Honor, that is correcto

MR. YOUNG;

Yes, Your Honor.

you were about to say.
MR. YOUNG;

Which is that this direct appeal fully

raised the issue that we are talking about right here.

would like to take Your Honors through the documents which are
relevant to that fact because frankly, from what Mrs. Shapiro

Where do we find it?

MR. YOUNG:

That, is set forth on pages 3,2a through

That challenge, we concede, did not throwout the
constitutional issues.

Twelve to 17, that is five pages.

Will you

pinpoint the first place where it is there.
MR. YOUNG:

Sure.

Let us see, I believe on page 14a

we got .into it most exactly.
Q

You concede that in that five pages you did not

specifieally challenge it on federal constitutional issues.
MR. YOUNG:

Yes, Your Honor, we concede that.

All

that we are pointing out abcut that is that the presumption
was challenged in general teams at that point because the
constitutional challenge cornea forth very clearly later on in
the trial proceedings.

I just wanted to point out that that

is the first instance when the respondent said, “Hey, vie do
not think that this presumption Is applicable in this case."

MR. YOUNGs

That decision is set forth in the

appendix to the petition.

1 am trying to find the beginning'

of it right now.
Q

It starts at page 40a.

MR. YOUNGs

The Court of Appeals suggested that what

happened here was the Nsw York Court of Appeals had decided in
a score of oases over the last several decades that this
presumption was constitutional.

And, therefore, it did not

expressly address that issue in this case.

What it did was

30

simply note in passing, as Judge Jasen does, that this
presumption—-and he says—-let us see, starting at 4 3a he
begins to discuss the presumption.

And he points out the

presumption was enacted because of difficulties in proving
weapons possession without it and because of, therefore, the
urgent need for legislation to make the presence of a for­
bidden weapon

presumptive evidence of its possession and that

such amendment would require the occupants of the automobile
to explain the presence of the firearm, and that therefore
this presumption was enacted, providing that all persons in
an automobile at the time are presumed to possess.
The point is

what the court was saying is that this

is a valid presumption.
<1

But there is no reference in that opinion to any

provision of the Constitution.
MR. YOUNG:

But we argued unconstitufcionality to that

court in our part of that brief.

The Court cannot avoid an

issue by simply not referring to it,
Q

No, but then you must be able to convince us that

your motion raising a constitutional question and a motion to
set aside the verdict in the trial court was timely, that it
should not have been made before that time.
MRo YOUNG:

Let us look directly to that issue, then.

We submit that that motion was entirely timely to raise this
issue for several points--

31

Q

Did the New York Court of Appeals agree with you

on that?
MR. YOUNG:

The Mew York Court of Appeals never said

that the constitutional claim had been waived.

They only said

that a state law claim concerning whether or not the on-theperson exception to this presumption was controlling as a
matter of state law had been waived by the failure to object
to the judge’s charge.

They never said the constitutional

claim had been waived.

And there are several reasons why they

did not say that.
Q

Mr. Young, I imagine one reason may be you did

not make a separate point of the constitutional issue in any
event.

You just argued it in passing during the part of your

argument on the insufficiency of the evidence, did you not?
MR. YOUNG:

Your Honor, it is hard to say that it was

argued in passing.
Q

But if somebody just read the summary of the

argument in the boldface, he would never find a mention of the
Constitution

would he?

MR. YOUNG:
addressing the state.

No.

Well, you do actually in the part
The state argued that it was a consti­

tutional presumption.
O

I see.

But it is under the point the evidence

was insufficient to support the conviction.
MR. YOUNG:

Yes.

If yon will look at the brief to the

32
Court of Appeals, that is set forth in the joint appendix at

page-”
Q

Forty.

MR. YOUNG;

Forty—well, 50a is when the constitu­

tional part of that brief is submitted.
Q

And there again—

Oh, I am sorry.

MR. YOUNG;

—the respondents plainly stated,

secondly, if the presumption is applicable here, then it is
unconstitutional as applied.

In essence, they used exactly

the same argument that they had used to in their motion to set
aside a verdict, namely that­
ch

You will surely admit that you did not argue

that the statute was facially unconstitutionally.
MR. YOUNG;

We will argue that that was preserved,

Your Honor, for two reasons.

One is this presumption has had

a history over the three decades it was enacted of being held
facially constitutional by New York's highest court.

Now,

2254 only requires you to exhaust effective state remedies
before raising an issue on federal habeas corpus.

And this

Court and every circuit court has interpreted that phrase to
mean that where an issue has been squarely decided by the
state's highest court in previous cases, that a petitioner is
not required to argue it again in the state's courts before
raising it in habeas corpus petition.
Q

Coming back to several questions put to you,

where did the Court of Appeals deal with the problem?
MR, YOUNG:

Let us take that in two stages.

First

o£ all, it is clear that the respondents raised a constitu­
tional challenge in the Court of Appeals.

That is set forth

on 50a; that part of our brief is set forth on 50a.

We submit

as the Second Circuit found, that the Hew York Court of
Appeals did not expressly address the constitutional issue
because it had decided it in so many previous cases.

There­

fore, it only noted in passing how important this presumption
was and then went on to address the respondents' state law
argument because that is what the dissenters in the New York
Appellate Division had agreed with the respondents on.
So, in other words, the New York Court of Appeals in
essence said we have decided 15 times already that this
statute is constitutional.
analysis of that now.

We are not going to do a lengthy

All we are going to do is note this

presumption has a pressing need, that it was enacted because
of certain problems dealing with criminal justice.

And now we

are going to go on and address the problem that troubled the
Appellate Division dissenters.

That is how that opinion is

written.
So# like I said, even if they had not made any
reference to the need for the presumption, we raised the issue
and they cannot duck it.
Q

But they did duck it.

They did not respond to

34
your precise argument, which was that it was unconstitutional
as applied to these facts»
MR. YOUNG;
Q

That is right.

And they do not mention that argument.

And the

fact they held it constitutional as applied to a lot of other
facts has nothing to do with the validity of your argument as
applied to these facts.
MR. YOUNG:
Q

That is true, Your Honor, but—

Would you point out in the opinion just what you

are talking about.
MR. YOUNG:

Yes.

The New York Court of Appeals'

opinion is set forth in the petition for writ of certiorari.
Q

I do not know the page„

MR. YOUNG:
Q

At pages*—I have to find it again.

This document that used to be entitled “Brief

for Petitioners."
MR. YOUNG;

Yes.

It still is on mine.

But the one

with the mast fingerprints on it since it has been used the
longest.

All right, that is set forth--the part about the

presumption starts on page 43a and continues through the end of
■the opinion, which
Q

runs—

I want the part that says that this case has

been decided by so many Supreme Court eases.
MR. YOUNG:

No, I am saying that is why they did not

expressly address it here, is because—

35
Q

You gave me the impression that was in the

opinion.
MR* YOUNG:
mean to do that.
Q

Oh,- 1 am sorry, Your Honor, 1 did not

What I am saying is—

Well, you did.

MR. YOUNG:

“-that the Court of Appeals had decided

this in so many previous issues that all they did in this
opinion—
Q

You psychoanalysed them?

MR. YOUNG:

It was enough for the Second Circuit.

The Second Circuit psychoanalysed it the same way, Your Honor.
Q

Then psychoanalyse me because I used to be on

the Second Circuit, while you are at it.
MR. YOUNG:

They thought that it was clear that the

New York Court of Appeals had only found—
Q

Where?

MR. YOUNG:

Where does it say that?
It does not expressly address the consti­

tutional issue.
Q

If I am writing an opinion sustaining your

position, what do I cite for what you just said?
MR. YOUNG:

You?

No, I would cite to the fact that

respondents raised the constitutional issue and that since
the Court of Appeals did not expressly address it but did say
that they felt that this presumption was valid—
Q

Where did they say that?

36
MR. YOUNG;
Q

I have got to get a quote someplace from you»

MR. YOUNG;
Q

On pages—

—43 to 45.

Counsel, take a look at the top of page 51a and

see if that helps you.
MR. YOUNG;

Is that the dissenting opinion?

Yes, I believe that is, Your Honor.

Yes,

■that is Judge Walker’s dissenting opinion in which he says
the constitutional challenges have been rejected in the past
by the New York Court of Appeals.

Judge Walker felt that this

presumption was unconstitutional.
Q

So, that suggests that the issue was before the

court perhaps.
MR. YOUNG;
Q

Well, it definitely was—

It really suggests that the dissenters thought

something about it.

It does not suggest that the court

thought it was there.
MR. YOUNG;

It does suggest that the issue was before

the Court,
Q

It was before the court in People v. Terra—

MR. YOUNG;

But since Judge Walker found it uncon­

stitutional here in this ease, Your Honor, referring back to
Terra, he was clearly saying it is an issue here too.

But

getting back to the point that I was initially making with,
Your Honor, Justice Rehnquisfc, even though the New York Court
of Appeals did not spell out book and vers® what their

37
position was on the constitutional issue, that does not mean
that we are precluded from federal habeas corpous proceedings»
All we have to do is exhaust our remedies in the state court»
We only have

to raise the issue»

If the Court of Appeals

refuses to confront it, that is not our fault? and that does
not preclude us, under 2254, from raising that issue thereafter
in the federal courts.
Q

What if it is an established rule of New York

practice that you must make a motion based on a constitutional
claim at the time the judge charges the

jury?

You make it at

the time you made it in this case, the same procedural history
up to the New York Court of Appeals»

You argue the question-

with the New York Court of Appeals.

Th© majority opinion

simply does not mention the question.

Do you think you can go

into federal habeas on that?
MR. YOUNGs

Your Honor, again you phrase that in

terms of this being a charge case.

Sven if the judge in this

case had made no mention whatsoever of this presumption, even
if he had never told the jury that they could convict on the
basis of this presumption, respondents would still be entitled
to th€3 relief which they have been granted.

That is §© because

fch© state in this case rested their ease without any actual
proof of the crime charged.

Instead, they relied solely on

this presumption.
I would like to refer Your Honor to the colloquy that

38

occurred at the end of the state's case on exactly that»

The

defense counsel had argued that the presumption was not valid
in this case»

Admittedly they did not raise a constitutional

claim at that point»

What is important is that they argued

that it was not valid.

And in response, the court turned to

the prosecutor and said, referring to defense counsel’s
argument, "He is saying that the only proof you have again is
your presumption, right?"
The Prosecutors
The Courts

Correct»

The defendant was in the car, and

the statute presumes.

You have no other proof?

The Prosecutors Correct.
So, this is a case in which there is simply no proof.
And defendants9 right, their constitutional right, attached
at that point.
Q

Is the prosecutor saying "correct" with respect

to the court’s paraphrase of the defense contention ©r
correct to the court's statement that that is the prosecution's
position?
MS. YOUNGs
makes that clear.
a question.
Q

He says, "You have no other proof?" asking

There is a question mark after that.
What page are you on?

MR. YOUNGs
Q

I think the last comment by the court

Oh, 1 am sorry, page 15a.

Thank you.

39
MR. YOUNG?

Bottom of 14a, the last three lines of

14a and the first three lines of 15a.
Q
not proof.

That does not mean that anybody says there was
It just means that there is no more proof than the

fact that the gun and the defendants were both in the same car.
MR. YOUNG:
Q

And that is why—

That does not mean there is no proof.

MR. YOUNG:
0

That is right.

It does if the presumption—

All you are arguing is that you should not be

able to infer possession from the presence of the gun and the
defendant in the car at the same time.
MR. YOUNG:

That is right, Your Honor.

And if you

cannot constitutionally do that, then the prosecution8s case
necessarily falls at that point.
Q

Suppose the judge had said, "All the evidence

you have is that the gun was in the defendant’s hand in the
car.'

Is that all you have got?"
He says, "Correct."
Would that be all right?
MR. YOUNG:

Then they would not be relying on the

presumption, Your Honor.
Q

That is right.

MR. YOUNG:

But here they admitted that they were

relying solely on the presumption.
Q

I do not think you can win constitutional

40

questions on one sentence and one word by a judge or anybody
else.

Only one word 1 know is "acquittal."
MR. YOUNG:
Q

You want to argue every word in there.

MR. YOUNG:
Q

Well—

I am sorry.

No,, no.

I do not quite understand.

1 do not understand what you are

talking about.
MR. YOUNG:

What 1 am saying is that the defendants5

due process rights were violated at the point that the state
rested its case , without presenting any actual proof of
possession but instead relying solely on this presumption.
S©„ if this presumption is unconstitutional, defendants'
rights were violated at that point no matter what the judge
thereafter charged the

jury?

even if the judge had charged

the jury that they could not convict on the basis of the
presumption.
Q

Mr. Young , the colloquy jou referred to of

course was in connection with the motion to dismiss the
indictment.
MR. YOUNG:
Q

That is right,, Your Honor.

Is it correct that Defendant Doe testified?

MR. YOUNG:

Oh, you caught me totally off guard.

It

has been so long since 1 read the transcript, 1 am not sure.
I do not think any ©f the defendants testified.
Q

The dissenting opinion—this is what puzzles raep

41
as Mr. Justice Powell pointed out early “-"refers to the fact
that Defendant Doe, who was the only woman in the vehicle,
expressly admitted that it was her possession.
MR. YOUNG :

I think a police officer testified that

she had made that admission, Your Honor.
0

So, there was other evidence then.

There was

evidence about what was said at the time.
MR. YOUNG:

Only as to Doe9a possession, and Doe is

not a respondent here.
Q

I understand, but there was some oral testimony

about what happened at the time that the vehicle was stopped
and so forth?
MR. YOUNG:
Q

Essentially—

So, there was something more in the record other

than the fact that the guns were in the car?
MR. YOUNG:

No, that was essentially it as to these—

as -to the three respondents.
Q

You just told me a moment ago that the police

officer testified that she made soma remarks concerning the
location of the guns.
MR. YOUNG:

Oh, you mean as to that evidence.

that does not apply to the respondents.

But

It only applies to

Jane Doe.
Q
asked?

Would you mind reading again what the judge

Miss Donovan* the prosecutors
Q

Then that is wrong* is it not?

There was other

evidence.
MR. YOUNG;

Yes* that is all the evidence that they

Q

But they had a lot more evidence than that.

That is all the evidence they relied on to

defeat a motion to dismiss the indictment.
MR. YOUNG;

So, between the seat and Jane Doe they

There is no testimony to the effect that anybody else in that

And logically they could not

have seen them because they were all the way over there®
You concede the officer could see it, but you

Q

say that a jury could not reasonably infer that anyone in that
esir could see it?
MR. YOUNG:

Number on®, I do not think that is a

i© required here®
Q

But, number two, sight is not all that

It is possession, Your Honor®

X am just sticking with one segment of it®

MR® YOUNG:

Y@s®

There is other evidence besides what this

colloquy with the judge indicated®

The evidence is that they

were in plain sight, in the handbag, in th© ear.
MR® YOUNG:

One gun was totally out of sight because

the police officer did not even see it until he had removed the
first gun.

The first gun was in sight only in that the handle

was sticking out of the top of the purse that was located in
that location®

X think it would be a pretty strange infer-

erice-—
Q

The only point X am making is that is evidence

44
from which a reasonable juror could reasonably conclude that
other passengers in the car saw the same thing the officer
did.
MR. YOUNG:
Q

As to the bottom gun?

As to the gun which was in plain sight.

MR. YOUNG:

But they were convicted of both guns.

So,

even if sight alone was enough to convict here, it would not
justify the conviction on the second gun.
Q

Is the crime greater for the possession of few©

guns than one?
MR. YOUNG:
both.

The presumption was used to convict for

So, obviously the issue would be raised as to the

second gun even if Your Honor were correct in saying that the
first gun was visible and that, moraoever, its visibility
permitted a conviction simply because it was visible.
strongly disagree with that.

We

We do not think that even if the

gun was visible to the other passengers that that is enough.
It simply strains the imagination to say that simply because
a gun was visible, that all the people in the car automatically
possess it because it was visible.
Q

The presumption does not mean that everybody

automatically possesses it.

The presumption, as I understand

it, means that 'the jury may look at that presumption with the
rest of the evidence and may draw the inference that everyone
possessed it.

Is that not correct?

45
MR. YOUNG;

Yes.

3uet us look at. exactly what the

presumption does mean.
Q

They do not have to accept the presumption.

MR. YOUNG;

No? they do not.

But let us look at what

the presumption means because it dees not mean what Mrs. Shapiro
described to you.

The New York Court of Appeals has uniformly

held that this presumption authorises a jury* if they so wish»
in most instances to infer possession of a gun t© anyone who
is present, in the ear where that gun is found.
Q

If they come back with a guilty verdict* they

will have violated their instructions unless they have found
that beyond a reasonable doubt ©very member in the car
possessed the gun.
MR. YOUNG;
Q

That is not—

They have been told to find th® defendant guilty

unless* they find the state has proved the case beyond a
reasonable doubt.

And maybe the presumption and the so-called

inference is part of the proof* but they nevertheless have to
be convinced.

MR. YOUNGs
of the

Then* Your Honor* let us look at page 25

joint appendix* which contains -the part ©f the judge’s

charge addressing the presumption.
statement is;

And there his lead-off

"Our Penal Law also provides that th® presence

in an automobile of any handgun or firearm which is loaded is
presumptive evidence of their unlawful possession.

46
Q

So?

MR. YOUNGt
Q

So, that alone could—

It is presumptive evidence, that is true.

But,

nevertheless, it has to be evidence that will convince the
jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
MR. YOUNG?

That is the instruction.

According to the New York Court of

Appeals—and I think this Court is bound by the New York
Court of Appeals interpretation of this statute—the New York
Court of Appeals states, in their opinion, in this very case,
that -the presumption creates a prime, facie ease against the
defendants.
Q

Now, it is my understanding—
I know.

That just means it is enough to get to

the jury.
MR. YOUNG:

MR. YOUNGt
Q

Yes, but based on—

But whatever the evidence is, it has to convince

them beyond a reasonable doubt.
MR. YOUNG?

And the judge was telling him that they

could reach that conclusion based solely on this possession.

I know, but they did not have to.

They did not

No, they did not have but—

You cannot construe the constructions any

other way, can you?
MR. YOUNG;
Q

Yes, I can construe—

If you can, then why do you not corae up here and

claim that some other section of the Constitution has been
violated, that they violated ‘the beyond-reasonable-doubt
standard?
MR. YOUNG;

To a certain extent this does because it

permits-Q

That is not the question you have presented to us.

MR. YOUNG;

I know, because we do not feel that that

is the central issue her®.

What we feel is the central issue

is that the due process rights were violated because the juries
were instructed that they could draw an irrational inference.

hs this Court has said in, every presumption case that it has
dealt with, that 3s enough t© violate the defendant3® rights.
You do not have to also violate the rights by mi®instructing

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

You have not cross-petitioned.

about all these things that were not before th© court and are
not here? am I right?
MR.YOUNG: No.

All the issues that we are talking

about now were before the court.

And decided by the court?

Pardon?

Go right ahead.

Go right ahead.

I am sorry.

I give up.
