ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH REMCHO, ESQ,, ON BEHALF

MR. REMCHOs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case presents the question whether the Common"
wealth of Puerto Rico may constitutionally enact and enforce
feta statuta: evil excising its polios to conduct, indis criminate
warrantless searches of the luggage, packages,' bundles and
lags, and persono arriving in Puerto Rico from the mainland
United States.

That goes to the whole question of whether Puerto

Rico may, in the first place, set up any kind of a customs
search®
QUESTIONS
MR® REMCHQs

That's what I am trying to get at®
Well, let me get to that question

directly and take up the others later®
The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was created by the
commonwealth compact, but nothing in that compact reserved to
Puerto Rico the right in any fashion to set up its own border
between the United States and Puerto Rico®

In fact, with

respect to customs 19 U. S® Code Section 1202(a) specifically
includes Puerto Rico within the United States custom terri­
tory®
The commonwealth compact itself and the additional
Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act includes a carefully con­
sidered set of regulations in the compact between the United
States Congress and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with
respect to how those two parties will relate to each other,
and there is nothing in that compact which I find which
explicitly or implicitly authorises Puerto Rico to set up
any kind of a border between
QUESTIONS

itself and the United States*

You are limiting that, of course, to

5
travelers from the United States, aren't you?
MR, REMCHOs
statute sets up.

Well* that's correct; that's what the

But that is what a border is all about*

people coating from one place to the other* regardless of
vhefcher they are residents of Puerto Rico or the United States
mainland.
The Commonwealth lias taken the position with res­
pect to the border not that they have the power to create
anything like an international border.

The position they

took* below at least* was that they had the power to create
a functional equivalent of a border.

And 1 think that mis-

©nstrues this Court's cases with respect to what a functional
equivalent of a border is.
As the Court held in Almeida-Sanchea* the function­
al equivalent of a border is basically the same thing as a
herder, only for practical necessary
been moved.

reasons that border has

So that, for example* St, Louis is the function­

al' equivalent of a United States border iror a person arriving
in the United States for the first, and the confluence of
two or three roads right near the Mexican-United States border
is the functional equivalent of a border, and that is the
only practical place where U, S, customs officials can conduct
their duties.
The fact here is, in going back to your initial
question* is that the border search cases which allow even

6

certain exceptions, can set up a functional equivalent system
and allow certain exceptions to normal search-and-stop proce­
dures,. where search is conducted by customs officials and
persons authorised to do that.

And

that by its very nature

limited the search.
QUESTIONS

Couldn't the United States put a police­

man on the border between Mexico and the United States —
ME. REMCHO:
QUESTIONs

Absolutely.
There*s no magic in the word "customs;58

is there?
MR. REMCHOs

There's no magic in the word "’customs.*5

You can clearly put one there if there is in fact an inter­
national border.
QUESTIONs

There is.

I am talking about the Mexi­

can border right now.
MR. REMCHO:
QUESTIONS:

Absolutely.
W© have customs agents.

Could they

change their title to policeman?
MR. REMCHO:
QUESTION s

MR. REMCHO $

Absolutely.
And do the same thing?
Absolutely.

But the analogy, I think,

as to when you can put a policeman there and when you put
someone else there applies more to what is sometimes used as
inspection searches? that is, where the state of California
may set up an inspection point for passing plant material

7
coming in from Arizona.

In a situation like that—-clearly,

they cant set up and have never tried to set up police offi­
cers to search people coming from Arizona to California.

But

they have had a very limited scope of authority, covered by
regulatory discretion, for health officials to examine matter
coming in»

And so there is a distinction in that vein between

a police officer and a customs type official.
QUESTION?
here.

Let me ask something about the fact

Is the appellant a United States citizen?
MR. REMCHOs

He is a United States citizen.

I am

not sure if the record reflects that fact? in fact, it does
not.
QUESTION;
MR. REMCHOs
QUESTION %

Where does he reside?
He resides in the state of Florida.
Mr. Remcho, you are arguing the Fourth

Amendment here, I take it.

Does the Fourth Amendment pleno,

:,o to speak, limit the authority of the Puerto Rican legisla­
ture?
MR. REMCHO;

The Fourth Amendment, in my view,

clearly limits the authority of the Puerto Ricar.. legislature,
that’s correct.

And I would say in any one of the four

rationalia that we set forth in our brief.
QUESTIONS

Either because it is analogous to a

state and the Fourth Amendment is incorporated by the Four­
teenth?

8
MR. REMCHQ

%

No, I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

I was persuaded by your dissent in Otero that, in passing
the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, clearly a distinc­
tion was made between a state and something which is not a
state, so I am not arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment, in
and of itself, carries the Fourth Amendment into Puerto Rico
in the traditional incorporation doctrine*
QUESTIONS

Well, you are on pretty thin ground if

you are persuaded by my dissent in Otero, since you presumably
have eight people versus one person.
MR. REMCHQx

Well, I am persuaded only by the

points that the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply directly
in the same fashion as if Puerto Rico were a state,
not saying that, that is what, does it.

I am

What I am saying is

that I take it the majority meant in that case was that, when
Congress,created this compact with the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico and said that all the constitutional provisions not
inapplicable will apply, that the Fourth Amendment applies in
that manner and through that, way,
S© that*s how it applies as a state.
it will apply as if it were a state*

Congress said

I don't believe the

opinion in Otero says anything other than it applies just
like the Fourteenth Amendment, not necessarily that it comes
directly from -this.
QUESTION:

So the Fourth Amendment prohibits

3
unreasonable searches *
MR. REMCHOs
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Now, I take it, in times of emergency,

a city or a particular area can declare a curfew that it
couldn't declare at other times without violating the Fourth
Amendment.
MR. REMCHOz

That would depend very much on the

fact-:, of the situation, but I can see that's possible®
QUESTION:

So supposing that the Puerto Rican le­

gislature here that decided that there was—and I gather from
the opinions of the three justices in the minority in the
Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, that there was a real crime
wave and a drug wave in Puerto Rico and that a great deal of
it was the result of people coming into Puerto Rico from the
United States—«do you think it is wholly beyond reason to
think that the Fourth Amendment would permit airport searches
of luggage where you don't have homes involved, where you can
perhaps stop all that traffic in one public area?
MR* REMCHO:

1 do think it's wholly unreasonable*

.1 think that in the first place there are absolutely no facts
offered by the government or in the legislative finding that
there is a danger from these guns which supports anything
oilier than a. generalised statement that there is a danger.
When I spoke ©f a curfew, I could sees that a narrow situation
when, perhaps, you know, there's an earthquake in San

10

Francisco—»you can impose a curfew.

But to say that you

could impose a curfew at any time because of an undifferen­
tiated generalised concern about the crime problem is to just
totally ignore the two centuries of Fourth Amendment juris­
prudence.
QUESTION:

You won on this issue? the Puerto Rican

Supreme Court agreed with you.
MR. REMCHOi
QUESTION s

That's correct.
And as I read the brief of your colleague

on the bottom side of this case* he doesn't dispute that de­
cision.
MR. REMCHOs
QUESTION:

I read it the same way.
So there's no issue between you on the

Fourth Amendment or on the ability to search*—or on the border
question.
MR. REMCHOs

I think that's probably correct.

If

iu feat this Court accepts the concession below,, as I hope
it will, I think that's correct®
QUESTION:

But then he says that leaves only the

issue which you want to argue about—that the failure of the
Court below to give you relief because of the 4-to-3 rial©,
or 'the majority rule, the super majority rule.
MR. REMCHOs

Well, if in fact he has conceded the

fourth Amendment issue, I don't care about the other issue,
because that decides this issue.

II
QUESTIONS

Well, I know, but I would ‘think you

would because there's a judgment outstanding against you®
QUESTIONS

We agree with you, and apparently ycur

colleague, about the Fourth Amendment issue®

Then, since we

don't have any such super majority rule here, we would simply
reverse the judgment, wouldn't we?
MR. REMCHOs
QUESTIONS
MR. REMCHOs

That's what I am asking.
Wouldn't it follow?
Yesf it wouldf that's what we are

asking.
QUESTION?

We would have to hold that it is uncon­

stitutional to have that super majority.
QUESTIONS
MR, REMCHOs

Why would we?
We do we have to hold that it's uncon-

otitutional—-why would you have to hold that it's unconsti­
tutional?
QUESTIONi

Is there not a judgment outstanding

against you now?
MR, REMCHOs

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Which is a characteristic of local law.

Can we direct another judgment to be entered by that Court,
unless w@ hold that that provision is unconstitutional?
MR. REMCHO:

I think you can.
Perhaps a federal habeas corpus court

can order release, because in that event there would be no

QUESTION?

Kell, they have already declared it,

but they say we have no power under our—under the Puerto
Rican law to reverse this judgment—we just don't have that
power*
MR. REMCHO?

I understand that.

They don't have

the power if it

is they who say that the statute is uncon­

stitutional $ if

this Court says

tutional, there

is nothing in tha Puerto Rico constitution

which prohibits

that Courtfrom

that the statute is unconsti­

entering judgment in favor

of appellant.
QUESTION?

You say the Akron against Bryant point

may well be an adequate state ground, but. the decision on
the merits of the Fourth Amendment question is not.
MR. REMCHOs

No, I am act saying that the Akron

versus Bryant may be an adequate state ground at all.

I am

saying that the decision in Akron is wrong—excuse me, that
the decision below, upholding that judgment, while they
thought the statute was not constitutional, is incorrect.

1

am saying you don't necessarily have to reach the issue of
whether Akron is wrong, because I think you can just go back
to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court with a declaration that that

14
statute is unconstitutional*
QUESTIONS

So you think the majority rule applies

to declarations of unconstitutionality?
MR. REMCHO;

That is what the statute»*“the const!"*

tutional provision says that that particular Court may not
hold the statute unconstitutional without that super majority.
If this Court holds it unconstitutional* that Court could
certainly enter judgment»
QUESTION?

Then it doesn't say that it may not

satisfy judgments for reasons of unconstifcutionality.
QUESTION?

Couldn't the Court have reversed the

judgment in this and not violated the statute?
MR. REMCHO:
QUESTION:
MR. REMCHO;
QUESTION;

Not violated Public Law 22?
Yes.
The Court's specific holding
Couldn't fell a Court by 4 to 3 say that

this judgment must be reversed, period?
QUESTION;

Without any reference to the Puerto Rico

statute.
MR* REMCHOs

I think there are two responses to

that.
QUESTION* They didn't think so.
MR. REMCHO;

Firstly, they didn't think so.

The

first thing is they clearly didn't think so, and they are
the one who interprets what that constitutional provision

15
means,
QUESTION s

Mid we are bound by that?

MR. REMCHO:

Yes, under this Court's decision, for

a narrow issue,

you are bound by the Puerto Rico Supreme

Court's interpretation of its own constitutional provision?
unless that interpretation is inescapably wrong.

And it

certainly is not inescapably wrong.
Secondly? 1 think ——

MR. REMCHOj

Thank you.

There’s no more controver­

sy over that than there would be after a court entered a
judgment or if any lawyer along the line gave up on that
issue.

If they give up on that issue, fine, let’s remand—

Court for —

sideration in light of this concession, that wouldn't change
the result,

if everybody stays far

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH SEMCHO, ESQ, , ON BEHAI,F
OF THE APPELLANT (resumed)
MR, REMCHQs

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please

&e Court, I want to make a few comments about what was raised
in the hearing before the lunch hour.
First* this Court is not bound by the concession of
the government®

In Sibron versus New York, for example, the

Kings County prosecutor conceded that that statute had been
violated, and this Court pointed out that concessions by the
parties do not relieve it from what it called the obligation
to perform the judicial function where matters of state constitutional—where federal constitutional rights in state
courts are decided.

And where this Court has already had the

benefit of full briefing and argument on that Fourth Amendment
claim* it seams to me that! the concession of the government
ought not t© bind this Court®
QUESTIONS

Well, that might be true when the lower

court happens to disagree, but it didn’t0
MR* REMCHOt

Well, the judgment of the lower court

is still in —
QUESTIONS

The only reason you lost in the lower

court was because of the local rule about upsetting a statute*

.18
MRe REMCHO*

Well, if Puerto Rico had a rule which

said that -»»QUESTION*

Isn’t that right?

They agreed with you

on the Fourth Amendment *
MR. REMCHOi
QUESTIONS
MR. REMCHO*

They did? that’s correct.
Four of them did.
Four of them did.

If Puerto Rico had

a rule that there is no appeal allowed at all from a decision
by a lower court, and the lower court had upheld the statute,
this Court would have full authority to decide that statute.
The fact that there is no appellate review at least—putting
aside the question of whether it's required—at least would
not toe considered an independent state ground to uphold the
judgment of the lower court.

And what’s happened is is that

the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has taken Article 5, Section
4, and said that that renders it powerless in a sense to
decide this appeal.

And if that’s true, it's no different,

than, if we directly hear from the judgment of the superior
court, which is the judgment in question.
QUESTION *

But it has decided the appeal? it's

affirmed that your client, as one of my colleagues pointed
out before, has a judgment of conviction outstanding against
him, so that whatever the voting rules are down there in San
Juan, you lost.
MR. REMCHOi

That's right, we lost, but we can

19
hardly be in a worse position than if we had no right to
appeal at all,
QUESTIONS

Yes,

MR, REMCHO;

I agree we lost, but that Court, in

affinning the judgment, was saying no more than it was not
going to rule on that appeal, even though it believed-*-the
majority believed—that the statute was unconstitutional,
QUESTIONS

Well| did it not rule on the appeal?

MR, REMCHO:

It affirmed the judgment, but on the

grounds it was powerless to do otherwise, and that's no dif­
ferent than if there were no appeal at all.
QUESTIONS

Is that quite an accurate description of

If we say that the local rule of what you call, I think,

QUESTIONi

How can you call that procedural?

QUESTION:

On the habeus corpus issue*, under Stone

against Powell, is habeus corpus available'?
MR, REMCHOz

I think that's an open question.

Either it is not available, because it was a full and fair
hearing in the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, or if there was not
afull and fair hearing in the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, it
seems to me we should prevail under due process.

So I would

say that habeus is only available if we have that full and
fair hearing.

If the Court says that ultimately -it will not

entertain a habeus corpus and if the Puerto Rico Supreme
Court on remand says that it is still powerless to enter the
ju.dc.';,r:ntt then in fact this statute, Public Law 22, will re-

ORAL ARGfIMBHT OF ROBERTO ARMSTRONG. JR.
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR* ARMSTRONG*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.

1 believe that the main issue before this Court is
whether the appellant properly raised before the Supreme Court
of.Puerto Rico the issue that there was a conflict between
federal law end the non-reversal of the conviction on account
of the Puerto Rican constitutional section that binds
only to decisions based on local rules.

In this case, the

four judges who have decided in favor of reversal»*—they have
decided only on local grounds; they decided on Fourth Amend-

Tr mt and local Article 10 rights.
There is no question in ray mind -that under the
Ohio versus Akron Park decision the more-than~simpl'e-ma jorifcy
requirement for wiping out local statutes is reasonable.
as

So

far ar the local law is concerned, I believe that the

decision is final and there is nothing more to argue on it,
©&1 nothing that can be brought to this Court,

It was

In other words, the Supreme

In fact, I would add something

QUESTION»
•chi- -:

Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong, are you saying

that within the ten days after this decision came down

iv the Suprema Court, he should have applied or should have
mad-;: an allegation, petition for rehearing or whatever it
tee, that as applied to a case where four thought the
federal question, the constitutional question, should be
decided in favor of the accused, that not therefore to re~
verse the Judgment of conviction somehow violated some
provision of the federal constitution, is that it?
ME* ARMSTRONGS
QUESTION?

Correct, your honor.

Now, what provision of the federal

27
constitution would you say he b id to assert, had been violafeed by not. reversing the conviction?
MR* ARMSTRONG:

I would say that there is a federal

ground for reversal,
QUESTION:

What is it?

MR, ARMSTRONGS

The federal ground was the problem

of reasonableness of the search —
QUESTION:

I*a sorry, I didn*t catch that,

MS, ARMSTRONG:

The problem of reasonableness of

the seizure, of the search where the evidence was seized.
That was what the four judges found to be in conflict*
QUESTIONs

Well, I know, but I thought what you

told me was that what he should have done was file a petition
for rehearing,
MR. ARMSTRONG:
QUESTION:

Right.

And say they 'could not apply the state

constitutional provision reaairing /j-five votes because this
•i federal constitutional determination by four .that the
■a:tube was unconstitutional.
MR, ARMSTRONG:
QUESTION:

On federal grounds,

On federal grounds—and, therefore, that,

they could not affirm the judgment of conviction under the
to Rican constitutional provision but had to reverse it.
What's the federal ground for that claim?
MR. ARMSTRONG%

The Supremacy Clause.

23
QUESTION:

The Supremacy Glaus©.

MR. ARMSTRONGS

We considered that the judges were

bound by the Supremacy Clause which says that they shall rule
in the federal law notwithstanding any provision in the con­
stitution or the laws of the state to the contrary.

If the

man had a 4-to-3 acquittal on federal grounds--on federal
grounds that was enough for acquittal, but the point was
that that issue was never raised—the Supreme Court of Puerto
Rico never had an opportunity to decide on that issue.

And

that is why we believe that remand is not the proper remedy
here.

I believe that this is dismissal, because there is no

federal issue properly raised? there is no federal question
before this Court.
QUESTION:

Therefore, you say, the appeal should be

dismissed?
MR. ARMSTRONG:
QUESTION*

The appeal should be —

The appeal to this Court should be dis-

■ ;dssed.
MR* ARMSTRONG:
a.

Yes, the appeal to this Court

’.ianifjsed, probably, as—there may be» of course,;

\id bvi

reasonable

grounds for federal habeas, because vs have ©~3

that 4'-to®3 decision there.
But as far as this appeal, the Supremo Court of
Puerto Rico has not passed on the question that' is brought
to this Court at this time.

29
So until the Court decides whether or not that ab­
solute majority principle is binding in all cases and with
all laws, whether federal or commonwealth, I believe the
Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has not entered a decision with
the federal question sufficiently substantial to come before
this Court*

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH REMCHO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. REMCHO:

Thank you.

With respect to the

timely raising of the petition, Rule 45(4) of the Rules of
the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico says that if you file a
petition beyond the ten-day period, then that will not be
granted unless it will have no effect—will not be acted on
unless it has no effect on the mandate.

And, in fact, this

late petition was acted on by the Supreme Court of Puerto
Ri‘.:o.

They didn't say they were denying it as. untimely.

They met en. banc and they acted on that late petition.
I am also not certain that there are eJhy decisions

QUESTION:
MR. REMCHO:
QUESTION:

And denied it.
And denied it, that's correo::.
And you presented the claim that this

constitutional provision was invalid under the federal con­
stitution?
MR. REMCHOs

That’s correct.

on the due process clause, and we pointed out —

MR, REMCHOs

Yes, it is? it is reprinted in the

have the relevant sections, where it was raised on due pro­
cess and also this dumber as to Powell grounds,
And, of course, that carries with it the Supremacy
'Clause grounds—“for example, in Chapman

versus California,

the basis for decision there obviously is one of the suprema­
cy of federal rights over local constitutional, procedures,

MR. REMCHOs

We don't know that.

We do knew than

•there is an appeal procedure which suggests 'that the dark
should not file one which is out of time.

And it may vary

well be that the Court directed the clerk to file this one,
fully considered it and denied it at the time on the merrts«

But I think the inference is that it was heard on
the merits, heard en banc»
QUESTION:

Why is that the inference?

not to be filed if it is late by the clerk.

39
MR. REMCHGs
QUESTION*

That5s correct.
Is that the least bit inconsistent with

the Ohio case?
MR. REMCHOs

I think that there is a certain incon­

sistency there, but the Ohio case is, first off, 48 years of
due process ago.
QUESTION:

And so you would really say that we

should really upset the Ohio case?
MR. REMCHO;

1 don*t think it's necessary, because

Ohio had two things this case doesn’t;

first, it was a civil

case? and, second, there was already intermediate full appel­
late review in the Ohio court.

So that case can certainly

be distinguished.
QUESTION:

Well, several years ago this Court up­

held a sixty percent majority requirement for bond approval
in West Virginia.
MR. REMCHO':

Well, I think that bond approval mat-

ts:and those »?orts of civil matters, have historically been
■treated very, very differently for the enforcement of federal
t son-.

t.i tutional rights.
