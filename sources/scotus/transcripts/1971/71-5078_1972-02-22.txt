Mro Garland, you may proceed whenever you’re ready..
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD T. M. GARLAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GARLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The case before you comes on a simple record, in that
it comes simply predicated upon the filing of a federal habeas
■corpus petition.
by the court.

There was no hearing. Arid then it was dismiss-.-u

An appeal was taken to the Fifth Circuit, stating

denial of equal protection of the law and due process of lav/,
as it related to the claims in the petition.
Those same claims were in the petition for habeas
corpus, and they related to the systematic exclusion of blacks
from the grand jury and the petit jury, all of which were taken
from the same list, the grand jurors and the petit jurors.
That claim was urged in the Circuit Court, and was
urged both on the basis of equal protection and due process in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is from the denial in the Fifth Circuit Court —
Q

Did you present both grounds to the Court of

Appeals?
GARLANDS

Yes, sir

4
Q

I see they’re both in your petition for habeas

corpus.
MR. GARLANDs
Q

Yes, sir.

And you presented both arguments to the Court of

Appeals?
MR. GARLANDs Both equal protection and due process of
law.
Q

And they responded to just one?

MR. GARLAND:
that it was both.

No, sir, they did not.

The language said:

They stated

Petitioner claims a

violation of equal protection and due process.

That was the

language of the
Q

Of the opinion?

MR. GARLAND:

— of the court's decision, and them it

went on to discuss the question of waiver, and then finally
said that there was no denial of equal protection; but it was
acknowledged that we had raised both issues, in the preparatory
paragraphs, the first paragraphs of the opinion.
Q

This is the most recent opinion of the Court of

Appeals?
MR. GARLAND:
0

Yes, Your Honor.

Is that the opinion at page 20 of the record,

Mr. Garland?
Q

Well, whether they dealt with it or not,

expressly, you presented it to them?

5
ft-:;.,

s

Yes, we did. . And I believe it is in

the opinion, Your Honor.
Q

ftellF it either is or it isn't, but —

MR. GARLANDS
Q

— you did present the issue —

MS. GARLANDs
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, we did.

-- on both equal protection and due process?

MR. GARLAND?

It was in the brief that accompanied

the petition in the District Court as well as the briefs in
the Circuit Court, and by act of counsel, obviously, we didn't
state it adequately in our question in the petition for
certiorari, we feel that both concepts are before the Court
since it was a matter of the law, and that it was —
Q

Wall, your first question in your petition was

simply to just say, to stand there.
MR. GARLANDs That's right.
Q

I assume that what you're saying is that you

argued standing from two vantage points?
MR. GARLAND?

That is correct, Your Honor, and we

feel that it is before this Court for consideration, based or
the record in the case.
As to the question that we did not mention the petit
jury in —
Q

What would this — tell me more precisely what,

your due process ground is.

Is it historic fairness, or is it

6
the Sixth Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth?
MR. GARLAND:

It. ?s not — X wouldn’t say it is

exactly historical background of it.

It is the Sixth Amendment

as incorporated by the Fourteenth, the concept of Duncan ? but
it. is also that that is a fundamental concept in the adRiinistra­
tion of justice in this country,
And that basically the due process therefore require:;,,
it.
Q

You’re saying the concept of a jury necessarily

includes a cross-section, is that what you’re arguing?
MR, GARLMfDs

Yes, sir.

So we feel that based upon

the present determination of what a jury is and what it amount*.to under the law in the United States and in Georgia? that if
necessarily comprises the concept of the representative basis?
the democratic concept of the jury.
Q

Well? tell me how a white man is denied equal

protection of the law by the exclusion of Negroes.
MR. GARLAND; Well, he is denied equal protection, to
the extent that there are different juries that would judge
him, or that his case is affected byj to that extent now,
exactly what the perimeters of that are, it's hard to^say,
Q

All right, then.

MR. GARLAND §
Q

And it may be that there is —

Well, I know, but that doesn’t distinguish him

from anybody else.

7
MR. GARLAtt:

Well, it may give him a different

quality of justice.

Q

Are you sajlng that a Negro would have the right

to have Negroes .included on the jury and be closer to a fair
cross-section than a white man on trial?
MR. GARLAND?
Q

Yes, this is ~

Is that your argument?

MR.. GARLAND?

Yes.

And the effect of that, of

course, is that a black could very well, under the same
indictment that a white — returned by the same grand jury,
might well file his attack upon the composition of the grand
jury, and if it were overruled he'd have a chance to get an
acquittal, but if he didn't he could appeal on that basis,
assuming the trial court erred.

Whereas the white man could

not do that.
Nov;, somehow that presents an unequal system.
Q

Well, I suppose — it sounds like you're arguing,

at least parti;;, that every one's entitled to a jury with a fair
cross-section in it, and —
MR. GARLANDS
Q

That is —

— and if you deny it to anybody, you're being

discriminated against?
MR. GARLAND? That is the essence of the argument, and
to a great extent the extent of the argument.
Q

It —

What is the spread between Presbyterians, Baptist

8
Methodists, Lutheranst and other religious groups on these
juries?
ME. GARLAND s
in our State, but
Q

1

J.

am uninformed upon any statistics

--

Wouldn’t that --

MR. GARLANDs

—- based on exn

•• -ance and. outside the

record, I would say that we have a representative cross-section
of the various religious groups on'our juries.
Q
claim?

Welle if you didn't, would you be making the same

Suppose Methodists or Baptists turned out to be dis­

proportionately represented, would you say that was a denial
of this perfectly balanced jury?
MR. GARLAND?

I would say in theory, yes.

For the

purposes of this case, the Court would not have to go that
far.

And of course you would first have to reach the question

of whether they were an identifiable class and whether or not
that left — I don't think you can go into the question of the
extent of a particular prejudice.

I would say yes, that if

there was an identifiable segment of the community, and those
were excluded, that the concept of the — that the fundamental
concept of a jury would require that.
It should be able to do that.
Q

In Georgia, do they record on the jury wheels or

rolls the religious affiliation of persons who'might be called?
MR. GARLANDs

No, they do not.

Now, they do send —

s
thsy hav>.;

Off-' :"8.

ho, you cannot get that information in the Clerk21
Xt#s not available to counsel.
Sow, perhaps at the time of the compilation of the

voter registration list, from which our juries are now selectee,
there could foe some information on it? but I*m not familiar
with it, Your Honor*
Q

Mr. Garland, does the Georgia Constitution

require jury trial in criminal cases?
MR. GARLAND:

It. provides for jury trial in criminal

cases, Your Honor, and of course the defendant may waive it,
in all criminal cases, both misdemeanor and felony.
In considering this issue, of course I think the Cviv..recognizes that the black man,acknowledged that he can complain.,
and the State seems to rely on some concept of prejudice as
needing to be shown.
It is the position of the petitioner that in fact
there is prejudice to the petitioner, and that that prejudice
comes from the essence of the requirement of the- jury, what
the jury means.

I think this Court has talked about the value

of the cross-section in Duncan vs. Louisiana, and has talked
about it in Williams vs. Florida.

And I think there the fact

that there must be between the government and the defendant
the voice of the people has been recognized.
I submit to you that one of the considerations should
be that it is the voice of all of the people.

10
Mow, haw there is prejudice is a more speculative
matter.

3

speculative in that you have to analyse what a

jury trial, in fact amounts to and how the minds of respective
jurors work*

But I would suggest to the Court that in fact

there is prejudice when the broad base of the jury is destroyed
in this respect.

The jury stands as the barrier against the

various vices that can occur in a jury trial.
Mow, those may be improper acts or conduct by a
prosecutor# hopefully not# but improper acts or biased acts
by a judge# or improper acts by a juror# particular juror,
such as someone attempting to influence the jury.

In addition to those factors that the jury stands as
a buffer between# there is the question of the nature of the
crime and how that particular crime affects a particular
jury# or the standing of the defendant# his particular status
in reference to the community that is about to try him# or
the status of the victim# or the status of the witnesses.
The concept# X submit to you, that the defendant in
fact is' prejudiced is that aa to those possible violations and
those possible acts that depart from what we say is the right
to a fair jury# that the broader the base the more likelihood
there is that there will not be the influence of. any of those
things to such an extent as to deny the fairness of trial.
So X think the very concept of what the provision for trial
by jury means is that we try to strive toward the system that

11
will get us the fairest possible result.
So we say that —
Q

“She fairest possible result or the fairest

possible jury?
MR. GARLAND: Well* I would say ...fairest jury v

And the

result being that if you have a fair jury* that is the result
you seek,, that that is the closest you can come to justice.
Mow* we're not talking about from the standpoint of what one
side or the other wants in a jury* Your Honor* but it's as to
those things* the broad base amounts to insurance in reference
to the ability of the jury to withstand any number of unfair
prejudices.
So it *«? to that very basis that 1 submit to you that
the concept that seems to have been the basis for the opinion
below that there was no prejudice to this man is in — or to
a white parson complaining of exclusion of blacks — is in error ,
that there in fact is a prejudice.
And of course* in speaking of the language that has
been used by the courts* there is a narrowing of attitudes,
soma of the distinct flavor of the jury is lost, and you can
also consider, of course* that the whole is different from the
parts.
Q

Mr. Garland* how broad does the jury have to fea?

MR. GARLANDs Well* as broad.as the fabric of the
society from which it is selected, Your Honor, and hopefully

12
that would include all of the eligible citizenry.
Q

Well, how do you get that?

MR, GARLAND;

Hopefully, we can get that by the Court

sustaining our position here,
Q

Well, how can you get a real cross-section of the

jury when the prosecution is busily engaged in not getting a
fair jury but a pro-prosecution jury, and the defense counsel
is not interested in getting a fair jury but getting a prodefendant

ary: how do you get that big cross-section?
MR, GARLAND;

Well, if you have — we select our

juries by the process of rejection.

And if the prosecution, in

rejecting those that lie doesn't feel will go his way, and the
defense is objecting to the ones that look most prosecution *—
Q

Well, I mean, how many different areas,

different types, different groups, do you need in the big jury
box, the wheel?
MR. GARLAND; Well, 1 couldn't name a number, of
course, but 1 think we need all of the identifiable groups
in the community that exist, and who are — who meet the
other qualifications, and that those qualifications are -Q

Well, what do you need other than all of the

racial groups?
MR. GARLAND*

Wall, the economic groups, any —

the religious groups, if they fall into —
Q

Well, you didn't object to that, did you?

13
The only thing you object to is the racial thing*
MR. GARLAND°
here,

That's the only thing X*m objecting to

in theory, I would object further, yes, sir.
h

Yes, but your basis for that is that you have

this broad base you need*

And you only complain because no

Negro was considered.
MR. GARLAND: That was the only one we .knew in advance
that in fact we could prove without difficulty, because the
jury list had been selected in the same method that had been
declared to be invalid previously.

And we saw — we have never

had a chance to present proof in this case in the record, it*s
twice been filed and there's never been any evidentiary hearing.
So there’s no sense, from our standpoint, no sense carrying a
greater burden under the allegations than we needed.
rather clear that there was a disparity.

It was

The previous jury-

list selected by the same process was 14 percent black, 86
percent white, and the percentages were substantially different.
Q

Well, your position is, you're not arguing so
l

much about who should be in. there, but you want to be sure
nobody is kept out? is that your position?
MR. GARLAND:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And 1 submit this
Q

MR. GARLAND: That is correct.

where it would be logical for counsel on one.side or the other
to see the implication of a white man being damaged by the
actions of blacks in rather clear terms, rather than the - terms
that I have expressed here, as it relates to tl
protections.
But it’s common that a white defendant may roly upon
black witnesses, or it's common that he may have close
identification, by many means, with a black; but that should
not be the standing.

If it is, we get into'.an interminable

question of when does prejudice exist?
prejudice?

Where do you find this

And how do you determine it?
And that will open up a scop® for litigation that's

that requires, even in a case where a Negro defendant is on
trial in the State court, there * s nothing in the Constitution
that requires that either the grand or the petit jury have on
it any Negro.

That's correct, isn't it?

MR* GARLANDS

Yes, Your Honor.

15
Q

The only constitutional requirement is that then*

be a non-discriminatory system of jury selection.

You agree

with that6 -don't you?
MR, GARLAND; And that it be a representative cross™
section,
Q

The system,

Sot that any particular jury be —

MR. GARLANDt Right.
Q

representative cross-section?

MR, GARLAND %

The system that that jury be drawn in

the representative cross-section.
Q

That the system be one designed to get a

representative cross-section.
MR. GARLAND;
Q

You agree with that?

MR. GARLAND:
Q

Yes.

Yes.

And that it’s been explicitly held that there’s

no requirement even, as I say» in the case of a Negro defendant
that there be any Negroes at all on his jury.

You would agree

with that, wouldn't you?
MR. GARLAND:
Q

Yes, I would.

And yet a defendant has been allowed to attack

a system, even in the light of those holdings. And wouldn't
it then be possible to argue your ease in quite a different way
from the way you've argued it to date? and that is along these
lines, that this is one of the very few cases? perhaps, one of

IS
the very few .situations where this Court, going way back to

Strauder

West Virginia» back in 1879» and those early casas

under the Fourteenth Amendment, this is one of the few cases

where a court has allowed somebody who cannot actually show
prejudice in his case to represent the rights of other people»
i.e.', Negroes in the community, to serve cm a jury.

And

that right was established way back in the X9th Century and
was reaffirmed as recently as a year or two ago in the Carter
case in this Court, and the companion case, in which we
allowed Negroes themselves to sue to serve on a jury.
Not that your client was denied equal protection, not
that your client was denied due process, but you’re representing
your client is representing the rights of Negroes in the
community for an opportunity for citizen service on grand and
petit juries.
Wouldn't it be possible to argue your case along
those lines?
HR. GARLAND:

It certainly would be possible for this

Court to take that position and to add that to the argument
which we'make.

And that — and as that was pointed out by the

amicus in this case.
I think this Court can decide the decision in our
favor without having to do that and declare that.

X think the

Court should declare that.
q

we13» the point is the Court could, if there is

17
any merit iri that position — if there is .merit in. that position,
Feuld d-aside the case in your favor without any- .finding of
prejudice to your client whatsoever.

MR. GARLAND:

It certainly could, Your Honor.

And

1 think the Court should do it on both bases, on the basis
pointed out by the amicus is certainly a good one to do it on.
However, I think the Court can also say that it would stand
either ways

that we find in fact when you deny the cross-

section, there is. a prejudice? however, you don’t have to find

the prejudice, because he has the right to enforce a fair
system.
Q

You didn't bring this action as a class action,

however, did you?
MR. GARLAND:

No, I did not.

One individual client.

I think that — X wish to mention the case of Faye vtNew York is not against the petition of the position that we
assert here.

In that case there was a failure of proof on the

allegations that were made by the petitioner? that case also
was decided before Duncan vs. Louisianaf and perhaps the Court
would have viewed the problem a little differently at that
stage, and the Court in Faye did not reach the issue of the
requirement of identity in that case.
So we submit that Faye is not against us, and of course
would call the Court4s attention to the logic and language of
Justice Murphy in his dissent in that case.

18
q

Mr. Garland, you argue in your brief and mentioned

at the outset of your argument here that retroactivity is an
important point in this ease.

I wish you would state for my

'benefit to what extent your case depends on retroactivity.
MR, GARLANDs

I don't believe my case depends, the

petitioner's claim depends on retroactive application.

I do

think, though, that retroactive application is very much
needed in reference to a matter of this nature to avoid the
type of process that this particular petitioner has gone through
in the courts, raising the issue, going up, coming back, going
back in.
Q

If this is not a class action, and if vour own

client's rights do not depend on retroactivity, why do you
press it?
MR„ GARLANDS So that w® can have a simple decision
that's workable in our State courts.

So we won't go through

the process of man waiting in jail while we go to our State
courts t© determine the question of retroactivity and then g©
into Federal court to again wait to find out what happens.
1 think that it will do, it will relieve some of the burden
on the Federal system if there is aclear pronunciation and
it's dealt with, and 1 would see nothing to prohibit this
Court from dealing with that issue®
q

it means every man in this county is released.

every whit© man?

19
MR. GARLAND:

Well* as a practical effect* most of

those people — this is outside the record* because I do&'t
have the statistics. But since the jury was allegedly corrected
in 196?* in March of that year* most of those people that
would be affected by this would have already been released from
the present system —
Q
released?

But those that wars still there would be

That's what you want?
MR. GARLAND:
Q

Yes.

That is correct.

Well* what about the Negroes?

MR, GARLAND: They would be released also.
Q

How could they in this case?

MR. GARLAND:
they would be released.

If they haven't asserted their rights*
They should have asserted their

rights* or someone should have asserted them for them.
Q

Well* Whitns wasn’t made retroactive* was it?

MR. GARLAND;
Q

Was it?

MR. GARLAND:
Q

I think the effect of it is ~

— in Georgia.

Was it made retroactive?

MR. GARLAND:

It's been applied retroactively in

Georgia, ted I don't know the answer to the question.
But it has been applied retroactively.
2 ask the Court to consider, in reference to this*

the possibility that could occur if there are juries in the

20

State of Georgia and other States that are invalidly composed,
and l would suggest to the Court that this type discrimination
does still in fact exist, and does occur.
X wish to give illustration outside the record.
Shortly before c „aing here, three weeks ago, in a town some
60 miles south of Atlanta, the Superior Court judge declared
invalid the jury list upon an application by a black in a rape
case.
In response to that, the three white jury commissioners
resigned in. protest.

Now, that issue had not been raised, had

not been pursued in that court until 1972.
What the reason for that is is that in your rural
areas where, if there is this type discrimination that carries
over into the system, the lawyers generally are few, are
engaged in a more local practice.
questions in the court.

They fight the evidentiary

But it's not as likely that the

constitutional concepts are litigated or are fought and it’s
brought out.
Bo the fact that there will be a beneficial effect to
this type decision is illustrated by the fact that these
prejudices can in fact occur and continue even though the
system that was used in this particular case has been rejected.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: All right, Mr. Garland.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MRS. BEASLEYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Peters is in the extraordinary position of asking that
his conviction and his sentence be set aside, and his lndietm« u
voided, because he was favored by the .jury selection system.
And ha does jo as se afterthought, after his second trial and

appeal to Georgia appellate courts.
He didn't raise the complaint at all in the State
courtso
What happened actually is that the history of this
whole case is a piggyback affair, if I may use that colloquial
ism.
He wants to avoid his burglary conviction, which was
had in 1966, by claiming the rights of Negroes, without
alleging any harm to him.

.As 1 said, he never complained of

the jury composition in the State courts.
Q

Are you urging this as a deliberate bypass, or

what?
MRS. BEASLEY?

Ho, I *m not, because we did not

take a cross-appeal from the decision of the Fifth Circuit that
he did not have to exhaust -0

Are you suggesting that Faye v, Nois wouldn't

permit raising it on habeas corpus?

Ho, not at all? although one of the

thought should have bean sustained, was sustai

Court, and that the Supreme — that the Fifth Circuit ruled on
the merits of the claim, was that he should have exhausted his
State remedies*
Q

Are you urging, that there hasn't been exhaustion.,

contrary to the decision of the Fifth Circuit?
MRS. BEASLEYs

Yes, we certainly are. But since we

did not take a cross-appeal I regard that more or less as a
peripheral matter.
q

well, why aren't you entitled to sustain the

judgment below on any ground that yon want to, even if it was
rejected?
MRS. BEASLEY: We think that there is a more funda­
mental question here, and of course we ware brought to this
Court as the respondent, on a grant of petition for certiorari.
Q

So, are you urging us to hold that he didn’t

exhaust State remedies or not?
MRS. BEASLEY:

No", sir? I don't think that's

necessary, Mr* Justice White, because I think there•s a much
more fundamental issue here, which the Court can rule on and
which was ruled on at the District Court level, and by the
Fifth Circuit? and that is that there is no claim stated by
the petitioner upon which relief can be granted, because he

Ee3s claiming somebody else3 s right.
Q

So you accept the Court of Appeals decision

that there was exhaustion?
MRS, BEASLEY; For the purpose of this appeal, that's
correct.

Although the reasons that they said the exhaustion

was not necessary we believe were wrong, because we don't
think that

Well, doesn't there have to —

Mo, .’sir? only in answer to your

We don't -Q

Well, there still must be compliance with the

statute.
MRS. BEASLEY; That's correct. But I think the answer
that was given in going to the merits itself is what this Court
can rule on, so that the matter doss not need to come up again.

24
Q

Wall, but if that was — whether the parties

raised it or not, I suppose we could notice a plain error,
MRS» BEASLEY;
Q

Yes, indeed, you could.

You don't mean to say you're abandoning the

possible support of the judgment below by reason of -MRS. BEASLEYS

Oh, not at all, because I think the

very basic, the fact that they moved on to the question, and
so did the District Court? the District Court held, in answer
to our motion to dismiss, which was on three bases, the
second one being that he had not exhausted, and the third one
being beyond that that he had no cause of action.

The District

Court held in conformity with the position taken by the
respondent that he did not exhaust his State remedies, but
even if he had, there is no cause of action? taking the view
that even if he had got to the State courts, the result would
have been the same, because

he alleged no violation of a

Federal constitutional right.
So it foreclosed the necessity of going back and
forth to reach the same result, when it could be reached right
in the District Court without a hearing.
Q

And the second — the Court of Appeals rejected

the second ground for dismissal?
MRS. BEASLEY?
Q

That's correct.

And said there had been exhaustion —

MRS. BEASLEY;

Yes.

25
Q

and compliance with the statute.

MRS. BEASLEYs
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice —

It said they wouldn't require hint to do a useless

act. <
MRS. BEASLEYS

That's correct.

Right.

And —
Q

You5 re saying that8 s wrong?

MRS. BEASLEY: We’re saying that’s- wrong because of
the reasons given, that he was foreclosed from raising the
issue in the Georgia courts, and that is incorrect;, as a matter
of fact.

But that’s neither here nor there when you get down'

to the cause of action.
And, as a matter of fact, that very fact that he
relied so heavily on the exhaustion as giving him — and
that’s what the standing issue came in, as a matter of fact?
he said he had standing because he had — didn’t have to
exhaust, he hM a justification for non-exhaustion, so he had
standing to come into court. And that’s how that issue got in,
although, of course, we never challenged the standing to raise
the question.
What we’re, saying is that there is no constitutional
right in the first place, not that you’re not the proper party
to raise it.
But I think the fact the exhaustion question is
important, because it illustrates that he did not p»—*sue the

26
due process claim in the courts below, and this is in answer to
a. question that Mr, Justice White asked appellant’s counsel,
and I think it's very important to recognise that, because this:
whole thing arose as an equal protection claim.

The petitioner ,

in his petition, in the court below — in the District Court,
talked in terms of systematic exclusion and Fourteenth
Amendment and equal protection, and just briefly mentioned the
words "due process”.

And we don't think that that raises the

due process argument.
And he says?

X don't have to go to the Georgia

Supreme Court because they've already ruled that X can't raise
the systematic exclusion issue.

And systematic exclusion has

always been regarded as an equal protection concept.

This

Court said so in Whites, and in the cases preceding it.

It's

in terms of an equal protection concept that we look at the
systematic exclusion allegation.
And by him now coming, at this point, and saying?
Well, now X want to pursue this idea of dud process, which X
just mention the two words, in the court below and in the
District Court? 1 don't think he has raised that properly.
Because he didn't argue' it in the court below, and that's
exactly what he used as the basis for not going through the
;

Georgia State courts.
So it indicates to me that he didn't intend to raise
tha due process argument, because he there states he has a

26-k
new right which has never been recognised before, which is a
right to a representative cross-section of the community,
period.
3e eliminates the part that makes it a due — makes
it an equal protection claim, which is a right to a representa­
tive cross-section of the community from which members of his
race were not excluded.

And that’s the concept that —

that8s the context in which that phrase has been used in all of
the cases that I have been able to find since Strauder.
And, as a matter of fact? I think that the context
is relevant in the Smith case in 1900 — or rather 1940.
Q

Mrs. Beasley, what do you say to the point that

he is entitled to a jury from which no discernible group is
/

systematically excluded?

i

i

MRS. BEASLEY: But he doesn't tie that in at all -4
Q

Do you think he is entitled to that?

MRS. BEASLEY:
yes.

If it affects the fairness of his trial
/

0

Well-, you don't think as .a general principle

that he has the right to a jury from which no discernible group
is systematically ®: eluded?
MRS. BEASLEY: As an abstract principle, I think that * t
correct.

But I think fbr him to assert that and say that his

trial should be avoided. —
Q

Well, would it be all right if it excluded all

wage -“earners ?
MRS. BEASLEYs

It may very well be so, 'if it didn't

affect his case,
Q

That would be all right?

MRS. BEASLEY;

It wouldn’t be under the statutory

scheme, nor would it be correct as a —
Q

1'm talking about the Constitution —

MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

-- system.

I'm talking about the constitutional scheme.

MRS. BEASLEY;

Mr,, Justice Marshall, it would not be

correct in terms of the constitutional requirements.
Q

I should think not.

MRS. BEASLEY:
0

But it wouldn’t affect him.

He'd have no standing if all wage-earners were

excluded systematically,

If he were the president of a bank,

he would — or even the owner of the bank, and without a wage,
just a capitalist, he would have no standing.

That’s your

point, isn’t it?
MRS. BEASLEY;

Yes, sir.

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart,

it would be.
Q

Even though it would be abstractly unconstitu­

tional,
MRS. BEASLEY;

Which gets to the, I think, to the

point that —
Q

to systematically exclude all white persons.

ae
••4E3. BEASLEY:

—- that you were making in your

questioning of ,the appellant’s counsel — petitioner's counsel?
that he couldn't be representing the interests of anybody else
in the posture of this case, because this is a habeas corpus
case in which h@*s saying "my conviction and my indictment are
bad, and X*m looking for relief to myself, because I didn't
have an impartial jury.B
And he specifically said here that that's what he's
relying on is his Sixth Amendment right brought into the due
process clause.
Q

This really is a standing case, isn't it? that's

what it comes down to?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Isn't that right?
Mo, I don't think so.

I think it’s

much more fundamental than that.
Q

Why?

MRS. BEASLEY:

If it were a standing case, then 1'

think we might be in position to say that the right belongs to
somebody but he's not the right person to come forward and -Q
it?

But the right does belong to somebody, doesn't

Isn't that what •—
MRS. BEASLEY:

The right which he is talking about

here, which is the right not to have Negroes excluded from —
Q

That's right, and that belongs to somebody, and

that's what the Carter case and the Turner case, of two terms
ago,

29
MRS.» BEASLEY:
Q

Right.

— absolutely establishes? isn’t that correct?

MRS. BEASLEY:

Yes, sir.

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart,

it belongs to those who would be deprived'of a right thereby,
or who would be discriminated against thereby.
Q

The right to serve on juries.

MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

That's correct.

Right?

MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

So then ~

Q

. And that's

That's Turner.

also Carter?

MRS. BEASLEY: That’s
Q

also Carter.

So then if two people, a black man and a — a

Negro and a white man were both charged with robbery, of the
same robbery, and they are tried by the same jury, the Negro
has got a good point but the white man hasn't?
Q

Right.

MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

Why?

That’s right, because he presumes —

Why?

MRS. BEASLEY:

We have presumed that there is

prejudice against the black man if members of his race are
excluded from the jury selection system, and that he is thereby
discriminated against —
Q

Is that, therefore, a bad jury?

MRS. BEASLEY: As to him?

It. is.

30
Q

Ho.

Is that, therefore, —

MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

It is not a void jury.

Well, but he's the only one who can raise the

point?
MRS. BEASLEY;
the point.

But he’s the only one that can raise

Because the constitutional claim —
Q

Unfortunately, I’m sure you can’t cite me such a

case.
MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

No, sir.

Well, Mrs. Beasley, let’s assume that the

defendant here was a Negro, and he raised only the due process
claim.

He says;

I'm not claiming a denial of equal protection

at all; I’m claiming a strictly Sixth Amendment due process,
namely, I'm entitled to be tried by a jury representative of
the community.
He says;

I don't want any decision about, equal

protection, X think that — I just don’t believe in that
equal protection rationale.
And I take it, a while ago, you said that you didn't
disagree with that fundamental constitutional argument about a
jury.
MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

X don’t.

The Sixth ~

All right, would you sustain his claim there

on strictly due process Sixth Amendment grounds?
MRS. BEASLEY;

I think I would, because it gets so

31
close, and 1 think this Court has said so in at least one or
two cases that equal protection melds with due process —
Q

Well, we just forget — we just forget equal

protection for a moment,
MRS. BEASLEY: All right.
Q

And he argues straight Fourteenth Amendment

due process, and incorporation of the Sixth Amendment as binding
oh the States, and he says the concept of a jury requires no
substantial group in the community be systematically excluded,
or 1 do not have the kind of a jury I'm entitled to.
MRS.BEASLEY:

I think that he would indeed be

sustained, for this reason?

If he is claiming due process has

been denied to him means he has suffered some harm, he has not
had a fair trial? is the concept.
Q

Well, he says that:

And he —
I can’t really say, I can't

show any specific prejudice in my casp, but I am entitled to a
-- to be tried by a jury that is fairly representative of the
conscience of the community.

And he cites Witherspoon and a

few other casas, and Ballard, and you would sustain that claim
on strictly due process grounds, wholly aside from equal
protection?
MRS. BEASLEY:

If what he was saying was that he -was

denied a fair trial, that he was denied an impartial jury, -~
Q

Well, he says —-

MRS. BEASLEY:

— because Negroes were systematically

32
■ people of his own race ■

sfcematically excluded,

sn, <msP you would have to sustain it
an impartial jury.
Q

. ise ha did not have

We are —

So you9 re saying

MRS. BEASLEY:

— we presume the prejudice in those

cases.
Q

Ail right.

You’re saying that the>cross-section

requirement for a jury must be tied to the possibility of
partiality or prejudice?
MRS. BEASLEY *

Yes.

Either it has to be something

■that w© had presumed, which we have done# and I don’t want to
belabor the point presumed, but we presumed in the case of
exclusion of race.
Q

S thought that that went out of the case in our

decision in Faye va. New York.
actual prejudice there.

There’s no showing of prejudice,

This was a case of the blue-ribbon

jury, you remember?
MRS. BEASLEYj
Q

Yes, sir®

Yes, Mr. Justice Douglas.

Our Court decided it 5 to 4* I dissented, but

the Court decided 5 to 4 that that was a properly selected
jury.

And tha argument against it was not that this man was,

sr.

<2

.

damaged, but that/vou take a group of the upper class and put
them on the juries to deal with property offenses, you're apt

to get a more prejudiced jury against the defendants.
MRS• BEASLEYs But there again you9 re talking about

33
harm, and you’re talking about prejudice which this man here
doesn’t claim.
q

As a matter of fact, what you’ve got
we don’t know.

We don’t know.

I mean if, once

■© — maybe some whites would like to have blacks, or maybe
they’d be more sympathetic in the light of the nature of the
charge made against him. We don’t know.

This is highly

speculative.
MRS. BEASLEYs

Oh, yes, indeed.

But — and if he

claims some affinity or some identity with those who were
excluded, or for some reason thinks that the exclusion of those
are going to affect his case, then he would be in a position
to claim it.
But to just take the concept out of the air and say
that *—
q

it’s taken out of the Constitution, it’s the

definition of a jury trial? what is a jury trial.

This was

the issue that we faced, 1 think, in Faye v. hew York.

And

we unfortunately adopted your point of view, I think.
MRS. BEASLEY:

Well, 1 would ask that that position,

of course, be. maintained again in this case.

And the Court

there —* 2 think you mentioned, Mr. Justice Douglas, Ballard?
and of course those cases are not — are inopposite, because
theme -re on the basis of the supervisory powers of the court,
and the court doesn't look into whether there’s prejudice or
not, because Congress has laid down the policy• And x think

34
th ■"*'5 s one of the points that was made in Fay® f that where
a
?o':v
talking aboiit/constitntional right, that's a distinction
«

as to when you're claiming a -statutory violation,
Because if it5s a statutory violation, there’s no
question as to whether it does harm or not; that's already been
decided.

Whereas if you're talking about a lack of due

process or equal protection, then you must show some harm,
And 2 think one of the best analogies that I came
across was the decision in Witherspoon, and particularly since
It was followed by the Bumper case the same day.
There was also a procedure which it was found —
criminal part of the criminal proceedings which was found to
be in violation of the Constitution, And that was the
questioning that was used in death-penalty cases, or at least
capital felony case where the death penalty was a possibility.
And it was found without question that it made the jury prone
towards giving the death penalty; but the Court didn’t go so
far as to say:

therefore we are going to eliminate his whole

conviction? because there was no connection between the
questioning which had to do with the sentence and the convic­
tion,

The concept of guilt or innocence.
Sof since he couldn't show any harm flowing to him,

even though this was an unconstitutional questioning system
that was being used, since it didn't, affect him, we’re not
going to overturn his conviction.

Pad that,happened specifically in the Bumper ease,
where, although the questions ware used, he had gotten life
imprisonment, so it dido.*f matter to him? it didn't affect him,
those improper, unconstitutional, lack of due process kind of
questions *

Because it didn't affect him, since he wasn't ~~
Q

1 suppose that follows logically if you decide

that the jury can mean anything that a local- prosecutor and a
local court decides it should mean,
MRS. BEASLEYs

Not at all, X think he certainly is

entitled to a fair trial.

Q

Well, then it comes down to prejudice in a

particular case.

But 1 thought we had a "definition in the

constitutional terms

what does a jury trial mean’?

Just like speech, what is press?
obscenity?

Does it include

What is a criminal prosecution in the Sixth

Amendment; does it include derangement?
1 mean things of that kind,
MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

Yes, I think that’s —

— where you don't have a showing of prejudice

in a particular case, but merely the scope of the design of
the Constitution.
MRS. BEASLEY; But what he's claiming here, and it
was indicated, not only in the briefs below but also in oral
argument, he's claiming that he was denied due process because
of his sixth Amendment right.

The Sixth Amendment right talks

38
zm impartial jury, and he doesn't say he had an impartial
jury „
Moreover.,

if you follow the theory that there’s

presumed prejudice if Negroes are excluded, the

dice going

against a Negro, then there must be, on the converse, favor
towards the white man if Negroes are excluded.
So here he is in a position sayings

X was denied

due process but I really wasn't denied an impartial jury, 1
was given a favored jury in my circumstances»
He doesn't show anything that would affect the
impartiality of his own jury»

And again the question I would

like to point out that was raised in the petition for certiorari
dealt only with the grand jury; whereas, the brief expanded
it to include the petit jury;, and I thought that the grant of
the petition limited it to the grand jury, which
Q

would —

Would that make any difference?

MRS« BEASLEY;

I think it would, because a grand jury

may not have even been aware of discolor, whereas a trial jury
might„
So,

the nature of what a grand jury's duties are,

really had nothing to do with the nature and duties of a trial
jury when all they do is prefer the charge»
And in this particular case, and perhaps in this case,-.
he never claimed
Q

Well, on that basis, then, all the court’s older

■

:oss that are dealing with just the grants jury are wrong,
MRS. ttAS::<SYs

Mo, I think not, because, again, we

say that in order fco reach or to have an impartial jury is to
have a fair jury system selection.

You must not exclude

Negroes in order so that Negroes themselves will not be
discriminated against.
But I think he has gone too far in saying that we
will presume a prejudice here.

He hasnst suggested what it

would arise from, and I would suggest that there is no harm in
this case.
Q

Well, do you

have you -- you probably

have read Stranger v. West Virginia very recently, haven't you?
MRS. E-EASLEY:

Yes.

Justice Strong's opinion.

Q

Wouldn't you agree

that at least the first few pages of the opinion of Justice
Strong in that case emphasise — this was a removal case, as
we both agree — emphasise the right of Negro citizens to serve
on juries, not the right of Strauder to ba tried by a representa­
tive jury.

And that opinion implies, doesn't it, that Strauder

is in a position to assert the right of Negro citizens to serveon juries, a right that was denied them by the law of West
Virginia.
MRS. BEASLEY: But that's not the right that’s being
asserted here.

The right that’s being asserted here is his

own personal right, Peters’ own personal right as it affected

38
him.

Ha's saying that he was denied due process, not people

out in the community who weren't represented on the jury.
So I don't think that it's particularly —
Q

Well, I thought he said that a trial by this

jury violated due process of law and equal protection of the
law.

A trial of anybody by this jury, white, or black, or any

other color, because this jury was created by a system that,
as a system, denied Negroes their rights to serve on juries.
And those rights are, perhaps for the first time were
articulated in the Strauder case, and most recently they were
in the Carter case and its companion eases, isn't that right?
MRS. BEASLEY § Well, that may very well be, in the
sense that the system should be changed.

As a matter of fact,

it was, right after the Whit us decision carae down in 196?.
And now the statute does — the Georgia statute does call for
a representative cross-section.
Q

Yes, but we’re talking about this person's

standing.
MRS. BEASLEY: And I think he has none.
Q

Doesn’t Strauder indicate that he does?

MRS. BEASLEY:

I think not.

He doesn’t claim it

here, in the first place, and I don’t think ■—
Q

Ha claims a denial of equal protection and of

due process.
MRS. BEASLEY:

In his trial.

39
Q

In the trial of him.

MRS. E3ASLEYs
Q

Not in all the trials in the county.

Well,, he's only interested in his trial? of

course , and **“*
MRS. BEASLEY:

But the question is, and I think the

Court's decisions with respect to jury discrimination show this,
not in Georgia's discrimination but other due process types of
things? that it's harm to him, which —
Q

Well, don't the Court's decisions —

•MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

— was a personal right,

before —

Don't the Court's decisions which explicitly

hold that nobody has a right to have people of his own race
on his trial jury, don't those cases imply that what, the
person is complaining of is the right of citizens to serve on
a jury?
MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

Under a general system.

MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

Which is somebody else's right.

And he has no standing.

1 mean if —- and I think you will agree

our

cases have consistently held that no Negro person has any
right to have any Negroes on his jury that tries him, or the
.grand jury that indicts him.
MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

That's correct, isn't it?

Yes, indeed.

Well now? doesn't it follow from that that he

must be asserting some other right if he is allowed to attack

40
z\ system as unfair? even though he’s not allowed to attack
a particular jury that's unfair.
Then? mustn't it follow that he's allowed to attack
the system? i*e»? the system that prevents citizens from serving
on the jury?
MRS* BEASLEY:

Yes? indeed? he's attacking the system?

and that's what he would have to do if he had raised it properly
at the time and introduced as evidence to show that there was
systematic exclusion? perhaps; but he doesn't have a claim here.
Because he doesn't tie himself into a denial of any right that
he has.
The cross-section concept has always been in terms
of equal protection cases and used in that terra where somebody
has been excluded? and the person who has been tried is a member
of that excluded group? and so it's the harm flowing to him.
Q

That wasn't true in Carter? or in Turner.

MRS. BEASLEY:

But those were the people who were

excluded from serving on the juries.
Q

Right.

Q

Isn't it in the nature of the due process argu­

ment that it’s process? system? procedure? which is being
attacked?
MRS. BEASLEYs-

Yes? indeed? but 1 don’t think — and

again I’ll give you another analogy — that merely showing that
there has been something wrong with the system can be sufficient

41
to overturn the conviction of the person who says lie has bean
denied due process,

Ke has been denied due process,,

The

rhether he has been
deprived of his liberty Without due process of law, not
somebody else.
How, the second analogy 1 would like to present,
other than the Witherspoon case, would be the very recent
cases following U. S._ vs. Jackson, and X point particularly to
Brady, where, although the statute was declared to be
unconstitutional in Jackson, in Brady the Court said it dxdn•t
matter in his case even though the death penalty and jury tie-"

in under the kidnapping statute in Jackson was used and was
involved in Brady's case, still it didn't affect his plea.
And therefore, we're not going to overturn his plea.

Because

it didn't — the use of the statute in that case didn't harm
him.
and 1 think that we have exactly the same situation

here,,
I think it’s also important that you recognise that
in the eases that are cited by the appellant, which have talked
about an absolute right to a cross-section community, period,
and not talking about exclusion of members of your own race,
is that the rationale in those cases doesn't answer the

question, why should you have this cross-section of community,
period.

42
tod I think that's where they fall short *

If we

whether this should he a cross-section, the id
is to 'stake sure that we have an impartial jury, and that was
have a fair criminal proceeding.
Now, if we do have a fair criminal proceeding with
respect to Peters, then, again, there is no denial of due
process.

And it seems to me, in reading the cross-section
•

’•.

cases, that that really is a measuring device and not a
substantive right, because we say he has a right to a crosssection of the community, not to a proportional representation
or not.to trial by members solely of his race.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We*11 resume right there

after lunch.
MRS. BEASLEY s Thank yon.
[Whereupon, at 12s00 o5clock, noon, the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.ra., the same
day.]

AFTERNOON SESSION
Cl;00 p.m.J
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Beasley, you have

about four minutes — no, you have one minute left.
MRS. BEASLEY; Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I wanted to address the question in the discussion
that was had with Mr. Justice Stewart, with regard to the
Strauder case.
I think there is a vast distinction here, because
this arises under the Federal 'Habeas Corpus Act, and under the
theory of Federal habeas corpus or habeas corpus generally,
a person would be chailening his own conviction and saying
that he was denied his own constitutional rights by virtue
of something that happened at his trial or afterwards? whereas
Strauder, of course, being the removal statute case, involves
something else entirely in its. context.
Moreover, Strjauder, too, was Negro, in that case,
t

and the opinion does talk to a great extent about prejudice,
that evolved to him? which we don't have in this case at all.
He is not — Peters is not a person:aggrieved by what
he claims is not proper in that sense.
Q

Unless you take the position suggested by my

brother Douglas that the very constitutional definition of a jury
is a jury selected under a system which does not discriminate,
and that every man, every criminal defendant has a due

44
process right to he tried by a jury selected under such a nondi ,sc>riminatory system.
It would be then an abstract
principle, which has not been held, but the application of
constitutional rights in other contents, I think*

And I think

in answer to that I would quote from, the Faye case, which Mr.
Justice Douglas mentioned, in 1947s

"Defendants have shown no

intentional and purposeful exclusion of any class, and they
have shown none as prejudicial to them.

They have had a

*

fair trial, and no reason exists why they should escape its
results.

To reverse the judgment, free from intrinsic infirmity.

and perhaps to put in question other judgments based on verdicts
that resulted in the same method of selecting the jury reminds
too much of burning the barn in order to roast the pig.”
And I think we have that same situation here.
As in Fayeso in Peters;

the challenge to the

judgment under the due process clause must stand or fall on
the showing that these defendants have had a trial so unfair as
to amount to a taking of their liberty without due process of
law.
And I think on this record we find that it doesn't
raise anything more than that he is a white person, he. doesn't
raise any infinity or identification with those who are not a
member of the

class? doesn't allege that he's a member of the

class, or was harmed? and therefore I think that this judgment

•. '"a h.o. rot he overturned ,
Shank you.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mrs. Beasley„

Mr. Garlandi you have about four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD T„ M. GARLAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GARLAND:

I wish to urge that this Court take the

position and declara one of the fundamental concepts of a trial
by jury is the right of all citizens to a representative
cross-section.
We take issue with the statement that this jury from
which blacks were excluded favored the petitioner? that is, to
assume that it had a bias of some sort in assuming, you can
say it was a white bias.

We say all the juries should be

absent white bias or other types of bias,.

And that that is

the fundamental issue here.
,

In commenting upon what has been the status of the

law, I wish to quote, in conclusion, from Justice Wisdom in
Labat v. Bennett, where.ha' quoted from Shakespeare * s Measure
for Measure, and that is;

"That the law hath not been dead,

but it has been asleep."
We ask you to wake it up as it relates to the right
to a representative process.
Thank you very much.
■ MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Garland.
