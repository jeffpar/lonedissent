I had never thought anyone would seriously contend that

you could make an adequate psychiatric examination.;, in every
phase, of a patient who will not answer* any questions.

Mow, I

am not talking about e. catatonic patient or some patient who

• A

My answer ia two-fold, Mr. Chief Justice.

Da

the first place, this is not a completely normal psychiatric
examination in the sense of someone being committed to an
insane asylum because the standards are different under this
particular statute.
Secondly, the testimony

in the Kurd case is clear

that, while it is extremely difficult to find out whether
someone is a defective delinquent without talking to Mm, and
while, in many cases, you may not be able to do it, the testi­
mony

is also clear that it can be done in some circumstances.
Q

In some cases.

A

In some oases, yes.

I do not for a moment claim

that it- can necessarily be done with him.

I don’t know.

That is correct*

How, our arguments, although^ list at least five
different constitutional provisions, come down really to two
points.

First, no matter what his reasons for refusing to

there is no reason at all, the state cannot keep him
confined indefinitely without a hearing, and particularly
past the end. of hi ; criminal sentence.

If ho doesn’t like the color of the hair of

the psychiatrist, he is entitled to go back to the court and
have that issue determined as to whether they are entitled to

How long would you think

I would think th© system set up by the statute

him for six months and then they are supposed to report back
to th© court.

It may be that they can say, without talking to him,

we can find he is or :1s not a defective delinquent, based
upon six months of observation and his records.

one way or the other?

The Court can’t do any better, certainly.

Well, your Honor, I am not sure about that, for

determination.

It is the Court that makes the determination,

on the basis of the record and the recommendation,

Kell, is the option open for the judge to say,

"well, I can’t now, but I won’t send him to prison, I’ll let
him servo out his sentence in Patuxent."
A

Well, you Honor, I certainly don’t think that

he ought to be serving our his sentence in Patuxent if they
cannot make a determination that ha is, in fact, a defective
s

delinquent.
Q

They are —

A

X.? he were at where he had been

It is on,, of the ironies of this situation that he can't get
therapy at Patuxent, where they are supposed to give it, and
he could have gotten it if he had boon sent to Hagerstown*
Q.

Maybe not, if he had remained quiet there.

A

Pardon mo?

Q,

Maybe not, if he had remained quiet there.

Q,

Oh, no, no, you are assuming they could give

him therapy without talking to him.
A
the kind;

He might well tails if he didn't have to answer
of questions that ar© going to be directed to him

by Patuxent.

He might well feel that he would participate in

a group therapy or even a personal therapy if it wasn't the
kind of thing that ia designed here.
How,

let y focus on that for -x moment*

H

That is really only speculation, though, isn't it?

A

Well, I don't think so.

If your Honor will look

at our brief — if your Honor will look at page 36 of our brief
and look at footnote 43, now this is extracted from the report
of the medical office and shows the interrogation that they
e.vhe preliminarily, merely to find whether he should go to
Patuxent.

And let e look at some of the questions they were

asking hiia to sec why he wasn't onowering questions.

ii!.

"H© adamantly and vehemently denies, despite the
notice reports, tl.

he mao involved in the offense*

Further

questioning revealed that he had stolod some shoes, but he
indicted he didn't know they mere stolen*

In the tenth grade

he got caught taking acme milk and cookies.”

Down a little further, "He was adamant in insisting on
this version of the offense, despite the police report, which
was in the brief and which 1 had available and discussed with
him," and so forth.
How, why were these questions asked,.and why would,
similar questions be asked at Patuxent?

The reason is, that in

order for him to be declared a defective delinquent, they have

to find that he hr,; engaged in persistent criminal and anti­
social conduct.

Now, in this case, w© only have one conviction,

But apparently they had some things in hia record that they
wanted to question him about.
If they cm get from his own lips that, yes, he stole
the milk in school and, yea, he stole some shoos, and yea, he
did some other things, they cm make a finding based on his own
admissions that ho engaged in persistent criminal conduct.
4

And that shows he is a delinquent and then from

then on, the only question is whether or not he 1 s defective.
Is that it?
A

Well, no, as a matter of fact, your Honor, it

«:oo5 to the entire definition.

In order to be a defective

delinquent, you have to find that he has engaged in this*
(■l

He may be a very "effective" delinquent»

A

That is very well put, you? Honor*

If your

Honor will look at page 6, in footnote 6 ~~
Q,

Your- brief, again?

A

Yes.

delinquent" is defined as "an individual, who, by the demons'tra*-tion of persistant aggravated antisocial or* criminal behavior

1 don’t think

X?
they have to make a separate determination that he is- in fact,
either a defective delinquent or that he is psychotic or
anything else.

It is available at prison.

Here, however, in order for* him to get therapy, he
haa first got to be found to be a defective delinquent and
got off that receiving tier into the first tier.
Q,

That goes to your point that after six months, in

any event, he had to go back to the prison.
a

Correct.

Q

Under the Maryland statute, would the Maryland

Court judge having that hearing, after the six months in
Patuxent, have the power and authority to say,

"Well, I think

we will try this again so I can sent you back for another
90 days.'1

Or is six months the outside limit?
A

Your Honor, I think it would depend a lot upon

the circumstances of the individual file.

I think, for

example, lei 's saj "for example,” the institution comes back
and it says,

”We haven't been able to talk to him, but on the

other hand, we've been able to gain some valuable information
by watching him.

On the other hand, because of scarcity of

personnel, we have only been able to watch him for a limited
number of months.

If we could have two more months to watch

him, I think we will be able to come in with a recommendation.
It might well be that that would not be so unreasonable
as to be

constitutional violation.

I don't think you can

18

lay down a flat rule.
Q,

Does It violate the statute to do that?

A

Ho, because if -••• so long as they report back

within six months,

I think if tho Court were to make a finding

that they were ent tied to look at him again, it could well be
extended.
Q,

What if the judge just said, 'Here,"to this men,

"You haven’t cooperated.
am going

go

We can’t help you until you do.

I

send you back fox» another six months.”

A

Well, in this --

Q,

Let’s say aside the Constitution for a minute*

Does the Maryland statute permit that?
A

Well, if the judge were to find that he was

refusing to cooperate or. purely arbitrary grounds, with no
grounds at all, and he were so to inform the man so that the
man would have a judicial finding that the grounds that he
wv.a asserting for refusing to cooperate were invalid, then it
might well be that, in effect, they would be giving him a
second, chance to cooperate and he might, or might not.
But in this case — in this case — where the man is
refusing to cooperate because of the questions that they are
trying to ask him, where it would be violating the Fifth
Amendment for him to do this, then I very respectfully submit
that the court is not going to order him back to answer because
the reason is the same.

And I don’t ace how we can conceivably

19
gel around the Fifth Amendment in this ease.
Q.

Well, the facts of this case don't require you

tc ..-oak on any exploration of a statutory period of time less
than the period o.t hi a confinement under the- criminal
3 entenc o,

do thoy?
A

1

would he taking the position her©, even if his

criminal sentence aad not expired, that ho was entitled to a
judicial hearing, when they refused to do anything with him
except say that he can be kept indefinitely.

But I think this

that once his sentence has been served, whatever excuse there
xaay have been, up until that period, for keeping him, whether
they want to look at him some more, or whether they want to
give M:.'. more chances to talk or whatever, totally disappears,
because at that point, he has served his debt to society, the
period for them to report and hold a hearing is long since
gone.
Let me show you why they don't have a hearing,
Mr. Justice.

They don't have a hearing because there is

nothing they eon got out of it.

If they hold a hearing and

he is said not to be a defective delinquent, ho goes free.
If they hold a hearing and hs is determined to be a
defective delinquent, what does he get?

He gets precisely

the sentence he has got right now, which is an indefinite
confinement.

They claim they can keop him for life because

ho refuses to anew-r these incriminating questions, so why
hold a hearing?

20

Prom their standpoint, the only way ho can got out
of the receiving tier and. get a report is by saying, ’’Yes, I
£■ i;ole

v.;

cookies in iighschooi," arid 1 might say parenthe­

..

tically, it is rathor odd, but in Maryland, there is no
statute of limitations at all on any crime for which you can
be sentenced to prison.

They can go back with a man who is

80 years old and convict him for something he did when he was
25j so it ia a very real and serious problem for this man

where they are saying, "Didn’t you really steal these shoes,
and look at what the FBI report says, and wo know you weren’t
convicted of this, but tell

us, weren’t you really?" and then

they go in — they actually go in to a defective delinquency
hearing and testify about —
Q

I am familiar that there is no statute of

limitations for crimes like murder, but you mean that in
Maryland, there is no statute of limitations on any crime?
a

On any crime for which

you can be sentenced to

Q

Mr. Prettyman, I think X understood you to say

prison.

that you thought the system at Patuxent was essentially a good
one, but assume for the moment that Mr. McNeil had cooperated
and had gone right down the, line with the system, including
,the final judicial hearing, and had been adjudged to be a
defective delinquent, bringing into operation the indetorminent
sentence.

hould you bo here today if you had that case?

21
A

X would be a petitioner in Murel, probably,

your Honor.
Q.

That’ s a case we had here -«•

A

I would be adopting, probably, many of the

objections to the system that Mr. Murel and the other
petitioners had.

But this, I want to emphasize, is a very,

very different ease.

It was more like Ayey, on3.y Mr* Avey

died and therefore that issue wasn't before you there, but
.it is more akin to that case*
Q,

But your position, as I understand it, is that a

sure way to avoid the system, at Patuxent is not to cooperate
with It and if your term is one year or three years or five
years, when that expires, you are out automatically.
A

Not necessarily, because, as in the McKenzie

case, they may find you to be a defective delinquent anyway,

if they have a proper record and can uphold that.

How, 1 must

say, in this case, they say in their brief that they do not
have enough evidence to uphold him, to find him to bo a
defective delinquent.
they say they have got?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Q,

Very well, Hr. Prettyraan.

Just before you sit down, even though you won,

couldn’t it ho sort of a Pyrrhic victory?

Couldn’t he be then

A

Oh, he could be civilly committed, possibly, if

he qualified.
Q,

That is to say, if we decided that he is now

entitled to his release, then the very next day, couldn’t he
be civilly committed?
A

Well, under the civil commitments, you would have

different standards than you do hero.

in these briefs, only those excerpts -which are directly
bearing on the outcome of the disposition of the particular
arguments made by the petitioner.
Now, before 1 get to the question of whether or not
there is a privilege against self «•incrimination, which I think
is a pivotal point in this argument of the petitioner.
I would like to emphasise that the transfer, in July
of 1966, or August of 1966 of the petitioner to Patuxent
was a

valid transfer under any fair reading of the cases of

this Court, where the case is of the Circuit Court’s appeal.
Now, Mr. McNeil was.convicted of committing two crimes
either one of which is a threshold crime under Section 6A of
the defective delinquency statute.

One, was assault upon a

police officer which, under Section 6A, is a crime of violence,
a threshold ’.rime triggering the operation of the statute*
The second crime was attempted rape, under Section
: A(4), a sex crime involving physical force or violence.
Now, there was a conviction on both charges.

The

sentence, It is true, was five years.

The sentence, of course

was discretionary with the trial judge.

The case was heard

non-jury and, on a point that I .hope to return to later in
nee clearly could have been at least 25

yours, if the maxioaua had been imposed and if the sentences
had been In the two indictments to run consecutively rather
than concur?ently.
Q

Do you agree with Mr. Pretty.ro.an there is nothing

in the record to show why the judge insisted on the psychiatri
examination?
A

There is nothing in the record to demonstrate

that, your Honor.
The next thing tho judge did was based upon his
personal observation of the defendant during the course of
this trial.

He felt that ho had reasonable cause to believe

a psychiatric examination was necessary.

In fact, he ordered

an immediate psychiatric examination by the medical officer,
Dr. John Sheehan of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City.
How, Dr. Sheehan’s report is vary interesting because
in three respects, it comports exactly with the definition of
defective delinquency, and I don’t think that this was a
knowing or conscious effort on Dr. Sheehan’s part, tout if you
will turn to page 23 of the respondent’s brief, Dr. Sheehan’s
report is set out in full.

A

2ij.j your Honor.

Mow, Dr. Sheehan found, after

examination, that the petitioner had an unstable character
ai:-‘-acture.

Compare Section 5 of the definition of defective

delinquency, which talks in terms of ©motional imbalance*

He

also found that there was a ’’rigidity of defenses" which was
a pessimistic sign that further offenses may occur.
Compare the Statute, the definition, which talks in
terms of whether the defendant evidences a propensity toward
crirrdnal activitics.
And, finally, he said that the petitioner-defendsnt
there was certainly a. danger to society.

Compare again the

definition of defective delinquency which requires that the
petitioner clearly demonstrate an actual danger to society*
H ow " «*
Q,

Mr. lord, I’m sorry I can't agree with you that

tbs Doctor did that without any consideration of the requirecents

.tor Patuxent, unless I am wrong.

Am I correct that he

was told to find out whether or not this man was subject to
go to Patuxent?
A

I don’t think that is exactly right, but it is

a point that is —
Q,

Well, it wasn’t his right to stand trial.

He

had already been convicted,
A

Correct.

Q,

So there would be some connection with Patuxent

26
A

He was asked to be psychiaferieally examined and

the recommendation of the psychiatrist was that he be

vransferrod, ?.nd that is in the report, to Patuxent for
©valuation.
Q,

And he knew what the requirements were?

A

Very well *

Q.

Sure»

A

He could very well have and I would certainly

think that he would have.
Q,

Sure.

A

But this was in the nature of pr©sentence

investigation and the court had perfectly adequate grounds for
ordering it.
Bow, after personal observation of the defendant,
knowledge of his past activities* no criminal record, but some
record of criminal involvement under a unique Maryland practice
called '’probation before verdict" for two charges, assault
and robbery and rape, this was all before the court.

The

psychiatrist’s report was before the court and at that point,
the court found that ho had reasonable cause to believe that
the petitioner was a defective delinquent.

He then ordered him,

and the terms of the order are in the footnote on page 6 of the
petitioner's brief, the white

brief, h© ordered that the

.petitioner bo transferred to the custody of the director of
the Patuxent Institution for observation, examination, and

evaluation for the purpose of determining whether or not he is
a d 6 f © c t i v o d e 1 ino u eat«
How, I should say — because this came up in the
Mur el argument -- that 98 percent of the referrals to
Patuxent are court.- initiated immediately after conviction of
an offense and so this is not an unusual type of practice at
all,

The other two percent are initiated by the various

other sources Hr. Justice Marshall mentioned in the last
argument that the Department of Correction can initiate or
suggest to the court that there be a transfer, but, of course,
it is always done under court order,
liov;, so we have a transfer by court order, unreasonable
cause,

How, at Patuxent, there is, of course, evaluation.

There are no cases, a,4 X have suggested, not Lynch, versus

suggests that there was anything constitutionally improper

A

Yes, that is one of the issues in Murel,

It is in Mur el.

Mow, there ia also reference to the federal statutes,
Section

42-Jj.l

of Title

lQ.

I suggest, in passing, that the

Maryland Statute on this point provides more duo proeea
protections than does that federal statute*

Bear in mind

that if a man has a 25-year sentence under the federal statute,
he never hew; any tudi dally-supervised transfer or, indeed, a
full-dress .judicial hearing until the 25th year.

He is

transferred by, essentially, an administrative act, from a

penitentiary to a hospital.

There is no hearing arid no court

action even on the act of signing the court order.
hot , of course, we are not getting, in this case, to

29
the whole question of the due process surroundings of the
subsequent heaping for defectivo delinquency because, for

sons which I will soon get into, there has not been one

and eight months.

He has been there for five years

He has never been evaluated*

had his defective delinquency hearing.

He has never

He has never had, any

treatment because diagnosis has been impossible*
Q,

If he had been sent back at the end of the

first six months with a report that ho had refused to cooperate
on five or seven occasions or whatever it might have been at
that time, do you agree with Mr. Prottyman’s analysis that
the district judge'would have the discretion to send him back
for further examination at Patuxent?
A

Yes, your Honor.

The statute makes the

assumption — I think it just cries out from a fair reading
of this statute — that there would be cooperation.

I don't

really think the draftsman ever contemplated the kind of
situation we are dealing with here and, hence, the requirement
that a six-month's period must

at the end of that there

must be a report back to the court, contemplates that there
can be diagnosis and. a report made,

2 don’t think there is any

problem at all about the court extending that time further if

30
there lc any reasonable chance that the result is going to be
•any different ut the end cf another fixed period, and that is
what troubles ,ie about your Honor-'a suggestion*
reason for the st .t

There is no

to believe that if, at the end of six

norths. the petitioner has accomplished his purposes in not
having a diagnosis, that ho is suddenly going to have a change
of heart in the second six months or the third six months %
fci

Well, what about —

Q,

Well, you have no reason to believe that any­

thing on it one way or the other — isn't it a little — isn’t
that speculating?
A

I agree it la speculating, sir*

Q,

I moan, it gives a judicial audit of the

custody every six months.
A

That’s true, and I agree that to put the state

to the requirebant of having an immediate hearing at that point
would clearly bo m 'unsatisfactory result of the state’s
standpoint *
(4

Would it be speculative to assume what might

happen if they didn't ask him how many crimes he committed?
A

I'm not sure I understand you.

Q.

I mean, if the psychiatrist asked

some other

questions, other than what crimes he had committed?
A

Well, bear in mind

'4

He might have agreed.

A

Mr. Frettyman pointed out that the whole

definition of defective delinquency is geared towards a
propensity toward:.) criminal activity.

There may be other

ways of identifying that- other than asking specifically —
Q

We s&igkt be interested in getting him into

Patuxent because we are interested in getting him out*
A

Right.

‘Q,

What you are talking about is what you need to

get him in, but suppose the psychiatrist says, “Look, 1 want
to help you anci. I m not interested at all in the other crime
you've committed.

We are going to look to the future♦"

He

might have cooperated*

Of course.

has said,

He simply

"I am not going to cooperate.’’
Q,

So as of now, as long aa he refuses to answer

incriminating questions, lie is there until the end of his
life.
A

That’s right*

Q

Is that right?

A

How, lab me come right to that point.

Q.

That’s right.

A

Thao is right.

Q,

You mentioned earlier that the judge could have

given bin 20 year .

He — on that basis ~~

Well, what be has now been given is life.

Ho, tomorrow, may change his

attitude on this same question.
Q,

It has to be on the state’s terms.

A

That1 a true.

Q,

As to what ha says.

A

Absolutely right, because the statute requires -

Q,

Ho has no Fifth Amendment right at all?

A

The state contends ho has no Fifth Amendment

rights.
Q,

Ho lost that when he got convicted, or did he

lose that when he wont to Patuxent?

When did he lose it?

A

I wouldn't say that he lost it at all*

Q,

I thought you said h© didn't have it.

A

He had a Fifth Amendment right in the criminal

proceeding.

He does not have a Fifth Amendment right in the

proceedings at Patuxent»
Q,

Mr. Lord, even if you are right that he doesn’t

have a Fifth Amendment "right in his proceedings in the
diagnostic

ige of Patuxent, it seems to me you have got a

ch mono difficult case to argue here than you argued in
/ol because the petitioners in Mural, who were still in a
diagnostic case, hud not served out their sentences and there

33
DcmetMnf; to >o said *— at least X felt from the
argument that they are certainly no worse off

in

the

diagnostic core ?;t Patuxent than they are at some other prison.
But if your r:.an has served out his term» it seems to me there
is quite a burden cm you to justify the keeping of him on the.ro,
1

But;. hr* Justice, we have to ask ourselves the

question of why has this happened?

And it has happened

because there hue boon an inability, because of the petitioner s
actione, anci I think all parties agree here, because of

the

petitioner! t actions there has been am inability to carry­

out the statutory requirements.
Now, if you are suggesting to the state that by this
lack of cooperation, conscious, planned, continuing lack of

cooperation, the whole structure at Patuxent

not just for

tie petitioner her", but for every person who is referred for
evaluation, that this is. an available remedy to frustrate the
Patuxent proceeding, I suggest that the state strongly objects
to that.
0,

Well, your statutory scheme eventually contemplates

a judicial hearing on the fact of defective delinquency and so
I think it earn be argued that a delay in that hearing and
adjudication

then, so long as the man is still under the

sentence, m.ay be justified on a number of grounds, but when
you continue to detain him after the expiration of hia
sentence without any now judicial determination aa to why he

ho should bo so treated.

factory, which would require -« Would

break the circle h,re* I think.
low, the most obvious one it: that at that point in
time, when a man’s sentence is about to expire, or at that
point in time at the end of six months when a report, because
of non-goop..cation, has been impossible, the petitioner is
sk

before the court «• and bear in mind that the

order transferring him runs to the institution -- he is put
under a specific order directly in court to cooperate with the
diagnostic procedures at Patuxent Institution and his failure
subsequently to so cooperate would bring about a conviction
for contempt of court, probably, direct criminal contempt of
court.
low, there is nothing in the Maryland Statute that
would provide it, but the State suggests to this Court that
there is nothing in the Constitution of the Chited States
which would prevent it, either.
Q,

You don’t think that might create a Pierce

problem at all?
A

Well, the problem, of course, in — I must say,

of ccur so, it is a new subject and I don’t think that I can
point to any particular case.

But I just wondered — don’t you think, Mr. Lord,

that might oresent a Fierce problem?

hare that the statute is written for the protection of the
petitioner and for reasons known only to him, he has elected
not to allot/ that statute to operate,
Q,

Kay I ask, incidentally, 1 was surprised to hear

Mr. Prettyman tell us that there ax»© offenses other than
capital offenses for which you have no statute of limitations
at all?
A

Well, I think I con clarify that.

There is a

statute of limitations for all misdemeanors in Maryland of
one year.

For all non-misdemeanors there is no statute,

for all felonies there is no statute of limitations.

Well,

The

business about imprisonment more accurately could be stated
as follows, for felonies, ns a general rule, the sentence
upon, conviction is to the Maryland Penitentiary.

For all other

offenses, they may go to other facilities in the state and so,
fer those offense?, which can lead to Incarceration at the
Maryland Penitentiary, namely felonies — all felonies — there
is no statute of limitations.
Q,

I didn’t think that your response in your brief

to the Fifth Amendment was quit© in order, with all respect,
because you said merely that Maryland had never used this
evidence to convict a man of another offense, but the federal

36
.viancUrd of the Fifth Imen&ment has always been, since the
.....

,fo>n Marshall, the possibility of a criminal convict lor.-;

aa you know*
A

I think 1 can respond to that very quickly*

It

is covered in a nv;.C-or of pageo of the brief and I think It
could have boon considerably shortened*
Miranda versus Arisotm, plus the point of view of the
staff at Patuxent, plus the guamtee that I herewith deliver
to this Court, will bind the State of Maryland that evidence
obtained during the course of psychiatric evaluation, for

diagnosis at Patuxent will not be used by the State of
Maryland in any subsequent criminal proceedings and I think
that the lower court's opinion

Judge Watkin'a opinion in the

Sas case, which •*** the record of which is part of the Mur el
record and lance part of this record —• also boars that point
out,

I just don't think it needs any further attention.

hasn’t happened in 1? years anci tho state fools bound, under
Miranda, the extension of Miranda, that it could not happen
in the future.

to that very question.

I

providos a clear answer *
The state is perfectly prepared to have a proper

fools it has to inquire into the mental state of this

The state has no interest in keeping a man

A

Not to my knowledge and, nor, under the federal

statute, to my knowledge, there has been no complaint.

Now,

the petitioner argues that the federal statute provides, mandatos

a hearing at the end of the man’s sentence to require him to
be kept beyond his sentence, and there it mat be proven that
there is 302.0 doubt as to whether he will be a threat to the

Couldn't Maryland solve this problem with a

I don’t think it

disclosed in the psychiatric examination may bo used any­

where*

A

It would, but, your Honor, 1 don’t think we

have to wait for the Maryland Legislature to decide whether —
Q,

Well, no, you can't control the Legislature,

but that would solve the problem?
A

That would solve it, but I don't think that we

have to go that far in order to solve it*

You say you got that mils.

Q,

That' s correct.
But that still isn't going to guarantee your

That certainly is not.

Mow, we are stripping

away tho reasons for non-cooperation.
Now, the other reasons for non-cooperation, 7. think,
tha only fair reason — fairly debatable, arguable

reason. «•«-

is that there may bo a possibility of further commitment»
This may give grounds to tho psychiatrist for conclusion that
the man's a defective delinquent and may also extend the time
that ho spends at Patuxent if at the hearing he is found to be
a defective delinquent.
But these are not criminal ramifications«

They involv

some loss of liberty, surely, in that he may be kept beyond
his sentence.

But the state has a right to know the condition

of this man’s mind before he is released to society.
example is right in the petitioner's brief.

A good

There is on

example given by Dr. Guttmacher of a man who, upon cooperation
with a psychiatrist had -- he’d been in for two convictions of
pc everfed practices.

He admitted to a psychiatrist that he

;.l engaged in this act with young boys on 20'Q or more

occasions.

Mow, the state is not going to turn around and

prosecute him for those 200 violations.
a right to knew that fact.

But the state has

And the state has a right to

take that into consideration when deciding whether# in fact,
he should be diagnosed as a defective delinquent and, in fact,
he should be kept until some treatment has relieved him of
this obsession which loads him to do this kind of thing*

He

is a danger to society at that point in time«
How, aside

from the suggestion of the Chief Justice

that there bo periodic review by a court, and ray suggestion
of the contempt, there are other alternatives, but 1 want to
suggest- to this Court that they are simply not satisfactory.
We can be put to the test of coming up with a
diagnosis'that is purely speculative, a blind — so-called
"blind diagnosis."

That helps no one.

It probably violates

the vagueness rules of this Court with respect to standards
or application of standards.

If you can encourage trial

courts, if something magic happens at the expiration of a
five-year sentence, trial courts, simply to avoid the
operation of this, will pose maximum sentences or longer
sentences.
Q,

Well, don't you see at least a prophylactic

v -.Xu© in requiring a Judicial inquiry every six months under
this statute?
A

Which the statute seemsto contemplate«
You:- Honor, I would go further than that.

I

kk
would say tliat at the end of aix months, the state should have
a right to have the

petitioner return, to the court and advise

that he had not cooperated during the six-month period and
he must cooperate.
Q

Undor the statute, that could have been done

every six montha for the past six years, couldn't it?
A

l tlank it could have, but if you know that the.

staff is operating, onco again, in a grey area hero, and I
think they probably were very reluctant to go ahead and take
definitive•action with respect to a particular person until
they had a properly framed case.

We now have it and I think

another ramification could be that we just repeal Article 31B
and pass what this Court has uphold many times, an habitual
criminal statute, automatic, knee-jerk reaction, third
conviction, he gate the maximum.
Q,

Of course, this person -•»

Fourth conviction he gets life.

Q,

. this person wouldn't have been subject to any

recidivous statute.

This was his first offense.

That»a true.

loin1 point is that that would require you to

sit back and wait for him to commit three or four crimes.

delighted, tomorrow, to provide a hearing to this petitioner
if it could be given tho tools to makes the evaluation
necessary under the statute.

Q,

Well, all the man is asking for is a hearing.

Any kind of hearing.
A

That’s correct.

Q,

And you say you are not going to give him any

kind of hoaxing except that he says he committed a crime.

Q.

Well, I thought Mr. Prettyman was asking that

he be releaped tomorrow.
A

That’s true.

Q,

If he didn’t get a hearing.

b,e
€>

Ho, released.

Q

Ho, without a hearing.

Mr. Prettymaa's point is

that he now, having served the full five years, must be
released forthwith, hearing or no hearing.
A

Ttuh: is correct, your Honor.

Q.

And without regard to hi a safety to society or

anything cine.
A

That had to be

Frebtymaa's position.

That is his position and the state simply

cannot accept it.

I didn't get a chance to mention that there

is excellent language in the Lipscomb case from California
and in Judge- Sobeloff • a separate opinion in the Tippett case
on the very subject of the state's right to inquire into
thi 0 man5 s mind.
Q,

Lipscomb and Tippett.

A

And finally, I am struck

by a point from

L • . Justice Brandeis in the new state Ice versus Li ©basin case
in which ho said, "It is one of the happy incidents of the
federal system that a single courageous state can engage in
innovative and hum.anitarien. experimentation in the social and
economic field.

The State of Maryland is out front here."

And I think, I submit, that one pf the reasons that
we have been before this Court twice in the last month is
simply that, and I think we are in an area where now ground
has to bo broken for the benefit of everyone*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr* Lord.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAH, ESQ.,
'

m BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. PRETTYMffli:

May it please the Courts

In view of the concessions made by the state, let me
just make one Iasi point in regard, to the remedy.
I indicated that

The reason

I think the man ought to be ordered

iB-mediutoly released as opposed to just having a hearing at
this point is this.

In view of the fact that the state has

said in their brief that they cannot find him to be a
defective delinquent based on this record, in view of the
fact

that I as his attorney am not about to tell him that he

should incriminate himself based on the state’s assurance to
this Court that they don’t plan to convict him on the basis
of what he is going to say, a hearing would be a wasted

gesture.

Hs has now served his full criminal term*
X could read you from cases vitiare things that those

:r: 11.have said in the course of these interviews have then

llfl
.. . court to keep them in Patuxent indefinitely and,
moreover, ice have no idoa how, in view of the fact that what
3..

says go eo right into his file, which is open to the

prosecutor, the information that he gives couldn’t be used
as a link in the chain to troseeute him later.

There are all

kinds of holes in, this.
Q,

Well, I take it you say that this information,

since it would be used in connection with deciding whether he
is a defective delinquent, which might result in extending
his term, is. itself incriminating?
A

I say three, things i

While his original sentence was still open, they could
us© it to reconvict him.

That is no longer true here, but that

is in other cases.
lumber two, they could convict him now and at any
time for anything that ho confessed to in the course of this
interrogation In which they would get evidence of in his file.
And number three, without any question^ they would
use it to keep him in Patuxent indefinitely

because, just to

read you a ~~ Daniel*a case, very brief, this is a man
convicted of housebreaking and larceny and when they tried to
a, they gave evidence of the sexual behavior of the
inmate as a youth and the court said that was all right to
v.

that a© evidence to keep him indefinitely in Patuxent,

..\'.thour, any relationship to his original crime.

Of course. they are going to use it, and that

lb

why

I would never toll this man to talk and why, therefore, J.
think a hearing at this stag© is a waste of gesture and why
ho i>■; entitled to immediate release.

MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER{
