MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments next

in Wo. ?0~220, Caplin against The Marine Midland Grace Trust
Company of New York.
Mr. Miller, you may proceed whenever you3re ready.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES H. MILLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Mr. David Perber, Solicitor of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and I have divided our time, so that I
will take the first 30 minutes and Mr. Forbar 15 minutes
with respect to the argument.

Mr. Farber is similarly arguing

for reversal of the order of the Court of Appeals of the
Second Circuit,
This case is before this Court on writ of certiorari
to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
The case involves the standing of a bankruptcy reorganization
tpter X trustee, to prosecute a claim in the
reorganization proceedings,

I will discuss that claim as I

spell out for the Court the facts with respect to this matter.
The courts below dismissed the trustee’s complaint
and dismissed the other claims sought to be prosecuted by the
trustee by way of counterclaim on the ground that the trustee
had no standing to bring the claims which are in question here.

4
The petitioner in this matter is Mortimer M. Caplin,
Mr, Caplin was named in May of 1965 by the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York as the
reorganisation trustee under Chapter X of Webb & Knapp, Inc.
At one time before its troubles, which led Webb & Knapp into
the reorganisation court, that company was one of the largest
real estate companies in the United States,
The defendant in this case is the Marine Midland
Grace Trust Company of New York,

Marine Midland was the

trustee under a trust indenture with respect to an issue of
5 percent debentures of the debtor.

There are still approxi­

mately $4,200,000 of these debentures outstanding.
In the trust indenture, a copy of which has been
lodged with this Court, there were certain covenants which ware
made by the debtor for the benefit of the debenture holders. But
the single most important

covenant, for the purposes of this

case, was the covenant that the debtor would not incur any
indebtedness or purchase any real property unless its tangible
assets were twice its liabilities.

That is in Section 3,6 of

the crust indenture, and that provision, which we call the
asset to liability ratio provision, is at the heart of this case
There ware certifications required by the debtor
to Marine• Midland, the indenture trustee, year after year, to
the effect that the debtor was not in default in connection
with the.e debentures.

3
Now, Marine Midland requested appraisals with respect
to the value of the real property here, because the principal
assets of this corporation was real estate, and from year to
year, starting in about 1957, at least, the debtor’s offices
furnished to Marine Midland appraisals as to their opinion as
to the value of the real property.

This was all for purposes

of this asset to liability ratio, and insuring that the debtor
v?ould not purchase more real property or incur more
indebtedness unless the asset to liability ratio were indeed
2 to 1, as the covenant provided.
Now, these certificates and these appraisals were
accepted year after year by Marine Midland, without any
question being raised at all.
After Mr. Caplin was named as reorganisation trustee,
he commenced his statutory investigation of the debtor's
affairs under Chapter X of the Chandler Act, and he found
that the appraisals and that the certificates submitted
annually by the debtor’s directors and officers were in fact
false and fraudulent on their face; and that Marine Midland
knew or should have known that these appraisals were inflated.
He further found that Marine Midland wilfully
disregarded these appraisals and these certificates and ware
grossly negligent in failing to recognise how false they were.
/

In fact, the trustee in reorganization, Mr. Caplin, found that
at no time during the period between 1957 and 1965 had the

6
required 2 to 1 tangible asset to liability ratio been main­
tained.
We have, in the petitioner6s main brief at page 4r an
indication of one example of the kind of appraisals about
which we are talking.

There's a certain parcel of real

property in Bronx County in New York,

That real property, with

a net book value of $2,800,000 had been appraised by the
debtor's officers at $15 million in 1957? 27.5 million in 1953«*
one year later, in 1959, at more than double that amount,
$64 million? the same in I960,

tod by 1963, the same parcel,

without any significant improvements on it, had been appraised
by the debtor's officers at — 80 percent of it had been
appraised at $91 million.

So that the whole, parcel had to be

appraised at more than 100 million.
This is just one example of the kind of appraisals
that were involved.
Now, as a result of his investigation, the reorganize
tier trustee determined that it was the gross negligence or
wilful misconduct — not simple negligence, but gross or
wilful misconduct by Marine Midland, which had permitted the
debtor to continue this course of activity of buying more
real estate and entering into transactions involving tens oil
millions of dollars, and incurring more indebtedness, and
that this would inexorably lead to the reorganization court,
where Webb £ Knapp found itself in X9S5.

7
Indaee, it was charged by the reorganization trustee,
''SJ" *

-'-u the complaint, which is in question here ant?

wruch ws?re seeking- to have reinstated, that it was the bank's
failure to enforce this 2 to 1 asset to liability ratio, and
the failure by having received and accepted without question
the appraisals and these certificates which were clearly false
on their race, which caused the net worth of this company to
be reduced from $25 million in December 1958 to a negative
net worth, a deficit figure of $38.5 million at the time that
s®organisation proceeding commenced•
U

Miller, is it your contention that the

obligation in the indenture ran to the benefit of the debtor
or you?
MR. MILLER:

No, we*re saying it ran for the benefit

of the debenture holders, if the Court please.

And this actio,

is sought to be maintained by the reorganization trustee on
behalf of the debenture holders,

That is the question before

this Court.
Q

So the estate can pay claims of the debenture

holders?
MR. MILLhR: That xs correct, and we ssy
Q

The estate was insolvent, wasn’t it?

Ml,, HILLER:
y

The estate was insolvent, yes.

So the only remaining people in interest were

creditors, secured or unsecured?

3

MS. MILLER:

In effect, as things have turned out,

the only remaining people of interest were general creditors,
after secured creditors had been -~
Q

Yes.

And so, once the plan provides for

secured creditors, just unsecured creditors are left,
including debenture holders?
MR. MILLER:

Unsecured creditors and debenture

holders who are classed as general creditors.
Q

Yes.

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

Now, the reorganization trustee, Hr. Caplin, petitioned
in the district court, in the reorganization court, for the
right to start a plenary action against Marine Midland for the
benefit of debenture holders, and the court granted permission
for Mr. Caplin to do so, and then, on the motion of Marine
Midland, the court dismissed the complaint on the ground that
under Second Circuit decision in Clarks

Chase Rationed. Bank

in 1943, the reorganisation trustee had no standing, and was
not the real party in interest; and had no standing to prosecute
a personal claim on behalf of debenture holders.
*

The district court held that it was bound by the Clarke
decision, that the property involved was a claim personal to
the debenture holders and did not involve property of the
estate, and it also held that it was not affect the plan of
reorganization.

9
Uncior Clarke, the reorganization trustee has the
authority and has standing to sue on behalf of debenture
holders if either property of the debtor is involved or the
matter would affect the plan of reorganization.
The district court'held that it would not.
We then went to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals,
and there was argument had before three judges, two of the
three judges would have overruled the Clarke decision and held
that the trustee had standing, the reorganization trustee had
standing; but the Second Circuit, in accordance with its timehonored rule, then submitted the matter on banc to the full
Second Circuit without further argument on the briefs already
submitted; and held, 5 to 2, that there was no standing on
behalf of the reorganization trustee.

The Second Circuit,

in an opoinion by Judge Friendly, held that the reorganisation
trustee had no standing, that Clarke was a proper rule, and
that there was no reason for.this action to be brought by the
reorganization trustee.
There was a vigorous dissent by Judges Irving Kaufman,
Paul Hays to the. effect that there was no reason for the Clarke
rule, and the somewhat artificial distinctions with respect
to property that were involved in that rule, and that the
action should have been permitted to be brought; that, the
reorganisation trustee is indeed the proper party to bring
the action, he's authorized under statute to do so, and he should

10
have been permitted to do so.
Sow, we have set forth in our brief four principal
reasons why we, for the reorganization trustee, assert that
*

there is standing for the reorganization trustee to prosecute
this action against Marine Midland on behalf of the debenture
holders.
Mow, the first reason is that the congressional
scheme for reorganisationr which is evidenced by two
t:

•

•

significant statutory amendments in the late 1930's, two
significant statutory enactments, the Chandler Act which
sets up Chapter X, and the Trust Indenture Act, specifically
provide for a reorganisation process in which the reorganization
trustee is the focal point, and he’s taking the interests
not just of the debtor, not just of the general creditors, but
of investors, stockholders, debt investors, any kind of
investors? and he’s the focal point for all of this.

He

investigates and he tries to find out what happened that lad
the debtor into the reorganization court.
He is then the proper party under the statute to
prosecute any claims which may exist against third parties or
against anybody else,- because without his intercession it is
quite likely that in many instances, at least, the debenture
holders will not prosecute their individual claims? because
many of them may in certain instances have small face amounts
of debentures, and they will not undergo the expanse of

prosecuting their own claims.
We say that in addition to that, secondly, there is
specific statutory authority under the bankruptcy laws, under
Chapter X, for reorganization trustee to sue an indenture
trustee on the kind of claim involved here, and we point to
Section 58? of Title 11, which we set forth in our brief at
page 14, which specifically holds that an equity receiver,
that a reorganisation trustee has all the powers of an equity
receiver.
Now, an equity receiver, under this Court's decision
in the McCandles3 case in 1935, opinion by Hr. Justice Cardoso
held that an equity receiver could sue third parties to, in
effect, return funds or have funds restored to the estate or.
behalf of investors.
Q

Mr. Miller, would you concede that an ordinary

trustee in bankruptcy wouldn't have standing to bring an
action such as you’re seeking to bring here?
MS. MILLER;

Yes, sir.

We are focusing, Mr. Justice

Re linguist, only on the power of the Chapter X reorganization
trustee.
Now, we say, third, that as a practical matter the
reorganization trustee is the best person to bring this
action,

let

the best person because he has, under the

authority, indeed under his duty, made a total investigation
of all of the facts and circumstances leading to the debtor’s

12
demise.

He’s the person before the reorganisation court.

Ho

has found these facts; in many instances he has to prosecute a
claim against others, directors and officers of the debtor,
waxen involve the same facts and the same circumstances, and
uhis action is not brought <— either it may not be bringable
at all, or it will involve redundancy of fact-finding, as
Judge Kaufman held below.
,

finally, we say that the holding of the court

uelow in vhicn a kind of hypertechnical property distinction
or property holding has been superimposed on the reorganization
-taws is just plain wrong; there’s no need for that decision
under ^larke, there is a decision in the Third Circuit, Solar
undsj- which this action, this type of action was, in
effect, permitted to be brought as a counterclaim by the
trustee to the proof of claim and the accounting filed by
the indenture trustee.
We tried, in-:this case, to do it under all three
methods; that is, a plenary action, a counterclaim to a
proof of claim filed by the indenture trustee, and also we
souqiit

lo

have the -indenture trustee file an accounting so that

we could then counterclaim; and all three of our rights to do
so were denied by the courts below.
Wa are allowed, however, under the ruling of all the
courts? below to set up as an affirmative defense to the
indenture trustee’s proof of claim this affirmative defense

13
that the indenture trustee was guilty of gross negligence or
wilful misconduct.
So we have to find the same facts on why we can't
bring it affirmatively, is one of the questions that is here
before this Court.
Mow, there are .two arguments which are raised by
Marine Midland in this case, which I would like to address my
attention to very briefly.
In the first argument Marine Midland tells the Court
about three individual cases which have been brought on behalf
of debenture holders, two in the State court in New York and
one in the Federal court in New York? and he says, in effects
You see, the debenture holders were represented in this case
and there's no need for this case.

What the trustee is

attempting to do is to preempt the debenture holders.
Now, the facts are, as we sat out in our reply
brief, that each of these actions was commenced after the
trustee, the reorganization trustee had filed a petition
seeking leave to bring this action, after he had ascertained
all the facts, and after Marine Midland had indeed
interposed an objection.
In fact, nothing has happened in any of those actio:
because they are all sort of sitting there waiting for the
result of this Court in this action, and because Marine has
moved to dismiss them on the grounds that there is no class

14
action as a matter of right under New York law for debenture
holders», a holding of the Appellate division of the First
Department in New York, which appears to still be the law,
although the question is now on appeal»
Q

Wouldn’t —-

Rule 23 govern it?

In that it’s a class action?

MR. MILLER;
Justice Stewart,

in the Federal court wouldn’t

Yes, I think Rule 23 would govern, Mr,

But I think that the question is not, as

Marine Midland has attempted to frame it, whether the trustee
is preempting the individual rights of debenture holders,
Thera has been no such claim here by the trustee or, as I
understand it, by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
And the argument I was addressing myself to was the
one of exclusivity or preemption.

We’re not saying that if a

debenture holder wants to bring his own action he may not do
so.

The matters may then be consolidated before the district

court, or they may not be.
):

'

• .V

What I'm talking about, and what this case is about,
is the pure issue of standing, whether the reorganisation trustee
can. bring the case.
Q

Would the only basis of federal jurisdiction in

an individual debenture, over his action, be diversity?
that bs the only way he could get into federal court?
MR. MILLERg
Ho ■*»-

Yes, 1 believe it would.

fould

IS
Q

2 believe that goes to the question of ~—

ME-.,, MILLER:

-- as was brought out, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, there is a —
Q

Under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, couldn't

ha?
MR. MILLER: Trust Indenture Act of 1939, Section 2IS.
which Judge Friendly in the Second Circuit alluded to in a
footnote in his opinion, saying, Yes, there is a private right
of action under 315.
Now, what we are saying, however, is that as a
practical matter and as a.matter of the statutory purpose,
there was a feeling in Congress that denture holders would
not have the wherewithal or the ability to bring this kind of
action, and the reorganisation trustee is the proper party to
do it.
Now, one other argument that has bean raised by
Marine Midland, to which I would like to address myself, is
the Marine Midland argument that you go down, the statute,
Chapter X, and you read it line by line by line and nowhere
do you see any specific authority for reorganisation trustee
to sue an indenture trustee on behalf of debenture holders.
Now, Marine Midland would have this Court look at a,
reorganisation trustee, and I think that this, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, is in part answer to your question, not as Marine
Midland would have us look to a reorganisation trustee as a

.16
liquidator or assets, somebody who goes out, looks at the
statute as though it?o a checklist and goes out and gets what­
ever property is involved there and brings what suits are
specifically set forth there.

'That is not, we say, what a

reorganisation trustee is all about.

hno, 1 thin iv that Judge Irving Kaufman in the-Court
0i &PP®als for the Second Circuit has said it better than I’m

t.o say

He said that the process of reorganizing ——

and r'm reading now from the dissent in the Court of Appeals
at pages 99a through 1.00a of the Appendix in this cases
!-i’he process of reorganising is not performed merely by a nice,
sharp, precise and mathematical apportionment of a debtor's
estate according to fixed formulas.

Rather, the objective is

carried out through’.a process of negotiation, and some giveand-tak©„ in an attempt to adjust equitably and with sensitivity
to the nuances of the individual case the rights of competing
Interested parties."
i-Uid then Judge Kaufman pointed to the language which
was e little more terse, as it usually was, of Judge Learned
xn x;ae Second Circuit, in his quite vigorous dissent in
e&;-’U, wiuh which we are in wholehearted agreement.
Judge Learnec LxM said the reorganisation court lias jurisdic­
tion because it has an obligation to “adjust the mutual
rights of the debtor’s creditors as between themselves.”
Kow, we think that the efforts of Marine Midland

17
to superimpose this State law property concept over what
Congress has enacted as the policy in reorganization, and should
be the policy in reorganization, is one which this Court should
not countenance.

Vie say further that if you’re looking to the statute
for specific statutory authority, that a reorganization
trustee has all of the powers of a receiver in equity.
Q

Mr. Miller.

MR. MILLER:
Q

Y©s, sir.

You referred earlier in your argument and in

your brief to 11 U.S.C. 587, which in turn, as 1 understand it,
refers to Section 44 of the Bankruptcy Act, and Section 44 of
the Bankruptcy Act provides for the appointment of a. trustee
in an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding? and as I read 58? it
says the trustee under this Act shall have the same power as
a trustee under the Bankruptcy Act.
How, if a trustee under the Bankruptcy Act couldn’t
bring this action, won’t you have to go to some other
statutory authority to show that your reorganization trustee
can do it?
MR, MILLER: Well, what we are saying, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, is that the second injunctive portion of that
Section 587 *»*»
Q

Where is this in the documents before us?

MR. MILLER: This is at page 35 of our main brief,

at Appendix A.
Q

Thank you,

HR, MILLER: That's the language that reads;

"and, if

authorized by the judge, shall have and may exercise such
additional rights and powers as a receiver in equity would
have if appointed by a court of the United States for the
property of the debtor.”
And we say that a receiver in equity, with the
Gase» could have brought this action, and that we
Gan 1 too, because v?e have the same powers as a receiver in
equity,
w

tui, that provision talks about the powers over

th® Property of the debtor.

And 1 take it you don't think

you should have to prove that this promise of Marine Midland
was property of the debtor?
•

Ho, I believe that the property concept

Mr. Justice White, does not have a place here.

1 think that

in ~~

0

But that's what th© statute says, though, Isn*
*'

it?
,dK* mILLERs

Well, before this statute was enacted,

ch.i-j Court, in the McCandless case, gave a receiver the power,
'ul'

receiver the power to go after assets from a third

party, which had not been property of the debtor, but in fact
was e diminution in the value of the debtor caused by wrongdoing

19
on the part of the

of insiders.

It was# in effect# the

equivalent of an insider wrongdoing.
And I say that the property concept is not a concept
which should control in this Court.
Nor should the concept of whether or not there
happens to foe a class action that was brought here.

We're

not talking about this case, alone, before this Court# we’re
talking about the general powers and the general authority
and the general standing of a reorganisation trustee.
knew there are limits upon that.

We

The limits upon.that are

that the matter must have a significant relationship to the
reorganization proceeding, and we think it clearly does here.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Miller.
Mr. Ferber.
ORIX. ARGUMENT OF DAVID FERBER, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF SECURITIES S EXCHANGE COMMISSION
MR. FERBER;
Chapter

'K

Mr. Chief Justice? if the Court please

of the Bankruptcy Act is one of the series

of securities laws passed during and right after the Great
Depression, to protect the investing public.
The Commission's study which led to it and to the
Trust Indenture Act showed that in earlier reorganisations,
generally in equity' receiverships, the investors' interests
{
were often sacrificed to the interests of the insiders.

Throughout and after the reorganisation, it was the
insiders who were usually in control and stayed in control,
and the persons who may have been responsible for the
difficulties that were encountered were rarely if ever sued*
The S2C concluded its study with the recommendation
to curb, and I quota, "the exploitation of investors which ha
occurred, either at the hands of the indenture trustee itself
or at the hands of the reorganization and management groups
with the knowledge, consent, or acquiescence of a complacent
and inactive trustee, indenture trustee."
And, as this Court has pointed out with respect to
others of the securities laws, we submit that Chapter X too
should be construed in the language of this Court not
technically and restrictively but rather flexibly, to effectu
ate its remedial purpose.
Now, what was the remedial purpose of Chapter X?
Essentially it was to provide a means for corporate
rehabilitation that would insure that investor's losses would
be kept to a minimum, and that the insiders, if responsible,
would be prosecuted and investors would be treated fairly.
The disinterested trustee, the court’s own officer,
was basic to the statutory design.

The House Report pointed

out that his functions, and I quote, "in the larger eases are
difficult to overemphasise.°
Under Section 167 of the Act,

he is to conduct

2:;.
an investigation to determine whether goincj-concem values
can be preserved by a reorganisation, and to determine what
caused the difficulties, and whether new management should be
required, and what causes of action ar© available to the
estate.
Mow, the respondent's brief makes quite a bit of
this, that its cause of action is available to the estate in
Section IS?.
I'd like to point out that this is not as clear a
word as the respondent suggests.

£fc doesn't say what

causes of action are available to the debtor, which is defined
in the Act, but uses the fairly vague word to the estate? and
we suggest that this word can encompass the investors who are
interested in the debtor.
The legislative history makes clear that a Chapter
X debtor was to bo viewed not just as a corporate entity but
as a collection of the interests of security holders.
In a sense, the Chapter X trustee represents all of
these security holders, even when there is classes of them
having somewhat conflicting interests.

When he works out a

reorganisation plan that is to be fair to all, obviously,
x

what one group might consider fair to it another group might
consider it less than fair to it, because there is only so
much normally to go around.
When he brings an action on behalf of the estate,

22
meaning strictly the debtor, it may help one class at possible
expense to the other.
On© of the landmark cases is Do^mmitl^ee, v. Kent in the
Central States reorganisation, where the Chapter X trustee
wanted to — determined that while there was a cause of action
against some of the promoters, he felt the statute of
limitations had run and therefore recommended that an action
not be brought.

On appeal it was determined that an action

should be brought despite the fact that the senior creditors
opposed it, because, as they said, you're going to use some of
what would otherwise, go to us to gamble for the benefit of
juniors.
But the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in
Committee v. Kent, said that this is the basic fluty of the
Chapter X trustee where it’s a comparatively small amount of
money as against what might be recovered to collect these
assets and determine that the lawsuit should be brought.
Similarly, as was made clear to this Court a couple
of years ago in the TMT case, Protective Committee v. Anderson,
there were settlements involved of large claims.

And these

settlements were of ouch a nature that, in effect, they were
wiping out the junior classi whereas — and this Court reversed
partly because of that, 1 believe, that there had not been an
ample determination on the fairness of these settlements which,
...if settled at the substantial prices the. debtor was allowing

-n

<<* o

them, would have pretty ranch wiped out the stockholders»
Kow, there are various safeguards in Chapter X for
all of the investors? creditors and stockholders are entitled
to be hoard at every stage of the proceeding.

They could have

come in, 1 don’t know whether they did or not , in this case
when the trustee asked leave to sue,
%3ut certainly there was no reason why any creditor,
any debenture holder, who felt that the trustee should not be
suing on his behalf could not have corns in and raised that
question.

They are represented by committees in many cases,

and also in many cases by the indenture trustee.
Chapter X court has very specific powers over these
security holders’ representatives.

It may enforce an

accounting under a trust indenture, or with respect to
security holders' committee•

It allows compensation for

,

services performed during the proceeding by indenture
trustees, and by committees.
And to us it seems that it makes a great deal of
sense to have the Chapter X trustee, who has investigated and
found out the facts indicating that the indenture trustee
might be liable, and who would use those, facts as a defense
against the indenture trustee's claim for services, against
the debtor, for him to bring the proceeding on behalf of the
debenture holders.

Q

Well, if the trustee were allowed to sue and

24
recovered the full face amount of the debentures from Midland,
would

and assume, for the moment, that that entire recovery

would go to the debenture holders, would other creditors then
get more than they would get now?
MR. FERBER: Well, Judge Friendly states that Marine
Midland would then bo subrogated —
Q

If they were not subrogated, well, obviously,

they would get more?
MR. FERBERi Without question.
But if there were subrogation, presumably it would
not directly benefit the other creditors, but there might be
the indirect consequences of working out an over-all reorganisa­
tion, that were mentioned.
Q

Well, now, let's go back a step.

Why is it. that

a recovery against Marine Midland would necessarily go to the
debenture holders exclusively?
MR. FER'iRRs

Well, I think that basically the contract

was between the indenture trustee, or the debtor was a party
to the contract, but it waa for the benefit of the debenture
holders.

The convenants that Marine Midland is alleged to

have violated were for the benefit of the people who were
buying the debentures.
Q

And for that you say solely, that's for their

sole benefit?
MR. FERBERs

I think without question that that was

23
the purpose of them.

Mow, when you gat to ~~ and I'm not

suggesting that anyone else* would have a claim against Marine
Midland, but from the standpoint of subrogation, which is an
equitable remedy, 1 can see where there could be circumstances
perhaps where other people might say, We relied upon Marine
Midland not to let these assets get out of 2 to 1 ratio, and
therefore it’s not fair that they be to share with us with
what's left in a matter of subrogation,
I'm not urging that, I'm saying there is a
question,
Q

That's not the claim here — this case is

submitted on the assumption that any recovery against Marine
Midland would go exclusively to the debenture holders?
MR, FERBERs

Q

Yes,

Mr. Ferber, in the McCandloss case,

which you

as well as the petitioner rely on, there had actually been a
depletion of the assets of the debtor, as that was the conduct
sued on there, had there?
MR, FERBER:
sensa, perhaps.

Well, if you look at it in a very broad

As 1 understand the facts in that case,

the promoters sold property to the debtor at a great deal
i©ss ~~ 1 msan at a great deal more than .it was probably worth.

’Z'h&y had what appears to ba a phony assessment, and the promoters
received these bonds, which they in turn sold to the public?
but the money coming to the bonds, I don't believe directly

r:6
ever went to the debtor.

So 1 think, while Judge Cardoso
-*!

loosely spoke of it as property of the debtor? as a practical
matter it was the profits of these proraters in the sale of
bonds that they had taken for their sale of property to the
debtor.
How, I rosy be oversimplifying, but X read it again
last night, the facts are not easy, but this is the way X
believe what is really involved, that the promoters would have
urged it was their property, and not property of the debtor.
/hid there, of course, the Court did hold that the
creditors

that the receiver could sue on behalf of the

creditors,

tod in that connection, Justice White, 1 think that

in the statutory language you read a bit ago, 1 believe there
were only identifying the person.
In other words, I don't think the language -of the
property of the debtor was intended in any way to be restrictive
of —
0

You hope? yes.

MR. FERBER:
Q

This is the way X read it.

Yes.

MR. FERBERs

tod X think it?s a very logical way to

mad it, I mean this is what the trustee was identified as,
or receiver was identified as.
Q

In addition to the Clarke case, in the Second

Circuit, there is the Manhattan Company v. Kelhy

MR. FERBERs

Yes.

a couple of years later? decided unanimously

Q

with Judge Jerome Prank writing the opinion.
MR. FERBER:
Q

Yes, sir.

That, too, is against you, isn’t, it?

MR. FERBER:

No.

I believe that case — well, there

may have been some language that made it clear that in that
ease they felt they were collecting the res,--

but, as I

recall, that case did — did not turn down any action on the
part of the indenture trustee,

Q

However, we

MR. FERBERs
tion*

I may be wrong, but that8s my recollec­

While even Learned Hand in the later cases, X mean to

persuade his brethren perhaps, always attempted to find a

:c&s, even though ho had said in the earlier case it wasn’t
necessary.
But 1 —
Q

But he didn ' t carry the day in £>rud©nga~Bonds,

that it was the res.

MR. FERBER?
Q

In the Prudence case —

And those war© bonds, they wars not debentures,

HR. FERBER2 That’s right.
0

That’s the difference in bonds or property

pledged or secured» in debentures all you have is covenants.
That's the difference between' the two.

MR. FERBER*

But,- as a practical matter, in the Solar

case, for example, among certain of the property' that got away,
aa it were, was when the Chicago plant of Solar had boon sold,
and the indenture trustee took the money and then put it into
the debtor's general account, and let the debtor got rii of it.
Now, getting back this money was, it

to me,

no different in essence than the funds, the assets that got
away here, because the indenture trustee did not enforce its
covenant.
Q

Well, but did any assets get away here?

1 mean,

isn't your claim against the indenture trustee just that he
didn't recognise-the fraudulent representations of the debtor
when they were made?
MR. FERBER: Wall, the claim is made in the complaint
that by reason of this, the debtor's assets ultimately were
dissipated, and that this is what forced the debtor into
receivership.
Q

But the debtor's assets were dissipated by the

debtor,
MR. FERBER:

Just as in the Solar case, Your Honor,

t.ce debtor's assets were dissipated by the debtor when the
Marine Midland — the same defendant, by the way

let the

debtor have the use of them.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. FERBER:

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Ferber.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Dickey.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. DICKEY, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DICKEY:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Court:
I’d like to clear away at the outset one or two
questions that I think are left open by what's gone before.
First, it is said that Mr. Caplin found about Marine Midland’s
performance that it had been grossly negligent, wilfully
guilty of misconduct.

What is being said simply is that Mr,

Caplin is alleging that in the complaint; nothing has been
proved, no evidence has been taken, no discovery has been
commenced.

There has been no answer in this case.

We are

here purely and simply on the question of whether the trustee
has standing to allege the claims that are set forth in his
complaint here.
There is no claim made on behalf of the estate,
nothing recovered, admittedly, by the commission admittedly,
by the petitioner admittedly, will accrue to the benefit of
the estate of Webb & Knapp.
There is no claim made here under the £rusi
Indenture Act.

It is not mentioned in the complaint, and

there is no reliance upon it, and jurisdiction is not invoked
on that basis.
This is purely and simply a damage suit alleging

30
negligence against Marine Midland under State law concepts of
negligence., claiming that we should have recognized the
falsity of certificates duly filed with us, pursuant to the
provisions of the indenture and relied on them, as we were
entitled to do under the terms of the indenture which, in turn,
was a qualified indenture under the Trust Indenture Act.
Q

Well, I understand that it's conceded, at least,

here that the trust indenture qualified
. -

that this trust

v

indenture qualified the 1938-39 Act, -~
MR. DICKEYs
Q

Yes, Your Honor? that's correct.

and that's your point.

But are you further

saying that the bondholders themselves could not rely on the
Trust Indenture Act —
MR. DICKEY;
Q

I'm not saying ~-

— for federal jurisdiction?

MR. DICKEY;

No, Your Honor, I'm not saying that.

Indeed, the fact of the matter is that, the Lewis action,
portions of the complaint of which are set forth in the
Appendix to our brief, is an action which not only is based
on, or purports to be based on the Trust Indenture Act, that
an issue that is presently before the district court in the
Southern District of New York on a motion by that plaintiff i?
behalf of his class of debenture holders, to assert a claim
under the Trust Indenture Act by amending his complaint to
include such a claim.

31
Thus frar federal jurisdiction has been invoked by
that plaintiff and by that class of denture holders which
includes . all past and present holders and purchasers, a broader
class than we*re talking about here? the jurisdiction in the
Federal court there is invoked under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, alleging violations of XOh-5.
Q

X thought somewhere in the course of Judge

Friendly's opinion in this case he suggested, by way of
perhaps casual dictum, that debenture holders could rel
the ~ MR. DICKEY:

He dees suggest, Your Honor, in a

footnote in his opinion; he states that under Section 315 of
the Trust Indenture Act it conceivably may be that a claim
will lie in behalf of debenture holders; but that's at page
90 —* X beg your pardon?
Q

But he specifically refrains from deciding it?

MR. DICKEY;

That is correct. Your Honor.

That's at

page 32 of the Joint Appendix, Your Honor.
Now, there's one other point before looking at the
statute which, in. the end, is the text upon which I suggest
this case might be decided.
It has been said that the answer to one of the

quoEfcsosii was O.at ft a creditors, might get more if there were
a recovery here, if the doctrine of subrogation were not
applicable.

32
Now, Judge Friendly expounds the doctrina of
subrogation, and we think he’s correct in his analysis# and
we have set forth additional support for that basis , for that
position in our brief.

But the actual fact in this case is

that the question is altogether moot, nobody is going to benefit#
other than the debenture holders# in this particular case#
because# as this case stands# a plan of reorganisation has
already been proposed# has been approved by the SEC# has bean
submitted to Judge McLean in the Southern District of New
York.

And in that plan of reorganisation there is provision

for the debenture holder to share equally as part of the same
class with the general unsecured creditors, share and share
alike.
And the Securities Exchange Commission, in their
comments upon the plan of reorganization which was submitted
to them for their consideration, had only minor modifications
t , suggest? and here is the modification:

that in the interest

of full disclosure to all the interested parties in this
reorganization proceeding, the plan of reorganization should
make absolutely clear that unlike the other claims and causes
of action, which the trustee is reserving and may prosecute
hereafter, any fund that may be recovered by the trustee in
the Caplin and Marine Midland litigation will inure solely
to the benefit of the debenture holders.
That * s conceded? that's the end of it, so far as any

33
further benefit# we suggest * to the estate of the debtor or to
anyone who may have any share or claim in it.
Q

Well, let’s assume that the payoff to the

debenture holders of unsecured credit is ten cents on the
dollar, and the claim against Midland produces 100 percent.
Or are you suggesting that no more could be recovered from
Midland than 90 percent?
MR. DICKEY;

That is what I am suggesting, Your

Honor.
Q

Unless •— that would be true only if you’re

right on the subrogation point?
MR, DICKEYt

No, it would not be true only if we’re*

right on the subrogation point, Your Honor,

The fact of the

matter is that I suggest damages cannot be measured in behalf
of the debenture holders.

Their claim against Marine Midland

cannot be measured and the limits of it established until they
have received a distribution within the plan of reorganisation.
This has been suggested, this is not brand new.
Augustus Hand, in the majority opinion in C1 ark& vs. Chase, f
which is the basic case, points this cut, and it’s followed
by the Second Circuit in this case.
Q

1 suppose it depends on where you start the

cause of action, even though it might inure to the debentur®
holders, the cause of action is viewed as the cause of action
of the estate for fcoing deprived of the ability to pay its

34
debtst and you com® out in a different way,
MR, DICKEY:

But, Your Honor, there’s no claim

asserted to that end in this complaint,

I suggest there could

not be, for that matter.
Now, let’s look at the statute —
Q

If there were such a claim, would they fce

limited to the amount of the debentures necessarily?
MR, DICKEYs

Your Honor, I think we wouldn't be

here if a claim had been asserted in behalf of Webb & Knapp,
claiming that Marine Midland was, and by its alleged dereliction,
was in a causal relationship with the insolvency of Webb &
Knapp,

We would not be her® on a standing point, at least.

We might very well be here eventually on the?, question of
whether any such cause of action will lie, whether there was
any duty owed by Marine Midland, the indenture trustee, to
the debtor which deceived it along with the debenture holders.
I think we would be here with the Court's permission or, that
point.

But not on standing; no, 'Your Honor.
Now, the statute, if the Court please, because that

is the basis of the trustee’s power.
Q

But, are you suggesting that in a plan of

reorganisation if — let's assume for the moment that before
the plan became final 100 cents on the dollar had been recovered
from Marins Midland.
MR. DICKEY:

I don't think it could have been

recovered from Marins Midland, because there would, be no
measure of damages.
Q

But you don't — you think that the reorganisa­

tion court would have no power to say that the debenture
holders must, as long as they could, recover 100 cents on the
dollar from Marine Midland, so that other creditors would?
MR. DICKEY;
Your Honor.

I think that that is absolutely correct,

New, the fact of the matter is that those are

unsecured debentures.

The debenture holders bought these,

looking to the credit of Webb 6 Knapp.

There's no security,

no mortgages, no anything that we hold can be —
Q

That's secured, in the bond, isn't it?

MR. DICKEY:

That's what it is. Your Honor, a

debenture, and therefore
Q

An unsecured indebtedness, secured only by

covenants.
MR. DICKEY:
credit of Webb

t>,

Yes, Your Honor.

And they look to the

Knapp, and the value, any value that these

debentures may have is a value measured by the ability of
Webb £ Knapp to pay them off when the time comas to pay them

off.
Nov?. let's assume this, Your Honor:

let's suppose

that in the reorganisation we're lucky and it's determined
that the distribution is not going to be ten cents on the
dollar, as Mr. Justice White hypothesizes, but 100 percent

36
on the dollar.

Let's suppose there's enough recovered to take

care of all the general unsecured creditors, including the
debenture holders, no damages have been sustained by the
debenture holders, no claim would lie against Marine Midland,
notwithstanding a proved claim if it eventually were proved
that there had. been a dereliction of a duty,
Q

Now, here there has been a plan, hasn't there!

MR. DICKEYs That is correct, Your Honor.

It has

not been approved by the court yet? but it is before the court,
after having been submitted to —
Q

Before the court for four cents on the dollar?

MR. DICKEY:

That is correct, Your Honor,

Thus I

suggest that the measure of damages that can be asserted
against Marina Midland is 96 cents on the dollar.
Q

And whether or not Marine Midland would be

subrogated is not an issue in this case?
ME.DICKEY:
a secondary point.

Not on issue, X suggest.

X think it's

2 think it can be made, and I think it's

correct? but we don't rely on it. We rely on the measure of
damac;e s po in fc,
Now, if Your Honor please — the Court please *•*>
Q

Is that the approach to the court below?

MS, DICKEY3
Q

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?

Id that the rationale of the court below?

MR. DICKEY:

Your Honor, it is.

Both points are

37

made,,

Tha subrogation point that Judge Friendly goes on to

say -Q

That .isn't your point?

MR, DICKEY: That is correct. The subrogation
point is made there, end# in addition, Judge Friendly goes on
and says:

even more importantly, we do not see the answer to

the statement made by Judge Augustus Hand in Clarke v. Chase?
in which he made the argument that I have just mads to the
Court.
We think, if the Court please, th<at the fundamental
and dispositive fact here is that there is no power granted
under the Chandler Act of the kind claimed hare by the Chapter
X trustee.

There is no provision in tha Chandler Act, we

suggest, upon which any implication can be fairly based, that
the Congress intended any such power.
The trustee is the creature of the statute.

The.

statute is meticulously drawn? meticulously drawn with respect
to the rights and the powers and tha duties, and specifically
with respect to the powers and duties of a Chapter X trustee
in enforcing and prosecuting causes of action.
Under the statute the trustee succeeds to the title
oftha debtor’s estate, and by Section 70 of the Bankruptcy Act
having taken title of the debtor to quote property of the
debtor, the section goes on to define in fine, detail what
property means, and specifically to define in fine detail what

38
property means in the context of causes of action to which the
trustee falls, uhder which he takes title.
And in Section 70 of the Bankruptcy Act this is
how it*s defined with respect to causas of action:

he takes

title to rights of action "which prior to the filing of the
petition the debtor could by any means have transferred or
which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial
process against him, or otherwise seised, impounded, or
sequestered", and in the following subparagraph, "rights of
action arising upon contracts, or usury,or the unlawful taking
or detention of or injury to the debtor's property"; everything
I

4

is focused on property.
Section IS? empowers the trustee to investigate the
acts and the conduct and the property and the liabilities
and the financial condition of, quote, "the debtor" in the
desirability of continuing the business.

And any other matter

relevant to the reorganization proceeding, or to the formulation
of a plan.

And then he's empowered to report that, directed,

indeed, to report that to the judge.
With respect to causes of action, he is directed to
"report to the judge any facts ascertained by him pertaining
to causes of action available to the estate".

Now, these

provisions are clear and unambiguous.
Q

Assume there's an appraiser that appraises some

property for the debtor and negligently or for some other

39
reason, some strange reason, intentionally

inflates the value

unknown to the debtor, and the debtor is permitted or goes
ahead and issues twice as many debentures as they would have if
the right valtie had been assigned to it?
I suppose there would be a cause of action by the
debtor against the appraiser?
MR. DICKEY:-

Only if damage could be shown to have

accrued against the debtor.
Q

Wall, he says, "We issued too many debentures,

and now we’re broke."
MR. DICKEY:

I think there would be a cause of

action, but it would be a cause of action in behalf of the
estate, and for the recovery of damages which would accrue to
the benefit of the estate, and therefore be available to be
shared among debenture holders, general unsecured creditors,
and everybody else.
Q

The stockholders, indeed, also.

They're no more broke after they issue too

many debentures than they were before they issued them, were
they?
MR. DICKEY:

It would be a damage suit, Your Honor.

They would have to show some kind of damage.

I don't know

the measure of damages would be the amount of the debentures
that they had issued, no.
Q
all?

Well, would that be any wrong to the issuer at

40
It would be unreasonable,, wouldn't it?
MR. DICKEY:
0

But it gets money for the debenture.

MR. DICKEY:
Q

2 think Your Honor's right.

2 beg your pardon?

It gets money — it got money for the debenture.

MR. DICKEY:

It really didn't get money for the

debenture holders, the debenture holders simply are left
holding debentures which are unsupported by property.
Q

That’s right? that's right,
But the debtor isn't hurt.

MR. DICKEY:
Q

Right, Your Honor,

In my brother White's hypothetical case, you

could show a situation where the debtor was hurt, if they
got a negligent appraisal and than made some sort of a corporate
decision based — clearly based on that appraisal, that —
MR. DICKEY:
q

Yes, Your Honor.

«■» could cause damages.

If they could prove

that, there would be a causa of action, by the corporation and'
therefore by the trustee under Chapter X.

MR. DICKEY:
Q

Correct, Your Honor.

It would be a matter of proving damages»'

MR. DICKEY:

1 think that's right.

And tha proceeds of that action would be available
to the estate, would accrue to the estate.
Q

Right.

MR. DICKEY; And it’3 a cans» of action which, in the
tersas of the statute, could be transferred to be levied upon,
et cetera.
Much reliance is placed here upon legislative
history or, I should say, purported legislative history.

But

I suggest to the Court that in the first place the statute is
clear and there is no occasion to look to it; and in the
second place, on its face the legislative history which is
cited in the briefs for the petitioner and for the Commission
here, shows that all of the talk about the intention of the
Congress to effect protection of public investors and to bring
about the appointment of an independent trustee for the
purpose of the protection of public investors, everything
that want into the eventual recommendations which led to the
Chandler Act are all pointed toward the participation of the
independent trustee within the reorganization proceedings,
not at any point is there any testimony by any witness, nothing
in any report of either House of Congress or any committee;
nothing in any of the sources which pass for legislative
history here, in which there is any suggestion that anyone
even urged the power which is sought here today.
1 pass that at that point.

I think in summary

the Chandler Act was intended to provide protection for public
investors.: and to that end the Act created the office of the
independent trustee, and the trustee’s; function is to protect

them within the context and within the parameters of the
proceedings.

He’s obliged to collect the property of the

debtor, to preserve it, if possible to attempt to rehabilitate
the corporation.

In this case that has been determined to bs

impossible, and the plan of reorganisation here is nothing
more than a plan for orderly liquidation on a relatively
modest scale.
Q

The trustee's alleged conduct here resulted in

the release of a surety or of a guarantor of debentures, could
the trustee sue?
MS. DICKEY:

I think in those circumstances, if this

were a guarantee of a third party, Judge Learned Hand, in one
of the Prudence-Bonds cases, reached the conclusion that that
was property;he approached it on the basis of analyzing it as
property of the debtor, but he could —
Q

And yet it's just a — yet all it is is a promise

— a promise to pay the debentures.
MR. DICKEY; But it's a promise of a third party,
Your Honor, which, if drawn upon and used to pay the debentures,
to that extent enlarges the estate of the debtor, and that is
precisely the distinction he drew in the Prudence -Bonds’- trust

case.
Q

But it doesn't enlarge the estate of the debtor,

it just permits —
MR. DICKEY;

Itbe&rs a drain, if you will, Your Honor,

Q

— it permits the debentures to

54R. DICKEY:

he paid.

It permits the debentures to be paid

and
Q

If it'a a guarantor, he wouldn't'be guarantee.Inc­

any more than what is left after the assets of the est ate are*
depleted.
MR. DICKEY: Well, if Your Honor please, no. The
distinction drawn in that case, and I suggest
vinc-cron, is this:

st proner dis*-

that the two issues before the Court as to

standing in that case were the right or standing of the
trustee to state a claim against the indenture trustee for
letting a third party guarantee go, and in that case it was
determined that there was standing because had that security
in effect not been released, then the debentures would have
been paid from that and there would have been no claim by the
debenture holders against the debtor83 estate.
In contrast —
fvc least
MR. DICKEY2

that was the theory of that case?

Rt least that was the theory of that

case.

Q

Well, the debtor’s estate would have been

corraspondingly 1argar?
MICKEY;

Enlarged, or at least prevented from

being drained, Mr. Justice.
On the other hand, in the other side of that case,

where the question was standing to sue because of the release
by the indenture trustee, not of a third party's guarantee but
of a guarantee of the debtor itself, a distinction was drawn.
And it was found that there would be no effect on the debtor's
estate, and therefore standing would not .lie within the terms
of the Chandler Act.
Now, Your Honor, I will not go through the Second
Circuit cases, they've been discussed, they are fully briefed.
They have to be read.
X would like to move on to what X think is the real
vice that's inherent in the position that's advanced here by
the petitioner and by the Commission,

Because they are not

asking this Court simply to imply that the Chandler Act should
be interpreted in ouch a way as to permit a modest extension
of power on the part of the trustee, to assert this single
claim against Marine Midland in this particular ease.
What they are asking the Court to do, because they
can't rest on that simple point, is to imply numerous
decisions or conclusions as to numerous questions involving
other statutes and other rules in the class action in the
securities law field.
That is to say, that to sustain their position, this
Court or possibly the district court, maybe we have an agenda
for years of litigation before us here, if this position is
sustained? either this Court or the district court and then

,15

the courts of appeal and then v?e may ba back hers, are going
to have to make decisions, of necessity, of this kind.
They’re going to have to imply the answer to the
question whether or not the power claimed by the trustee is
exclusive or not exclusive.

X understand they do not claim

that it's exclusive, they claim that it’s preferred that the
trustee have this power.
They also say that as a practical matter, if they’re
granted this power, they will in fact sweep the field clean,
because other debenture holders, suing in their private
capacity, would not be inclined to risk the money and tha time
for what in the end prove to be a futile action if the trustee’
action in fact is permitted to be preferred and go forward.
If the conclusion is that the power is not exclusive,
and if the conclusion is that it is presumptively to be
preferred that the trustee prosecute this action, then 1 ask
what rule are we looking to, from what do we imply this kind
of a conclusion, what rule or statute is involved here?
And if the trustee’s power is implied not to be
exclusive and not even to be presumably and presumptively
preferred, but is just to run parallel with private actions
brought by class claimants, private debenture holders suing
in their own behalf, then where does that leave us with
respect to Rule 23 in the federal courts?

Where does it

leave us with respect to the confusion that 'would be caused

46

'

in delicate State-Federal relations, with respect to parallel
class action provisions under State law?
Think of the questions that have to foe answered once
we get into that area.

Who is to go forward first?

How are

we to determine th© priorities between the competing suitors?
the private litigants on the one hand, which we had to in this
case, and ase trustee on the other hand?
making that decision under Rule 23.

There's mechanics for

,

In the Southern District of New York there is practice
of staying a federal action in favor of a State action, often
to let it run its course and see how it will come out.
But these are things that are worked out and have
been, over the past 30 years, of class action litigation
under the securities lavs and otherwise, and under Rule 23,
but which suddenly are going to be thrown into chaos when the
trustee steps into the water and lends his weight here to this
kind of a claim.
What will we do with that collateral estoppel?
n-nat huppens?

2s it a race to judgment amongst these people,

and the first one gets there binds the others?

If the

debenture holders get the judgment first, does that bind the
trustee, and is the trustee's action out; in contrast, does
the trustee9s action take precedence?
Is the trustee's action subject to Rule 23?

There's

a suggestion in the brief that there is no reason to suppose

4?
that rules similar to Rule 23 will not ba invoked here to
govern this action. But which parts of that rule# X mean# in
the first place# Rule 23 can’t apply to the trustee# he doesn't
meet the first condition precedent, he's not a member of the
class.

And to apply Rule 23 to him, this Court would have

to decide that the framers of Rule 23# this Court in effect,
had intended that it read not that a member of the class may
sue representatively, but a member of the class# parenthesis#
and a Chapter X trustee if he so pleases, may assert such an

What do you do about collateral estoppel with

respect to — as among individual debenture holders who do
not bring class action?
MR. DICKEY:

Well, as the individual debenture holders#

they would not be collaterally estopped, X suggest, Your Honor,
under the operation of Rule 23, because of the opted out
provision of Rule 23.
Q

How about --

MR. DICKEYs
Q

Excuse me.

Just as among, let's say# the Individual

plaintiff who doesn't purport to bring a class action?
MR. DICKEY* We have such in this case.
o

And he loses# there's no collateral estoppel,

is there?
1-JR. DICKEY:

No# there's no —

Q

Or with respect to any other ~

MR. DICKEYs

No, no collateral estoppel in that case.

But here we have a trustee who purports to sue in behalf of
the whole class, or a very large part of it, at least; his
action is not as broad as the other two are.
Q

According to the argument, he’s suing as kind of

an ombudsman as in charge of all the confreres of interest
in the corporate reorganisation.

That's my understanding of it.

MR. DICKEYs

And 2 suggest, Your

That's right.

Honor, that his action is redundant, that it's unnecessary,
that in this case he's looking to an impoverished estate to
finance a litigation which need not bo brought because the
debenture holders are in both the STate court and the Federal
court asserting their claims vigorously.

Discovery has been

had in one of those oases. The case is further along than this
one. And the only reason it's not further is that the district
court, knowing of the grant of certiorari in this case, has
stayed the federal action to see what conclusions are reached
hero.
2 suggest, Your Honor, in conclusion, if the Court
please,, in conclusion, that we*re opening Pandora’s bos: once
via cross the initial bridge of accepting the argument that's
made here and the claim of standing.
Because wo have no answers to give to all the compita
of questions which then face us procedurally with respect to

49
collateral estoppel, with respect to res judicata, with
respect to priorities of claim, with respect to delicate
relations between the state governments and the federal
government and their respective rulings.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Dickey.

You have about four minutes left, Mr. Miller»
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES E. MILLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MXLLERs

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;
I suggest that the parade of horribles that Marin®
Midland has suggested that would be unleashed if the trustee
ware given standing in this case* just doesn't exist, and it
doesn't exist for one reason, and it's a reason that we assert
is one of the significant reasons why the trustee should have
standing in this case.
Everything in the reorganisation is under the
supervision and the umbrella and the aegis of a reorganization
court.

It's under the aegis of the reorganization court which

has the Securities and Exchange Commission before it every
ntep in the proceeding, before any action can be started the
reorganisation court gives permission to the starting of
the action.

Before any action can ba settled, the reorganisa­

tion court determines whether the settlement is fair and

50
equitable, and the reorganisation court which makes that
determination does it on the basis of a long-standing knowledge
of all the facts and circumstances of the debtor's estate, of
the debenture holders, of all the various packages of creditors*
rights which are involved here.
Q

You're not suggesting -that the individual

holder of the indenture has to sue in the reorganisation court?
He has to sua
MR. MILLER?

No, I am not.

No# I am not.

Now# in addition to that —
*

Q

In the Prudence case the individual securities

holders could have sued the indenture trustee?
MR. MILLER;
Q

If what# Mr. Justice White?

I'm sorry.

In the one Prudence case that held the trustee

could sue for release of the surety, —
MR. MILLER;
Q

Yes, that was —

— the individual holders could have sued too,

oouldn*t they?
MR. MILLER2
Q

Yes, I believe that they could have.

All right.

MR. MILLER: What you had in that case in furtherance
of your question to Mr. Dickey, or in further answer to it, I
think was nothing more than a chosen action, and I think you
have the same thing in this case, perhaps a different kind of
chosen action, but no different.

51

Q

But belonging to somaone else? that's the

problem.
ME. MXZiCjER; Well, no, it's belonging to the debenture
holders, and I think, if 1 stay, Mr. Justice Stewart, that's
not the problem.

That's what this case is all about*

The

focus in this case has come to be directed toward the estate,
and what is happening with the estate.

We are talking now

about the debenture holders, and. the debenture holders alone,
and whether they are entitled to this relief? and we are
seeking,the reorganisation trustee is seeking to mio on
behalf of the debenture holders.
In the Solar case and in the Clarke^ case and i~
Prudence-Bonds, all of those cases which are the only ones
which have decided this question, for the most part;

There

was recovery to the debenture holders on certain of the
claims allowed,'either whether there was a trust lease
involved or certain property involved.

There was no question

there about standing or effect on the estate or subrogation
or w'.ether there would be any of these other matters in the
parade of horribles which have been asserted before you*
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Miller.
Thank yon, gentleman.
The case is submitted.
