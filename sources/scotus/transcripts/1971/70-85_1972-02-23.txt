QR&Xi ARGUMENT OF EDGAR A* ZINGMAN, ESQ. »
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ZINGMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
We appear here in behalf of the petitioner, Paul
Branseburg, a professional journalist employed by the CourierJournal, a daily newspaper published in Louisville» Kentucky.
The petitioner seeks reversal on First and Fourteenth Amendmen
grounds of two cases decided by the Court of Appeals of
Kentucky *
In the first of these, involving the respondent Haye
a Judge in the Trial Court in Jefferson County, Kentucky,
following upon publication, in the Courier-Journal of an
article authored by the petitioner which described the
manufacture of hashish by two individuals in Louisville,
Kentucky, and which in the body of the article contained a
statement that a promise had been given by the petitioner that
the identity of the two individuals would be maintained
infciai

disc!

Tiro petitioner was subpoenaed before a grand jury
rittiag in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and was asked by that

grand jury two questions relating to the identity of the
parsons that ha had described in the newspaper article.

One

*

of the questions asked- him, specifically:
"On November 12, or 13, 1269, who was the person or
persons you observed in the possession of marijuana about
which you wrote an article in The Courier-Journal on November
15, 1969?“
The second question was':
"On Eoronber 12,- or 13/1969, who was the person or
persons you observed compounding’ marijuana, producing the same
to a compound known as hashish?”
This appears in our Appendix at page 6.
The petitioner refused to answer these questions and
was brought before the predecessor in office of the respondent
Bayes, a Trial badge by the name of Pound, and upon the
rueattons being real to the judge, the petitioner was directed
to answer the questions.
At that time wa appeared in behalf of the petitioner
and assarted First end Fourteenth Amendment grounds under
the concept of freedom of the press for the petitionerSs
refusal to answer the questions.
We also asserted the provisions of a Kentucky shield
statute, KBS, Kentucky Revised Statutes, 421„100, which is
?hrasc- S in language that protects a newsman from revealing the
rcvrco of v:ay information published by him.

5

The: twirl court rejected the contentions made on
bahrilx of the petitioner end various motions for writs of
prohibition and for stays mare made in the Kentucky Court of
Appeals.

The Kentucky- Court of Appeals granted a temporary

stay prohibiting the respondent's predecessor in office from
proceeding with contempt action against the petitioner until
such time as the Kentucky Court of Appeals had occasion to pass
on the merits of the case»
The case mas subsequently briefed and argued to the
Kentucky Court of Appeals on the First and Fourteenth Amendment
grounds., in addition to the provisions of the Kentucky shield
statute»
In November of 1970, the Kentucky Court of Appeals
delivered an opinion, in which the Kentucky Court of Appeals
held that the Kentucky shield statute did not protect the
petitioner? it held that the shield statute was restricted
solely to informants' information and protected the identity
of informants, but where the reporter or newsman observed at
•first-hand individuals engaged in a particular activity, which
might constitute a crime, or any activity, he was not privileged
be protect the individual, the identity of the individuals
themselves.
i. position which, it seems to us, would put a premium
second-hand reporting and second-land sources? somewhat
incongruous■>

6
Shortly after the Kentucky Court of Appeals opinion
was daliverad, a -petition for reconsideration was filed in the
Kentucky Court of tpuaalr, calling to that Court•s attention
the fact that they had made no comment upon our First and
Fourteenth hrasndjaent arguments, and citing to the Kentucky
Court of Appeals the decision of ihe Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals in Caldwell v. Palted States, the appeal of which was
argued before this Court yesterday.
While that was pending before the Kentucky Court of
Appeals, another article authored by the petitioner appeared
in the Courier-Journal, and this article dealt with the use
and sale of marijuana in the State Capitol buildings in
entucky, and the environs of the Capitol buildings
in Frankfort,
!%/;>£diate!y following the publication of this
article, the petitioner was subpoenased to appear before a
grand jury in Franklin County, Kentucky, and the subpoena
stated, quote, "to testify in the matter of violation of
statutes concerning the use and sale of drugs”.
A motion to quash this subpoena was made on First
and Fourteenth Aaienfesnt grounds, and the trial court, the
respondeat Meigs, entered an order which in effect overruled
the contentions we made, and directing the petitioner to
appear before the Franklin County Grand Jury-.
At that ti:--/-: we contended not only that the testimony

?
with relation to the article was privileged under the First
and Fourteenth Amendments, but we contended that the mere
appearance of tho petitioner under this subpoena was protected
against under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
The trial court having overruled us on this positionf
we appealed for relief to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which
had our petition for reconsideration in the first case still
pending before it.
The Kentucky Court of Appeals refused us the relief
which we had requested, entered a modified opinion in the
first ease, upon our petition for reconsideration which, in
essence, modified the first opinion by adding a footnote
contending that we had abandoned our First and Fourteenth
&r.endaftnt cl air,; in the argument in the Kentucky Court of
Appealst a position, which, I might say, 1 think was a
distortion of the record and which has not been urged in this
Court in the briefs.
Q

Mr. Singman,

MR. ZINGMAN:
Q

Yes, sir.

Judge Meigs did do more for your client than

Judge Pound had, did he not?
MR. %1NGMANi

Yes, sir.

Judge Meigs entered a four-

paragraph protective order which, in the first three paragraphs,
ft is modeled very much like the order Judge Zirpoli entered
in. tbe Caldwell ea«o, but then he took it all back in the

8
fourth paragraph,, because he said, notwithstanding anything
in the first three paragraphs, petitioner shall not bs
protected from disclosing anything concerning any crime he
has observed.
And of course the whole news article was about the
possession and sale of. marijuana, which is a misdemeanor under
Kentucky law.
Q

So it*s your position, then, that Judge Meigs'*

order was for practical purposes, the same thing as Judge
Pound's?
MR. ZXNGMAK:
Q

Yes, sir.

The newa article — there was only one, was

there?
MR. ZIMGMANs There were two articles.
Q

Wall, one appears on pages 3 to 5 of the

Appendix.
MR. ZINGMANs

Yes, sir.

And the other appears on

pages 30 to 42 of the Appendix.
Q

And the first one was published in the Louisville

Courier-Journal.
MR. ZINGMAN s Both were published in the —
Q

Both of them?

MR. ZXNGMM:

Both were published in the Louisville

Couricr-Journal.
Q

Yas, but one had a dateline, Frankfort; that

9

was the one beginning on page 30.
MR. xmmmt
Q

Yes, sir.

And the first one had a dateline — seemed to

be Lord svi 1 le ?
MR. ZINGMM'T:
Q

Is that right?

ME. %INGM&N:
Q

Louis'vi 1 le.

Yes, sir.

It doesn’t have a dateline, but it’s a local

story in the local paper,
MR. ZXNGMAN:

Yes, sir.

The Courier "-Journal is a

daily of general circulation throughout the State *
Q

‘dhrotighout the State, right,

ME. ZXNGMAN:

Following upon Judge Meigs’ action, as

1 stated, the Court of Appeals entered its opinion, modified
opinion in the Havas case, and denied us the relief we asked
in the Meigs case.

It subsequently followed this with an

opinion in the Meigs case, which is at present unreported, but
is set out in the Appendix at page 54.

And in substance, in

that opinion, they rejected ©Ur First and Fourteenth Amendment
arguments.

The;/ took the position that a newsman occupies no

position different from any other citizen in the community,
and they specifically rejected the holding of the Court of
tr

for the Hinth Circuit in the Caldwell decision.
seised for otays and engaged in various procedural
von to b It up action pending application for certiorari to

10
■■Ilis Court.

This -was denied, and, upon application, Mr. Justice

Stewart granted a temporary injunction staying any further
compulsion of contempt proceedings against the petitioner,
pending application for certiorari? and on May 3, 1371,,
certiorari was granted, and we are hare»
With the indulgence of the Court, 2 would first like
to -state the issue grad the proposition we urge, and then to
develop our argtrser-fcs in support of that proposition.

In the sense that these cases seek relief for a
neweman from compulsory testimony under certain circumstances,
they are ca&ss of first impression in this Court.

They are

hero, as was the. Caldwell case yesterday? and the Pappas case
which follows us, because of a distressingly increasing
practice of the entire criminal administration apparatus,
grand juries, prosecutors, investigators, to attempt to make
the- new3 media into an appendage of that apparatus by
compelling newsmen to give testimony relating to their
confidential sources and information.
Doctrin&lly, however, these are not cases of first
impression.

We are asking here only for that historical

protection against governmental interference? with exercise
of First Amsncteonfc rights, which this Court has always provided,
While the factual setting may be novel, these cases
plication here of this Court’s
1-cto.y.y

act-3 aft-repeatcd requirement that there is imposed

11
upon, the government the burden of demonstrating a compelling
and overriding need, and the lack of alternatives less
destructiva of Fiona .amendment rights before government inter­
ference with the erercise of First Amendment rights will foe
countenanced.
The -cals that we urge upon the Court is that the
freedom of the prees guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments encompasses not only publication but all meaningful
pre-conditions to publication, not the least of which is the
ability to gather or obtain information.

To insure these rights, we believe that it is necessary
for this Court to declare that the First Amendment protects the
newsman from being compelled to enter a closed proceeding and
from being compelled to disclose confidential information
obtained by him as a newsman, unless there has bean a prior
dsaionstrution by th& government, in an open hearing, of a
compelling ore overriding need for the disclosure.
::b,vg while we do not believe that the test of a
coswelling and overriding need can be or should foe precisely
defined, wa suggest that as a minimum the following consideratime should bo waived, but none alone, should be treated as
controlling.
Mr. Singmm, let me interrupt you there.
"viosiiri /, fe: ;■ would you is:fine a newsman?

In

$ow, Mr* Bramsfourg

h-are is: a ^viimir.e one, all right? I take it there's no question

12

about this,
tut it wee suggested in the argument yesterday that
beyond that one can get into a twilight gone.

MR, ZiNGMliNs

yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Firstly, let ma comment that the definition of a
newsman, as such, while us will offer one, should not be a
problem, as the Court will recall in the whole line of
litigation, starting with Sullivan v. The Hew York Times,

we

had to, and the Court had to deal with the definition o^ the

public official, and we moved from public official in Sullivan
with the footnote that the Court does not here define how far
this reaches in the government structure to public person, to
a parson of prominence, and so forth.
And this of course is what the courts are peculiarly
:i:d aptly fitted to do', and we submit that the same thing with

the newsman.
But, as a starting point, we would define a newsman
:.s any person who, on a continuous basis, is engaged in the
process of gathering information and preparing such information

for dissemination to the public.
That's a very simplistic definition, but we think it
■could be a good starting place within the traditional approach

of this Court.
Q

Of course we3re talking about the First Amendment.

raw First Amendment protects free speech as well as it does

13
a free press, does it not?
MR» ZINGMAE:
Q

Yes, sir.

And I suppose your argument, based as it is

upon the First Amendment, could not logically be confined to
newsmen, however defined.

2 suppose every one of us has the

— is protected in his right to free speech and the right to
speak also includes the right to keep silent.

And I suppose,

logically carried to its conclusion,, your argument would be
that anybody would be protected if he just said, "1 cion • t want
to talk”»
MR. ZINGMA&j Well, X wouldn’t know ~
Q

Why is it confined to newsmen?

We all have the

right of free speech, do we not?
MR. 2INGMAR:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

X would

not agree that logically carries to its conclusion every one
un er the exorcise of the grant of free speech would have the
right to refuse to testify,
Q

Why?

MR. ZXHGMA&’:

Well, specifically, we * re talking about

the press, which is also mentioned in the First Amendment.
Q

Well, they’re both there, are equally protected.

MR. ZXNGMAN:
Q

Yes, sir.

Free press and free speech.

MR. IXRGMAff % Ar;d the records in these cases demon**
strate ■ that, at least we foe.":

and we

Id urge upon the

14
tonrt, that the oompulsion of testimony by a newsman would
have: mi inhibiting effect upon the ability of the press to
fulfill its function.
Sow, vre know of no such record with respect to
compelling individuals to cocas before a grand jury and
testify generally in support of free speech,
Q

Wellf if you’re right„ it would be a direct

impingement upon a person's right of free speech, because the
right os free speech includes the right to keep silent,
does it not?
MR.
Q

zingmaa't

The right of free speech —

It’s not inhibiting, it’s just a direct violation

of it, if you’re right in your basic argument.
HR. ZXNGMASJ:

No, sir.

I don’t think the right of

free speech has ever been interpreted by this Court as
including the right to keep silent when called before a grand
jury.
Q

So, it never has, nor has this Court ever

interpreted the right of free press to include the right, of a
newspaperman to defy a subpoena of a grand jury. So we are —
these both would be new decisions.
MR. ZXNGMAN1

That is correct.

And our position is

that the record here amply demonstrates that it's a necessary
convomit ant of the First Amendment free press right to protect
’■■■; newsman, that the loss in not compelling testimony is so

little in tfcs balancing process chat we urge that the right
be protected»

If i follow pour hypothesis# if at soma future-

time a like demonstration is made that grand jury testimony fey
individuals haa a shilling affect upon the exercise of free
speech in our ~~
Q

lieli; it certainly does# particularly if it3r

anything told to an individual in confidence# it would have a
chilling effect on anybody who. wanted to confide in a friend
or an associate{ wouldn't it?
MR, ZiNGM&Ms Well# I don't knew whether it would or

not.

All I can assert

Q

Well# it's very clear that it would# isn’t it?

I mean if your argument is right # or even if your affidavit is
right,
MR, SXNGM&N:

No# because I don’t believe that in
‘1

the context of speech, there is the assurance that when .
confidences are given that they will not be disclosed as part
of .the' compulsory process of a grand jury) 'but what we're
urging here is that it is necessary to

the functioning of the

press, and it has been a part of the access of the press#
the U such confidence* bo given and those confidences are th®
condition upon tiaieii information is available to the public.
see the same demonstration in the. speech area
(}

fha First Amendment protests them both,

MR. SlKGMANs

yes# it

does.

16
and the Court has made a different balancing consider­
ation in different applications of the First Amendment.

Q

Well, let's suppose this reporter had been

accompanied by a member of the State Legislature/ who was
simply interested in informing himself in connection with,
perhaps, revisio

of the State criminal code.

He was also

accompanied by an interested parent; and he was also
accompanied by the head of the Criminal Law Revision Commission,
and they both sea? the same thing.

And you would say the

reporter would be privileged, and none of the others would?
MR.. ZXtfGMAN:

We would make that distinction, Mr.

Justice White, but, of course, in that case it would be meaning"»
less anyway because the information could be obtained from
others, which would and the guest.
Q

Wall, 18in saying —

MR. SXiSGMAN:
a

But ordinarily —

— we make the distinction.

Because

a ’re talking about freedom of the press and the necessity to

provide the information for the public.
that we emphasize.

It's not the newsman

The newsman is the mechanism.

But we are

emphasising the necessity for seeing to it that the flow of
Information to the public is maintained.
Q

'Jell, the interested parent and the head of the

Criminal Law Revision Commission says, We just can't get the
information to allow us to conduct our business? run our
Homilies and to run this committee, if we can't — aren't

all owed to respect confidences.
MR, SteGwtHs

My response to that would have to be

•ena t the framers of the Constitution didn’t put an amendment

in

for them and there is a First Amendment dealing with the press *

Q

Well; hut they are covered; as Mr. Justice

Stewart says, by the free speech provision•
MR. ZINGMAN: Well, insofar as the 'exercise of free
speech is concerned, I merely would be repeating myself in the
remarks I made in response to Mr. Justice Stewart.
Q

Yes»

MR. ZINGMAN; We draw a distinction there on the
demonstrations in the record and on the objectives that we are
urging.
Q

::'md I might ask you alsos

Do you say that the

newamo.n *s claim of privilege must automatically be respected
once he claims it?

Is there any investigation or any proof

required as to whether he received the information in
confidence, or must his assertion just be accepted?

MR. ZXNGMANs

Our formulation would call for the kind

of investigation in an open hearing that is made by courts
today when the fifth Amendment privilege is asserted.

That

dr, if, prima facie, the trial court determines that the plea
in being made in sincerity and good faith, that it is to be
honored.
Q

What do you think in this case, just as a

18
Pv&cti cal matte r, a Z'.:.;)crcer goes and sees what he says and
reports it? as a practical matterf why would the people that he

caw running thi s hashish laboratory permit him to publish the
fact that there was this laboratory operating,, but say, Please
don’t publish our names?
W-H. ilKGhM;; Well, this, Mr» Justice vihite, I think
goes to the heart of what we5 re talking about and why this is
so important.

There are dissident elements in the society

today which, for the first time historically,
are really dealing with.

the news media

Traditionally the news media,

historically, have reported what is going on in the general
community, the orthodox community.

But, more and more, through

investigative reporting, they are dealing with the unorthodox,
the rebellious, the youth, the drug culture, the hippies, the
dissidents.
Now, these people do want, to get their positions
across to the community at large, and it is important for the
community at large to understand their position.

There is

great controversy in this country today about, the question of
legalisation of marijuana.

It’s important for the public,in

determining that question, to understand the attitude of those
who use it.

Q

Shouldn’t the public have a right to know the

sources of that information?
him piogmmil: Well, I think the important thing is for

19
the public to have the right to know, and if having the right

to know the

sou:;gss

will destroy the ability to obtain the

information r then it leads us no place.
Q

isn't the public going to make its evaluation

of the information depending on the credibility of the source
and the possible sel "-interest of the source?
MR. £IKGMhNs

Well, that's part of it, and I suppose.-

in that quantum, the public will also weigh the fact that these
people wanted to remain unidentified.
But, obviously, if you9re going to print news about
what is presently an illegal activity, you are not going to get
information volr.ntr-.rily from those who are participating in
rueh activity if it's going to immediately lead to their
arrest and" prosecution.
How, it’s a question of cutting off the information
at the very start.
Q

Xiet me ask you a hypothetical question, to

pursue the point that both Justice Stewart and Justice White
have eubarked on.

Suppose in a particular community, not only

the law enforcement authorities ware apathetic but also the
press was apathetic, and some public-spirited citizens decided
to conduct their own investigation, and they went around and
did just what your investigative reporter did, and then used
•:Lv tima^honorad method of writing a letter to the Editor to do.
, jusr. what, your i;.vestrgati ve reporter did.

Is he pro-

20
tested?
MR. ZINGMAN:

Sot under the definition which I

offered Mr. Justice Biacksmn, 1 believe*, of what a newsman
because —

Q

Justice Stewart suggested that it’s a difficult

dis fcinction to make.
MR. SXNGMAN:

It is a difficult distinction, but one,

X think, that has to be made.

Q

If the reporter is protected and the citizen

who writes -the letter tc the Editor is not?
MR. ZXNGMAN:

In the application, with the definition

that we make, that would bs the case..

But, again, Mr. Chief

Justice, I must emphasise that we are not talking about
reporters qua reporters as against other individuals.

We are

talking about the flow of information protected by the First
Amendment for the benefit of the general public.
Q

Well, doesn't that standard precisely fit my

hypothetical public-spirited citizen who is trying to get the
flow of information that neither the law enforcement authorities
■.

the local press is delivering to the public?
MR. ZINGMAM: As exn abstract proposition it would.

I

might agree in a particular case.

Amendment talks about the press.
Q
Vicariously?

But here the First

It doesn't —

This man is using the press, isn't he?

21
MR. ZXNGMSM:

Yes? sir? but w® have to arrive at a.

definition, and for definitional purposes we have defined the
press as one who on a continuous basis does this? not a
volunteer.
Q

all, historically, in this country and in other

countries? particularly our own, beginning 200 years ago?
wasn't the Letter to the Editor a great means of
essayists,

used by

pamphleteers who communicated to the public in much

the way the columnists do today.

Were they any less —

Madison or Jefferson or any of these men any less exercising
the freedom of the press? because they did not get paid for
writing their Letters to the Editor?
MR. S.XNGMAN:

Well, I would concede that the

pamphleteer and such may, under the forumula
included in a particular case.

we make, be

There may have to be some

But, as a starting point, we believe

*

that in the tradition of this Court, going one step at a time,
that you start with a definition of the press along the lines
that I have suggested, and then wa move with experience from
there.
Q

Under your definition, you would not auto­

matically include all the authors of the Federalist Papers',
would you?
MR. f.XNGMANi Well» I*m not familiar with to what

Mr. gingman.

MR. siHGMau:
Q

Yes, sir»

Following up on this same line of questioning,

•x-ith which you have already been bsrraged, take the class of
people who speak moro or less formally as an occupation, of
vrhoiu 1 would think perhaps of college professors, lecturers.
Now, Justice Stewart suggested that, and I think he's quite
right, that the freedom of speech is every bit as much protected
as freedom of the press.

And here you have a class of people

that are more or less regularly exercising the freedom of
speech and not casually exercising it,.
Wouldn't your concept of the privilege at least have
to extend to this type of person?
MR,, Si .JGMANs

We are not prepared to urge that upon

the Court, because, again, while that may be a freedom of
speech problem, it is not a freedom of the press problem.
talking specifically about press.

We're

There are many elements in

the ccmunity that are engaged in the acquisition of knowledge
and. the dissemination of knowledge, but they’re not
constitutionally protected and constitutionally dealt with?
so we don't reach that problem,
\

Q

What about the research right of' books on

criminology?
MR. ZX3GM&H:

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I think

that that dosa not, it. oar judgment, fit in this constitutional
fraiaetork.
Q

MR» 2INGMAN:
Q

The author of a book isn’t covered?

MR. EXNGM&N:
Q

Yes.

Hot in that sense, no.

Well, in this case, your man witnessed a crime?

correct?
MR. ZXNGMAN:
3

Yes, sir.

Suppose that instead of making hashish they were

:• asking a bomb to blow up the Capitol in Frankfort, would the
privilege still apply?
MR. ZINGM&N:

Q

Well, at the —

1 just wanted to know how far you’d go with this

crime.
MR. 3XNGM&N:

At the time the questioning by the

Justices of the Court started, I was at the point off stating to
the Court the standards that we would apply.

And the third

standard that I have to offer, if 1 may, will respond to your
question.
We have aaid that there must be a test off compelling
ane overwhelming need demonstrated by the government for the
infer-ration. An... I was starting to say that while we did not
relievo it it aid be or should be precisely defined, that, as a

minimum, the following three considerationsnone alone of
which we won Id considar be controlling , should be applied;
First, that there is probable cause that the newsman
has specific information relative to a specific permissible
inquiry*
Second, that there are no alternative means less
destructive of First Amendment rights by which to obtain the
information.
And third, and this is in answer to your question,
Mr. Justice Marshall, that the newsman's appearance and
testimony is necessary to prevent direct, immediate, and
irreparable

ve damage to national security, human

life, or liberty.
And, in terms of the third consideration, we would
say a Court could waive and compel the testimony.
Q

Kell, suppose they were making a bomb to blow

up John Doakes, an ordinary citiaen.

That wouldn’t be covered,

would it?
MR. ZINGMAN:

Yes, it would, in terms of my third

criteria.
Q

Well, I thought you said that would be something

of national importance.
MR. 2XNGMANs
Q .
Doakes?

National security ~~

What5s national importance about killing Joe

25
MR» 21KGMANs

Rational security, human life, or

liberty»
Q

Well, then

MR. KINGMANt

or liberty?

Yes, sir.

Human life or liberty.

So,

in the case you posit, which is, in substance, 1 would suppose,
the Knopgcase, in which —
Q

My whole problem is, crimes are crimet are they

not?
MR. ZINGMAR:
Q

Well, 1 think —

You're going to draw a line among crimes.

MR. ZXNGMAN:

I think there are distinctions, and

this Court has recognised that there — that distinctions can
be drawn as between crimes.

Mr. Justice Jackson, speaking for

this Court in the Brandon ease in 1958, dealing with the
Fourth Amendment, pointed out that while the Court would not
countenance a widespread net and search of all vehicles
leaving a community in the case of some misdemeanor, if there
was a kidnapping and such a dragnet was necessary to save the
life of a child, such a search would be countenanced under the
Fourth Amendment»
Sc distinctions among crimes is not such a novel
idea for chis Court.
.Q

Have yon got another one?

MR. ZINGMAN;
Q

Not at the moment, sir.

I didn't think so.

26
Q

Do you think the Court has ever adopted Mr.

Justice Jackson’s view of that bifurcation of the amendment?
MR. 2IN6MMIS

I’va known of no specific application,

but 'I suggest that it is not an unreasonable argument at all.

Q

Under you:: test, Mr. Zingm&n, supposing that the

reporter had witnessed a murder# but there was no reason to
believe that thr roan was in the business of murdering people,
t it was a one-time offense.

Could the grand jury subpoena

him to testify?
MR. SIHGMJiN: Subpoena the reporter?

Q

Yes.

MR.

In — under our balancing test that

would be possible, yes.
Q

But I thought it was danger to national

security, liberty — you would regard the prosecution of an
already completed offense as a way of, in effect, averting that
sort of danger?
MR. ZirnUKSi:

I would say that would come in under

the balancing act, aid it might be permissible for a court,
using the standards we have applied, if he felt that the
definition of prospective damage to human life was there.
Q

tall, fir. Zingraan, I didn't understand you to

stake the argument that your balancing test comes into play
unless or until we’re dealing with confidential information.
MR. ZJNGtXAN: That is correct.

2?
Q

True?

MR. ZXNGM^Ns That is correct.
Q

And my brother Rehnquist's question, as 1 under-*

stood it,' if a reporter is an eyewitness to a murder he's like
anybody else that's an eyewitness to a murder.
But we * re only talking here about something that's
acquired by a journalist in a confidential capacity, are we
not?
MR. ZINGM&N?

I thank you, Mr. Justice Stewart.

1

misunderstood Mr. Justice Relinquish *s question.
Q

"tell, maybe I did also.

Q

Yes.

Maybe X did. also.

It was implicit in my question, certainly.

MR. ZXNGMANs

I deal solely with confidentiality.

Yes, sir.
Q

You would — I take it you would assert the

privilege both with respect to the name of the source, and also
with respect to -**
MR. SINGMAN:
Q

information.

MR. KINGMAN!
Q

Information.

Yes, sir.

Now, let's assume a reporter gets items A to Z,

and he is, he promises not to disclose L to Z, but he may
disclose h to L, and he does.

Concededly, however, L to Z are

very newsworthy items, if ha were free to publish them.
■■■y-st — -and he says, 1 must have this privilege in order that

28
2 can publish A to ?:<? that 1 must be privileged to withhold
this other very newsworthy information.

So your argument is

you must» you must permit him to suppress certain newsworthy
items in order to disclose some other? is that it?
MR. ZXHGMAMfs

Our argument is that the judgment must

be left to the newsman as to what he will publish or not
publish,
0

And he may suppress newsworthy information in

order to publish some of it?
MR, zINGMARs

He might withhold, as a matter of news

judgment, some information that he has acquired, as a basis for
publishing of it? yes, sir, in response to you*; question.
0

And also he * s got the judgment as to when to

publish?
MR. SINGMANs
Q

Yes, sir.

I mean, even if he says, Well, I’m going to -—

these items L to Z I'm going to publish some time but not now,
MR. ZXNGMAM:

He could exercise that judgment.

Let me, if I may, indicate something to the Court.
In the main, the questions that have been posed to me have
dealt with problems of definition of problems of singling
out the newsman, problems of the various kinds of crimes and
such that might or might not be disclosed to the public.
If 1 may, let ne suggest a paradox that we're dealing
with here.

29

In our cases, for example, the petitioner’s cases,
if this Court was to affirm the holdings below, the net affect
would ba to require the petitioner to go into the grand juries
in Kentucky and disclose the identity of two individuals in
one case, and three, four, five, six individuals in another
case, who then might be successfully prosecuted for the
. ,

V

misdemeanors involved.
But the end product would be that that's the end of
it.

From that point on, this Court, having announced that there

is no protection, no further information will be forthcoming
to reporters on a confidential basis; no reporters will be
available to aid the prosecution by giving testimony before
grand juries or any place else, because they’re not going to
have the information.

Elements in the community that might have

provided information, including government officials at all
levels, will no longer provide such information to reporters.
q

Mr. Zingman, in the Pound case, the Kentucky

Court of Appeals suggested that what your client witnessed was
a felony rather than a. misdemeanor.
MR. ZINGMANs

Do you disagree with that?

I don’t disagree with that; it may have

elements of felony in it.
The sources of information will be withheld.
Reporters who have information on a confidential basis would
esirciae prior restraint in the form of self-censorship, by
not. printing foot in £ orn* o t ion for fear that they will be called

30

before grand juries,

And the end result is that the Court8s

ruling here, upholding the decision below, will complete the
circle and completely dry up information, and accomplish
nothing other than the prosecution of the few individuals
involved in these cases.
On the other hand, —
Q

Aren't you saying at that point — perhaps I

don't follow you — that this is precisely the situation that
has prevailed until recently,when your newsmen were able to
get into some of these circles and uncover news that heretofore
was unavailable?
MR. Z2NGMAN: Well, I’m saying that up to now they
have been able to get that information, but once this Court
declares that there is no First Amendment right to protect that,
they're not going to get the information.
Q

That's what I’d say.

Well, a little while ago I thought you said that

up to now they hadn't been able to get this information?
MR. ZINGMAN:
Q

Oh, no, sir.

And that why -—

MR. ZINGMAN;

This case demonstrates that they had

beon able to,
Q

That it's only recently that newsmen have been

able to get into these inner circles.
MR. ZINGMAN:
Q

No, sir.

So, I suggest, that your parade of horribles

31
merely takes us back to where we3d been twenty yeara ago,
MR. ZINGM&sj:

1 don*fc believe it takes as back,

because,, as a practical- matter, the very fact that this issue
has ;oot gotten hare before, I think is demonstration of the
fast that prosecutors have not pressed newsmen up until recent
years, that accommodations have been worked out to protect
confidential sources and such; but in recent years, what I said
was, there has been a distressingly increasing spate of
activity by prosecutors and such to compel information from
newsmen, and the Attorney General's recent guidelines are
indicative of the changed situation, and the recognition of the
fact that there has been this developing situation.
1 am about at the end of my time, so I would just
say, in closing, that what we are talking about is a First
Amendment situation.

We think that the failure to insure to

newsmen a First Amendment right here would result in selfcensorship, prior restraint, the drying up of sources of
information, would result in a total loss to the general public
of the kinds and scope and extent of information which the
First Amendment was designed to achieve.
2 think the records demonstrate very clearly the

chilling effect upon the newsman's ability to operate, that
those subpoenas and compelling testimony induces.
The inevitable conclusion that we believe is the
:

.is rant the newsman is entitled under the First Amendment

32
to refuse to disclose confidential material and to appear in a
closed proceeding under compulsion, unless there has been a
prior demonstr iti

in an open hearing by the government of a

compelling and overriding need for compulsory disclosure»
And ws have suggested three criteria to be applied in
determining whether or not there is such a compelling and
overriding need, none of which we suggest is to be controlling,
but we strongly urge upon the Court that in the historic line
of cases which have preserved and enhanced First Amendment
rights in the process of bringing about that robust and wideopen debate which this Court has noted, in preserving an
untrammeled press, that the cost of — that the necessity for
declaring these First Amendment rights is immediate and urgent
and that it comes at very slight cost to the prosecutorial
&:-paratus,tc the criminal administration apparatus, whereas
the reverse, as was noted yesterday by Mr, Amsterdam in his
argumentf every newsman interviewed in the particular survey
he.;» said that it would be a disaster for the newsman to operate
in the face of a declaration by this Court that confidential
sources could not be protected.
Thank you.
Q

Mr» Singman, before you conclude, is the open

hearing which you mentioned essential to your submission, or
would in camera proceedings be acceptable?
MR. SXNGMMs

Mr» Justice Powell, I don*t think in

33
caraera proceedings would be acceptable, because the thing is
that the moment the newnman goes behind the closed door* that
the suspicions of tie kind that were referred to in the Caldwell
case yesterday are generated.
And so we think it necessitates an open hearing.
Q

And before whom should that hearing be?

MR. 2INGMAN:
Q

The trial judge.

Of course. one ofthe traditional values of the

grand jury, we've always thought, and certainly this Court has
repeatedly said, is that it is not and should not be controlled
by judges or by prosecutors or by anybody else.

Sometimes it's

a corrupt judge that the grand jury is investigating? isn't
that correct?
MR. ZXRGKAN:
Q

I agree with that —

The vary freedom of a grand jury of citizens to

act and investigate without any limitations imposed upon it by
officials has been thought to be one of its values.

Isn't that

correct?
KR. SlVfGMAH:

1 agree with that, but the traditional

practice, for example, as the record shows in this case, the
petitioner was called before the trial judge? the two questions
were read to the trial judge; and the petitioner was directed
by the trial judge to answer those questions.
Q
gcdng

''"o

Well, because the trial judge said, I'm not

interfere with the traditional freedom of a grand jury.

34
Correct?
ME, 1'Hf ifMs

Weil/ if he said that by saying that

1 don't agree wit- you that it's a First or Fourteenth
Amendment privilege„
I would ““ this is not the time nor place * Mr.
Justice Stewart ? but 1 would say there is a great deal of myth
prevalent in the —

Q

there may be, but lawyers and judges have been

saying this to each other for a good many centuries.
MR, ZINGMAN:

Yes, sir.

And —

[Laughter.3
of

— in my twenty-some--odd years of experience in the
courts in Kentucky, without in any way casting any aspersions
on my friend Mr. Schroering here, the myth does not fit the
operations of grand juries in Kentucky.

Q

totId I ask you just one more question?

Do

you claim the seme privilege for trials as compared with grand
juries?
ML. 2XNGMAN: We make some distinction with reference
to trials.

But.

in essence, the way we formulated the situa­

tion, the same balancing test would ba in that case.
Q

So you say the same privilege would be available

to the newsman when he's subpoenaed at an actual trial as he
would have when he's subpoenaed by the grand jury?
MR. Z2NGMAN.:

Yes, sir.

35
Q

He needn’t even appear?

MR, 2XNGMAN:

Oh» I think — I said he would not

have to appear in a cloned proceeding; he has to appear in the
open proceeding.
Q

There’s no need —

But only to claim his privilege?

MR. 2IH6MMN t

He would then assert his privilege not

to respond to questions relating to confidential information.
But certainly would have to appear.
It’s the vice of the closed proceeding that we object
to.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Mr. Zingman, we've

helped you consume your time/ so we — and it is used up? but
we•11 allow you a full five minutes for rebuttal.

tive committee, and they ask him if he believes in Jesus
Christr or God, or what his religion isj? do you think that is

under the First Amendment, that is, freedom of religion.

Q

I know, .but Iem just amasad at this little

three-page *—
MR. SCHROERING:

Q

— religious —

_.ju treat it as almost a frivolous question.

m„ SCHROERING;

I did not mean, by writing a short

brief, Mr. Justice Douglas, to give the impression that I was
writing or thinking that this was a frivolous matter.

Indeed,

I might apologise to the Court by saying that, as chief
prosecutor in my community, indeed, I have many, many cases,
and X believe that sometimes brevity in bringing forth your
argument is ns forceful, perhaps, as an exhausted survey of
the car.ao in any particular field or area»
1 would call the attention of the Court to the eases
that have been cited in connection with some of the questions
that the Court has asked.

I did want *—
Q

You don't cite any cases in your brief?

MR, SCIROERING;•

Riley vs. Lee is cited.

That is a

case decided by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky —
0

Olit X see if now, yes.
RING*

r- which holds that the press has

no more righto under the Constitution than a citizen. And this
is one of the questions which I believe has been directed to
an
counsel in this case. I think that it * s/extremely important
part of this presentation.
X would like to continue with the presentation of ray
argument and call the attention of the Court to KRS 421.100.
Sfow, this particular statute states, in pertinent part, that:
"No person shall be compelled to disclose in any
legal proceedings or trial before any court, or before any
/rand or petit jury, or before the presiding officer of any
tribunal, or his agent or agents, or before the General Assembly,
or any committee therefore, or before any city or county
legislative body, or any committee thereof, or elsewhere, the
source of any information procured or obtained by him, and
.uhiishad in a newspaper or by a radio or television broad­
casting station by which he is engage or employed, or with
Tbich he is connected."
As you can sea by this, Kentucky has adopted, by
i?;tutute, a protection for newsmen.

39
Q

But the same State of Kentucky, through its

judiciary, said that statute just doesn't apply,
MR. SCHROERINGi

The case decided in Bransburg vs..

Haver;, Mr. Justice Marshall, held that the protection does
apply except in the instance of where the newsman is an
actual witness to the crime.

And in that case the court felt

that there was a distinction in his position that the grand
jury has the obligation ~~
Q

Well, what do we have before us, that statute

or the judgement in this case?

We have the judgment in this

case interpreting its own statute. And it says that —
MR. SCHROERXK'Gs
Q

That's correct,

— it doesn't apply,

MR, SCHROERING: That's correct.
Q

So how is it in this case?

MR. SCHROERINGs We raised this question in our
brief as to just how this case arrived at the Supreme Court,
which was a matter o£ some concern to us in our brief, because
the judge held in the court below that the petitioner had
exhausted — excuse me --- that the petitioner had abandoned his
argument on the First Amendment.
But we are here now —
Q

But in the last — I thought the last decision

in your court ruled specifically on the First and Fourteenth
Amendment.

Just said it didn't apply.

40

MR. SCHROERING;

That's correct.

And that's the one that's here.

Q

MR. SCHROERING;

No, there are two cases here, Mr.

Justice Marshall.
Q

Well, that one is hare.

MR. SCHROERING;;
involved*

The case of — there are two cases

The first case was precipitated in 1969; the second,

case was a year later, in a community some 50 miles away from
the first, where the first case arose.
you're absolutely correct.

And in the second case

The question was taken up, and

that's the case involving Brans? burg vs. Meigs.

That question

was before the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals
specifically rejected the Caldwell decision, the decision of
the Ninth Circuit.
Q

Mr. Schroering, even in the Pound case,

certainly the petitioner here, in their application to the
Kentucky Court of Appeals raised the constitutional question,
did they not?

As I read the Appendis: at page 3.0.

MR. SCHROERINGs

Yes, they mentioned that before

Judge Pound, as I recall.

But then, later on, in argument

before the court, and if you will note in the Court of Appeals
decision involving Meigs, it's specifically referred to and
they refer to the portion of the Appendix where they claim,
where the court claims that they abandoned this particular

argument

41
Q

So it!s a contention of abandonment on oral

argument, although the claim was made in the written applica­
tion?
MR. SCHROERXKGs

That’s correct.

The one part of the argument made here, which 1 would
like to refer to at the present time, has to do with an apparent
view on the part of the petitioner that somehow the grand jury
is an alter-ego of the police.

Somehow, that the grand jury

is not acting on its own, but is in the business of acquiring
information? acquiring information for the benefit of
prosecution.
This is not the case, certainly in Kentucky.
Contrary to an inference that has been made by counsel, the
grand juries in Kentucky are not operated any differently from
grand juries throughout the country.

We have 12 a year, and

there are 12 people chosen, through our system of jury
selection.

These people are interested in the enforcement of

the laws of the State of Kentucky.

They are also interested

in the protection of the innocent as well.
And if the grand jury believes that there is
insufficient evidence to show probable cause that an offense
has been committed, or that this person committed it, certainly
— certainly that indictment is going to be dismissed.

And

this is a far cry from saying that one of the greatest dangers
•:e have is that the press will be an arm of the grand jury.

42
q

You mean of the —

MS. SCHROERING;

Excuse me?' of the prosecution.

I'm

very sorry.
q

The grand jury often investigates the police?

does it not?
MR. SCHROERINGi
q

Often it does? and that —

Particularly in certain counties in Kentucky?

in my experience.
[Laughter.]
MR. SCHROERING: That’s correct.
Mid I’ve had the pleasure of investigating the police

department myself? in my capacity as servant to the grand jury.
So that's very true.
q

Is there a grand jury empaneled e/ery. you say

every month in each county in Kentucky?

Or did 1 misunder­

stand you?
MR. SCHROERINGs

No.

No. During the terms in the

smaller judicial districts; but every month in courts of
continuous session, as we have.
Q

Hew many counties in Kentucky?

MR. SCHROERING:
q

120.

Does the prosecutor or the police in Kentucky

use newspapermen as agents or runners or investigators?
MR. SCHROERING;

No? Mr. Justice Douglas? we do not

use ? the prosecution does not use the news media for this

43
purpose,

Indeed, xe had an unusual situation where the grand

jury had soma of its sessions in the building of & local
newspaper during a recent incident.

But this does not have

any application here.
And I'm not saying this by any way inferring that
the petitioners would use the grand jury in any such a manner
that they were not supposed to.
But the — as I see it, the newsman has no more
privilege under the law than the average citizen.

There is,

of course, a chilling effect upon, any use of the law, if the
grand, jury goes out and subpoenas someone and asks them a
question, and citizens observe that person going before the
grand jury, certainly there’s seme effect that might develop
from this.

'
But isn't this something that we have to accept as a

part of our obligation as citizens?
I would call the attention to the Court of the
procedure which has been suggested by counsel in his discussion
of how you would have this open hearing to determine whether
:■ newsman would be subpoenaed, in which they refer to the same
type of procedure that we would use in determining Fifth
Amendment privileges.
The Fifth Amendment applies to everyone.

The Fifth

Amendment does not merely apply to a newman or any group of

newsmen

44
Also would like to call the attention to the Court of
the reasons why •'-.he informants gave their information to the
newsman, and it*3 in the brief's

he wanted to bug the narcotics

agents involved in the community.
This appears to be a reason not quite as important
as some of the reasons that have developed in other privileges
under the law that we've noticed.

Certainly bugging the

narcotics agents, his purpose in giving the information, is not
the type of a privilege, or should not go to consider the type
of privilege that's being requested here.
The petitioner has suggested these different tests
to be made.
I would take the position that this would fetter the
grand jury process, to the point that it would have a sub­
stantial affect upon the operation of the grand jury.
The grand jury certainly has deep roots in constitu­
tional law.

They have a constitutional duty to investigate,

just as the press has the freedom, as any other citisen.

When

these two meet under these circumstances, certainly doesn't
the grand jury, that acts for all of the people, doesn't their
constitutional duty carry heavier weight in this connection
than the corresponding privilege which is advanced here by
counsel?
Q

Well, of course if it applies — if there is

no privilege in this case, there * d be no privilege in any trial.

45
I'd suppose.

The petit jury has a great dignity under our

system, too.
MR. S2KROERIF3 s

Only the Fifth Amendment would

apply? that is our position, for constitutional reasons.
Heir, there are privileges that are set out by statute
and Wigxaore discusses the privileges and the different types.
And his feeling is that privileges should not be — should not
be advanced.

He thinks that the more privileges you have the

more difficult it is to administer the law.
And certainly I think that in this instance, the
Kentucky statute -0

Of course it depends upon what you think the

purpose of the law may be»
country?

Have you ever bean, to a totalitarian

Have you been to Russia?
\

MR. SCHROERINGs

f

1 have not, Mr. Justice Douglas,

been to Russia.
Q

And seen the press, the kind of a press that

you have under a regimented society?
MR. SCHROERXNGs

1 would never want to have- such a

situation occur in this country.

And X agree wholeheartedly

with the statute which has been passed by the Legislature of
Kentucky granting to the press a privilege, a ••legislative Act,
they have a privilege.

But 2 also agree with the Court of

Appeals, that when the reporter starts to transcend from a
rocsiver of information to a witness to a serious crime, which,

46
I might say, was a felony at the time that the investigation
began in 19S9, hut today, by change of statute, is now a
.'»ds demeanor.
Q

Then you9 ve made every reporter a runner for the

government, in every case.,
MR, SCHRQER2NG s

If we assume that that is a function

of the grand jury, to be an arm of the government, —
Q

But this doesn't stop at grand juries.

These

rules, with their exceptions, have a tendency to run the full
limit of their logical extent.
MR,. SCHROERING;
Q

No, I ~

They apply to the petit jury; apply to

administrative agencies; and would apply, I would think, to
every aspect that passes to the government.
MR. SGHROERXNG;

You mean that each of‘these agencies

would thereby employ the press to do their job for them?
Q

No, I mean they would — if he can be required

to testify in this, 1 don't see why he couldn't be required to
testify at the SEC or Federal Trade or —
Q

It wouldn't be employing them, because you don't

pay them.
MR. SCHROERING:
Q

Ho.

But you might end up.

MR. SCHROERING; Well, 2 don't think that 1 would use
the earns analogy with aims of government who are out attempting

47
to obtain information.
from that.

The grand jury has its roots different

It has additional obligations under the law? and

set out in the • Constitution, which makes it independent, And
this is the reason why I suggested this.

I feel that throughout

argument on this, that the grand jury has been placed in a
position before thin; Court, in the view of the petitioner, that
it’s somehow an arm of the Commonwealth.

And X will not agree

with this.

1 think that the corresponding:,..vc.' constitutional
obligations of the grand jury, as far as the defendants are
concerned, are just as important as for the prosecution.

So

how can we say that the grand jury is an arm, an alter-ego of
the Commonwealth?
Q

Well, if this judgment is-affirmed, then every

place in the country, once a story appears in the press which
shows confidential information concerning a crime, wouldn’t it
automatically follow that the grand jury would subpoena that
reporter?
MR. SCHROERINGs. Not necessarily.
Q

Well, how — but you say they’re so great, how

could they be doing their job if they didn’t?
MR. SCHROERING:

If the newspaper reporters observe

a crime, the commission of a crime, they become a witness and
they have a duty and a responsibility to testify in a court of
law.

48
Q

Well, then wouldn't it be true that once they

publish a story they volunteer as a witness?
MR. SCHRQERING s

They are subject to being sub­

poenaed before the grand jury —
Q

And wouldn’t they be subpoenaed?

MR» SCHROERING: That's correct.

Just like you would

subpoena a husband in Kentucky, or a wife, in connection with a
case, or you would subpoena someone else with some privilege»
They would raise the privilege in the particular communication
involved in the court of law, whether it be before the grand
jury or whether it be before the petit jury.
They have a right —
Q

Well, X think, if X understand this case

correctly, he did raise the privilege, and it was denied.
MR. SCHROERING;
Q

It was denied ~

So then 1 say further that if we affirm this

case, every time a reporter publishes a story of this type he
will be: subpoenaed before the grand jury, will make his claim
of privilege, and it will be denied.
MR, SCHROERINGs

Am I right?

Only if there is an indication that

he is also a witness to the crimeT in Kentucky,
Q

Well, I’m saying a case of this type.

Q

1 didn’t think we were talking about a witness

to a crime. This is a case, as I understand it, where, in
confidence„ this mat is given information.

49

MR. SCHROERXMG:

He was told --

H:. "s not walking down the street and sees a bank
being held up.

That’s not this case, is it?

MR. SCHROBRXNGs
Q

No? but this case is one where —

We’re talking about confidential information.

MR. SCHROERXNG; Confidential information, and also
the.reporter witnessed the compounding of hashish, the combining
together of the elements of that drug, which is a felony in
Kentucky.
And under the circumstances there is an overriding,
certainly an overriding need that these individuals be brought
to justice under our law.
Q

1 know, but being a member of the Communist

Party has been a crime in the United States.

Attending a

meeting and witnessing, counting the heads in the room is
witnessing who the members are.
I mean, this leaves a — this goes a long distance.
MR. SCHROERING* The present law, as of the common law,
does not grant a privilege, First Amendment privilege, to
newsmen, any more than any other occupation, any specialised
occupation.
So 1 cannot bee how, that the situation can be worse
than it is right now if the privilege is not extended to news­
man o
! think one of the most important arguments to make

50
to the Court is in connection with the constitutional rights
of individuals as opposed to groups, sole groups, individual
groups that aiay have certain interests.

And in this connection

the media has interests which they want to protect, and
certainly the media 'is extremely important in our society
today.
Q

Mr. Schroering, --

MR. SCHROERXNGs
Q

But no law is supreme

excuse me.

— in that connection Mr. Zingman made a very

appealing argument about the drying up of sources of informa­
tion .

What is your response to that?
MR. SCHROERING:

X do not believe that the sources

of information will be dried out.

As a matter of fact, in this

instance, within a few months after the action taken by

Judge

Pound, the same newspaper reporter went 50 miles away from our
community and published an entirely new article on the same
subject matter.

And apparently had no difficulty in getting

individuals in that community, within the range of that
newspaper, to give him all sorts of information.
Now, I might say this, that if the reporter had
appeared before the grand jury in May, instead of refusing to •
appear, in my opinion the court would have sustained his
privilege under 421.100.

I am not saying here that he does

not have a privilege; but what 1 am saying is that when he
turns from a reporter to a witness, when he becomes a witness

51
to a crime, at that point, at that point there8s an overriding
need that he perform his duty as a citizen %

appear before the

grand jury, which has the constitutional responsibility of

Q

Hr. Schroering, the protective order entered by

Judge Meigs, as I read it, recognises a qualified privilege of
newsmen.

It's not clear to me from what you've said whether

your position here 'this morning is that you agree with Judge
Meigs that a qualified privilege exists, or is it your
position that no privilege whatever exists?
ME. SCJROERINGs Well, in Kentucky, !t8s the
statutory privilege that exists.

1 would argue that there is

no First Amendment privilege on the part of a newspaper
reporter to refuse to answer questions in connection with
!-

••

offenses that he has witnessed.
Q

Well, the first three paragraphs of Judge Meigs®

order do not necessarily relate to crimes actually witnessed,
they reflect a recognition of a qualified privilege with
respect to information.
MR. SCHROERlNGs
D

That's correct.

But do you agree with his order in that respect?

MR. SCHROERING s

I believe that he probably modeled

that order after Caldwell.
q

He no doubt did, but I want to know if you agree

52
with it or not?
MR, SCHROEEINGs

X do not agree with the Caldwell

decision,
Q

Well, was his order not reflecting in part the

statute of the Commonwealth of Kentucky?
MR. SCHROERIHG:

Yes, but when he granted the

privilege that he could consult with counsel in connection with
it, this of course is not in our statute.

There were other

portions of it which led me to believe that what he did was,
that he modeled the protective order from the same protective
order’ that we find in Caldwell.

And X think that when the case

went to the Court of Appeals, they made their decision on
whether or not Caldwell would be the proper law in the Stats of
Kentucky.
Q

The State didn’t appeal from that portion of

Judge Meigs' order that were adverse to it?
MR. SCHROERIHGs That's correct.

The counsel that

j

argued the Meigs case in the Court of Appeals did not, I don't
believe, file a brief with this particular Court.
X argued the case for Judge Hayes, and did file a
brief, short though it may have been.
Actually, the argument that the press makes, that
they can’t get information any more, and indicate that the
problem in recent year's, there*s bean an activity, an increased
activity on the part of prosecutors in this connection? X do

not believe it as supported by the facta.

Certainly there has

been an of fort made by grand juries in recent years to do their
job .

But I do not conclude thereby that it is strictly
because of the action of government or the action of grand

jurieso

We!ve had a considerable amount of publicity, much,

much more in connection with the operation or the commission
of ericas in recent years.

And this, of course, is not

necessarily a bad thing.
t

derb't want the Court to get the impression that 2

am arguing that.

But I am saying that the responsibility,

the constitutional responsibility of this grand jury to
investigate-, n:only for the benefit of the people but
certainly for the benefit of a defendant who may or may not
be charged, depending upon whether probable cause had been

properly shown to that grand jury, is of overriding importance.
And, undeed, if.we had a system whereby we had to
apply in open court, in order to get a subpoena, if we had to
go to the judge in open court to apply, there would be no
question the- grand jury would be fettered.

Because the pledge

of secrecy which we' have in the grand jury is also a protection.
And in an open hearing, what does this do to the pledge of

secrecy?
Is the suggestion made that this should be done.
oernaos because tun media would want, more publicity concerning

54
that reporter's testifying before the grand jury?

I don’t know.
Q

.or» Schroering, is it the procedure in Kentucky

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS3 ESQ. ,
FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR, REYNOLDS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The U: ited States is appearing as amicus in these
«a'-so, anu tk® ease that follows, In the Matter of Paul Pappas

. I therofews vi.ll adorers ray remarks hare to the three cases

which involvo the broad argument with respect to the First

privilege for news reporters to withhold from grand jury

And they

might well overlap.
Q

How would this case be decided under the guide­

line of the Attorney General?

HP;,, REYNOLDS?

The Attorney General guidelines do

not grant any immunity to a news reporter with respect to grand
jury proceedings.
But they do set up a procedure whereby, before &
reporter will be called before a grand jury, there will foe
some negotiation with

the news media, prior to that time,

and to ascertain and determine the need for the testimony of
the reporter, and whether or not there are other sources from

Those guidelines are in year brief in the

Hot to my knowledge at the present

I’m not aware of any case thus far.
Q

So that if the guidelines did apply, if this was

a. federal situation, it would ba a matter of negotiation

between the Attorney General and the press?
MR. Rl;ISOLDS: Essentially that's correct. Your Honor.

Q

But the fast that there are guidelines ,

established by the attorney General, I suppose suggests that
we*re dealing in a pretty sensitive area.

Otherwise, why

guidelines?
Mu EBYMMHUj Well, J; believe that w© are dealing in

■a sensitive area.

I don't believe anybody disputes that,

ihe question here is whether we are to create a new
constitutional privilege in the First Amendment for a specific
class of citlaensj that is, news reporters.

And 1 don't

believe that the fact that the Attorney General has issued
guidelines in what is an admittedly sensitive area, that it
follows from that fact that we need to create a constitutional
privilege of this nature.
0

He said the guidelines are based on a reesgni-

lion, <.:«ote, ;'3of limiting effects on the exercise of Fis st
Amendment rights", close quote.
MW REYNOLDS:

Your Honor, X think we all recognize

that when we3re talking about newsgathering, that in the
penurafora cf First Amendment interests there is lurking some
Where an intereat in nexasgsthering»
1 don't think that there is much doubt, if the
government ware to cut off all access to a particularly
impoverished aroa, for example, solely* for the reason that
they do not want the public to know what was going on there,
that that would be permissible under the First Amendment»
But n^wsgathering is an exceedingly broad concept»
And as this Court recognised in Sernmill v, Russ, in many
respects it connotes action more than expression.
I think plainly that one does not have any
constitutional right to access to particular newsworthy
stories or newsworthy items.

I, for instance, don’t think that,

es a matter of ;onsuitutional law, a news reporter could gain

access to a White House conference, or a conference in the
Supreme Court,

for example,

because it might be a newsworthy

story.
Moreover, and this has been pointed out in prior
questions end answers before the Court, newsgathering as a
First .'tnencmanfc interest is not an interest that is only
with the institutionalized press, of the news reporter.
I think that any citizen, any individual who is
concerned with exchanging ideas or disseminating information

to others, whether he be ? news reporter, an author, a free-

58
Xan.ce waiter,- a xvofosso:;:, he has the same interest in the
t Amendment .and newsgathering.

Hor, in my idswf is it, ■

confined to the written word or publication or, as I think Mr.

Justice v.ehnq-aisi pointed out, the lecturer or the public
debater, or any individual citizen who wished to exchange
ideas or in forme, aion with friends or associates would have the
same interest in gathering news.
X don * t think it’s an exclusive interest that we find
in the free press language of the First Amendment? I think it's
also inherent in free speech.
And it's our view that, as a matter of constitutional
theory, if weere going to construct a privilege based on a
First Amendment interest in newsgathering, that that privilege
ie going to have to pertain not just to news reporters but to
anybody who says that an appearance before a grand jury is
going to have a chilling effect on his confidential, sources of
information,
There is an additional difficulty that, in those
aireuma iisnee3 them5 b an additional difficulty on how to
determine or verify confidentiality.

That's one of these

factor* ■ that the court, oy its nature, is going to be unable
to scrutinize,
Cur position, is essentially that to allow this type
of wholesale interference, and it would be wholesale interfer­
ence with the grand jury, is contrary and undercuts the

59

specific protec-that the framers of the Constitution
intent. w by the Fifth Amendment.
The Fifth Amendment provides that a grand jury shall
the sole method for preferring charges in criminal cases ,
sextons crimina.', cases,,

Our grand jury is modeled after the

English grand jury .ns a body of laymen with very broad powers
to investigatef in secret, alleged criminal acts not only for
determining probable guilt but also for the purpose of
protecting innocent people from false prosecutions.
From the early days of the republic and, indeed, in
England, attendance upon and testimony before a grand jury has
been a public duty which every citizen is bound to perform
when summoned.
?ve don’t think that the framers of the Constitution
wore unaware of this obligation.

Nor do we think they were

unaware of the fact, as has been pointed out already in prior
discussion this morning, that anybody who is called before a
grand jury is going to have soma adverse effect on First
Amendment interests, either speech or associations! ties or
press.

But the area of.this potential conflict is an

exceedingly narrow one.

It's an area that deals only with

questions of criminal activity.
And in that narrow area, we think that the framers

or.

so Constitution, in reconciling the broad public interest,

in having w grand jury with these broad investigatorial powers,

60
and the First hr .sndmanfc interest that might be indirectly

affected by calling these people to appear before a grand jury,
.

rxnined that there should be no altera­

:

tion of the requirement,, the general requirement that people
appear and give testimony before grand juries»
Now„ they did write an exception into the Fifth
Amendment? the exception against self-incrimination.
But there is no exception written into the First
Amendment,

We think that the very direct effect that is

possible on First Amendment interests,, that is interests in
speech and association, which are, in our view, far more
direct First Amendment interests than what we9 re talking about
here, which is a more remote interest in newsgathering.
But the effect on those direct interests by appearing
before a grand jury were, we think, not unforeseen by the framers
and they did not see fit to write a privilege into the First
Amendment.

We don't believe that this more remote interest,

in terms of newjgatharing, is one that would require that we
now create a. new privilege in the First Amendment.
Now, we've heard a lot this morning about the fact
that the holding by this Court to the effect that there is no
privilege in the- First Amendment is going to dry up news
sources,

I think that that —

I think that that is — but I don’t ~~

Aren't the Attorney General's guidelines a

manifestation of that very thing?
MR. REYNOLDSs That is correct.
Q

And 1 suppose, too, those guidelines have a

further effect, with 93 branch offices, as it were, 93 United
States Attorneys around ihe country, that such an important and
sensitive area as this ought to have a uniform treatment in
the Federal system.

I suppose that's the function of those

guidelines, is it not?
MR. REYNOLDS? That’s the function of those guidelines, that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

.hnd if no cor/.titutional privilege is recognized,

62
there are the guidelines, and of course we'11 continee, as Mr.
i'UBtica Marshall suggested, to have the sarse kind of

negotiations.
Q

Do for. think that the First Amendment, as applied

to the States, is to he read tbs same as whan it’s applied to
the Federal Government?

MR, REYNOLDS s

I do, Your Honor»

I don’t think there

is a distinction along those lines.
i.l-3 far as the drying up of the sources, this claim,

we might point out, is being made by a certain segment of the
media? by, in these eases, essentially the large metropolitan
newspapers, by amicus briefs, the large major TV networks.
And Professor Blaise’s report, that had been referred to
yesterday, talks also in terms of, as this study group is
compiled, newspapers with a circulation of over 50,000.
bow, while conceivably it might be; demonstrated that
a reporter1s privilege is desirable for that segment of the
media, it may veil not be desirable on balance to provide such
protection for newspapers with a smaller circulation.

There

may be no problem with drying up of news sources or drying up
of news stories when we * re dealing with the smaller segment
of the ~ the smaller circulation.

we think that it * s for the Legislature to determine on an
informed judgment, looking at the different particular problems
with respect, to different medi a, and to meet that difficulty
in that way.
We don’t believe that there is •— that the right
approach is a constitutional privilege that is to be confined
to a particular class of citisenry, that is, news reporters as
such.

there is also a difficulty as to what is a reporter,
h'\s been pointed out, and who would be covered along those
lines.
ho our knowledge, this Court has never recognised

in the First amendment or in any other amendment in the Bill
of Right?.--, any special rights or privileges that apply to a
special class of citizens.

And we do not think that it would

be appropriate to do so here.

MR. KIAGAAII:

Mr. Chief Justice — thank you.

I would briefly point out that,Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
you asked a question about the abandonment of the First and
Fourteenth Amendment claims in the Kentucky Court of Appeals.,»
and Mr. Schrcsring, 1 believe in error, stated that the
contention was that in oral argument I had abandoned that
claim.

That's not what the record discloses.
The record discloses that the Court of Appeals claimed

wov? t the Col led, tor General has referred, in his
argument, to the Attorney General * s guidelines in response to a
question from Mr. Justice Douglas•
I would point out that, first of all, as Mr. Justice
bong .las recognised, and as 2 think the Court must recognise
because the Solicitor General states it in his brief, this
is a very delicate area recognised by the Federal Government t
but then the Solicitor General, in his brief, says that the
Attorney General’s guidelines do not create any litigable
rights.
So what we have is, in the Federal area, a statement
of policy, but, at the same time, the Solicitor General tells
mb

that if they decide not tc follow it that's their judgment

and no rights are conferred.
We’re talking about First Amendment rights end, as
Mr. Reynolds indicated, we are talking about the penumbra of
rights, and we suggest that under the penumbra this right is
necessary of declaration.
