MR. CH :ep JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 70-230, Carleson against Remillard.
Mr. Liiderman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
OR \L ARGUMENT OP JAY S. LINPERMAN, ESP.,
ON BEHALF OF THF APPELLANTS
MR. LXNDERMAN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
<

This c ise presents the questions of whether the
Social Security let requires California to qrant welfare
benefits to chiI Iren whose fathers are out of the home on active
duty in the tnili :ary service.

Specifically, the question is

whether, under Title 4 of the Social Security Act, the Aid to
Families with De:ondent Children Program, a military orphan who
is otherwise nee ly — in other words, the income standards of
the family are s ifficiently low that they qualify under the
State standard,

edd standard — whether that child is a

"dependent child1 under Section 406(a) of the Federal Act,
Q

13 the entire group excluded, or just case-by™

case, child-by-clild?
MR. LI JDERMAN: The entire group of military orphans,
Your Honor?

Q
MR.

Y js.

LX

group is exclude

PJERMAN:

Servicemen's children?

The entire

a :■ are the children of a father who is

4
employed away from home in a civilian capacity.

In other

words , the exclusion under the California statute or regulation
is that if there is a breadwinner in the family, but out of the
home, the child, be it a military or civilian employment
situation, the child is ineligible as to —
Q

And that's true regardless of whether or not the

father was drafted or volunteered?
MR. LIliDERMAN:
Q

That is correct.

And regardless of the nature of his service,

and regardless as to his rank or grade?
MR. LIliDERMAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

0

Now, let me

Q

And regardless —

Q

Go ahead.

0

—

regardless of whether he's sending any part

of his income hone, and regardless of whether he is a prisoner
of war?
MR. LIliDERMAN: The assumption, Your Honor, is that
the child is needy; where he may be sendinq some money home,
but it’s inadequate in terms of the need standards under
California lav?,
Q

Well, would it be difficult -— would it be

impossible or very difficult for California to determine how
much of an allot! ant of a drafted man, we'll confine it to that,
a drafted man in the service, how much he is sending home on

5

the allotment, 'and then at least give the benefits to the
extent of the difference?

Would that be, administratively, a

difficult thing • o do?
MR. LUMBERMAN:

Is Ybmr Honor questioning the

administrative burden?
0

Yes.

MR. LIT BERMAN:
it.

I am not certain that I can answer

I assume that it would be relatively difficult, in that,

presumably there would be a fluctuating amount of income —
Q

Not iff he's a lower class — that is, in the

first few grades

there's a fixed allotment sent home.

MR.I/INDERMAN: There is, but then the question is
that the State would have to ascertain, on a month-by-month
basis, that in fact that amount did get there. So that I
believe the answer to Your Honor's question in terms of the
administrative effort is that it would have to be an on-going
month-to-month determination or verification of fh<? precise
amount that did actually end up in the hands of the family.
Q

-Weil, Mr. Linderman, I gather that under the

California practice, where the absence is due to imprisonment
or medical treatment or parental separation, that inquiry is
made on an individual basis.
MR. LINDERMAN:
Q

That's correct, Your Honor.

Well, then, what's the distinction between those

classifications and this across-the-board as applied to

6
children of fathers absent under military orders?
MR, LIL'DERMAN; The distinction, I believe, Your
Honor, is that California concedes, in the instances that yoi:.
have mentioned,

hat the Federal law requires the granting of

assistance»
We vie* or acknowledge that the situation of an
imprisoned father: or a deported father or dissolution of the
marriage, and so on, that that type of child is clearly within
the scope and purpose of the Social Security Act.
Q

And yet the guideline — all of these are

based on the same: guideline, aren't they?

That’s 3422„2?

MR. UhDEFMAN: That’s the HEW —
Q

That’s what. I mean.

MR. LII; HERMAN;
Q

Ye 3 .

And that one, within this interpretation of

continued absence,"the State agency in developing its policy
will find it necessary to give consideration to such situations
as divorce, pending divorce, desertion", all the way down
the line, "service in the armed forces or other military
service", and males no distinctions of the kind that California
draws, does it?
MR. LII HERMANi

No.

HEW merely requires, as the

regulation says, that the State will find it necessary to give
consideration to these groups in the process of the Ptate
defining its own eligibility policy.

This has been the

traditional approach.
0

We-11, of course, but — "find it necessary to

give considerablen” — may it distinguish in the way it gives
consideration uncar that regulation?
MR. LI! DEFMAN:

Distinguish in the sense, yes, that

you can find one group eligible and another group ineligible.
Q

Yes, but that’s not what the problem is.

problem is that you treat each case on anindividual

The

basis

in all categories except service in the armed forces.
MR, LUMBERMANs
Q

No, that’s not correct, Your Honor.

It's not?

MR. LIIJDSRMAN:

In the categories of, say, desertion,

or imprisonment —
Q

Yes.

MR. LI;.DERMAN:
eligible.

— as a group the children are

Provided that they then meet the need standard as

well.
In other words, as a group, California determines the
child of an imprisoned father to be eligible provided that
there is a sufficiently low amount of income, which undoubtedly
there's going to be with the father in prison.
But, as California makes group determinations of
eligibility, both with respect to "Yes they are eligible" or
"No they are not" —
Q

D:>es that suggest, Mr. Linderman. that the

8

Court of Appeals is wrong?

Of course , I'm reading, in cases

of a father's ab -anee due to imprisonment, temporary medical
treatment, or parental separation, California considers each
applicant's situ tion individually.
MR. LI DERMANs

Yes, Your Honor, we submit that the

District Court Q

T at's wrong?

MR, LINDESMANt
Q

I see«

MR. LI DERMAN:
our brief.

— is wrong,

And have specifically so said in

We di challenge that? that that is a misstatement

of what Californ a does do,
I thinl the question hare, though, is not whether
California administratively could do this or whether, in terms
of social policy they should do it? the question is, has
Congress compelled California to do it now.
And or,:, position is that it has not.
Congre s has defined the group of eligible children
to b® those that lack the support of a parent due to death,
incapacity, or continued absence.
This case specifically is the question:

what does

Congress mean by continued absence?
At the time that the case was argued below, all we
had was the HEW ; egulafcion that Mr. Justice Brennan has just
referred to, the:'

left it to the State to determine what

ft

continued absence meant, within the scops of HEW’s interpreta­
tion, which was

. substantial severance, economic and socially,

within the family.

And cited as their example, HEW cited as

their example, the situation where the father simply deserts
the family and disappears.

The mother knows not where he is

or when he will ha home or if he will be home.
Ii complete destruction of the sociological and

economic ties between the father and the child.

That's the

example that HEW gives.. ■
There Is, we submit, nothing more than that in the
Act itself, and hus, given the 35 years that HEW has had
*
this policy, and the fact that over the years the States have
exercised the op :ion, with Congress doing nothing to disapprove
this, and with tie result that there*s a roughly 50/50 split
between the states in terms of which ones do and which ones
do not grant aid, that we think that the State should be
continued the option of defining their own eligibility policy.
The question of course then arises of what impact
on this past pat :.ern does the Court's recent decision in the
Townsend case have on this case?
Townsend of course is the Illinois AFDC case, in
which the State

if Illinois had defined an eligible student

to be one who w&enrolled only in a vocational school,
excluding those

:hgt ware enrolled in academic institutions,

colleges, univssr cities, non-vocatlonal.

10

The Court, in Townsend, held, found that Congress had
explicitly defined what it meant by a student, the Federal Act
itself specifically said that a student was any child up to the
age of 21, enrolled in any educational institution.
furthermore, the.

And,

Congress had made clear that it intended

that the States must grant assistance to all types of students.
Therefore, the Court held that Illinois obviously could not
define 3student“ in a fashion that directly conflicted with
the definition provided by Congress.

1 would submit that, on its facts, Townsend

is

completely distinguishable from this case, in that there is
neither the precise Congressional definition of continued
absence nor is there any indication, legislative history-wise
or otherwise, that Congress intended that the States have to
grant assistance in all types of continued absence or that
there had to be v. nationally uniform definition to the term.
Assuming, for-the sake of argument, that we have
misread the Townsend case, and that it does mean, in the
Court’s view, that there must he nationally uniform standards
for all aspects of the AFDC program, and that Congress or
HEW, presumably HEW, must give contents to the vague term
used by Congress
should be held tt

We would submit, then, that the definition
be

of ineligibility for servicemen’s

family, for the following reasons:
In the case of King vs. Smith, this Court traced the

11
legislative hist ry and outlined, delimited the contours
of the APDC prog .am, as the Court perceived it, which was that
Congress was not intending to aid all needy children, but,
rather, that it '■■/as endeavoring to provide financial assistance
to States for fch

purpose of aiding children who lacked a

breadwinner»
I thin

a reading of the King case makes clear that

it’s a lack of a breadwinner and not merely a wage-earner who
can't bring home enough bread.

In other words, that APDC is

not designed to be a subsidy for low-paying employers, be it
the United State
Q

Government or otherwise»

Well, let me ask you on that score, suppose the

ostensible bread/inner, the father, was handicapped and xrorked
at the Good Will, and because of his handicap could make only
$118 a month, we Id that automatically make them ineligible
for Aid to Depen ant Families, Children?
MR. LXMDEPMAN:
Honor — I'm ass

Unless that particular father, Your

ling full employment, in terms of number of

hours.
Q

Yes.

MR. LI1 .DERMAN:

Q

He*s fully employed, but ~™

KVs blind or whatever, some disability so that

— well, let's not make it blind, because then he'd be getting
some income unde// Social Security.

,

But he’s got some handicap

vtaybe just basic intelligence, but he works at full capacity

12
and makes this nominal amount.
MR. LXYDERMAN: Ans is living in the home with the
family?
0

On, yes.

He's trying to win the bread for the

family.
MR. LIIDERMAN:

I do not believe that that family

would be eligible.
Q

Under the Federal statute or the regulations of

California?
MR. LIIDERMAN:

Under the Federal statute.

he is an employe! breadwinner living in the home.
Q

Because

Now,

Unless it could b® shown that he “was physically

or mentally —
MR. LI iDERMAN:

But again, then,. 1

I'm not completely clear on that.

Continued absence from the home or ~~

MR. LI.IDERMANs

Yes, that’s right.

To be utterly honest, I'm not completely clear
whether, in that instance, there would be eligibility or not.
But I think then —
0

Well, assuming for the moment that there would

be eligibility -~
MR. Li: iDERMAN:

Q

13
eligibility.
How, tlaa, a Private First Class, lowest grade,

marriedf with dep indents, is permitted, 1 understand as a matter
of regulation, perhaps statute,- $118 a month allotment for his
family.

Could vca conceivably have an arguable equal protection

argument if the tan at horns earning $118 was treated in a
different way from the drafted soldier earning enough so that
there was $118 a month allotment?
MR. HI! DSRMAN:

1 suppose, conceivably — I'm assuming

now that you’re talking not in terms that California makes a
decision on its own, but that Congress -Q

Ho,

I'm just saying, is there arguably an

equal protection problem.there?
MR.LIKDPRMMfs

-

I suppose that it's conceivable that

there is, Mr. Chiaf Justice,

But 1 think the equal protection

question that the appellees in this cane purport to raise is a
completely different type of situation from the one that Your
Honor is hypothesising.
But again I believe that it's correct to say that in
the example proposed, that the handicapped father, that situation,
the child would n t be eligible.
We woul

submit that, again referring tc the King case,

that Congress recagnisad and the Court recognised in the King

case that the problems posed by and the solution for unemploy...mb and under.aup. oyme:.it are drastically different, and- that

14
AFDC was designed to aid not the underemployed breadwinner.
Q

Weil, really- it's not the underemployed bread­

winner f either, was it?

It was designed to aid children in

families where there -was no ~~ where one of the parents was
not there.

Xsn® that it?
MR. LUMBERMANs

That's correct.

But it subsequently

has been expands?; to include the unemployed , AFDC has now been
expanded to incl- .de the unemployed father in the home.
But net. the underemployed.
Turning then to the equal protection auesticn, which
the appellees raise, which again dovetails, 1 believe, with
our suggestion o;

our contention that if there must be a

uniform standard \is-a-vis servicemen's families, that it
should be ineligibility, that for the same reason it’s not a
denial of equal protection to deny benefits to servicemen's
families when at the same time, granting them to families of.
for example, prisoners.
It's axiomatic, I believe, that the equal protection
clause does not ;

quire States or the Federal Government to

treat classes that are in fact different, legally differently.
And I would submit that the situation, the economic
situation and th

sociological situation, posed by s. serviceman

on one hand, a prisoner or a deportee on the other, are
dramatically dif:iarent.
First

a: all, the imprisoned father can offer no

15
economic security to bis family.

The serviceman —

V!- :I1 , suppose he were a millionaire, a Leopold

Q
or a Loeb?

MR. LIWDERMAN:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, then I think

we*re not talking about the income-generating capacity or the
sociological imp:ict, in terms of the intrafamiliar strains
that imprisonment would cause; but of course if he's a
millionaire, and the money is available to the child, —
Q

But the child —

MR. LT i DERMAM s
eligible.

— the child is not going to be

Ho matter whether the father is a millionaire,PFC

or whether he's
Q

millionaire prisoner,
Off whether he's away from home or not?

MR. 1.1 'IDERMAH:
child is not needy then.

Or whether he's away from horn©.

The

Which is the second facet of

eligibility, which is not present in this case.
We are assuming that the child is needy ir this
case, and the State has conceded that the plaintiffs, the
appellees in the case, the named plaintiffs are needy and, by
definition, tin class represented by the named plaintiffs are
those families that are needy.
So thet aspect of eligibility is not in issue in the
case.

It's strictly a question of dependency or whether the

father is contiguously absent.
Again, then, the economic implications are different.

16
ifc imprisoned father, the deported father can offer no
cv'.c f;.^ouritj to the child,, and sociologically wa believe:
that there is & evbsianti&I differ ©no©.. both in terms of the
disruptive infit-c cce in fence of the family ties of military
jervice and iia

ram&ni:t with a super impos it ion of a social

ostracism that gs ..vs with imprisonment or deportation, which
we think in the i orraal situation, anyway, is totally lacking
in the ease of mi litary service,
Q

Neill, now, does the legislative history of the

Act of Congress rake these distinctions you're talking about,
or are these jusl

advanced as your considerations?

MR. LXhOERMA&s We view the legislative history of the
Act as supporting these contentions, and, furthermore, this
Court's tracing fid delimiting of the Act's scops in King vs.
Smith as erecting these kind of limits around the program.
As I

ev

pci King, the suggestion is there that Congress

was concerned in the AFDC program with a limited class of
children, and ths Court says in King specifically that the
Act is not desig* id to aid all needy children; but the class is
only those that. 'J vk the breadwinner.

And trie Court talks in

King about the !•; ?k of the likelihood of any economic
security inuring to the child in the King case from the
motherJ si paramous f who owed the child no duty of support.
It's fi:m that that I draw the economic aspect,
that there it a '

ok of livelihood of economic protection for

1?

ties

.hrovgn dear.h, divorce, continues absence from the home
But th t that analogizing the continued absence

facet of eligibility to the other facets? death and

that I'm referri..g to.
1 don’

think it’s of my imagination, but 1 think

it’s clearly as Congress has limited the program.
Now, t-ie District Court adverts briefly to the
possibility that my characterization of a less severe dis­
location occurring in the service situation as opposed to the
imprisonment is oerhaps overstated. Well, it may very well be
that in certain service situations, service-connected
absences, that t .’.era is indeed a severe dislocation.
Assuming that nothing else - happen

though, in terms

of a breakup of the marriage, the fact that in certain
military situations there may be severe dislocations' does not
mean that, there

s a violation of the equal protection clause.

As the Court has pointed out on numerous occasions, that
clause does not

require an absolute, mathematical, precision

in drawing the

lasses, and some inequity is all right.

18

that is, a divorce occurs as a result of the father being
drafted; the child world tYten become eligible*

California's

position is that nilitary absence by itself is insufficient,
but if the other factors, such as a divorce, a breakup of the
marriage, occur, then the family would be in the situation
which we believe Congress intended to cover by AFDC.
But in the normal situation, where the only thing
that exists to arguably give rise to eligibility is the father's
absence by reason of his employment, be it military or
civilian, then California does not grant assistance, and we
do not believe that either the Social Security Act or the
Fourteenth Amend, ant requires.that result.
X have a few moments left, Mr* Chief Justice, I*d
like to reserve them for rebuttal.
MB. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

■
You may do that.

Very well.
Miss Massey.
ora:

argument of miss carmen

L. MASSEY,

ON BEHALF OF THF APPELLEES
MISS MASSEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court s
The issues that are presented for this Court in this
case, and the st uctures within which they are presented, are
straightforward.
The Federal Social Security Act of 1935 provided for

the implementation of the APDC program.

Under that statute ■,

States which provide financial assistance to families with
what are called dependent children may be provided Federal
matching funds —

will be provided Federal.matching funds.

The Fe -oral Social Security Act further defines a
dependent child

one "who has been deprived of parental

support or care :>y reason of the death, continued" —
Q

May 1 interrupt you there, Miss Massey?

MISS MASSEY:
Q

Yes.

Where is it that

does the statute expressly

leave to the State's the definition of "continued absence from
the home"?
MISS MASSEYs

Q

Y.s.

Our argument is that it does not.

The District Court suggested that it did.

I just wonder what provision, they don't cite anything that
they refer to wh.n they say that.
MISS

4.SSEY;

Your Honor, 1 think the District Court

opinion is somer :iat ambiguous on that subject.
Howeve

in light of the rest of the opinion, I think

what the Distrie . Court was saying was that the State must
determine on an '.rtdividual basis as to whether or not continued
absence exists i . a particular case, including in the military
service case.
Q

A id it cannot —
Now, there isn't any doubt, I gather, that HEW

Regulations sugr :st that States do have discretion in the

20
definition of continued absence from the borne.

Is that so?

MISS M.ASSEY ? That is correct.
However, in -light of the Townsend case , which
expressly disapp roved of HEW * s, what is known as the condition
X.
Q

Y'3s.

MISS M ISSEY:

X think that is no longer a proper

interpretation by HEVf.
Q

I

3422.2, is that condition X?

MISS MISSEY:
Q

Is that

Pardon?
is the one that deals here with the

interpretations, HEW Regulation, the one. I was talking about,
is that condition X?

Miss MISSEY:

I think it is, Your Honor.

0

I see.

Q

It is one of them.

SEY:

I believe that it is a part of the

condition X, whi <h was expressly disapproved by this Court in
Townsend v. Swank.
The co .irt below found that

well, California has

further defined the term "dependent child” by providing that
when

a needy chiId is deprived of parental support or care by

reason of the co itinued absence of a parent, and that absence
i'3 occasioned by his military service, there is no continued
absence such as to give rise to dependency and AFDC eligibility.

$*he

vc-~>

on. two grounds;

below found this State regulation invalid
one, that the Social Security Act mandate tha

all eligible ird:' viduals be granted AFDC benefits with
reasonable promptness; and, Ho. 2, that the Department of
Health, Educatio; , and Welfare, in. its implementing regulation
mandated, that fch

States, in developing their policy as to

what constitutes continued absence from the home, must take
into consideration military absence.

And tha court further

read this to provide that the States must consider each cas®
on its individual merits and not on the basis of the group to
which the case belongs.
I would add at this point that the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare, through the Solicitor
General, has filed a brief in this case, indicating that it
agrees with appellants1 argument, that the States are free to
define continued absence from the home as they choose, but
indicating that It disagrees with appellants1 argument that
military orphans? as we have called them, are not federally
eligible for AFC 2 benefits.
And it is the 'second argument that I would like to
address myself to first.
We sub dt that when the Congress used the word
"continued absen :-c- from the home", that it meant exactly what
the plain Engl is :• definition of those words is.
said 11 continued

When Congress

bsenca from the home11, it meant those

22
situations in which a parent is not physically present in the
home and this non-presences can be expected to continue for a
certain length of time, which it called continued.
I would point out, as an example of what continued
absence means, toe situation of the Remillard family in this
case.

Mr. Remillard was in Vietnam for over a year.

During

the time he was in Vietnam, he was not allowed to return to his
family, his family was not allowed to go and visit him.

By

Army Regulation, the family was not even allowed to move to a
point where they would be near him.
this case, whatever

I mean, certainly in

continued* absence" might mean, it was

present here, an i I would point out that the State has
stipulated that
Q

.here was continued absence in this case.
What if he had been over there as our Ambassador

to South Vietnam'?’
MISS MASSEY: And if his family had been free to join
him?
Q

No.

MISS MASSEY: Ail right.

If Mr. Remlilard had been

the Ambassador,

nd if his family were not free to join him,

and if, by some

nance, that family were also needy, that is,

according to the California definition, "unable to provide the
basic necessities of life”, then I would say yes, that family
would fee eligib.l •. for AFDC benefits.
Of con :se, in the case of an Ambassador, it is highly

23

unlikely that the family would fee financially needy,
Q

Well, while I've interrupted you, is there

anything nowadays; in the military service that requires the
serviceman to make an allotment to dependents?
MISS MASSEY:

. In four grades, E-l, E~2, F-3, and

E~4 p the regulations provide that the serviceman may initiate
the basic allotment, which consists of the basic allowance for
quarters, which :.s called the BAp and which is separate from
the serviceman's pay, and which also includes $40 per month,
which is taken out of the serviceman’s pay.
Mow, if the —
0

You say he may do that? right?

MIES MASSEY:

Well, the regulations provide that he

may; but they further provide that if he does not, and if the
wife objects, that certain procedures will be followed to
insure that she does receive her allotment.
Q

From his pay or from some other?

MISS MASSEY: From the same sources.

The $105 for

grades E-l , E-2, and E--3, slightly more for grade E-4, which
comes from outside his pay and $40 which comes from within his
pay.
Now, there is also a provision in the allotment
system that the serviceman may voluntarily add more to this
allotment, but we are here concerned with cases where the
amount of money

.hat is coming from the serviceman is inadequate

24
to care for the basic needs of his family.
Q

1:\ avery ease, whan the parent is absent, the

constant factor re a demonstration of need, is it not?
MISS MASSEY:
Q

Yes.

Sr- that no benefits could be paid if the man

were employed at a substantial income, no matter how lonq he
was absent?
MISS MASSEY s And if that money were actually coming
in to the child? that is correct, Your Honor.
The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
interpretation of the term **continued absence" follows this
common-sense appr oach as to what the terra means.

The Depart­

ment of Health, h'ducation, and Welfare, in its Section 3422,2
of the Handbook of Public Assistance Administration, Part IV,
has defined '’continued absence from the home" ass
the. parent, is ou

of the home."

"One, when

That is'the clear situation

here.
"Two, when the nature of the absence is such as
either to interrupt or to terminate the parent’s functioning
as a provider of: maintenance, physical care, or guidance for
the child."

And I would point out. here the Department of

Health, Educatio:?, and Welfare is concerned not only with the
fact that the farher is not able to adequately support his
family financially, but with the fact that the father is not
presently in the home to provide tha kind of physical care and

23
emotional nurturemce that the child needs.
HEW ha:

one further considerations

"When the known

or indefinite’ du ration of the absence precludes counting on

the parent's per .’ormance of his function in planning for the
r care of the child»'5

present support

certainly also the situation we have here.

That i

Gregory Re-mi liar . was in Vietnam for a year.

During that time

he was not avail ible to help take care of the child# to make
plans concerning her future.
The lor.^-•standing interpretation of HEW is that
military orphans are federally eligible for AFDC benefits.

MISS M. rSSEY:

MISS MrISSEY* That's correct, Your Honor.
there are two di• ferent issues hero.

X think

The first one is;

are

the children fed: rally eligible? and the second is# if the
children are fed. rally eligible# then may the States deny them
these bsnefits?
Q

A id about half the States deny them?

KISS M. ISSEY* That is correct# Your Honor.

There

are soma 20*eSd S .ates, plus the District of Columbia# which

I

26
do grant benefits to all needy military orphans.
Q

So if T'O affirm here * those States that are not

now doing it wi3J have to?
MISS Ml.SSEY2

Yes, Your Honor.

The States also make some further distinctions.

For

example,at the tine we filed this case there were two States,
and there is now one State that gives AFOC benefits to the
needy children of draftees but not to the needy children of
enlistees.
There are two further States which grant &FDC
benefits to the needy children of draftees or men who have
enlisted in order to avoid the draft, but not to the needy
children of men who have enlisted.
Q

You mean the very — the needy children of

really patriotic soldiers don't, get it?
MISS MISSEY:
Q

That's right.

Kow was this — during World War XI, when there

were literally millions of men, many of whom

were fathers, in

the armed services, was the division among the States about
the same as it is now?

MISS M1.SSBY 3
question, Your Honor.

I do not know the answer to that

KISS

mi.ssey3

it?
That is correct.

X don't know what the

2?
division of States was at that time.
The AFdC program focuses on the child. This was
stated by this Court in the case of King v. Smith and has been
reiterated several times.

What is important is the status of

the child, not the legal status of the parents.
Now, a regulation such as California has can lead to
certain very absurd results.

As an. example of this, I would

point out the situation of the intervenor in this case, Joyce
Faye Dones.

Prior to intervention in this action, Joyce Dones

and her husband and her two children were living together; she
was also expecting a third child.

Mr. Dones was working full

time and supporting his family.
Mr. Dones was then ordered to submit to induction
into the Army, and ha was then sent to his basic training.
By Amy Regulation, his family was not allowed to join him at
the site of the basic training.
Now, if Mr. Dones, instead of submitting to induction,
if he had refused induction and then subsequently been arrested,
convicted, and sentenced for this unlawful act, there is no
question but that in California his children would have been
eligible for AFDC benefits.
Now, as far as the child is concerned, there probably
wouldn't have been much difference.

In each case the father

would have been gone for a certain length of time? if he was
in jail, oho would more likely be able to visit the father.

28
And If he was in jail, he probably didn't have as many chances
of being killed; but yet, in one case, the child is eligible
for APDC benefit?: and in the other case the child is not
eligible.
Q

Well, the father isn't making much in prison?

that's one fundamental difference.
MISS MASSEY: That is correct, Your Honor, except for
the fact that in this case need is not in question.

By the

standards developed by the California Department of Social
Welfare, our class is composed only of needy children, children
who aren't getting anything.
2ind 1 would further point out that in the case of
Nancy Reinillard, when we first filed this action, she wasn't
getting anything, either? she wasn't getting any allotment.
Q

Well, what if he was living at home when he was

in the military?

And he was not making enough to satisfy the

standard of need?
MISS M&SSBY: We do not contend that the family would
have been eligible for AFDC benefits, under this —
Q

But it would be just as irrational, vzouldn't

it?
MISS MASSEY:

We are dwelling here on the statutory

argument —
Q

Well, I understand that, but you are also

arguing about other situations that you claim, in comparison,

29

ars rational.

Wall, 7. —

MISS M ISSEY:

Okay.

If the father were living at

home, there are if course certain economies of living, of
maintaining only one household; and also the father would be
available to halo with the physical care of the children.

He

would be available to provide guidance and possibly, in some
situations, he would be able to take a second job.
Q

Well, if he’s in prison, there's one less mouth

to feed, too, though, isn't there?
MISS MASSEY:

Yes.

I would like to point out that in California, if a
husband is sent to jail and if ha is released under the work
furlough program

which is a procedure whereby the husband goes

to work and then returns to jail for the night, or for the day
if he happens to be working the night shift, even in a case like
this where the husband is employed, the family will foe granted
AFDC benefits, based upon his absence, if the family is in fact
needy.
And X think this is very close to the servicemen's
situation.
Q

Has there been any congressional —* any

;

proposals in the Congress to have a statutory definition of
continued absence* that would bear on this situation?
MISS MASSEY:

Mo, Your Honor.

2 would only point out

that Congroas in currently considering and has been considering

30
for some time th ; Family Assistance Program, and one of the
provisions in that program is that the families who are
assisted must he in fact families living together, and —
Q

Bvit in the past, there haven't been some

proposals to provide a national standard for aid to military
people that have either been adopted — well, they haven't
been adopted, obviously, but they've been rejected.

There

haven't been any proposals like that during any session?
MISS MASSE?:

1 don't know of any proposals that

deal specifically with the military problem,

1 would note

that Congress has seemingly acquiesced in the HEW definition,
which does include'military orphans.
Q

Ar.d under which definition the States can do it

either one way or the other?
MISS MASSEY:
to that definition.

Well, we maintain there are two parts

The first part is that they are eligible,

and the second part is what we maintain has been ~~
0

Well, HEW certainly doesn't think its definition

requires the State to give aid, at least that's what their
brief says.
MISS MASSEY: That’s correct, Your Honor.

At this

point we are only dealing with whether or not they are
federally eligible.

And the second part of the argument is

concerned with vt ether or not this case is outside th® scope

o£ Townsend v. Swank*

31
Q

I notice HEW suggests that this whole problem

might perhaps more appropriately be handled as a responsibility
of the Military Pay .and .Allotment System.
MISS M ISSEY:

Your Honor, we would agree that the

Military Pay and Allotment System could be much more equitable.
Q

Well, I take it that there must be some situa­

tions where oven if 100 percent of the soldier’s salary were
remitted home under an allotment, it still wouldn't be enough
to meet the family standard of need, would it?
MISS MASSEYj
correct.

Oh, yes, Your Honor, that is absolutely

And there is also the problem that even if the

soldiers9 pay were raised to $10,009 a year, there are always
going to occur situations like Kancy Remillard found herself
in.

She wasn’t getting any money.

Somehow the allotment

system had broken down, and she didn't have any money, not
even this very low sum that the militarii' does send normally.
Q

Well, would it be so difficult — I’ll put the
i’’

question to you 1 put to counsel for the State — to administratively determine what was the difference between the fair
allotment, the maximum allotment that could be made and the
amount that the Itate could pay?
MISS MASSEY:

Your Honor, our contention is that
/

this would be very simple to administer.

And I would compare

it to the situation where you have parents who arc separated
by agreement.

32
In fcha. kind of a situation? you frequently find a
father who is ab iimt but who returns to the horae, to visit
the children? to see his wife, for whatever reason; and there's
& real administrative problem for the department to determine

whether he's in or whether he’s out.

Let alone how ranch money

he's giving her? when his payments vary.
But in the military situation, it's very easy to
check that he's cut, and it's easy to check when he's going to
be coming back.

And it's also very easy to check what the

allotment is going to be, because the regulations are so
standardized that once the welfare worker knows what his level
in the service is? she can determine how much money the family
is going to receive.
Q

But if he's then stationed near home, and living

off the base? the welfare would stop?
HISS M&3SEY;
on its merits.

Each case would have to be determined

That’s all that we're arguing here today, is

that each case must be determined on its merits.
I would say that if he was living off the base? the
family was there, then, no, he would not be eligible for
benefits.
Q

Although if they switched him to Seattle, they

would get welfare? even though he was sending them all the
allotment that you could expect?
MISS MA3SEY:

Your Honor, that's the point where you

33
have to determin . each case individually, because there might
be certain situations whore the family could not live with him
in Seattle.

The.a might be other situations where the family

could.
X believe the District Court pointed out this kind of
a problem,.
Q

Incidentally, Mr. Linderman suggested that the

District Court was wrong in saying that there were other
classifications than absence from the home that California
handles on an individual basis.
This is the group basis, but X think he said the
children of prisoners are handled as a group, not on an
individual case basis»
MISS KISSEY:

Well, 1' would disagree with that.

Even

in those categories the families have to be treated on an
individual basis.

It may be that one person goes to‘jail for

a day, and that doesn't qualify his family for AFDC assistance.
It may be that another father goes to jail for a year, and
his family would be qualified.

In each case you have to

determine whether or not the parent io actually continually
absent from the route.

That’s all we’re asking in this case,

that our clients be given the chance to show that there is an
actual ncn-phy&ioal presence of a father in the home»
G

h -;11, 1 understood Mr. Linderman to say that

California treat-j fathers who are absent from the home, either

34
becaurn they*re employed away from the home or are seeking
employment away

rom the home, just as it does milifcary

personnel? that :

excludes them as a group.

Dici I mi sunder sian

that?
MISS MASSEY?

Mo, I believe that is correct,

I was

answering the question as to whether all groups are considered
as a group or whether, within certain groups, the individuals
are allowed to present their cases; individually,
Q

Bit at least that group of fathers employed in

a civilian capacity of one kind or another away from home,
or who are seeking employment, civilian employment, non-military
employment away from home, are excluded as a group from
parents absent, continually absent from home.

Is that correct?

MISS MASSEY: That is correct. Your Honor.
Q

Jv.sfc an military —

MISS MASSEY:

As military men are.

The second part of California's argument is an attempt
to distinguish this case from the Townsend case.

Now, in the

Townsend case, this Court further enunciated the principle of
King vs. Smith, t~ hich was that at least in the absence of
congressional authorisation for the exclusion, clearly evidenced
in the Social Security Act or its legislative history, a State
eligibility standard that excludes person eligible for
assistance under federal AFDC standards violates the Social
S e cur:L ty Ac fc,

33
Now, 1 don't think we have anything in the record to
show that Congre a meant to exclude needy military orphans
from the coverage of the APDC Act»

Q

Your conclusion from that is that continued

absence must have one definition countrywide?
MISS MASSEY:

Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

U1SS KISSEY: And if there is ambiguity in this
« *

definition, that it must be supplied by the Department of
Health, Educatio-i, and Welfare, subject to reinterpretation by

Wall, that means — that would mean that any —-

funds, would mean that those children for which it matched
funds were eligible, and every other State would have to
conform to the State that had the highest level of eligibility
in its plan?
MISS MASSEY; That is correct, Your Honor.
I would compare this case to the Kinsj case.

In the

King case this Court was concerned with, what does the word
"parent” mean?
How, the word "parent" is certainly as ambiguous as
the

"continued absence from the horns", yet in that case

tiiic. Court looked at the legislative history and at the Act to
e/st ermine; vial

parent" meant.

And once it determined what

36
"Parent" meant, it held that the States were bound to provide
AFDC benefits to all children who fell within the definition.
Q

Weil, that doesn't help you much in this case,

does it?
MISS MASSEY:
C

Your Honor, I believe ■—

Because here you'd have to look and find

legislative history or something in the Act to show that
Congress meant to include military people.
MISS MASSEY:

Yes, Your Honor, that was the first

part of the argument, and we used, to support that claim, the
interpretation oi HEW and the plain English language of the
words —
Q

Yes, but if you're wrong on that, is that all

you have to rely on?
MISS MASSEY;

Your Honor, if we are wrong, and

Congress meant —
Q

Bet HEW certainly doesn’t think that it used

any words in the regulation that support your view?
MISS MASSEY:

Your Honor, it does as far as the

initial issue, which is whether or not these children are
federally eligible.

That is, if California chose to provide

benefits to thee-.: children, are federal matching funds avail­
able?
And the position of HEW is quite clear:

federal

matching funds are available.

Sacause they provide sonte 20 to 25 States now?

you. raise any constitutional questions?

HISS MASSE?*

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe that the

court below quit. : properly decided this ease on statutory
grounds.

However, we did argue below, and we argue here,

that if — that the California regulation does deny Nancy
Remillard and ths members of her class the equal protection
and due process of the law, as guaranteed by ths Fourteenth
Amendment•
We would point out that California provides AFDC
benefits to children in which a parent is absent from the
home because of livoree, desertion, separation, incarceration,
deportation, hospitalisation} it does not provide benefits for
the child whose varent is separated from the home because of
military absence.
Q

Nor for the child whose parent is away for

civilian employment.
MISS KISSEYs

Or for a child whose parent is away

for civilian employment.
Yet, in a program where the focus is on the child,
the situation of the child is the same in any of these cases.
'fJie California exclusion, it cannot be viewed as
dmply a. case where the State would not provide benefits if

the absence is voluntary, because the State provides benefits
in the case of tie voluntary divorce and voluntary separation.
It cannot fee looked at as a case in which the absence is going
to be for a known time rather than an unknown time. Because
the State does provide the APDC benefit® when a parent is
absent from the home for as little as 30 days because of
incarceration.
And it further cannot be locked at as a general
exclusion from the AFDC program of children V7bc have some money
coming in to the:a, in the case of divorce or desertion.

There

may foe regular child support payments coming in.
But if the difference between the child —- but the
State will pay the difference between the child support payment
and the standard of need as determined by the State.
That's all that we're asking
this case.

that the State do in

That it pay the difference between what the child

is getting and what the State says that child needs to live
on.
Q

Wall now, if Congress had said specifically

in the Act, "cor. :.:inued absence, but the States have the
discretion of whether or not to include military people", would
you be here?
MISS MASSEY:
Q

Yes, Your Honor,

On the constitutional argument?

MISS MISSEYi

Yes

39
Q

Not on the statutory argument?

MISS MASSBYs That's correct.

C

•

Bat even though ora the statutory argument if

half the States 'covered military people and half the States
didn’t? ui.ilits.ry people are eligible?
MISS MASSEY:
Q

Yes.

Which is the way it is now?

MISS MASSEY;. Yes.
Your Honor, I would point out that Congress, in
enacting the AFDO-U program under Section 407 of the Act, it
specifically provided that the States would define the term
"unemployment".

It did not do that in the case of "continued

absence".
0

Well, I take it that HEWs position is that

by-using this general terra, and against the history, the 33year history, that it’s just as though the Congress had said
expressly that the States may have discretion, and even —
and thus, even though military people, children are eligible,
it doesn't .mean there's a violation of the Act in those States
where they are declared ineligible?
MISS MASSEY;
0

That's basically their position?

MISS MASSEY:

the state.

Yea, Your Honor, —

— that's the position of HEW and of

We £< si that that ignores the plain holding and the

plain language of the Townsend case, in which this Court

40
expressly repudiated the position of the Department of. Health,
Education, end Welfare, that it could delegate to the States
the decision whether or not to participate in certain programs.
As far as the constitutional argument is concerned,
we further maintain that the State, by its conclusive presump­
tion, that a parant is not absent from the horns when everybody
admits the father is absent from the home, has denied to the
appellees the due process of the law.
I would emphasise at this point that we are not
stating that in

very single case where there is a needy child

and where there is military service that that family is eligible
for APDC benefits* We are only stating that, or we are only
asking that this Court hold that the State of California cannot,
by a conclusive .iresumption, prevent the members of this class
from proving what everybody knows is. true,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY

s.

LINDERMAN, ESQ-,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LIUDERMAN:

May I just refer briefly to the

TOwnffend decision, to respond to what Miss Massey says that
the decision holla; and X don’t mean to be presumptions in
telling the Court what it held in that case*

But X believe

that it*® difficult to read the decision as having any
applicability hsvo, in that in Townsend Congress had very

clearly defined what a student was, In terms of who, as a
student, was going to be eligible.
The Court then said that Cone;

Ing squarely •

made the person eligible, the State can’t say that the person
is ineligible? and it's only in that context, 1 believe, that,
the Court struck down HEW's condition X.

And condition X is

merely the deference, the deferential policy of HEW in this
case and in any other case of allowing States to define
eligibility for that State's program.
How, I don’t believe that the Court in Townsend struck
down condition X in all instances.
Wow, t xiit’s my point, that in this case the Court may
want to — in the Remillard case, the Court may choose to say
that there must

ds

national standards.

And in this case may

disapprove in tola condition X, but it did not do so, we would
submit, in the Townsend case.
One £.1 ..al point.

That the Administration’s Welfare

Reform Bill-, H» :u 1, which is now pending and has been for
soma time, one of the most highly touted aspects of that bill
'is that it establishes nationally uniform standards, one of
the things lacking in AFDC.
So X would submit that clearly AFDC does not —
under the Social Security Act does not require national
standards? particularly in this case where Congress has used
the vagus term "continued absence” and deferred to HEW for 35

42
years in allowing the States to set their own definitions.
