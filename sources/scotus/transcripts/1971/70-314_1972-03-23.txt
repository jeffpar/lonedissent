GRILL ARGUMENT OF J. PIERRE KOLXSCH, ESQ. (
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR., ROLISOHs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
TL-5 question presented for review is which of two
federal venue statutes control in a patent infringement suit.
One of them, 1391(d) is the venue statute which
controls venue generally.

And this states that an alien may

ha sued in any district.
The other statute, 1400(h), specifically covers
the situation in patent infringement action, and it provides
that such an action may be brought in the district where the
defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts
of infringement and has a regular and established place of
business.
0

&-ow, with reference to that last phrase of the

statute, both feetors must be present, is that correct?
MR. KOLISCH:

Yes, it is "and a regular and

established place of business."
■G ?c-v.

in the -particular case which the Court now

has before i „ that

siraii'i''.:-'.

Xg

v

■ . ...

venue statute?

The thing that is

ibe iilr-rcosy or bn© Special
Mow, this Court has passed on this special

venue statute , which is now known as 1400(b), three tiroes.
There have born three different occasions in which the Court
was asked to expand venue in patent cases.
Weil,, would you explain for me why it isn’t

q

important?

The last, part of it.
MR. KGLXSCH:

It is not important in this case

because there isn’t any question that under the special venue
statute the defendant here is clear.

In other words, if the

special venue statute controls, there is no venue? if the
general venue statute controls, there is venue.
So it’s just a question of may an alien — you see,
we represent o. Canadian defendant, and it’s a question of
whether nr alien may bs sued any place under the general
venue statuta» or may the defendant claim the special, venue
statute.
How, there is no argument that we do not, that the
defendant dees not qualify under the special venue statute.
So v/e have a situation heres

which controls, general venue or

special venue?

q

V7aat*?3 the consequence on venue if your position

is correct?
ms.

sSLXSCH:

If ay position is correct, we are not

5
subject to suit.

Q

I nywhere • in the United States?

. MR. KOLISCH:
Q

Correct.

Therefore it seems to me to cut the other way,

that it is very important in your case,
MR. Ti X.ISCE s

X thought you asked me, Mr, Justice

Blackraun, wr-.ethvr or not, if we had a regular and established
place of business and whether or not we had committed acts
of infringement here, were important.

For the purposes of

this case, we have agreed, that we do not have a regular and
established placo of business, and we have not committed acts
of infringement.

Tn other words, if special venue controls, we're not
covered.

Me're out.

Xf general venue controls, we are;

because we ©re e.n alien.
Q

Eut the consequence of your position in that

an American party in claiming infringement would be without any
remedy, is that not correct?
MR. KCLXSCH%

Xfc is possible that in certain limited

situations, and we’re willing to assume it for the purposes of
this case, ther: may be a certain class of defendants in
infringement cev.es who are not subject to an infringement suit
in the United States.

You've stated it completely correctly,

Mr. Chief Justice.
But w

have to go back and take a look at the history

6
of the

e,.:evv.tt.te, which was first passed is. 1897,

and see ••■•hat

pei-ei and what this Court did with respect to

this statute.
Now, the Court hold, in the three prior cases, that
the special venue statute controlled as to ail defendants $ and
I emphasise the word t!ailta because it was emphasised by the
Court»

It made no —
Q

In each of those cases, Mr. Kolisch, there was

a district, in the United States; where they could have been
sued, was there not?
MR. KCLISCH:

Correct,

This is the factual

difference between the present case and all the other casos
which the Court has considered? namely, the Court was dealing
with domestic defendants.
Now, the principle which we say governs those cases
is still the same.

In other words, it is our position that

the Act of 1897, which is the predecessor of 1400(b), and
this is the particular statute you have before you.

In that

Act the Congrer:-'. very clearly, unequivocally, as this Court has
stated, said thet special venue is going to control with
respect to all defendants, irregardless of whether or not
they are domestic or alien.
Now, the basic fact, in the present case is that the
defendant Brunette is a Canadian corporation.

It was sued

in the United St rvt&s D.-v tricfc Court for the District of Oregon

for

The Brunette motion -~

Q

Bow was jurisdiction obtained?

MR, KCLSSCHs

Jurisdiction obtained under a — there8s

i' long line of statutes? so that there isn’t any quarrel about
jurisdiction.
The motion to dismiss was granted.

The Ninth

Circuit reversed, based on a decision which had previously
fcscm handed down in the Southern District of New York, which
1« known as the Pfizer case.

The Ninth Circuit expressly

declined to follow at\ prior decision by the Seventh Circuit in
the Coulter case, in which basically the same factual
situation had been presented? namely, an alien defendant
claiming improper venue.

The Seventh Circuit had examined

the prior decisions of this Court and cams to the conclusion
that venue was improper.
Q

'JSnd Judge Mansfield, in the Pfizer case, refused
4C*L.a&HL

to follow that cf the Seventh Circuit, too?
MR, KCLISCH?

Yes.

Yes.

And Judge Mansfield

refused to follow, and expressly mentioned it.
Our position is now that the problem with the whole
line of cases,

?nc! there have been, district court cases which

have followed v: :f;o:;eo.

But fchsv’re based on an erroneous line

of district coali; cases? aril it is our position that those
cases fail to appreciate what happened in 189/ when Congress

passed the first special venue statuta„
New, at that time the court, this Court had already
decided two cases involving alien defendants.

Che first ease

was the I-Iohorsfc case in 1893, and that case involved a German
arlien in a patent infringement case, and the Court said:;
alien is subject, to suit any placa.
Subsequently, in 1895, Keasbey & Mattison came along,
decided by this Court, and Keasbey a Mattison confirmed Hohorst
An alien as well as a domestic — Keasbey
an alien case.

&.

Mattison was not

But both these cases stood for the proposition

that a defendant in a patent infringement case, you can sue him
any place you can get service on him.
So, the Act of 1897 was then passed.

It is our

position that if overruled those cases, because Congress, whan
it passed the 1897 Act, was well aware of the decisions of this
Court in Sohorsi. and Keasbey & Mattison for that which they
stood.
Now, mind you, Hohorst did stand for the proposition
that an alien could be sued any place.
Q

Mr. Kolisch, I could find in your brief and in

your opponent's brief and in the amicus briefs no indication
of any legislative history, since 1 thought the briefs would
have that? but there really isn’t any legislative history on

the subject.
MR* UJO'iVlSCE*

Hs. Justice Rehnquist, if you are

referring to the legislative history with respect to the 848 .
or the 1897 Act?
Q

The 1897.

MR. KOLISCHs

The IBS? Act.

There is legislative

history, and it's set forth rather fully in this Court’s
opinion in Stonlbe, which is the first case.
decided in 1942.

This was

There's a footnote in Stonite, and they go

into it rather fully, what was going on at the time that the

1897 Act was passed, and it is the consensus that the 1897 Act
was passed to take care of abuses which had grown in patent
infringement cases.
Q

But did that history have any significant

references to either Hohorst or Reasbey?
MR. KOLXSCH:

The history does hot indicate any

specific reference to Hohorst or Keasbey, but in the Stonfte
case the Court does discuss Hohorst and Keasbey, recognizing
the situation with respect to Hohorst and Keasbey, and then
goes 031 to say that:

We decide that the special venue statute

is the only statute controlling, and it excluded everything
before it.
Now, X admit Stonite was still a domestic defendant,
there was not an alien, defendant in Hohorst..

However, in the

Otontfee decision, which goes into the history rather fully,

.10
Honorat» .ud nil the other cases, and the lower court
ea ts, and the confusion that existed among the lower courts
with respect to this question of venue in patent infringement
is examined, and the Court says;

Congress passed the 189?

hot to set the record straight, and make it clear that special
venue controlled in all infringement cases.
He-.?, the next time that the Court had the 'question
before it was in the Fourco case in 1957.;?

the specific

question presented to the Court in Fourco was whether 1391(c),
which provided that a corporation can be sued in any judicial
district in which it is doing business, was supplementary to
1400(b).
Now, st the time that the Court decided Fourco, 1957,
the 1948 revisi.cn to the Judicial Code had taken place, and
it was at that time that the subsections which we are consider­
ing, and specifically 1391(d), were added to the law.
The approach which the Court took in Fourco was;

the

holding in StOnlte that the special venue statute controls and
is exclusive is still good law unless there was some change in
the 1948 revision to the Judicial Code.
Again X say that * a when section (c) and (d) were added.
The Court wac specifically considering (c) in Sfconite.
The Court came to the conclusion, and it again
reviewed the history of the 1948 revision and what had happen®-'before, that fclure had been no intended change in the law, and

that therefore luMCb/ remained controlling as to all
defendants ia patent infringement cases, and that 1591 Co)

should not Kv aaad as supplementary to 1400(b)«
xhv- levit tiiaa that this Court tad the question

before it vaa in 1961, and that was in the gchnell case.
Again the Co-art aria fly reviewed the history, came to the
conclusion, as it had in the other two cases, it reaffirmed
its decisions ia Sfconite and Fourco,- namely, that 1400(b) is
the exclusive provision controlling venue in patent
infringements*
dnd the Court specifically said in Schnel 1 that the
A-

attempts to broaden patent venue were contrary to the
congressional intent and, as far as the Court was concerned,
would involve judicial legislation.
Now, this point was well understood —
Q

the Stonite footnote certainly doesn't deal

with the particular issue in this case, does it?

The legis­

lative history as to the Act of 1897 in terms.
MR. KOLISCMs

In terms of alien, it does not.

It

quotas from what Mr. Mitchell had to say; however, you will
note, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that Hohorst is discussed in the
footnote of Stonite.

Stonite, of course, dealt with a

domestic; but ichorsh was recognised at the time that the
Court was x-enCoring its opinion, as it was in 1897 when the Acv;

was passed.

Q

E::.t Mr» Mitchell *s remarks don't deal with

Hohorst at all.
MR. KOX.;lSCvi i
Hohorst.

No.

Mr. Mitchell did not talk about

Hcvsv&r, the Court, when it wrote Stonite, had Hohorst

in mind»
Now, it's our position that an alien, just like a
domestic defendant, who is involved in a patent case, that
this doesn't justify a change in the interpretation below,
which this Court has had for the last 75 years.
Now, the principal argument which is urged on this
Court, and which apparently carried the day before Judge
Mansfield, was- that

reviser’s note to 1391(d), and they

emphasised that in the Forres case 1400(b) had not -- that
this had not teen fully appreciated by this Court when it
wrote Fourco, as by the Coulter case.
Now, this note says that the new subsection gives
"statutory recognition to the weight of authority concerning
..« which there has been a sharp conflict”, and then cites two
district court cases.

These were both out of the Ohio District

Court, which Judge Westenhaver had decided in 1917 and 1918.
Now, this, we submit, is not an indication of a
change in the ic.w, because in 1948, when the Judicial Code was
revised, 139.1(d) being added, it was merely a codification of
the law that generally, and this was the law generally
recognised, that an alien could be sued in any district where

13
service cove 1 i* effected.
ii i '

iit

Bud that's what 1391(d) stood for»
or modify 1400(b) , which had beau

in existence in a prior form since 1897, which still controlled
in patent cases»
Mow, if it had been the congressional intent in
1958, when 1391 i) was to change this we11-established law,
our submission i s that there would have been an appropriate
revision, obvior:sly, in the patent statute»

Something would

have been said to the effect, "except as aliens” or in. some
situations such as that.
Now, the Court's decision in Stonite that special
venue is ihe sole provision governing in patent cases, we say
supports the position we have taken.
had this before it and has said:

The Court has repeatedly

Well, Congress simply said

that as far as all defendants in patent cases are concerned,
they are a special class.

It's our position that if there's

going to be a change in the law in 1948 — and, by the way,
the revisers to the evade say there wasn't any change in the
1948 revision, that this was a revision, this was the
codification of the lav? as it stood — there certainly would
have been a more positive, a stronger statement than this
rather ambiguous note which was appends© to 1391(d).
Q

Mr. Kolisch, what would be the — help me out

on this — what would be the policy behind your analysis of
the congressi arrd approach?

Why should patent defendants be

14

fraatod differently than otiar interests?
Mt„ KO&XSC3s

Thia went; back to the 189V Act, and

at that timv. it was fait that defendants in patent cases
should, not

a object to cult any place, that there should be

a relationship either where they were inhabitants or where
they had committed acts of infringement, ana had a regular,
established place of business.

A practice had grown up after

the Honorst ■ Eoasfoey 6 Mattison cases, in -which they were being
sued all over the place.

And therefore Congress * s reaction

to that was the special venue statute, and 1 think that9s
brought out in the footnote that Mr. Mitchell had in the Stonlte
case.
This has been the law, and this was the justifica­
tion for it.

'

Q

Of course, coupled with that, then, is complete

coemption from suit for a client such as yours?
What 1 want to get at is the policy behind that.
MR. KOLXSCHs

Yes.

I am not urging on the Court

that the Congress intended delib

itely to exempt any

particular type of defendant, let’s say, such- as an alien.

1 will assume that under 1400(b) and that under
certain circumstances aliens, and a certain type of alien,
v; cl for the purpose of this argument, my client might not be

subject to

it in any district, because it doesn’t quality

under 1400 <!:•>}.

Because the strongest argument that plaintiff

15

,1c that; Kus it the congressional intent

that

:

was the congressional intent»

raay have been a gap.

iioj 1

/ ,.

I think there

i think that, possibly Congress had not

considered the matter, and the fact, of course, in that the
thing that reowf Judge Mar afield and certain otior of the
courts was to say, well now, here are a group of defendants
who can with Irq.signlty infringe patents and «end infringing
articles into the United States.
Well, of course, that simply Isn't the case,

as a

practical matter, a patent owner can bring suit against persons
who makes, uses, or sells.

So if he can’t get the maker, he

can get the uses:-, and seller, all of whom are in this
country.
Furthermore, of course, under the Tariff Act, and
one of the decisions we cite points out that Congress was
wall aware of fsa situation and it decided it was going to take
car® of the thing through the Tariff Act.

Section 337 of

the Tariff Act says that if there is an infringement of a
United States pc taut, you go through the Treasury Department
and you can stop it at every port of entry.
Q

That doesn’t give them any damages - though,

does it?
MR. KCLISCHi

Mo.

But it does give him the oppor­

tunity to stop cxiy importation, and it has the additional

16
preteeUic-n inoi hs novor Loo to so;bjeat his patent to a question
of validity# bonuose during the Tariff proceedings# unless the
patent has been declared invalid, it is presumptively valid.
So this defense can't be raised in the Tariff proceedings.
So it is our position that this concern of the
certain lower court cases with respect to what will happen is
more imaginary than real.
Q

Hr* Koliseh, am I right in thinking that in

order for you to prevail hare, we must ba satisfied that the
Act of 1807 overruled Hohorst, and that the 1940 revision did
not change it back again?
MR. KOLSSCHs

Precisely»

And X would submit to the Court that there may be a
gap, as Mr# Justice Eehncmist, x think, suggested.

Certainly

there wasn’t congressional intent to ©reuse, but once you
analyse what went on, you will see that the court repeatedly,
and Congress,even where- it had the matter brought to its
attention, never did anything about it.
Now, it may

Well, have there been judicial decisions under

1400 —-no, unde* the predecessor to 1400, Section 48, that
an alien could La sued anywhere?
MR., KOLXSCH:

decisions which came, out of the district court of the District
of Ohio.

anything different than Section 48, settled that conflict
one way or the other?
MR. KOLXSCf:

Actually the conflict had been settled

Mr. Justice Rehnquist mentioned that the earlier

cases, they are all baaed on Hohorst.

The 1893 and 1895

decisions of this Court were overruled by the 189? Act.

And

the 1897 Act, of which 1400(b) is a descendant, simply held that
in all patent ir.fringentant cases special venue rather than
general venue controlled.

OEM ARGUMENT OF HARRY M. CROSS, JR., ESQ.,
m

MR. CROSSs
pleases

BEHALF OF TEE RESPONDENT
Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

i

18
2 wonder if Congress could not intend the result that

the petitioner is suggesting, whether any vanue statute at all
is required to effect the judicial power of the United States
as promulgated in a federal statute?
What the petitioner is urging is a frustration of
the federal judicial power.

Venue, as I understand it# in a

federal, causa of action is intended to direct the geographical
area where federal judicial power is to be applied.

Not if it* s

going to be applied, but where.
The petitioner is urging the Court to apply very
broad language from the Fourco case, out of contest, and
without regard to the legislative and judicial histories
upon which both the Fourco and the Sionit® .cases were based.

In

bo

far as alien venue is concerned, 1 would like

to suggest that the patent venue statute as originally
promulgated in 189? was not a restrictive statute.

Beginning

with the review presented in the Sionite decision, and
specifically with two .cases cited in the Stonit® decision, at

m

315 U.S. 56?, these cases being the Bauer's

case, 104 Fed.

887, and the Cheatem Electric ease, 191 Fed. 727, at which a
detailed history of the 1897 Act. is presented.
Prior to the first patent venue statute of 1897,
there initially was a general venue statute of 1875, that
provided that & defendant in any case could be sued wherever
he was found.

In.the general venu® statuto of 1887 and 1888,

19
in cases where £ ederal courts had concurrent

that was modified

jurisdiction,, to providing venue for defendants in the district
in which they wore inhabitants.
Now, that’s a substantial limitation over where they
may be found, bit it’s important to note that that general
venus statute

was

strictly limited to cases of concurrent

jurisdiction.
When this Court reached the subject of alien venue
in a patent case in 1891, in the Hohorst decision, they had
first of all said*

there is no expression in the statutes of

1887 and 1838 that venue — that that venue statute applies
to an alien, jtlr.ee there's nothing to indicate that it was
congressional intent that that statute so applied to an alien?
they concluded that it did not, and that an alien could be
sued anywhere„
The second holding in that case, which is most
important, is that a federal patent action, based on a federal
statute, the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction since
the statute of 1887 and 1888 was directed to causas where the
federal courts had concurrent jurisdiction, it simply did not
apply in a federal patent action.

Therefore, for the second,

reason that statute didn't, apply.
In tlK

Keasbey & Mattlson Supreme Court decision,

they reaffirmed both those points.

It was at that time that

th!z lower circuit courts generally permitted suits against

'

'

-

aliens

or domestics.

Tb/. paceag-a. of the first pstoat venue statute of
139? -eras dire, e'tel toward, 'bee second point in Hohorst.

It was

intended, according to the* Baagra case, to place patent venue
on a par with general vem=.«.

Xt first of all provided that

in patent infringement cases, venue was to be had where the
defendant was an inhabitant.

That is exactly the earns * as was

in tha 1887 and 1880 general venue statutes.
In addition, Congress, provided that an alien -- -.
excuse me, that an infringer could be sued at the place he
infringed and where ha had a regular and established place of
business.
That adds-; another district.

So, to" that extent, it

is broader than the general venue statutes of 1887 and 1888.
Q

Sr. Cross, you say that the Batters case

supports your construction of the hot of 1897? dees the Bauerb
case roly on legislative history, or is it just a statement
in the case that that was tha purpose?
M1U CBOSSs

It*s a statement of the case.

A statesmen

of tha history*
Continuing from the point of 1897, the cases
I^sgg lately following that are substantially contemporaneous
with the bet adapted this point of view, in that the first
prat on which the pahaaet decision was based was not modified.

general v
The t

■

that's cited in our brief, and subsequent to that is the
Sandusky casn that is cited by the reviser in his note to
1391(d) *
Regarding for a moment the Sandusky case:

contrary

to the inference to bo drawn from the petitioner’s reply
brief, the Sandusky case has two decisions, it's a two-point
decision, and the first one definitely holds that an alien in
a patent infringement action is suable wherever he can be found.
It's not indicative, it’s a positive holding.

At the time of this Court's decision in Stonifs, the
general rule, as applied fee venue over aliens, was a judicial
rule, it was not statutory.

These prior lower court decisions

continuing to reapply the Hohorst decision as to the patent
alien venue are not inconsistent with Stonits8s holding.
Stealte» even the language of Stonite, clearly says that the
then patent venue statute, Section 48 of the 1911 Judicial
Cods, that statutory provision is not modified by other
provisions of venue.
provisions.

They’re talking about other statutory

No consideration was given to the judicial rule

©£ venue, whatsoever.
The difficulty it has created in this case is by the
fact that in S’ourco this Court stated that the issue before
w/taMiua:

Fouseo was kvi.Iy indistinguishable from the i.. bef ore
Stoaito.

Bstvraen Ston.ite and. Foarco, however

1391(b)

codified the judicial law on alien verme»

Q

That was the first time that it had been dealt

with by statute?
MR. CROSSi

That's right.

Therefore, by repeating generally the phraseology
of Stonito in FourcoI think inadvertently the language became
too broad.

Because then when you talk in terms of statutory

provisions not being supplertantable, that does not comply with
the previous judicial rule that was codified in 1391(d).
The effect of the request by petitioner is going to
become significantly more important, I thinkr in the future.
The number of recant cases concerned with this problem
reflects an economic change in this country, more and more
new technologies, in whatever form, are going to be imported
into this country rather than vice versa.
That certainly is nothing -- there's nothing objec­
tionable in that.

But it!s certainly true that it's done for

a profit motive, and if aliens can see a profit in importing
their technologies into this country, and by so doing violate a
federal statute, and do it in such a manner that they subject
themselves to the in personem jurisdiction of the federal
courts, it .seems to me incongruous that venue would fca so
ret.rictively interpreted as to oust the subject matter of

23
the f&co-cal courts.

ymWTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. PIERRE KOLISCH, ESQ.,

OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KOLXSCB:

The statement by this Court in Stonite

I think is quia * illuminating.

It said that "The Act of 189?

was adopted to define the eieaot jurisdiction of the Federal

courts in actions to enforce patent rights and thus eliminate
t'W:' unoertai: by produced by the conflicting decisions on the
applicability of the Act of 1887 as amended to sugh litigation.
rir.t purpose indicates that Congress did not intend the Act of
1897 to dovetail with the. general provisions relating to
the venue of civil suits, but rather that it alone' should

control venue ir patent infringement proceedings.!!
Stay, the Court, in Stonite, was well•aware of the
situation in Hoho'gsfc, because it had just gotten through
quoting a long footnote, and Echoret was the case which had
discussed venue with respect to aliens.

And there ia

a

argument that prior to 1897 an alien could be sued any place,
and if Hohorst, as far as its holding, is still good law, thic
alien can be sued.
But it is cur position that Congress, whon it
pealed Hoi

;ha

-j

24
holdii

and thro ft wu* I;r;Iking also generally about venue.

But as

far as aliens bo lag subject to suit any place, that was

repaal-sd by -the *.ofc of 1897, and the Court considered it and
said«

fchvre waon't any intention to have any dovetailing.
So, to oo, this indicates that when the Court wrote

the St enite •opinion . it knew that there was a conflict in
certain ease?, namely patent cases, between general venue and
special venue,

with respect to all defendants» not just

domestic defendants»
Q

::£ the Court knew it at the time, there was no

occasion for the Court to pass on it, because that wasn91 the
fact before.
MR. KOXtISCKs
it.

Ho.

There was not an alien involved in

I say, it i.s significant in view of the sweeping language

which was us ad. in Sfconite, and then used again in Pourco, and
of course which is the language which gives the respondent here
the most trouble.

Because the Court did say this covers all

defendants, not just certain kinds of defendants, not blue-eyed
or gray-eyed defendants, it’s all defendants.

And of course

all defendants includes aliens as well as domestic.
So the Court had very definitely taken a very
strong position.
Kc-.;,

it could fee that — and there -are» I admit that

Chore arc a grcvp of defendants, a certain selected few, who

avay not gum liti and may mot be sued any place,

13: there is,

re's been some kind of' an oversight or a gap, as far
as the Sets cf Congress are concerned, because the 1897 Act
spoke very clearly*

If there has been a gap here , then

there’s going to be, or there will be some appropriate change
it the law, and that vrlil be for Congress,
Q

Has there been any bill to clarify that

situation that you know of?

Ml,, KOLXSCH:

No. There haven't been any bills, and

my submission is, of course, this is not a significant
problem, because the domestic patent owners are adequately
and well-protected; because of the fact that they can sue
anybody who uses or sells in this country, even if they can't
get the maker, plus the fact that they have all this protection
under the Tariff Act.
So that this is not a significant problem.

If it

becomes a significant problem, I'm certain that Congress will
take care of it.
Q

£o there are no proposals, up to now, that you

Well, what did it resolve?

MR. KOLISCHs

It simply codified the general venue

to aliens.

Thera hadn't been any statute with respect to them.

It had been recognised judicially that an alien could be
