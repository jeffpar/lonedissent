PROCE E D I N 6 S
MR e CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER s

We'll hear arguments next

in No. 55, Board of Regents against Hew Left Education Project.
Mr. ShuIt2, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. 0. SHULT2 II, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. SHULTSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courti
I am W. 0. Shultz, Assistant Attorney General from
the State of Texas, and represent the Board of Regents, in this
case, this morning.
«

Initially, since this Court postponed jurisdiction
until argument, I will address myself briefly to this jurisf

dictional question.

The only objection which appellee raises

in his brief to the jurisdiction of the Court concerns itself
with the fact that there is a coordinating board in the State of
Texas, and the appellant contends that is a higher authority
that has Statewide jurisdiction, and the Board c?f Regents is
somehow under it with regard to its rules and- regulations.
I submit to the Court that this is not so.

Th© Act

creating the coordinating board makes it precisely that, a
coordinating board.

Its primary purposes are to coordinate the

degree programs through the institutions in the State of Texas.
Our higher education setup, several of them colleges, have
their own board of regents.

The University of Texas, of course,

4
has a systemwide campus setup.

We have campuses in El Paso,

Arlington, Dallas, Odessa, Midland, Houston, Galveston, Port
Aransas, San Antonio.

These are all under the direction of the

Board of Regents,
The primary purpose of the coordinating board is to
coordinate degree programs in all the colleges.

And before a

college can institute a new degree program, they must get
approval of the coordinating board.

The Act creating th© Board

specifically says that it shall have only such powers as are
given to it in 'the Board — X mean in the Act, and any powers
which one of the governing boards of an institution of higher
education has that ar© not specifically delegated to the
coordinating board, the coordinating board does not have.
And there's no provision in the Coordinating Board
Act which gives them the authority to promulgate rules and
regulations which are applicable to any of the campuses with
regard to the day-to-day operation of those campuses.
New, at the last session of the Legislature, there
was a codification of the various education Acts ? they were
put into an education code.

And this Coordinating Board Act

was incorporated in the education code.
Now, at the same time, the same session of the
Legislature, there was an Act passed applying specifically to
the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System,

It's

Article 2585©, Vernon's Civil Statutes, and has just recently

5

been codified as such»
Section 1 of that Act reaffirms the power of the
Board of Regents to promulgate rules and regulations
applicable systemwidef and if I may quote briefly, it says:
The Board has authority "to promulgate and enforce such other
rules and regulations for the operation, control, and manage­
ment of the University of Texas System and the component
institutions thereof as the Board of Regents of the University
of Texas System may deem either necessary or desirable„n
Section 5 of that Act says, and I quote:

"This Act

is cumulative of all statutes relating to the University of
Texas System, or any of the component institutions of the
University of Texas System except where such statutes may be
in conflict with this Act*

If any such conflict arises, the

conflicting statute is hereby repealed to the extent of that

conflict. r“
So here we have, 1 think, ail doubt removed as to
any paramount authority in the Coordinating Board as to its
regulatory power, veto power over the rules and regulations of
the Board of Regents,
How, under Texas law, our Texas Supreme Court has
held that the regulations and rules of the Board of Regents of .
the University of Texas are equivalent of statutory enactments?
they are laws,
I think that since these regulations are systemwide,

s
and cover a substantial area of the State, they are —
Q

Are there any State-supported universities and

colleges to which these regulations do not apply?
MR. SHULTZ:

Yes, Your Honor, there are.

They are

not part of the University of Texas System, however,
Q

Well, let me put it another ways

Do these rules

and regulations apply to all units, all collages and univer­
sities within this particular system?
MR. SHULTZs

They apply to all schools and

institutions within the University of Texas System, Your Honor,
Q

Are those the ones in the communities you

mentioned, Galveston, et cetera?
MR. SHULTZ:
Q

Yes.

How many, in all?

MR. SHULTZ:

How many institutions?

Well, X think they — they say that they

have 1? component institutions in the system.
Q

/

And thay are all part of the University of ‘Texas

System?
MR. SHULTZ:

That's correct. Your Honor.

There's a

University of Texas at Austin, & University of Texas at El Paso

Q

Yes.

MR. SHULTZ?

— a University of Texas at Parmean

Basin, a University of Texas at Dallas, a University of Texas
at San Antoni©,

Then there's the University of Texas Med School

in Galveston, the Tumor Center and School in Houston, the

7
Southwest Med School in Dallas, Nursing School in Houston, the
Institute of Marin® Sciences in Port Aransas.
Q

And they are all the University of Texas, is

that it?
MR. SHULTZ:

That are all in the University of Texas

System.
Q

And these other State-supported colleges and

universities are — what?
MR, SHULTZ 5
boards of regents.

Are they —

Some of them have their own individual

We have a North Texas State University? it

has its own board of regents, by itself.

We have Texas Women's

University? it has its own board of regents, by itself.

They

have one campus only.
Q

What"s the relationship of these other State

universities — State-supported universities and colleges, to
the University of Texas System?
MR. SHULTZt

Non® other than that they all get

their money from the appropriations from the Texas Legislature.
They ar® —
Q

There's no common board of education for all of

them?
MR, SHULTZ t

Not as far as regulating the hiring and

firing, the day-to-day operation of the school, the rules and
regulations —
Q

But there is, for that purpose —

8
MR. SHULTZ s
Q

Is there an over-all agency?

MR. SHULTZ;
Q

Pardon?

To do — that has this power?

That supervises — that has something to do with

every State-supported college and university?
MR. SHULTZs

The Coordinating Board has,, to the extent

it has power, to try to coordinate the degree programs.

It was

primarily established to — we had rather a hodgepodge in our
higher education system, frankly

to try and keep duplication

of degree programs and efforts at the various schools to a
minim©, by requiring approval for institution of new degree
programs or the establishment of a new college or school
within the particular university.
They sit there, the supreme power, and say, Well now,
this school already has a pretty good program in that field,
now, do we need one at this school?
i

Q

How about Texas ASM?

MR. SHULTZ:
Marshall.

That's a matter of dispute, Mr. Justice

Our Constitution said that Texas ASM is a branch

of the University of Texas.

But it has operated under its

own Board of Regents for many, many years.

The only common

thing they share is that Texas ASM University gets a part of the
permanent endowment fund that was set aside to the University
of Taxas under the Constitution of 1876.
Q

Well, isn't Texas ASM separate and distinct from

9
the University of Texas as of today?
MR. SHULTZ:

It is as far as its operation is con­

cerned* Your Honor.
Q

And yet it is not covered by this order?

MR. SHULTZ:

That's true.

This is not a part of the

University of Texas System.
Q

Well, then, how can it be a Statewide order?

MR. SHULTZ:

It applies to every institution under

the control of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas
System.
Q

The Board of Regents does not control all of

the institutions of higher learning maintained by the State of
Texas„
MR. SHULTZ;

Wo, Your Honor, we've never made that

contention.
Q

Well, don't you have to to get a three-judge

court?
MR. SHULTS:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

Once the

rule or regulation itself is applicable to all the institutions
under this Board's control, and those boards are Statewide —
Q

Well, suppose it controlled two schools.

Would

it be a three-judge court matter?
MR. SHULTS;
Q

I think it would.

It's not --

Well, suppose it controlled two of the 300

schools maintained by the State of Texas, would you say that

10
was Statewide?
MR. SHULTZ:
Q

Possibly not.

But that is not the case *

Well, where’s your line?

MR. SHULTZ:

Well, I don't think we're called upon

to draw the line in this case because we have gone so far on
the other side of the line I think it's unquestionedi whether
we would draw it at 5, 6, 7, or 8, I don’t know.

But hare

we’ve» got a board with control over 17 institutions.

And at

the University of Texas at Austin alone, there are 40,000
students, and over 7,000 employees on a 265-acre campus.
Whan you include all the other campuses and
institutions, I’m hard put to say how many people are involved?
but many, many thousands.

And they are placed under these

regulations, and they have the undoubted force and effect of
a statute according fco the pronouncement of the Texas Suprema
Court.
That is our basis for the jurisdiction of this Court,
on a direct appeal from a three-judge Federal Court.
How, if I may address myself to how this case came
about:

It was bora out of an effort of the Board of Regents to

enforce this solicitation rule on the campus^

at the University

of Texas at Austin, against a group known as the Hew Left
Education Group and a number of individuals that were selling
on the campus a newspaper known as "The Rag", not in conformity
with the rules applicable to the sale of newspapers.

11
Now, the Regents, after local administration at the
campus, after repeated efforts in warning these people to stop,
asked the Attorney General8s Office to institute a civil
injunction proceeding in the State District Court in Travis
County, to enforce their rules.
We filed this injunction suit, and shortly thereafter
the self-same defendants in the State court action went to the
United States District Court and filed an action there, asking
•that the rules be declared unconstitutional, that the Regents
be enjoined from enforcing them, and that the prosecution of
this civil injunctive suit in the State court be enjoined.
We pointed out to the court, by pleading, that 2233
in our estimation, the anti-injunction statute, prohibited this
very action in the United States District Court.
Immediately thereafter, the pleadings of the plaintifi
in tii© United States District Court were amended to bring in
Young Democrats and seven or eight individuals.
>

;

Now, reading that pleading as a whole, and the motion,
I think it's undoubted they all claimed to be members of a
common class of people who claim that theip constitutional
rights are being infringed by the enforcement of this rule.
Now, the group of individuals, I don31 think ever
presented a case or controversy for the court to act upon.
They merely said in the pleading that: We are interested in the
free flow and dissemination of information on th© campus of the

university,
There was never any evidence introduced,, or any
stipulation or any affidavit filed by them that showed in any
manner how these rules had been enforced against them# or how
they had prohibited them from obtaining any specific article#
printed matter# or hearing any speech that they desired to hear.
There simply was no factual basis in the complaint.

There was

never any adduced to show that they presented any justification
for controversy with regard to these rules.
So# consequently# they stand largely ignored throughout
this entire proceeding.
Shortly after the Young Democrats intervened ~» beg
your pardon# they didn't intervene? they cam© ih by way of the
First Amended Complaint.

They asked for the same relief that

the original party plaintiffs asked for# with the exception
they didn't ask that the State court proceeding be enjoined.;
I
Shortly after this, by a Motion to Intervene# a gtoup
known as the Young Socialist Alliance were allowed into the
case.

They adopted the prior pleadings as their own.
Now# it’s our position that all of these parties# at

this point in tha proceeding# plead themselves to be members
of a common class of people on the university campus at Austin#
who desired to solicit in violation of the Regents' solicita­
tion rules# and that their rights under the First Amendment
were being infringed# and asked for the same relief# every one

13
of them, that the rule be del cared invalid and it be enjoined.
The next event that occurred was a hearing before the
United States District Court, three-judge panel, at which the
arguments were made concerning 2283.

And that court then

entered what I considered to be a rather strange order.

It

divided this class of plaintiffs in the United Statas District
Court, into two groups, and denominated them as Class A and
Class B.

And never did say that they had distinct and

individual claims or causes of action, that their actions were
different.

It just divided them into two groups within the

class, Class A and Class B.
And it said;

Class A, you.11 re the people that are

defendants over in the State court action; now, we're going to
dismiss you to go back over to the State court.
to dismiss you almost; they said?

We9re going

we're going to retain

jurisdiction in the event they do something to you over there
in the State court that can't be condoned, then you can come
back here and ask for relief; we'll retain jurisdiction to that

extent,
So, with things in that posture, we proceeded to the
State court and obtained a temporary, after a full hearing,
and the record reveals -that in tha State court the parties
defendant and -tha parties plaintiff in tha Federal Court
plead and raised the same constitutional objections that they
were pleading in the Federal Court, if you please;

violated

14
First Amendment rights, protection under the Fourteenth
Amendment,
These were argued to the State District Court, after
a full hearing on temporary injunction, witnesses testified?
counsel for all parties in the Federal and State court proceeding
were the sasse,

The State District Court then entered a

temporary injunction, specifically finding that the rules were
constitutional, and temporarily enjoining the defendants and
all others acting in concert with them from soliciting by means
of the newspaper known a® “The Rag58 on the University of Texas
campus at Austin, other than in conformity with the solicitation
rule»
V

We next —
Q

Mr. Shults, is the Mow Left before us here?

The Mew Left Group?
MR. SHULTZ;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

In what way?

They were the ones that were

dismissed out with the little tag end that you mentioned.
MR. SHULTZ s

The Mew Left, together with a group of

individuals who were members of the Maw Left organisation —
there were soma individuals, six or eight individuals —
'• . -r-

Q

They .¥©!?© all dismissed out.

had how are they

/

here, then?
MR. SHULTS %

Well, Your Honor, we claim that they

are here by virtual representation of the rest of their class

15
that they left over in the Federal Court»
Q

Only as a member of a class now?

They’ve taken

no cross-appeal?
MR» SHULTZs
Q

Your Honor.

Maybe I should ask your opposing counsel as to

their presence here.
MR. SHULTZ;

All right.

But they're — our contentions with regard to the
relation between these two segments of the class are essentially
— it's essential to xefex to them in this case, and it's
essential to our contention that we keep reference to them here
because our contention is, first, that -the State court
judgment, the temporary injunction, was res judicata as to the
remainder of the class that stayed in Federal Court.
They ware admittedly part of the same class.

We got

a temporary injunction in the Federal —* in the State court,
which held fch© provision's constitutional.

Wow —
Q

Mow, your opponent draws a distinction between

a temporary injuction and a permanent one, for res judicata
purposes.

Would you comment on that?
MR. SHULTZ:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackman,

Under Tessas law and under the federal law, even on
a temporary injunction hearing, if issues which go to the
very heart of the merits of the case are decided on that

16
temporary injunction, than that judgment is final as to those
purposes.
Nov;, I'm sure that it must be obvious to everyone
concerned in the matter that on a — if we go back to the State
court and have a hearing on a permanent injunction or to make
this temporary injunction permanent, the court is certainly
not going to reconsider and pass on the constitutionality under
the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment again.
already done that.

He's

He said these rules are constitutional.

it couldn't be any more final on the question of
constitutionality, whether it be temporary or not.
We feel that under

England vs. Louisiana Medical

Examiners, where the group went to the State court, didn't
reserve their federal question, came back to the Federal Court
and they said "you're precluded".
It's our contention that under the Atlantic Coast
Line Railway v. Engineers case, 22.83 is a specific bar, because
!

here the Regents are enjoined from enforcing this rule,,

Could

we go back to the State court now and ask them to hold these
people in contempt?

I'd be leery of doing it, because I think

we'd be right back in Federal District Court, being held in
contempt ourselves.
We've got a direct conflict between the jurisdiction
of the two courts, the decision of the two courts in complete
conflict.

Now,they had an adequate remedy:

appealing that

17
decision of the State court.

It was entered before the Federal

Court ever undertook to decide the issue.
It’s our contention that the Federal Court should
have left the matter alone* to bo proceeded through the State
court and eventually up here.

As it is * the District Court

there sat in a review of what the State court diet, so to speak.
Q

Is the temporary injunction on the State side

appealable?
MR. SHULTZ2
0

Yes* Your Honor

,

it is.

That was never appealed and is “~

MR. SHULTZ ;

Still in effect.

Under our procedure*

though* there is a way to go in and make a motion to set it
aside* or open it and modify it.

Q

So there’s no — in efifect* there’s no time

limitation —
MR. SHULTZ;

No, as far as their remedy to it? they

may have it ~~ try to have it set aside.

In other words* it

hasn’t become irrevocably final in that respect.
Q

And they can move to have it set aside* and if

that’s denied* then they can appeal that denial?
MR. SHULTZ; That's correct.
Q

Yes.

MR. SHULTZ;
Q
understand it

That’s the way it works.

But no such efforts have been made?

As I

IB
MR. SHULTZ:

Mo.

No.

They never have.

They merely-

proceeded over to tha Federal Court and moved for summary
judgment,, and on our cross motion to dismiss, the court entered
summary judgment in their favor and denied our motion to
dismiss? overruled all these contentions we made about the —
Q

Yes.

Well, the court didn’t really issue a

summary judgment in their favor.

That is, the defendants in

wTha Rag” case, as you've already told us.
MR. SHULTZ:
Q

That the A group

MR. SHULTZ?
Q

No, but in the —

It's our contention —

— and the B group —

MR. SHULTZ:

But it’s our contention that they are

part and parcel of the same group.
Q

Well, I don’t understand what you're —

MR. SI-IULTZ: The A group made the same contentions „
They returned in the guise of the B group, with the same
counsel, and argued the same questions.
Q

The court said that it dismissed the New Left

Education Project plaintiffs? dismissed them as plaintiffs.
MR. SHULTZ:,
Q

Yes —

So that there would be no interference with the

State judge's adjudication.
MR. SHULTZ:
Q

If Your Honor will —

I'm reading from page 165 of the Appendix, which

19
is the — from, I think, the final memorandum opinion of the
three-judge court»
MR, SHULT^s

Right, Your Honor» But if you will look

at the order entered, which is — begins on page 41 —on page
42.
Q

Yes.

MR. SHULTZs

"The court finds that it should not

at this time exercise its jurisdiction as to that part of Part
A that requests injunctive relief against the proceedings
pending in the 16?th Judicial District Court of Travis County,

Texas, bocau.se the extraordinary circumstances required by
Machesky ... for this type of relief are not presented at this
time.

Similarly, the court concludes that the prayer of these

plaintiffs for declaratory relief, considered separately ...
should be denied at this time in the exercise of the court5s
discretion.K
Dropping on down, it says, ‘’Accordingly, those
portions of those plaintiffs? complaint requesting declaratory
relief &nd injunctive relief against the state proceeding are
dismissed, so that there will be no interference ... This
court, however, retains jurisdiction over that part of the
case which requests further appropriate relief against the
defendant should such relief become necessary.

Moreover, the

dismissal ... is done without prejudice to their right to
return again under Machesky .».!I

20
Q

That's sort of —

MR. SHULTZ s
Q

So it's kind of "ws did and we didn't»"

— double-talk, isn't it?

MR. SHULTZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

"We did and we

didn't."
Q

They dismiss, but then they says

No, no, we

don't dismiss.
MR. SHULTZ:

"We dismiss for one purpose but not

for the other."
Now, if 1 may address myself briefly to the merits of
this ease, it will —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have just about four

and a half minutes left.
MR. SHULTZ:

All right, sir.

There’s no showing in this case that there has been
an arbitrary assignment of places or. the campus at the
University of Tessas at Austin for the distribution and sale of
newspapers from vending machines.

The stipulation shows that

there are 12 newspapers currently selling from these
designated places, from vending machines, without any problems.
These people haven't shown that unless .they can go
around over the campus, free at will, that they're going to go
out of business.

They haven’t shown any irreparable injury.

As a matter of fact they for a while sold at one of these
locations, out of vending machines.

21
This is a highly congested campus.

There's evidence

in the record that students, one student who made her
affidavit said that she had been accosted by these people on
the campus, they bothered her in the free use of the campus.
There's evidence that solicitations in the laboratory buildings
and classrooms had disrupted classes.

The same thing occurred

in the dormitories on previous occasions.
Now, with this background, the Regents certainly had
the authority to authorise the administration to designate
where the administration felt that these things could be sold
from vending machines without interfering with the operation of
the university.
Now, this Court has recognised, in Addarly and Cox,
that where a public property is dedicated to a special moe
that rules and regulations can be maintained, even though they
infringe upon First Amendment rights in order to maintain that
property for that use.
And that's all it's done here.

There has been no

showing whatsoever of any disadvantage by virtu© of the place
designated.
Q

Mr. ShultK, do you undorstand that the appellees

contend for the right to solicit only in the free-speech areas
of the Austin campus, or beyond that?
MR. SHULTZs

Your Honor, there's only one free™speech

area of the Austin campus, and that’s a patio out by the Union

22

Building that’s designated as such.

They maintain that the

malls of the university are frse-speech areas? but our
affidavits shcxv that they have never been maintained as freespeech areas on -tine campus.

There are no speakers, stump

speakers there.
Q

Well, iirhat is it you feel they’re asking for,

to go everywhere and beyond the froeyspeech area?
MR. SHULTZs

Anywhere they want to go, that’s what

theyfve been doing, roaming free at will over the campus.
Along with other people.

Since this case has been decided,

we’ve had all sorts of people out there selling their
newspapers and their pamphlets, and running —
Q

Is that all that’s involved here?

Whether or

not the university or the Regents may specify the places where
these papers zaay be sold?
MR. SHULTZ:

Prom a vending machine.

Just as tills

Q

I mean, is that all that's involved?

the impression that one of these also had something to do with

Solicitation of dues.

MR. SHULTZ §

Dues, for campus organisations.

Q

Yes, that’s it,

Q

They can’t do that through a vending machine.

23
can they, very well?
MR. SHULTZi

No, sir; but there's another regulation

that says they may do it at registration or they may do it at
their meetings on the campus; but they can't just set up booths
and start -- we have over 400 registered student organisations
on that campus.

And if all of them started soliciting their

dues and membership up and down the halls, freely at will —

Yes.

and all that.

They restrict those activities under a

They can keep it there, and it's

a different rule entirely.
Q

You moan in a heated campus election you can't

talk to anybody in the classroom or the dormitory?
MR. SHULTZ?

Well, Your Honor, I don't think that

they can talk to them in the classroom, take over the

25

classroom and start making a lengthy speech.
Q

I didn't say take ever tha class, I said in the

classrooms, in the hallways.
MR, SHULTZ:

In the hallways —

If it is, it's —

MR. SHULTZs

In tha hallways, I'm sure they can, Your

Honor,

And the dormitories and all the other places

that these people want to go?
MR. SHULTZ5

Mo, I'm not sure that it's that free.

But that question isn't involved here, and that rule —
Q

Well, it's a different campus from any I've ever

heard of, because when they get a hot election, that’s all
anybody talks about.
MR. SHULTZ t We have a vary small percentage of people
that even vote in our elections on that campus.

They're not

In Texas?!

MR. SHULTZs

That’s correct.

My time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr, Richards.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID R. RICHARDS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR, RICHARDSs

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
This case presents a series of initial procedural and

26
jurisdictional questions.

If they are ever answered suitably,

then the case presents a rather clear First toendment question
regarding the extent to which a State university may restrict
the legitimate First Amendment activities of student political
organisations on campus.
Q

Do you agree with your friend that they can

restrict some First Amendment rights?
MR. RICHARDS s

I agree that a balance may be struck

and that clearly the rights are not absolute and that the right
to maintain the institution end to operate it still may — or
at least may even be paramount, if not, certainly it must be
given sway.
We say —
Q

Well, what, specifically, are we concerned with?

MR. RICHARDS *

Specifically, we're concerned hare,

as w© understood the First Amendment issue.

W® have two

organisations that are her© beforo the Courts

the Young f

Democrats and Young Socialists, registered student organize"
tions and long-time participants on the campus,

They have

sought the right to solicit membership dues in the same areas
of the campus, to wit, the malls, in which
Q

That is not solicit membership?

MR. RICHARDSs
excuse me.

Membership and membership dues,

Membership and membership dues.

Because I say

this advisedly, because the nature of the regulation is such

27
that they are new permitted, under the regulation, to establish
a booth.

They may maintain a booth on the mall.

distribute literature.

They

But, they say, the organisation may

not, at the same time, sse.y to that persons

"Join our

organisation? here's a membership card? pay us two bucks".
They say that's commercial, falls under the commercial regula­
tions .
So, really all they're saying is that we want to
carry out the full rang© of our activities, which are
legitimate, that is solicit membership dues, in the same
locations whore we’re permitted to carry out other kinds.
They can set up a booth, set up — circulate a petition —
Q

In other words, are these two organisations

satisfied, Ho, 1, to limit the places to where the regulation
says it ©ay have booths, and No, 2, to solicit both membership
anti the payment of membership fees at that place?
MR. RICHARDS:

This has been the position from th®

outset, as I understood what we’ve argued,

Essentially we’re

looking — well, let me, I shouldn’t — we also argued for th®
right to «sell political literature from that a am®, booth.
f

Q

But you don't ask to roam -~

MR. RICHARDS: We have never asked the right to roam
th.® campus, and never suggested -that that was necessary.
Th® malls are wide and open, there’s movement there all th®
time.

There are other activities of a comparable neture, and

28
all we wanted to do was to flush out
at least soliciting dues»

It’s the only logical place to do

so, frankly * the only place we see- the students to whom we
appeal,

Q

Let ra© see if I've got this clear in my mind.

MR. RICHARDSj
Q

Yes, sir,

Are you content if your booth is set up and

you have some of your people behind the counter in the booth
who can receive and solicit — receive dues from people who
want to come there to pay it* and solicit people who are walking
by?

Or does your claim go that they may send their people

outsido of the booth and go all up and down the mall?
MR. RICKARDSs
been the former.

It has never — our contention has

That is, that we sought to do* to perform

these activities in the same areas, from the same type booth
we’re now functioning from, for other purposes.
other organizations.

We are, and

We’ve never sought the right to stroll

about the campus sailing -•* sailing literature or hawking or
soliciting dues? naver sought the right to solicit them within
dormitories or within the physical facilities of the campus.
It’s been a very limited and, as I understand the
nature of the court’s order below, that the nature of which —
Q

Well, but what happens on the mall where, I

gather, all these booths are located?
within the booth* or do they

Would your folks stay

29

MR. RICHARDS?

Really it's a misnomer, actually,

because no one has had that much money.

All they have is

card tables, and they set them up, and they sit behind the card
tables.
Q

And people come to the card tables?

MR, RICHARDSs Sure.
Q

That's what they do now.

And' it isn't that representatives go up and down

and buttonhole students walking across the mall?
MR. RICHARDS? Well, I guess X shouldn't hold myself
out as an expert on what really transpires.

We described our

relief narrowly in terms I am new indicating to you.

That is,

we wanted to be able to do the same kind of activities that
other organisations ware doing in those same areas, and we
didn’t want to have our activities limited by simply the label
that it’s commercial.
That's all.

And so we've really sought, parity.

With respect to the kinds of activities that

other student organisations are doing under the guise of
/

being

for which they have approval.
Mow*, the record reflects the young people selling

balloons from a booth on the campus.

We assume that our conduct

in a similar location would be no more disruptive in the similar
areas, and that we ought to be permitted to do so.
Q

That's all,

How long is that permit good for?

MR. RICHARDSg Wall, actually, the record reflects,
and this is a narrow period of time, and this is the rule that

30
permission is sought for a specific time or times.

The

responses to the interrogatories I think will reflect in the
record the kind of permission that’s sought.

Some people

seek *— my clients have — for a week to maintain a booth on
the mall for such-and-such purpose, and have done so.
They etill seek permission, and we haven't even
quarreled with that to this extent.

We've conceded that there

are legitimate concerns for congestion, that the university
may wall say. We can’t tolorate more than IS or 20 booths on
this area, it’s got to bo first-eome-first-served, and that
there's going to fo® a limit in tenus of time.

We’ve conceded

that to the court below, and X think the court below conceded
that in its opinion.
The stipulation is that there are frequently as many
as 15 booths erected along the West Mall, as it’s called, ef
the university campus, soliciting — distributing literature,
and matters of this kind.
:

We’ve simply sought to — as X say,

!.: V*

/

simply sought parity here.
And 1 think that’s all the court below did.

X think

their opinion fairly gives the Regents and th© responsible
university administrator» full authority to maintain their
institution, and —
Q

Mr. Richards.

MR. RICHARDS %
Yes, sir?

— do it according to their contract.

31
Q

I wag Interested in your response,

You

carefully referred to the Young Democrats and the Yeung
Socialists, but made no reference whatever to the Mew Left,
1*11 ask you what I asked your friend:

Is the New Left

before us?
MR, RICHARDSs
Q

Mot in my judgment they're not,

Then you are not representing the New Left at

this juncture?
MR. RICHARDS:

I am not representing the New Left

at this juncture,
Q

Even though your brief states you are the

attorney for the appellees, and they are named as an appellee?
MR. RICHARDSs

Well, X guess we're caught up in sort

of a — I didn't print the brief, but — I didn't print the
style of the record? the record still carries them, and X
assume that's a matter of nomenclature and so forth in the
clerk's office.

The case was never restyled below when the

Mew Left was dismissed.

But that was simply a matter of

policy in the clerk's office.
Excuse me?
Q

I'm sorry, Mr. Richards, to keep questioning

you, but -MR, RICHARDS: That's quite all right.
Q
is

«— X just don't have a clear pictura of what it

goes on.

32
ME. RICHARDSj All right.
Q

Had your clients;, the Socialists and the Democrats

applied for a permit at a booth "merely to distribute
political literature", would that have been granted?
MR. RICHARDSt

Yes, sir.

It has been granted and

granted commonly, as the record so reflects.
Q

Well, whafc you added to it was, not only did you

want at that place to distribute political literature but
also to be allowed to solicit membership and solicit the
payment of membership fees? is that it?
MR. RICHARDSs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And those are the two things that ware denied?

MR. RICHARDS?
Let me add that.

The sale also of political literature.

That the Young Democrats had bumper stickers

that, on one occasion, they wanted to sell from that same
booth.

Political bumper stickers.
The Young Socialists —•
Q

They’d give, them away if they could, is that

right?
MR. RICHARDS?
away.

That’s right.

W® could give them

In fact, they did give them away when they were —

found that they could not sell them.

But, of course, the

financing of political parties being such as it is, they need
to exact a price if they can.
Q

So, really, what it comes down to, then, what

33
you're suggesting is that all we have before us is a regulation
which denies these organizations the right to .solicit member­
ship and to solicit fees, and to sell that political literature?
MR. RICHARDS t
Q

That6s right,, Your Honor.

Is that all?

MR, RICHARDSs

That’s all, as I understand it.

Let me say that the regulation is couched in the guise
of a prohibition against commercial solicitation, and the
Regents, by their application of it, have swept up this kind
of political activity in the embargo against commercial
solicitation.

Q

Well, you don't deny, in a sense, it’s

commercial **~
MR. RICHARDSs

Q

It has commercial aspects,

-« in aspect, but you say it's political

expression and for that reason it’s protected by the First
Amendment?
MR. RICHARDS«

That's our contention, yes, Your

Honor»
The Appendix, at 13? through 141, has some indication
of the kinds of literature and the organisations that are
engaged in distribution of literature in these very areas
all throughout the year.
Let me -■*» inasmuch as we have maintained throughout
that this matter was not on© that required the convening of a

34
three-judge court, we realize of course that it’s not our
position to have to carry that burden.

It's bean our view

from the outset# we opposed the convening of the three-judge
court# and w© still assume that this matter could have been
disposed of amply by £ single judge sitting in Travis County,
We do not consider that the regulations have the
general and Statewide application that this Court spoke of in
Moody vsm Flowers# and hence, as our brief points out, I
think the Texas statutes to which we refer will demonstrate ,
there are soma 40 or 50 or 60 various institutions of higher J
learning in Texasj and, a© Mr. Shults concedes, these rules
w© talk about apply to only a portion of those, albeit th©
University of Texas is th© most substantial.
Q

Well, are all th® others fully supported by the

State, to the extent that the University of Texas is?
ME. RICHARDS %

Yes, Your Honor,

1 think — as I say,

we refer to Article 2919© of the Texas civil statutes lists:
what I consider to be, or at least at that point, all the
State-supported institutions of higher education, both junior
college and senior college.

And 1 think reference to that,

I think, would put in perspective the -Q

And there are how many, roughly?

MR. RICHARDSs

I think I said 40-odd in my brief.

I haven't had a chance to count them.
Q

All right

35
MR. RICHARDSs But It'S —
Q

And I think we ware told that there are 17

units in the University of Texas,
MR. RICHARDS;

Soma of which are yet to be open,

but, nevertheless, they will be open soon.
Q

I'm a little confused on one thing, now, Mr.

Richards, maybe you can clear it up,
MR. RICHARDS ;
Q

I'll try, sir.

Are you now permitted, or have you been

permitted in the past, to sell political pamphlets and papers
and documents?
MR. RICKARDS;
Q

On campus?

On these — at these booths, or tables as you

call them?
MR. RICHARDS;

No, Your Honor.

That has not been

permitted in the past.
Q

You can only give them away?

MR. RICHARDS; Give them away.
Q

And that's under —

MR. RICHARDSs There's been no restriction on giving
them away, except — but they have not bean permitted to ba
sold,
Q

Is anyone permitted to sell anything other than

balloons along there?
MR. RICHARDS:

Wall, university"sanctioned publica-

36

fcione are sold along there, as the stipulation in the record
reflects®

These are purely university-sanctioned —
G

You mean school papers and things like that?

MR. RICHARDS:

Wall, school papers or magazines.

The — well, the Student Association is authorised to sell
insurance to the students, which of course, again it's
university related? but it certainly has a very substantial
commercial aspect.
Thor© are regular activities on the campus of the
kind, like motion pictures that the public can come to and pay
to sea, entertainments of various sorts.

The campus is, as

Mr. Shultz indicates, a rather substantial size and number,
it now houses the Lyndon Johnson Library, which has become
one of the major tourist attractions in our part of the world,
and it's a place that embraces all manner of activities of
very much to a commercial aspect, both directly related to the
university and the spinoffs that ars common.
Q

Thank you.

Q

Mr. Richards, looking at the judgment on page-

176 of the record, I understand your position now, your only
/
real complaint is that you can have the booths and do certain
things, but they wouldn't let you do these other things.
doesn't this judgment declare these rules and regulations
invalid on their face?
MR. RICHARDS *

It declares them invalid, but the

But

37
text of the opinion snakes clear, as I understand it, that the
— well, ifc does declare them invalid, yes.

And enjoins their

enforcement as to these two plaintiffs, the Young Democrats
and Young Socialists.
Q
entitled to?

Isn't that rather more relief than you were
I mean, is the university now without any

regulations at this school at all?
MR, RICHARDS:

Under the judgment..

They — unless they have supplanted

them, they are without regulations at this school.
Q

Was that required to give you the relief you

wanted?
MR. RICHARDS:

I think it was not essential to give tl

relief 1 asked? that's correct, Your Honor.
Th© judgment runs only as to the plaintiffs, who are
the Young Democrats and the Young -Socialists «—
Q

Yes, I notice that —

MR. RICHARDS:
large.

it does not run to the world at

And the injunction -- if yon read — the judgment

appears at 176 arid 177.
Q

Yes, that's what I'm looking at,

MR. RICKARDS %

And in paragraph 2, "the Court

declares that the activities engaged in by the plaintiffs”,
and this is, by -reference, the Young Democrats and the Young
Socialists —- "in solicitation of membership ... and ... sal© oi
literature constitutes speech and associations! activities...”

36
Q

Yes, but look at paragraph 3■*

It sayss

All the defendant's agents# et cetera# are enjoined from
further enforcement against the plaintiffs of the rules and
regulations.

Do you think that's as far as it goes?

ME. RICHARDS?

Well# I suppos® it's a matter of

construction in the trial court's judgment# and I think there
may be a certain inconsistency there.

At least I confess I

had thought of it as running over to the plaintiffs# and
running tho kinds of activities I have indicated? but you're
quite — I guess it could b© construed by another trial court
in — ar4d a more clear judgment could ba construed more broadly
by them.

Q

Well# what do you say to Mr. Shulta's problem

about# they might violate the federal rule and you might violate
•tiie. State order# and who violatos what?
ME. RICHARDSt Well# let ras —» i'll com® to that and
try to apeak to it# because Z don't want to be caught off in
the notion that we all are here together # that the people

I may preface my remarks by saying that I don't
want

Mr. ShuIts has alluded from time to time t© the fact

that everybody has all been represented by the earn© counsel.
But the explanation of that# I think# is sufficient to say that
that's true of most civil liberties eases in that part of Texas#

39
and I don't think yon can make judgments about *— or that that
really makes weight in terms of who's here»

But ’The Rag"

plaintiffs, as they were called, were severed and sent back
to the State Court and remained there»
return to the State
Q

They never sought to

to the Federal Court.

But this was their lawsuit.

MR. RICHARDS; They initiated the lawsuit, and until
they were dismissed from it, it was their lawsuit.
Q

Well, then, as we've already seen, there's some

\

question about whether or not they ware dismissed from it.
MR. RICHARDSs Well, let's — I take it that the
court's order that appears is explicit that they consider them
dismissed, that they could go back ~~ the State court was in
fact told it was free to proceed against them? with the
reservation that Mr. Shults refers to, l5m not certain.
I assumo that that's the kind of reservation that was
contemplated, perhaps, with the notion that if they didn't
i

raise federal constitutional issues in the State court that
they might later coma back.

I think it could be construed in

that fashion.
But the sequence of events, I think, is material here,
Mr. Shults has compressed, I think, -the time factor.
The suit was filed, that's correct, by what was
called the Mew Left Education Project, in the Federal Court.
Thereafter, as the record reflects, the Regents

40
changed their rvJ.es

again

and caught up the Young Democrats

in the rules and s aid * for the first time* that they could not
solicit membership dues at registration time? which has been
a traditional right of theirs,
At that point the Young Democrats filed* refiled
again* wo filed a motion to amend to join them.

The Regents

opposed* urging* among other things* that there should be
severance.

This was all argued at one time.

The court issued

its order supporting the Regent© with respect to the threejudge court* severing out the initial plaintiffs* the New Left
plaintiffs* and sending them back to the Stato court and saying
that they would retain the action as to the Young Democrats for
further proceedings„
Thro© months later the Young Socialist group filed, a
motion to intervene, and were permitted intervention finally*
and it was in that posture that the case cam© on for final
decision,
The arguments with respect to class * with respect to
res judicata* are murky* but* at best* the Texas class action
rule is the old Federal rule? that is* it was spirited from the
Federal rules* the motion was of a spurious class* and it was
not binding as a matter of res judicata* unlike the new
Federal rule.
Although a grant of a temporary injunction is
appealable* it's only reversible on a clear abuse of discretion*

41
that's governing Texas standards? so I do:a,?t thin?; there’s
finality in the Texas State Court judgment that would sustain
res judicata.
And, finally, these parties, albeit having similar
interests, were never in the State court.

They were told, in

fact, by the Federal Court that they were fro® to remain there
and litigate their issues? and this they did.
E3ow, 1 think, but for the birth of the case and
perhaps that’s — I take full responsibility for that.

£ guess

it's just a matter of judicial economy, or economy in the office
or something.

We didn’t file a separate suit on behalf of the

Young- Democrats*

The case was already, at that stage, going

to be considered by three judges on several issues, and so,
rather than do another one and have another three-judge court
appointed, we did it this way.
But I think dll that really says is that we had, at
one point, two parties who sort of crossed in the night on
this litigation and really had nothing to do with each other,
sine© then.
Q

What about Mr. Shultz’s questions

What does ha

do with the parties that he has in the State court'?
MR. RICHARDS:

I

«— the Federal Court has said —

excuse xao, I don’t mean — I didn’t mean not to respond to it,
Your Honor.

Tim Federal Court has said that he was free to

proceed against them, and I assume that he has bean free to do s-

42
Contentions have been made with respect to their
activities, which are entirely different, frankly, from that
of the Young Democrats and the Young Socialists? contentions
are being made of harassment, of verbal abuse, this kind of
thing, all of which might have sustained injunctive relief as
to that kind of conduct.

But none of that was present with

respect to my clients who are here before this Court, the Young
Democrats and the Young Socialists.
No suggestion that they've engaged in anything more
than just a simple organisational, First Amendment conduct.
Q

Your suggestion is that analytically this thing

will simplify itself if we look at this as two separate law­
suits, and forget all about those A plaintiffs? is that it?
MR. RICHARDS?
•!

I think it would certainly bs —

The A plaintiffs brought this lawsuit to enjoin

— and to sell newspapers.

MR. RICHARDS8 Right,
Q

And your present clients

MR. RICHARDS % Don’t have anything to do with —
Q

* are not involved in the State action and

don’t want to sell newspapers.

43
MR* RICHARDS:
Q

That true? don't want to sell —

They are two separate lawsuits, then,

MR, RICHARDS:

Well, that's the way I have always

viewed it, esscepfc it’s been caught up, as I say, in sort of
giving numbers and names to it to make it appear all on©? but
it certainly ia different.
Q

1 see Mr, Shults ia a little concerned —

MR. RICHARDSt Well, I think the answer to that is
and 2 was going to come back to it? I don’t want to be unfair.
Actually the Young Socialists do have a paper they'd like to
sell, called the "Militant”,

So I don't mean to say that

embraced within their activity was not the sale of a political
newspaper or any — Mr. Shults is quite right about that.
I think the first — I’ve tried to state that the
First Amendment issues, I think, in opening argument — 2
would add only this, that we are now dealing with the 26th
Amendment's enactment, but the student body, to all extents and,
purposes, as I loosed at the figures, only on© percent now of
the student body is under 18 years of age, and we’re,not
dealing with — we’re dealing with citizens whom we have now
accorded the full right to vote.’

We're dealing with them

in the area in which their interests are normally debated.
It would be, it seems to me, consistent with that
First Amendment, or the freedom of their voting right, that at
least political issues, the activities of traditional political

44
organisations be permitted to flourish in & ncn~dj.srupt.ive
manner on the university campus in the one place that these
young people can be reached,,
If there are no further questions, thank you»
