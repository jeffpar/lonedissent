MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments next in Ho. 70-5015, Argersimger against Hamlin.
Mr. Rogow, you may proceed whenever you are
ready,,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S. ROGOW, ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROGOW:

Mr. Chief Justice ana may it please

the Court:
Certiorari was granted in this case to review
the decision of the Florida Supreme Court which held four
to three that the right to counsel extends only to those
cases which carry a maximum punishment in excess of six
months»
The petitioner in this case, Jon Richard
Argersinger, was convicted in Leon County Court, Tallahassee
Florida, on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon.

The

maximum punishment disposable on that charge was six month»
in prison or a fine of $1000.

Because the maximum

punishment was only six months„ the Florida Supreme Court
held that Argersinger was not entitled to have been advised
of his right to counsel.
Three dissenters- in the Florida Supreme Court
would have held that the right to counsel extends to any
offense in which a man may lose his liberty.

Our position

4
is essentially to.-it*

Our position is that wherever the

actual threat of incarceration exists, a man must be
advised of his right to counsel and counsel must be
appointed for him if he cannot afford counsel, unless the
defendant knowingly and intelligently waives that right.
Q

Suppose the judge at the outset under the

rule such as you suggest concluded in his own mind that he
was not going to impose any sentence, even though it was
permitted and then went ahead with the trial?

That would

be all right under your theory, would it?
MR. ROGOW:

If he went ahead with the trial and

did not impose incarceration—
Q

Imposed only a fine.

MR. ROGOW:
Q

Yes, sir.

Wow, then, if he imposed at the conclusion of

the trial—he concluded that he changed his mind, that
either the offense was much more serious than he had first
thought or perhaps a probation report or some information
about a prior record came to his notice and he concluded to
impose a sentence; then the suggestion of offering him a
new trial comes up.
MR. ROGOW:

What is your response to that?
Our position is that he would have

to ba offered a new trial with the benefit of counsel.

No

double jeopardy problem would be raised because this would
be in effect an appeal, a voluntary act by the defendant

5
in accepting a new trial»
Q

What if he said, "Ho thank you, Your Honor,

I want to stand on the trial I've had"?
MR. ROGOW:

I think that he could, waive counsel

even at that point only if he was clearly advised of the
consequences of his act, he was clearly advised that this
judge was considering putting him in jail or he was going
to put him in jail.
Q

Let’s assume he is a little more sophisticated

than some defendants and he answers the judge1 . sug
by saying, "Ho thank you, Your Honor.

I’ve tried ray case

as well as I think it can be tried by anyone.
is closed and it's your decision."

And the case

Except he makes the

point, "You can't send me into any confinement and 1 will
not accept a new trial.”
MK. ROGOW;
have, that option.

X don’t think that he would really

X think that he has the option to waive

the right to counsel at that point if the court has
explained to him the circumstances that exist, the real
threat that, he may go to jail.

X don’t think he can, in

effect, have his cake and eat it too and say, "How you've
tried me and now I’m' going to take this trial because I
know you can’t incarcerate me."
I think that he has to make a decision between
one or the other.

And I think if he failed to make that

6
decision asci, if he stood, on that first trial, I don't think
the decision would be able to be reversed.
Q

Yov don’t see any double jeopardy problems

even if at the outset of the trial he had asked for
counsel and been denied it and at the end of the trial
said that he wanted to stand on that trial and wouid
oppose, object to, a new trial on any terms.
MR. ROGOWs

If he had been advised at tha outset

that there was an actual threat of incarceration and that
he may very well go to jail and that he had a right to
counsel and counsel would be appointed and he waived his
right-Q

My assumption is that at the outset he asked

for counsel and the judge said, "No, I am not going to
appoint counsel," and the judge then thinking he was not
going to impose any confinement.

Now, in my hypothesis the

judge has changed his mind because of some factor
intervening.
MR. ROGOWt

In that rare instance I think the

judge might be left with the fact that he will not be able
to impose incarceration if there has been a clear situation
originally where the man did request counsel and the judge
had made up his mind there would be no imprisonment.
think that is a rare case though.
happens in most of these cases--

I think that what

I

7
Q

Would it be rare if this rule were

structured as suggested?,
MR. F..DGOW:

X do not think it would fos rare *

Your Honor, because I think that in very few of those

,

relatively minor offenses—and I mean very minor offenses
for instance violations in the City of New York which

carry a maximum penalty of IS days—-very few people actually
go to jail in those cases.

A

statistic contained in our

brief at page 40 shows that over 1,800,000 people were
tried in New York on these minor viola

s and only SO

were actually incarcerated.
So, I think there really is some practical
recognition made every day in every court in the country
that some offenses, although they carry the possibility
because the ordinance says 15 days, there is no real actual
possibi1ity of incarceration.
Our position is essentially drawn from a long
line of cases beginning with Powe11 v, Alabama through
Johns021 v. Serbst, Gideon v. Walnwright, In re Gault, and
Coleman v„^Alabama.

In this long line of cases, the Court

has consistently held that the right to counsel is
fundamental.

It is essential to the fact-finding process,

and a fair trial cannot be held without the guiding hand
of counsel at every point.
As the Court said in Gideon, riXn our adversary

8
system of criminal justice., any person hailed into court
v?ho is too poor to hires a lawyer cannot be assured a fair
trial unless counsel is provided for him."

Wo submit thal

•those words from Gideon are equally applicable to a case
where a man may lose his liberty for even one darn
Several courts have held that there in no
distinction to be drawn by the Constitution but':-non loan
of liberty for a long period of time and a loan of liberty
for

St

short pericci.

Nearly 30 yearn ago in Evene v. Edves

the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia said just
that, that the Constitution draws no distinction between
loss of liberty for a long time and a short time.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit has held in every case that has come before it
that the right to counsel extended to the indigent
misdemeanant or traffic violator who was faced with, as in
each case that was presented to the Fifth Circuit, 90 days,
that in each of those cases the right to counsel extended.
There is no real hard and fast rule, though, in
the Fifth Circuit because the Fifth Circuit decisions have
been on a case-by-case basis.

In one case, James v.

Headley, Judge Wisdom writing for himself alone urged the
position that we urge here today, that any time there is an
actual threat of incarceration, a person should be provided
co\insel„

That position is supported by the ABA Committee

on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, which urges a
very similar position • almost; exactly like ours <.
The President's Comission on Crime ant Law
Enforcement has urged a similar position..

So, t: . position

that we submit to the Court today is not one that has not
been recognised either judicially or by established
committees of the Bar.
Q

Does that mean where a statute carries a

possible jail sentence,less than six months, that if the
actual penalty imposed doesn't include a jail sentence, the
defendant needn’t have counsel?
MR. ROGOW:

He need not be advised of his right

to counsel.

Q

So, when

you

say

actual threat, what

»

you're really saying is that if a judge is going to try a
person without counsel, he cannot impose a jail sentence...
MR. ROGOW:
Q

Exactly, Your Honor.

But if he doesn't and if the possible penalty

is less than six months—-if he doesn't impose a jail
sentence on him, ha doesn't need to have counsel in any
case.
MR. RQGOW:

If the judge does not impose a jail

sentence and there is no actual threat of a jail sentence,
then on the theory we advance there would be no need to
appoint-

10

Q

It depends on when you judge that actual

threat.
MR. ROGOW:

I understand; 'the difficulty is that

it has to be sort of a pre-judgment, and this Court has
acknowledged that kind of judgment in the criminal contempt
eases dealing with right to a jury trial where if a decision
is made by the presiding judge that this defendant may get
more than six months, there has to be a jury trial provided»
There are faults in this position.

1 would

prefer, I think, a flat-out rule that any time a person
faces even the remotest possibility of incarceration, he
should be provided counsel.

But the rule we advance and

the rule that is supported by the Solicitor General takes
into consideration the practical aspects of what goes on
every day in the low visibility of the criminal justice
system, and that is that many minor offenders, sidewalk
spitters,

jaywalkers*--these are always the kinds of

offenses that are raised in the decisions which seek to
limit the right to counsel—those people do not actually
face the threat of incarceration.
Of course, under the ordinance they may.

But it

is such a remote possibility that we submit that the real
threat of incarceration does not exist.
Only ten states still adhere to a firm and
inflexible rule that the right to counsel extends only to

11
felon :uSS c

Phe other

Gideon V. _ Histmw ight <
all of them do.

What

is say that if impris
the Court must appoint counsel»

Several other states have
const:!

grounds.

The Minnesota deviat

making power of that court.

Hew Jersey in Rodriquez ?.

Rosenblatt arrived at the same conclusion based upon its
own laws.
But what is Important in looking at the states
is that they have moved into the field of providing counsel
for misdemeanors, and there is no great fear on the part
of the states that providing such counsel will cause them
any great harm.
The arguments that have been advanced in limiting
the right to counsel to an excess of six months cases are
based upon one or several of the following theories.

First,

that because the right to counsel and the right to jury
trial both reside in the Sixth Amendment, the right to
counsel must be governed by this Court's decision in the
jury trial case Baldwin v. New York.

We subra.lt that that

argument is just not valid.
There is a great difference between counsel and
a jury trial.

As the Court recognized in Baldwin, a fair

12
trial can be had without a. jury,,

And, , in fact, every cay

fair trie, Is are had without a jury by a judge aloae.

But

a lawyer is essential to the fact-finding process and a
lawyer must be there to hammer out the facts which the
decider will have to consider.

Therefore, the analogy

between jury trial and counsel is not valid.
And one other reason; I think this Court has
recognised that the analogy isn't valid in holding the
right to counsel retroactive but in refusing to hold the
right to a jury trial retroactive.
Another argument advanced in the cases which
seek to limit the right to counsel is that becansa the right
fco counsel and a jury trial both reside in the Sixth
Amendment, Baldwin v. Hew York must govern.
other rights in the Sixth Amendment,

But there are

There is the right

to a public trialv the right to a speedy trial, the right
fco confront the witnesses against you, the right to
compulsory process.

No court has ever held to my knowledge

that those rights are contingent upon a sentence which
exceeds six months.

So, any argument that because all these

rights reside in the same amendment, they are governed by
Baldwin v. New York, just does not hold.
Another argument advanced by people seeking to
limit the right fco counsel is that the Criminal -Justice
Act, Title

18,

U. S. Code, Section 3006a,

which is

13
the federal standard for appointed counsel for appointed
counsel limits appointed counsel only to cases which
exceed six months.
of counsel.

But that law relates only to the payment

It does not set a firm rule that counsel

shall not be provided in so-called petty offenset.

In fact,

to the contrary# the frsitters of the law in legislative
history support the conclusion that they believe that the
right to counsel did exist to petty offenses, or;,! they left
the criminal justice act open-ended so that vov. ,.:1 fill
be able to be paid if this Court holds that the right to
counsel dees extend beyond or in cases that carry less than
a six months penalty.
Q

Earlier in your argument, Mr. Rogov?, you said

that you were supported by the government, and I know that's
true basically.

However, the constitutional rule that they

submit is not identical feo the one you submit? is that
correct?
MR. ROGOWs
Q

As 1 read it, it is identical.

A little more finely spun out perhaps.

MR. ROGOWs

A matter of semantics, I think,

becomes involved, yes, sir.
Q

But you would be happy and content with the

government's submission, would you?
MR. EOGOW:

Mot altogether, Your Honor.

There

are points in the government's submission that I would not

agree with in every facet.
itself we do agree,.

But in terms of this rule

There is no disagreement.

The

government has excluded a great many other cases which we
think do not need to be decided today but may in the future
be presented.

But for the purpose of this case, there is

no disagreement between the government and ourselves.
Another argument raised—
Q

What about pleas of guilty, same rule?

MR. ROGGWs

Yes; there has to be advice of

counsel acceptance of a plea.
Q

The plea is a crucial time.

Not if he is only going to be fined.

MR. ROGOW:

I'm sorry, if there is only going to

be a fine, there would be no need to advise a man of his
right to counsel.
What we are really asking is judicial recognition
of the practical procedure that takes place every day.

We

are saying there are millions of cases tried in this
country, first offense speeding, things like that where ho
one goes to jail although the ordinance says perhaps a tenday penalty would be imposed.

But no one doss go to jail.

And we are saying that the judiciary does in fact every day
make these determinations.
Q

Does anyone have any statistics at all on

what kind of extra burden this would be on the legal system
or on the attorneys of the country?

How many under six

15
months cases acts result in jail sentences?
alt, XCGOtfz

Tee figures on that are rot reliable

and really do not exist.
Q

Are we talking of a million, a hundred

thousand or ten thousand or what?
MR. ROGOWs

The statistics that X—«for instance,

in New York where there are 1,800,000 persons charged with
violations, only 40 actually went to jail.

I can really

speak only in terras of same practical experience in Dado
County.

About 400,000 people are faced with trettic

offenses in cases tried in the Metro Court.

But only about

5000 of those people ever actually face incarceration.
Q

What do you mean, actually face—arc 5000

people actually sent to jail?
MR. ROGQW:
Q

Per year?

MR. RGGOW:
0

Yes, sir, incarcerated.

Per year.

5000 additional trials a year in which there

would have to be counsel.
MR. ROGOW:
Q

Yes, sir.

Does that include things like drunken driving,

manslaughter, and so on?
MR. ROGOWs
Q

Yes, sir.

That includes a lot of cases then where they

would have to have counsel anyway.

Q

Let me be sure I've got your figure clear.

MR. ROGOW:

Court is 60 days or $500 fine.

Yes, Your Honor, but it may change

It may result in guilty pleas where there

This does not.

This builds only upon

the prior decisions of the Court.

Q

Tour observations certainly have a relevance

to metropolitan centers.

What about isolated rural areas

where they are either not covered by any legal aid or
defender system at all or one that's on » regional cocio
where the legal aid office may be a hundred miles away from
the particular small town court?
MR, ROGOW:

In those cases, for instance,

Mississippi cornos to mind where they have rural areas, they
have a circuit court which travels.

And at a certain time

during -die year that circuit court sits, and there are
defense counsel available.

We would submit that in that

hind of a situation when the trial court which tries felonxe
comes to town—
Q

T-he mobile court is not a common phenomenon

in the country anymore, is it?
MR. ROGOW:

that .
MR. 101017s

Y.es, sir, but even in those

: es the

defendant must move to the court in a felony case and there
must be counsel provided.

All we are saying would be

necessary would be for this misdemeanant to move to that
same court.
Q

In many states again the defendant is not to

be tried in the same court, in a felony court.

He's off

in a local police court of some kind more often than not,
I would think.
MR. ROGOWi
Q

In a municipal court of some kind.

Yes.

MR. R0G0W:

And if there is no counsel available,

is that the Court’s question?

The only thing that we

suggest that can be done would be to have, some kind of
legislation passed in that kind of a state where the trial
court of criminal cases, of felony cases', would have
jurisdiction to try—
Q

Then your suggestion about this having no

impact, but the people that have refused to extend the
right to counsel hare raised the spectre of counsel for
sidewalk spitters and jaywalkers, and they have exaggerate!
the need for counsel because they do not take into
consideration the practicals day-to-day situations in
these courts.
Q

Mr. Rogov, let jo© ask you along the line of

the Chief Justice’s questions„ the situation in ny heme
state of Arizona where Coconino County has an area of

20,000 square relies and has one county seat whore the
Superior Court; aits; but justice courts that are spread out
over an. area that is larger than that of many of the a cates
where ordinarily there simply are not lawyers in residence,
wouldn't the application of your rule virtually require, the
abolition of justice court jurisdiction in an area of that
sise?
MRROGQWs

Sot necessarily.

It might require

that the penalty imposed by the justice court would have
to be less than incarceration but not necessarily do away
with the jurisdiction of the justice court in any way.Of course, X am no t aware of how many people
actually face incarceration, in those cases.

This is not going to be «omathing that

will just ha taken overnight and implemented without any
discomfort at all to the state.
Recently in Mayer v. City of Chicago this Court
has held that when a fundamental right is involved, the

those changes are nowhere near as great as some people
would have us believe.
One of the other arguments that is raised in
opposition to any attempt to extend the right to counsel
is the rules for the trial of minor offenses before
magistrates.

Our position on that is that those rules in

How many--in terms of comparative analysis

MR., ROGOW:

I believe the Solicitor General' s

brief used a figure of 150,000 or 200,000, 'I am not sure
exactly.

But in his brief his submission is that the

federal system could incorporate the rule that we advocate
without any great difficulty.
Q

For the magistrates.

MR. ROGOWs

Yes, for the magistrates.

X*:r sorry.

hn equal protection argument exists also in this

case, and that is where we have a classification, i-s.de by
the State of Florida denying counsel to some and
guaranteeing counsel to others, we submit the equal protec­
tion clause would equally guarantee counsel in this case
and that that and the due process clause of the J.4fch
Amendment would apply.
1 would like to reserve five minutes for rebuttal.

MR. GRISWOLD?

.

GRIStSOLp, BSQ. ,

AS AMICUS CURIAE

May it pis-.;;- the Court:

Perhaps 14'&m too unreconstructed, but X find it
easier to think of the legal problas- in this'case is :

..ss

of the 5th and 14th Amendments rather than in t-arms

tea

right-fco-counse1 provision in the Sth Amendment„
a state ease, end if the 6th Amendment is applicabit

it

is through the-; 14th Amendment.

As far as the 6th Amendm-t-nt alone is raca:

^ . ,

"there are in seme minds at least scar; verbal or decor;;' aar;.
difficulties.

By its language -cite 6th Amendment aro.a. .:

only the right to have counsel and not the right to have
counsel supplied.

I know that the contrary was decided in

the Gideon case and that this was said to rest on the 6th
Amendment.

For some, though, this has a more understandable

foundation than the 14th Amendment.
Then there is the fact that the Sth Amendment by
its terms is applicable in. all criminal prosecution, and.
the Court has decided in Duncan and Baldwin that the right to
a jury trial, also provided by the 6th Amendment, is
applicable where the penalty is more than sir months.

On

this basis it is contended as it was decided below that
the right-to-counsel provision can be applicable only
where more than six months imprisonment is involved.

Of course, there are. authorities for saying that
the atare eordr: in e statute >::• oonutitution may
different meanings in different appli
some intellectual strain,,

T is

Invol'

Bub, as 1 hare =•:aid, it is

easier for me to deal with the problem in terms -1 the
lith Amendment»

After ail, it is a case of procuiurai

due process which lies at the heart of the 14th Amendment»
And, too, we are more accustomed to think of due process

as a developing idea than we are to find such flexibility
in some of the earlier amendments.
On this basis, I look at the Gideon case which,
with respect, seems to me to have a thoroughly sound clue
process foundation; in considering the right to counsel, X
cannot find any basis, any logical ground to stand on, for
saying that the right to counsel exists for imprisonment
of six months or more but does not apply for imprisonment
for less than six months.
1 recognize that lines have to be drawn in the*
law like the age of majority and that cases close to the
line on each side will not be very different from each
other.

However, with respect to imprisonment, I find it

hard to draw the line any place,
seems to me,to be substantial.

Five months imprisonment,
I do not find much help

when the time is reduced to ten days or five days.

There

seems to me to be a difference in kind between imprisonment

serious

not involve depriving a person of his liberty, and this
'

found myself forced to the conclusion that there should be
a due process right to counsel and that this right should
be applicable before any term of imprisonment can ba
imposed.
G

On that line drawing f Mr

Solicitor Gee -.-al,

that means one day or one hour as well as six months?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Any imprisonment at all is the

only place where I can find a satisfactory place to draw
the line, drawing a distinction between imprisonment and
monetary penalties of one kind or another.
Obviously there are problems at the borderline?
as the cases mentioned by my associate here where a
statute authorizes imprisonment but it's rarely imposed.
X should think that in such cases the prosecutor or judge
should make the determination in advance? or if something
develops at the trial which makes imprisonment seem
appropriate and the defendant has not had counsel, whether
he had waived it or not before that without a clear
understanding that imprisonment was a likely consequence,
there should at the defendant’s request be a new trial

28
where counsel will be provided and very li&ely before a
different judge,,

If in answer to the Chief Justice’s

question he says, "Well, I stand on that trial," I take
that to be a waiver of his right to counsel.

But he should

have a right to have counsel at a new trial.

If ha

doesn't want it, it shouldn't he forced cn him.
This conclusion that counsel should be Bade
available for an indigent defendant before any teru: of
imprisonment is imposed
has been reached by two eminent bodies which have considered
this problem, not as judges but as persons vitally
interested in developing proper standards for the
administration of criminal justice.

These are the American

Bar Association in its minimum standards for criminal
justice and the President's Commission on, Law Enforcement
and Administration of Justice.

Both are cited or. page 17

of our brief.
The Bar Association recommendation on this matter
has in substance been approved at least three times by
the House of Delegates of the Association, which is a large
and representative group of the profession.
Because of these reports and, actions, I have more
confidence in the conclusion to which I have felt myself
impelled as an intellectual matter, namely, that counsel
must be made available to an indigent before any sentence

29

of imprisonroent can be imposed.

also confirmed by the

excellent- opinion of Justice Jacobs of the $ups .

Q

Juiti before you move on, hr, j3o3.iait.or

General, is Rodrigues y, Rosenblatt cited in your brief?
Ms. GRISWOLD:

No, 1 am sorry, Mr, Chief Justice,

it is not cited in our brief.

It is 58 New Jersey 281 and

277 Atlantic Second 2,16,
Although our information about the manpower
situation is sketchy, what we have is encouraging.

As

far as the federal courts are concerned, counsel is new
required in all cases.unless it is waived.

That’s Rule

44-A of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and 1 sv.y th-;
same is applicable with respect to trials in the magistrates
courts because any defendant there may elect to have a
trial in the district court where he can have counsel
assigned to him if he chooses in order to save time and to
get it. over with, which X think is often the situation in
these cases, to go ahead in the magistrates court.

He has

had a right to go to the district court and have counsel,

and X find it
not 'unlikely that

:

■

for compensation for counsel in these cases

because it has not' been amended to say wherever it's
required by the Constitution and if this Court so decides
then it will be covered.

All cases involving any

imprisonment have long been covered in the District of
Columbia V,-here there are, of course, many petty offensesf
and this has not proved to be unbearable.
As far as the situation in the states is
concerned, there is more room for concern.

However, the

problems will probably not be as serious in actuality as
the statistics on the number of cases would indicate.

In

the first place, it appears that nearly half of the states
now cover all or nearly all of these cases.

To that

extent™-to the extent that increases in services are
required, 'the raw figures need to be adjusted because it
undoubtedly is true that it takes less time to -try most
misdemeanors than it does the more serious cases.
Moreover, it is likely that counsel will be
waived more often in cases of petty offenses.

And it seems

to me that waivers might well be more readily accepted in
cases of this sort than where the charge is of a serious

31
: the defendant in responsa to inquiry from the

,

at he does not want counsel

it should not be

forced on him when the right to counsel and the usefulness
of counsel are somewhat attenuated as they are here.
We have considerable light on all of iivxse
questions in the two briefs amicus curiae whici
ft Inn In this cnnnr cu bahalf of the f, j.al Aid Society of
New York which sets out actual experience in. n situ-7.ti.or
where counsel are required in cases of this sort in ox-:
most congested metropolitan area, and the National Longue
of Lay Defender Association, and an bus bean said notch the
same information is contained in an article of

a

recent

issue of the William and Msrv Law Review.
New York has for some time provided for
representation .in • cases where imprisonment may he impe-reci,
and the New York Legal Aid Society shows'that the loud cun
he handled.

Similarly the other brief and the article

summarise experience in other places which indicates that
the load, though substantial, is not unmanageable..

On the

.basis of this information and experience 1 find myself
led to the conclusion that the chances ar© that the
adoption by this Court of a rule that counsel must be
furnished before any imprisonment may be imposed would
result in increasing the man hours required of defensecounsel by 50 or 60 percent.

This is a serious matter, but

in:ervbla.

I do not

X have tried to

put together soma figures, but they are n

too mcert ::..

On the basis of those figures
many as 3000 additional lawyers would bo required,

At

$10,000 a year, that would be a cent of $30 million.

Id

it might get up to as much as $50
financial load, this should be manageable when allocated to
the 50 states even though some of the larger states would
have to carry a considerable part of the load.
But California and Illinois and New York now
provide for counsel in these cases»

Thus a considerable

part of the additional load is already undertaken.

Other

states should now be guided to do likewise, just as was the
situation when the Gideon case itself was decided.
In this connection with respect to the availability
of lawyers to carry the task, X am encouraged by the
presently existing fact that there are now twice as many
students in the nation’s law schools as there were ten
years ago, that young lawyers are starting their practice
in unprecedented numbers, and that it is estimated that the
number of lawyers in the country will double within the next
12 or 13 years.
Already concern is being expressed about the
openings which will be available for these new lawyers»

and then rely on local courts, bar associations, legal aid
agencies and so on, to try to find, ways to see that the
representation is appropriately provided, consistent with
the efficiency of the courts.
This also is a matter of legitimate concern.

Do you

link court reporter as an

imperative in every case where there is a lawyer just
automatically?
MR. GRISWOLDs

Shis Court has more or less

intimated as much in acme cases.

It is rather difficult

to carry out an appeal without a transcript, and I would
suspect as a practical matter that it would be found that
court reporters Were necessary where counsel were provided.
Q

Would you agree that that's probably a greater

problem than the problem of counsel?
MR. GRISWOLD:

No, but I think it’s a serious

problem not only in these cases but in ail criminal cases
that we ought to find ways to improve, perhaps by putting
court reporters on salaries .rather than having them paid bypiecework as we now do.

Q

Have we over done that at a constitutional

MR. GRISWOLD:

I don't know, Mr. Justice.

that this is getting out to a place where things are very
attenuated, and I find it easier to accept that recognition
of not fully complying with what the Court now regards the
Constitutional requirement to be than it is to say, dial!,

requirements.

I wouldn't have put it that way myself.

X

would simply have said that in the process of effectuating
a change, it is not inappropriate to allow the time which
is in fact required to carry out the change.

Q

What about relief in this case?

MR. GRISWOLD2

In tills case, I would grant relief

and hold that this petitioner is entitled to counsel at a
new trial.

Q

And you couldn't postpone the application of

39
ths rule in his case?
Kft. miZ-.iQblii

Ho, 2 wouldn’t in Mb case.

1

would try to hole it clown as little a.a possible, but I donr t
see how you can say, if this Court decides this
May 10thr that on May 11th there shall be counsel in every
court or else the tab

ail all be invalid even for

short terms in the work house.
Many cf these petty offenses will really be quite
petty.

It seems to me that it would be very helpful if

this Court's decision could make it plain that under
appropriate circumstances the right to counsel does not
require the presence of a fully qualified member of the
bar.

For example, many of these cases migi^t be handled ■

very effectively by law students under proper supervision,
and it would be helpful if this Court's decision could
recognize that possibility.
I have been familiar with the activities of law
students in court, and 1 would say from experience that they
provide excellent service.

Usually they have much more time

available than practicing lawyers, and they work on our
cases with great energy and enthusiasm.

It might also be

that other persons could serve as counsel in certain types
of cases involving relatively small sentences.

These might

include clergymen, social workers, probation officers, and
other persons of that type.

40
hnd finally 'C bars greef concern ;.; I or f the more
tli©' country, Wyoming or Idaho or Horth
Dakota or upstate New York.

There may well be cases of

family assaults where a short jail sentence is appropriate
and where there is no lawyer within a hundred miles.

In

such cases it seems to me that the real need might be met
by the appearance on behalf of the defendant of the minister

udghi-,

leave some flexibility so that cases in remote areas
involving r s .1 at ire ly mi nor p e n •: ■ 1 tie s m i.ghi be handled with
some sort of appropriate representation other than that
of fully qualified legal counsel.

This seems to me to be

adequately consistent with the due process concept in cases
where the requirement of counsel is clearly stretched close
to its limit.

On this basis s I submit the decision below

of this Court.

Oh? no? I would hope you can?

You can waive juries.

You can waive everything.

You can waive a speedy trial.

The last time we argued this casa, I told

you that in terras of what it would mean to Florida? we had
dropped corn to, well, 60 percent be lot? what would be the
rule if we adopted as the basis for your future decision
• %

what you did in adopting the rules for your practice before
magistrates,

Wa’re down to 60 days on our split

misdemeanors, if you recall.
On the I4th of March in Florida, along with &
number of people who think they are going to fine! out who
is going to be the presidential nominee for either the
Democrats or the Republicans, we’re going to vote oft
Article V, which is a revamping of the court structure of
the State of Florida,

One of the provisions that will be

voted on is the total abolition of all municipal eburts
in the state,

Mow, you don’t have long to wait once you

get to the 14th? one day beyond that and the canvassing
board will certify the results.

We won't even have any

municipal courts.
So, remembering what it was , down to 60' days in
Florida by our own legislature, we’re down even below what
was done in Woo ley in 'the Jacksonville District Court,
Wa’re certainly down below what was done in MacDonnel and

*

48
Harvey, and we're certainly down below what would be the
basia if we used your procedure before magistrates.

We

get «away with the municipal courts and we're down to what?
We’re down to county courts, which will be the second strata
of what we get if Article V is adopted and Ida sure that it
will be.

But who knows what the voters will do?
But let’s assume for the moment that tint's no.

What do we do now about speedy trials?

Bristol is the county seat cf Liberty

There are 2800 people in the whole county.

There hasn’t been a lawyer there for over 30 years.

I’ll

admit they have a circuit that sits occasionally when they
have litigation.

But as to those individuals who violate

the ordinances of the city, there is no one to whom they
can go, and there is no one in the court

to whom they can

turn for an appointment because there is nobody around.
There simply aren't any lawyers and there is no reason for
them to be there.
What do we do for them?

Do we say, “Now, you're

going to have to wait until the circuit court gets here
so that he can appoint somebody to representyou"?

any the worse off for it.
I don’t advocate that as a good notion.,

All 1

am telling you is that these are things that do occur.
After, the Dickey decision, the Florida Supreme Court
decided to adopt a rule regarding speedy trials, which they
did«

They broke it into 180 days cold or on demand 60 days.

It got so bad in Dade County, which is the source of the
400fOOO figure Mr. Rogow gave you, that the state attorney’s
office had to make a special plea to the Florida Supreme
Court to extend the deadline on it because otherwise 690
men would get a walkout because they couldn’t meet the
deadline, which they did, by the way.
So, piecemeal they have to make an adjustment.
How much time do you give a man for a speedy trial who
faces the prospect of three days, five days, ten days?
I don't know.

You certainly can’t make it much longer than

Q

Aren't most misdemeanors automatically

bailable in Florida?
MR. GEORG.IEFF;
Q

Oh, cartainly.

So, the pressure for a speedy trial from the

defendant will presumably be a little bit less than if they
were being held in jail pending trial.
MR. GEORGIEFF:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, all

felonies, with the exception of capital and just recently
those punishable by life imprisonment have always been
bailable as a matter of right.

But that didn't stop the

speedy trial demand.
Q

Isn’t there a higher percentage of persons

awaiting felony trials being held for want of bail or a
decision of the court that the person should not in fact
be bailed but it is a case of misdemeanors.
MR. GBORGIEFF:

That’s possibly so, but it's

only because of the amount of bail, you see.

My heavenly

days, we are far from a severe state in terms of bail,
you wind up with anything over $7500 bail and it’s a
miracle.

As a matter of fact, right now in Florida on

traffic violations in municipal courts you have an option
at which you can request a trial in a county court with a
jury.

Now, that isn’t exercised too often because it

involves money and lawyers.

But the moment they find that

must be set forth clearly in any decision that the Court
reaches, set forth in such a way so that it is clear that
the trial court will advise a defendant, not just that he
has a right to counsel and a right to appoint a counsel
but advise a defendant that that trial judge has concluded
that there is a real, actual threat of incarceration and
