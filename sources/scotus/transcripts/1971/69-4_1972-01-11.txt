MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

He will hear arguments

State Cofrimission oE Investigation»
Mr, Querques, you may proceed ‘whenever you are ready
'ORAL ARGUMENT OP MICHAEL A. QUERQUES, ESQ.
COUNSEL FOR TEE APPELLANT, MR. JOSEPH A. ZICARELLZ
MM. QUERQUES;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The facts of this particular matter, sparse as they
are, warrant some little attention here this morning.

Some-

tic.: i"i 1969, Mr. Zicerelli was served with a subpoena to
appear before a new Commission in Mew Jersey which is called
the State Commission of Investigation.

The State Commission

of investigation was operating under something else which was
new in Haw Jersey and that is a so-called "use immunity" or
"testimonial immunity" statute.
Consequently, as the result of being asked questions
and being offered the immunity which was provided for by this
•statute, Mr. 2 leave Hi
M

chose to invoke his privilege under

Fifth Amendment not to testify on the grounds the "use

iEMVinifcvY" so-called,, was not sufficient.
in fluit

'r,;. n&t and ultimately was held in contempt and

ooy of. wao
,t\

He was not upheld

to the New Jersey Supreme Court and, again,

tv ■ ■:; privilege under the Fifth was denied.
roofIt of which, under the statute in New

,/, too sono shat peculiar statuta, lie. Zicarelli

v.

...............

iv-.v a.'.:.c rosi of Mss life because the statute in New Jersey
provides for no particular period of confinement and it was a

vi; oo-tempt, civil confinement and as I say, no pavi-.imx5.6U!?
perio6 of cut-off.
Q,

Moll, if he had answered the questions, would ha

have been released?
MR. QU'ERQUES:

Yes, Your Honor, he would have boor.

released.
Q

But he did, as in moat civil contempts, ho

carried the case to jail in hi a cm pocket.
MR, QUi!RQ.UES:

That is accurate, Your Honor, yes,

iso wo are faced then in this ee.so with the ultimate

:i cuo - - to whether or not the so-called "use" or "testimonial
:l ■. surity" is consistent with the Fifth Amendment and this
ultimate issue, as far as I could make it out from all of the
w..

trjvt T. hare road depends upon the particular answer that

you give to the on© single test, and that is whether or not
t-ho fitness is in the same position after ho has testified as
though he : h not testified and therefore, I would like to
■/ i :h \..orning to persuade this Court that a witness such as

fie v. v; 1X1 vontu; bo in a fan worse position after ho
Lifi.u then if bo had not testified under this use immunity

MR. QUERQ.UESs

Chief Judge Saits says that th

is not in the

m

position as though he had not testified

hee'-.vj.-v c-.,.c;e th. District Attorney would have that compelled
testimony, the District Attorney would be able to use that
compelled testimony in cross examination*

And Chief Judge Soits

c■ ya, ©von if there were no overt reference to the compelled
testimony, the questions could bo phrased in such a way that the
t-f ft.-:: compelled testimony would necessarily impeach end
d .:, j the &ofondant.

That is not quite xajr question#

Whan he is in

Grand fey appearance, or in your case, appearance before the
Commission, in then a anything that prevents him from using
the Fifth AuoMmont if he is subjected 'to a question which he
thinks in and of itself will incriminate him?
MR, QUERQUES:

Well, I think that question is also

to'./ Jud/e Beits and that argument goes along these

a "warm chair. **

The chair

rt to him occupier by the lawyer is just as warm .for the
lawyer.

Indeed, it might ho vary, very warm.

It might be hot.

hGC'ivsa the lawyer wcuXd heva to be concerned that if his
client .took the second choice, to wit, perjury, the lawyer
might ultimately be accused of suborning that perjury.
And if we get down to the third possibility, and
that is contempt, the lawyer then really is useless to the client,
because if the client says to the lawyer, "Under this situation,
I'm going to go do some time in jail until the statute of
limitations runs out," there isn’t anything.that the lawyer
can do for him.

So X say for these reasons and many others which

1 don’t have time to elucidate on, and hopefully, sons of the
■ .:. ;r lawyers whc appear in the other two cases will, that
transactional ir.amity as it presently stands should remain;
that use immunity is very, very foreign to our system of justice
li will work such hazards and will work such injustices as time
will prove if it ever comes to foe.

LPPBLEIsIG AS AMICUS CURIAE

&R. FJGlbte

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I appear Lore, es Amicas to support the position of
the Appellee, the State Crime Investigation Commission of
Hew Jersey, and the 24 states that join in the views expressed
in our Brief.
It should he noted that the states still bear the
primary resporsibility for enforcement of the criminal law.
eriv.es are k'.sz tainly matters of local concern.

Most

These immunity

ehrtutas have barn <?.;•> extremely important part of our arsenal
r-.ri fighting crime, particularly organized crime and official
corruption.

One of the most important powers of any government

in presenting the iffiltration of crime in that government is
the power to compel citizens to testify in court before Grand
Juries or agencies such as the State Crime Investigation
Commission«

On the other hand, we recognize that, one of the most
teyort-mfc privileges ci: any citizen is the Fifth Amendment
privilege orainst s-rlf-incrimination.

Obviously, there must be.

elate - struck foetesaa the power on the one hand to compel a
■■'beere: to w:.rti.vv
.-pete.Lev he

r eburt ; eel the privilege on the other that
