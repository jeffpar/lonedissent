ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL F. LSPKOW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT TOWNSEND, ETC.
MRc LEFKOW;

Mir, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
The State of Illinois makes payments,under its
federally subsidised program of Aid to FamijJ.es with Dependent
Children, to needy dependent children between the ages ©■

IS

to 2.X years old attending a vocation*! or*, technical training
school, but denies payments to children attending a junior
college, a college, or a university.
The issue in this case is whether the discrimination
is inconsistent with the requirements end the purposes of the
Social Security Act and the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Mrs. Georgia Townsend and her daughter Omega ware a
family within the meaning of the Act, and Omega was a dependent
child.

But they were cut eff and denied any aid under the

AFDC program, while they met ell the requirements specified by
Congress,
Appellants rely on this Court * s decision in King vs.

4

Smith,, which invalidated Alabama5s

sclvsxmt of.

absolute

discrualiflection of eligible children on the- ficfc.-l.on fch&fe they
had a substitute father*

Illinois likewise has defined '’dependent children*' in .?. rr.-evr-.:..:
inconsistent with ufea

and its purposes f by totalling

Act

excluding from AFDC benefits children attending a collega or a
university»
We believe that Kinj| clearly prohibits Illinois *
absolute disqualificat'ion»

A reading of King requires rm i''t -.:-a

pro tat ion of the definitional section for Section 406 (?)

llr-t

A

it is mandatory upon -the State of Illinois to provido scmo
aid to all those defined by Congress as depend
This requirement on the States was affirmed by this Ccr -rfc in
Dandridge vs» Williams:

that in order to "void violating the

statute itself* a state must provide seme aid to all eligible
families and all eligible children.
Now* we submit that in addition to these two casae
there ar© a number of other importent radons why this statute
is mandatory.
One is the plain meaning of fcae statute? another i:i.
it’s necessary to make it mandatory to swid frustrating the
purposes of the Act? it's necessary for harmonious construction
of the federal statutory schema ? ifc*o necessary brcause cf toco
legislative history? it’s necessary to avoid an equal protectior

5

violation? and itss roeass&ry to prevent Illinois from with~
drawing from this part of the M’DC program.
1611 return to the plain meaning of tfco utatotr.
The State has- asserted that it hao discretion whetdvir
it wants to adopt the definitional section of 406(a).

Wc

submit that the plain wording of the statute grants the ftato:?
no discretion.
A similar section, Section 407'*. on its face, grretc
the States discretion to participate in the unemployed or veh-I;.:.?employed program, which was added to the Act in 1961.

And tills

Court has stated in King vs. Smith that that, particular section

407 is optional with the State; but there's nothing on the face
of the statute in 406(a) to indicate that fcfc© State has
discretion to pick and choose among the children made eligible
by Congress,
We submit that the legal standard for testing a
State's compliance is the Act itself.
Next, it*© necessary to smite it mandatory to avoid
frustrating the purposes of the Act,

The purpose of the Act,

as interpreted by this Court in King, is for the protection of
dependent children.

That is the paramount goal.

And Congress#

in 1964, in amending the Social Security Act, stated that the
assumption that children are no longer dependent is not valid

as applied to children still attending school.
Further, by denying these children

MR. LEFEOWs

Xn terras of equal protection, it is, if

you distinguish between children attending a vocational eocl
technical school and those attending a collega or university,
up to age 21.
In measuring — in determining violation of equal
protection, you have to take into consideration the purposes of
•the Act; and the purpose of this Act is tc provida AFDC
sustenance benefits up to age 21.

So, measured in tens® of

purpose cf the Act, denial to college and university students
would be a denial of equal protection; because, w@ submit, that
there is simply no rational basis' for what the state has dons
by saying that "unless it says over the .dear of the school it’s
a technical or vocational sch

.

children aid", in spite of the fact that much technical and

vocational education is provided in j -an.?, or eollacais, in colleger
and universities.

In fact, the State of Illinois and th©

Federal Government fund junior colleges in Illinois to the tune
of $6,5 million a year to provide technical and vocational
education.

And. these children ©re excluded from participating

in that because they don't have the money ce have the food and
•the clothing and the shelter they need so that they can attend
these schools„
Wq would further point out —
Q

Mr, Lefkow,

MR. LEFKOWs
Q

Yes?

— is it your position that the difference in

receiving aid under AFDjC and not receiving it makes the
difference between going to school or not?
MR. LEFKOW:

Yes, Your Honor, that would be our

position,
Because all &FDC does, Your Honor, is provida — bring
a person up to minimal living level, so that they have enough
money to subsist on, for food, far clothing, and for shelter.
It. doesn't provide any additional benefits.
Although 1 would point out that in this case if the
child is in a technical or vocational school, the State of
Illinois will pay substantial tuition fco these private schools.
But.

and -this same education is available in th® junior

college.

Q

Well, then,, conceding that, is not your lawsuit

MR* LEFKOWs
eligibility is.

Yes, Your Honor, that's what APDC

It provides money for sustenance benefits.

We pointed out .in our brief that she and hsr • mother have been
forced to live at an intolerable levs! of existence.

Kcr

mother is a very sick woman, suffering from systemic erythema­
tosis .

They live on about 15 conte a meal. They have no —

hardly any furniture in the house.

They're suffering terribly»

And no child should have to go through that in order
to obtain an education. And that's what Congress meant by making
sure that the sustenance benefits would be available for them.
I would further like to point out that what Illinois
has don® is caused a misallocation of federal resources.
Congress has determined that federal funds should flew to these
children, but Illinois has prohibited that :md. has unduly
limited the welfare: rolls in Illinois by approximately a thousand
children a year who might want to take advantage of this pro-

9
vision.
I would further like to j
history of the Act shows that Congress has continually expanded
eligibility to meet rising educational requirements and
opportunity, as they become available in ;>ur society.

In 1932

tli® child had to be under age 16; in 19 39 Congrum; mended it
to under 16 or under age 18 if the State .determines
is in school.

In IS56» Congress lifted the school-mgc; requir/v*

In s64 they reimposed the school-age requirement? and
in *65 they added the college and university so that the child
could be attending, in effect, any school.

As long &s he was

attending any type school in pursuit of an education, between
18 and 21, he would be eligible for thesiy benefits.
We would further like to point out that it's necessary
for this Court to hold that this section, 406(a), is mandatory
because the section itself says "when used in this part", part
(a) which is Title IV of the Social Security Act, these
definitions are used throughout the whole title of the Act.
And Section 402(a)(10), which requires the aid to be famished
with reasonable promptness, combined with faction 406(a)
clearly mandates that this child should receive some aid.
In King vs, Smith, the Court said;

in combination

these two sections clearly require that some aid be furnished.
In Dan dr idee vs. Williams, this Coart. held that a State may
allocate among those who are already on the rolls, but it must

10

provide some aid to all eligible families tad all eligible
individuals.
1 think it*s clear from the Court’s opinion in
Dandridge, in both the majority and the dissentf that fch© ora
thing everybody was agreed on is that Congest fixos - ho Coiorol
eligibility requirements.

In other words, Congress detar:Miae;j

who is dependent, and the States ere allowed to determine who
is needy,
The states have ample opportunity to protect them­
selves from adverse fiscal impact under thin Court’s decision
in Rosado, allowing percentage reductions? in D&ndridge,
allowing the imposition of maximum grants.
So that the State of Illinois need suffer no harm by
a reversal of this opinion.

And in effect, as I pointed out
y

in my Reply Brief, the fiscal effect on the State of Illinois/
>

would be minimal, it would be approximately $500,000 a year
and th© Federal Government would put up $500,000 a year, making
a total of approximately $1 million.
Wa would also like to point out to the Court that the.
State's purpose of encouraging employability, which they stated
in th© court below was the whole purpose of the State statute
denying assistance to college and university children, was to
encourage employability.

But we would submit that that

Rationale, under this Court's decision in Shapiro, is not
permissible or not logical.

In Shapiro, the Court said that

encouraging employability was r.o justification fsr irap&aing a
one-year residency requirement.

Thai if yp-u’rs going ba imogac

that typea of requirement, you'd have ao impose it ait; just on
the new residents moving into tbs Stare bet ail the residents;
and w@ submit the same type of logic applies in this ctee.
That if you’re going to requiro a child to go to work
just because he’s in a collage or university, it*a only fair,
for technical and vocational schools, that same Standard to be
applied.
However, X want to point out that HEW has clearly
prohibited working requirements while children axa t^ttendinc;
school, between the ages ©f 18 and 21.
Q

Well, your statutory argument would drop out, X

suppose, if ~~ no. it would be the same if Illinois did not
give grants to children over 18 who ar® attending vocational
schools?
ME. LBFKOWz That's correct,, Your Honor? that it’s
still mandatory on the state.
Q

Yes, it would still bo mandatory« But your

equal protection argument would not obtain'?
MR. L&FKOWs That’s correct, Your Honor.

That’s

exactly it.

MR. lEFKOWs All right. What *s your question, then,
Your Honor?
Q

Would there he any denial of equal protection

of the law in such a lav??
MR. L&FKOW3

X don’t — if X understand your

MR. LBFKOWs

And tho State went up to 18 and went no farther.

Any denial of equal protection?
MR. LEFKGW:

Not in terms of this case, Your Honor.

In other words, the college and university students, children
over age 18, there would not be a denial of equal protection.
Q

Even though most of the children over 18 would

be in college, sad most of them under 18 would be in high
school?

MR. LEFKOWs Thatas right. But, you see, in this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. JAMES SPXT2ER, JR., ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF APPELLANT ALEXANDER, ST AL„
MR. SPITSERs

Ms:. Chief Justice, ima may it please

the Courts
I should like to begin with the statutory argument,
and I should like to address initially s

1 submit that in

viewing the statutory argument, one has to look afc it. in the
framework of the AFRO program.

That Illinois, in excluding

college children from the definition of dependent children,
but including other forms of post-secondary education, that is
post-secondary vocational education, has dona somathing which
has the unfortunate effect*of perpetuating poverty, which it
clearly contrary to the purposes of the Act.
Q

Is the vocational education uniformly post-

secondary, as you’ve described it?
MR. SPIT3ER:

Is it uniformly?

No, sir.

But it is

both post-secondary and not post-secondary. They do — Illinois
presently doss provide post-secondary vocational training.
In those instances where children do not attend college, how-

14
ever, and I am including hex® the? junior colleges, public
community colleges, bacaus® both of fch® named appellants herein
did attend public community colleges.
These colleges are the only free schools that I know
of in the State of Illinois.

The vocational institutes, the

technical institutes that are included in the .appendix to fcho
Appellees Brief ar® all tuition-paying institutiens, with

tuition payments of up to $3800.

1 should emphasize.- hero that

w© do not suggest or intimate that there it a rexjuiretrsnt to
pay tuition, though in fact Illinois dees under soma circum­
stances .
In this case the children involved, the appellants,
the named appellants, were attending free schools, supported
by State and federal moneys*
their basic subsistence grant.

All that is involved here is
X say all that is involved

hare, but obviously that grant covers their food, which they
need to eat, shelter, clothing, the real essentials of life,
aad it should not be gainsaid.
We differ slightly with the position of the other
appellants in this case ©a the statutory argument.

It is not

our position that the definition is mandatory in every
instance.

We recognise that Congress has, in certain instance.me
Vo.

indicated vary clearly and unmistakably — at least ir. my
judgment — that the program was intended to be optieraX rad
the States were to have a choice of either going into it or not

(r

going into it.
An example of that is involved in this case, and that
is the extension to the 18~tO“21-year"-oid group» was, in my
judgment, clearly optional? that the Senate report stated,
under existing law States# at their option, may continue payments
to needy children up to age 21 in the Aid to Families with
Dependent Children program.
Then it goes on# however;

"providing thsy are

regularly attending a high school in pursuance of a course; of
study leading to a high school diploma or its equivalent.''
The committee added an amendment, extending fchie
«n.

provision# referring to the. educational requirement provision,
so as to include needy children under 2,1 who are regularly
attending a school# college, or university.

In other words#

the program, which is optional, is the extension of AF.DC to
the age 18-tO“21-yeer-ald group; but the educational requirement
provision is different.

And that was instituted, according to

the report, which was deleted from the references by the
Solicitor General and the appellees in their brief, and is
included in our original brief and in our Reply Brief on page 9;
that the educational requirement provision and the extension of
college students was to bring- the educational, requirement, more
nearly in line with the provision .of the bill relating to the
continuation of a child's benefits under the OASDI system#
which is mandatory

16

Then it goes on;

"The objectives of the provision”

— that is the educational requirement provision in the
amendment to include, colleges

» "is to assure, ns far ms

possible, that children will not ba prevented from going to
school or college because they are deprived of parental
support.M
In the Solicitor General's brief? the Solicitor
General states that the Department *— referring to the Departeem
of Health? Education, and Welfare — believes that the amission
of college children from AFDC may have the unfortune
of perpetuating povertyi that in viewing tills statute, cat suvst
view it in terms of its purposes and in termo of its otructur© *
And we submit that under both standards it rec

This is the Old Age Survivors benefits,

That's not involved in this case at all?

MS. SPITZES;

The reason why 1 montion

that, and it's included in the Committee report and these
provisions were dona in tandem, that Congress evinced <?; clear
purpose to make the provisions as nearly alike

that the college requirements provision wies added to AFDC
because it was don© in OASDI, and they wanted to make the two
as nearly alike as possible.

And that'& the only•reason why l

Mention ito

No» it is not directly involved in this cm© now*

As soon as the bill was passed, .$nd completely in
line with the Solicitor General's statement it will have the
unfortunate effect of perpetuating poverty * and in line with she
Senate Report, the Department of Health, Mutation, and Welfare,
in its handbook, interpreted this, and they state that "Within.
•She age limit set by the State1* -— this is at page 5 of cur
brief — “Within the age limit set by the State, there should
be a choice of attending a school, college, or university or
taking a course of vocational or technical training for gainful
employment.
X think it is very, very important no recognise here
and the educational structure in Illinois is such that
vocational training, and one of the chief weapons used in order
to obtain vocational training for people are public community
colleges»

We have submitted as an Appendix to our brief the

college catalog for these junior colleges.

There are courses

sucii as air conditioning, inhalation therapy 5 these children
are being denied the right to attend these courses.
The entire role of vocational education in a State
is being moved into this area.
In terms of the question earlier, if Congress had
decided to cut it off at age 16, there clearly is no equal
protection violation involved.
18, there would not be.

If they had cut it off at age

But Congress hasn't dona that her©»

Congress has identified a group of people whom they

It defined

them and called them dependent children, sad provided financial

Illinois participates in the program, receives huge
amounts of federal money, and still attempts to exclude some
of those people that Congress v/anted to provido toon©fifes to.
We submit that this is wrong.

We submit that this frustrates

the purpose of Congress.
Q

You're saying that if the State wants to move

into that 18-to-21 category at all, it must support all those

20
MR. SPITZER*

Correct.

A® X read the equal protects.on clause , and as I read
aandridge, when one views classification made within fch© Stato,
they mast be rational, but they must also be rational within the
framework of the program in which the classification is mad©.
This ia particularly true in this case whore you have a total
exclusion of some children from a federally defined class.
We do not have the kind of case, as in Dandridge,
where everyone received some benefits.

And* the Court went out

of its way to point that out, it seens to me.

Whereas her©

do have this total exclusion, there is no doubt that the State
has a justifiable interest in protecting its fiscal integrity
and in conserving its AFDC resources.

We do not. challenge that

her© „
What we do challenge is whether they have chosen the
appropriate vehicle for so doing.

That is.? whether they can do

this by excluding children from the class, or whether they must
provide at least some benefit to ©veryone and simply reduce, if
they must, the level of benefits.
The Department of Health, Education, and welfare hass
taken ~~ argues that King does not require that the definition
of dependent children be read as a federal definition requiring
the States to participate wholly.

They argue that the terra

"parent" in King was in some way essential to the purposes of
fch© Act, and that there was a clear congressional intent to .

21
.include all those children with an absent parent, and th© State
could not define '’parent" in a way contrary to the Social
Security Act, which, in its legislative history, maant legally
obligated to support.
And in Lewis vs. Martin, there war a man assuming the
role of a spouse, actually living in til© house, there was none
of the fiction involved in Kino, of a casual sexual liaison
whatever.

?

Her® we actually had a man in tie house, living

there, and assumed the role of a spouna.

3ut the Court said

that children, where a man lives there, cannot be totally
excluded from the program.
It seems to ma that that requires this Court to say
■that the definition was mandatory, that it'e been held to be
mandatory«
In Dandrldge the Court suggested that the definition
was fixed by federal law.

And if it's fixed by federal law,

then the State can haw absolutely no right whatsoever to,
exclude some of those needy children from the program.
The doctrine of equitable treatment, which is advanced
by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to explain
:.<ing creates a total anomaly.

They have devised a standard

without — they have devised a doctrina without standard.

The

cases which they have taken positions on cannot be squared,
in my judgment*

King was required; Lewis was required.

In

Arison® were otherwise eligible children living with relatives,

22

not having legal custody over the child, a:id where the child
had a sibling living with ha..a natural parent»,
fro® the Act»

exelfcdod

In these cases, the Departeint nt

Education, and Welfare concedes that the 8tatos went astray'

.and they have violated the federal definition and have Improperly
excluded needy children from that definition.
But in the educational requirement, which tan Senate
Report indicates clearly, in ray judgment,

It was; intended to

provide benefits to college children, to laifce aura that aoac.y
children, deprived of a parent, were not denied the right to an
education in college, at least where the State gees into the
18-to~21-year-old

’©gram.

hud. it

was far as possible"? that tiros© children :an he excluded.
That in Carter vs♦ Stanton, which will toe heard nmtt by this
Court, they interpreted ‘’continuous absence" as being optional
with the State, and that where* a parent has deserted or bears
separated from the house for less than six months the States is

ORAL ARGUMENT OP DONALD J. V3SV3LKA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR, VEVERKA?

Mr. Chief Justice,

i-.:x&

may it plenae

the Court;
1 would like to first point out that, although AFBC
benefits were cut off at the time that these children attended

a college or university, that they war® provided with gcne-rtl
assistance funds.
2 believe the issue before this Court —
Q

That was wholly a State program?

MR. VEVERKA: That's true, Your Honor.
Q

The general assistance fund,

MR. VEVERKA:

I believe the issue before this Court

is whether the equal protection clause or the supremacy clausa
requires the State to participata fully in the federal AFDC
program regardless of their financial condition,

I think thi?.

is contrary to the congressional intent, which provided that
the programs would be implemented, or that financial assistance
would be provided as far as practicable under the conditions in

aach State.
I think it's somewhat important to note that Illinois*
involvement in this case 1b not because it has «rut grants > as

a matter of fact, Illinois provide® 100 percent of need? or
not because it’s established any strange eligibility require­
ments* but simply because it adopted a classification which was

27
originally established by Ccngreee in 1964,
Prior to 1964 the federal definition of a dependentchild was a child under 18.

In 1964 Congress amended the

definition end it defined a dependant child as someone undrr
the ag© of 18 or someone under the aga of 21 who was attending
a high school which would lead — a high school course? of study
which would lead to a diploma# or a vocational training p-chool
which would lead to gainful employment.
Now# at the time that Congress amended its definition
of a dependent child, Illinois similarly $:wn&a& its Public aid
Cod© to provide essentially the same definition.

And in 1965,

on© year later, Congress again expanded fcho definition, but
unfortunately the financial conditions in the State of Illinois
and in nine other States have not allowed it to expand the
definition.
The Congress has consistently, sines 1940# recognised
that a State does not have to expand its benefits every time
that Congress expands its definition of a dependent child*

For

example # in 1940, the age limit vms 16# and Congress raised the
age limit of a dependent child from 16 to 10' # and afc that time
the House report stated:

It is estimated that about 100,000

additional children may obtain the aid by virtu© of this change#
■provided all States amend their laws accordingly.
This iis set forth in our brief on page 36,
Q

Well# you wouldn't think that if Congress could

2S
— or that the State could, say, givo support payments to just
half of the children under 16?

You wouldn't think just in

tamis of being able to limit the State's investment, that “we'll
take every other child and giv© him .--.supportB?
MR, VEVERKAs

Q

No; that's true, Ysur Honor.

Well, if Congress says, '"Here ar© matching funds

to provide education for students over 13 in vocational -icti^olz
or collegas” and the state says, "Well, we 'll’* *— you wouldn't
think they could just say, "Half those students in the-?.®
categories we'll support, and the other half we won’t'5?
MR® VEVERKAs

X think, Your Honor, that if a State

adopts a classification established by Congress, that it has
the right, and Congress, I think, has expressly recognised the
fact that it has the right to take the same steps as are
established by congress.

I think that if it adopts the same

requirements that Congress adopts, it is acting rationally,
and again I think that the test is rationality.
Now, from time to time when Congress has expanded the
definition of what is a dependent, child

for example, my

recollection is that when they expanded it from 16 to 18 there
was a requirement that they be in school.

So the point there

is that Congress has taken this step, has taken this approach
throughout the time that it*» expanded the definition, from
time to time as it expanded -**
G

Well, I understand that.

MR. VSVSRKA: And then a year later it was expanded t

So a© it now stands, the definition is- stud-arts

in vocational schools or colleges?
MR* VSVERKAs That’s true, Your Hoi:-or.
Q

And that’s the congressionaL category that the

Act defines.
MR. VEVERKAs

That’s true, Your .Honor.

But, at tho

same time that they did that, and at all times that they have
expanded that definition, they’ve made it clear that e 3tat©
can expand it if the financial conditions, or as far as is
practical under the laws of fcha State,
I believe that a State can take that approach as
long as there’s a rational distinction. And 1 believe that
th®r© is a rational distinction here betwean the classifica­
tion which Congress originally sat up in 1.954 and the classifi
cation which they later adopted in 1965.
Now, referring to the time that —

fact that not all —

MR, VSVERKA*

Or is Illinois .different?

I belie'v© you do get a diploma, Your

Honor*
Q

Well, why do you draw th© difference?

You say

one you get a diploma, and the other you get a job,
MR. VEVERKA: Well, 2 draw that distinction because
of th© fact that normally you speak of a diploma in

of

a formal type education as opposed to vocational or technic?!

You do get a diploma of some kind,
Q

Well, do you think there’s a difference between

MR. VEVERKA:

No, 1 don't believe so, Your Honor.

what you want?

No, Your Honor.

Mo, Your Honor.

I think fch&fc it's t,

2 think that the fact that Congress picked up the

category in the first place in 1964, and the imy in which lhay
did it, 2 think that it was a realisation that there are some
who are not interested in a high school course of action in
formal education, as vm know it —
Q

Well, let me ask fchiss

does a child in vocational

school eat less food than, a child in a high school?

Don’t they

©at the same food?
MR. VEVEEKAs That’s true, Your Honor.
Q

Don’t they wear th© same clothes?

MR. VEVEEKAs
Q

That's true, Your Honor.

And don’t they have the same needs?

Exact

same needs,
MR. VEVERK&i That's true, Your Honor.

A child in a

vocational and technical, school and © child in high school, and
that’s exactly my point.
Q

Well, a child in college has the same problem.

Why does it change so suddenly?
MR. VEVERKAs
Q

Your Honor, it changes because --

Is it your theory that a poor child just doesn’t

need a college education?

MR. VEVTBRKAj

No, that’s not fcrun, Your Honor.

The

point; that: 1 make is that if the State of Illinois had a hundred
dollars to give to someone, and it had to take its choice be­

MS. VBWERK&s

Your Honor, but the difference is they

have the same need, but the State of Illinois has filled' them
in different ways.

The fact is that v/htn somebody graduates

from high school and gets a high school diploma and enters a
junior college or a collogo, he then is eligible, as opposed to
s child in vocational ax technical school, .ha is then
eligible to get tuition-in-grants.

A child who is in a technice

or vocational school has the same needs, but he is not eligible,
because in most cases he does act haw & high school diploma.

I attempted to find out.
Q

You mean to pay for clothes?

I don’t fciiov?.

That’s Mr. Justice Marshall*® question.

MR. VEVERKAs Slight.

I understand that.

But, a® a practical matter» if a child is in a
technical or vocational school, and he's expected to pay
tuition, for example, which may b© $350 or $5*00, as a practical
matter he is in approximately the same position a® somebody
who is attending a college, who is getting a grant to cover
expenses at a college,but is not getting the living expanses.
We have provided — the State of Illinois has provided aid in
two different areas, but essentially they have equalised the
conditions.
The point that I'm attempting to make is that if ths;
State of Illinois had a hundred dollars to give, and it had a
choice between an 8-year-old child and a 20-year-eld child,
now, both of them could fall within the technical definition
of what is a needy child, in the gens# that they are. making
less than the standard of need.

But the fact, remains that if

vs© assume that Illinois has on© hundred dollars and it chooses

3S
to give it to the 8-y©ar~old, X. don‘1; think it could be said to
ba arbitrary that it chose to give that hundred dollars to the
8-year-old m opposed to the 20-year-old.
The point being that ©van among those who era
technically classified as needy, there are some who are urra in
need of help than others.

The point is that here those who are

in technical or vocational school» although they are t-scheica/.ly
4-iO needy as somebody who is in a college or university*, thrur
children are still less in need of. Ho. 1* because it's more
•

•

)

likely than not* the kid in the technical or vocational school
do©s not have a high school degree; which means that he has
no choice.

H© can’t get into a collega or university, he can

only get into a technical school.
Secondly, he’s not in as much netsd because of the fact
that when he gets that high school degree* and when ho gets
into a college or university# he is then available for then©
tuitions -- which of course wouldn’t apply in the case of &
junior college

and the grants and the guaranteed loans.

And ©specially the grants.

So, as a matter of fact, the child

who is in a technical or vocational «school, educationally, under
most States, is at a distinct disadvantage because of the fact
that he cannot get the came assistance.
Again, the point is that a child —* that high school
degree does mark the difference between a child who is more in
need of help than the other child.

Again X*d like to get back to tins fact that in 1965,
now, when Congress established anti expanded the definition,
at that tires it pointed out — and tills is contained on pages
36 and 3? of our brief

that under existing law States, at

■their option, may continue payment.
committee report went on to says

And then the Senatorial

Federal sharing for this

purpose would thus ha available to State» who implement ouoh a
program for payments to children regularly attending a collage
or university* as wall as those attending ligh school or
vocational school.
But Congress has made it clear that the Statos can,
•as finances allow, develop the program, m long as there is a
rational choice.

And again X believa that there is a. rational

choica.
And Counsel was candid enough to admit that w© are
talking about not only post-high school education but alec
the equivalent.

At the time that Congress originally established

this classification, if you examine the classification, that they
set up, they spoke in terras of someone who is attending a high
school in a course of study which was — which would load to a
degree, or vocational or -technical school which would lead to
gainful employment.
X think the point -there in that Congress at this time
realised the fact that not everyone that fcha State was concerned
with, or not everyone that Congress was concerned about was

38
somebody who would want to go back to high cchock, and. gat o
degree.

I think it was concerned about che kid who drops out

of high school and finds; that h© hat?, no aptitude .for wort ana
desires, instead,-, to go to vocational or technical school.
So I think that we’re not talking about the same class of kids.
I think that the principles that this Court has ©nuncieted on
a number of occasions, that a State can attack as much of a
problem as its finances allow.
Now, no discussion would bo complete without a pictura
of'the situation in Illinois, as it exists now.

Because of a

substantial increase, a fivefold increase in the hPDC cates,
Governor Ogilvie announced there's $.108 million over-all
deficit in the welfare programs, and specifically $107 million
deficit in State funds.
Now, the Governor was faced with either cutting
grants, and in the report which he submitted in October of *71
he spoke in terms of one-third cut in the .-standard of need, as
opposed to 100 percent? given-. 100 percent standard of need
that would mean roughly 67 or 70 percent standard of need.
In an attempt to alleviate this problem, whet he did was h©
transferred funds from the general assistance funds —
general assistance fund, which is purely a State program — lute
your AFDC, he transferred $21 million, and this then met the
AFDC budget.
Now, litigation resulted, and as of this time the

Governor has bean, enjoined fresa carrying out. this program.

But the point is that at this time there is «.
possibility of cutting the standard of need in AFDC cmez»

We

do not believe that th© Constitution requires fchs State of
Illinois to take the money, assuming that thtei is the conditionf
we do not believe that the Constitution requires the Scats of
Illinois- to take money from the 8-year-old and the 9-y&ar~old
and the 10-y©ar~old and give, it to a 20-year-old basketball
player.
We believe that vr© have helped those that were mast
in need under Illinois low, namely those without the high
school degree, those who, say in a period of a short time,
could become employable where they weren't employable before.
We believe that the State of Illinois has acted rationally.

program?
MR» VEVERKA*

It depends on the courses in the

Appendix, which I've set forth in my brief»

I took the Chicago

area vocational schools and I listed the courses and the length
of time.

In addition to that, 7 have cited in my brief the

report of the

it was a House Committee on Education * and

they found that the — it was a Republican Task Force on
Education, and they found that the average length of a
vocational school was approximately four months to a year.
Which is another point.
If somebody attends a junior college, we*re talking
essentially about a. two-year program.

And again ore thing I'd

like to mention that the classification which fcfco plaintif £
sought to — which the plaintiffs represent is not the two-year
college student but, rather, the four-year collega student.
This is the classification which they established in their
n«s, and this, I believe.

tho lUsstra before this

Court.
Both of the plaintiffs indicated a course of study
which would hav© required a period of time far in excess of the

41
two years.
Omega Minor will finish in about fivo mvJ n half
years, and the other plaintiff indicated t'lat ha intended to
go on for a period of four years..
So, again, fcho point is here that in & technical or
vocational school, not only is it zaoro lilcaly than not if. -it
you have someone who does not have a high school degra-e and
therefor© is more in need of help, but you also have

aitn-ttir*

where the State can provide &FDC benefits for a period of
perhaps four months to a year and b© assured that at the ©ad
of that time that there is some chance that the recipient will
no longer need the help of th® State.
But going on to the point again, Congress has sold,
every time that it's amended the Act. that the States are fro©
to either expand the definition or not expand tha definition.
HEW has defined, or has mad® similar statements.

They've set

forth their views in a regulation which is cited in our brief,
and in that regulation they have said that a State is free to
— they have said specifically, in our brief on page 39, that
although the public assistance titles define th© -coverage in
which the Federal Government will participate financially, a
State may provide coverage on a broader or more limited basis.
And in light of the views «axpreesed by HEW. and by
Congress, we believe that the plaintiffs are asking for relief
which both Congress and

hew

has thus far refused to grant.

42
Nov;, for this Court; to grant it is extended covrrage
would bo contrary to the principles that it

!'&

enunciated on a

number of occasions, -dial; in a statutory construction case its'
function is not to — not to implement its cvm vi-vws, but,
rather, to carry out the will of Congress.

And Congrosr has

manifested its will, that tile states are free to do this *
Furthermore, I would point out that Congress cam grant
the relief which the plaintiffs are soaking by passing the
Family Assistance Act*
Now, the difference between this Court granting the
relief sought by the plaintiffs and Congress achieving the sc:or
result is that. under the Family Assistance Plan, if this Is
don®, if aid is extended to those in colleges or universities
as well

those in technical or vocational schools, under the.

m

Act as it stands now the Federal Government; would provide
additional funds, other than what it now provides.

Of course

it now provides funds on a £50/50 basis;undor apportion in that
Family Assistance Act, it would fund ICO percent as opposed to
50 percent.
I believe that this is a realisation by Congress that
not »11 of the States car, fully implement the Act, and that if
Congress wants the uniform system of welfare across the entire
nation, that it will have to provide additional benefits„
In conclusion, I would like to say that this Court
recognised in Dandrlcge that promoting employability end saving

funds wer© legitimate State- ends.
