PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments in

No. 5040, Mayer against the City of Chicago.
Mr. Field.
ORAL ARGUMENT CF HENRY F. FIELD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. FIELD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
This case raises once again the issue first, raised
and decided by this Court 15 years ago in Griffin vs. 111inois,
of whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires that a State, which
provides appeals of right and reporters who transcribe trials,
provide a poor person, who is unable to pay for,that trans­
cript, aid who needs that transcript to demonstrate crucial
trial errors, so that he may have an adequate and effective
review and may adequately exercise his right of appeal.
This case today arises under Illinois Supreme Court
Rule

6)7 which, at the time of trial and until very recently,

provide! that only defendants in felony cases had — indigent
defends its had a right to apply for free transcript from the
State of Illinois.
As of July 1st of this year, that rule has been
amended so that it now provides that any defendant who, at the
time of trial, faced a penalty greater than six months in
jail, could apply to Illinois for a transcript.

4
Q

Would that new rule have reached this case?

MR. FIELD%
Q

Would the nev; rule apply to this case?

MR. FIELD:
Q

Pardon me?

No, Your Honor, it did not.

No, I said would it?

MR. FIELD:

No, I don't believe it affects the case

in any way.
Q

What was the possible penalty?

MR. FIELD:

Here the possible penalty, at the time of

trial, was $1,000 fine and no jail term, at least initially.
Q

Well, I'm not sure I follow what that means,

"initiilly".
MR. FIELD:
Q

Illinois does —

That means if he didn't pay the fine?

MR. FIELD:
Q

Well,

Yes.

And how much of a jail term?

MR. FIELD:

Illinois provides that a defendant has

to pay off or work off a fine at $5 a day, and that's the
contingency in the case which leaves a possible jail sentence.
But afl er this Court's decision in Tate vs. Short of last year,
this qiestion is perhaps removed from the case, although there's
still some uncertainty, I believe, as to the construction of
that ci se.
Q

Well, would it be removed from the case

automatically, or would just the $5 a day be under question?

5

MRe FIELD:

Well, the effect of Tate vs. Short,

were it applied to this case, would be, as I understand the
case, that the defendant here could not be put in jail at the
rate of $5 a day, if he did not — was not able to pay the
fine that h€* was sentenced to.
Q

So the new rule doesn’t reach anything measured

by the amount of the fine?
MR. FIELD:
Q

No.

Only if the fine is not —

MR. FIELD:

Only if the defendant, at the time of

trial, faced a penalty of greater than six months in jail, and
does not include the contingency of six months worked off
through fines.
Q

You are suggesting we keep this case to the

so-called petty advantage, rather than one that might have
more than a six-months jail sentence?
MR. FIELD:

I don't believe that even at the $5 rate

this defendant would be in jail for more than six months.

So

that point would not be raised.
Q

Would not?

MR. FIELD:
Q
wouldn't it?

Yes.

From the $5 rate that would be 200 days,
If my arithmetic is correct.

MR. FIELD:

He was sentenced at trial to $500 fine.

He face 3 a thousand but was sentenced to 500; and I believe

6

that he could not be put in jail then, at the Illinois rate,
for more than 100 days.
I won't belabor the Court with any kind of discussion
or lengthy discussion of the rule of law in this case.

You all

are familiar with Griffin, that established the principle that
destitute defendants must be afforded as adequate appellate
review as persons who can afford transcripts.
Just last year, in Williams vs. Oklahoma City, this
Court decided a drunk driving case, where the defendant faced
90 days in jail, and in a unanimous per curiam opinion had no
trouble applying Griffin to the facts.
Rule 607 of the Illinois Supreme Court ~
Q

Mr. Field, where is Mr. — is it Dr. Mayer,

where is he now?
MR. FIELD:

He is now in California.

I am not

fully possessed of his circumstances, but he has moved from
Mew York, where he originally was.
Q

I am just curious, is he practicing medicine now?

MR. FIELD:

I prefer not to make representations

about his current status, because I really am not too fully
in forme 3.

The .record has nothing in it concerning his present

circumstances, and I haven't made myself too aware of them.
Q

Do you know whether he is indigent today?

MR. FIELD:

It’s my belief that h© is, Your Honor,

indigent today, yes, sir.

7
Q

Etch though he has an M.D. degree?

MR. FIELD;

Yes, he has — I do have some information

concerning him, and that information, to my knowledge, has not
.changed his indigency status? he still cannot pay for the
transcript.

He is not living at anything above necessaries.

But, as I want to emphasize, I am not fully informed
on that fact, on that point.
Q

Well, I suppose there were apt to be trials in

connection with the petition here?
MR. FIELD;

Yes.

For indigency.

The ~ after the trial, the

petitioner filed an affidavit, and there was a full hearing on
this question of his indigency, where the City was represented
and attacked it, and the acting chief judge of the Circuit
Court cf Cook County found that he was indeed indigent and
unable to pay for the $300 transcript.
Q

I suppose you got leave to proceed her© as a

pauper?
MR. FIELD;

Yes.

Rule 607 of the Illinois Supreme Court wholly denies
a transcript to this appellant, who faced $1,000 fine, and,
regardless of his need for it, and he needs that transcript, as
I will demonstrate, in order to raise the really central
point of his trial.
And Rule 607 also wholly denies an opportunity to all
indigene persons to show, to demonstrate to Illinois that they

8

need a transcript in order to raise points at evidence and
possibly unconstitutional conduct of their trials»

And it

completely insulates trials of indigents from review in cases
involving less than six months in jail.
It's appellant's contention that this blanket
prohibition of all indigent now under six months, six months
and under, appeals, and violates the Fourteenth Amendment in
several respects.
First, Illinois has chosen to draw an invidious line
between rich and poor, in violation of this Court's clear
mandate in Griffin, and Williams, and many cases elaborating
those principles.
Secondly, it hides and insulates from any appellate
correction unconstitutional errors, in this case a denial of a
fair trial.
The facts of the case,necessarily skimpy, can be
brie fly stated.
Q

Mr. Field, before you go on, I'm not sure how

important this is, but I'm a little surprised that you seem to
think that the present status of the petitioner, his financial
status, is not relevant, and that it must stand on his status
at the ;im@ the case arose.

What if, hypothetically, he had

inherited a million dollars between now and then?
using a demonstrative rule, I'm just demonstrating.
MR. FIELD:

Well, that's of course

I am not

9

Q

Would fchafc not have something to do with

whether this Court should be devoting its time to the case on
the grounds of indigency?
MR. FIELD;

That could be true/ Your Honor.

That's

not, of course, this situation.
Q

Well, maybe it isn't, but wouldn't it be rather

remarkable to think of a young man, a relatively young man, who
has a degree of Doctor of Medicine, today in the United States
being indigent?
MR. FIELD;

Well, it's my understanding that he had

tremendous debts and that —• I just feel very strongly that
this case has gone through the full hearing of indigency and
that his situation basically hasn't changed.

And I know

nothing that would change that, and would raise the —
Q

Well, I don't mean to.suggest that we would hold

you to knowing at the present instant his financial situation;
I don't mean that at all.
MR. FIELD;
Q

If the Court would please —

Do I understand you to be suggesting that that

situation is irrelevant to this case?
MR. FIELD;

Well, were he a millionaire, I could

conceive how it could be irrelevant, because of the method
that Illinois .has chosen to completely deny transcripts to
indigen s in non-six-months cases.
Q

Well, would we be concerned about what they're

10

doing in other cases, or are we to deal with what they're doing
in this case?
MR. FIELD; Well, I think this case is of course
important, and it's — his ability to pay now might indeed
change to the Court the whole posture on the situation.
However, this Court has a record before it, i^hich 1 believe is
completa.

If Illinois can frustrate this Court's enforcement

of the Fourteenth Amendment by, as it has in this case,
forcing defendants to appeal and, because time is always money,
raise in any indigent case a question as to his ability to pay
for a transcript.
Q

Well, I understood the last affidavit — that's

the one, isn't it, at page 26 — that apparently was sworn to
on the 3rd day of February 1970, at that time he was — I
don't understand that he was a physician but a medical student.
MR. FIELD:
Q

That's true.

Well, is he now a physician or a student?

MR. FIELD:
what a physician is.

Frankly, Your Honor, I'm not certain
He has, it's my tinderstanding, graduated

from school.
Q

He has graduated from medical school?

MR. FIELD:
Q

From school.

And he's —*

Since 1970, well, I suppose he'd have an

internsnip to serve.
MR. FIELD:

Well, this -- I believe it was this

II
summer, and he's been working in a hospital for several months
Q

Internship.

Q

As an intern?

MR. FIELDs
Q

Yes, I suppose that's correct.

Do you know what interns are paid these days?

MR. FIELD;

I don't know what he's getting, I have

no knowledge of that.
Q

Do you know what interns are paid these days?

MR. FIELD;

No.

He has only been working very, very

briefly.
Basically, what happened x^as that tills defendant was
a participant as a medical presence while he was in medical
school, a first-aid assistant at the scene of a demonstration
in Chicago, march and rally, which was sponsored by SDS and
various other antiwar, at that time, groups.

And he came

upon an injured victim, and interacted with the police under
circumstances which were the subject of a two-day jury trial.
Q

You say he interacted, what do you mean?

that a juphonism for what?

Or is

What did he think was going to

happen?
MR. FIELD;

Well, that, of course, is the transcript

which is not present in the case.
Q

And what happened —

What was he charged with?

MR. FIELD;
municipal offenses.

He was charged with two City of Chicago

12

Q

Like what?

MR. FIELD:

Disorderly conduct and interfering with

the police.
Q

All right.

MR. FIELD:

And he was sentenced to $500, and I

represented this defendant at trial.
Q

$500 fine and

MR. FIELD:

After the trial —

no imprisonment?

No jail.

No jail was possible, except

as we have discussed, contingently.
Q

Right.

MR. FIELD:

Right.
After the trial h® filed a post-trial

motion which raised several substantial contentions attacking
the legitimacy of the verdict, and the judgment in the case.
His basic point was that he was convicted on
insufficient evidence, compounded of grossly prejudicial
prosecutorial misconduct, which denied him a fair trial.
And the emulative effect was to override, wholly override the
evidence in the case.
As is stated in the affidavit of counsel, in the post
trial motion and the motion in the Illinois Supreme Court, it
was our feeling that the defendant, was convicted not for what
he did but for the sins of SDS and for wholly unrelated but
contemps raneous injury to one Richard Elrod, who vaulted -~
who had bean an obscure city lawyer in the prosecutor's office,
who vaulted into the front page of Chicago papers all during

13

the preliminary portion of this trial, and the time between his
arrest and trial, and proceeded from the front pages of the
Chicago papers to elective office.

He's now Sheriff of Cook

County»
After this motion was denied, and we learned the cost
of the transcript was well beyond his means, we moved in the
Circuit Court of Cook County for three things:

appointment

of counsel; production of a transcript; and the waiver of
filing fees.
After lengthy hearing, the court found that he was
indigent and unable to pay, but refused to grant him access to
the transcript, on the ground that Rule 607 applies only to
felony cases.

The order reads:

"Order, that the motion of the defendant for leave
to proceed as a poor person be and is hereby denied on the
grounds that defendant was found guilty of ordinance
violations and that Rule 607 of the Supreme Court applies to
felony cases."
We renewed the motion in the Illinois Supreme Court,
and urced the unconstitutionality of the approach taken by
Illinois in Rule 607.

The motion, after due consideration,

for counsel and transcript was denied and filing fees were
waived.
Q

Mr. Field, does the rule provide any alternative

methods: of reporting proceedings?

14
MR. FIELDs

Yes, that is provided in other sections

of the Illinois Supreme Court rules, and there are two basic
methods for proceeding.

The first method is to get an agreed

statement, and the second method is to get a — if you can't
agree -— to get a settled statement.

Agree with the prosecution

as opposed to the court.
Q

Was either method pursued by him?

MR. FIELD:

Neither method was pursued in this case,

and the reason goes to the heart of the contention here.

It’s

the position of the defendant, the appellant her®, that very
clearly, on the face of his contentions, neither alternatives
are adequate.

Neither alternative is adequate.

The two contentions, on® of insufficiency of evidence
and ones of grossly prejudicial misconduct, both require the
kind of detailed survey of the facts of the case, the words
used,

.he questions posed, the answers and responses, which

only a transcript could provide and which no one connected
with the case, having total recall, could possibly reconstruct.
Q

How long did the case take to try?

MR. FIELD:
days.

My best recollection is that it was two

But there was possibly some spillover to a third day

for -Q

Will you suggest a hypothesis as to how appeals

were f; irly conducted years ago when there was no reporter
and there was no transcript, but the bill of exceptions, or

15

by whatever name it was called, the claims of error ware
reproduced for the appellate court by counsel, relying on their
recollection, with or without total recall?
MR. FIELD: Well, there would be no way to adequately
present an appeal on these contentions in that circumstance.
Q

You mean for 150 years we were, in this country,

processing all appeals inadequately, including appeals for
rich men?
MR. FIELD:

Well, if there were scribes at trial,

or the people helping attorneys who could take down the
detailed testimony, that could have not been true; but in
this case the problem was that he was poor and he had only his
counsel and ~
Q

Are you representing that in a two-day a trained

lawyer cannot reproduce — two trained lawyers cannot repro­
duce the substance and the essence of the testimony that was
given in the trial?
MR. FIELD:
cases.

Is that your suggestion?
That may be possible.

I think in most

But that certainly is not the case here, because of

the nat ore —
Q

Did you do it?

Did you take notes?

Careful

notes.
MR. FIELD:

No, I didn't take careful notes, I took

some nc;es; but I was conducting the cross-examination and I
knew that the transcript was — I mean a reporter was present,

*

16

and —
Q

Did you have an associate with you?

MR. FIELD:

No, there was no one else on the case.

I think that the nature of the contentions is the key
to why that transcript is required in this case.

Because the

police -— the contention on the insufficiency of evidence was
that —• is that the police, some certain police testimony which
— the purport of which was to show this man, the defendant, to
be a violent man was inherently incredible, and was demonstrated
to be such by other testimony at the trial.

And by the

cross-examination, by myself, lengthy cross-examination of the
police witnesses.
Q

Well, do you represent that the day after, or the

week afzer, you could not sit down, yourself, and make a
synopsi3 of the testimony of each witness at that trial?
MR. FIELD:

That's absolutely true as to these

two contentions, Your Honor.
Q

You could not do it?

MR. FIELD:
much of the testimony.

I could do — I could make a synopsis of
There's no doubt that I can recall a

great deal that went on, but there's no way that I can recall
the kind of detailed questioning and the words used, the precise
words used, that go to show the nature of the prejudicial
attack >£ the prosecutor, and his intensive, systematic
effort ;o hang this defendant, not for the facts of what

17

happened with his interaction with the police, but for wholly
unrelated matters, and sins of others, and the injury to Mr.
Richard Elrod, which was really-the pripae focus of the
prosecution.
I believe that I can show that with a transcript.
I could show that the first witness in the case was put on
solely for the reason of interjecting into this trial the
name well known to everyone, of Richard Elrod.
Q

Who is Richard Elrod?

MR. FIELDs

Richard Elrod is now the Sheriff of Cook

County.
Q

Oh, yes.

MR. FIELD:

At the time of the incident here, out of

which this case arises, he was an obscure city lawyer in the
Corporation Counsel's office, a prosecutor for the City of
Chicago.

But he was — this appears in the affidavit, these

facts appear in the affidavit of counsel in the brief, at 12.
He vaulted from obscurity into the front pages and
into el»ctive office on the basis of his injury which occurred
during ;h@ same antiwar demonstration.
Two rules of Illinois lav/ also combine to make
overwhelming the impossibility of this defendant reconstructing
the nature, the words used, the inadequate or minimally
adequate factual predicate for presenting these two contentions.
First of all, under Illinois law, the defendant, if

18

there ia any disagreement as to the facts, must prove his
version of the facts at a hearing on the facts, tinder Illinois
Supreme Court Rule 323, I believe, which is the settled
statement rule.

And in this situation there is no way that I

could, ?r anyone could prove the detailed and intensive
prejudicial conduct of the prosecutor, the words used.

How

could I prove, how could anyone prove something they cannot
recall?
The second rule of law, creating a hurdle to an
adequate review, an adequate alternative, is that the appellate
courts 3f Illinois presume the facts against the defendant if
an adequate record is not provided with which to support the
contentions on appeal.

And there is no way that this defendant

can create a minimally adequate factual predicate for these
two contentions.

He could create, through a settled or

agreed statement, many other facts in the case, but there is
no way for him to —
Q

Do I understand that you are not arguing that

if it ware possible to pursue one of these alternative
methods — if it ware; you say it was not ■— but if it were,
you don’t argue that nevertheless constitutionally you are
entitled to a copy of the transcript, do you?
f5R. FIELD;

No, I don't argue that, Your Honor, in

■this case.
Q

Well, what have we to dc with the fact, as I

19
understand it, that you do not pursue, made no attempt to
pursue one of the alternative methods?
MR. FIELD:

That point is made by the State’s

attorney in the capacity as amicus, and I think that the
answer to that has to be a clear recognition that, based on
the affidavit and other facts of record,
Q

That the affidavits make out a case —

MR. FIELD:
Q

They make out a very clear case.

— which precludes you from attempting either

of the alternative methods?
MR. FIELD:
Q

They show, or they demonstrate —

Well, is that your position?

MR. FIELD:
the words slightly.

That is my position.

I would change

They demonstrate that it's impossible for

— it was impossible for this defendant to proceed without
being caught in a bind of either submitting a settled or
agreed statement, v/hich he knew to be wholly inadequate,
which couldn’t start to create the minimum factual predicate
for these two points.
And if it's agreed upon, if the prosecutor and if I
were the prosecutor I would think it very smart to agree to
the statement, knowing full well that it's inadequate.

Or if

he meets the burden —
Q
tried to do it?

How can you say it's inadequate if you never

20

MR. FIELD:

Well, I have to — the counsel and the

defendant have to create the factual statement, and there's no
way, without total recall, that I can demonstrate and create a
factual record on these two points.

They require close

attention to the words used and the questions posed, on crossexamination and on direct examination,
Q

Well, were you pressed to say in the Illinois

court why it was you had not pursued the alternative method?
MR. FIELD:
Q

Were you pressed in the Supreme Court —

MR. FIELD:
Q

Pardon me, Mr. Justice Brennan?

No.

Where did you go besides the Supreme Court?

Only to the Supremo Court of Illinois?
MR. FIELD:

Well, we had the hearing and the denial

in the circuit court and then in the Supreme Court.
Q

Well, didn't you argue in the federal court that

you had to have a transcript because the alternative methods
would be inadequate?
MR. FIELD:

I don't have a transcript of that, I

frankly have forgotten what I argued, but I was totally
foreclosed from seeking a transcript because of the judge's
legal ruling that I could not, regardless of my need for it
and the nature of the contentions raised, get one -under Rule
607.

Q

Because the rule did not apply in this case?

21

MR. FIELD?

Because the rule applied only to felony

cases,
Q

Well, now, what — did you argue this orally in

the Supreme Court?
MR. FIELD;
Q

Wo.

This was submitted on papers.

And what you submitted, did it make any effort

to say why it is you had to have the transcript rather than
use an alternative method?
MR. FIELD:

Yes.

In the Supreme Court, this was

the Illinois Supreme Court, this was fully briefed, this point,
and demonstrated why —
Q

And the matter of the alternatives was fully

briefed?
MR. FIELD:

Oh, yes.

This was — and in fact the

excerpt from the affidavit of counsel appears in the brief as
to why .it's impossible.
Q

Would you say that your presentation to the

Supreme Court of Illinois was substantially the presentation
which you have made to us here?
MR. FIELD;

I. believe so, Your Honor.

That the course of trial as to the prejudicial con­
duct of the prosecution, which denied him a fair trial; the
course of trial was — has to be examined.

Illinois requires

that in order to judge the impact of a prejudicial conduct, or
remarks, you must survey the whole record.

There is no way

22
that I could, or anyone could reconstruct the record.

Although

they could, as you point out, reconstruct many things in the
record, there is no way that he can reconstruct this point,
and the point of insufficiency of evidence inherent in
credibility of certain police testimony, which would permit him
to be acquitted on appeal.
Q

Mr. Field, how far do you carry your argument?

Would you take it down to any kind of a proceeding, including
the traffic offense?
MR. FIELD:

I think that Williams vs. Oklahoma City

indicatas that wherever an appeal is granted to all defendants,
that the appeal may not be denied, in effect, to poor
defendants because of their inability to buy a transcript.
Now, of course, your hypothetical doesn't — isn't
this case.
Q

No, but I'm asking you because this is what we

have tc struggle with.
MR. FIELD:
Q

Yes, I realize that.

I'm asking you where you draw the line, if you

draw any line.
MR. FIELD:

Yes.

I think that you have to examine

the reel life impact on the defendant in a particular case,
and at some point -— the point your question raises is that
at some point certain offenses are so trivial and unimportant
that even the Fourteenth Amendment should not be applied to

23
require a transcript.

And I wouldn't be able to say,

hypothetically, without an examination of a real case, and I
would want to sit on that case and listen to the -Q

Well, would it draw it between offenses for

which imprisonment is possible and those for which it is not?
I take it you wouldn’t draw it there.
MR. FIELD:

Wo, I definitely v/ould not, Your Honor.

I think that this case demonstrates the crudity and injustice
of that rule, that is, it —Q

Well, would you draw it between a monetary

figure above $50 or below $50?
MR. FIELD:
of the detriment.

I think that I would look at the realities

That is, if it's a fishing license case, to

take a hypothetical, it might well foe that a fishing license
— fishing without a license in a certain area of the world
is the next most heinous sin to murder, and in that situation
1 would think that a transcript v/ould be required, although a
small fin© perhaps was involved.
I would look at the particular impact on the
particular defendant in the cases that arise.
Q

Mr, Field, isn't it true that the courts just

don't fcrve the time?
MR. FIELD:
Q

Do you agree?
Yes.

Do you have reporters in Illinois?

MR. FIELD:

Yes

24
Q

But ycm do acknowledge that it’s difficult?

MR» FIELD;

Yes.

The appendix to the Reply Brief

does have a brief synopsis of what I believe to be the situation
v/ith regard to reporting of trials generally,
Q

But it8s not throughout the country,, that's ray

problem„
MR, FIELD:

Yes, I know.

Throughout the country,

at least in the States that we surveyed, it’s my understanding
that in many jurisdictions there are no — there is no
stenographically transcribed ~~
Q

That’s what I mean.

MR. FIELD:

— at trial.

But in those jurisdictions

you have de novo review through usually a circuit court or a
court of general jurisdiction where you can be retried.

And

universally in those cases there is stenographic help.
Q

That's what I was trying to get to.

Your

position is that if you don't have a transcript, but you do
have de novo, that’s okay.
MR. FIELD:
Q

Well, if you have a trial de novo —

You get a transcript, don't you?

MR. FIELD:

— you get a transcript, and I don't

think that there would be a problem.
Q

That’s what I was trying to get at.

MR, FIELD: The important thing, when you examine the
impact on this defendant here — excuse me, my time is up

25

is that he needs to wipe his slate clean, and, as the briefs
examine, his future livelihood is really at stake.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Field.
MR. FIELD:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Curry.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. CURRY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. CURRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The issues, as the City of Chicago sees them, in
this case are two:
First, should the rule of Griffin vs. Illinois and
Williams vs. Oklahoma City be extended to afford free trans­
cripts to indigents appealing cases involving convictions of
what are generally recognized as merely petty offenses?
And secondly, does the classification between serious
and petty violate the Fourteenth Amendment in a fashion which
this Ccurt has considered in the past, and in other cases, to
be invidious?
We believe that both these questions oxjght to be
answered in the negative.
This Court, in Boddie vs. Connecticut, has recently
noted Hat the Griffin rule has had a sturdy growth, and 'I
submit that that growth was nourished greatly by the fact that
each srbsequent application of the rule in Griffin has been

26

based upon a fact situation which found (1) the personal liberty
of the petitioner in jeopardy and/or upon (2) the invidious
exclusionary consequences of the particular appellate practice
as it was applied to an indigent.
Neither of these threshold conditions exist in this
case.

Appellant here is not faced with the prospect of

incarceration, because he was charged with an ordinance
violation for which the only sanction was a fine.
And, secondly, the appellant himself has cavalierly
ignored alternate available avenues to perfect his appeal.
Mayer's Illinois Supreme Court appeal of the lower
court jury conviction has been docketed, and is awaiting the
disposition of this question in this Court.

He is not,

therefore, in the posture of Williams vs. Oklahoma City; and
your decision in that case ought not to be considered as
control .ing. .
Q

Well, Mr. Curry, if it's been docketed, on what

record of the Supreme Court of Illinois — is it in the Supreme
Court of Illinois?
MR. CURRY:

It's in the Supreme Court of Illinois,

Justice Brennan, yes, sir.
Q

On what record will the appeal be decided?

MR. CURRY:
that tb

It is hoped, quite frankly, Your Honor,

verdict in this case will require that Mr. Field use

his con; iderable talent, as was exhibited in his post-trial

27
motion of 14 pages, and reconstruct a settled statement, so
that the matter can be brought to the attention of the court.
It's our hope and expectation that the rule of
Griffin will not be expanded by this Bench.
Q

A settled statement, does that require agreement

between the parties?
MR. CURRY:

Yes, sir; it requires agreement similar

to the agreements, I submit, that are necessary to have
instructions to a jury.
Q

It's a bargaining session, I submit.

If there is disagreement, who settles in your

State?
MR. CURRY:

The judge would settle the disagreement

between the parties in a settled statement under the rules of
Illinois.
Q

And that may still be dor.e even at this late

stage?
MR. CURRY:

That would have to be done in order to

go forward with his Illinois Supreme Court appeal.
Q

How long ago was this trial?

MR. CURRY:
*69.

This trial was October of 1968 or '9

October 11, 1969.
Q

And tell me, will the trial judge, if you follox*

that me died, and you and Mr. Field could not agree on a
settled statement, and the trial judge has to construct it,
would hi have available a transcript for that purpose?

28
MR. CURRY;

The transcript is not available in tills

case, and therein lies the distinction.
Q

But my question, Mr. Curry, was:

would the

trial judge -— would it be made available to the trial judge
so that he could resolve the disagreement between, say, you and
Mr. Field on what the settled statement should be'2
MR. CURRY:
Q

I really don't know that, Your Honor.

Well, couldn't he call the reporter in and ask

the reporter to read —
MR. CURRY:

X was going to suggest — thank you,

Chief Justice — that that avenue of reviewing the untranscribed
portion of the reporter's notes is also an avenue which is
available to the appellant in this case.
I direct your attention to the —

in that.

C

Whet was fcliat again?

Q

Give us some of that, yes, we're both interested

Could he — let me put a specific question:

Could

Mr. Field, or someone representing the petitioner here, require
the co irt reporter to read his notes?
MR. CURRY:

I submit that it \7ould be his obligation

to point out to the court that he had tried that and that that
avenue was not available, that he was in fact effectively
forecl sed from the reasonable avenues to go forward with his
matter

and try to present an alternative to the court.
Q

Mr. Curry, I'm troubled with the fact that the

29

circuit court judge said, "Frankly, I don't care what you do,
you're not entitled to it.
"The rule says you can't get it."

He didn't mention

anything about any alternative, he made a rule on — his
ruling was based on the rule of the court, and that's what we
have before us.

Am I right?

MR. CURRY:

The rule of the court spoke in terms of

a felony at that time, Justice Marshall.
Q
court?

And wasn't that where it was in the circuit

When the ruling in this case was made, the judge wasn't

interested in any other thing.
ME:. CURRY:

Am I right or wrong?

You're right.

At the lower level, Your

Honor.
Q

And do you think he was right or do you think

he was in error?
MR. CURRY:
Q

He then went to the Supreme Court —

But do you think he was in error?

ME:. CURRY:

I think he was correct with his ruling,

Your Honor.
Q

Do you think he's correct now?

MR. CURRY:
Q

•

Why?

MR. CURRY:

I do, sir.
Because he ruled?
No, no, not because he ruled, because

there is, in the Supreme Court of Illinois, Rule 323, clear
and unm .stakable language which finds as its derivation the

30

case of Duncan vs, Louisiana» where alternates are specifically
suggested as ways that they state can allow an indigent to
proceed other than by a full verbatim transcript.
Q

But the circuit judge didn't.

He didn't give

him this opportunity.
MR. CURRYi

The circuit judge denied his motion for

a free transcript, you're right, on the basis, I submit though,
Your Honor, that an extension post-trial motion running 14 pages
here indicating the depth of perception that Mr. Field exhibited
at that time —
Q

I’m afraid I haven't made myself clear.

I think

you're arguing about the Supreme Court, the difference between
the ruling of the circuit court, as between courts; and as I
understand there is not too much disagreement between you and
Mr. Field on the Supreme Court, obviously, because he did
page after page of arguing this point.

In that I understand

that there is no disagreement.
I was just saying that the original ruling, I think,
was wroig.

Now, the Supreme Court's ruling, I think was a

different matter.

That was my only point.

MR. CURRY:

I submit, Your Honor, that it's my

contention that at the lower level it was one question:
he indigent?

is

And the court found, at the lower level, that he

was not qualified to apply for a free transcript under the rule
because he wasn't a felony.

31
When this question was brought to the attention of
the Illinois Supreme Court, the Illinois Supreme Court, Your
Honor, found that for the purposes of fees and filing fees,
they would waive because the expenses of the administrator of
the court, the court clerks, they are there for the State to
incur; but the State Supreme Court, in my interpretation of
what they've done, has said we ought not in this case provide,
at the expense of the State of Illinois, a transcript when
the petitioner has not shown any attempt to avail himself of
the other alternatives available.
Q

And that's the judgment we have before us.

MR. CURRY:
Q

Right, sir.

Whether to let him.

MR. CURRY:

Right.

Clearly.

We say that petitioner in this case is not in the
posture of Williams vs. Oklahoma City, and your decision in
that c©>e ought not to be controlling, because Williams was
locked

>ut of his Supreme Court by reason of the unavailability

of a ve rbatim transcript, and had faced a 90-day jail sentence.
In that case the trial court made specific findings that
Williams' argument had merit, that his appeal could not b®
properl;' prepared without a transcript, that neither Williams
nor his attorney could make up an adequate record from memory,
that a

-.ranscript was in fact in existence and available.
None of these conditions exist in the present case.

32

Although a complete verbatim transcript has been denied, Mayer
makes no attempt whatsoever to avail himself of the alternate
methods available to present a record to the Illinois Supreme
Court.
The Illinois Supreme Court Rule 323 (c) and {d) is
in clear and unmistakable harmony with this Court?s observa­
tions in Draper versus Washington -Q

May I ask, Mr. Curry, you are suggesting in

connection with the pending appeal in the Supreme Court, it is
still open to Mayer to demonstrate that the alternative
methods are inadequate?

That's still open in connection with

that appeal in the Supreme Court?
MR. CURRY:

1 believe he would not be foreclosed from

making that point.
Q

Now, then, if he succeeded in persuading the

Supreme Court that the alt-amative method would not be adequate
to pre sent his appeal, would it follow that tine Supreme Court
would

hen order a transcript?
MR. CURRY:
Q

I believe that that would be the case.

Notwithstanding the language of the rule that

limits the transcript to felony case?
MR. CURRY:
Honor, to 90 days.
Q

The language has now been reduced, Your
The change is not germane to this case.

Well, but I'm thinking of this case.

MR. CURRY:

Yes.

33

Q

If Mr. Field, in connection with the pending

appeal, were to demonstrate that an alternative method would be
inadequate, would the Supreme Court require that he be furnished
a transcript?
MR. CURRY:
Q

Well, why would they?

MR. CURRY:
Q

I believe they would, sir; yes, sir.

Because I believe, Justice White —

Because your new rule wouldn't reach this case

on the basis, I take it, that Illinois doesn't think transcripts
are required in any case where the penalty is under six months.
MR. CURRY:

I believe Illinois would be influenced

greatly by what transpired in Will-jams vs, Oklahoma, and be
very cautious, Your Honor, to see that the doors to the
appellate court were not foreclosed.
Q

If it were found that a verbatim transcript were

necessary for a decent appeal, you think that your Supreme
Court would think Williams required it?
MR. CURRY:
Q

I certainly do believe that, Your Honor.

Are you suggesting that the Supreme Court of

Illinois would have, among other powers, the power to order a
transcript under its supervisory jurisdiction over all lesser
courts in the State?
MR, CURRY:
Q

They certainly are.

Independent of whatever the rule would provida?

MR. CURRY:

Exactly.

The rule is not an absolute to

34

the extent that the Supreme Court then would ba in an impossible
position that it would recognize that a meaningful appeal could
not be brought, but its hands would then be effectively tied
to allow such an appeal to come forward.
I don't believe that that's a tenable situation, and
X don't think the Illinois Supreme Court would so interpret
their own rules.
The petitioner here, I submit, rejects out of hand
what Draper suggests, and it's not a hand to help-

the court

understand v/hy the alternative courses are found wanting.
Instead he asks this Court to expand Griffin beyond the clear
and meaningful limits of that rule, and its successors, beyond
the bounds of logic and beyond what I submit to be the
capabilities of the appellate processes in Illinois and perhaps
throughout the nation.
The troubled journey which Griffin and its successors
seek tc allcjviate for the indigent criminal defendant, as he
struggles to maintain his liberty, cannot abide, I submit,
his purposeful meandering off the path.

The record must

clearly disclose the inadequacies or unavailability of multiple
remedies.
Appellant makes no attempt in this regard, and I
submit rhat counsel errs in his brief, at page 37, when he
suggests that California requires no such showing.

The

California rule as to a free transcript in misdemeanor cases

35

is set forth in the 1370 case of Majasus vs, Superior Court,
reported at 3 Cal. 3d, page 54, wherein the court in that case
held that before an indigent misdemeanor is entitled to a free
transcript on appeal he must first attempt to reach an agree­
ment upon a settled statement.

A transcript will be provided

only if the parties cannot agree, or if a settled statement
would be inadequate.

The misdemeanor then, the court quotes,

"must show in a reasonably particularized presentation the
reason why he cannot inform the reviewing court by a settled
statement of the claimed inadequacies and errors."
I submit to you that it's impossible to determine
whether the parties cannot agree or whether a settled statement
would be inadequate unless there has first been a real attempt
at an agreement.
It's the burden of indigency that the cases seek to
relieve.

Mayer in this case would champion that cause into

a calculated disregard for the alternate methods of presenting
an appeal which this Court has previously approved of in both
Griffin and Draper, and which the Illinois Supreme Court has,
by rule, subsequently adopted.
If a full stenographer's transcript must be produced
as a matter of right or as a matter of simple preference,
unrelated to cost,

unrelated to convenience or necessity or

even un related to rule of court, then the alternatives to the
exfcravagance suggested in Draper must be overruled.

36

Q

I didn't understand that the claim in this case

is unrelated to particularized need in this case; as I under­
stood the petitioner, his claim is that because of the two
claimed errors in this case, insufficiency of the evidence and
prosecutorial misconduct, this happens to be one of those rare
cases, if you will, where a settled statement of facts is
simply inadequate.
MR. CURRY:

These two points were brought to the

Illinois Supreme Court on motion, not on brief, Your Honor.
And the extensive fashion in which they were discussed in the
brief in this Court, I submit, was not brought to the attention
of the court to that extents

That he alleged prosecutorial

error and prejudicial treatment in the manner that charges to
the jury were given in the broadest terms, in the same terms
that he has raised them in this Court.
Q

I didn't realize there were claims about the

instructions to the jury, I thought the questions were
insufficiency of the evidence and prosecutorial misconduct.
MR. CURRY:
Q

Right.

Insufficiency of the evidence.

And I further understood appellant's basic

claim to be that while in perhaps 99 and a half percent of
the casos of this kind an adequate and fair appeal could be
had on an agreed statement of facts or a settled statement,
there da exist some rare cases where that's insufficient;
and that, therefore, the rule of the Illinois Supreme Court

37

which just is a blanket rule, saying that in no case can there
be a transcript, as that violates the Fourteenth Amendment.
It's a little bit analogous to a case we had last
*

term, Groppe vs. Wisconsin, involving a rule of Wisconsin lav?
that said that in no misdemeanor case, in no misdemeanor case
could there ever be a change of venue.

And the claim was made

that in 999 out of 1,000, or perhaps more, misdemeanor cases
there wouldn't need to be a change of venue in order to accord
a fair trial.

But there could be the rare case where only a

change of venue could satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment and
provide a fair trial.
Arid that, as I understood it,was the petitioner's
claim hare.

He's attacking the blanket rule of the Supreme

Court of Illinois.
ME. CURRY:
Q

Do I misunderstand his argument?

MR. CURRY:
Q

I believe that he —

Do you understand it the same way I do?

MR. CURRY:
Q

But he's never tried —

— is overstating his argument, —

Well, maybe I'm overstating it.

MR. CURRY:

— Justice Stewart.

The point that I

think is important, and I think the meaningful reason for the
alternative in the Illinois Supreme Court rule is that it is
incumbent upon those to whom a transcript is not available,
either because of their indigency or because of their unwilling-

38

ness to pay for it from their own funds, that it^is incumbent
upon them before they ask the State to show the Illinois
Supreme Court why they can't bring the record to the court in
one of these alternate fashions.
He didn't do this in this case.
Q

And he is —

Well, how about this affidavit, part of which

appears in the petitioner's brief on page 12?

That was brought

before the Supreme Court of Illinois, wasn't it?
MR. CURRY:

I've lost you.

I:m in the abstract.

Are you in this abstract?
Q

No, I'm on the — in th© brief for the appellant,

on page 12.

I called him the petitioner; it's an appeal so he's

the appellant.

On page 12.

Isn’t that part of an affidavit that was submitted
to the Supreme Court of Illinois?
MR. CURRY:
Q

So, insofar as that —

MR. CURRY:
Q

I believe it was, yes.

But it's conclusory.

Well, what would you have him do?

MR. CURRY:

I would have him point out that he would

have inquired of the prosecutor as to the prosecutor' s
willing tess to be engaged in a settlement, a possible settled
statement before th© court.
Q

I don't suppose most prosecutors would agree

that thoy had engaged in misconduct.

39

MR. CURRY:

1 don't suppose they would, but I believe,

Your Honor, that we should have an airing of that issue for the
benefit of the rule, so that the Supreme Court would know that
its rule was not flagrantly being disregarded but there was an
attempt to adhere to the rule.

If he was able to come forward

and say that the prosecutor who handled this case was unavailable
or unwilling to participate and negotiate a settlement, I would
say that would be meaningful information for the Illinois
Supreme Court to have.
Q

But —

MR. CURRY:

If he had said that he had gone to the

trial judge and asked the trial judge what his minute book
showed as to notes, or what his recollection was, I would say
that those would be meaningful comments that the Illinois
Supreme Court would utilize in determining, then, the
appropriateness, the true meaningfulness of his application
for a free transcript, that he really would not be before them
in any aeani.ngful fashion unless he was able to have one or
the other.
I don't believe that the prosecutor would ba able to
foreclose his appeal by denying', if the prosecutor denied it,
then I chink the Illinois Supreme Court would remedy that by
granting him the free transcript.
Q

That's what you — and I was out of the room

for a moment; but I understand in colloquy you indicated that

40

this rule doesn't mean what it saye.
MR. CURRY:

I mean it's not as absolute as it's read.

1 mean that, in the application of the rule, the court would
clearly require an exhaustion, first, of the alternates and
then recognize that the mere filing would not give the person
presence before them, but it would be important for —■
Q

And what authority have you got to say that the

rule of the Supreme Court of Illinois does not mean what it
seems to say?
MR. CURRY:

Well, the authority would be on the

basis cf that court's close attention to the language of this
Court's decisions in Griffin and in —
Q

Yes, but do you know of any case where —

MR. CURRY:
Q

No, sir; there is no case that I know of.

Or have you got any direction or authority from

the Supreme Court of Illinois to make this representation?
MR. CURRY:

No.

I have none at the Illinois Supreme

Court level. Justice Stewart.
Q

Right.

MR. CURRY:

What I know clearly, though, at the lower

level, in the trial level there are a number of instances where,
despite the fact, that there are alternatives available, and
despite the fact that the rule calls for no transcripts over
90 days, that the trial level in many instances, in my
experience as Corporation Counsel, does grant a transcript to

41
the indigent»
Q

In other words, this is a matter of discretion

on the part of the trial court?
MR. CURRY:

It is utilized as a matter of discretion,

and not brought into challenge by the — in any case that I'm
aware of in Illinois.
Q

And I suppose your argument would be that if

the trial court at that lower level has that discretion, the

Supreme Court of Illinois has it within its supervisory power?
MU. CURRY:

I really believe that the weight and the

import of the Williams case would be so profound on the
Illinois Supreme Court that it just defies belief that they
would effectively render this petitioner's appeal meaningless
by denying him all avenues, if he were to effectively show
them that the two alternatives that they suggest are meaning­
less; then I do believe that they would remedy the incongruity
that exists there end require a free transcript be provided.
Q

Then, in other words, you're saying that the

rule as written is unconstitutional?
MU. CURRY:

I don't believe I'm saying that at all,

sir.
Q

I thought you did.

MR. CURRY:

I am obviously reading into it more than

the actual language is there, but I don't believe that the
rule is unconstitutional.

In fact, it follows *—

42

Q

Well, I thought you said that under the facts

of Williams vs». Oklahoma, that the rule as written is un­
constitutional; that if there is a showing that anything short
of a written transcript of the evidence will not give a
meaningful appeal, then there has to be a written transcript.
And this rule as i^ritten doesn’t provide for that,
MR. CURRY:
Q

Yes,

MR. CURRY:
Q

There has to be such a showing,

I said —

Yes, but the rule
— that there is nothing like that in —*

— doesn't make any exception for a written

transcript when there is any such showing; does it?
MR. CURRY:
Q

It does not, sir.

So the rule is unconstitutional, as I understand

it,
MU. CURRY;

The rule follows very closely the language

in Duncan, where alternatives were suggested by this Court as
a means that the State may utilize to avoid the impact of
extravagance, frivolous appeals, and what-have-you.

And I

submit that in following that logic, the court clearly
wrestled with this subject and has a rule which is in keeping
with Griffin and is in keeping with Duncan.
And when we come to a fact situation, which we
really laven’t come to in this case, or any case that I know
of in Illinois, where the two other alternatives are shown
to have been attempted and to be wanting in bringing a meaning-

43

fui record to the court.

We haven't come to the case where

then the Illinois Supreme Court would deny.
And I do believe that —
Q

What sort of case would you hypothecate that

would be such a case?
MR. CURRY:

Pardon?

I would hypothecate that there would never be such a
case in Illinois.
Q

You don't think there is any such case?

MR. CURRY:
Q

I don't believe there would be, sir.

Or could be?

MR. CURRY:

There could be, surely? but I don't

believe there would be.

For the simple reason that the purpose

of the rule, in ray opinion, clearly and unmistakably indicates
a willingness on the part of the Illinois Supreme Court to
have the litigant available to come before him and present a
meaningful record of what transpired.

It does, it presents

alternatives; and it seems to me that when you cavalierly
say,

'I don't want alternative B, I don't want alternative C,

I must have alternative A", that that's just not in keeping
with /hat the Illinois Supreme Court rule has in mind.
If you took away the first two problems, where he
did mset that issue, then I do believe that in Illinois a free
transcript would be forthcoming.
Q

I seriously, Mr. Curry, have great problems with

44
how you get an agreed statement on "prosecutorial misconduct
in many instances throughout the trial."
MR. CURRY:
Q

Prosecutor —

How you can do that without a transcript,, I

have great difficulty in thinking how.
MR. CURRY:

One of the errors alleged is that the

prosecutor limped in the courtroom.
injured in that same affair.

The prosecutor was also

He did limp in the courtroom.

And he would be, I am certain, perfectly willing to agree that
he limped in the courtroom that day, if that's prosecutorial
error.
I don't believe it is, but I know that —
Q

But I just don't know what other — he said

"throughout the trial".
MR. CURRY:
Q

But, neither, see —

A two-day trial.

Now, if he puts these statements dawn and submits
them, and they are not agreed upon, is he bound by those
statements?
MR. CURRY:

Is he bound by them?

I believe that it

would be very similar to what the — the negotiation that would
go on diring an agreed statement or a settled statement would
be very similar to the kind of negotiation that goes on when
lawyers and the judges get together over instructions to the
j ury

45
But the judge would settle —
Q

Haven"t you already told us, counsel, that on

all unresolved matters of settled statements the judge
resolved them?
MR. GURRYs The judge would resolve it.
Q

So that if the parties put down on paper what

they —
MR. CURRY:
Q

Exactly.

~~ agree on, and the judge supplies the vacant

spots, where they do not —
MR. CURRY:

That's my understanding of it, and he

would have available to him the notes, the minute notes that
he made as he sat there.

He would also have, I submit,

available to him the participation of the untranscribed notes
from the court reporter, if he shought them and thought they
were necessary.
Q

Was any request ever made by the then defendant

for having the reporter read any parts of the transcript?
MR. CURRY:
Q

X know of none.

And is any claimed in the record on behalf of

the petitioner, if you know?
MR. CURRY: There is none. There is none.
There is no showing throughout the record that any
attempt has been made to secure an agreed statement.

I take

issue with Mr. Field's statement that despite two days of trial

46
he would find it impossible to prepare such a statement; and
I would direct your attention to the extensive post-trial
notice, which appears in your abstract at page 11 through 22,
14 pages, I might add, of in-depth analyses of what did trans­
pire at that hearing.
I submit that this, almost in itself, would be tanta­
mount to a record made under either one of these proposals by
the Illinois Supreme Court.
The cases since Griffin give the support of the kind
of balance of judicial propriety found in Duncan.

That is,

the consequences to the defendant from the conviction of a
petty offense are insufficient to outweigh the benefits to
efficient lav; enforcement as simplified judicial administra­
tion.
In applying the Fourteenth Amendment, Rinaldi vs.
Yeager says these avenues of appeal must be kept free of
unreasoned distinctions.
I believe that there is a reasoned distinction in
the Illinois Supreme Court rule, the distinction being between
petty and serious, and I believe that that is a very important
distinction that ought be respected in future decisions by
the Court.
Q

And under the — the distinction in Illinois

between petty and serious is —
MR. CURRY:

Under the Supreme —

47

Q

— offenses for which you can go to prison, and

these for which you cannot?
MR. CURRY:
Q

Six months is the distinction made by —

Six months?

MR. CURRY:

— the Illinois Supreme Court rule.

Yes, sir.
Q

Up to six months?

MR. CURRY:
Q

The same as —

MR. CURRY:
Q

Right, sir.

Yes, sir.

— the federal rules.

MR. CURRY:

Right, the same as the federal rules, sir.

The classification would fail, we're told, in
Shapiro vs. Thompson, unless shown to be necessary to promote
a compelling governmental interest.
I submit to you that a compelling governmental
interest is very real here, in the viability of the court
systems, at the lower level but most apparently at the appellate
level,

if appeals on full transcripts to indigents are the

outgrow Ji of the rule of this case.
And, finally, in Boddie vs. Connecticut, the court,
mentioning the absence of countervailing State interest of
overriding significance, the classification must fail; I say
to you liat a classification such as we have here between
serious and petty is a countervailing State interest of over-

48

riding significance.
I v7Quld respectfully ask this Court to reject what is
urged by the appellant and not expand the rule in Griffin into
the petty offense area.
Thanh you very much.
Q

May I just ask one question before you sit down?

MR. CURRY:
Q

Certainly.

I'm looking at your Rule 323 (c>, that's on

the alternative —
MR. CURRY:
Q

— at page 4a —

MR. CURRY:
Q

Yes.

Thank you.

MR. CURRY:

Thank you,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Field;

thank you, Mr. Curry.
The case is submitted.
