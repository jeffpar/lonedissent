request of counsel, will be Mr, Barnett first, Miss Hall second,

Is that correct?

MR. BARNETT; That is correct.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well.

You may proceed,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY J. BARNETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
1* am the attorney for the respondent Earl D. Mosley.
This case is on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit, and it has been consolidated with the
case of Grayned vs. the City of Rockford, which is on appeal
from the Supreme Court of Illinois.
This case concerns a disorderly conduct ordinance of
the City of Chicago, -which prohibits all picketing on a public
way within 150 feet of a primary or secondary school.

The

ordinance exempts from this prohibition the picketing of a
school involved in a labor dispute.
Apri1 5, 1968.

It became effective on

Since September 1967, respondent Earl D. Mosley had
picketed Jones Commercial High School, located in the City of
Chicago*

Ha had. simply walked on the public sidewalk adjoining

Jones High School carrying a sign, which reflected his belief
that Jones High School was discriminating against blacks in its
admission policies and in the treatment that it afforded him.
It was admitted at trial by the City that at all times
Mr. Mosley9s activities were peaceful, orderly, and quiet.
It was further admitted at the trial, by petitioners,
that at no time did Mr. Mosley”s activities in picketing the
school by himself or with a few other persons ever cause a
disturbance at the school or interfere with traffic around the
school.
After being advised of the passage of this ordinance,
Mr. Mosley contacted the Chicago Police Department, and was
told that he would be arrested if he continued his activities
in picketing Jones.

The City admitted at trial that it intended

to enforce this ordinance, and, in fact, Mr. Mosley would be
arrested if he continued to picket the school.
He then filed this declaratory judgment action,
seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction against the
enforcement of this ordinance, on the grounds that it violated
his right to freedom of speech and that it was a violation of
the equal protection clause.
The lower court, after a trial, held that the ordi-

5

nance was constitutional»

On appeal, the Seventh Circuit

Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the ordinance on its
face violated Mr. Mosley’s rights to freedom of speech because
the ordinance was overly broad.
This ordinance is a violation of the First Amendment
right to freedom of speech because it is overly broad.

The

vice of this ordinance is that it sweeps within its prohibition
protected free speech, such as the quiet and peaceful picketing
of respondent Mr. Mosley.

In fact, Mr. Mosley engaged in

almost the identical activity as that engaged in by Mr. Thorn­
hill in the case of Thornhill vs. Alabama some 30 years ago.
This Court has held that peaceful picketing is
protected free speech.

And the State can regulate only the

abuses of picketing, which has been articulated as a test of
the regulation of the manner of picketing or the purpose of
picketing, when there is something in the manner or purpose
which gives grounds for the disallowance of that picketing.
Q

What about place?

MR. BARHETT;

If the Court please, at no time have I

been able to find any decision of the Court which has stated
that place and place alone is sufficient to permit, the regula­
tion of picketing.

It must be coupled with something in the

manner of picketing or the purpose of picketing, %/nich would
give grounds for the disallowance of that picketing.
Q

Well, do you think the statute would prohibit

s
you from picketing where you’re standing?
MR. BARNETT:

Period.

Well, I would say, Your Honor, that

that statute would be lawful; but, Your Honor, the difference
between that case and this case is that we have picketing here
on a public x^ay, which in no way — x^hich prohibits the
respondent in this case from lawfully and legitimately exer~
cising his right to freedom of speech.

The ordinance which

Your Honor, or the statute which Your Honor would propose, I
think would be attached to some legitimate State concern.
Q

All I’m trying to say is, I think you’re putting

too much baggage on your train; that’s all I was saying.
MR. BARNETT: Thank you.
Q

Are you familiar with, I think it’s Title 18,

Section 1501, that forbids picketing on the sidewalk around
this building?
MR. BARNETT:

1 am not familiar with that statute,

Your Honor; I am familiar with the Court’s action x^ith the
statute in Cox vs. Louisiana, which prohibited the picketing
of a courthouse with the intent to influence the administration
of justice.
Q

That’s the same statute.

MR. BARNETT: That statute, Your Honor, as the Court
noted, the Cox case was one which specifically dealt with a
purpose of picketing.

And the Court found in that case that

the purpose was legitimate — could legitimately be regulated

7
by the State, because the State had a legitimate interest in
protecting courts from the undue influence and the interference
with the administration of justice.
The problem with the City of Chicago ordinance is that
it is not a narrowly drafted enactment, it’s aimed specifically
at some evil, some abuse of picketing.
Q

Well, if this statute had in it — is it a

statute or an ordinance you're talking about?
MR. BARNETT:
Q

It's an ordinance, Your Honor.

An ordinance.

If this ordinance had in it that

no one could picket tvithin 150 feet of the school for the pur­
pose of disrupting the school, would you think that would come
within the Cost case?
MR. BARNETT:

I think that that statute may be

constitutional, Your Honor,

They would have to

the City

would then be put to proof at a trial in that case that it was
the intent of the person to disrupt the school.
Q

All right.

What if the words were "for the

purpose of influencing the administration of the school”?
MR. BARNETT:

I wouldn’t think that the City would

have, in that instance, a legitimate right to be concerned with
the influencing the administration of the school.
Q

In the Coat case the words were "for the purpose

of influencing the administration of justice".
MR. BARNETT: That’s correct, Your Honor, and in that

8

case the Court went on at great length to note that picketing
around a courthouse may cause an undue and oppressive influence
upon jurors, let us say, who were attending a trial in that
particular courthouse; and the hypothetical which Your Honor
posed, X would think that someone who picketed the school with
the intent to influence the adminstration of that school to get
them to, let's say, admit more blacks or to afford blacks
different treatment, such as Mr. Mosley's intent, that would
be a legitimate concern on his part and the State would not have
an overriding interest in preventing that type of conduct and
that type of free speech.
Q

He could picket it just as much as he could

write a letter to
MR. BARNETT: That's true. That's correct, Your Honor.
They're both means of his expressions of freedom of speech.
And that is the problem with this ordinance, because
what Mr. Mosley was doing was exercising nothing more them
protected free speech. The City admits that he never caused a
disturbance or interference with the school.

And yet this

ordinance arbitrarily creates a 150-foofc limit, within which
he is prevented from exercising those rights of freedom of
■%

speech.
Now, the City harps over and over in their brief
about disturbances and disruptions around schools as a means
for justifying this ordinance.

But the simple answer to that

9
is that this ordinance is not. directed at disturbances, at
disruptions, or picketing in such a manner as to creata dis­
turbances or disruptions around schools.
Q

There * s a Federal statute that forbids demonstra­

tions of any kind within either 500 feet or 1,000 feet of an
Embassy of a foreign country.

Would you. think that falls under

the same ban as the argument you’re making?
MR. BARNETT;

I think the Court, in one of its

decisions, indicated that the rationale of the Embassy ordinance
was that for security purposes; and the government had a
legitimate concern in that particular instance of protecting
these types of Embassies from potential violence and disriiptions.
Q

Well, in this case isn't the ordinance for the

purpose, and certainly does it not serve the purpose of avoiding
distraction of the students from their studies?
MR. BARNETT;

It may serve that purpose, Your Honor;

but, on the other hand, it brings everything within its ambit.
It prohibits all types of picketing, violent and disruptive
picketing as well as purely
Q

Well, aren't all types of picketing prohibited

under the Embassy statute?
MR. BARNETT; They are, Your Honor, and I would have
my doubts as to the constitutionality of that. As I stated,
I am not sure if that ordinance ■— that statute has ever been
passed upon.

But I think the rationale was that there was a

10
certain legitimate concern aboiit security around Embassies,
I would think, however, that one person who is peace­
fully picketing an Embassy and wanted to picket within the 500™
foot limit, that he ought to be entitled to do so under his
First Amendment rights to freedom of speech.

And that is

exactly what we have here in this case, for Mr. Mosley at no
time cause a disturbance around the school.

He at no time

interfered with the administration of the school or disrupted
any school activity.
0

Mr. Barnett, does the 150-foot limit carry any

weight with you?

Suppose there were no limitation at all, could

he picket on the school house steps, for instance?
MR. BARNETT;

No, I think that there would be — the

State would have the right to prevent people from coming on the
school house property as such, certainly in the protection of
students.

But this ordinance is specifically drafted to ba

Q

Well, suppose there were no school yard, some

of the old buildings, you know, abut right on the sidewalk.
MR. BARNETT;
Q

Yes.

What then?

MR. BARNETT:

I would think that on a public sidewalk

a person should have the right to peacefully picket and express
his views.

.And this Court has always sanctioned the use of

the public sidewalks and parks, in the recent Food Employees

11
case, as areas where historically First Amendment rights to
freedom of speech have been sanctioned and have been
Q

What about the hallways of the school building?

MR. BARNETT: Does Your Honor mean that if an ordinance
were drafted prohibiting picketing there?
Q

Well, let’s assume that this ordinance were

applied to someone picketing, walking up and down the halls of
the school, with the same sign?
MR. BARNETT:
Q

I would --

And no showing whatsoever of any disturbance or

anything else?
MR. BARNETT:

No, I would think that the State has a

applied in that fashion, Your Honor, because —
Q

Why?

MR. BARNETT:

— because the 150-foot limit is from

the exterior of the school, in my understanding of it.
Q

All right. But assume that the ordinance did

say Hin any school building” — ”on public property, in the
school building, or;within 150 feet of the school”?
MR. BARNETT:

I think that the State would have a

legitimate right to prevent picketing on its property in order
that it may run its school system.
Q

Well, why?

MR. BARNETT: Because

Q

Until there's a showing of some disruption?

MR. BARNETT; Well, I think an outsider, Tour Honor,
rather than a student, that a distinction can be drawn.
Because

certainly there may be some ~~
Q

Well, it must be, though, in terms of the

tendency to disrupt?
MR. BARNETT;
Q

I don't think the tendency —

Or to distract.

MR. BARNETT;

I don't think it's the tendency to

disrupt or distract, Your Honor.

I think an outsider may be

prohibited from coming on school property because of a possible
danger to students, a threat of some dis — harm to students.
Q

Well, yes, but that isn't what the ordinance

says. The ordinance says you can't come on here to picket.
MR, BARNETTS That's correct.
Q

And there's a lot of strangers permitted on the-’

school property, for all sorts of purposes.
MR.. BARNETT; Well, 1 think that those would all foe
connected with the school, such as a deliveryman or something
like that, Your Honor. But to come on school property as such,
inside a building, to picket, I think might cause a disruption
and I think the State would have & legitimate concern to
protect its students.
Q

All right, might cause a disruption.

MR. BARNETT;

Yes.

But I don't think that —

13
G

Welly how about the 150 feet?

you're simply

saying the State hasn't any basis for saying that it might cause
a disruption —MR. BARNETTS
disruption is enough.
Q

No, I don't think the might cause a
In fact, in the recent Tinker case, —

Welly it is inside the school building.

MR. BARNETTs Well, I — I'm not -- my argument on
that is twofold. Your Honors

one, it may well cause a disruption

of the school activities? and, secondly, I think the State has
a legitimate concern in protecting the interests of students
in terms of bodily ham to them from outsiders indiscriminately
coming inside tfye school building,
Q

Well, you're just saying — you're just repeating

the argument in different words.

It's in terms of its tendency

to disrupt the school and to impinge on the rights of students.
MR. BARNETT:

No, Your Honor,

t

think it's a

difference in — a qualitative difference, between someone
standing outside a school on a public sidewalk, walking in
front of that school, as between a person coming in the school,
where there may well be a danger of physical harm to students,
which certainly the sTate has an interest in protecting.
Q

Although the ordinance says you can't come in

and communicate with students with a sign in a hallway of
the school? that's what the ordinance says.
MR. BARNETT: That's correct,Your Honor.

14
Q

Well, it hasn’t anything to do with physical

things, does it?
MR, BARNETT:
Q

No* the ordinance — the ordinance —

It has to do with insulating — insulating

students and faculty members and anybody else in the building
from a communication like this.
MR. BARNETTs The ordinance prohibits, Your Honor,
picketing on a public way, within 150 feet of the school.
Q

Your time is up, of course, —

MR. BARNETTS
Q

Sorry.

— and you haven't said a word about anyone

involved in a labor dispute can do everything that this ordinanc
says this man couldn’t do, could he?
MR. BARNETTs That is correct, sir.
Q

And that’s your equal protection argument?

MR. BARNETTs
Q

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

Why should he be — someone involved in a labor

dispute be allowed to do this and this man, Mosley, be
prohibited.
MR. BARNETT: That is our argument, Your Honor.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Miss Hall.

Thank you, Mr. Barnett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS SOPHIA H. HALL,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MISS HALXjs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
My defendant is -— ray client is Richard Grayned.
was con- -- he was —- he participated in a demonstration.

He
He

was arrested, convicted, and fined for violating two ordinances
of the City of Rockford.
One of the ordinances is the same as the one in the
Mosley case.

It involved a hundred — not picketing or

demonstrating within 150 feet, and excepted the person picketingin support of a labor dispute.
The other ordinance prohibited a person engaged in
conduct wherein he wilfully made or assisted in the making of
a noise or diversion which disturbed or tended to disturb the
peace or good order of the school session.
The defendant — and we have constantly, throughout
the litigation, contended that these two ordinances are both
unconstitv<tional, that they are violative of the Fourteenth
Amendment, and that it represents an interference by the State
with a parson’s right to picket or to speak or assemble.
The facts in the Grayned case, prior to the proceeding
in this Court, have not been disputed,

The record went up to

the Supreme Court on a short record, there was no transcript of
proceedings of what occurred in the trial.

The motion was

1

16
mada before the Illinois Supreme Court.

Without objection of

counsel,, we submitted the case on the facts as represented in
the brief„ in the briefs which we submitted.
For the first time, the City of Rockford has disputed
the facts in this case.

And I submit that they not only have

disputed them but they have also made misstatements of fact.
I have with me a report of proceedings that occurred
in the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in the
case of the City of Rockford vs. Richard Grayned.

This

report of proceedings was ordered by our office, and at our own
expense, it was not supplied by the City of Rockford.

We ordered

it back in November, and it was delivered to us this past
Monday, on January 17th.
I brought this report of proceedings with me because
I thought the Court might be interested in seeing what the
facts were in this case, since they are now apparently in
dispute.
Q

Miss Hall, as I read the opinion of the Supreme

Court of Illinois, it didn't treat any factual .issue.

I gather

it was just an appeal on the question of whether a statute or
ordinance such as this was constitutional.

Would you agree

that that was a correct reading, at least, of the Supreme Court
of Illinois8 opinion?
MISS HAIiL: That is true, but the Stipreme Court did
mention the facts in the ease, as they thought were relevant,

17
and facts were set out in the briefs.

The Supreme Court stated,

in the beginning of their opinions, that a demonstration was held
in front of the school* at West High School»
Q

Was any State law point made to the Supreme

Court of Illinois that the evidence was insufficient to support
the conviction?
MISS HALL:
Q

None whatsoever»

The

You’re not making any such point as that here?

MISS HALL:

Not at all»

But the only reason I bring

this record to this Court's attention is that there are facts
stated in the appellee’s brief which are not true»
Q

Miss Hall, are you willing to leave that with

the Clerk?
MISS HALL:

I certainly intend to do so, and I

mentioned it to Mr. Collins when I arrived at court, I mentioned
it to him before lunch, he said he would think about it, and
then after lunch he told me that he would join in the submission
of this report of proceedings.
And I intend to leave it with the Clerk before I
leave.
Q

Is it your submission that if this ordinance

had said r‘all demonstrations of 40 or more people within 150
feet of th© school building are prohibited”, that if the
ordinance said that in so many words, is it your submission
that it would b© unconstitutional?

18
MISS HALLs
Q

You6re not just arguing overbreadfch, then?

Miss HALL;
Q

Yes, Your HOnor, it would be.

t am arguing overbreadth.

Is that your fundamental position?

MISS HALL; That’s the fundamental position with
respect to Section 18.1{i>, and we also argue that 18.1(1)
violates the equal protection clause.
In our particular case —
Q

But you’re also saying, I take it, that even if

this ordinance were limited to just covering demonstrations of
40 or more people, that it would be unconstitutional?
MISS HALL:

If —~ if — are you saying that if the

ordinance stated that 40 or more people could demonstrate on ~~
Q

May not —■ may not demonstrate.

MISS HALL:

May not demonstrate.

I would say it was

unconstitutional.
Q

So your argument is not just overbreadth, then,

is it?
MISS HALL:
Q

Xt8s not — it’s not

And that this particular activity that was

actually carried on may not be prohibited?

MISS HALL:
Q

That’s right.

What about a thousand or more?

MISS HALL:

Same argument?

Your Honor, I think that to try and use

numbers, as ,150 feet and the number of people, avoids the whole

19
problem involved here.

We're concerned with the interests of

the State, which are involved? we're concerned with what the
people who are picketing are concerned about picketing.
Q

What about —

MISS HALL: We're concerned about the effect of their
conduct.
Q

Would you not agree that a thousand people,

milling around the entrances of the school, the access streets„
*

would create —*
MISS HALLt
Q

If a thousand ~

—* more of a problem than one person?

MISS HALL:

If an ordinance x*as passed which said

that there could not be so many people picketing who obstructed
the ingress and egress with respect to the school, who stop
traffic# who praventec3 people from using the public way? if
that's what the ordinance said, as it — if that's what the
ordinance said, then it would be consistutional.
But there's no evidence of that here.
There were 200 people in our particular instance
who walked up and down the sidewalk in front of West High School,
carrying signs which said that black cheerleaders may cheer too,
black teachers — we want black teachers for
courses.

black

history

They walked up and down in a peaceful and orderly

fashion.
And then the police came# they turned on their loud-»

20
speakers, read their ordinances over the loudspeakers and
started to arrest people.
Q

Miss Hall —

MISS HALL; And the facts in this case show that that’s
when it appeared that people started to watch what was going
on.
Yes?
Q

But under 19.2 your clients would have to have

been found guilty of wilfully making or assisting in the making
of any noise or diversion which disturbs or tends to disturb
the peace or good order, would they not?
MISS HALL; That’s correct, Your Honor, and 1 submit
that that language is vague and it does not comport with the
standards of due process of law in giving due notice to the
parsons who wish to comply with the law, and who, at the same
time, wish to exercise their First Amendment freedoms, does
not give them an opportunity to exercise them? becavise they
don’t know what they’re going to be arrested for.
Q

So your attack on that section of the ordinance

is not based on the First Amendment but on grounds of vagueness?
MISS HAIL2

Your Honor, it’s also based on the First

Amendment, because, by its vagueness which violates due process,
it is subject to an overbroad application to perfectly protected
constitutional freedoms.
Q

You would — what would be your view of the

21
statute prohibiting picketing on the sidewalk adjacent to
this building?

Unconstitutional?

MISS HALL:

I would have to — the people who drafted

the statute, what would be their purpose in drafting it?

What

State interest would they want to protect?

Would they want

to protect, this Court from being disturbed?

The statute in

Cox vs, Louisiana concerned one that was narrowly drawn, v?hieh
said, "We will prohibit picketing of 'parsons who seek to
disturb" -- I don't have the exact language of it — "disturb
the processes of the administration of justice."
In that particular instance, where it’s the court is
concerned, and where it's so narrowly drawn, as this Court held
it was, I would say that it was —
Q

You think it's unreasonable, then, for a

legislature, a law-making body, to conclude that as many people
as you had here, 200, has the tendency to disturb the
educational process?
MISS HALL s

I think Justice Stewart made the appro­

priate statement when he wrote this Court's opinion in
Tinker vs. Des Moines.

He said:

there must be a substantial

showing that there would be an interference with the orderly
process of the school administration.
There has been no such showing in this particular case,
Your Honor.

As a matter of fact, I think it is important —

and 1 am in accord with this decision — it is important that

22

students in our schools be allowed to see and to participate in
exercising their First Amendment freedoms, so that in the
school they are not only taught the Three R’s, but they're also
taught how to be citizens in this country and how to exercise
their rights as guaranteed by the First Amendment.
Q

May 1 ask, Miss Hall, what were

the penalties

imposed here?
MISS HALL;

Mr. Grayned was fined $25 for violating

18.1(1) and $25 for violating 19.2(a).
Q

That’s different from the other case?

MISS HALL:
Q

Plus court costs.

The ~ what case?

The other case involved here.

MISS HALL:

In the Mosley case, there was no arrest,

there was no conviction, ther© was no fine.

His was a

declaratory judgment action.
My client has been —
• Q

But at least the other action concerns only one

ordinance?
MISS HALL:

The other action; that’s right.

Mine concerns two
0

Two ordinances?

MISS HALL:

Right.

19.2(a) being the second

ordinance.
Q

19.2(a) has no

MISS HALL:

exemption to labor unions?

Ho, it does not.

It applies to "any

23
person”.
Q

Do you think it?s a denial of equal protection

if the law-making body thought a labor dispute was entitled to
a higher order of picketing rights than just any other people?
MISS HALL t

Yes, I do,

And I also would say that it is significant in my
particular case that the City of Rockford has eliminated the
labpr picketing distinction.
Nov? Section 18»! (i) is just that all labor picketing
all picketing, completely, is prohibited within ISO feet.
Which shows that at the time this ordinance was applied to my
client, it not only is an admission by the City that it not
\

only violated the Constitution, but — or it shows that
obviously the labor picketing exemption had no compelling State
interest to warrant it being there.
So that at the time this ordinance was applied to my
client, the City admits that it violated the Constitution.
Q

I don't suppose the City would agree with you

that the change in the ordinance has that meaning and only that
meaning, though, would it?
MISS HALL;

I would presume that they would bring

forth some other reasons.

But I submit that this change at

this time shows that it has no compelling State interest.
I wanted to make a point about 19.2(a).

I already

have mentioned that I think it violates due notice, because a

24
person can’t know what conduct is prohibited,, so even if he
is trying to comply with the law and at the same time exercise
his constitutional rights, he does not have an opportunity to
— consequently he cannot act at all, without fear of going to

jail.
The other point is that with respect to 19.2(a), as
the ordinance is drafted, it says that a person who wilfully
makes a noise or diversion would violate that section? and
then it seems to modify that with "which disturbs or tends to
disturb the peace and good order of the school session".
I submit that what is happening is that the person is being
convicted when he makes a noise or diversion and his intent is
just to make the noise or diversion, not to disturb or
disturb the peace and good order of the school session.
Q

May 1 ask, Miss Hall, was that record you're

going to leave with us, is there evidence in that that there
was noise?
MISS HALL?

Yes, there’s evidence, Your Honor. But

the evidence shows that noise came from the use of the police
loudspeakers.
0

In other — well, what Icm really asking you*

Is there any evidence that there was any noise by the group
whom you represent?
MISS HALLs

Kow many were there?

Forty “-odd?

I *— there were 200 demonstrators who were

in front of the school.

Forty males were arrested.

And I

25
represented those ~~
Q

Was there any evidence that those forty —

MISS HALL:
Q

My client, Richard Grayned -~

— were noisy?

MISS HALL:

No, there's no evidence with respect to

Richard Grayned, because, as you can see from the common“law
record, Richard Grayned was not charged and convicted of making
a noise, he was charged and convicted of .making a diversion.
So with respect to him —
Q

Well, what's the evidence that he made a diver­

sion?
MISS HALL:

I submit the record to this Court to find

it.
Q

You mean there's none in it, such as to ■—

MISS HALL: As far as I can see, there's no —
Q

Is this a Thompson v. Louisville kind of thing

you're suggesting?
MISS HALL:

I -- we had not raised that argument

in our brief, Your Honor.

I would suggest that there was noise

at the scene, and the noise came when the loudspeakers were
used by the police officers.
Q

Well, whatever that may be, is there any

affirmative evidence that your —• is the only one we have here
Mr. Grayned?
MISS HALL:

Mr. Grayned, that's right.

26
Q

Any evidence at all in this record that he was

noisy —
MISS HALL: That he was noisy?
Q

and that he created the diversion?

MISS HALL: There’s no evidence that he was noisy,,
and I am just — [a sigh] — I would say there was no evidence
that he personally *— personally, himself — was making a
diversi,on .
Q

Were other people --

MISS HALL:

Now, whether they would consider assisting

in the entire demonstration that they made a diversion, I would
say there's no evidence for that, because, I say, that the
record will show that at the time there was evidence of a large
number of people standing in the windows at the school it was
after the loudspeakers were used by the police, in reading the
ordinances to them.
Q

Miss Hall, you didn’t raise any Thompson vs.

Louisville point in the Supreme Court of Illinois?
MISS HALL:
Q

No, I did not, Your Honor.

But you said 40 were arrested?

MISS HALL: There were 40 demonstrators who were
arrested.
Q

Well, were they all convicted?

MISS HALL:
Q

The —

I mean, is this a symbolic case or what?

27
Because it * s —
MISS HALL:
Q

Because there were 40 cases ~-

*— just that in the case that was brought here

is the one that has no record cn it as to what the rnan did.
MISS HALL: And that's the record I'm bringing to you
now.
Q

Yes.

There's nothing in there to show that he

did anything?
MISS HALL: That he — there is evidence in there
x

that ha participated in the demonstration.

But there's nothing,

in ray judgment, to show that the diversion

the diversions

were committed by the demonstrators.
Q

Well, is;there anything in the record that shows

that this man Grayned opened his mouth?
MISS HALL:
something, Your Honor.

Said anything?

I — I wouldn't be surprised if he said
And I don’t know what the record shows

exactly to his commenting to the people around him.
Q

I'll read it and find out.

MISS HALL:

I submit that I am here for Richard

Grayned, and I am asking this Court to sustain the faith of the
citizens of Rockford that this Court will protect their right
to exercise their freedoms, which are protected from State
interference through the Fourteenth Amendment.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Miss Hall.

28
Mr, Curry,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. CURRY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, CURRY;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
The issues of this case, as viewed by the City of
Chicago, are three;
Does the claim of a free man to use the streets as a
public forum exclude even modest regulations as to the time and
place within which his rights may be exercised?
Two, if modest regulations aren't permissible in
protecting substantial governmental interest, is Chicago in
error in ascribing such importance to its schools?
And, three, is the Chicago ordinance void

by reason

of being overbroad?
The City of Chicago believes that the rule of this
case ought to answer each question in the negative.

The

ordinance before the Court is a partial restriction as to
picketing and demonstrating around elementary and secondary
schools? reasonable as to time, that is during classes and
a half hour before and after? and reasonable, I submit, as to
place, that is within 150 feet of the school building.
When local government is attempting to harmonize and
accommodate conflicting demands for the use of streets, the
standards as to time and place are every bit as relevant as the

29

Controls upon manner and purpose.
This ordinance ought not be viewed as a ban on First
Amendment rights.

It is clearly and properly a phasing or

timing of the activities in a recognition that at a certain
time and within a certain limited area there does exist competing
interest which the City may rightly acknowledge and regulate.
The purpose of the ordinance and the reason for its
passage, and the reason for the phasing and timing contained in
it, is that the City sought to impose a very simple ordinance
on school picketing.

The City Council sought to assure that

school kids have a setting for education where tranquillity,
order, calm and quiet might prevail, or at least not be
minimized by introducing picketing or demonstrating and their
customary counterparts.
?

Adderly vs. Florida tells us that there may be some
public places which are so clearly committed to other purposes
that their use for airing grievances is anomalous.
In ftdderly it was the private driveway to the jail.
In Cox vs. Louisiana it was near a courthouse.

And in Cameron

vs, Johnson it was access to public buildings.
Chicago believes that the school house ought to receive
similar insulation from what, has been traditionally described
as speech plus activities while classes are in session.
The ordinance in Chicago was passed in response to
widespread and ugly demonstrations which were taking place on a

30

daily basis at elementary schools where black students were
being bused for the first time»
The respondent Mosley would have this Court believe
that an ordinance with such a derivation was merely a ploy for
stifling his cry for a larger black enrollment at Jones
Commercial High School.
Q

Mr. Curry.

MR. CURRY:
Q

Yes, sir?

You say that you're trying to do the same thing

that is done in Cox.
MR. CURRY:
Q

Yes, sir.

And it appears from the decision of the Court

of Appeals, Judge Hastings decision, he said:

that’s just the

point, if you all said what Cox said, it would be valid.
Isn’t that what he said?
MR. CURRY: The court found the ordinance of the City
of Chicago to be overbroad and answered no further questions
in issue, Justice Marshall.
That's my recollection, sir.
Q

He says that it was because it was narrowly

drawn to protect a valid State interest.

That's what he said

in
MR. CURRY:
Q

You're reading from Cox, sir?

No, sir? I'm reading from Judge Hastings,

MR. CURRY:

Judge -- it's my recollection — I

31
certainly don't quarrel with your reading of the order, sir*
It's —
\

Q

It’s the opinion I'm reading from.

MR. CURRY:

The court’s order, as my interpretation

was, was that it was strictly and solely on overbreadth * that
it —
Q

Yes, but that’s what he ---

MR, CURRY;
Q

)

~ did classify ~

—* said, that if you had written one like Cox,

he would have upheld it.
MR. CURRY;

That's what I gather from this.

Wo, we submit, Justice Marshall, that

this is very narrow; this ordinance is narrow and is not vague.
The ordinance is precisely drawn and patently designed to
accomplish its objectives.

It thus fits the Court's oft-

repeated description of the kind of law that should be drawn
in the State's exercise of generally unquestioned constitutional
power to regulate picketing and street activity.
The ordinance does, as Thornhill directs us, aim
specifically at evils within the allowable area of State
control and does not leave one to guess at where fanciful
possibilities end and intended coverage begins.
Q

Well, why the exception, then, for labor

picketing?
MR. CURRY;

Mr. Justice Brennan, the exemption for

labor picketing has its derivation in these facts:

the primary

32
goal of this legislation was public-issue picketing.

That was

the question that the City of Chicago was confronted with on its
streets at the time this ordinance came up. There was then no
none, nor had there been in the memory of those in the City
Council, any public school labor picketing at all.
Q

Well, ray — you mean you don't suggest that labor

picketing, particularly when it involves schools, is not a
public-issue picketing?
MR. CURRY:

Yes. But public picketing in Illinois,

when it involves school teachers or school employees, public
employees generally, is determined by the rule of law in
Illinois that that picketing is contrary to public policy and
can be enjoined by State action.
Q

Well, then, what kind of labor picketing are

you going to have around schools?
MR. CURRY:

You would have the kind that could be

enjoined by appropriate State action, a remedy being available
to meet this possibility, the City of Chicago felt in drawing
a very narrow ordinance would only relate our ordinance to the
experiences that were then prevalent in the streets. That was
labor — not labor picketing, but public-issue picketing.
Q

Suppose Mosley was carrying a sign saying that

”The City of Chicago is unfair to organised labor”?
MR. CURRY:
Q

Within 150 feet of the school —

Within one foot.

33

MR* CURRY: Within one foot»

The City of Chicago —

wall, that would be picketing — that would not b® labor
picketing at a school.

He would be in the same posture, I

submit, as he was by carrying a sign which said that this school
was racially —
Q

Well, suppose the Mosley sign said, "I support

•the labor dispute between Union ABC and the City of Chicago"?
X use the words "labor dispute" because that's what your argu­
ment says.
MR. CURRY:

Right.

If — rather than quarrel on the

terms of what Mosley's sign says, if Mosley's sign is clearly
or appropriately considered a labor picketing sign, Mr. Justice
Marshall, then clearly he would fall within the exception here
and the State action against him would be in the nature of an
injunction because public —
Q

Didn't the State also prosecute him under this

ordinance?
MR, CURRY: The City of Chicago would prosecute him
under this ordinance only — only -Q

It couldn't.

MR. CURRY:
Q

I'm sorry?

It couldn't, could it, because he'd com© under

the exception?
MR. CURRY:

If he was engaged in labor picketing,

it could not prosecute him under this ordinance, clearly.

34
Q

And you say this exact same man, with the exact

same stick but a different sign on it?
MR. CURRY: A different sign, because there are an array
a plethora of remedies available to the lav; enforcement agencies
under the NLRB Act, because he's a public employee, his
activities can be enjoined under the public policy of the State
of Illinois»

This Court has found that classifications would

only be stricken if they are invidious,

I submit that this is

not an invidious classification, it's —
Q

Was that argument made to the Court of Appeals?

MR, CURRY:

I didn't make the argument there, sir.

I'm not certain.
Q

Well, was it mentioned in the opinion in the

Court of Appeals?

This argument?

MR. CURRY: The argument on invidious discrimination?
To my recollection, it was not.
Q

Mr. Curry, would the National Labor Relations

Act cover public employer such as the school?
MR. CURRY; The National Labor Relations Act exempts
the public employee, you're right. But that public employee
then, if he*3 picketing, would find that .the State would be
enacting the thrust of public policy in enjoining his conduct,
Q

So it's State pre-emption —■

MR. CURRYs Yes, sir.
Q

— as against the City, rather than —

35
MR. CURRY s

It would be State pre-emption for the

public employees, and it would be National Labor Relations
Board — national federal pre-emption for those employees who
were neither civil, public-issue oriented, public employee
related»

They would be -» that would’ be a third category»

tod we feel — we felt at the time this ordinance was drafted
that there was adequate remedies for the other two eventualities
around our schools.

There was not adequate protection for the

school children against the kinds of distractions and dis­
turbances that generally and usually follow the picketing and
demonstrating in the streets.
Q

X suppose therefs no specific legislative

history ssetant which would show that?
MR. CURRYj There is not, sir.
By his posture in this ease, if the Court please,
Mosley would arrogate to himself unfettered use of the sidewalk
actually abutting the school.

His choice of the public forum

to remain unencumbered by restrictions as to time and place,
so long as he is peaceful.

Having thus gained his stage, he

addresses his protect to what is clearly a captive audience:
the students themselves, forced to attend by State regulations
requiring daily attendance.
Having rejected the alternative of being across the
street, or the alternative of coming back when the school is out,
it is clear that Mosley's protest is intended primarily for

3S
student consumptione

And hera the analogy between Mosley and

the hate-oriented group that meets the bus at the other schoolsf
and which this ordinance is related directly $:o, becomes clear
for the first time»
The analogy is absolutely precise because there, too,
the activity is intended for student consumption *

While

respondent cleverly tests this ordinance without arrest, and
jokingly characterises his presence at Jones as, quote, "sort of
a nuisanc© value, especially whan 1 was in front of the school",
the real object of this ordinance, the hissing, booing, snarling,
threatening, and intimidating entrance way mob waits in the
Illinois appellate court for this decision to resolve their
case o
The liberty guaranteed by the Constitution is liberty
regulated by law in social compact, and in order that all men
may enjoy liberty, it is but the tritest truism to say that
©very man ought, if not must, renounce unbridled license»
Liberty can only be exercised, this Court reminded
us in the Cox case, liberty can only ba exercised in a system of
law which safeguards order.
For these reasons, and for those elaborated in our
principal reply brief, and in recognition of the substantial
governmental interest in education and the relevancy of the time
and place criteria established by the Chicago ordinance, in
protecting that substantial governmental interest.from dig-

37
turbaries and distraction, 1 would hope that this Court would
reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals of the Seventh
Circuit and uphold the validity of the Section 193 of the
Municipal Code of the City of Chicago»
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Curry.

Mr. Collins.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. COLLINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. COLLINSs

If the Court please;

As you now know, this Rockford appeal is identical
to the Chicago one, in that the anti-picketing ordinances in
both cities were identical.
It differs in some respects;as counsel pointed out,
the City of Rockford recently amended the anti-picketing
ordinance by eliminating deleting the provisions providing that
this subsection does not prohibit the peaceful picketing of
any school involved in a labor dispute.
Counsel comes to the conclusion that this represents
admission on the part of the City that the anti-picketing
ordinance, as originally passed, was obviously unconstitutional.
We recognise, of course, that the amendment the City of Rockford
made has no bearing whatsoever on appellant's personal
situation.
However, when we're talking about motivation

38
that counsel provides us, the fact is that there could be a
question on the Fourteenth Amendment, and the discriminatory
provisions of the labor dispute exemption.

There could be.

And the City of Rockford, the City Council felt, as, incidentally
do other City Councils and other school boards throughout the
length of this country, that if that is the problem we will
delete and wa did delete the labor dispute exception.
It is by no means an admission that the Fourteenth
Amendment has been violated.
Q

How would a particular school in Chicago, as

distinguished from a department of education, have a labor
dispute with someone? What would be the occasion?
MR. COLLINSs
.J

In Rockford we couldnat.
•

.

We have a

• ••

school board that, not too long ago, was co-terminus with the
City.

Our school board now is completely apart, elected at

different elections.

I don't know how the school board is

in Chicago.
Q

Well, 3: mean in Rockford.

I was misspeaking

myself.
MR. COLLINS:

Q

Yes.

flow could your ”a particular school88 in Rockford

have a labor dispute?

Is it possible?

MR, COLLINS: The only way I know of — yes, I suppose
the- building trades doing the construction of the school may
have soma, dispute, and possibly —

39
Q

Does that have to do with the particular school

or with the contracting authority?
ME, COLLINS: Well*, if 1 were running the labor union,
ray pickets would be down at the Board of Education offices.
But 1

I think it's possible that there could be some labor

dispute.

It’s never happened in our town, it could happen.

And 1 suppose it’s possible, and that8s what counsel is talking
about, possibilities? that there could be some pickets that they
use non-union labor to build Eisenhower school, for instance.
Ordinarily it wouldn't have any application to this
ordinance, because it*s confined to while the school is in
session.

And ordinarily you don't have the school in session

until the school is built.
Anything is possible.

I have the same question.

That's about all I can say.
Is it probable?

And the reason, or one of the

reasons that our legislative body exempted labor disputes is,
frankly, we have no trouble in that connection? and legislators,
being what they are, generally legislate toward some specificsituation .
q

Which ordinance came first, Chicago's or Rock­

ford's?
MR. COLLINS; We copied the Chicago ordinance.
that very often happens in —
Q

Was this adopted in hyperbola verses?

And

40
MR. COLLINSs

Identical.

Identical.

Q

Yota*re referring to

Q

But didn't pay that much attention, perhaps, to

this —
MR. COLLINS:

Had I known at the time that this was

going to happen — [laughing]

> I would have thought up my own

ordinance.
Q

You’re referring now to 18.1 rather than

MR. COLLINS:

18.1, yes.

Now# there's another difference in that in the
Rockford situation we have a set of facts which apparently,
so far as th® appellant is concerned, did not become important
until a couple of day® ago.
1 might add that neither side wrote a transcript of
the testimony until two days ago, and this Court, on April 25th,
■

!

..

1969, there was no demand made by. counsel upon me at any time
for a transcript, and there was no effort made, as can be
done in Illinois, if we're talking about facts, to get an
agreed statement of facts.
Q

Well, you don't — you don't suggest that the

that you should have judgment here because this case may have
involved a lot of people or that —
MR. COLLINS;

No.

No.

The only way we know it

involved any people is counsel, in its brief, appellant's
brief, mentions there were 200 people.

And now we have the

41
transcript of testimony.
Q

Would you --

MR. COLLINSs
Q

1 hop© ■—

— this case is not going to be —

Would you suggest that you should lose this

case if the ordinance is unconstitutional if applied to one
person picketing?
MR, COLLINS:
in Coates

Cincinnati

I'm not sure. And of course the opinion
is what gives me pause on that.

Whether tills may develop, that —
Q

Well, the ~-

MR. COLLINS:

-- the ordinance is unconstitutional

in its application.
Q

Yes. The ordinance on its face would apply to

one person picketing the school?
MR. COLLINS:

Yes, it would.

And there's no question

about that.
0

And if it would, and if it were unconstitutional

if it did that, would you say the ordinance is invalid on its
face?
MR. COLLINS:

I frankly don't know.

In Coates vs.

Cincinnati, apparently I think you, yourself, had some
question about whether
Q

Well, I said that wasn't a speech case.

I

approached it as a non-speech case.
MR. COLLINS: That is right.

And picketing, of course.

42

is not strictly a speech case»
0

Well, not strictly, but it does have those

elements»
MR. COLLINS i

I personally would be willing to stand

on the ordinance as written»

And although we had 200 people,

we had a four or five-hour disturbance, and Mosley was just
walking tip and down all by himself, I suppose that one has to
trust somewhat into the discretion of the school administra­
tors and the police.
Q

Well, would you say that it would be fair to

your side to considor this case as though we had a one-person
picket and the ordinance was applied to that?
MR. COLLINS:

I don't know if it'd be fair, but X

can see where this Court might take that attitude»
The -- we did have 200 people, and we had disruption
and when counsel speaks of this transcript, apparently she and
I may not have the same transcript.

But the one X have indicates

that there was disruption and things came to a halt inside the
school for about three or four hours.
Q

What did this man, Gerhart or whatever his name

is — do?
MR. COLLINS: Grayned.
Q

Grayned.

MR. COLLINS:

Q

Well —

That's in the record.

43
MR. COLLINS: That’s in the record before 'you, or the
transcript that we’re submitting to you * sir?
Q

Either or both.

MR. COLLINS? Well, what's in the record before you:
nothing.

Absolutely nothing.
What’s in the transcript, again there seems to be-some

question as to what’s in the transcript.
carefully.

I read it last night

Grayned, without any question, 'was a member of the

200 people that were going up and down the sidewalk.
Q

Did he make any

MR. COLLINS:

Grayned --

noise?

Thera — to my knowledge — is not

direct —- the testimony is, everybody was chanting? there is
no direct testimony, to my knowledge, that Grayned was chanting.
This was a group of 200 people.

There is testimony that he

x?as, I think, demonstrating or raising his hand.
Q

How was he convicted?

MR. COLLINS: Because the anti-noise, anti-picketing
— anti-demonstration ordinance says:

whosoever shall

wilfully make noise or demonstrate as to disrupt the classroom.
It reads:

’’Who shall wilfully make or assist in the making

of any noise or diversion which tends — which disturbs or
tends to disturb the peace and good order of such school session
or class thereof."
Q

What did he do?

MR. COLLINS: There was testimony that Grayned, this

■one particular defendant,, was walking up and down.
seme people said he had a sign, some didn't*

X believe

There was

testimony that everybody was chanting. And of course there was
testimony by various school teachers that things sort of
stopped inside for a long period once this started.
Q

Well, what — I assume that if the testimony was

that everybody was chanting, a man who was in that group who
was deaf and dumb could get convicted under this statute —
ordinance, 1 mean?
MR. COLLINS: Deaf and dumb?

I doubt that he’d be

convicted, if he showed that, he -Q

But he'd be arrested.

MR. COLLINS:
Q

— couldn't — if he was dumb —

Isn't it a.fact that the way this statute was

administered in this particular case was that anybody in that
group was subject to arrest?
MR. COLLINS:

I think not.

If we read the record,

and now we're talking about the transcript not the record before
this Court —
Q

Well, I'm talking about this

MR. COLLINS:
0

— Grayned —

We have one man here before us, don't we?

MR. COLLINS:

You have one man and you have an

ordinance.

Q

And I'd still, just personally for myself, I don't

45
see what he has been proved to have done to violate the
ordinance, even if it’s constitutional»
MR» COLLINS*

Vote see my trouble?

Yes, I understand»

If we get into trying the facts of this case, which,
incidentally, took two whole days to try, there is controverted
testimony, first»

Mr. Grayned said, raX just happened to be

there, and fch© police came along and put me in" ~~ and this,
and all of the testimony is controverted.

I’m speaking about

the City’s testimony, and the two verdicts of the jury.
The jury found, one, that the plaintiff was guilty
of the anti-picketing? two, they found him guilty of making a
diversion, not a noise.
Q

How does Illinois define "diversion5’?

MR. COLLINS* The Supreme Court of Illinois — this
was brought up there — now, this isn’t just a diversion, if
the Court pleas©, but it is a diversion’Vilfully make or
assist in the making of any diversion which tends

disturbs

or tends to disturb the peace and good order of such school
while it is in session.”
That’s how the ordinance reads.
i

As to the definition of "diversion”, X believe the
Illinois Supreme Court took that up specifically, the word
itself, and I hope I can find it immediately — or I’m in
trouble hereI
It said*

We do observe, while the defendant charges

that the terras appearing in the ordinance, such as noige and
diversion —- I'ra reading from the Illinois Supreme Court opinion
— lack constitutional precision and are too indefinite,
terms such as alrm, disturb, interfere with, and hinder have
been determined to comply with the Constitutional requirements
of specificity»
The terras here are not constitutionally objectionable»
Q

I suppose the jury was instructed?

MR. COLLINS: The jury wa3 instructed -—
Q

How were they instructed?

MR. COLLINS:

— on the words of the ordinance,

I don’t think they were instructed on a dictionary definition
of diversion.

It occurs to me, though, however, a diversion:

to divert, to take from the normal course, where you have
testimony that a good part of the students spent most of the
day looking out the windows instead of studying, I think
diversion in the context of this ordinance is they were
diverted from the usual procedure that goes on in school?
namely, learning and teaching, I assume.
Q

Did the defendant make any request for charge

in the trial court on the meaning of diversion?
MR. COLLINS:

The colloquy concerning instructions

are in this transcript.
Q

No point was raised --

MR. COLLINS:

And there's no point, that I know of.

47
I didn't r®ad —
Q

And not raised in the Supreme Court of Illinois

on that, X suppose?
MR, COLLINS;

Nor in the magistrate's court.

However, X didn't try the case.

But it does not appear here.

And there does appear in this transcript the discussion
concerning instructions to foe submitted to the jury.
So probably it didn’t occur.

At least it wasn’t

reported.

Now X see my time is almost expired.
It seems to me basically that the Rockford ordinances
do not differ greatly from the ordinance in the second Cox
case.

Both ordinances,
They’re specific as to place.

definite, and, incidentally, reasonable.

150 feet is quite
15 feet wouldn’t

help much, and 1500 feet probably would be too far,
They’re specific as to time.

Incidentally, the anti­

noise, anti-diversion ordinance says ground adjacent to the
school.

The school property, not the building. The picketing

ordinance, the measurement starts at the building not vat the
property.
Especially these are specific, I think, as ordinances
/

can foe.

From the standpoint of time,they’re both restricted,

as to — a little different, however — the picketing ordinance,
a half hour before and after school is in session? the anti-

48
noise and diversion ordinance, while school is in session, or,
if they have a meeting, any time during the day or night when
a meeting is being held in the school house,
Q

Well, what interests beyond noise and diversion

— what interests beyond protection against noise and diversion
does the anti-picketing ordinance protect against?
MR. COLLINS;

None.

X think that the — and in the

preamble of the anti-noise ordinance, it’s for the protection
©f schools, so that the educational process will continue
uninterrupted.

That's the rationale of both ordinances,

tod they were passed just for that purpose, and for no other
purpose.
I believe my time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. COLLINS;

Thank you.

I thank you very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
