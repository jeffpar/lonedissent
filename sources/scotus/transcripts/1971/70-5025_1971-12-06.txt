No. 5025» Haines against Kerner.
Mr. Bass, you may proceed whenever you’re ready,.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. BASS, ESQ*,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BASSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court t
This case is here on certiorari to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed the
dismissal of a pro se action brought by an Illinois prisoner
against prison officials and others under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983p
seeking damages and other relief for injuries resulting from
allegedly unconstitutional disciplinary treatment.
The District Court granted the respondent official's
motion to dismiss, without allowing leave to amend or to
amplify, without directing an answer from the defendant, without
allowing discovery, without appointing counsel or same other
person to assist the petitioner, and without conducting any
hearing.
The facts are basically as follows*
In 1968, Haines, who liras then 56 years old, was an
inmate of the Illinois State Penitentiary, serving a life sentence
imposed for burglary, as an habitual offender, which was imposed
in 1939

Q

Where was he, at Statesville or —*

HR» BASS:
Q

He was in Menard»

Menard»

MR* BASS:

At the time he had a foot disability, for

which he had been awarded compensation by the Illinois
Industrial Commission.
On March 10 of 1968, Haines, while on work detail,
was threatened by two younger inmates about 30 years old»
Statements were made by the other inmates to- the effect 'that
'the “young blood” was taking over and that the “old blood.fJ * like
Haines, was '’done",
Haines did not immediately react to these taunts, but
obtained an inmate pass to go outside and inspect a pile of
cinders.

When Haines re»entered the shack, the two younger

inmates resumed their argument and their threats, stating that.
Haines had better watch out or he would be hurt.

Again Haines

did not react»
After Haines entered th© bathroom

,t

these other inmates

approached him in a threatening manner and resumed the argument»
One of the two men asked him if he wanted to start something,
he thinks it was Doherty, and Haines then hit Doherty with a
shovel.

Subsequently there was a scuffle with Mr. Moore, and

after that Mr. Haines way taken by one of th© officials of the
prison to the solitary confinement.
Some time after that, which is not clear from the

5
complaint, Mr» Haines was taken by the defendant Rogers to the
disciplinary officer»

Mr» Haines refused to explain his

actions, other than fee acknowledge he had hit Doherty with the
shovel»
He was locked again In an isolation cell until a
report could be had from the defendant Duncan,

Socks time after

that., it "a also not clear how long a period this was, the report
was submitted to the disciplinary committee.

At that time

Haines was brought before them, and objected to certain state®
ments regarding his hitting the shovel on the floor,

Haines

had indicated that he had dislodged some dirt from the shovel.
And the defendant Lonce wanted to know why plaintiff
would hit Doherty and stated it had been 28 years since Haines
had been in the "hole”*
khan plaintiff refused to talk to these officers, he
was given 15 days’ punishment in solitary, from March 10 to
March 25, 19S8,

'

Mr» Haines described somewhat the conditions of the
solitary. . He says that it was a dark cell, that he had no
bod or mattress, that he had to sleep on the floor on blankets,
that he had received just one regular meal during the afternoon
arid some broad in the morning and evening, that there were no
personal articles of hygiene, specifically no soap or towel,
and that his falso teeth became so rancid he had to take them
out

s
.Following his stay in solitary confinement* Mr. Haines
was demoted to Kc" grade* which meant that he lost certain
commissary privileges and other privileges which Haines said
are not known to him, although in discovery Haines filed
numerous requests for admissions and interrogatories* Where ha
sought to ascertain more information along that line,»
The issues .in the case are* first, whether or riot the
District Court prematurely dismissed the complaint*
•v

*

Secondly,

.

whether the totality of the circumstances of this particular
solitary confinement, as applies to this particular inmate,
unjustified .on this record, violated Haines* right to be free
from cruel and unusual punishment*

Third, whether Haines was

effectively precluded from making a defense, a self-defense*
t

w

at the disciplinary proceeding.

&ndf finally, there’s a question

of whether or, not Haines was penalized for exercising his
right to remain silent until the existence of any immunity was
fairly demonstrated to him.
The issues that are not involved in this case are a
general attack upon solitary confinement, per se, under humane
conditionst and, secondly* whether or not the application of
Goldberg.vs. Kelly type of procedures apply to all disciplinary
proceedings*

We deal in this situation with a specific problem

where a man is charged with a prosecutable offense where, the selfincrimination question must be dealt with.
Q

Mr. Bass*

just a little curious.

Does the

?
record show what happened to Doherty and Moore?
MR* BASS s

The record does not show what happened to

Doherty and Moore in terms of whether or not they were punished
or prosecuted, nor does the record show if Haines was ever
prosecuted*

X believe he was not*

The principles applicable to this ««»
Q

Do you know?

MR* BASSs

X don't Know.

Well, X do Know that ha was

not prosecuted, from talking to Mr* Haines*

But I don't

know about the other two- individuals,
The principles applicable to the Eighth Amendment
claim are well stated in Jackson vs* Bishop, in opinion by Mr*
Justice Blacksaun, then Circuit Judge*
Q

You said 'there had been no hearing in this case?

ME* BASS :

We said 'that there was a disciplinary

MR. BASS 2

“« on -the motion of the defendant to

dismiss«
Q

So there's no evidence on which we ear?, assess the

cruel and unusual punishment claim?
MR. BASSs

The only thing we have, the allegations

3

of the complaint, which are taken as true for the present
purposes. Which saiast be liberally construed in accordance with#
pro ss pleading rules.
Quoting .from the Suprema Court pronouncements in
<

Jackson vs. Bishop, Mr. Justice BXactamm pointed out that the
meaning of the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity
«

of man that is the flexible guarantee drawing meaning from the
evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a
maturing society.

Wanton infliction of pain and unnecessary

cruelty are barred.
Significantly, a statement is made there that broad
and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilised standard©,
humanity and decency' are youthful and usable.
And, as we point out, the practices of other
jurisdictions, standards of the American Correctional Association,
the United Nations minimum standards, and the views of experts
show that these concepts are also practical and workable,
•This Court has not hesitated to strike down State
penal practices which contravene federal constitutional
guarantees, Younger vs« Gilmore, Crews vs. Howe, Johnson vs,
Avery, Cooper vs, Pate, and La© vs, Washington*

3meUMnmvatSm0tmBHtmtemh !C/Tii-.s.vjyUii»

*»

t«acei*aK«r»MorcT,«hcuoccjx**>« AaouiaCMBa»

All involve

cases where State penal practices were held to be inconsistent
with the federal constitution*
It appears that the respondent® do fall back to the
position that the action taken here was actually necessary to

9

toe maintenance of prison discipline and security.

But,

interestingly, there is no evidence in this record to support
•that conclusion.

And that is another reason why the case

needs to be remanded.
They suggest possible abuse of facilities by a
person in solitary confinement„ as an abstract possibility.
But nowhere is it suggested, as the Second Circuit pointed
out in Wright vs. McMann, that a determination had been made
administratively, that Haines was a person that would have abused
those facilities.

Accordingly, the case must be remanded to

ascertain whether or not such a determination had ever been
made.
And it should b® noted in this connection that there
are alternatives to the type of punishment that was imposed
upon Haines.

This would be entitled to some weight in

determining whether or not the inflictions in this case were
actually necessary for prison discipline.
As the President’s Crime Commission pointed out in
1967, one of the things that could be done in a situation
i

involving misbehavior is that the inmate should be contacted
by members of the staff concerned with his classification and
counseling, which could include chaplains, caseworkers, and
persons of that sort.

They should discuss with him the causes

and consequences of his misbehavior, trying to reach agreement
on what the causes are, and how they may bo corrected.

So that

10
instead of blindly imposing a subtle or not so subtle form of
corporal punishment. they ought to try to get through to the
man5s mind and find out why his attitudes are the way they are*,
In this case, it is quite possible they would have finally
ascertained that Haines was reacting in self-defense and was
not the aggressor.
And, as we find from some of the returns to our
questionnaire from some of the Departments of Corrections,
many persons are saying "we «se solitary confinement only as a
las.t resort, when other alternatives are not availing."
Perhaps one approach that
Q

Weil, will you clarify for roe, Mr. Bass, I'm

a little confused by something you've just said.

What

happened when they undertook to make an inquiry into the
incident of hitting the other prisoner over the head with the
shovel?
MR. BASSt Well, he refused to explain his actions.
I'll get to that in a moment as to why.

He was effectively

precluded from talking about self-defense at that point.
That's the second point, involving due process.
With respect to the first point, perhaps the best
approach would be for this Court to adopt the'procedure
utilised in the Eastern District of Arkansas with respect
to the whipping cases.

The first case, Talley, vs. Stephens

held that there must foe procedural safeguards surrounding the

11
infliction of corporal punishment in order to minimice abuse.
Interestingly, none are shown here.

That is, we do

not know whether or not the Illinois regulations requiring a
doctor to certify that a person is fit to take certain types
(

of. confinemento

There is no showing that there’s administratis;

review over lower

echelon personnel, nor is there any showing

that Haines3 physical condition was given any weight whatsoever
in the determination that fee should be subjected to this type
of punishment.
Of course, this is a determination for the prison
officials, -not the courts, to make,

However, there is no

showing that the prison officials made such an informed showing
on this record, and therefore the case must foe» remanded,
as the Fourth Circuit pointed out in Brown vs, Peyton,
while the judgment of prison officials are entitled to consider­
able weight, prison officials are not judges and not charged
with the responsibility of enforcing the Constitution, and they
ar© not always disinterested parsons.

We do not denigrate their

views, but cannot be absolutely bound by thorn,
The second, approach that might be taken would be to
hold, as .in Jackson, vs,. Bishop, that there are such practices
that so contravene civilised standards as to constitute cruel
and unusual punishment per se.
For ©sample, there is no showing at all that any
legitimate interest is served by keeping people in dark calls?

12
nor is there any showing that persons couldn't be loaned personal
articles of hygiene,

which would than be returned back to the

officials, so that a parson would not be able to make weapons
of rasor blades, or things of that sort.

Nor is there any

showing that it’s impossible to construct a bed that cannot be
taken apart by a prisoner.

Nor is there a showing that it's

impossible to have medical visitation, or to have exercise.
So we think that a remand should be held in this
case in order to fully develop the record as to exactly what
alternatives are available to the State, and whether or not
the inflictions in this case were absolutely necessary.
We're not seeking final judgment here, but only a
chance to prove that Heines was in effect treated as rubbish.
The second claim, which is the procedural due process
claim is as follows*
Mr. Haines points out that no statement of reasons
was ever given for the punishment, and there’s the chance that
he may have been penalised for exercising his right to remain
silent.
He was in the dilemma of talking and possibly
incriminating himself or not talking and thereby suffering
punishment,
As we've pointed out, this -~
Q

Of course , fee was — the fact that no reasons

were given for the punishment really doesn't make this case

.

13
very unusual.

That's the general rule in an ordinary criminal

prosecution after a conviction.

The sentencing judge, quite

often, doesn’t give reasons why he imposes one sentence rather
than another.

Isn’t -that true?

MR. BASS; Well, I was leading to another point, Mr.
Justice Stewart.
Q

And that is —•

And 1 thought your procedural due process claim

was different.
MR. BASS;

—• the extent to which the federal court

might defer to administrative determination, which are based
upon sound procedural basis, then if may be that if it can
be shown that there were a statement of reasons, that there
ware adequate procedures.

The federal courts might then not

undertake to review every single situation.
But what we have here is a situation where no reasons
were given, without any explanation as to whether or not that
would have been impossible.
Actually, many prison officials now do give reasons
for punishment.
Q

You mean give reasons why they impose ter? days

in solitary confinement rather than twelve, or rather than
eight?
MR. BASS;
Q

I believe some of them --

If so, this makes this much different from the

ordinary criminal process, where, in those States where juries

14
set the punishment, no reason is ever given, or ascertainable,
and in -those jurisdictions where the federal judge, or where
the judge in the federal system, or in the State systems, where
the judge imposes the punishment, he quite typically doesn't
give reasons why he imposes the sentence of two years rather
than two and a half or three, rather than one and a half.
ME. BASS; Well, the alternative —
Q

Isn't that true?

ME. BAGS;

—- to no reasons is that the federal

courts will then have to fish into the cases to determine
what the reasons were.
Q

Why?

HR. BASS %

In order to ascertain whether or not there

was an. impermissible basis of punishment.

If he was penalized

for talcing the Fifth Amendment, that would be an illegitimate
basis -Q

In reviewing State criminal convictions„ and

federal criminal convictions, this Court and most r©'viewing
courts are entirely without power to look into the punishment,
so long as it’s within permissible limits.

And generally no

reason is given by the one who imposes sentence.
MR. BASS: Well, in the event that the Court does
not require a statement of reasons fos given, it will be
necessary then in individual cases to ascertain exactly what
the basis was..

If an inmate claims that the reason that he

was punished was because he engaged in protected activities,
such as filing writs against the warden —
Q

You mean as to why he was punished at all?

MR. BASS; Why he was punished at all,, or why he
was punished to the extent to which he was punished.
Q

Well, that's the second part, that I don't

understand.
MR. BASS;

We would simply submit that it may be

required by due process and, perhaps more important, it will
enable the federal courts to ascertain whether.or not the ease
does present the constitutional infirmity raised by the
prisoner.
But, in any event, x*re would suggest that the way
that the dilemma that the inmate has can be resolved is
suggested by the District of Columbia Circuit decision in
Kelson vs. Sard.

There there was a man on federal parol© who

was arrested for a now offense.

He sought a continuance of the

federal parole revocation proceeding on the ground he might
incriminate himself.

The Circuit Court said there was no

need for a continuance, because they would adopt an implicit
use immunity rule,saying anything that he said in the revocation
proceeding would be, ipso facto, inadmissible in the criminal

case.
Under those circumstances, that removes the legitimate
fear of self-incrimination.

It has been fairly demonstrated

16
to the prisoner that he has no Fifth Amendment problem.
could then talk.

He

In this situation there is no showing that

Haines knew of any implicit ttsa immunity, nor that he was
advised by this.
Now, the appointment of counsel might suffice, or
simpla admonition by the administrative officials might suffice.
On this record, we certainly cannot presume a waiver that he
intentionally relinquished that right, knowing that he had such
a right? and under fch© circumstances the case must be remanded
for a determination.
In addition, while Haines raised a question as to
whether or not his good time was properly taken away, we think,
candidly, that that issue really is not relevant to this case,
for the following reason;
In Illinois, life prisoners are entitled to be
considered for parole at the end of 20 years, minus good time.
But Haines didn’t need that good time, because his twenty years
were up in 195?,

Therefore, the only question related to his

release is whether or not the parole board might have taken
this disciplinary proceeding into consideration, in denying him
parole in 1968,
For the Court9s information, Mr, Haines, in June of
1971, was paroled effective July 6th, contingent upon acceptance

by a veterans hospital if detainer was not exercised against
him.

But, unfortunately, the veterans hospital has not chosen

17
to accept him, and that is -the problem that /remains to be
worked out.

But he still has a damage claim in this case that

must be resolved»
He doss say that he suffered physical injuries, and
pain and suffering as a result of being in that solitary cell.
And, under the circumstances, he has a clear right, under
Section 1983, under Monroe vs. Pape, to come into this Court
and seek relief.
If there are no further questions, I will save my
remaining time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGBRs Very well, Mr. Bass3,
Mr. Smoot.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN K. SMOOT, ESQ.,
OR BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SMOOT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the

Court? and may it please the Court;
In June of 1968, petitioner filed a pro sa civil
rights complaint in the District Court for the Northern District
of Illinois, Eastern District.

In addition to the facts that

Mr. Bass has already laid out, I would like to add the
additional facts that were presented by the complaint.
Haines was 65 and he was working in the yard gang.
There was a verbal disagreement between himself and other in­
mates.

Ana in response to this verbal disagreement, Haines

struck another inmate over the head with a shovel.

18
This incident was observed by another inmate by the
name of Orlando»

A prison official who was close at hand

came to the incident.

He administered first hand to the

inmate — first aid to the inmate that, .was steendk over the
head with the shovel, then called for the DisciplinaryLieutenant
of the Day.

It’s the procedure at Menard Penitentiary to

walk serious rule infractors to the disciplinary captain.
When Mr. Haines was walked to the disciplinary captain,
he admitted the violation of the serious rule of the penitenti­
ary.

He admitted to the lieutenant that he struck another in­

mate over the head.
In response to this admission, Mr. Haines was placed
in what Menard calls a holding cell.

Mr. Haines calls it

isolation? we’ll accept that as true.
On the same day an investigation took place.

On the

same day, March 10th, 1968, Mr. Haines was given a hearing

in

front of two captains — one was a lieutenant, one was a
captain, who were not involved in the original incident.
The investigation report of the guard who made the investiga­
tion was presented to Mr. Haines.
investigation.

He was confronted with the

He had the opportunity to rebut the investiga­

tion, or, in the alternative, to explain his actions.
He took advantage of that by making what he felt
were minor changes in the investigation report.

In fact, he

said, ’’Well, I didn’t bang the shovel on the yard room floor.

19
as the investigation presents? but I will answer no further
questions.K
Q

Were the prison regulations published and

disseminated among the prison population?
MR. SMOOT:

Yes, Your Honor.

It's the policy of

the penitentiary to place the inmate guidebook in each cell.
And I think it's Rule 19 which prohibits fighting in the
penitentiary, and it also gives the initiates notice that if
fighting does occur,, there will be quick and summary punishment,
including potentially isolation and revocation of good time.
Q

Is that Rule 19, or is the guidebook —

MR. SMOOT:
Honor.

It's in tbs respondents' brief. Your

I don't, have the page at hand.
Q

Yes.

Thank you.

MR. SMOOT:

After the hearing, giving Mr. Haines a.

chance

Q

Excuse me — does the regulation provide for the

hearing?
MR. SMOOT:
Honor.

I don't «— I don't think it does, Your

But it is the policy for the penitentiary to have a

hearing for all serious rule infractions.

Minor rule infractions

such as not standing in line for the count, taking food that's
not authorised, oftentimes the guard will dispose of this
violation on the spot.

But any violations which the prison

considers serious — fighting, stealing, contraband — they

20
will have a hearing in front of an impartial disciplinary
captain»

In this situation there were two»
Q

By impartial, that is someone who is not connected

with the particular incident'?.
MR. SMOOT: That's true, Your Honor.

They are

penitentiary staff, though, in that context.
Only after Haines was given a hearing in front of
these two members who ware not a part of the original
confrontation was there a disposition.

The disposition

resulted in placing Mr. Haines in 15 days in isolation.

He

did have a toilets he slept on the floor with three blankets?
he admitted having one meal a day, plus bread and water in the
morning and in the evening.
He alleged the absence of any personal hygiene
articles, but he specifically noted no towel, no soap.

He

also alleged his false teeth became rancid.
The first issue I'd like to address myself to is
whether the hearing or the procedure in which the penitentiary
disciplined Mr. Haines complied with due process.
The majority of federal circuits who have examined
this problem have concluded that as long as the punishment is
not posed arbitrarily or capriciously,, it comports with due
process.
This Court has stated in several cases that the
fundamental requisite of due process is a meaningful opportunity

to be heard.

The meaningful opportunity to be heard is a

relative concept, depending on the capacity of those to be
heard and the circumstances of the situation.
This Court has also noted that where a specific
proceeding is required, the nature of that proceeding will
depend on the nature of the alleged right involved, the nature
of the proceeding, and the possible burdens inflicted on the
proceeding.
I. think when you look at the facts as pleaded by Haines,
and by the way, I've viewed approximately 800 civil rights
complaints, where I've been working for the Attorney General;
and Mr. Haines was not only articulate pro se litigant, but he
plead his facts well.

He was very specific.

There is no

evidence that Mr. Haines is inarticulate,non-Intelligent, or
incapable of presenting his own complaints.
Haines admitted the rule violation.

He admitted to a

guard ~ there, is no evidence of coercion, - that he hit, struck
another inmate over the head.

He refused to answer any further.

• After an investigation by the guard., being presented
with this investigation, Mr. Haines had the opportunity to rebut
the findings of fact in the investigation or explain his
actions.
He failed to correct any -- the report, or to respond
other than to make minor corrections in the report.

The

disposition occurred only after investigation and a hearing.

22
Q

Mr. Smoot, what was he punished for?

Not

answering the question, or for hitting the man over the head?
MR. SMOOT:

There's no question that the record

supports -chat he ’was punished for the rule infraction.
Q

Well, where is that in the record?

MR. SMOOT:

Well, 1 think it's a reasonable assumption

to male©, that if an inmate strikes another inmate over the
head with a shovel, he admits it to the guard, and there is
investigation, and after they give him the opportunity to
respond to that, they say, "All right, 15 days in" —•
Q

Well, is it possible that he was punished to

not saying he did it?
MR. SMOOT:

Wot in this situation, no, sir.
;

But, even —
Q

Why is it impossible?

MR. SMOOT:

All right.

It could be possible? but

it’s not logical in this situation, that he was punished for
not making «- he already admitted the rule violation, so he
was not cited in this situation.
tion.

He admitted the rule viola­

Even if he was cited, I think it should be permissible

to punish an inmat© for remaining silent.
Q

Oh, you do?

MR. SMOOT:

Yes, sir.

The Fifth Amendment follows the individual into the
penitentiary.

Mo question about that.

But the Fifth Amendment

23
should not permit an inmate to remain silent when he is asked
solely and narrowly questions concerning discipline in the
penitentiary.

Because the inmates are probably one of the solef

or oftentimes the only sole information concerning what^s
going on in the penitentiary.

And X don't think the Fifth

Amendment or the right against selfr-incrimination should
prohibit the penitentiary from disciplining inmates for remaining
silent.
It's not in issue here# and we are not quite surra
what the punishment would foe for remaining silent.

But obviously

it's not logical assumption from the facts in this case that
Mr. Haines was punished for remaining silent.
There's no issue hers of confrontation and crossexamination.

The fasts were not in dispute.

the penitentiary officials wass

The question for

What would be the resolve of

the situation?
There are no complicated-fact situations.

The

credibility of witnesses are not in issue here. There is no
biased evidence, from the statement of the pleading.

So, since

the facts were not in dispute, and there is no evidence of
faulty memory or bias, obviously cross-examination is not
required,
Heines did not ask for any witnesses.

He states in

the complaint that Orlando was a witness? at the time of the
hearing he did not asfc- for inmate Orlando to corns in.

24

It is the policy of the penitentiary to permit inmates to call
other witnesses, if they have any, or, in the alternative,
if the disciplinary captain feels it’s the better practice,
he will go out and have an investigation or write up a report
on the other witnesses and come back and present it to the
inmate who82 objected to the hearing..
The second issue concerns cruel and unusual punish­
ment *

I think equally as important, or maybe even more

important, are 'the facts that Haines dees not allege»

Th©

following facts are not in issue heres
Haines did not allege that there was any absence of
running water? in fact, h© had running water*
had a toilet.

He said he

And the unit in the isolation cell at Menard

only cones with a basin and toilet, they are not separable.
So he had a wash basin" with running water and a toilet.

He

never alleged the absence of running water.
Q

It was the same —* same utensil?

MR * SMOOT;
Q

Same unit, Your Honor, yes, sir.

Was the toilet and th© wash basin?

MR. SMOOT?

Yes, they’re one unit? they’re installed.

They war© installed in I960, prior to his incarceration.
Mr* Haines doss not allege the absence of any shower

In fact, it's the policy of Menard Penitentiary to

give inmates a shower once a week and a shave while in
isolation.

He never alleged he didn’t have a. shower.

25

Q

Well, now, you say that5s the policy,

You're

just telling us that.
ME, SMOOTi

That's right. Your Honor,

For your

information.
Q

If there were a hearing, 1 take it that's the

sort of thing that would develop at a hearing.
MR. SMOOT:

I think the logical implication for requiring a hearing

is that you are assuming the penitentiary has done something
wrong and you're making them prove up that they didn't do
anything wrong.
Q

I think the proper posture —
I don't understand where that fails.

MR. SMOOT:
Q

Okay,

If X may complete ~~

Okay.

MR, SMOOT:

I think the proper posture here ia when

you have a complaint.

Evers if it's pro se.

The rule says

that ~~ a liberal construction: must give the inmate a liberal
construction.

Rut this does not mean that you plead facts for

the individual that may or may not state a cause of action.
You rule, you givs the appropriate remedy? that's all liberal
construction says.

That the federal courts should provide the.

inmate a remedy, notwithstanding if he says habeas corpus and
it's really civil rights, or vice versa? the federal court
should apply liberality there.

But not plead facts for the

26
And Mr. Haines was very specific throughout his
complaint.

Concerning the allegation he mentioned the

individuals' names and the dates.

I think it's logical to

assume that if he didn't have running water or he didn't have
showers, or he didn’t have adequate heat or ventilation, he'd
have brought these out in his complaint.

And 1 think it's

improper for the federal court to assume the absence of these,
hold a hearing, and. then require the State to prove that he had.
I think it’s fair to both parties, and you're not
doing an injustice to the liberal construction, to require the
federal courts to merely rule on the facts as pleaded.
And 1 think what's logical here is to show the facts that were
not pleaded, to balance off against the facts that werec in
concluding whether, under the total circumstances, the incar­
ceration of Haines was cruel and unusual punishment.

There is no inadequate heat or ventilation in this
case.

There was no inadequate medical attention.

no permanent physical discomfort.

He alleges

He says h© had circulation

problems at that time.
Absent his specific allegation that ha had no towel or
soap, ha alleges no unsanitary conditions.

So he has a

situation in which you have IS days, that's the maximum time an
individual can spend in isolation at Menard Penitentiary; in
every penitentiary in Illinois.
He had toilet; he had running ’water

That8s the maximum consecutive —

MR. SMOOT* That's right.

And then after 24 hours or so, can he be put in

there for another 15 days’?
MR. SMOOT*
not the procedure.

Yes, I suppose, technically? but it is
Sf he goes out and would strike another

inmate over the head with a shovel or attack him, yes, I think
technically he could be placed back in there.
Q

Back ha could go.

MR. SMOOT*
Q

Yes.

So he could spend 30 out of 31 days, or 60 out

of 62 days, or 240 out cf 244 days in isolation? is that right?
MR. SMOOT:

Technically, yes, Your Honor»

But it’s

not the policy to do that.
Q

Well, it doesn't happen very often, 1 suppose,

but why is it the policy?
MR. SMOOT*
G

That1s right.

Hunh?

MR, SMOOT* The policy is not to do that, but technically
they could, yes.

I guess.

As the rules are interpreted right

now.

May I ask, Mr. Smoot, this volume of photographs,

is that the State's Appendix?

MR. SMOOTi
Q

The respondent’s,

And it was in evidence, was it, below?

MR. SMOOT:

Yes, it isYour Honor.

Ho, it wasn’t.

It was not in evidence

But X think it5s a legitimate response for the

respondent to show the courts what other jurisdictions are
doing.
Q

Well, I gather, you have included, have you not,

a photograph of the isolation cell at Menard?
MR. SMOOT:
Q

That’s the last section.

This is it?

MR. SMOOTs
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

X notice this ors©.

This, X gather, is the toilet

and wash basin that you referred to?
MR. SMOOT:
Q

That’s right.

There's a mattress in front here.

MR. SMOOT:

Yes.

after Haines was in there.
Q

That came approximately six months
They have mattresses now, but *—

So it doesn’t show what the cell was like when

Haines was occupying it.
MR. SMOOT;

If you remove idle mattress, that's what

the cell was like.
All right.

On the basis of ;the facts as presented,

there are clearly two issues under the Eighth Amendments
Was the penalty disproportionate and/or was the
implementation unnecessarily painful?

29
This Court has listed four factors in determining
whether pur.islur.ent is cruel and unusual.

They’ve looked at the

history of the similar or same punishments.

They’ve compared

what other jurisdictions are doing in similar situations.
They’ve looked at the case law and finally they have used
contemporary standards of decency.
Under all four tests , the present punishment was not
cruel and unusual.
There’s no question that in the 1780's, when the
Eighth Amendment — the 1780*s, when the Eighth Amendment was
enacted, the use of isolation, silence, and hard labor was the
Quaker's humane alternative to the former sanguinary punish­
ment.
The Walnut. Street Prison initially started using
isolation 1/20th to 1/2 of the confinement of individuals who
ware sentenced to death,
Mow, subsequently, the different penitentiaries
throughout the country in the early 17805 s found that prolonged
use of isolation was detrimental to the health of the individua
So they discontinued the continual use of isolation.

But up

to 1840, in both the Auburn Penitentiary System and the
Pennsylvania Penitentiary System, which were the two main
penitentiary systems in the 1830’s and '40’s, isolation was
continually used for part of the sentence for serious violators
of the criminal law, and also for the punishment.

30
In fact, John Howard, who is the father of all
penological reform, in the early 1770‘s, suggested the use of
isolation for serious rule infractions.
There's no question that historically the framers of
the Eighth Amendment did not intend that this type of punishment
should foe circumscribed by the cruel and unusual clausa.
The Court may take judicial notice of many of the
federal courts' opinione.

Isolation is the common measure far

discipline in penitentiaries throughout the country.
Now, the Court should foe careful, because not all
jurisdictions use the term "solitaryK or "isolation”.
may have a different term, but the effect is the same.

They
Whether

you call it administrative segregation.or you called it
corrective measures, or a holding cell, the removal ~>
Q

Or the "hole",

HR. SMOOTi

Or the "hole", yes.

But I think the \ise

of the term, "the hole” is such a derogatory one that it kind of
begs the question in this type of situation.
But every jurisdiction, to my knowledge, uses some
form of isolation in punishing individuals.
The case law — there's a multitude of cases, and
respondent has noted these in the notes, and they are suffici­
ently laid out in the brief, and I'm not going to mention them
here.

But there are common denominators that the federal

courts have come up with in determining whether confinement is

31
cruel and unusual punishment.
The common denominator involves prolonged nudity.
There is no evidence here that there5s prolonged nudity.

Over­

crowding.

Haines was in the cell by himself*

Unjustified

beatings.

So allegation that h© was physically confronted in

any manner.
Inadequate food or water.

There's no evidence here.

I * 11 address myself to how he was given adegu&fc®
food and water under the contemporary standards.
There4s no allegation of ^adequate heat or ventila­
tion.

There's no allegation of

• .-.adequate medical treatment.

He makes no claim.
Q

You mean of inadequate.

MR. SMOOT;
Q

Inadequate, yes, Your Honor.

1 suppose you mean that.

MR. SMOOT;

That's right.

There is no allegation of

inadequate medical treatment.
Q

Or of inadequate heat or ventilation?

MR. SMOOT; That's right, Your Honor.

I apologise

if X said the opposite.
He makes no allegation that it was unclean.

In fact,

they keep these cells very clean»
And the fourth — and the eighth common denominator
was excessive confinement, in light of the conditions that were
involved.

32
None of these are evident»
The final factor, and I think this is particularly
relevant here , if we apply contemporary standards of decency —
a rather vague term, but I think wa can place it into more.
specific context.

If we look at the American Association

the

Many of the

penitentiaries follow this as their penological guide»

They

primary functions of the penitentiary.

You should have a toilet and wash basin, but

they observe that not all isolation cells need a toilet and
wash basin, because ites been their experience that certain
inmates, for causes unknown or causes known, will go in and
break things up.

They will tear up toilets, they will stuff

towels down the toilet seat, there will be an overflow? they
will burn the mattresses.
They may be on a restricted diet.

it shall not be wholly dark.

It has to be

They observe, well, they acknowledge
Well-heated and ventilated.

33
If we take © look afc the situation, we will observe
that the prison really had no viable alternative than to use
isolation.
And I think the Court should keep in mind that when
you are comparing whether this isolation, or the "hole", whatever
terminology you use, is cruel and unusual, it's not logical to
compare the confinement to your bedroom or living room at home.
It should he a relative comparison. These individuals are in a
penitentiary.

By definition, punishment must be somewhat

derogatory.
So if you place an individual in isolation, it has to
be a little more severe than the normal coming and going that
he has in the prison cells, or it’s not effectiva.
Q

Do you have any comment about the false teeth
/

/

allegation?
MR* SMOOT:

Yes, I have, Your Honor.

It3s true.

We must accept as true that his false teeth became rancid.
But. it’s due to his own shortcomings.

He had running water,

p

-and he had false teeth and he could remove them from his mouth?
and X don't find that particularly inhumane to require a,.man to
remove his false teeth from his mouth and wash it underneath
the running water.
Concerning the towel and soap, he had showers, or he
didn*t

* at least it's not in issue here whether he did have

a shower*

And a shower once a week and a shave, that means he

34

,

had had two showers and two shaves doesn’t make the absence
of a towel or soap cruel and unusual punishment in my
estimation.

Especially -- I think the test here is reasonable.

The penitentiary has 1200 inmates in there, and 1 think
it's reasonable for the penitentiary to set up a situation which,
will meet the average individual.
over the head with a shovel,
He x*as healthy.

Haines hit another inmate

There's some evidence of violence.

He was working in the yard gang with pick and

shovel.
At the hearing the disciplinary captains had the
opportunity to observe his physical demeanor.

So x^hen they

placed the inmate in there without towel and soap, I think it's
reasonable to conclude that in the — that could be used as a
gsrrot.

They could place the soap in the towelr and that’s a

very effective blackjack.
So when you compare the interest of the penitentiary
to prevent their guards from serious attack, at the same time
determining whether or not he was submitted to inhumane punishmeat, 1 think the opportunity that he has a shower doesn't
convert the mere absence of towel and soap to cruel and unusual
punishment.

Especially when he is provided with adequate food.

two are reasonable.

So I think it's logical to say isolation.

Wow, -the

question for this Court to answer rwas the implementation of
isolation reasonable?
I think whan you compare the requirements of
discipline, the requirements of the penitentiary for custody
and security, when you balance that against fairness to the
individual, I believe the answer is that this was not cruel
and unusual punishment.

Even though you personally may

disagree with what happened, X don't believe, and the courts
have not so found, that that's the test.
Most recent penological advancements are not the test
in this situation.

The fact that there was other alternatives

doesn’t make this cruel and unusual, because within an area the
prison should have discretion to apply what they feel is
appropriate in a situation.
I think, in summary and in conclusion, I submit that

about that.

No question

And he received punishment that was only a workable

human© alternative available to the prison authorities under the
circumstances.

petitioner’s complaint.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP STANLEY A. BASS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, BASS:

Yes, Mr, Chief Justice.

The respondents are asking this Court to act as a
trial court by bringing in exhibits and by making certain
statements about policies.

Our position is that the case

shoud.l be remanded so that a full record can be made in the
trial court»
Secondly, it's our position that the State does not
have a right to jeopard!go inmate health without showing
necessity and without showing some reliable procedural safe­
guards ,
It's not irrelevant to note the effect upon any
potential rehabilitation, as the Court, in Jackson vs. Bishop,
pointed out, when an inmate receives cruel and unusual punish­
ment it makes it much more difficult to socialise him.
The final remark is that with respect to such questions
as shave and shower, Haines did allege "There was no articles
of hygiene furnished him", and it would seem to me, under-a
liberal construction, that one might then put the burden on
the State to come forward and say exactly what you did supply
him.
And under the circumstances,, we feel that the record
must be developed more fully, and the case should be remanded
to the District Court
