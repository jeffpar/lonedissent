MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

W© will hear airgumj&ntte

You may proceed, Mr. Scholl.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. SCHOLL, 8SQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, SCHOLL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pieac-s tl-.©

Court?
This is a case instituted by 38 named plaintiffs in
behalf of a class of ell persons in Pennsylvania, who had
signed contracts containing confession of judgment clauses.
X will refer to the appellants in discussing this case as the
consumers, since they are all consumers; arid the appellees as
the creditors.
1 would also like permission to request that five
minutes of my time be reserved for rebuttal.
The Pennsylvania State — we have a law in
Pennsylvania that permitted,and in fact did, in the case of
these 38 named consumers, th® prothonotary, who is merely a
court clerk, to ministerially enter judgments against the
consumers without their having had any notice nor opportunity
t.o foe heard prior to the entry of that judgment.
Now, the reason that -- the only thing that authorised
fch© prothonotary to do this, other than the state law, was a
clause which was contained in the contracts that each of the

4
consumers signed.

This clause, of course, is the confession of

judgment clause,
Arid I think that there are two significant character­
istics of the confession of judgment clause.
First, it is one of the many clauses that, is buried
in fin© print, in contracte*

It is a difficult cltvte to under­

stand; many attorneys do not understand what the effect of tfco
clans© is .
And I think a second important aspect is that;
confession of judgment clauses are contained in almost every
contract in Pennsylvania in which credit is extended in any
form.

That is to say, loan contracts, retail installment

sale contracts, in leases, there's a confession of judgment in
ejectment, and of course also in mortgage contracts,
Q

You have in Footnote 1 on page 12 of your

brief what you say is the typical wording of such a clause.
MR. SCHOLL;
Q

Yes.

Is there anywhere in the Appendix or .-elsewhere

where wo can see how it looks in print?

Yon just a moment

ago referred to "fin© print".
MR. SCHOLL:

Yes, there is, Your Honor,

There ax®

SO exhibits — actually there are 81 exhibits, 30 of the
exhibits are contracts, so that's —
Q

In the original record?

MR. SCHOLL %

Yes,

They're the contracts that each

of th© named plaintiffs sign-ad —
Q

Yes*

Is there anything here in th© Appendix

that shows'that?

MR. SCHOLL:
this case.

Your Honor, there was no Appendix in

Wa Q

Yon just have the original record?

MR, SCHOLL3
Q

All right*

MR. SCHOLL:
Q

Yes , w© moved that —

— to proceed on the original record,

All right.

Thank you.

But this, th® wording of. a typical one appears ~~

do I get right — in note 1 on page 12 of your brief?
MR. SCHOLL: That is right, Your Honor.,
How, the confession of judgment that th© prothonotary
may enter may foe entered immediately after the contract is
signed.

That is, it can be entered even before 'there is any

allegation of default.

It can foe entered the same day that

tlie contract is executed.
It cannot immediately serve as the basis -for
execution and sale of th® consumer's property.

However, all

that the creditor need do at that point, to execute and sell
the consumer's property, is to file ex parte an aatverm©nt that
the consumer has defaulted.
Wow, what notice does the consumar get of the
proceedings that are occurring against him?

Wall, after the

6
judgment is entered, he*3 required to get. notice of the entry
of the judgment»

However* the property of tha consumer can bss

sold as short a© 20 day® after the notice, of the entry of judg­
ment is given.
Also,, if there is a sale cf tha consumer's real
©state, h©*s given notice that the writ of execution has bean
issued ag&inat this real ©state, and also he's given notice of
the sal® of his property.

However, this is generally by

publication, although there must also be notice by mail, and
•that may be as — the notice by mail may b© as little as ten
days before fch@ property is sold.
Q

In the earlier case ©head of you, 1 asked

counsel if h© thought it would satisfy due process if the
creditor, by informal notice but communicating actual notice,
advised the debtor that he intended to exorcise the' powers
/

granted under the confession ©£ judgment clause; do you a&»e©

i

\

that that would satisfy du® process?
MR. SCHOLL:

Well, I think

'

if it would b© noticed,

that the consumer would have ®n opportunity end a hearing to
raise any defense that h® might have befo .
could proceed on the confessed judgment, then I think that it
would comport with du® process*
Of course, that is not what is assured by the
Pennsylvania confession of judgment statutes and rules*
0

In other words, under your statute, even if he

7
had notice and earns iar h© would not be able to put in any
defenses; is that true?
MR. SCHOLL: That's right*

There is really only one

procedure by which the consumar can possibly stop the sale of
his property, and that is by petitioning to open or to strike
the judgment*
Wow, what happens whan son®one petitions to open oxstrike the judgment?
Q

Mr, Scholl, you mean the consumer gets notice

that on Monday of next week "we're going to file confession of
judgment against you“?
MR, SCHOLLs

No, he doesn't receive that notice*

Ha never receives any notice prior to the entry of th©
confessed judgment.
Q

Well, I'm adding to the hypothetical the Chief

Justic© gave you,
MR, SCHOLL:
0

Oh, I3m sorry.

r^nd he gets that notice, is it your position that

he can't do anything about it?
MR. SCHOLL:

Th© only thing that he can do is to

petition to open or to strike th© judgment.
Q

But the judgment hasn't been issued yet.

MR. SCHOLL:
Q

Well, the point is that —

Will you get my facts straight, please?

This Monday h© gets a notice which says, "On next Monday, in th®

%

8
Common Pleas Court In Philadelphia, Common xx&m Court No. 257{,
we're going to apply for confession of judgment against yon."
You say that there's nothing he can do.
MR. SCHOLLs

Well, he never g«

hat notice,

no requirement —
Q
could do?

But if h© did get it, isn't; thera something he
You said he couldn't do anything.

MR. SCHOLLs Well, if it's prior to the entry of judg­
ment, he would h® able to go into court and attempt. to enjoin
fch© creditor from obtaining the judgment. That's the only
thing I can conceive of.
Q

Doesn't that fit

that doesn't fit due

process for you?
MR. SCHOLLt

Well, fch® problem is -that.the Peniuiylv&n

procedures do not provide any entry —- or env notice prior to
the entry of judgment.

And in fact I know of no instance, and

certainly it was not the case in any of the named plaintiffs'
cases, in which the notice of — that the judgment was to be
entered was provided to the consumer prior to the entry of
j udgsaent•
q

notice.

My only point was that you say he didns fc have

And I'm saying if h© was given notice, would that be

e.a much dus process q&! you wasted?

Thefe;8 fch® only question X

asked*
MR. SCHOLL:

Well, that would be a different case,

and I think perhaps in that case# dspahding on what the
notice was and what opportunity the consunaer would hava to cc-••• •
in and present his defenses.

S$hat you’re suggesting raay aomo:.^

with due process of law,
Q

Well# if h© did hav® notice# would h© bo

permitted to present breach of warranty defenses# for example#
in Pennsylvania?
MR. SCHOLLs Well# the problem that I have io whcfc he
can do# prior to the entry of judgment.

I think that what Mr*

Justice Marshall was suggesting was that a person would obta;- ©
notice prior to the entry of judgment* and 1 think the only
thing that could possibly b© don© is bringing scata® kind of
injunction action# to prevent the creditor from proceeding.
Q

■

Well# what you’re saying is that; ho couldn't

report to the Common Pleas Court on Monday and say# Now# 1
want to tender evidence in defense of this proposed action.
I want to tender evidence of breach of warranty.
You’re telling us he could not do that as a matter
of procedure?
MR., SCHOLL: That’s correct*

E© could do it but

they would go on and enter it anyway.
Q

He’d have to start# you’re saying# in your view#

some original action to get an injunction, against there being
any proceeding on the judgment a©fca? is that it?

MR. SCHOLLs

That’s the only procedure I can cones!w

10
of.

The prothonotary has .no discretion.

judgment,

K® must enter the

Th® State statute seye that he must enter the

judgment, as long as h© is presented with thr ci^cnm^isr. that
contains a confession of judgment clause in it.
Now, as I have mentioned, there is, -of course, the
procedure to petition to ©pan or to strike the judgment*
However, this is simply a procedure that’s provided in
Pennsylvania, as in most jurisdictions, to obtain relief from
any judgment»

It’s a petition that is directed to the court's

discretion, and the court must be shown —• the consumer must
come forward and show that he- has a meritorious defense besfere
the judgment will be open, and he oven gets an opportunity to
com® in and have a hearing on his motion.
This of course would deny him the right to any jury
trial, to determine whether the defense that he is claiming it
a meritorious defense*
Q
then happens?

Well, suppose the judgment is opened, what
Is there any further proceeding?

MR. SCHOLL:
merits *

Yes. Than there is a hearing on the

The judgment is opened —
Q

Well, what *b the hearing on the merits?

.Does

that involve a jury trial, or what?
MR. SCHOLLs:

Well, then he could obtain a jury trial*

After th® judgment is opened.
Q

And going back to the hypothetical I suggested

11
At that point would he have a jury da termination on his defenses
of breach of warranty?
MR» SCHOLL:

Yes, .ha could have a jury determination

after the judgment is opened# but the problem with the
Pennsylvania procedure is that he must come forward and show
that he has a meritorious defence before a judge, which —
Q

And how does he show that?

MR. SCHOLL:
can.

Well, ha presents whatever evidence h©

Usually he has to proceed by depositions.

And that is

another aspect of confession of judgment# in that the burden
of proof switches, but also that the costs are .increased for

the consumer who must corns forward and present his defenses
through a petition to open or strike, rather than proceeding
in the normal proceeding of answering a complaint.
Q

And he can’t support that merely by affidavit,

he has to take that position, is that it?
H

MR. SCHOLL:

The new confession rules do provide that

he can take testimony#
Q

But suppose he wanted to roly only on

affidavits, then?
ME. SCHOLL:

We11, I suppose he could try it.

He

could proceed, with only affidavits.
But the problem is, of course, that he would not have
a jury trial at that stage, at which it's determined that he
actually has a meritorious defense.

12
Q

As I understand, all that: fas gats %z that," whoths<

it’s affidavit or depositions, is that, the; judgment than is,
open for the purposes of a hearing?
MR. SCHOLL: Thate3 right, Your Honor.
Q

And that may be a hearing at which there may bo

a jury?
MR. SCROLLS
Q

That’s right.

Yes.

MR. SCHOLLs

Mow, the court below recognised -that in

fact the opening and striking procedure did change the burden
of proof, and that it did significantly increase the costs
that the consumer would ordinarily have in the complaint
answer proceeding.

And the court below further declared that

confession of judgment, at least for the class in whose behalf
it held that the action could be maintained, did violate d«s
process of law.
Essentially the court held that since the consular
did not have any notice, nor any opportunity to fa® hoard
prior to the entry of judgment, that therefore ho was denied dus
process of law.
However, the court below did make three exceptions
from the ruling that the consumers urged below.

Below the

consumers urged that the Pennsylvania confession statutes and
rules b@ declared unconstitutional oh their face.
below, instead, declared that£.

The court

yes, it’s unconstitutional for

13
a certain group of people, but Nit11 s not Unconstitutional
regarding three specific classy© of parsons.
Now, the first, class which it excepted was all
persona who earn $10,000 or snore annually,.

For a parson who

earned more than $10,000 a confessed judgment could be entered,
executed, arid serve as a basis for sal© against him.
Secondly, it made an exception for all persons who
signed mortgages, or actually signed confession clauses or
signed bonds and warrants and notes that contained confession
of judgment clauses, which accompanied mortgages.

So thftfe in.

any mortgage transaction, a person could also validly sign a
confession of judgment that would serve as: execution in cals
of his property,
And the third exception that the court made, the
court said that, Well, if at a prior hearing

and although

it didn't set down how the procedure would be carried out —
it could be showed that the consumer voluntarily, knowingly, cnc.
intelligently waived his due process rights, then in that csss,
too, the confessed judgment could be entered and serve as a
basis for execution and sal© of the consumer's property.
Q

Now, incidentally, in this instance we don't have

the forms before us.

But are these all printed forms?

MR. SCHOLL: Which forms are you speaking about?
Q

The one that has the clause at the bottom of

page 12, the confession of judgment clause.

Are they in a

14
printed form*, is what I*m trying feo get atf or what?
MR. SCHOLL:

It's not in s separate printed forni»

What it is is a —* usually it’s one clause in a contract that
contains numerous other clauses.

I think probably the best

reference point for Your Honor would be the exhibits in this
case- they'r®
Q

Well, we don't have them, that*® why I’m asking

you shout it.
MR. SCHOLL$ They should foa —
Q

They’re in the original record, but; w© don’t

have them here,
0

The original record is lodged her®.

Q

But I mean it’s not here on the benchI

MR. SCHOLLz
Q

I think it's her© somewhere.

They're not here on the bench, l can’t see them

before ms, that’s why I’m asking the question.
MR. SCHOLL:
Q

Yes, well, —

Well, what is it, some form of a contract that

an appliance dealer uses, for example, or something like that?
MR. SCHOLL:
contract.

Well, it’s used in practically ©vary

Every contract in Pennsylvania, and where credit

is extended in any form, most ©very contract, retail installment
sale contracts, bonds and warrants with mortgages, ***»

Q

Are they printed

MR. SCHOLL?

— somewhere in there.

G

Ara they printed forms?

MR. SCHOLL:

Yes, they *re printed forms.

Tn fact,

they’re standardised forms, —
Q

That's what I'm trying to find out.

MR. SCHOLL;:

— in fact some of the exhibits that

w©*ve included are simply forms that we got from the local
stationery store.

And they all contain confession of judgment

clauses in the body.
Q

Was there a cross-appeal in this case?

MR. SCHOLL:

Ho, there was no cross-appeal.

The

only party that has appealed are the consumers. ' We*re appealing
from the decision failing to declare confession of judgment
unconstitutional on its face.
Q

Who is Lennox?

ME. SCHOLL:

There's been no cross-eppaal.
Is he a State officer?

Lennox is the — or he was, he's recently

been — well, I guess he still is officially — the Sheriff of
Philadelphia County.

He is the person who has the duty of

executing and selling the property ©£ the consumers*
Q

And Lennox took no cross-appeal?

MR. SCHOLL:

Lennox took no cross-appeal, that is

correct, Your Honor.
Now, 1 think that it's perhaps well to focus on three
exceptions that the court made, and how easily those exceptions
might b© used as a device of circumvention of the entire effect
of 'his® decision below.

16
For instance* the court says that in any cap© wbera
there5s a mortgage md a bond' and warrant anc- not® accompanying
that mortgage* that if the consumer signs that* walls- than you
can confess judgment against him.
Now* the court dees not restrict* however, the
transaction

on a money mortgage.

A mortgage- can in fact b©

taken by a creditor in any transaction.
loan transaction.

It can be taken in *

$he chattel mortgage could b© taken in r,

retail installment sale transaction.

And* in fact* there is

much evidence that this is exactly what was happened in
Philadelphi® County prior to the time that Mr. Justice Brennan
issued a stay order which stopped all executions and sales cm
confessed judgments in Philadelphia County.
The $10*000 and over exception has also been
th-At
circumvented by simply requiring/a borrower file an affidavit
at the time that he takes out a loan or whatever* however-'he's
obtaining credit* that h© earns §10,000 and ever a year.
And it's not surprising that the creditor should hav© the

^

leverage to get the mortgage or to get the affidavit from the
consumer, because* of course, before ho was able to get the
confession of judgment clause* why n©fc just ask the consumer to
sign on® more paper, which in fact has the same effect.
I think there is also a problem with the other
exception that the court, set, the voluntary knowing and
intelligent waiver* a hearing which is to be held.

1?
Tfa© court below sets up no procedure on how this is
to take place.

The way they usually were scheduled in

Philadelphia County after the decision was by petition and
rule to show cause upon, the consumer.

Of course the consumer

gets this petition that, says ha has to cor. a in r A shew that
h© didn’t knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently waive his
rights.

This doss not apprise him of actually what bhe

significances of that hearing is going to he,

The connis-er Ira

never apprized that if it is shown in fact that ha knowingly,
voluntarily, and intelligently waived his rights, that he's
not going to have any hearing on the merits of any dsfennas tbrf.
he might have.
Also the court below focuses in its discussion,
although it says "knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently"
on an understanding waiver by the creditor at tho fcissa that the
contract is signed.
Therefore we have the anomalous results of somebody
who understands the confession of judgment clause and perhaps?
went to a lawyer and asked the lawyer to explain the contract,
that herR signing before h& signed it, he's not excepted from
til® class, because he knows, or h@ understood what confession
of judgment was at the time that he signed it.
The person who doesn't know what it is or perhaps
is not prudent enough to go to a lawyer, h© doesn't under™
standingly waive his rights, therefore he is protected by feh©

is
court's decision,
Q

What's unconstitutional shout some fallow who

knows what h©5s doing waiving his rights?
MR* SCHOLLs SXCUS© IRQ?
y

What's unconstitutional about ecmvaona who knows

what he5 a doing waiving hi© rights?
MR. SCHOLL:

Wall, l think that there is s practical

problem with somebody showing that - somebody ' actually voluntarily,
knowingly, and intelligently waived his rights,

As I will

discus®, X don't think it is possible, but. I think one of the
problems here is; —
y

You mean no on© could understand that?

MR. SCHOLL:

Well, no? 'what l6sn focusing on, Your

Honor, is the notice that the consumar gets,.

All the consumer

gets is notice that.he's going to have a hearing —
Q

Well, letis assume he got the kind of a notice

you wanted, and understood exactly what kind of a hearing was
going to be held, namely, that they're going to go into his
voluntariness and intelligence of his waiver, and that if he
waived, why, he is going to have to ~~ the judgment against
him stands.

Let's assume he got all the notice he wants.

MR. SCHOLL:

Well, if it can ba posited that a person

knew exactly what the significance of that hearing was going
to ba, that would mean he would not b© able to raise any
defenses that he might have,

perhaps this exception might

19
make scan© sense.
But the court, as I said, in the opinion whon they
discussed the waiver hearing, speak only of understanding;
whether the person understood what the clause meant at the
time.

And I idiink that if you look closer at the court's

/halysis of waiver# we s@© that the court did not really
focus on the elements of voluntary, knowing, and intelligent
in its discussion.
The court below says, as a matter of fact, and I
think this is where the court begins to err in its analysis
and I think -this is what led up to the exceptions, if. says ■—
Q

Well, you don't claim, then, as I understand

it, that a voluntary — a knowing and voluntary and intelligent
.waiver is unacceptable constitutionally to dispense with
notice and hearing before a judgment?
MR. SCHOLLs Well, yes, 1 do, Your Honor.

I do

object to that assertion, and the reason that I object to that
assertion is that in a confession of judgment clause what is
in fact being waived is duo process itself.

What somebody is

waiving is any notice or opportunity to be heard prior to a
judgmenfc.
Q

S© you say that nobody should be permitted

constitutionally to waive notice of an entry of judgment?
MR. SCHOLLs
Q

* All rig

That's right, Your Honor.

20

MR., SCHOLL:

Although 1 fchiafc that itss well fco

focus on the elements of voluntary intelligence to see whether
in fact there could be a voluntary sad Intelligent waiver also*
It is also our position that even if you could show that,
there was a voluntary and knowing and intelligent: waiver that,
nevertheless, such a waiver should not be acceptable to this
Court.
Q

I understand.

1 just wanted to get your

Q

What you really want is to shift the burdem of

position,

proof, isn't it?
MR* SCHOLL:

Well, I — what we want to do is

prevent the burden of proof from being shifted.

Ordinarily

in an adversary proceeding when one person comas forward and
attempta to got. the property of another person, h® has the
burden of showing to the court, by a clear preponderance of
th© evidence, that fee's entitled to th© other person's
property.
The Pennsylvania due process •— or confession of
judgment procedure shifts that burden of proof.

The creditor

gets the confessed judgment right in the beginning, and th©
consumer will spend all his time trying to somehow get rid
of that judgment that he has against him? it switches around
the entire adversary proceeding.

And the only way that ha can

do tnis is by coming in and showing fee the court, in a petition

21
to open or strike, that in fact he, by a pur® 'preponderance of
the evidence, has a meritorious defense.,
y

Mr» Scholl, if you prevail here, do you raise

any questions as to the validity of clo&sd and past transactions
in Pennsylvania?

In other words, I'd like a comment from you

on the retrospect!vity feature, if you should prevail.,
MR* SCHOLL:

Well, I think that's a very difficult

question. Your Honor, and I think it's no difficult that the
consumers don’t want to urge for anything that is unreasonable.
I don't think, for instance, that we would urge that, any
judgments that have been entered be expunged.

We would not
«

urge that, in any case.
I think that what we would urge is that there be no
more executions in sales on even the judgments that have been
entered in the past.

That in the future there be no more

entrance of j udgroents*
Now, fchs Land Title Association brief of course ,
raises the issue of retroactivity, and I would like to comment

on what they say, and I think that we actually concur with the
Land Title Association's position, which is that any decision
on entry should not in any sense be retroactive, and that
regarding executions in sales, -that a decision on that be
retroactive only since January the 26th, 1970.

The reason that

I cuoose that date, it. is a date that the Land Title

Associa­

tion indicates that they advised all of their members that they

22
should be careful in the futura ©bout insuring titles on
confessed j augments.
And I think that was a point at which the hardship
factor that may weigh against a fully retroactive decision
sort of changes over, in that it's not at, that point so
important because at that point, the land title associations
were on notice that in fact confession of judgment, probably or
possibly was constitutionally deficient.
I would just like to say © few words about whether the
waiver can ever be voluntary in the confession of judgment
situation.

I think that perhaps the case before this has

highlighted several of the — actually the distinctions here.
What we*re concerned with in this case is a clause
tit at is contained in almost every contract in Pennsylvania,

and the parties that are negotiating here are not two
corporations, they are, in fact, the consumer — who probably
wouldn’t even know what confession of judgment was, much, less
what toe effect of it is — and a company, which uses a standard
form, ana understands, of course, perfectly what confession of
judgment means.
The consumer, in fact, is put in a position where he
either has to sign the contract, that contains the confession
of judgment clause or he hah to do without credit..

He is? put

in a situation, almost the classic adhesion contract situation.
And it’s —

.~3

do

Q
be all right,

Well, you‘re suggesting that the statute might,
as between corporations and understanding people,

but not with respect to consumers?
MR. SCHOLLs

Well, what X 'at suggesting ia that there

is not a voluntary waiver of tins due process rights for tfeo
consumers.

It may be valid.

There may be a voluntary waiver

for some corporations, although in Pennsylvania —
Q

So the statute really isn't — you aren't

suggesting teat it's invalid on its face, then?
MR. SCHOLL;

Well, I think that we are.

Because

there is certainly nothing in the statute that distinguishes
persons who voluntarily waive their rights or corporation® from
individuals.

I think that the statute, as it's drawn, affects

all parsons.
And I think the court, the lower court, could only
have come to the conclusion, "Well, it's sll right for
corporations but it's not all right for individualsM if it
could have found that the statute was in fact severable, and.
that the Legislature would have intended to retain a statute
teat said, "Well, confession of judgment is all right for
corporations, but it’s not all right for consumers".
Q

Well, does the judgment below apply to corpora­

tions under $10,000?
MR. SCHOLLs
Q

No.

In fact, the —

Only to individuals, isn't it?

24
MR. SCHOLL;
Q

It just applies to individuals.

Everything under ten •— incidentally, does the

court suggest -- I've forgotten, it’s been so long since I
read this — what; was the basis of the $10,000 dividing lina?
MR. SCHOLL;

I,think the basis was that we didn't

present to the court any consumers that earned over $10,000.
y

Over 10,000.

MR. SCHOLL;

.

And they felt; that we; had failed to :»eot

our burden of proof on that issue.
They also suggest anothe:

They say that,

Well, maybe these poor people could not adequately represent
the people that earn over $10,000, because those people might
want to retain confession of judgment because, now the*
confession is gone, it might be harder to get credit.
Q

That's right.

MR. SCHOLL;

Well, I think that there's a problem

with that reasoning, and the problem is that the person that's
earning over $.10,000 ha® an income which is security for the
credit.
Q

Well, there was no suggestion that anyone who

earns $10,000 or under is necessarily a poor person?
MR. SCHOLL;

Well, that's true.» too.

There was no

determination made as to either —
Q

It was just that the only proof you had for the

people you represented, were people who earned not more than

25
$10*000, is that it?
MR, SCHOLL:

That's right.-

X think where tha court

erred in that discussion is ass tuning that we had to show, for
©very group of income people, that in fact they were in tha samo
boat, so to speak e as the —
Q

Well, under the judgment below, what is the

standing of the Pennsylvania statute on its face?
MR., SCHOLL:
statute on its face»

Well, they made no decision on the
The statute still retained what the

court said was just as as applied to this group of people who
earn under $18,000 and nonmortgagors.

That group of people is

now going to to® protected from confessed judgments being
entered and executed in certain ~~
Q

Then what is your quarrel with what they did?

MR. SCHOLL:
Q

Well, —

If you don’t represent anybody that makes more

than $10,000.
MR. SCHOLL:

Our quarrel is that we don’t feel there

is any distinction between persons that earn over $10,000 and
those that don't.
Q

In fact, had the court —

Than that may be another case,.

Nobody here is

in that category, is there?
MR. SCHOLL:

Well, on© of the named plaintiffs I

think does earn over $10,000, that is appealing here,
Q

Well, I was referring to your answer to Justice

Brennan. „
MR* SCHOLL;

Mo.

I believe there is on® person that5

appealing that earns over $10,000*

But I will concede that:,

you know, perhaps that is another'case, but I don't think that
what the court should do is built in in its decisions in other
cases»

Q

Well, in any event, I gather that anyi

under $.10,000 is subject to this welvor business, isn't he?
MR. SCHOLL:
Q

After hearing.

MR. SCHOLL:
Q

Yes, a person can -**

Yes, a person can still be —•

Hone of the people you represent has any

protection, unless he can leap that hurdle, is that right?
MR. SCHOLL:

That’s right.

The hearing won’t even

come up unless the parson earns under $10,000 a year.
Q

X know, but. if — but, as I get it, a parson .-

earning under $.10,000 has no protection if in fact it’s
established that he waived these rights? is that right?
MR. SCHOLL:

That’s right.

That's right, there’s a

s

hearing —
Q

That he’s -understanding, intelligent, voluntary,

and all the rest of it?
MR* SCHOLL:

Is that right?
Right.

If that hearing takes place, and

it’s shown *—

Q

Before whom is the hearing to take place?

MR* SCHOLL* Well, tile court doesn’t say that, how
that hearing is to take place.

The way it has been taking

place is by petition and rule in Philadelphia County, which
X don’t think is an adequate substitute *
g

But a creditor who has a — who wants his

judgment, if the person earns less than $10,000, he’s the on®
who has got to initiate it?
MR. SCHOLL;

The eroditor doesn’t.

He has to do something to' have that

hearing,
Q

Before he can go forward on his judgment?

MR. SCHOLL; That’s right.
g

X thought that satisfied you, from youar previous

argument.
MR. SCHOLL;

No.

In fact, in answer to Mr. Justice

Whit®, particularly on that point, we would urge that in fact
what is in question her® is a waiver of the entirety of due
process, it’s a waiver of any notice and opportunity to be
heard prior to the entry of judgment and prior to something
which can lead to"the taking away of a person’s property.
And that such a waiver is simply invalid on its face, because
it’s a waiver of due process, and that is something that this
Court simply cannot permit to take place under our form of

government.
Q

You mean no matter how intelligent and voluntary

end whatnot it is?

MR. SCHOLL: That's right*
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your times is up, Mr.

Scnoll, but. if you'd just answer on© question for me:

Where

did the — briefly if you will *— where did the Court of
Appeals get th© $10,000 figure?
MR. SCHOLL:

It seems that where they got At w&s from

on© piece of evidence that we introduced, a study taken by
Dr. David Caplovitz of the Columbia University Bureau of Applie,
Social .Research in Mew York.

David Caplovitz had studied th$

attitudes of persons who he termed default debtors-: in a study
taken in several cities, on® of which was Philadelphia.

And

on© of the findings that Dr. Caplovitz made was a demography
of the persons that, he had studied.

And he found that only

four percent of these persons earned over $10,000 annually.
Wow, 1 think initially that the reason that this
finding came about was because of th© way be conducted his
study.

1 don’t think that it indicates anything differently

©bout persons earning under $10,000.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank, you, that answers my
question, counsel.
Mr. Patterson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP C. PATTERSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. PATTERSON:

Thank Your Honor.

I represent the Middle Atlantic Finance Association

and 15 member companies who were the Intervening defendants in
this actiono
In view of the shortness of my time» .because Mr.
Mats her© will take ten minutas out from me# 1 will not ask
for rebuttal.
Q

You don't get rebuttal.

MR. Pattersons

Mow, the

to cover is the questions

[Sotto voce]

/

first question I would like

Whether or not a deferred hoaxing#

following judgment# violates due process when every opportunity
is given to the defendant to present every defense h@ has?and
the main contentions that are presented by the plaintiff in
that regard are not that -there is anything inherently wrongful
with having a deferred hearing ©f this sort# but they are
contending teat it is permissible only when there is some over­
riding governmental interest.
ted I'd merely like to point out that the cases
decided by this Court on that subject rebut that argument#
because# for example# the Coffin case# which is cited in our
brief, which was a suit by fch© liquidator of an insolvent
bank against its stockholders, is certainly not a suit on behalf
of th® government; it*s just an ordinary lawsuit between a
bank and stockholders.

And that case specifically held that,

even, though execution was an. assessment which was like a
judgment# and also an execution in issue before any hearing
had been held# and even though a lien was acquired upon th®

stockholders5 stock.
Nevertheless, because the stockholder had a procedural
opportunity under the Georgia procedure to present all defenses,
because he could have a hearing before he was actually daprivsd
of that property# that that complied with due proces?s.
There are many other cases to that effect.

For

example# there’s one case not cited in the brief# Bank, of
Columbia vs. Oakley, decided in 1819, 1? U. S. 233.

Now# that

case held likewise# and also there was a lien# and I won't
burden Your Honors with a description of it# except to say
that there was a statute that provided that any time a note
was payable at a bank# the bank could go ahead and issue
execution and acquire a lien and that then there would still
be a right to a hearing afterwards.
Q

Thor©5® no cross-appeal hare# is there?

MR. PATTERSONs There is no cross-appeal.
Q

However, —

In -the court below# as I understand it# they

hold that there had not been a legal waiver on the part of
any of these people.
MR. PATTERSONs
Q

That is correct# Your Honor.

Is that right?

MR. PATTERSONs That is correct.
Q

Well# where is your case controversy here?

MR. PATTERSON: The controversy is as follows:

The

court below found# mad© a finding of unconstitutionality only

31
as to loans by our clients to consumers with incomes of 1,0,000

or uncter.
q

But there*s nobody hare over $10,000, and there’s

no cross™appeal»
MR» PATTERSON: The plaint! £ XteS here nr@ appealing end
asking the court to extend this decision to people with incomes
ov©r $10,000»

q

well, i understand that.

That doesn't make it

necessarily a css© of controversy»
MR. PATTERSONS Well, because the plaintiffs ar©
trying to — claim to represent people with — consumers with
incomes over $10,000, and because we represent lenders who are
lending money fc© people with over $10,000, it is our position
that we're entitled to argue all constitution a1 questions for
that reason.
And then there's another point
y

Including that the court-, was wrong an people

under 10,000?
MR. PATTERSON;

Exactly ~~ well, including that the

principles that were laid down by the court with respect to
people under $10,000 are wrong as applied to people with
incomes over $10,000.
And on® other point is, and that i© that this question
of waiver has been thrown into the case somewhat belatedly by
the plaintiffs, if you look

at

their jurisdictional statement,

32
they didn't even mention that; -they j'rrk mentioned the $10,000
matter and the mortgage matter»

But wa're perfectly willing to

accede to that expansion*
Now, the main —
Q

l just don't understand this.

If you ware to

prevail on people over 10,000, that issue having been brought
here by the other side who prevailed as to people earning under
10,000, are you suggesting that what w© have to do is reverse
this judgment they won below, even though they lea the appellants?
And you didn't cross-appeal?
MS. PATTERSONS That, Your Honor, is a vary difficult
question.

1 think the precedent, that would be — the important

thing that's going to corns out of this case is the precedent
that will apply to the future.
y

As to which class?

MR.PATTERSON:
Q

And in applying —
The over .10 or under 10?

The over 10.

Then shouldn't we have had soma opportunity to

have reached that question, better than now?
MR. PATTERSONt Well, we have cited in all of our
papers in this Court, and in avan our Motion to Dismiss, we
made it plain that we were arguing all constitutional matters
because of the fact that this appeal had been made as to the
people with over $10,000.

And the precedent that is laid

down on loans to consigners over $10,000 will, as a practical
matter, govern all tssfisactions.

Wall,the appellants bring it up.

MR» PATTERSON; They have brought it up, and we are
controverting their argument»
Q

But by not taking a cross-appeal, doesn't it

follow that you are not, quarreling with that part of the —
with the three-judge court decision, that held this Pennsylvania

MR. PATTERSON:

Well, actually we do —

— with respect fco people under

except when secured by mortgages or except when it could b©
shown that 'they did. this knowingly and intelligently?
q

They’re not going for that.

MR. PATTERSON; Well, tlie truth of the matter is what
happened, and we quarrel with it rightly, but what happened is
the fact, that our clients ran out of money and advised us that
they couldn’t afford to pay for an appeal, so we wrote and
asked for

34

You Ki©an your clients have run out of money?

Q

MS. PATTERSON 8

We wrote and ashed to withdraw ~-

well, at least they so stated.

We wrote and asked to withdraw,

but the Court wrote and stated that we couldn’t withdraw.
Well, couldn't you borrow a. little money from

the;. Pennsylvania Savings and Loan League?

■

"

[Laughter.j
MR. PATTERSON;

Your Honor, if we had been aware

that we were going to stay in the case, w© would have filed an
4

appeal.

And it's very unfortunate that we didn't.

Hut

luckily we can still, as I sea it, raise all these questions
as far as the loans by our clients to consumers with incomes
over $10,000»

And Mr. Mat® hare can certainly raise them as

far as mortgage loans.
May i continuo, Your Honor?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Yes,” go ahead.
MR. PATTERSON;

No, the most important controversy

that appears between ourselves and the plaintiffs is the
plaintiffs' contention that the burden of proof changed, that
the expense changed, and that the notice was not sufficient
as between proceedings to open a confessed judgment on the oh©
hand, and assumpsit actions brought on summons and complaint.
That is absolutely not correct.
First of all, as' far as the burden of proof is
concerned, what the plaintiff has done is to quote to the Court

35
language from the Pennsylvania Supremo Court that applies to
cases that do not involve promissory notes.

They have nothing

to do with this case, because this case involvo» entirely
judgments entered in promissory notes? and mortgage bonds,
which Mr. Mats will handle.
Maw, the Uniform Commercial Code, which w© have oitscl
in our briefs, Section 3-30?(15 ~~
Q

It“a been adopted in Pennsylvania?

MR. PATTERSONs That's correct, Your Honor.
Section 3~307(2), I meastates that the moment a note is
put in evidence, that then, as to all defenses other than that
of forgery, both the burden of going forward with the evidence
and th© burden of proof is on the defendant in an assumpsit
action.

And then of course it's th© same way in a petition to

open.
Th© official comment makes it plain that this isn't
just a matter of th® burden of going forward with th® evidence.
Th® comment makes it plain that this is a matter of th® burden
of proof.
Then, on top of that, the cases have held the
Uniform Commercial Code makes it plain in Section 3-307(1} that
as to forgery the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in an
assumpsit action.

There's a pres wrap ti on of genuineness, but

the moment soma evidence is put in as to forgery, then the
plaintiff has th© burden of proof.

36

Than there is a defense, Yank vs. Eieenibergf, which is
cited in the briefs,, and that case specifically held that in
a confession proceeding the claimant, not the defendant, h&s
th© burden of proof as to forgery.
So there is not one difference in burcan of proof
between a confession case and an assumpsit case.

That's the

first point.
Now, the second point is that as to the expense
factor, there is not one shred of evidence in the record to
the effect that the over-all expense of an assumpsit action is
any less than the over-all expense of a proceeding to open
judgment.

There are no studies, no surveys, no over-all — no

comparisons of over-all figures.
I need say no more than that.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Patterson, if you*r©

using only ten minutes, I think you're now beginning to impinge
on Mr. Mats' time.
Q

Between them.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Are you taking 20 or IQ
for yourself?
MR. PATTERSONS

I'm taking 20.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
thought it was the reverse.
MR. PATTERSON:

Oh, 20.

Excuse me, I

You go ahead.

Oh, I see.

Mr. Mats will take 10.

Now, then, on the question of notice, the question of

37
notice is thoroughly examined in fcha miss, zxid X wosi^t ~*~ it*;:
a very technical matter, and there*® at least 20-■.•days,. ?,-ad
generally many more -days,between the notice of entry' of judgment
and the notice of execution and the time when the sal© can o©
scheduled.
In the case of an assumpsit action, these are 20 days
until a default judgment can be entered, and then on the very
day, or next day, execution can issue.
any difference of burden there.
Q

So -char® really isn’t,

If *~~

Well, let me ask on procedure nows

when a

judgment is entered by confession, a notice goes to th© debtor,
does it?
MR. PATTERSON? The Pennsylvania rules says that
within 20 days after th® notice is entered by confession, a
notice of th© entry of th© judgment and also a notice* of exemp­
tion, when execution is issued, have to be; sent fee the debtor,

Q

Well, what I8ra trying to get at i© this?

Th®

debtor gets that notice how many days before his property my bss
put up for sale?
MR. PATTERSON: Well, first of all, sal© — the next
step is that th® notice of execution has to issue.

Q

That issues when?
\

MR. PATTERSOK ?

That can issus any fcims within 20

days.
iq

Well, can it. issue simultaneously with the notice

38
to tee debtor?
ME. PATTERSONs

Ik?s my understanding that it can.

If it doesn’t issue within 20 days# then it can still issue? but
after that —
Q

Well, how soon may his property be put up for

sal©# from the date of the sending of the notice of the entry
of the judgment?
MR. PATTERSON: Well# in no event can it be put up
mors — sooner than 20 days after the sending of the notice of
execution.

The next point is —
Q

But if that goes out the day that the judgment

is entered# then that's 20 days from the entry of the judgment#
approximately.
MR. PATTERSONs
tions.

Yea„

But there are further restric­

Another restriction is that, sales only take place once,

a month, so it's a very rare case —
Q

Does tills differ by counties in the State?;

MR. PATTERSONS

Well»# in Philadelphia County# I

understand they take placo once a month.

I don’t know about the

other counties,
Then the second point is that the Pennsylvania rules
aay that when it's real estate, there has to be advertising
weekly advertising# for three successive weeks, and it has#
the first ©d has to be at least 21 days before the sal©.
In the case ©£ personal# personalty it's six days.

-So with all these —
Q

Weil, these executions ®:se out of court, they're

not judicial foreclosures?
MR. PATTERSON-:
Q

These are out of court, yen, sir.

Once you issue your notice of execution, in the

case of personalty, what do you do?

Give the —- gome writ of

execution to © sheriff and he gees and seizes the property
or what?
MR.PATTERSON? That's correct, Your Honor.
Q

And then it's sold without any further court

order or anything?
MR. PATTERSON? That's correct, Your Honor.
Q

And so one® you issue the notice of execution

with respect to personalty# there's at least 20 days hue to
©lapse before the sale?
MR. Pattersons

Their handbills have to be posted

and the schedule ~~ the timetable is a little shorter tfa«*re.
The handbills have to be posted and they have to be posted at
least six days ahead of time, in several —
Q

Yes, but. once I send the notice of execution to

the debtor, until than you can't seise the property, I taka it?
MR. PATTERSON:

It can't be seised for 20 more days,-

but then after that —
Q

All right.

All right.

Once you send him the

notice of execution, h© has 20 days before the property can b©

40
seised by the sheriff, right?
MR* P&TTERSOlSs
Q

Well, what about the seizure?

MR, PATTERSONs
Honor.

Before it. can bs sold*

I am not certain about that, Your

I'll aak Mr. M&tz to cover that point.
Q

Well, since we’r© talking about personal

property, an unmortgaged personal property, and you simply got
a lien on it by having a judgment, is that right?
MR. PATTERSON:

You do not get a lien on personal

property by having a judgment.

There are some very misleading

impressions
Q

All right.

All right.

Well, then, you don’t

get a lien, but you have a right to sell, do you?

To seisa

it and sell it; is that right?

M,R. PATTERSONs

Yes,

You can't sell it until you

seise it.
Q

That’s right.

And how soon can you seise it

after he gets notice of execution?
MR. PATTERSON:
days,

Well, he cannot sell it until 20

X do not know —
Q

Twenty days plus six, probably.

MR. PATTERSONs

Yes.

X do not know whether you can

seize it before 20 days or not.
Q

Now, if there is a motion meanwhile, within the

20 days, made to strike the judgment, what happens to all these

procedures on execution and sale?
ME. PATTERSON: Well, then, also it's customary to
ask £©r a stay, and the Pennsylvania rules state they c.ttthorise
the court to grant © stay of execution —
Q

But it*s not automatically stayed?

ME. PATTERSON:

It’s not automatically stayed* the

court —■
Q

You

have to ■— a judge has to rule.

ME. PATTERSONs
Q

Well* I know* but it's not automatically stayed?

MR. PATTERSONs
Q

— generally does so.

No.

It's possible* then* notwithstanding there's a

pending motion to strike the judgment* it's possible* 1 gather*
if the court doesn’t grant a stay* for whatever reason* denies
it, that the property may be sold

on

execution?

MR. PATTERSONS Well* as possible as it might be*
consistently with tha fact that the stays are always granted.
Q

Yes.

Now* one other thing* though.

X take it

non© of *»- of course* none of this happens if you proceed' in
assumpsit* if the creditor proceeds simply ir assumpsit* on the
debt against the debtor* then there has to be no defense and
trial and everything else* and his judgment is never — or hi®
property is never imperiled until after a judgment following
a jury trial or something akin t© it* is that, right?
ME. PATTERSON: Well* Your Honor* yes, except if —-

42
assuming —* in 99 instances out of 100 on these promissory
notes there is no defense? and so if an honost answer is filed»
then an immediate jvdgmeat would be taken» either that or a
d©fault j udgment.
Q

Well» I appreciate that» but, nevertheless,

until ha's had notice and opportunity to defend, no judgment
is entered upon which there can b© execution?
MR* PATTERSONs
Q

Oh.

Yes, Your Honor.

That's th© difference between the confession,

then, of course, and th© confession note end th© ordinary note?
MR. PATTERSONs
Q
Q

That is correct. Your Honor.

Yes.
Mr. Patterson, is it the duty of the Attorney

General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to defend the
constitutionality of the laws enacted by the legislature of
that state?
MR. PATTERSON %

It was always ray understanding that

there was, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through th©
Attorney General, appeared and did defend the constitutionality
v

©f this law in the proceedings below.
Q

But here they take a dive, so to speak.

MR, PATTERSON:

Then —

CLaughter.]
~~ there was a change of administration and —
Q

They join th® appellants and say that the court

43
— the only error in th© court’© decision was that it didn't
go far enough in holding this law unconstitutional.
MR. PATTERSONs

Two attorneys# Your Honor# who were

actually counsel of record for the plaintiffs, happened to go
up to the Attorney Gonera 19 s office and then, immediately after
that, pleadings started coming down with their names,
correspondence with their names, and since than they hava been
more discreet, they've used other naaa@s, and that is the
situation.
Q

So we don't have an adversary proceeding here

in this Court, do we?

There was no cross-appeal, there;5n

nobody her® asserting that the district court was wrong in
going so far as it did.
MR. PATTERSONs

Is that correct?
Well, we're asserting that the

district court's decision wee — first of all, we're defending
the district court's decision insofar as an attack is being
made on the proposition that a knowing, intelligent, and
understanding waiver is invalid —
Q

But that's as far as you can go, though --

MR. PATTERSON?
Q

— assuming th© fact that —

— having begin no cross-appeal, all you cm do

is defend th© district court's decision, which held pro taafc©
these laws constitutionally invalid?
MR. PATTERSONs Well, it is our contention that sine©
th© plaintiffs are trying to extend -the judgment of th© court

44
below to all consumer — to all loans by our clients to
consumers with income over §10,000, that.insofar as we as©
representing our clients as to that aspect of the ease, that
we can go into all questions of constitutionality.
...

a point that I would like to make —

MR. chief JUSTICE BURGERi

You're covering the

microphone, counsel.
MR. PATTERSONs

Oh, I'm sorry.

The next point I would like to make is the fact, that
tli© plaintiffs contend that the inadequate notice

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L» MATS, ESQ.,
ON BSHAI.F OF AMICUS CURIAE
MR. MAT2:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas© fcfes

Court;
I appear here on behalf of the Pennsylvania Savings
and Loan League, which is an organisation of savings and loans
in Pennsylvania, all ©£ which are mutual thrift; institutions.
They lend fchair money for fch© purpose of purchasing homes fey
their members.

And they appear in a different guise, as amicus

curia© below for the Insured Savings and Loan group of the
Philadelphia area? and in that position w® presented the
position of the mortgagee.

And we are appearing here again to

present the position of the mortgagee, the person who takes .a
bonded mortgage to secure a loan for th© purchase of real
estate,
Q

Well, you will, 1 assume, indicate why the

three-judge court excepted out the mortgage holders?
MR. MATS;
Q

Yes,

MR. MATE:
Q

I hope to, sir.

Yes.

They didn’t say anything why, did they?

MR. MATS;
Q

Did they?

MR. MATS;
Q

It's in th© opinion.

Is that enough?

MR. MATSs
Q

They did# sir.

Mo., 1 intend to go further# sir.

Yes.

MR. MATS:

I hops!

First# X should like to make clear that the matter
before this Court is an interpretation ©f the ru3.es of th©
Pennsylvania Supreme Court promulgated on the provisions in
th© Constitution,

And that is the issue here; not any statute.

The court below exempted bonds and mortgages in real
©state transactions, and X think for -the following reasons;
First and foremost# the plaintiff offered no evidence whatsoever
dealing with bends and mortgagee.

There wasn't on© bit of

evidence in the record by the plaintiff or by anyone which
indicated that# in any way# bonds and mortgages were in th©
same category as the defendants they had named in th® action#
which were a group'of finance companies.
Mow# if Your Honors will read the complaint# you
will find that the entire direction of the complaint is to
th© conduct of certain finance companies.
Q

What's the difference as a matter of leg®!

doctrine# laying aside the question of Chavis?
MR. MATSs

Mo.

Th© court below made that distinction#

that, there was no evidence,, and the court said that in
determining the class t© be covered by this action, only those
persons against whom there was evidence should fo-a included
in the class, unless there was soma good reason for including
them, which was not given.

And the court said that the

plaintiff had given no evidence with reference'to this, and
indicated no reason why the mortgage bond class should be
included in the class.
Nov?, in my —

Then you war© not named -»

MR. mates
Q

Sorry?

You were not nam@d defendants nor any of your

class named defendants, were they?
MR. MATE:
Q

And you war® in es amicus?

MR. MATSs
Q

No, sir.

That's correct, sir.

And amicus her©?

MR. MATS:

That's correct, sir.

That'& correct.
X should lik© to point out that what the ~~ [hits
microphone] — I'm sorry
bond transaction and

a

**- the differences between a mortgage

financing transaction for a small loan

company.
For one, the mortgage bond transaction arises out of
the purchase of a home

Secondly, it has been established below that in
almost every ease where a farm was purchased, the purchaser was
represented by either an attorney ©r by a licensed realtor.
So 'the purchaser did have representation at the time of closing*
Thirdly, ©t the time of closing, th® purchaser '•
received a statement under Regulation 2 undor the Truth in
Landing Act, which clearly indicates to the purchaser afc that
time that he has executed a document which has within it a
confession of judgment*
Fourthly, the lending institutions that w© represent
have nothing to do with the sal© of real estate or any other
product, they have only one purpose, to lend money for fch©
purchase of homes, and that's all; they are not involved in
questions of breach of warranty or anything like that*

They

only lend money to members of the association for the purposes
of buying a home.
Now, with reference to fch® actual foreclosure
procedures, which I think was talked about before, when a

-

foreclosure is begun on real estate, the bond, is entered of
record, that is not really a new lien because that bond is
part of the same transaction for which a mortgage was executed,
which is already a lien on the property and has been a lien
on the property from the moment the loan was made.

So that the

entry of a bond creates no new obligation by the borrower,
it is merely a different procedure for executing against the

real ©state.

There are no two obligations, there is only one.

And it's the sam© obligation, whether it is the bond or the.
mortgage, payment of one discharges the other.
When the sheriff —
Q

I’d think that you could foreclose without it.

You don’t need thin provision to foreclose, do you?
MR. MATZs
Q

Yes.

MR. MAT2z
Q

Th© bond provision?

W@ could ~

No, I mean the provision on — yes, that's it.

MR. MATS3

We could foreclose on th© mortgage, but

that would be a ram proceeding? it would have several defects
in it.

Per one thing, it is more expensive? for another thing,

it takes much longer to do.

Thirdly, in today's market, with

real estate dropping, a hiatus of several months in foreclosure
can be very serious to th© position of the lender.
And, as I pointed out, this is purely n procedural
question, whether we proceed qn the bond or we proceed on the
mortgage»

W© think it is better for the lender to proceed on

the bond? we think it is better .for the borrower, too, because
if w@ have a market where w© can.realise on our security
mere quickly, w© can lend © larger margin and at a smaller
interest rat®.
New, we pointed out below that th© Philadelphia area
has th® lowest mortgage interest rat© in the United States.

50
ted I am not saying her® that this is the only reason„ but I
am certainly saying tills is one of the reasons.
Q

But oa the bond foreclosure, you do it outside

court?
me.

MATS;

All foreclosures are done outside court.

Your Honor, whether it’s on the bond or on the mortgage.
Q

On tha mortgage?

MR, MATS:

That's correct.

ted do not have to appear in court unless an answer
is filed.
Q

Is that right?

MB. MATS:

That8® correct.

Mow, I wanted to point out that on a petition to
open judgment, our experience has been that the court invariably
grants that petition, when it is filed, for even tha most
flimsy of reasons, and that petition carries with it a stay
of proceedings•

So that if a defendant who has at least 20

days —
Q

That’s not on right, I take it?

MS. MATS;
Q

Is that on proceedings of right?

MR. MATS:
it, sir.

I have never —

I have never seen ones that didn’t carry

I don’t .think that th© right

that tha rules say

specifically, but X have never in my practice sasn a petition
to ©pen judgment allowed without a stay of' proceedings.

ted

I have never seen on© refused
Th& court —
Q

The stay is granted pending determination of

whether the judgment will be reopened?
MR. MATZs
Q

That's correct. sir.

But the reopening is not a formality?

MR. MAT?.:

The opening is not automatic*, sir.

Me»

But the burden of proof on that is exactly the- e.s's©
■ms if it would have been in. a complaint in assumpsit.

There

"was no difference»
Q

I understand.

MR. MATS:

Exactly the same.

The defendant, on an execution on real estate, gets
at least 20 days' notice of the sal©, and usually considerably
more.

The minimum time he receives is 20 days., which is

exactly the same time that a defendant in a suit on a complaint
;

has to file an answer.

He has exactly the same tim®, 2(3 days,

in which to do something.

If he doesn't co it in the 20 or more

days he has available, then there may bo a sale.
During the period from the date of execution to the
date of sale, there is no interference with & debtor's right
of possession or the use ©£ the property.

He remains in

possession, uses it. as he did before, with no interference in
any way of his rights.
Q

And do you know whether that's the same with

personalty?
MR. MATZs That may or may not b©, sir.

on

It depends

th© circumstances.
Q

All right.

MR. MATE:
is th© same.

That th© sheriff merely makes a levy, it

If th© sheriff is directed to take th© personalty

into custody# it may b© different.

This would depend on th©

particular levy in that particular case.
2n real estatef it is certainly so.
Now,, I pointed out. before that the matter before
this Court was the construction of the rules of our Supreme
Court# and I should like to point out that at no time has our
Supreme Court been asked to rule on th® validity of thee®
same rules which it has promoted, and it might be adviatis
to refer tills back and ask for our courts to rule on these
matters# which have presently never been ruled upon.
I think I have tried to point out why th© mortgage
situation differs in large measure from th© finane© company
situation# and from the other situations, are these matters
which I think induced th© court below to make an exception
of the situations where a savings and loan or other lending
institution lends money for th® purchase of a home or for
improvements to a home.

And w© think this: i® an entirely

different type of case from that on® where* lending is mads for
other purposes.

And this wasn’t.
