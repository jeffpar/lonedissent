Mr. Lesser, you raay proceed whenever you're ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M* LESSER, ESQ,,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LESSERj

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas© the Courts
This is an appeal under Title 23, Section 1253, from
the judgment of a three-judge District Court in the District of
Connecticut, which denied injunctive and declaratory relief.
The issue is whether the Federal Courts are powerless
to award any redress to low-income wage-earners whose earnings
on deposit are summarily garnished by Connecticut deputy
sheriffs 'without any notice, hearing, or order of the State
Court.
Q
me?

How, in Connecticut, will you clear this up for

Must there be an action pending against the defendant at

the time?
MR. LESSER*

I would like, Mr. Chief Justice, to

begin answering that question, and then explain —
Q

All right.

MR. LESSER*

— tli® Connecticut practice of summary

prajudgment in seme detail, because it is quit© unusual.
Q

'fas.

You do it your own way, then.

4
MR. LESSER:

Sn Connecticut, an alleged creditor and

his attorney have absolute discretion, prior to instituting
suit against the debtor, to summarily garnish earnings in his
account, without any involvement of the court.

The garnishment

occurs before process is served upon the debtor.
The attorney for the alleged creditor instructs
deputy sheriffs to levy the garnishment by serving a writ of
garnishment oh the garnisheed bank.
Q

Then when do you get the judgment?
s-

MR. LESSER:

Judgment is obtained perhaps several

years after civil action is commenced, by service of process
on the debtor, Mr. Justice Brennan.
Q

Well, what's

but you garnish, as here, X

gather, a savings account?
MR. LESSERs
Q

And a checking account, Mr. Justice —-

And a checking account.

Mow, then, the

garnishor has immediately to file a civil action in that?
MR. LESSER:
Q

He does not immediately need to file.

How much tiro© does he have?

MR. LESSERt

Under the applicable statute, Section

329 of Title 32, and Section 48a of Title 52, it would be
possible for th© garnishment to be levied, for example, on
day one, for the alleged debtor to be served with process,
let us say, on day 45 or 50? and for process to be docketed in
the State Court, let us say, on day 55.

5

Q

And you don't gat into the State Coart until

day S5?
ME. LESSEE:

On© never gets into the State Court on

a garnishment, Mr. Justice Brennan, to raise any questions with
respect to that garnishment.

How, —
Q

You mean after the proceeding —» even after you

get into the State Court on clay 55?
MR. LESSER: That is correct, Mr. justice, and 1
would like to explain that.
Connecticut appears to be the only State in which an
alleged creditor and his attorney are permitted, in their
absolute discretion, to levy and maintain a garnishment until
final disposition of the creditor suit, without any involvement
of the State Court.
Most ether States require the creditor to got some
sort of court approval before garnishment, either in the form
of posting ©f bends, filing an affidavit, and, so far as we
know, in all other States the writ of garnishment must foe
signed or issued by a judge or clerk of court? none of that
obtains here.
How, once the creditor's civil suit for damages is
docketed, no questions relating to the garnishment can be
comsid©r©d in the context of the creditor's pending suit,

If

the debtor claims that the garnishment was levied without any

s
probable validity, that the creditor’s claim has no merit,
or that there was no necessity for a garnishment, as in-Mrs.
Lynch’s

Mrs. Toro’s cases, for exemplo, where we allege that

they were Connecticut wage-earners, raising a family in
Connecticut, steadily employed, no grounds as in Minnesota,
for example, where garnishment is permitted only whore there
may be some danger that a debtor may escape from the juris­
diction to evade service of process or fraudulently conceals
his asset®.
Q

Well, there must be an action pending first

©gainst the defendant,

shouldn’t there?

MR, LESSERz There need not be an action pending first,
Mr, Chief Justice.
Q

You ware addressing yourself to Minnesota,

MR, LESSERj
Q

Oh, yes, that is correct.

Which is fairly common of many other States, is

it not?
MR. LESSER: That is correct, Mr, Chief Justice.
In most other States, the garnishment is not permitted to foe
levied unless the court has issued the writ, and there is a
civil action pending.

Q

Of course, in most other States, at least those

with which I am familiar, the very word "garnishment” means
going after somebody's wages, going after his employer for
his wages.

Her© what we're talking about is what's generally

7
known in other States as an attachment, isn’t it?
MR. LESSERs

Q

In Connecticut the term "garnishment" —~

Doesn’t this — well, excuse me? go ahead»

MR,. LESSER:

In Connecticut the term "garnishment11

is used, Ms:. Justice Stewart, as a term permitting a creditor
to reach debts owing to a debtor, which are in the hands of a
third person.
Q

But not — but explicitly not wages, as I

understand it?
MR. LOSSES?

We have alleged in these cases that the

constitutional deprivation that Mrs. Lynch and Mrs. Toro have
suffered is indistinguishable from that suffered by'Christine
Sniadacth.

The only difference -■»

Q

I understand here, I understand your legal
1 am asking a question that -»

argument.

MR. LESSER:

Wages in the hands of an employer, Mr.

Justice, are exempt from garnishment until after judgment, and
then it*s called an execution.

Q

Right.

MR. LESSER s But wages deposited in accounts ~~
8

In a bank account?

MR. LESSER:
I think the

vas.

In a bank account.

And in the Lynch case

parallel with Christine Sniadach is most clearly

appreciated? her employer dedusted ten dollars of her $69
pay check each week.

Q

ted deposited it in a bank account — in a

savings account»
MR.

LESSER:

And automatically deposited it in a

credit union savings account at her place of employment.
Q

Right.

MR. LESSERe

Now, once the creditor — as 1' was

saying -»*
Q

Do you have any amount exempt from garnishment

in Connecticut?
MR. LESSERs

Mr. Justice BXachmunt there is a statute

Section 352, I believe, of Title 52, which sets out what the
exemptions are.

That is a very old statute, and the relevant

portions for exemptions are necessary tools for the debtor's
trad©? and necessary household goods,
Q

But no cash amount, no monetary amount?

MR. LESSER2

Only after judgment, when wages in the

hands of the employer are executed upon, is there any exemption
I believe At’s either the first $65 of the wage-earner's
net income that is exempt, or 25 percent of his disposable
income', whichever is greater.
But as to garnishments on wages deposited in accounts
there is no exemption,
Now, if the creditor — excuse me? if the debtor
attempts to raise any issues with respect to the garnishment,
in the creditor's suit there is no authority of the court to

9

entertain those issues, and there is no appeal from the denial
of relief, because Connecticut does not permit interlocutory
appeals, and such appeals are deemed to be interlocutory.
There are only two questions in Connecticut which a
debtor can raise with any hops of getting either a dissolution
or a reduction of tha garnishment.
We have discussed those on pages 14 through 16 of our
brief.
A debtor, in order to raise' these issues, must
instituto separate proceedings pursuant to specific statutos
by serving process upon the creditor or his attorney.
How, he can complain that the garnishment unreason­
ably exceeds the amount that the creditor himself claims as
damages, but the court, the State Court has no ability, no
power to inquire into the probable validity of the creditor“b
claim.
The only inquiry is directed to what the amount of
the creditor’s claim is.

In Mrs. Lynch's cane, in the suit on a note, it's
very clear what the creditor*® claim is.

The garnishment dees

not exosod the amount which the creditor claims is damages;
therefore, Mrs. Lynch cannot make use of that statute.
Neither could Mrs. Toro, for the same reason, before her
garnishment was released.
The debtor may also move to substitute a bond, but —*

meat has beers released?
MR. LESSER:

Mrs. Toro's particular garnishment ht%

bean released,. Mr. Justice, and the District Court stated that
this raised some question of moetness, which it did not decide.
But, as our prayers for relief demonstrate, pages 10
of the Appendix and 3? and 38, we were also looking for.
injunction against garnishments to be levied by deputy sheriffs
in the future on behalf of other creditors of Mrs. Lynch and
Mrs,. Toro,
Now, aside from posting a bond, which the, wage-earners
in this appeal are too poor to afford, and aside from the
reduction of the garnishment, where it unreasonably exceeds the
amount that the creditor claims, the State Court has no power l:o
release a garnishment.
That is why w@ are saying that the District Court was
in error in these casea.

I think that the procedure in

Connecticut highlights that the garnishments in these eases
axe not proceedings in a State Court,

No court involvement

is necessary from the date of levy until final disposition.
Any questions relating to the garnishment must be raised in a
context separate from the creditor’s suit.

Q

The Connecticut —

Would your case be any different if your -client

were General Motors?
MR. LESSERs

I think that this case would be different

11
with respect to the jurisdictional point,. Mr» Justice Blaenau»,
if our client were General Motors? not with respect to tbs
2283 point.
If I may just —
0

Because it*® rather effective to garnish large

corporation's bank accounts once in a while.
MR.LESSERt

In Connecticut there is a statute,

Section 337a of Title 52, which requires a court order for
garnishment of chocking accounts to the extent that they
exceed $5,000.
The grounds upon which an order can issue are set out

in that statute, and parallel, curiously very closely, the
procedure in a number of other States.

The alleged creditor

must make some showing that the debtor is about to abscond,
avoid service of process, or conceal his property.
?

But those

w

protections are not available to low-income wage-earners.
The three-judge court in this case dismissed the
complaints on motion to dismiss on two grounds:

first, relying

on the Second Circuit decision in Eigen v, Eastman, the threejudge court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction
under Section 1343/'Subsection (3), of Title 28, on the ground
that at most the wage-earner could allege an unconstitutional
deprivation, a substantial question of an unconstitutional
deprivation of their property, valued at. loss than $10,000«
Its second ground, despite its recognition that

17
suKtmary garnishments are levied without any court involvement,
was that Title 28, Section 2283, the anti - in j tin c ti on statuta,
barred all relief.
Now, the rule that we are contending for with respect
to the jurisdiction point, and we think that this rule follows
directly from this Court’s decision in Monroe^ vs. Pen-- tan
years ago, is that whenever a natural person alleges a not
insubstantial deprivation of his Fourteenth to.endraant rights
under color of State law, Sections 1982 and 1343 are satisfied.
o'

Now, I say natural person, Mr, Justice Blackmun, I
don’t think that this case needs to go so far as to hold that
General Motors, or a corporation, has the right of action.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

We'll suspend for lunch

at this time, counsel.
(Whereupon, at 3,2*00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1*00 p.m., the same day.)

13
AFTERNOON SESSION
{1 sOO p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Mr. Lesser, you have

about X? minutes of your time left now.
MR. LESSER* Thank 70x1 ? Mr, Chief Justice.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court*
1 would like to resume my discussion of the denial
of subject matter jurisdiction by the three-judge District Court,
which was the first ground upon which it denied the injunctive
relief that our complaint requested.
The rule which we are proposing that this Court hold
in this case is that Sections 1983 ami 1343 he satisfied by
allegation of the Fourteenth Amendment deprivations, by parsons
acting under color of State law.
We believe that this rule is fully supported.

The

only reasonable conclusion is by examination of the legislative
history and the decisions as discussed in our brief and our
reply brief.
We think that a clear enunciation of this rule would
have the very great advantage of ending the great confusion
which now exists in the different circuits as to the scope of
Section 1343, and that it would also end or curtail the needless
litigation which has resulted from that confusion.
We discuss the differing circuits® interpretations
and hem inconsistent they are with one another, on pages 22

14

through 27

of

our

brief,

and in our reply brief at pegs 15

no, 13»
As to the second ground upon which the District. Court
denied injunctive relief and declaratory relief, the ground
■that Title 28, Section 2283, barred all relief, wo would say that
this Court used not adopt a broad rule, because the garnishments
in these cases ares not proceedings pending in the Connecticut
courts.
The Connecticut Supreme Court said, more than 50 years
ago, in the case of Sachs v, Nussenbaum, which we have cited
in our brief and reply brief, that the release of a garnish­
ment has no effect upon the pending creditor’s civil suit*
No State Court interest in adjudication would be affected by
holding that the garnishments in these case© arc not proceedings
in the State Court, because they ar® not under the control of
the State Court,
We do not believe -that in this case this Court need
reach the question of whether Section 1983 is an expressly
authorised exception t© Section 2283, even though we feel that
in these cases we 1have shown through our brief that the
wage-earners have no redress in the State Courts.
And I would refer the Court to the case of Michael’s
Jawelers

Vo

Handy, cited in our brief, in which, after the
i

Sniadach decision,' a IcwOincome debtor challenged the very
statute, Title 52, Section 329, under which the garnishments

in these cases were levied # on the ground that they deprived
her of notice and hearing# procedural due process.
Q

Let me 3©e if I can get a little bettor light

on your constitutional argument .by a hypothetical # with
reference to the other States.

If a garnishment wore permitted

by notice# by process served on the garnishee and on the
defendant# after an action had been coMaenead in the State
Court# do you think that mat® constitutional standards?
MR» LESSERs

Mr. Chief Justice# if garnishments wore

levied after notice and hearing were given to the debtor#
we would say that that would be constitutional safeguards?
but that issue is not before this Court.
Q

The reason

Is® trying to test some of your other arguments

by that, process hero.
MR. LESSERs
Q

Yes# sir.

8# notice# you mean a notice ~~ that the . notice-

must allow a period to respond before? th& garnishment would
take effect?
MR. LESSER;

Yes# Mr, Chief Justic®.

'

Q

■)

And then# of course# there wouldn't usually he

any property remaining.
MR. LESSER;
Q

Exactly the same -~

Unless the property were impounded pending the

disposition of the process.
MR. LESSER? We would be asking for exactly the same

protections accorded to Christine Saiadach.

Several State

Comets have held prejudgment attachment and garnishment
unconstitutionala
The resolution of the constitutional issue is not.
before this Court, however,

I’ve raised — I’ve

explained the

practice of prejudgment garni aliment in order to give context
to our claims that garnishment is not a proceeding in a State
Court, and the severe deprivations that result from oxeluding
Mrs, Lynch and Mrs. Toro from a federal forum.

If this case

i

i® remanded, then the District Court will reach the
constitutional issues, and wo will fee able to litigate them
there? but the three-judge court itself recognised, although
it did not roach the constitutional issue,, and decided, Mr.
Chief Justice, that the wage-earners had raised substantial
constitutional issues in light of this Court’s decision in
the Sniadacfa case.
But that, whether the constitutional principle
ultimately at issue her© would involve an extension of Saiadach,
is not before the Court hero.
Q

Well, in your challenge here, you say they were

in error in denying that it had jurisdiction over this action?
MR. LESSERs
0

Yes.

And if we agree with you on that, we don’t

reach the merits?

Q

That's right

MR. LESSERs That’s right# Mr. Justice Brennan
Also that the three-judge court was in error in holding that
Section 2283 barred relief.
And although the opinion of the three-judge court is
not antirely clear, it seems to us that a reading of it will
indicate that the three-judge court did not hold summary
*

garnishments to be proceedings in a State Court. The vay we
read the opinion# Mr. Justice# is that the three-judge court
felt it enjoined — that releasing garnishments would probably
interfere with, the existing creditor’s suit.

This is on

motion to dismiss# and, additionally# the Connecticut Supreme
Court itself has held# in the Sachs case# that release does
not affect the creditor.
So that it’s an entirely different matter.
Finally# as to our 2203 point# we do not believe#
under any circumstances # that Section 2233 would bar an
injunction against Connecticut deputy sheriffs from filing
future summery garnishments in proceedings cf existing
creditor suits# not yet instituted# by other creditors of
Mrs. Lynch and Mrs. Toro.
In conclusion# the only question before this Court­
is whether Congress intended Mrs. Lynch’s and Mrs. Toro’s
complaints to be heard in a Federal forum.
We submit that since they have alleged substantial
Fourteenth Amendment violations# and that they have no redress

ie
in the courts of Connecticut, their claims must be board
in the- Federal Court.
We therefore ask tills Court to reverse the judgment
of tile three-judge court below, and to remand it for resolution
of the merits.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Lesser.

Mr. Ball.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. SELL, ESQ,,
OK BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR, BELL:

Mr. Chief Justices and may it pleas® the

Court;
I would like to pick tap, if I may, precisely the
point where my brother, Mr. Lesser, left off? and that is
posing the question as to whether Congress intended those
claims to have been heard by the three-judge District Court
below.
The basic holding of the lower court was that it did
not have subject matter jurisdiction under Section 1343, and
that was the basis of its dismissal.
Wow, the appellees11 position on the 1342 jurisdictional
question rests squarely upon the doctrine enunciated in the
Bisen case, which in turn goes back to the postulation by
Mr. Justice Stone in the Hague decision as to the relation
between 1343 and 3.331

19
And I’d like to review that#, be canoe that's the

basis

of our position and the

basis of the lower ovnrt'n dis­

missal below.
Now, the appellants have a direct argument and ar.
appealing argument as to why this is not so, and thay say,
basically, that the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted with t’vs
purpose in mind to protect precisely the kind of right •that
As involved in this case.
Further, that Section 1343 and Section 1983, the
statute creating cause of action, were designed to pick up
that — these constitutional rights and to provide a cause of
action and jurisdiction to secure them.
Finally, the appellants say that Section 1331, the
$19,000 jurisdictional statute, is to be looked upon as
separate find apart from and distinct from the 1343 and 1983
propositions.
Now, if the matter were as clear as this from
legislative history, the wonder is, really, that Mr. Justice
Eton© had to go through his process of reasoning in the Hague
decision at all.

And the answer must fee, simply, that a

selective choice of the legislative history is simply not as
clear and not as precise and not as symmetrical as the
appellants would have it.

I believe that the reason for this, really, is that
what you overlook in establishing that kind of precise intent

to a portion of the civil rights legislation is the mature
of the 'process that went on in Congress for the period followin
the Civil War,

In Mr, Justice Frankfurter's words, these

were years of struggle and of compromise.

And to reduce a

portion of th© legislative result to clarity and directness
and simplicity overlooks the nature of that struggle, and it
overlooks ’the triumphs and the defeats of that compromising
process, and it overlooks the intensity of the passions that
were involved as the post-Civil War Congresses tried to hammer
out, in lasting terras, what it was that had torn the country
apart for five years during th© Civil War,
New, I think it’s instructive to review the period
that's in question, while this legislative history accumulates,
We begin in 1865 with the Thirteenth Amendment itself
which is, of course. Emancipation.
In 1866, we have the first of the Civil Rights Acts,
That was -«die Act which, among other things, included what 1©
today Section 1983* that statute dealing with equal rights as
to ownership and as to disposition of property, and there is
evidence from the history, as suggested in our brief, that
t*

19S3 was the keystone of the reconstruction Congress' effort
to preserve that kind of property right.
In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment itself.
In 18‘?0, there's another Civil Rights Act, and the
Fifteenth Amendment, dealing with voting rights, canes into

21
being,
In ' 2,871, there are two Civil Slights Acts that come
on the books, and one of them is the so-called Ku Kim: Xlem
Act of 1371, from whence the present-day 1963 statute, Grooving
the cause of action, and the 1343 jurisdictional statute
derive.
Now, there is evidence in the history that what wr-?•
of paramount concern in tJis Ku Klux Klan Act of IS71 was the
unequal treatment of people, evidenced by the Klan activity in
the South, from whence the Act took its name? the discrimination
on the basis of race? its denial of equal opportunities? and
the denial of the equal application of the laws in the years
following the Civil War.
Finally, the last stage in'this legislative history,
•• £

l

in .1875, is the first emergence of Section 1331, the
jurisdictional statute, which now deals in terms of $10,000,*
but,-at the time of its original passage, I believe .it was-'a
$500 statute.
'

There’s a pause in 1075, and there’s a recodification
that takes placo in that year, and some adjustments are made
to the statutes that had preceded it*
For instance, l believe it’s at that time that the
statement in 1933, dealing with a cause, of action based on
federal laws, as well as the Constitution, first comes into
being, in 1875.

\

•>?

The jurisdictional statute , 3.343, include;'? at that
time a statement with respect to causes of action based on
federal laws denying equal rights, and express reference to tit.
kind of equality concern that was at the heart of the Civil
Rights legislation.

Mow, what Mr. Justice Stone1s formulation in the
Hague case does is take the year 3.875 as the point of. departure .•
from whence both 1343 and 1331 have existed on the. boobs sicli

by side, down to the time of the Hague decision, which is 1939.
Excuse me, there was one legislative activity during
that period, but not of tremendous significance? that was the
1911 recodification, when the jurisdiction of the Circuit
Courts and the District Courts became merged in the District
Courts, and 1343, the jurisdictional statute, preserved the
phrase that it has today dealing with jurisdiction of causes
under those federal laws providing for equal rights.
How, what Mr. Justice stone saw from the history that
ha locked at in its entirety, and as a whole, were those two
parallel statutes, on© providing a cause of action under
Section .1343, with no monetary allocation, no monetary require»

remit whatsoever, and the parallel statute, 1331, which did in
fast have a monetary requirement, which, as 1 said before,
has been changed during the course of the years.
Mow, his analysis lad him to believe that 1343, that
jurisdictional statute which is at issue in this case, was the

23
one intended to foe directed at those causes of action which
were essentially denials of personal rightf and those causes of
action based essentially on denial of the equal protection of
the law; -the discriminatory evils which the Reconstruction
Congress had noted in the Ku Kims Klan Act and others.
1331» on the other hand, according to Mr. Justice
Stone’s formulation, was that statute designed to pick up those
action© where ware essentially of a property nature capable

a

of being measured in monetary amounts•
How, in looking S?aak at this history, his field of
vision was not entirely uncluttered, or unclear, because he
had precedents before him, in such cases as the Pleasants case,
Greonhcw, and Holt v. Indiana, which were cases giving some
attention to the 1343 question.
tli®

And those eases had started

attack consistent with Mr. Justice Stone’s

formulation, to the effect that 1343 was the statute dealing
•fv:br' •
-

!

with civil right© ? 1331 the statute dealing with, property
allegations, which were purely property, and did not involve
those rights susceptible of being measured in- monetary or
pecuniary teras.
Now, that’s the rational©

that
/ Mr. Justice atone, in

Hague relies, and that’s the one that comes to rest in the
Second Circuit case involving Elsen, which was Judge
Friendly*s opinion some 30 years later» X believe in 1969.
How, in the Bisen decision» Judge Friendly is candid

and frank to note the difficulties with the Hague formulation ,
because it was 30 years previous , and also because there was
no majority opinion in the case, and Judge Friendly pointed that
out in the course of his opinion.
However, notwithstanding what he termed to be
difficulties with it, and notwithstanding soma self-confessed
uncertainty as he explains quite explicitly in his opinion,
he filed that the formulation had three specific virtues•
He saw It, as the counting point, the prior decisions
of this Court that, as' far as the time of the Bisan case, both
tnw • w »,«iu

as to where jurisdiction had been granted and then a as to .«hero
it had not, with one exceptions

He saw it, as harmonising,

the parallel relation of 1343 and 1331 during the long history
stemming from the recodifioation in 1875,

1
i

And finally, h© felt convinced, in the Bis'en opinion,
that this rationale of Mr. Justice Stone preserved in 1343
the kind of case that was at fha heart of the Civil Rights
\

enactment immediately following the Civil War? that is, it
preserved those causes of action based on discrimination,
based on unequal treatment, based on denial of equal opportunity,
which could not be measured in money, and which would not
lend themselves to any kind of property analysis0
And thus, 'the Kie.-an decision in the Second Circuit
effectively repeats the Stone analysis and gives rise to the
separation between 1343 and 1331, on tho basis of whether or not

the right alleged or asserted is pr is not capable

of monetary

valuation, or whether it's one of those intangible rights of
personal liberty which is not so capable, and therefore for
which no monetary requirement lies within the statute.
Now, it was' the application of this analysis, that is
'..u

of the Bison rationale based on Mr» Justice Stone's rationale,
that, was at the heart of the lower court's dismissal, .on the
basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction in this case.
*

Now, the garnishment process in Connecticut — and
may X just explain that the garnishment process is a kind of
attachment, and Mr, Justice Stewart raised this question, I
believe the statute itself is Title 104 on attachment, and
garnishment is used with respect to that statute with the
it's
understanding that/part of the over-all attachment pattern in
the State of Connecticut»
Q

But in Connecticut, as 1 understand it, one

thing that cannot bo reached prior to judgment is wages owing /

/

from an employer to an employe©.
MB, BELL;

That's correct, Your Honor, ’ If we look at

the attachment statutes as a whole, there are. several tilings
which, as a matter of fact, are proscribed, all of them having
kind of a common thr&ad of interest, which r@flse.te a legis­
lative concern in Connecticut for those kinds of property which
corns closest to enabling one to exist and to enable one to
operate in a free society.

personal effects.

Yen cannot deal with household or

You cannot reach the tools of ore’s trad©.

You cannot roach an automobile without a court order.

There

are certain kinds of action wherein attachment of any natura ,
garnishment or otherwise» is prohibited before a suit.
There are classes of plaintiffs as to whom the process
is denied in advance of suit.
j

Q

Xs there any time limit, counsel, that the

garnishment may remain in effect for trial on the merits?

Scsae

States put a time limit; sis months, three months ~~
MR. BELL*

No.

If the garnishment is properly

effected at the outset of the suit, it will remain pending
throughout the duration of the suit, so its time limit is co­
extensive with the pendency of the lawsuit itself.
Q

Bo if n lawsuit — if, in a particular district,
<

there wars three years in reaching cases for trial, the money
would foe impounded all that time?
MR. BELLs That’s correct.

The garnishment would

i

continue to apply during the pendency of that action, and
until the — within a certain period following judgment, as a
matter'of fact, allowing for execution on that garnishment.
That is correct.

j

The point I’m trying to make there is that the process
from the beginning is circumscribed with respect to certain

i
i

classes of assets and certain classes of suits and certain
classes of plaintiffs for whom or as to whom the process is
simply not available.
Now, these two plaintiffs in the basic cases below
had money claims against the defendants, one suit on a note,
the other back rent.

They were prohibited by Connecticut

statutes from attaching the kinds of assets or seeking to
garnish the kinds of assets that I’ve described; that is,
wages at the source, automobiles without a court order,
necessary household or personal effects, or tools of one's
trad®.
They were permitted to garnish, to reach the assets
not in the hands of the debtor but in the hands of a third party.
In this case, in one hand a savings account, in the other a
checking account.

Essentially a debt due, which is the key

word in our garnishment statute, from those banking institutions
to the defendants in question.
Now, the effect of doing so is to put, place a
conditional lien on that asset during the pendency of that
lawsuit.

Once that is done, that is once the garnishment process

is effected, there are provisions under the statute whereby the
defendant can come in directly to the court for reduction or
bill of particulars for verification of the claim or a
substitution of bond.

And that does not rely on the pendency

of the cult, that can bo done as soon s.e the garnishment process

28
has been reached.
But it was under these circumstances, that is, in
looking at a debt due the defendants from a third party, that
the court below attempted to analyze the nature of the .interest
involved and found it. to be essentially & property interest.
That is, one measurable by money, since the accounts in question
were in fixed amounts.
Being a property interest, it found it not to lie
within the 1343 formulation, under the Eicon and Hague
rationales, and being merely a property interest, the decision
of the lower court based ~~ finding itself without jurisdiction,
was based on the implicit assumption that it would be subject
to the 1331 jurisdictional statute.
How, there was an alternative holding in the court
below, and that was the one predicated on 2283.

2283 being

the anti-injunction statute, which proscribes the application
of injunction during the pendency of the wtate Court proceedings.
And this “was relied upon by the lower court as an
alternative holding, having addressed itself to the jurisdic­
tional issue first.
How, the purpose and the policy of 2203, X believe,
are familiar.

The statute dates from 1793, and it reflects the

kind of sensitive concern for State proceedings that ought to
be had by the federal judicial system, once, the State proceeding
or once the State system has been set in motion.

St was a

matter of first business for the Congress of the Uni tad States'
to establish that relation between the two judicial processes•
Now, the Carnegie garnishment statute, or the
attachment statute with which we are dealing with dates of almcm
equal vintage, as a matter of fact; it goes bach to the beginning
of the State of Connecticut and represents a scheme that has
been in effect in the State of Connecticut during its judicial
history.

Wo thus have this old State policy, and a venerable

federal policy now in focus within th© confines of Section
2283, the anti-injunction statute.
Mow, tha question becomes whether, for the purpose.'* of
Section 2283, th® garnishment arrangement in Connecticut, th®
garnishment machinery constittat.ee proceedings within the
meaning of Section 2283 as to which the federal action should
b© stayed during the pendency of the State case and the State
procedure.

on the word "court" or legal.
MR, BELL?

Your Honor, 1 believe takes in all phases of a lawsuit, and it
takes them in from beginning to end.

There is a Hill v, Martin

for the relation of these judicial systems, given the fast
that the question, as a matter of fact , an to -constitutionality
is an open question in the Connecticut court, and'given th©
language of prior Court decisions hare, in Hill v. Martin,
1 would suggest it is proceedings.
*

The Hill language of
dKarat<usacM«c>

Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggested that the concept of proceeding

33
for 2283 purposes should include all steps and all phases of a
lawsuit or actions by ministerial officers of the courtP
including those which are directed , either ancillary or
supplementary, towards making the suit or the judgment
effective.
And I would say that that, concept of proceedings,
dealing with the whole workings of the judicial processes of
a State, doss include the process of garnishment, and does
Include the process of attachment.
Q

Is the sheriff in Connecticut elected or

appointed by the court?
MR. BSLLs
this, was appointed,

I believe the deputy sheriff, who served
H© is appointed, I believe, by a sheriff

who is an elected official, if I'm not mistaken.

1’ believe

that, is right,

Q

Well, is h© responsible to the court?

MR. BEL&s

Well, he*3 an officer, a ministerial

officer who must at. least have enough color of State law to
fit in undor 'dia original statute appointing him.

Q

1 apologize for being even more technical.

(Laughing•5
MR. BELLs

Well, I would suggest that he is a

ministerial officer in serving the writs or the papers
involved in the garnishment process.

■

The lawyer is the one

who initiates the action, who, in Connecticut, is termed the

34

eo3sai.E8i.oner of the superior court, an officer of the court.
He must work through a statutorily 'designated officer to serve
process * who, in so doing, is the ministerial officer of the
court, I would submit, for the purposes of Section 2?.83 and
its concept of proceedings.
Wow, X think the express language of that Hill case
is significant because it emphasises it is not just the
question of liability or not in the lawsuit itself, it
embraces those activities triggered by the lawsuit which
bear upon making a judgment secure or effective ancillary
proceedings instituted by ministerial officers. And I believe
that concept of proceeding, when we have a pending State
action, is the one that should apply under Section 2283.
Now, one of the things that was raised by
Q

May I ask, Mr. Bell:

of the court below, page 26.

I'm looking at the opinion

What they have said is:

"although garnishment may be separated, the underlying in
personam action," just, what do you say to that?
MR. BELL:

X believe what it was saying, Your Honor,

is that the question, for instance, of liability or not, the
basic rationale of any judgment that might be rendered by the
court is separate from the garnishment proceeding.

X believe

that's -die context, Mr, Justice Brennan, in which the threejudge court was using it there.
Q

I don't find anywhere in this opinion, I gather

that under the statute the question is whether this garnishment
whatever it is, is a proceeding in a State Court? is that it?
That's the question*
ME. BELL:
Q

That’s correct»

I don't see that this opinion addresses itself

directly to that question, doss it?
MR. BELL:

I think the language is not as direct as

I would have liked to have seen it, but the holding under 2233
must necessarily involve tbs conclusion that it constitutes
proceedings? thee© is reference mad© by the —
Q

Well, it*3 store than proceedings.

Does it

constitute proceedings in a State Court?

creditor's complaints filed here, in relation to the time of

MR, BELL?

to the Federal Court?
Q

Yes.

MR. BELL;

Well,, the creditors' complaints ware filed

in Lynch on July 1 of 1970, Toro in February, and the ccaplnints
in the Federal Court were, I believe, in March or April 1971.
Q

In any event, after the creditors' complaints

were filed in the State Court?
MR,, BELL:

Yes, sir.

Those actions were —
Q

But I gather that

in this case in the Federal

Court, the complaint did not ask for any restraint against the
prosecution of the creditors' complaints in the State Court?
MR. BELL:

Well# it asked for — not prosecution, it

asked for injunction against the utilisation of these Connection
garnishment statutes as to these points.
Q

Mo, but my question was, it did not ask any

restraint against the creditors going on with their creditor
suits, did it?
MR, BELLs

I have to answer you're correct, Mr.

Justice Brennan, as far as the suit is concerned, but they did
seek the application
Q

Well, what they wanted to do was take away from

you the security you now held under the garnishment —
MR. BELLs

That is correct

Q

— process, for the recovery of a judgment if

you have to do this.
MR. BELL;
Q

That's correct.

Isn't that it?

MR, BELL;

That’s precisely correct.

Now, that —
Q

Now, how should wo approach interpreting

proceedings in the State Court, strictly or —
MR. BELL;

I believe that Hill v„ Martin suggest-.?;

that, given the policy of 2283, that it needs to be a generous
construction, that the concern expressed in the statute is*,
for the operation of the State judicial system,
Q

You meari generous against jurisdiction?

MR. BELL;

Well, I think it requires a broad inter­

pretation, because of this —
Q

A broad interpretation against jurisdiction?

MR. BELL;
Q

I believe so.

Because I think the concern

I don't mean jurisdiction, I mean against —

MR. BELL;

Yes.

1 believe the concern is to permit,

if it’s appropriate to permit, the State proceedings to go on.
Now, one of the points made by the appellants is
that it is not incumbent to do so here, because there isn’t
any way to raise the question they want to raise in the State
Court, and X think that bears on this issue.
What they have said is that even if 2283 applies at

the outset, you have a situation in Connecticut where you
cannot raise the constitutional claims that they sought to rainin the Federal Court,

Where there is no relief in the State

proaass, then, 22$3 notwithstanding, the Federal Court should
have taken jurisdiction and should have proceeded.
We would dispute the availability of claims in the
— of remedies available in the S't&te Court.
Q

Incidentally, Mr. Bell» is the question before

is whether 1983 is an express exception?
MR. BELLs
Q

I believe -- I believe it is ---

I notice it was decided, apparently the Second

Circuit holds that it is not.
impress exception of 2283.
MR. BELL3

It does not recognise 1983 as an

But is that issue before us her®?

I believe that it is with the total 2283

issue, Your Honor,
Q

Yes.

MR. BELLj

But to dwell just a «tonent on State

remedies, if I may, because I believe that's an. important
point.

If there wore no remedies, nor procedures, nor processes

in Connecticut for raising the kinds of issues, then we might
have s. different kind of situation.
I would like to observe that you could raise exactly
the kind of issues in the pending State proceedings that were
in fact raised in the District Court,
1 am not dealing now with the preliminary relief --

39
Q

As to which7 with the creditors6 action?

MEo BELL;
Q

That’s correct# Mr. Justice Brennan„

How do you do that?

MB. BELL a

I believe if you sought an injunction in

the State Court proceeding, that is available by way of a
counterclaim —
Q

Well, the creditor brings a suit for recovery

on a note, isn't that what it was?
MR. BELL;
Q

Yes, sir.

And in that proceeding you are suggesting that

the defendant seek an injunction against the garnishment?
MR. BELL %

X am.

X am suggesting that the defendant

can raise, either by independent action or by counterclaim in
the State suit, an injunction based on the claimed deprivation
under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Connecticut also has a declaratory judgment process,
which is available to a defendant.
Q

That would be independent

that would be an

independent suit, wouldn't it?
MR, BELL*

It could either be by independent suit,

Mr* Justice Brennan, or by way of counterclaim.
How, the declaratory judgment is a little different
in this particular court.

The Circuit Court, in which these

actions lay, the Sixth Circuit Court, does not have declaratory
judgment jurisdiction*

You could raise it in a counterclaim,

40
as wa've noted in our brief, and then transfer it to
court of appropriate jurisdiction.
Q

The whole suit then, or just the counterclaim?

MR. BELL: Well, the whole action would follow.
Q

MX right.

MR. BELL: But the point is that under Connecticut
practice, both the injunctive relief is; available, and that is
within the jurisdiction of this precise Court, and the
declaratory relief is also available? and X believe that tha
law of the State of Connecticut assures it.
Reference has been made to Michael8 s Jewelers v.
Handy, which was a Sixth Circuit Court case, involving the sane
kinds of set of facts? that is, a garnishment response by a
defendant.
A motion for injunction was presented to the court
there, and that court addressed itself substantiveXy to the
constitutionality of the garnishment process in the light of
Snladach.

It held, on the merits, that it was constitutional?

and X suppose that settles, for tha time being, tha law of the
Sixth Judicial Circuit.
But the point is that the ease illustrates it can’t
come up by motion.

A better way, I submit, would have been to

have done so by counterclaim, or by the declaratory judgment
proceeding.
An even more effective device, I also suggest, comes

from 1983, the federal statute itself, which provides for a
civil cause of action for damages in the event of deprivation*
That lias, by way of counterclaim, in the same Sixth Circuit
Court, which has the unique advantage of avoiding any mootness
problem that we had in Toro, for instance.

You will recall the

companion to Lynch here involved a situation where the
garnishment was in fact released.
A civil cause of action by way of 1983, for which hhs
State Courts have concurrent jurisdiction to handle, avoids
very nicely the problem of mootness? and, combined with
injunctive request and combined with declaratory judgment,
permits the raising in exactly the same court below, the
Sixth Circuit Court in Mew Haven, Connecticut, of precisely
the issues that were sought to be presented to the Federal
Court in the claims that were brought to the three-judge court.
So X would say that the availability of Stateremedies in the State Courts makes it all the more Incumbent
for, under the 2233 policy, to have consideration for the
breadth of proceedings which are then pending and to permit
them to continue.
The constitutional issue has never been presented
to the Connecticut Supremo Court throughout the long history
of the garnishment process« The constitutional issue, both as
to the 0» S. Constitution and even under the-State of
Connecticut's Constitution, which is a brand new Constitution,

since 1965 when it adopted a new one.

Those are open issues

as far as the State is concerned, and the State Supreme Court
has never, in the light of Snlad&ch, examined this; process,
I believe all the more reason to construe the concept
of proceedings as it is construed in Kill v- liar tin will bear
the federal intervention and permit the State Court process
to continue.
The question of express exception to 22S3 is discussed
at length in our brief, and all I would say in conclusion is
that it is not just an exception, ■> it is an express exception,
which is required to 2283.

At least some reference in the

statute which takes cognisance of the problem of 'two pending
actions going on simultaneously, and tells on© or the other to
stay or to proceed.

There is no express reference in 1983 to

that problem.
There is no mention of the difficulties posed by two
pending actions, and no requirement that one or the other goes
forward, as is the case with virtually every one of those
express exceptions which have been historically noted to the
2283 statute.
X have not had occasion to discuss further the request
for declaratory relief, which was embodied here; tbs denial - of
the injunctive remedy below we believe takes care of that
request, as well, which was made.

Our position on that,

as

stated in tha brief, is that request for declaratory judgment

43
is essentially of the aasas effect as th© request for injunctive
relief, and w© believe that the prior decisions in cases so
hold .

•

Now, as to the Mi chad’s.. J ewe 1 e r s case, there the
appellate court, the appellata division of the Circuit Court
held that no appeal would lie from the refusal of the lower
court to dissolve the garnishment on the ground that it was
levied without notice or hearing.
The appellata court held that the Circuit Court, the
lower court, had no authority to entertain any relief? and
then it saids

But at any rat® Connecticut statutes providing

for prejudgment garnishment of account® is constitutional,
distinguishing Sniadach.

Q

Do you agree with your friend that your client

can assert counterclaim —
MR» LESSER?
Q

Na, I don’t —

— under

MR, LESSER?

S3 grounds?
I don't believe that a counterclaim would

lie in the Sixth Circuit Court action, where the creditor suit
is pending against Mrs. Lynch, Mr. Chief Justice»

a coir,:tor-

claim must bo related to the matter in demand is the way the
practice book reads.
I believe that Section .134 of the Connect!out practice
book —•
Q

You say it does not relate to the matter in

demand whan the counterclaim would be against the unlawful
act o£ garnishment «—
MR. LESSERs The garnishment would be unrelated to
the complaint that's alleged, that is, the claim of Household
Finance Corporation that money is due and. owing from a noto»
The only case I’ve been able to find was the case
?
called the Bank v. Riley, reported in 12 Conn. Stipp», in which
it was held that a counterclaim in those circumstances would
not lie.
But, at any rate, it would seem that the issues in
the Circuit Court have been settled by Michael's Jewelers one
way or anotherx

either the court cannot entertain the complaint,

the motion to dissolve the garnishment, or if it can, if it

can setter tain it, nevertheless garnishment is still
constitutional.
And let me simply refer the Court to our Reply Brief,
at pages 23 and 24, in which we cat out the substantial cost of
litigating in the Connecticut courts, in order to bring a suit
for declaratory judgment.

For example, it is necessary, as a

jurisdictional requirement, to notify all interested parties,
which carries a substantial cost.
How, tha Connecticut Supreme Court has, during all the
years of this century, affirmed the constitutionality of
summary prejudgment garnishmentj not since Sniadach, that9&
true, but in the Miehae1 *s Jewslers case the appellate court
opinion, the appellate court did not certify that a substantial
question of law was issyolyed, thereby making an appeal to the
Connecticut Supreme Court impossible.
What occurred in that case was, I suppose, an
equivalent of certiorari.

The debtor filed a petition for

certification to the Connecticut Supreme Court, but that was
naver acted 'upon, because then the creditor withdrew his
underlying damage suit.
1 would finally like to state that a lasher in not 3

neither is the sheriff.

The sheriff is acting under the

instructions of the lawyer, who, under decisions of the
Connecticut Supreme Court, has full absolute discretion in

and

levying the writ of garnishment.

I refer the Court

to

in Vol. 143 of Connecticut Reports.
We also state in our brief that even if the garnish­
ment represents ten abuse of process, the State Court is barred
from releasing that garnishment *
Thus» under Kill v. Martin, we would say that there
is no action by the court or any of its ministerial officers«
