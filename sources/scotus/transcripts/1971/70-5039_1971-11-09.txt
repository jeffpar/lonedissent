P R O C B E D' X £3 G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE SURGES;

We will hear arguments

next in Mo. 5039, Puentes against Shevin and others.
Mr. Abbott, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF C, MICHAEL'ABBOTT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ABBOTT;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court;
If X may, Your Honor, I would like to reserve five
minutes of my time for rebuttal.
The nature of feh© case before the Court now

la a

challenge to the Florida projudgment replevin statute on
procedural due process and Fourth Amendment search and seizure
grounds.
The issues ©re twofold.

Simply stated;

whether the

Florida pr©judgment replevin procedure, in which a writ is
issued without notice and prior hearing, violates the
procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendmentj and,
secondly, whether the same procedure, insofar as it commands
a State officer to enter a private dwelling by force if
necessary, violates search and seizure provisions of the Fourth
Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth.
The lower court held, with one judge dissenting, that
the Florida prejudgment replevin statutes were constitutional.
The facts of the case can be briefly stated;

4
The appellant, Margarita Fusntes, separately purchased
e stove artd & stereo from the appallav, Firestone Tire and
Rubber Company, in 1967 under retaining title contracts.

These

contracts were then consolidated into one agreement»
Margarita. Puentes has complained to Firestone on a
number of occasions about mechanical difficulties with her
stove; appellee Firestone indicates that those difficulties
had been repaired.

Margarita Fuentes alleges that they have

not»
For that reason she began withholding payments on her
contract in April of 1969»

In May of that year Firestone sent

her a telegram threatening imminent repossession.

Four and a

half months later, on September 15th, they filed an affidavit
and a bond pursuant to the Florida statute and replevied her
property„
The execution writ was executed on the same day,
September 15th, by a deputy sheriff of Dade County, over her
protest

and the protests of her relatives.
The appellant then filed the instant action in the

court below in November of 1969*. The Dade County Small Claims
Court, on our motion, agreed to stay that action pursuant to
-tile conclusion of this action; and on August 24th, the threejudge court below held that neither of these — that this
statutory procedure did not violate either the Fourth or the
Fourteenth Amendments

Now, with regard to fcha issue of procedural duo process,
our position can be stated very simply.

If you look over the

breadth of the due process cases that have com© before this
Court, conceiving that it is a flexible concept, nevertheless,
one rul© has emerged, and that is that:

absent special

circumstances involving a compelling governmental interest,
that no one may be deprived of a significant property interest
prior to having a chance to protest the taking.
That’s what this Court said in Sniadach and reaffirmed
it in Boddie vs. Connecticut.

Mr. Justice Brennan said it again

in Ba11 vs. Burson„
Now, if you look at the Florida procedure, usually an
affidavit is filed, although it is not now required under the
Florida statute, but it was filed in this case.

It is fch©

usual procedure to file an affidavit that indicates the claimant
is lav/fully entitled to the property.

That is the only

allegation he must make.

•

He files a complaint, a bond in double the value of
the property, and the clerk issues a writ without any judicial
inquisition^ simply a ministerial act, he issues the writ
without notice and a hearing, gives it to the sheriff, the
sheriff takes it to the home and executes it on the property.
y

He files a bond in double the amount of the

value of the property?
MR. ABBOTT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

6
y

And he*s the one who asserts the value of the

property?
MR» ABBOTTs

That is correct»

And there is no examination of whether this is true
or not.
Now, we submit that the Florida procedure displays
the same types of constitutional deficiencies that this Court
found lacking in Sniadach vs. Family Finance Corporation»
There is no evidence indicating the validity or the probable
validity of the claim prior to the taking.

The statute is

not nearly drawn to certain circumstances that may be of
extreme interest to the creditor.

There is no need for the

creditor to allege a particular stated interest that is of
concern to him.
And it. is the use of the property here as well as in
SnJLjadach that is of concern.

It is the use of the property

itself as the property under the Fourteenth Amendment we‘re
talking about.
As a matter of fact, the contract between Margarita
Puentes and Firestone Stores is simply this?

that she says,

"I will pay you more money than the cash price of these goods
over a period of time in order that I might have the goods
immediately.

That's exactly what I*m paying for?

for the use of those goods.

I’m paying

I agree to pay you finance

charges sc that :X might have them now.

And it is the use of

7
the goods that she is entitled to until she defaults»
But here under this procedure there is no need for
Firestone to prove that she has in fact defaulted on this
procedure»

They can corns and get it any time they think they

■want it back, for whatever reason.
Q

What is the bond for?

And under what circumstances can the purchaser use it?
MR. ABBOTTi

Tha bond is under the condition that

if Firestone should be proven wrong, she can thereafter reach
that bond and collect on it.

Of course, the bond doss nothing

to establish the validity of the claim.

The bond does nothing

to mitigata deprivation between the taking and the trial.
Q

But dees it indicate at all that what Firestone's

claim is, that there is a default?
MR. ABBOTT:

No, I don't think no*

X mean, there's

no indication in the claim itself, no one makes an examination,
of whether there is or is not a default.
One can argue that by filing & bond you're going to
deter a frivolous claim; that if on® has to file a bond you'll
deter those people who don't have a proper claim.
Q

Did Firestone have to file anything in court

prior to taking the goods that in any way indicated there was
a default?
MR* ABBOTT:

No.

All they have to file is something

to indicate they are lawfully entitled to it.

Now, to; the

3
extent on© reads that as anything in default, I suppose yes.
But there’s no examination.
Q

What’s the condition of the bond, though, that

if Firestone doesn’t prove what?
MR. ABBOTT:

If Fireston© than doesn’t prove at the

time this comes to trial that they are lawfully entitled to
it, Mrs. Puentes raises defenses that show that Firestone is
not, then if she can show damages she can reach th© bond.
But, in the first instance, they have to shew nothing; all
they have to do is file an affidavit that is already pre­
written, that says "I am lawfully entitled to the property".
It seems to me that what w© have to focus on in tills
case ares

What are the State interests her© that ar© compelling,

that require Firestone to need this kind of summary procedure?
Q

Well, is it possible that the perishable nature

of the merchandise, the fact that it’s rather a. rapidly wasting
asset have something to do with that?
MR. ABBOTTs

If they could show that, I think that

might be significant, Your Honor.

In fact, it’s interesting

to not© here that in April when she withheld her first payment
they sent her a notice? in May they sent her a telegram saying
"We’re going to repossess within 24 hours if you don’t startpaying .ee
Then they waited four and a half months before they
actually issued th© writ.

'3
Q

You aren't complaining about, that, are you?

MR. ABBOTTs

No.

The only point I'm trying to make

is that if they’re actually interested in getting the property,
because of the deteriorating value, why did they wait this
length of time before going after it?
I think what they really wanted here# they wanted the
money.

By taking the property first, they gain an additional
*

bit of leverage over that period of time to try to coerce, her
into paying, whether she may have valid defenses or not.
I think that's the point to be made.
It seems to.me, though, if on® looks at the interest
that the appellees put forward m compelling this procedure,
there is simply no indication that it is necessary for them to
do this.

The State of Florida says that, it's the protection of

property for the citizens 'that is of compelling interest here?
but, of course, our position would be they're emphasising the
rights of one class of citizens, that is to say creditors, over
another class of citizens, such as debtors.
They also say, well, it's the economic Ufa of the
community that's at stake her®.

As a matter of fact, however,

there is no evidence at all indicating there is any relationship
between attachment type remedies and the availability of credit.
The California Supreme Court was recently faced with
?

this same issue just last month, in Randcmi vs. Appellate
Department, and they rejected it.

And they said:

there is no

10
evidence her® that there is any relationship between the
attachment of property like this and the availability of credit»
Further, we not.® that there are some critical studies that
indicate that there are

there it no relationship

between

these two factors.
So if, in fact, Firestone is restricted, what's going
to happen?
Well, th® only evidence before this Court, indicating
that, there’s going to be any damage to Firestone at all, is an
affidavit by Firestone’s own National Manager of Retail Credit
in Akron, Ohio.

And the lower court reindicated a counter-”

affidavit by Professor William F. Willyor of th® National
Consumer Loss Center in Boston.

We didn't even submit that

for th© record in this Court, because we don’t feel that either
of these- affidavits give the Court the kind of hard data on
which you could comfortably rely and say, Yes, in fact there
f

is going to b© an economic deprivation to the life of the
community,
/

But let’s go one step further, let’s assume that
replevin is essential to consumer credit.

It seems t© me that

one can make th© argument that, to the extent you give debtors
or creditors a relatively inexpensive and expeditious remedy,
such as we have here, to that extent it just encourages them
to overextend.

I mean, maybe they're giving credit to people

that shouldn't have credit

11
How, is? that in the interest of the citizens of
Florida?

I don’t think so.
Our research showed that on© out of five people simply

default on these things.

They gust never show up,once their

property is taken they think it’s gone.
significant.

I think that’s

One out of every five people.

I suspect that's low for the national average; I
suspect it's much higher than that.

I think if you look at

tii® studies of Dr. Caplovitse that was? mentioned this morning
in the Swarfo case, you will find that nationally th© default
rate is much higher*

But in Florida it happens to b© cm out of

five o
So I don’t think they can show that even if to assum®
that they're going t© be hart, I don't think they can show that

consumer

credit itself is related to the public interest*
?
Th© Anakjnds case say that in addition to this

there is a public interest in the conservation of stats
resources.

Well, that may b® true.

They?re assuming that

a prehearing procedure is going to take mar© resources than
there is now.
case.

X mean, there's going t© be a trial in this

There's supposed to b® a trial*

But ©imply by having

th© hearing first, doss not necessarily indicata that you're
going to hav© to spend more State money.
I think only in the few casas where you have a
really compelling interest, whore you can show, for example.

that the debtor is about to take the property out of fcli©
jurisdiction» or he is going to probably fraudulently convey
it to a third person» or that it's rapidly deteriorating in
value, those are the type of cases where you might want to
have some kind of a summary procedure.
But ©van then you can still do it ora probable
validity» you don’t have to just give it to them and say vra
believe you.

You can say» you know» what is the evidence that

you have a right to this property?
situation -that you need it now?

What is the current,

Then» okay» we’ll let you

take it.
Q

Is it a criminal offense to move this type of

property without notice to the legal owner?
MR. ABBOTTs

I suspect it probably is» Your Honor»

although that relates somewhat to the concealment of property
under lien statute in Florida» which» as Fireston® has pointed
out» in the opinion of the Attorney General» that state is
no longer valid.
Aside from that particular statuto» I am just not
sure if there are other statutes indicating it is & misdemeanor
to move th© property.
Q

I just don’t know.

Well» the movability of tills property» the

portability» perhaps I should say» does that have some relation­
ship to the right of summary remedy?
for summary proceedings?

Does that enlarge the need

13
MR, ABBOTT?

It seems to art© it might- if you

could show that in fact yon had that fear, that in fact they
thought Margarita Puentes was going to move the property.
q

well, you don*t -*«* do yon make that kind of a

decision on an ad hoc basis, or do you make that on the basis
©f th© generality?
MR. ABBOTTs

If you had evidence to show that there

was sos® reason to make that evident, that evidence, you know,
on the broad basis, X think, you know, there would be a point

there.
The whole point that we make is that there is no
evidence indicating that the large number of debtors

in

fact, what Firestone says in their own brief, at page 18,
they say "in the vast majority of these cases" — and that’s
their language, not. mine — "in the vast majority of these
cases" th® debtors will voluntarily relinquish the property.
They give it up freely.
They also point out that the default rat© in all
consumer installment contracts of this kind is 1*76 percent.
Way below th© types of defaults that consumers are having,
when they just don't show up.

I mean, we're talking about a

very narrow portion of th© total consumer contracts.

There is

no evidence ©van indicating that that small portion, there *s
going to be a large number who are going to abscond with the
property.

.14

In fact, if anyone wants to abscond, ifc 3©©roa to m®
he has a lot of opportunity to do so, prior to the time of the
hearing,

X mean, Firestone, jest like, any other creditor,

begins t© go through this debt collection process once they
think there is a default.

You know, they sent Margarita Fran ten

& letter; they sent her a telegram.

And if she really wants

to get away with the proparty, it seems to me she*a going 'to
do it then,

And she knows, eventually, they may coma to get it,

it seems to ma.
But if she has a default, she's simply not -- if sh©
thinks she has not defaulted, she's simply not willing to give
ifc up.

X mean, it's her property, why should she?
But there's just no evidence over the broad basis

of — to indicate that Firestone needs this kind of protection.
That they just can't provide it there, and they haven't provided
it.
Q

So you would not. be satisfied if Firestone,

before repossession, was required to g© be-fore a judicial
officer and establish what we might, for want of better
language, call probable cause, or reasonable grounds to believe
that there has been a default; exhibit the contract or fch© not®
or whatever it is; and an affidavit that there has been a
default.

And you wouldn't be satisfied if a judicial officer

were required to sign the' writ of replevin?
MR. ABBOTTs

I would not, Your Honor, because X

15

think what would happen, it would quickly become & rubberstamp procedure.
Q

Yes,

8© you aay that there must — it cannot

be don© esc parte in any way, no matter what —
MR, ABBOTTj
Q

Only in th© narrow circumstances where **

Yes .

MR* ABBOTTz
compelling reason.

they can show probability and a

But these are sometimes very complex issues.

Now, if you take, a look at the brief of the National Consumer
law Center, on© of the things that's interesting in this case
is that it fears that the security interest that Firestone had
in the stove had expired at the time they got it.

That is to

say that any rational allocation of payment between the stereo
and the stove, Mrs. Puentes had paid off that stove when they
cams and took it.
And that is not a type of defense that a judge would
simply look in the contract and see.

She's got to have a

chance to coma in and say, you know, I've paid for that stove
already? Firestone has broached their warranty ©£ repair.
A judge, just by himself, would not make that kind of a deter­
mination .
Finally, it seams to me
at the Fourth Amendment issue.

I'd like to look briefly

Under the Florida procedure,

the writ commands the officer, State officer, or deputy sheriff
in our case, to enter by force if necessary and to make a

15
reasonable exploration of the dwelling in order to find the
property.
Now, the problem we have with that is agains

what

is the compelling state interest that Firestone has in allowing
© deputy sheriff not only to enter but to enter by force if
necessary?
Now, if you look a balancing test, which this Court
has don© in the past, it- seems to me yon have to weigh th®
interest of Firestone against the invasion which that search
entailso

If w® agree, as Mr. Justice White said in Camara,

that you're going to hav® as much of a disturbance in a civil
seizure m you are in a criminal seizure, it seems to m© that
you hav© to allege a very substantial state interest before you
can go into that home.
Again, the statute is that narrowly drawn, there is
no advance notice that they're coming here, in comparison with
Wyman ys,_James, resistance is a misdemeanor in comparison with
W^man- where if the welfare recipient wanted to refuse, she
could.

There's no wav to refuse her©, the sheriff is going to

go in whether you refuse or not.
If you. look \i|fc the facts in this case, Margarita
Fuantes did everything one could expect & private citizen to do,
short of actually physically obstructing the sheriff.

3h©

told him, sh© stopped him at the door, sh® called her son-in-lawJ
the son-in-law who-speaks English, which sh® does notp explains

17
to the sheriff that ho could' not tsk© the property; and tha
sheriff comes back and says?
fchas’s my obligation".

csI'v© got to taka the properf/?

Only at that point did she let him into -

fch© house.
Q

Would your case b© any different if the stereo

were not kept at her home but in a little grocery store that
©lie ran?
MR. ABBOTT:

I don't think so, Your Honor, unless

there was some evidence feo indicate that she was attempting
to conceal it.

If Firestone indicated, you know,

'V© don't

know where it is, w© can't find it? she refuses to indicate that
she still has it, in order to make us feel secure", then tfeay
may have an interest.
Q

But that's of course not this case.

Well, you're giving so much emphasis to the

home, as? such, and I wondered if that factor is influential
in your case.
MR. ABBOTT:
Q

Simply the fact that it's ;in the homo*

Yes. ■

MR. ABBOTT:

But to the exten-fc-tKat the property is

located in a public dwelling, where they may have a eh©nee to
enter anyway, it seems to me that one could make a less
compelling claim.
Of course that's not the statute, and the statuta
doesn’t cover special situations like that.
q

now,

you're assuming that the standard that is

18
applicable her© is that of compelling state interest.

Is this

established?
MR. ABBOTT*

It seems to me, under the du© process

oases of this Court* it is established.
Switching back t© the procedural duo process issue*
for example* if you look at the cases that were cited in
Sniadach* all of those cases dealt with the compelling State
interest* you know, Fahey vs. Mailone© —
Q
different.

Yes* indeed* they did* but the facts were
And l*m asking whether this one comas within the

factual range ©f those cases?

They must* in your view, I

take it?
MR. ABBOTTs

It seems to me it comes within the

general principies* yes.

I mean, it seems to me Firestone has to

a how soma reason why -they need this procedure.
Q

Maybe your opposition won’t agree to that?

MR. ABBOTT $
0

I suspect they will not, Your Honor.

If the statute permitted the count©r~boad that

is present in cn© of the other cases we8re hearing* would
you say that ~~
me.

ABBOTTs This statute does have a counter-bond*

Your Honor.
Q

It doss?

MR. ABBOTT*
Q

Yes* it doas.

Then the process can be stopped, can't it* by

19
complot© protection —
MR. ABBOTT; Well, as a matter of fact, X think one
of the things that is also interesting, if you look at, the
record her©, it appears that in fact what the sheriff is
supposed to do, he’s supposed to take this property and hold it
for three days, and give Mrs. F«entes a chance to peat «
counter-bond.
Well, in 'th© first place, there is no notice to her
that she has that opportunity.

2 mean, only if she has a

lawyer who can tell her within the 72 hours that assists will
she over foe likely to do it.
We examined 442 cases, in fact, in the Dade County
Small Claims Court, and w© found that nobody ever, in that
entire year, over posted a counter-bond.
Q

I didn’t ~~ X hsard whet you just said now,

that you examined well over 400 cases and found nobody did it.
X didn’t hear what you said a little earlier,

Was there any

notice to the debtor, to th® vendor that he has this opportunity
of filing a bond?
ME. ABBOTTs
Q

To the debtor, there’s no notice —

To Mrs, Fuentes in this case.

MR, ABBOTT;

No, there’s no notice to Mrs. Fuentas

that slm has that opportunity.
On© ©f the other interesting things is that even
though the sheriff is supposed to hold this property for three

20
days, it appears from tbs record below that actually the
proparty went directly to Firasfcon©, that Firestone accomy. ani©d
the sheriff in their trucki Firestone took the property, not
tli© sheriff»

They took it immediately, fchay didn’t wait three;

days.
Q
Mrs» Fuentas?

Well, what other — what wore tbs remedies of
On® was to file a bond in feh-a same amount as

had been filed by Firestone?
MR. ABBOTT:
Q

That's correct.

That's correct.

And then what would have happened?

MR. ABBOTTs

If she had filed the bond, and if the

sheriff was still holding the property, then she had a chance
to get it back until the trial.
Of course, one ©£ the other things we found is that
Q

Until tha trial on what?

So far there's no

complaint been filed.
MR. ABBOTTt

Ye®, there is a complaint in the Florida

procedure, there's not in the Pennsylvania procedure.

There's a complaint on what?

MR. ABBOTT: That's correct.

MR. ABBOTTs

That's right.

And that's a condition precedent to the -~

MR. ABBOTTi
Q

That's right.

MR. ABBOTTs

Th© affidavit, they're entitled to it

hut nobody ever looks to see what th© complaint says.

But

they d© have to file one.
Q

And then, is a copy of the complaint served on

Mrs. Fuontes?
MR. ABBOTTs

It is at th® time the property is taken;

there's no previous notice.

At th© sams time th® sheriff take*?

th© property, he says, "Here's th© affidavit, here's th©
complaint.”
Q

And then if she file© a bond in an amount equal

to that filed by Firestone, in this case, by the plaintiff,
then the sheriff continuas to hold th© property, does ho?
MR. ABBOTT % Well, lie's supposed to.

I don't think he

did in this case.
Q

Well, V7hat does th® law provide?

MR. ABBOTTs

He's supposed to hold th® property for

threa days, and give fear th® chance to film her bond.
Of course, what v;a have found is that —
Q

Yesf file fear bond, and than how long does ah®

have to make an answer to th© complaint?
MR.' ABBOTT-5 Then sh® has th© normal fcias to make an
answer,
g

But if she files th® bond, she gets th® property

back?
MR. ABBOTT %

Assuming the sheriff has it, that’s

correct.
Q

she gets it back?

Q

Yea.
•,

.......

MR. ABBOTT:
q

She gets the proparty back until trial—

You told ms it remained in th® custody of the

sheriff.
MR. ABBOTTs

No, no, no.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Th® sheriff is supposed to hold it for three days before h©
gives it to Firestone.

Now, if she doesn't fil© a bond, he

then gives it to Firestone.
Q

But if she does?

MR. ABBOTTs

If sh® does file a bond, he then gives

it bade to Margarita Fuentes.

Of course, our research chows

that, nobody ever files a bond
q

Well, we're talking about the law of Florida.

MR. ABBOTTs That's right.

That there is that provision

fcher©
It's also interesting to note, I think, though, that
in order to file this type of a bond you've got to put forth
the full amount, full cash value of th© property.

Firestone

can fil© their bond with* about on® porcent of th© total that
they're charging, say, $200 here.

Mrs. Fuonfces, on a forth"»

coining bond, is going to have to file the full cash value,
$200, plus a premium.
If Mrs. Fusntes

were a plaintiff, they wouldn't; make

no distinction, ah® could then file a on® percent bond.

MR. ABBOTT:

On the part cf the debtor, correct.

MR. ABBOTT:

Ko, she's not informed.

That's correct.

That's correct, Your

Finally, I'd briefly just like to run over what the
lower court, held.
One of th® things they said is that it seems fco them
that Firestone ~~ that Mrs. Puentes may have waived her rights.
It's a little unclear from th.© opinion.

But it appears that

they8re saying that since the contract reads that in the event
of default of any payments, since Mrs. Puentes has admitted
that BhB withheld payments, therefore, that gives Firestone
th© right to the property.

I think that is m incorrect

assertion ©£ Florida law.
Our whole position during the whole litigation has
been that default is a technical word.
breach ©f legal obligation.

Default indicates

New, if Firestone has breached

their warranty as she says they have, under the Uniform

21
Commercial Code in Florida, ah© has a right to suspend bar
payments.

That is her right.
Therefor®, if she has a right to suspend payment,

sh© cannot be in default.
If 'tiie contract said, in the event of an omission of
payment, Firestone is entitled to repossession; than they'd
have a stronger case*

Xfc doesn't say that? it says, in tfes

©vent of default in payment.
There can be no default unless one proves that there
is technical default,

tod that has not bean proved here.

Likewise the court below says that we're here dealing
with a peaceable entry into her home.

It seems to me that,

with dua deference to the lower court, that is misleading.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT T. SCHWARTS, ESQ.,
DM BEHALF OF APPELLEE SHEVIN
MR. SCHWARTS s

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the courts
I am Herbert Schwartz, Deputy Attorney General of the
State of Florida.

I represent, the appellee, Robert L. She via.,

the Attorney General of Florida? and Mr. George Wright, cocounsel, will be representing appellee Firestone, and ha and
I will equally divide the argument.
1 should first like to address some ramarks to the

comments of the appellant as to the facts„

Thera is a

stipulated set of facts in the Appendix, which indicate that
the deputy sheriff may or may not have been refused entry.
*

The appellees, and the testimony that was taken at
the hearing before the three-judge court, indicated that the
deputy sheriff was admitted to the home peaceably, and he didn't
force his way in at ail.
Nor was this a type of entry that comas under the
sheriff appearing in the doorway and the force of law behind

MR, SCHWARTSs
Q

That’s correct, Your Honorf ha did,

And that meant to anybody with any reasonable

sens© that he had the whole power of the State of Florida
behind him?
MR. SCHWARTSz

I would say yes. Your Honor, -that’s

a reasonable assumption? yes.
Q

Thank you.

MR. SCHWARTS s

Tha State ©£ Florida is a real party

of interest in this case, and the State does assart a real value
to this statute,

It is more

it is mors» than tha state of

Florida merely siding with a eroditor, because in the proper
circumstances w© would take whichever side were just and
equitable in defending our sfc&tut©.
But we do have a valuable interest in keeping creditor
and debtor peace between the two.

It is to the interest of

th© State oi Florida that we prevent and provide ways to keep

32
psopl® from resorting to self-help, such r,s brooking in and
seising the property and perhaps altercations over it.
So the reason for the replevin statute in the State
of Florida is simply stated in our brief, to take th@ property
©rid to custodially descend, to let the two, the creditor and
.the debtor, to have it out in court.

Because, 2 hop® the

Court.got the distinct impression, because it would be a true
impression, that everything that is done in Florida in the
replevin statute must bo don© by a court.

There is no

prothonotary doing anything.
Thor© is only officers of the circuit court, or the
■the court that has-■jurisdiction.

During the issuing of papers

and the hearing, only a judge -Q

Wall, who issues the writ of replevin?

MR. SCHWARTZ;

An officer of the court, a clerk does

all ~
Q

Yes, but a judge never signs it.

MR. SCHWARTS;

Ho, not sign it, but before a default

can be entered or a judgment entered on the default —
Q

Well, I understand that, but fch© writ of

replevin is not issued by a judge, and fch® judge never sees
any of fch® basis for the issuance of the writ.
MR. SCHWARTZ;

No, Your Honor,

But ultimately fch®

matter is disposed of by a court, before anybody gets fch©
property.

And indeed, the clerk must b© satisfied, and in our

33
Stata clerks are officers of the court# I'm not sure he*? thvy
are in other States.

But he must he satisfied that th© bend is

in proper form# and that the complaint is in proper form# and
that the papers are in quite correct order# and that's the last
tiding fcho ministerial officer of the court, has to do wifca it.
From then on it's before th© court.

And no disposition of tha

case can be had without th© court doing something.
I think there8s a very interest in th® conservation
of judicial time and energy to be had in th® method that th®
statute envisions, and that it will take a great deal of
judicial time and energy for a party to coma before the court
of competent jurisdiction, to get the writ of replevy.
Especially, as Mr. Abbott says# in an adversary hearing.
Certainly that would consume even mors than the

ex parte type of hearings suggested by the Court in questioning.
And 1 think the State of Florida dees have a vary
appropriate interest in preserving th® economic viability of
the installment credit system.

So there really is, as the State of Florida sees it#
two major concepts involved her®.
One is th© vary basic underlying question that the
State poses, and that is, our right to legislate in this
statutory scheme of replevin, a writ that is ovar 700 years
old, and somehow th® appellants would have you believe that
the viability and vitality of the writ of replevin somehow

34
ended when the deputy sheriff stepped on the front porch of Mrs.
Fuantes s house.
Q

Mr. Schwartz, back in common law if, was ex parte,

wasn't it, with replevin?
MR. SCHWARTZs
U

Yes, Your Honor, it was.

It was strictly ex parte, and then you had,

what is if, a writ of abendo returno or something, that you
filed upon, if you wanted it back.
MR. SCHWARTZ s
Q

That was ex part©, wasn*t it?

MR. SCHWARTZ s
sir.

It evolved ~

It evolved t© that. Your Honor? yas,

Ye§, Your Honor, that's correct.
The common law history of the writ is wall known to

this Court, and it is detailed in our brief that this is a
viable common law institution that has been engrafted on our
constitutional scheme of lav/, and on© that has withstood the
test of time.

It is not to be abandoned, the state of Florida

feels, simply because it's old.

Certainly the older the lav/ the

more firmly rooted it is in our jurisprudence.
Q

Could, under Florida law, Firestone have

repossessed without getting a writ of replevin at all?

Just

use self-help, if it could have done it peacefully?
MR, SCHWART.Z,s

That would not be satisfactory to the

State, Your Honor,
Q

Well, not to the Stats, but how about under the

35
Florida statute?
MR. SCHWARTS;

Mo, Your Honor, that would not satisfy

feu© statute.
Q

A secured creditor cannot —~ there cannot be

wholly private repossessions by a secured creditor in Florida?
MR. SCHWARTZ;

Wot under tins statute, Your Honor,

there cannot be.
I am sure, sure as I'm standing hare, that automobile
lending institutions do it, when they find the car on the
street, will take it.

I'm not saying that we sanction that,

but I'm sure that goes on.

We're not involved in any type of

case like that, nor would we bo.

This is purely and simply

our statutory replevin action that we're seeking to defend.
X think there's another paramount and overriding
issue that is before the Court, and that is, just how farreaching is the doctrine of Sniadach or Goldberg?

X think the

appellant in this case tries to view and characteris® this
case in a vacuum,
facts.

separately and apart from its operative

The facts are that Firestone, -under our replevin
>
if'

statute and under, -its contract, had an absolute right to
possess the exact same specific property that they went and
got,.

It is not so ethereal or abstract right of judgment that

they're seeking to execute on, and therefore garnish Mrs.
Sniadach*s wages or stop Mr. Kelly's welfare payments; those
things that are a peculias type ©f property, those things that

36
are needed fer fc-he lifeblood of a family.
But the appellant speaks hare it. conclusionary terms,
without any real facts to support those conclusions,
speaking — this case is on© of abstraction* really* in regard
to Mrs. Fuentes, because the factual basis is on© that wholly
supports the reasonableness and the rationality of the Florida,
statute* that it was a peaceful repossession.

She has all the

defenses available to her at the time and place when they
reasonably can be presented,- and the appellant here would have
this Court engraft on our law exactly what this Court has said
it won’t do many tiroes* and that is, make due process of law
some fixed, mechanistic principle, without regard to the
facts under which it is operating in a given case.
And X believe the attack on the Florida statute is a
very broad-brush treatment ©f storm and fury that really, in a
real sens®, attacks the very system of which Mrs. Fuentes is
a beneficiary.
Because the system is orderly, it has a great deal of
rationality to it.

She, Mrs. Fuentes, upon repossession could

have a quick hearing on the merits? she could post a bond? and
also, if this statute were abused at the hearing, and she laid
the predicate to establish the abuse of -the procedure, she
has her civil recourses to,misuse of process, the civil actions
for harassing creditor techniques and tactics.

She could take

Firestone into court and get damages from them for this

37
harassment, and far misuse of process:, if ahs could establish
that this was indeed the case.
So, the fact that the statute has not been abunad
speaks of its rationality.

And X think also the fact that

people know when they buy something on an : iaBt.tllr.ent basis
that they're obliged to pay for it, and they know - that if they
don't pay for it, it's going to get taken back by the seller.
So, Mrs. Puentes is in not a precarious position.
Indeed, the record shows that she had been a credit and
installment purchaser of this very same Firestone store several
times before over a period of years.

She had established a

credit rating with them, and that if she really had some
defense to raise as to breach of warranty, the placa to do it
was before the court in a proper manner, in a proper case, and
the forum was there for her to us©.
Certainly Mrs. Sniadach's wages cannot be mad©
analogous to Mrs. Puentes’ stereo set.

Mrs. Sniadach's wages

were the lifeblood of her family, they were that, to quote this
Court, "specialised type of property presenting distinct
problems in our society®.
family could not exist.

Without Mrs. Sniadsen's wages, her
Without Mr. Kelly's welfare payments,

being cut off, his family could not have existed.
Money represents those tilings that i© a specialised

Q

Mr. Schwarts, I suppose it's hard to conceive of

it, but suppose this installment purchase instead of being for
a stereo and a rang© had been for peaches or foodstuffs or
something, then would we foe closer t© Snladagh and Kelly?

39
MRe SCHWARTS»: This is procisaly the point, Your Honor.
You would become very close to -those specialized types of
property that ware the sublet matter of Sniadach &nd Kelly,
I» those cases, X would certainly say they might very well .ba

Q .

And you would have us draw the line ad hoc, then,

between thes® types of cases?
MR. SCHWARTSs

Your Honor, the State of Florida says

that if you don't, if you don't, what this Court will be doing
will be deciding replevin cases ad infinity» as to precis
property, which property does corno under Sniadach and Kelly end
which property does not, on a case~to-cas£K basis.
Th© operative facts, 1 think — in summary, the
operative facts show th© State's interest is to got between
the debtor and th© creditor and that this process, which is set
up by the Florida statutes, does meat those rudimentary standards
of fairness and due process that have been so often enunciated
by this Court.

And that to change th© Florida statutes, in

effect would be to throw a monkey wrench into the works of an
orderly State process and an economic process in which both
parties ax© eminently aware of their rights and duties.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well, Mr. Schwarts.
Mr. Wright

40
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. WRIGHT, JR., ESQ.,
OK BEHALF .OF APPELLEE, FIRESTONE
MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chi®£ Justice, and may it picas© tha

Court s
Before proceeding fco discuss the appellants * du©
process complaints as they relate to this casa, I would like to
clarify on® or two matters that have been heretofore discussed
by counsel for appellants.
He has asserted in argument before the Court that
there were complaints about the performance cf the stove in
question, and has asserted her© in oral argument that that was
the reason, for Mrs. Puentes withholding payment on the install­
ment contract.
•Whan we were requested by the three-judge federal
court below to confer for the purpose of stipulating to as many
facts as we could to ease the burden of that court in resolving
this case, Mr. Abbott, counsel for the plaintiff, asserted,
and it's reflected in the stipulation, that he made a contention
that there was soma difficulty with the stove and that his
client was not satisfied with the repairs that ware made by
Fireston©.
Because of the fact that such assertion was mad© by
counsel in that stipulation, the three-judge federal court
below set down an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of
allowing either or both parties to this cause to adduce before

that court evidence on

©ny

able to be stipulated.

matters on which they

may

not be-

At that evidentiary hearing, despite

inquiry by that court of Mr. Abbott, he declined to adduce any
evidence to support Ills unsupported contentions that th© stove
was in fact defective or had not been properly repaired.
There is nothing in this record to reflect in ori
iota that the reason for Mrs. Puentes withholding payment for
th© stove or for th© merchandise purchased wan because of ©
defect or a failure to properly repair.
The next point I would like t© mention in respect t©
a factual statement, and that is as to th© Fourth Amendment
contention.

Counsel for appellant implies and has throughout

his brief implied that there may have been sob® forcible entry
in th© service ©f th© particular replevin writ here involved.
That is a far cry from the undisputed facts her©.
Not only was there a peaceable repossession, the
deputy himself was invited in to th© Puentes * home.

There is

only a dispute as to the time of the invitation of the deputy
into th© home, but there is no dispute, and it is conceded that
prior t© th® actual service of 'the writ, the - deputy was invited
in to the Puentes * home.
There was no objection by Mrs. Fuentes herself,
there was a question raised by her daughter-in-law, who
happened to be in the home with her, about the right of th©
sheriff to repossess th® merchandise.

The sheriff awaited the

42
daughter-in-law's call to Mrs» Fuantes' son-in-law# who then
sought the advice of counsel.

And the sheriff stood there

during this period of time# which must have been scene 30 minutes
or so when all this was going on, and the son-in-law cam© to tht
home and advised the sheriff that he had talked with hi*

counsel

and that his counsel said he could not take back the ir.©rcfeiindir.$
unless there was an actual court proceeding pending.
At which point# of course# the deputy explained that
there was a court proceeding pending# at which point all parties:
involved retracted and failed to raise any objection to the
repossession of the merchandise.
On© matter I would also like t© clarify —
Q

Well# was tha complaint in replevin —

MR. WRIGHT i There -was a complaint in —
Q

— given to her then?

MR. WRIGHTS

Yes, sir.

And the complaint in replevin# Mr. Justice Whit/34

..

stated the basis of the claim# that is# that she had defaulted
on the installment contract for the purchase of the stove# and

it was asserted what her default was and the balance owed upon
that obligation# m reflected by the contract.
Q

She had to have it.

So she —

Wes that complaint filed

in connection with getting the bond# the replevin bond?
MR. WRIGHTs

Y©8, sir.

The complaint had t© ba

filed under our statute in order for th® clerk to issue a writ

43
of replevin.
Q

Together with an affidavit.?

MR. WRIGHTs Together — our statute no longer, rrs Mr»
Abbott pointed out, requires an affidavit, but in fact one was
filed with this complaint.

But our statute does require th®

filing of a complaint, that is, th® actual institution of s
lawsuit, before th© clerk is empowered to issue a writ of
replevin? and of course th© replevying party must file with th©
clerk e bond in twice th© vale© of the property sought to fca
repossessed.
On© question —
Q
bond?

What did Mr. Abbott mean by & on© or two percent

Under your practice.
MR. WEIGHT s

I think he has reference to th© fact h©

filed &n affidavit in th© court below to the effect that, I think
moat ©f the practice — or the practice of most bonding companies
in Florida require th© defendants who post forthcoming bonds to
actually collateralise the bond by putting up th© value of th©
bond itself as security, where they apparently do not require
full collateralisation of th© replevin bond itself.

That is a

matter of practice
Q

But the face amount ©£ the bond is the sam® in

both.cases?
MR. WRIGHTs

The face — yes, sir.

of th© bond is exactly th® same.

Th© facs ©mount

If there are abuses in the

44
bonding companySs procedures or charges, we of course would
submit that that would bo a matter for legislative correction
and not for a constitutional strikedown of this statute ©n the
basis of Fourth Amendment violation.
l would like to mention the fact that in our brief
before this Court, w© have dealt somewhat with the economic
aspects' of the secured sales transaction.

Our purposes in doing

s© is not because X purport to be an expert in th;

field of

economics, which is somewhat of a complicated field, but to
point out, I think significantly, that th© property interest
in the collateral sale, the collator©! which forms the subject
matter of th© installment sal©, is vitally different from those
involved in wage garnishments, which were involved in Sniadach,
and welfare termination payments which were involved in•th©
Goldberg v. Kelly cas®,
And secondly because the impact of altering or, in
fact, eliminating summary repossession remedies is- conceivably
so great that it should not b® done by a constitutional,
sweeping constitutional attack upon a long acquiesced-in and
honored remedy, such as replevin, certainly in absence of
compelling judicial precedent.
We submit that there is no compelling judicial
precedent of this court that would require a constitutional
strikedown of this statute on the basis of due process
contentions

45
The bimos when this Court has had befora it th©
question end the validity of the remedies of pr©judgment
attachments generally, such as in McKay vs, Kelnjsen..

This

Court has approved them, and only in Sniadach ha:? the Court
disapproved any projudgment attachment remedy or general
attachment remedy, anct that of course dealt with the qusstion
of garnishment.
The basis there being, of course, as Mr* Schwarts
has emphasised, 'that that involved, as the court stated, a
specialized type of property, wages, which the Court has
described there and in Goldberg, as the vary means by which to
live,
Both th© economic and legal aspects of tho secured
sales transaction, w# submit their consideration in considering
the due process contentions asserted her© by the appellant.
The respective property rights, of course, of the
secured seller and purchaser are vitally different from those
involved ia a pr©judgment garnishment.
For example, Family Finance has no contractual interest
©r legal interest in the wages of Mrs. Sniadach.

It has none,

certainly, until after judgment is entered upon the debt, if
there b© a judgment ever entered upon the debt.
Of course there is no contractual relationship
involved in the Goldberg situation.
But in the secured sales transaction, there is a

46

contractual relationship involved which gives the creditor»
we submit, certainly an equal if not greater property right
in the collateral as the debtor*

had it is for the protection

of the creditor and the debtor that replevin raiao&ies have
bean approved, have bean enacted, and have bean followed* and
have been acquiesced in for centuries of time,
Q

This remedy would b© equally avallabIo» I

suppose, if, let’s assume that the personal property cost a
thousand dollars, and after $999 had been paid and than there
was. default on the last dollar, the remedy would be equally
available to them, is that correct?
MR. WRIGHTs

The remedy, Mr. Justice Stewart, would

b® legally available under the Florida statuta, yes, sir.
Q

So you can't say that in every case there is

more property right in the plaintiff than in the defendant?
MR* WRIGHT £

No, sir.

You cannot say that in ©very

conceivable factual situation that that be the case.

We

have adduced in our brief and appendix to our brief statistics
reflecting, in so many instances, that for’

particularly

in automobiles, for example? that for the greater portion of
the ordinary automobile — the term of the automobile loan,
•that the value of the collateral itself is., or the resale value
of the collateral itself is much less than the balance owed on
the debt.
For example, if I can recall correctly, and it’s

47
reflected in our brief, that on a 36-month automobile loan,
that for the first 22 months the wholesale or resale value of
the automobile is less than the balance due on the 3S-month
loan debt.
Q

Well, there are two reason© for that;

on© is

tiie fast depreciation of an automobile in the first few months
of its life; and the other is that for the first faw months
the buyer is paying mostly interest and almost no principal.
Isn't that correct?
MR, WRIGHTs

That's correct, 2 would assume, if the

contract provides, of course, that interest is being applied —
Q
MR.

For the length of the payments.
weights

Payments ©re being applied first to

interest and then to principal, which I trust is probably the
case in most such transactions.
We submit further that the Snia&ach situation, or
Snladach ruling should not be extended to all types of tangible
personal property, and to the replevying of them, as counsel-for
appellant would here assert.

Indeed, I think that this Court

expressly recognised in Sniaflach that it was not intended to
extend its doctrine to all ©£ pr®judgment attachments in
general.
The Court stated there that a procedural rule that
may suit due process, or satisfy du© process for attachments
in general, citing its prior decision in McKay vs, McXnhe®, which

upheld on dua process claims the constitutionality of prejudgment attachment statutes of Main©,, does not nacosaarily
satisfy procedural dus process in ©very case.

And ©vary case

in Sni&dach involved, of course# th© specialised type of
property that th© Court recognised warranted th© specific
conclusion reached in that decision.
The same holds true in essence,, we submit, for the
Court's holding in tlm Goldberg decision.

Th© new property

concept there recognised as embracing those dependent upon the
sovereign for their very existence, that is the persons being
on welfare, and when they are deprived of their welfare
payments they arc© denied of their vary means by which to live,
w© submit, is peculiar to that situation and should not ho
extended to cover the situation of reple vy of all types- of
tangible personal property.
I think, perhaps counsel —
Q

What about Be 11 v. Burson?

MR. WRIGHT:
Q

Excuse me?

What about Bell v, Buraon?

MR. WRIGHT:

Bell y, Burson, if my memory serves m©

correctly, Mr. Justice Brennan, involves of course th© situation
©£ th© driver's license of the Georgia minister.

My under­

standing , or residing of th© Bali v. Burs on decision, was
essentially based on the entitlement concept that this Court
recognised in Goldberg, that one® the government undertakes to

49
give you something# evan though they aro not obliged to give
you southing, then that person has esquired such a property
right in that entitlement that he should have as. opportunity
to b© heard.

Of course in Ball v. Burson there was a provision

for a hearing# but not on the question of liability or fault.
But I think that Bell » Btva:;

more closely fits the

specialized situation in Goldberg# because the Court did observe
in Bell v. Burson# if my memory serves me correctly# that the
driver's license itself might well constitute the vary means
by which to live# virtually speaking# as are analogous to
the Goldberg v. Kelly situation.
Certainly we submit that cannot be applied categor­
ically to ©11 types of tangible personalty, &nd it should not
be implied to a tangible personalty at all,
I think there is one interesting statistic that we
have cited in our brief from a publication often cited by
tii© appellants themselves in their brief# entitled ”Th&. Poor
Pay More" •

tod it is. —; it demonstrates that people# while

they may not b© able to do without wages# can do without things.
The statistics show that insofar as consumer durable goods#,
including such things, as washing machines# furniture# carpeting#
sewing machines# that in families earning an annual income of
less than $3#000# almost 30 parcent — anywhere from 30 to 40
percent of those families# and this of course is a sampling#
it*s about a 300-family sampling? but it reflects that of the

so
families sampled# th© 300 familias sampled,- earning $3,000
annually ©r less, who had these particular items, th© v?ashing
machine, the TVs, th© sewing machines and so forth, that they
had paid cash for them.

They had waited until they could save

enough cash to pay cash for these articles,
And I think it demonstrates that whether we're talking
about rich or poor, that people can do without things, where
they cannot d© without wages or welfare bsnsfitso
I think it is important to mention, also that there?
is a vast distinction and a consideration to be given to the
contractual property right that is involved in this particular
decision, ©r in this particular case, which is not existent
in the decisions of this Court that counsel for appellant
relied upon,
I did want to mention, to clarify, in response to a
question asked Mr. Schwarts by Mr. Justice White, that Florida
j

does have the Uniform Commercial Cod®-, and under th© provisions
©£ Section 679.9-503, Florid® Statutes, it has th© self-help
repossession feature —
Q

Well, could Firestone have repossessed this

without going — getting a replevin bond?
MR. WRIGHT?

It could have repossessed this

peaceably —
Q

Under tea Florida statute and under the Uniform

Commercial Code?

51
MR. WRIGHT?

Yes, sir? it could btsva, so long ao it

did not invoke a breach of the peace.
But we submit certainly if that is reasonable &ncl
valid, and we submit, of course, that it is, that it should not
fo@ justification for striking down the replevin statute which
does provide for, of course, the intervention of the Stats to
assure a no-breach ©f the peace.
Thank you, sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER3 Thank yon.
You have two minutes left to you, Mr. Abbott.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF C. MICHAEL ABBOTT, ESQ«,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ABBOTTs

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it pleas© the

Courti
Briefly, with regard to the facts, the only point. I
want to make is that to the extent that the appellee Firestone
continues to say that the sheriff was invited into the horns*,
1 think is essentially misleading*

I would also like to note,

on® —
Q

Is that stipulated or isn’t it?

MR. ABBOTTr,
Q

No, it*s not stipulated. Your Honor.

It53 not covered by the stipulation?

MR. ABBOTT?

What happened was that Mrs. Fuentes

allowed the sheriff to enter after h© had mad® clear hta
position, that h© had an obligation to execute the writ.

I mean,

she didn't say, you know, “Coins on into my home.”
To say that he was actually invited, 1 think what
happened was that Mrs. Puentes acquiesced.

In fact Mr. :::non

acquiesced, in speaking for Mrs. Puentes vrho did not speak
English.
But on© thing I did want to note is that both the
lower court and our own brief made an error in indicating
that Mr®. Delgado called the. son-in-law to come to the house.
Firestone continues to contend that Mrs. Fusntes herself mad©
no protest.
I think that's not true.
Q

But, in fact —

Well, do these factual matters really make any

difference her© on the constitutional issue? '
MR. ABBOTT:

I don't think they do.

Firestone

contends -that Mrs. Puentes didn't make any objection.

The

only point I want to make i© that the record, at page 20, will
show that actually it was Mrs. Fuenfces who called Mr. Leon
and not her daughter-in-lav?, and that the lower court and
our own brief in quoting the lower court were in error on that
point.
The only point I want to emphasize is to say that,
as Mr. Wright did, they have more property rights than Mrs.
Puentes has, or she has more property rights than Firestone
has j,I think is to miss the point.
My whole point has been -that what Mrs. Fuentes was

paying for is the use of these goods.

And thrk is why she paid

the higher price than the cash aalo price*
In fact, we

cm

show in this case, I think, that

they didn't have any security interest in the stove at all,
whan they took it.

I don't think that's particularly important.

I think the situation would he exactly the seen® if eh© had made
only one payment at the time they cam© to take it, that they
have security interest in both items.

The point to be made is

that she is paying more for these so that she can hav© their

use

immediately.
Q

Well, if she continues t© pay more for them,

than she has their us@, doesn't she?
MR. ABBOTT s That is correct, Your Honor.
Q

But

This only arises when she stops paying.

MR. ABBOTT?,

That's right.

But of course tho Uniform

Commercial Cod© in Florida says there are situations in which
she has a right to suspend payment.

That is the crux of our

thrust, and it seems to me that Firestono ought to establish
»

that eh© has violated or is somewhat in default.

X mean, if

Florida gives her the right to suspend payments, is it then
fair to give Fireston® a right to take her property before they
prova that they're entitled to it?

That's'our thrust.

it seems to m@, to the extent that the appellees
rest

&a

the specialized property, that th^y ere ignoring either

the past history of the due process cases in this Court — this

Court doesn't always look first to the State interest involvedf
and then# if fcher© is a compelling State interest? they look
to see whether the property is significant.
Her® you hear very little talk coming from the
appellees on significance of fcha interest, and why they need
this procedure, why is it compelling that they have it?
What interest do they show that ‘they need it or that it is
required or that they are going to suffer without it?

They

just haven't shown that.
And that is the thrust of fcha past cases in this
Court.

You look first to the State interest.
0

Well, do you think this would be true ©vary time

that somebody wants to attack the case law or fcha statutory
law of contracts of a particular State, saying that it's
unconstitutional„ that all of a sudden fcha burden passae to the
State to show a compelling Stata interest?'
MR. ABBOTTs
Q

It seems to me —

For this particular rule of contract law?

MR. ABBOTTs

It seems to m if they're violating

th© fundamental rule of
Q

But that's the question before us, isn't it?

On that basis?
MR. ABBOTT;

That's right.

That's right.

/
you look at/the eases —
Q

Whether it's unconstitutional.

But if

55

MR. ABBOTT*

Mr. Justice Stewart, if you look at the

cases that are cited in Sniadach, all of those cases haw- a
compelling State interest except for two,

vs - Morgan and

Mclnnea vs, McKay, about which Mr. Wright speaks.
Now, those two cases, at least Ownbey clearly involves
a nonresident defendant, so that thsy needed that kind of
prejudgment attachment in order to bring hiss into court,
Mclanes vs» McKay, which was a per curiam decision, appears to
indicate that also there was & nonresident dofondant there, too,
to the extant the Court speaks ©f the dofondant making a special
appearance.
Those arc the only two cases cited by the Court in
Sniadach in which there is not a compelling State interest in,
terms of the statute at hand, in which © private creditor
initiated the procedure.

Those are the only two cases. And

both of those cates ©re distinguishable in that you needed that
statute in order to bring that defendant into court.

All the

rest of those cases involved compelling state interest.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*
MR. ABBOTT*

Your time 1© up now.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
