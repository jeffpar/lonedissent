ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD G. COLLISTER, JR., ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF Of THE APPELLANTS
MR.COLLISTERj

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

O

This :.s one of those cases that, in attempting to
characterize what yon3re doing to your colleagues back in the
office, you have a little bit of difficult’/ identifying
exactly what it is, because I hate to refer to it as the
Strange case.
What it is is a direct appeal from the three-judge
court sitting in the District of Kansas, which declared
unconstitutional and enjoined the future enforcement of a
statute passed by the 1969 Kansas Legislature.

The statute

involved, K.S.A. 1971 Supp. 22-4513, is a part of the Aid to
V

Indigent Befenfisaats Act, passed in that year by that Legislature,
I think what happened to generate the passage of the
entire Act was that the confusion that existed with regard to
the manner and method of not only determination of indigency
for the purposes.? of appointing counsel in criminal cases, nut
also the .method of payment of counsel in some fashion- caused
'

■ Zj-y.i'LXlatr-xi- to pass a rather comprehensive Act.

the Kstoolishffiont of a board of supervisors

to govern the a. ■iduiatractive rork of the Bystem» which is
0.0. ainioterst: di actIf by the State’s ■jtic ioiai administrator»
Mr., James,
The boar d of supervisors is authorised to cause to be
accumulated a pane 1 of attorneys in the various districts» and
to formulate rules and regulations for the implementation of th
Act»
Once the panel of attorneys is formulated, any
district judge or magistrate may rely on any attorney on that
ounsel to those who he finds indigent
and requiring counsel.
The challenged portion of fcha Act provides that whan
•mv expense has been advanced or paid by the State on behalf
of somebody who has been found to be indigent, the State is
allowed an opportunity to causa repayment, at least to be
attempted,

The procedure that is used in 4513, the repayment

statute, is'that the judicial administrator causes a notice
co be rent to the person upon whose behalf the expenditure was

made.
0

May I ask, what would the expense embrace?

Ml. COLliXSTEP;

The expense can embrace any amount

of money expended under the Act for the provision of counsel —
Q

Mr?-, COLI,ISTER;

Is it set by the Act?

MR. COLLIStEL?

They are awarded fees.

Currently

what — well, 2 shouldn’t say currently, because this has been
tree tlirough the history of the Act.

Each year the judicial

administrator, on behalf of the Supreme Court, proposes e.
budget no live State Legislaturef which appropriates tas money
to fund the indigent programs.

His estimate is roally a

Lt was to start with.

In any event, the money

is appropriated, fcher the board of supervisors, which includes
the judicial administrator and a justice of the State Supreme
Court, determine* rates of compensation.

Currently the rates

art figured at about $15 to $20 an hour? $15 an hoar for outof-court time, and $20 an hour for in-court time, with a
ina. iraeut of $500 in any ease not involving a sentence of life
imprisonment or death.
In other words, for all practical purposes. everythin*,
but a capital case.
Also the statute authorizes the expenditure of funds
to provide defense services, let's say, an investigator, x
would assume the transcripts would be included although I have,

Q

these are direct outlays now, —

MR. COLLISTEP:

Ye S.

MB. COLLISTEB:

I'm not sure that I quite under­

7

MR. CCLLXSTER:

No» sir*

There is a statutory

authorization rc:c a Stata Public Defender system, but, to my
knowledge, that has not been implemented by the Stats. There
are two Public Defender offices, but they are funded through a
federal grant, through federal Safe Streets Act money.
Q

Right.

Xe this — under the statute this is

collectible equally, where the defendant is acquitted or
convicted, is it?
MR. COLLISTER: The statute appears to read that way,
yen, sir.

There is no State decision interpreting any aspect

of the statute handed down by the State Supreme Court; whether
they would read some exceptions to those defendants who were
acquitted into the Act» I do not know.
The statute applies equally across the beard.
Q

I’m familiar with the system of at least one

State, at least the way it used to be, where if the defendant
w-.k

acquitted that was the end of it and the State absorbed

the cost.

But if he was convicted, he was supposed to pay off

the cost over the period of his time.
MR, COLLISTERs

Our research disclosed, 1 think,

sword Cl.tciere that was the case.
1
made upon,

r suppose an' equal protection attack could be
that kind of a system.

8
MR. COLLISTSRt

1 would expect it.

1 think, regardless of what the statute in its

d. -.v 11

■ :,o. r

:

three-judge court, the State would he prohibited from taking
any kind of action to allow reimbursement or recoupment,
because what the; three-judge court decided — and if I may
refer to the — the court’s opinion is printed in the Juris­
dictional Statement, in the appendix to the Jurisdictional
Statement, and I would like to refer to pages 7 and 8 of the
appendix, where the three-judge court, on page A7, says:
“Hence any construction of the Kansas statute which
leaves intact tie State’s right to recover legal expenses from
indigents is a construction which inevitably impinges upon and
d.starmines

[si.ci undermines] the rights protected in Gideon.”
And the same reasoning is employed on the next page,

ie-udiug us to conclude that whatever form the State might have
,

;t*i or mxght choose to enact in the future would, under

that philosophy, be an unconstitutional burden on the right to
counsel.
This «.ction was filed in the Federal Court on
.• a,... If of a plaintiff, David Strange, who had been charged with
a felony criuts in the district court, ultimately in the
District Court ■: £ Shawnee County. Kansas? Topeka, Kansas.
He ro; eived the letter of demand from the judicial

edmiHiutrr&tc•••:•: notifying him of the State's claim as a result

9
Cv: a dir

rutlay of $510 to his court-appointed attorney,

Mr v ?JiI.kis':son .
At that time the Federal Court action was filed and

ever sinet then the State in that case has agreed to not
proceed any £>'.

rsr? and when the district court handed down

it i decisio;--, a permanent injunction restraining any enforcement
of that provision of the statute was also ordered.
Q

how, X gather, in this case, the only expense

v/a:.: the $£Q0 paid the attorney?
HSR. CCLLISTER:
Q

That's my understanding, yes.

Yes.

MR. COLLIS.TSR;

The issue, as we see it, is one

that's a little bit — for me to verbalise, the issue stated
in the brief is as follows:

Whether the existence of a State

■statutory procedure, providing for the collection from an
iiKligcii.t defendent of moneys expanded by the State to furnish
hit.! counsel', constitutes an unlawful burden upon an indigent
defendant's ti^ti Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.
Now,.that's pretty wordy.

But it's difficult to

approach the subject without having to do a little bit of
defining of what we're talking about.
The State has attempted to treat all those who are
foTsid to be .indigent equally, with regard to this particular
statute.
• a

The State has attempted to treat them the same as would

vi 1 -juc

.a.-.f debtor foe treated in the State courts, with

10

one. possible- exceptioni and that relates to the exemption.
7:v ■';t: - lev & civil judgment debtor in the State are
litlie b;<

3.

'e:/:;.': than the jo under the hid to Indigent

De iandants- Act,

end the statute specifically defines what

exemptions are■ «•.v&il.sble and what are not.

Primarily the

exemption is the homestead exemption.
The statute is uijoh broader, however, than simply
allowing the State to take a judgment against the person found
to he indigent, because it authorizes, in effect, the setting

aside of a fraudulent -conveyance: and the establishment of a
lien against any property that might have been transferred by
tb.3 indigent prior — or, excuse me, subsequent to the time

the crime was committed.
In trying to define what the precise issue that the
Xo;-,er court treated, the three-judge court, we have to look to
tho Sixth Amendment, which provides that in all criminal
prosecutions tho accitsed shall enjoy the right to have the
assistance of counsel,

And the precise question we ask is:

What does it ms an when it says "the right to the assistance of
counsel**?
counsel?

Dees it mean that the State has to provide free
because that’s adding a word that’s not in the

Constitution«

Anil iu the decisions of this Court, relating to the
this Court

in terms of protecting

she Sixth l: ondiaent right to counsel by providing counsel, or

11
seeing that the defendant at a criminal trial has the oppor­
tunity to be heard by counsel, does that mean that the State
has to been; the expense of providing that counsel under all
cl rcuras t an ce s ?
It is the State's position that at the time the
criminal defendant is tried in the State of Kansas under the
Aid to Indigent Defendants Act, the constitutional right to
counsel is protected*
Q

It's protected to this extent:

that if I ever

get money any time in my life you're going to take $500 stray
from me*

MR. CCKLISTSR;

It is protected in that manner with

the same limitations that exist with regard to any other civil
judgment, as to time period, yes, sir.
Q

We*re not talking about civil cases, we’re

talking about criminal cases.
MR. COLLISTER:
Q

1 understand that. The same —

And Kansas, I assume, is in the business of

rahabi.litating prisoners?
MR. CQLLISTER:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And so after the man has served his time and

comes out, and he says, “Wall, I think I'll get a job.55

And

then he remembersz "no use me getting a job because I’m going
to have to give that money to the State."

than the s-s:cc- commission of the crime anc, as in this case,

qualify as mi indigent and did have some financial consequences: »
That he did have to remember, because he

Q
that.

He's paid that? his services, he‘s paid for

But this is —

MR. COLLISTER:

If he has, yes, sir.

But in this case he's told that "We'11 give

yon counsel, but if you ever get your hands on a buck, we’re
going to make you pay for it."
MR, CCLLi'STER: Well, the statute provides that that
will occur if -~

If he gets a buck.

MR. CCLLISTERs
Q

Within a five-year period.

X mean

If he gets a buck.

MR. CCLLISTER: Within five years.

And the State

can collect it.

Q

The State will collect it.

Q

Mr. Collister, let’s take an extreme case.

in; pose he inherits a million dollars next week?

You would

13
expect him to pay that 500?
MR, COLLXSTEB:
Q

Yes, sir,

Or suppose# another hypothetical case, that at

the time of his arrest or his trial, it developed that he had
$500 in the ban! saved up.

He wouldn't get the free service

then, would he, necessarily?
MR. t’OLIilSTER: Well, that's a

in practice, X think

taut’s a lot mere difficult to answer than it would appear.
My impression would fee that he would not if he could afford to
use that money lor the services of an attorney.

Of course he

would claixi that he couldn’t use that money for the services
of an attorney? or that he wasn't sure that that much money
would be enough, because the attorney who represented him on a
asis might say, "I'll charge you on an hourly basis.*5
Practically, whether or not that would in fact occur,
I think may bs debatable; but as a matter of abstraction, I
would think that that would be the case.
Q

,:ind if he hires a lawyer for $250, and he

inherits a million dollars, that lawyer can't get another 250
from him, can he?
MR. CCLLISTERt

Ho, sir.

I’m assuming

that they have

a set agreement that ha is to receive only 250, not something
dependent upon hia acquiring money.
Q
pleas?

Do you think this — does this help in guilty

MR. COLLISTER i

I don’t — I don't have any

statistics that would lead to a conclusion one way or another.
My guess is not, because I do know that we're trying a lot
more cases than ws have in the past, generally.

Q

Iho sets the fee?

Certainly the defendant has

no say in the amount of the fee, does he?
MR. CCI.LISTERs The Claim is made by the attorney to
— which has to be approved by the judge who presided over the
case, did the appointing in the appointing hearing? the claim
is then submitted to the judicial administrator to present to
the panel that supervises the entire operation of the .Ret.
Assuming that the rate that is then in existence is
followed, that's approved.
Q

What 1 had in mind was

1 don't know that your

brother on the other side makes this argument, or that the
court did the decided this ease? but normally in a •— when a
defendant is not. an indigent, at least there is or might be
so we negotiation with his own selected lawyer as to the amount
of the fee.

And while he may not be in a very good bargaining

position, at least ha may negotiate a fee.

And here the fee,

the amount of the fee, is entirely beyond his control.

He's

not consulted about it at all; and presumably, again to take a
hypothetical case, Kansas might decide to pay lawyers $10,000
for this job,
And I know in the Act you say it's limited to 500,

IS
except in non-capital cases, but — or they might decide

to

pay $500 for ten minutes* time.

MR. CGLLISTERs
Q

There are —

.i nd then just automatic ally charge the defendant

that amount, that he would not have had anything to say in.
MR. CCLLISTSRr

There are conceivable situations

which might he subject to a different kind of attack than the
present statute, where an unreasonable amount was charged.
Q

There's no claim that this amount is unreasonable,

I gather, in this case, or that the general fee schedule is —
or fee system is unreasonable?
MR. COLLISTERs

1 don't believe so.

And, furthermore,

the basis of the throe-judge court's decision was that any
attempt, regardless of whether it was five percent of what the
regular minimum fee schedule would be, would be an unconstitu­
tional burden on the exercise of the right to counsel.
Q

Of course, 1 suppose present counsel isn’t in

a very good position to challenge that reasonableness of the
fee.
[Laughter.]
0

Mr. CoIXister,cbes the existence of this recoupment

statute in Kansas tend to reduce in any way the type of inquiry
or the extent of inquiry initially made by the trial court,
when the defendant claims to be indigent does the trial court
feel freer to conclude that ha is indigent without any searching

16
examination because of the existence of the recoupment statute?
Mt. COLLiSiAu; fell, again, I don't have ~■ that's not
a — ny answer can't be documented? but my assessment of what
is occurring would bo that because of other reasons our judges
are getting much mors careful about examining parsons who allege
they are indigent for the purposes of appointing an attorney,
And the primary reason is that the increase in the number of
representations by attorneys in court-appointed cases has
increased so much in the last three to four years that our
courts arc becoming very --- are much more seriously inquiring
as to the indigency status than they ever did before»
And that approach is implamented even more by the
statute, which,the current statute which, in another — current
Act, excuse mo, which, in another provisions, specifically
authorises the trial judge, if he wishes in his discretion, to
require the indigent applicant to file an affidavit setting
out certain information concerning his finances.
So my guess is that there is more inquiry going on
right now.
Q

But not because of the recoupment statute?

MR. COLLISTER;
Q

Correct.

Mr, Collister, you mentioned the fraudulent

conveyance provision in the statute.

Has there been any

experience in Kansas, to your knowledge, that suggests the
.wegis* afcura wax motivated, in the enactment of this statute,

17
by conveyances being made to enable individuals to take
advantage of free legal counsel?
MR. COLLISTER:

Not to ray knowledge,

I have been

in the Attorney General's office for four years, and I have not
heard of anything that has caused the Legislature to become
-- to react in that fashion.

1 suspect that what has happened

in our State, as has happened in so many other places in the
last three to five years, is that every year we get into a
continual fight in the Legislature about who is going to get
what money is available, and how we're going to get that money,
And, as a matter of fact, it was reflected in this
very same Act, in 1971, when the Legislature almost refused to
expend any money to the judicial — to appropriate any money
to the judicial administrator to administer under the Act.
I suspect that what they were"concerned about was
trying to recover as much money as they could, and there has
been some recovery, and I recognize that that recovery is not
very much compared to the total expended. ;
Q

$17,000 in two years, as I recall.

MR. CCLLISTER: The period of time that the recoupment
provision has be an in affect was from approximately July 1 of
1969 through the first part of 1971, when the three-judge
court declared the statute unconstitutional.

There * s been

no attempted col lection since then.
So it *» about one year and eight or nine months.

don't know

lx-':

affective the provision would be to
>ney because we haven't had thj

mush experience, to foe quite honest about it.
Q

I’m not sure I followed your figures.

What was

the amount recouped in that period of time?
MR.
Q

ccLLXSii-Rs

Approximately $17,000.

Shout a thousand dollars a month?

MR. CCLLISTER; Roughly.
Whether or not the work that had to foe done by the
judicial administrator, the Attorney General’s office, and the
county attorneys in the State justifies that kind of recovery
may be debatable, but that’s the province of the Legislature,
to decide what

its to implement as long

of

coarse, doesn't violate the Constitution.
Our feeling about the subject matter of the district
court’s opinion is that the right to counsel, the opportunity
to be heard by counsel is granted and implemented by the Act.
Wafvs- reviewed decisions of various courts. We find very few
in point on this, particular issue.
The California Supreme Court has held that you
can’t, as a ?cnc.ition of probation, require reimbursement of
moneys expended, making much the same argument that is made in
this case.
The :c o:- Supreme Court, in dicta, indicated that if
it;, itais Leyielature would adopt a statute — I’m assuming

19

that it would bo similar in substance to ours

that the State

could recover moneyThe Ohio Court of Appeals has allowed a similar
procedure in Ohio.
But other then that — the Supreme Court of New
hanpshire has rendered an advisory opinion that, the way 1
raid it at least, indicates that under their State Constitution,
which is different than the Constitution of the State of Kansas,
the State ha-3 to provide free counsel; because or the wording
of the Hew Hampshire Constitution.
That is about the sura total of the precedents that
we * re able to pieaentf that either side is able to present, for
that matter.
The issues, as seen by the three-judge court, were,
'it, whether or not the right to counsel encompasses an absolute
requirement that the State provide free counsel as opposed to
allowing the opportunity be heard by counsel? and, secondly,
whether or not the statute imposes an unconstitutional burden
on th : exercise of a constitutional right.
Directing my attention to the latter of those,
whether or not the burden is needless or un re a s on ab 1«,; i n part
those hove to be, in this kind of a case I think, determinatione
of the Legislature:

whether this kind of a policy is justified

with the obvioun time and trouble that S tate officials have to
go through

20
0

v; sat oorrsant do you have on the reasoning of the

district ucvpt tlvvfc. the statuta deters indigents from exercising
their right to the assistance of counsel?

Because it puts

the accused is U.s ■ position of deciding whether he can afford
to consult even with court-appointed counsel.

Because the

accused has not the means to hire an attorney in the first
instancef he will not La in a position to accept court-appointed
counsel when it merely means that he has, at most, ninety days*
grace in paying the cost of the legal services rendered on
his behalf.
What's the ninety days?
MR. CCLUSTER: The ninety days is after the notice
is sent.
Q

Well, when is the notice sent?

MR. CCLLISTER:

MR. COLLISTER: That's also true.

My thought about

the quesfci.cn that Mr. Justice Brennan asked wag:

if that, in

fact, is true, then our entire system of appointing — excuse

mu, then cur cant ire system of requiring representation of
counsel it. criminal cases is unconstitutional for all cases,
except these whe , unlike myself, are wealthy enough to afford
any lawyer that they want to afford.
Q

Eufc, generally, if he pleads guilty, he doesn't

have to wrry abcut it?
MR. COLLlSkEEs

If he pleads guilty, ha —

Q

Ha has the right to counsel there also.

Q

If he waives his right to counsel, and signs

an affidavit waiving it, and pleads guilty, you can't collect
a nickel from him? right?
MR. CQLLISTER:
sir.

if nothing has been expended, yes,

We can't —

So that's one way of saving 500 backs.

MR. CO '.LISTERs

Yes, it would be.

The judgment is a lien against —

The

It is a lien against all property

that a civil judgment would operate against.

The homestead

The lien exists for five years, unless

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN E. WILKINSON, ES{>. ,
ON BEHALF OF THF APPELLEE
MR, WILKINSON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the

Court;
I suppose that I am the one who failed to tell David
Strangs that I wasn't free court-appointed counsel, and
consequently 1 have felt morally obligated to carry his cause
pretty much at iry expense.
When I first confronted David Strange in the jail,
I was under the impression that I was free court-appointed
counsel.

And had the statute bean called — had I known about

the statute at that time, the state became effective July 1,
I think I was called on July the 10th, 1969, some nine days
later,

fen days later, I perhaps would have done essentially

the Bane thing 1 did after I pled David Strange guilty under
ox B.rco law, which I believe Justice Brennan cited in Fay va.
Noia.

28
:eropted to stop the crlmii al proceeding
at that time- because, contrary to what Mr, Chief Justice
Burger has said., he thought he could take judicial notice of?
X think it's important for a young Run to be advised, and
particularly in this young man's circumstances where he's
guilty, committed -his first offense, to be given a chance again *
fad that's what he's been grappling with in his own situation.
He’s from a far'dly. of eleven children.
He hat. a brother who was in the hospital for the
criminally insaus, who set a bad example for him when he ran
away from the State hospital, and got him Into trouble in this
case.
After 1 pled him guilty to this offense, David
Strange got a job, and he's working today.

He's had a

marginal existence.

Mr

30

statuta .tu y :.vc: State vf Kansas, what was the system? Did
lawyers appoint* .3 to defend indigent criminal defendants serve
without p gy, ur - era they paid by the State with no recoupment?
MR. WILKINSON:

No, they were paid for by the county,

as an expense of the county.
Q

By the county.

bin. WDLSXNfOKs

The Board of County Commissions

allowed — set aside a sum of money for counsel for the
indigent defendants.
Q

sit.d then without any recoupment?

MR» WXLKINSON:
Q

Without any recoupment.

2md this was the first Statewide State law or;

this subject, I believe?
MR. WILKINSONs

Yes, sir, it was a reaction to Gideon

vs. Wainwright.
Q

Before that, was there disparity, were there

variance;:: with the way the various counties handled it?

MR. WILKINSON:

Well, I would think so.

1 would

think there would be some instances where, if a man was on
probation, that a judge might say, "You pay back a certain sum
of money to your attorney.”
But you see this particular statute; starts out
prior to the time you really learn the circumstances of the
indigent aceused.

The accused stands charged,

■whother he*s going to get

You don’t know

probation, whether he wants to

31
contest any of the actions of the police, whether or not. he
x&rJ-ly wants to have a jury trial , whether or not he wants to
confront his witnesses, whether or not he wants to crossexamine the -State's witnesses,,

This has all been ahead of

time .
And, as you pointed out earlier., he has no opportunity
to determine what the amount of his judgment might be unless
someone advises him in advance, which didn't happen.
Q

But there are controls over the amount, as

explained to us by your brother here?
MR. WILKINSON:

Yes.

Yes, sir, and in answer to one

circumstance, I do know that there was a substantial judgment
against an accused after trial in Shawnee County.

He decided

he would go ahead and contest the charges against him, and he
was ultimately acquitted, and then he was saddled with the
judgment.
Q

Ho was saddled with the judgment?

MR. WILKINSONs With the judgment.
Q

But after — what — a matter of $300, unless

it was a —
MR. WILKINSON: I think —

„
MR. WILKINSON;

He says a maximum of $500, but therq

is an allowance in special circumstances, depending on what
the judge will allow and what the Board of Supervisors will

32
allow.
Q

"all, th,; County Boars is still in the picture?

ME. WILKINSON; No? the county is not; it’s a State
Board.
Q

State Board of Supervisors?

MR. WILKINSON;

Yes,, sir.

And 1 did not contest that,

but the judicial administrator and one Supreme Court justice
and — who's the other one?
Q

There are three of there.

But it's a State agency.

ME. WILKINSON: They sort of act together, primarily
through the advice of the judicial administrator.
Q

After this statute went into effect, Mr.

Wilkinson, if you know, could you tell me whether the number of
appointments want up or went down, as compared with the graph,
if you were graphing it, prior to the Act?
MR. WILKINSONs
the same.

I would say that it stayed essentially

The need for counsel in a serious offense, as set

down by Gideon vs. Walnwriqhfc, was recognized by the courts,
and that, ^as much as anything, determined that there should be
counsel appointed; but not the statute.

It didn't have

anything to do with the statute, I don't believe.
Q

Mr. Wilkinson, does Kansas, the State bar of

Kansas have a recommended minimum fee schedule?
ME.-. WILKINSON;
Q

r.ow

Yes, sir.

did the limits on the fees recoverable under

33
t for representing indigents compare with the similar
seessccceided Zone in the Kansas irate bar ■ s ' schedule?
Kit vsllSIbiOb;

X resit say vent it's less than half

!cr what X work for.
There is quite a bit of movement among the lawyers
in the Legislature to do some thine; about that, end X would
suspect that over the course, of time, as they pay out more
money for fees for contract architects and consulting
engineers» and things of that nature, that we attorneys will
finally get paid a reasonable fee also.
Gideon 73, t Kaimrright, X c*on9t want to lose sight of
that, because 1 feel like the finding of the three-judge
district court was correct, that if the statute was not to date
the accused from exercising basic rights, that it53 needless*
it’s not necessary for our democracy to work. We must have a
point of emphasis here.
A real finding that, for the poor who are in a. free
society, we must prdvide free counsel.

1 don't believe that8a

asking too much of our society.
Q

You’re now addressing yourself to the policy

question, are yc-u not?
MR. WILKINSON %

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

t think you'd probably find universal agreement
c.n that as a matter of policy, that it?s certainly desirable.
Eir,: foes vhc.x reach the constitutional issue that is involved

in this ce.se, of the recoupment?
MR* WiLKXNSON:
separate the two.

Well„ I don’t think that you can

I believe recoupment to be a, in this

particular .instsnce, to be somewhat the deterrent of the
exorcise of basic, fundamental rights♦
I want to adhere to that policy.

X feel that the

recoupment provision is a means of control, supposedly, of
holding down an accused, an indigent accused, in exercising
basic rights.
Q

I firmly believe that.
Mr, Wilkinson, help ms out on another aspect

of deterrence. Suppose that your client here, Mr. Strange, were?
not an indigent but he was just above the Indigency level,
and he had a fairly large family to support.

Do you think the

fact of incurring legal fees to defend him in a legal case
might deter him from pleading not guilty and,, rather, push
him into pleading guilty to get it over with?
MR. WILKINSON:
Q

Yes, sir, X do.

I think that. —

low do you square his situation with that of

Mr. — the actual Mr. —
MR, WILKINSON: The actual Mr. Strange?
Q

Right.

MR. bllblNlOHs

Well, as far as squaring the person

who ha;-: is:come just above the poverty line, X think probably
the best way that that is provided for in the statute is through
■'h

judge’s intsrrogation as to finding out what this man has

35

in the way of a family? what his needs are,

And then, after

the jilts- has nets t) is judicial determination of indigency,
then he’s afforded free counsel,
judge,

1 think it's with*

I don't think I'm begging your question,
Q

Maybe we just come out to the point where there

are some inequities built into any system, somewhere,
MR, WILKINSON?

I think so.

I think that the best

way is'give them free counsel, then they will —
Q

The best way is to give the true indigent free

counsel and let the just-barely-over-the-indigency-line sink
or swim?
MR. WILKINSON: Well, I know that Judge Templar, my
ex-boss, in a similar case in criminal court gave free counsel
to a man who was: making right at $13,000 a year? making a
determination that he had ten children, that it was more
important for him to have the counsel in this case, free
counsel in a federal district court case.
In the normal circumstance, you wouldn’t determine
that this man,•making that kind of money, would be povertystricken,

But still in need of counsel? indigent in the legal

sense, I suppose.

And that’s up to the judge to determine.

After that determination has been made, I feel like
it’s in society's best interest to make it free, to make these
rights viable.
Q

to you know of any statutory definition of

36
xndigencyi
ME. Ilii Eliis 0Y;

‘Adix :‘:Iu'hio'.-,al defenders' A;:nocintion

— and I have tc- apologise to the Court, I didn't know enough
about amicus curiae procedures to gat this in ahead of time
they have analysed all these statutes that talk about poverty
levels,

laid if you don't have it, X have one copy of it, if

you'd like it.
Q

You may leave it with the Clerk.

MR. WILKINSONS
Q

Yes.

You may hand it to the Clerk later on; you can

do that afterwards, end he will prepare copies for us.
Q

Mr. Wilkinson,

MR. WILKINSON:
Q

Yes, sir.

— you state in your brief that this statute

has had a chilling effect on the use by indigents of counsel.
Is there anything in the record to support that?
ME. WILKINSON:
Q

Yes.

In this particular case?

'

MR. WILKINSON:

Ho.

Because, you see, I didn't

advise him that he was going to have to pay me back.
0

Well-, what is the basis for the statement in

your brief to that effect?
MR. WILKINSONs

In my brief, it's in the district

court*s finding.;- that's what they found in their decision,
Mr, Ju3tioe Powe11

-

37
Q

They moi-e a finding without anything in the

record to support it?
HR. WILKINSON: then }" filed — I would say, to some

extent, that's true.

When I filed this case, X thought it was

going to be a simple little matter, because X had not given
this person notice that a judgment was about to be rendered
against him, and neither did the magistrate judge, and neither
did the district judge.

X thought I was going to be proceeding-

on the basis of due process notice.
ted it was admitted in the Stipulation of Pacts that
there is no notice given to the indigent accused.

I did no-:

contemplate than the court would keep this matter under advise
ment over a year, and make a decision later on on the basis of
some chilling effect.
Q

but nothing in the record on this subject?

MR. WXLXIKSONs

There's nothing in the record that

he ever had notice, either; and X don't want to loss* David
Strange's case.

X did not cross-appeal, but I don't think

that it's necessary to cross-appeal in a situation where the
judgment may have been based on some wrong reasons.
ted X bring this up in my motion to dismiss, after
the jurisdictional statement was filed, that, sure, we go along
with the chilling effect, and X can understand that from my
own experience.

But that's not in this record.

to this indigent accused is in this record.

But no notice

38
record does not show the number of Indigents

Q

who have been provided counsel in the last two years since
the statute became effective?
MR. WILKINSONS

No, the record does not show.'

I

believe I have some statistics on that, that X can give to the
Clerk.
Q

Fro® Kansas?

MR. WILKINSONS

From Kansas.

1 was going to put them in, but I thought that
$17,000 would not — it doesn't look like even a good deal
for the taxpayers.
Q

And Kansas may well decide-.,

in a short time,

that if isn't worth a candle and give up the whole idea? is
that possible?
MR. WILKINSON8 Well, they may decide, particularly
if this decision stands, they —
Q

No, I'm talking about —

Q

They have no choica, thert.

Q

They have no options.

independent of any judicial action.

I’m talking shout
If they collect an

average of a thousand dollars a month, it certainly must cost
them something to collect it, administratively; but after a
while, if they are let alone, Kansas could conclude that this
was an ini

■ .sting- experiment and abandon the whole idea.
MR. WILKINSONs

Except that the Attorney General

39
would pror ably testify:
ivi court: .

he

get

Well, tills helps keep down problems
ore guilty pleas,- and we can keep better

control over them*
Q

But there's no evidence in this record that

that's happened, is there?
MR. WILKINSON:
Q

Mr. Wilkinson, I have great problem with this

no notice business.

You knew about it.

MR, WILKINSON:
:>

No, sir.

I knew about the statute, you mean?

You{re presumed to have known about it.

'4P,., WILKINSON:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, there's an

exemption —
Q

Isn't that a problem for you?

MR, WILKINSON:

It is a great problem for me, because

I was presumed to know the law, and did not — and he was — the
indigent accused was presumed to know the law; the magistrate
judge was presumed to know the law? the district judge was
presumed to know the law.

And this indigent accused didn't

gat. any notice at all, other than constructive notice.
Q

But I should assume that the magistrate and other

people would assume that the lawyer would fall him what the law
was.
MR. WILKINSON:

1 think that would — you could

assume that, if that were the actual case.

I think the due

process notice, however, talks about actual notice and not

40
abstractive not ice; not assumptive notice.

the indigent accused —

Yes, he was,

Well, you, the assigned counsel asked district

judge to eater an order not requiring the defendant, to pay

MR, WILKINSON:

That's right.

MR. WILKINSON:

After the fees had already been

didn't have any authority.

MB. WILKINSON:

Yes, sir.

he did —

On Decorat er 9. 3.959, they sent a notice to him?

I■■Hi* WILKINSON: Right•

Q

He had notice -'•••

Bo, he had notice before there wee any judgment

entered?
MRo WILKINSON: That!s correct.
Q

What is your due process contention?

What

other notice should he have had, do you say?
MR. WILKINSON!

at the time, he was to be afforded,

or provided court-appointed counsel.
Q

Well, that’s simply a question of knowing the.

substantive basis on which a judgment might ultimately be
entered, isn’t it?
ME
Q

Ns But he didn’t know that.
Weil, but have any of our cases ever held that

specific notice of a substantive; provision of a particular law
mu::: - be given to an individual before he can be made subject to
it?
MR. WILKINSON:

I think Walker vs. City of. Hutchinson

— a due process and eminent domain case — does not actually —

Q

Bint that was a lien foreclosure.

There was an

action against a particular piece of property, wasn’t it, in
Walker?
MR. WILKINSON:

Yes, sir.

New, Z think you're talking about essentially, not

42
property as such, but you’re talking about a parson's ability
to make his way in society,
3

Mr, Wilkinson, I suppose in this lawsuit you're

on your own?
MR. WILKINSON:
Q

Yes, sir,

I notice in your motion to dismiss the appeal

filed here, you did indicate to us that the primary issue
before the three-judge court, as you saw it, was whether or not
David Strange had been given notice at the time counsel was
appointed for him that he would be charged with paying that
counsel, in the event he ever had any money? and that was a
matter that the three-judge district court eventually just
simply disregarded.
MR, WILKINSON:
0

Yes, sir.

So 1 suppose if we should — in the event that

this Court decided that the district court was wrong on the
constitutions! issue it did decide, we should remand it to the
three-judge court to decide the questions that you really
thought were -.the primary questions in the case?
MR. WILKINSON:

I think that that would be the case.

Your Honor, because it was brought up before them,

I don't

think it's necessary, in view of the admission by the State
that there wasn't any notice and that I had argued that X don't
think it was necessary for me to cross-appeal.
Q

Right.

So there wasn't any deterrent in this

43
case» at .least, that's clear?
MR. WILKINSON;

Well» he had no notice.

We don't

Know whether there was deterrence -Q

Well, if ha did have notice he wasn't deterred?

and if he didn't, have notice he wasn’t deterred.
MR* WILKINSON?

I have to admit that there wasn't

any deterrence in this case, and I —
Q

So yon must go — so the three-judge court

decided a case that wasn’t before it?
MR. WILKINSON:
Q

Well, they

I tried to —

2nd isn’t the case you presented to them, anyway?

MR. WILKINSONi

That's right.

That’s right.

There

was another case, there were other cases —
Q

You were saying that he didn’t know anything

about what the law was, and that he shouldn't be saddled with a
debt that he didn’t know he was getting into?
MR.. WILKINSON:
Q

That’s right.

Well, I suppose you can, in arguing to the three-

judge district court, though, make an argument that your client,
has been saddled with this $500 judgment and it’s invalid,
the law imposing it, because it would have a deterrent effect
on other people.
MR. WILKINSON:
Q

Yes, sir.

Even though it may not have had on your

particular client.

Yes.

Yes.

MR, WILKINSON:
Q

Yes. And I think justifiably.

You mean it’s overbroad?

MR. WILKINSONs Well, 1 think they considered it
sort of a class action:

the accused and others similarly

situated.
Then they took into consideration if they had another
case that was

They were more or less rendering a judgment at

MR. WILKINSON:

That’s right,
i

1 wanted to make just one statement about fraudulent
conveyance, if you want to get talking about —
Q

Was there any such problem in this case?

MR. WILKINSONs

No, sir.

It would seem to me that

■ t would be unnecessary for the State to have such a statute.
if someone maker, a fraudulent conveyance under these circumstmces, the State would have fraud practiced upon it, and

45
could exercise its common-law remedy.
This is another thing, Mr. Justice White, as to why
they want into 3113(b), which dealt with fraudulent conveyance
But they declared the whole statute unconstitutional.

X was

really dealing with 3113(a).
I did include in my petition, included them both
in my petition, that the facts of the case only relate to
3113(a), recodified as 4513(a).
Regardless ox what you find the situation to be with
the three-judge district court in making an overbroad decision
I want to reiterate that, their decision — that the decision
of Gideon vs,, or inwright is sound, that this statute tends to
impede and. impinge and infringe upon that decision.

When

you take into consideration that we were bringing it for —as the district court did, when we were bringing it for the
indigent accused, this particular indigent accused and others
similarly situated, that this three-judge district court was
justified in firding on the basis of Gideon vs. Walnwright tha
he must have free counsel in order to provide him with a
basic, fundamental right to counsel.

A necessary fundamental

right to counsel.
It's not, in my estimation, a right that needs any
subtleties attached to it., as this statute does.
I urge the Court to uphold the decision of the
three-judge district court and to reiterate again that in this

society we need to provide free counsel to the indigent accused»
I thank you very much.
MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGES;

Thank you, Mr. Collister.
