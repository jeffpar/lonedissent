MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 5046r Apodaea against Oregon.
Mr. Sobolf you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP RICHARD B. SOBOL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS '
MR. SOBOL:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
In 1963 this Court decided Duncan v. Louisiana, in
which it. held, for the first time, that the Sixth Amendment
right to trial by jury is applicable to criminal trials in
State co-arts by virtue of the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
A month later, in Da Stefano v. Woods, the Court
held that the holding in Duncan would only be applied to cases
tried after the date of the decision in Duncan.
After Duncan, the three petitioners in these eases
were

tried in circuit courts of Oregon for serious crimes, and

each of them was. convicted by a split verdict under the
procedure authorized by the Oregon Constitution, of allowing a
criminal verdict with 1.0 out of 12 jurors concurring.
The votes in the respective cases were llrto-l in two
cf them, and XQ-to-2 in the third.
The jury in each of these three cases was out or the
jury room, for less than an hour? in one case

4
for less than a half an hour.

The convictions were appealed to

the Oregon Court of Appeals * raising the argument that the
Sixth Amendment rights enunciated by Duncan had been violated
by the acceptance of a split jury verdict, and the Court of
Appeals of Oregon, following a very recent decision of the
Supreme Court of Oregon, affirmed the convictions and held that
the Sixth Amendment doss not guarantee the right to a unanimous
jury verdict.
The Supreme Court of Oregon refused review of the
cases, and the cases are here on certiorari to this Court.
The question, therefore, which is presented, in light,
of Duncan and De Stefano v. Woods, is whether the Sixth
Amendment permits a conviction for a serious crime without a
unanimous jury verdict.
.'■inti I would like to, in light of the arguments made
by the State of Oregon, refine that question even further, and .
that iss

Where there is no State procedure for minimum periods

of deliberation, which is the case here, whether the Sixth
Amendment permits a conviction of a serious crime without a
unanimous jury verdict,
Q

In your view, would a minimum period for

deliberation make a difference, Mr. Sobol?
MR. SOBOLj

My personal view on

I think it would be a different case.
it was that it would still not be satis­

factory, but the reference in.

the State's brief to the English

5
system and tine proposal of the American Bar Association are
systems and proposals which,-, as part of them, secure a minimum
period of deliberation.

The draftsman in both those cases

recognize what we think is a very important value lost by the
Oregon system, of requiring jury deliberation; and I think when
and if that case ever gets here, the Court will have a
different question if another provision is made to insure
deliberation, whether or hot that insurance is satisfactory.
Now, in 1970,' in Williams yy Florida, the Court passed
on the question of the six-man juries in Florida, and the Court
held that although there had been a six-man jury historically
at common law, and although the Court in the past has indicated
that the Sixth Amendment does in fact require — I'm sorry,
that there had been a 12-man jury at common law; and although
the Court, this Court had indicated in the past that 12 jurors
are required under the Sixth Amendment, in reconsidering the
question, the Court made a two-step analysis:
First, it said the history of the Constitution, the
history of the Sixth Amendment left the question open, that it
was impossible to tell from the historical material what the
draftsmen of the Sixth Amendment meant on this point.
Mr. Justice White, for the Court, said;

And

The way we're going

tc d termina which feature of jury trial right at common law
i.s x .'o:

raxea in the Sixth Amendment is to determine whether

the feature in question serves an important purpose in terms of

6
the functioning of the jury system.

It’s a practical test to

be applied.
Applying that test, the Court held 12 men are not
required, and specifically left open the question as to whether
a unanimous jury verdict is required.
Now, we are arguing this case squarely within the
holding and the test enunciated in Williams, and we think the
application of this test resolves the case in our favor,
because the requirement of a unanimous jury verdict serves
four very important purposes in terms of the basic function of
the jury process.
Those four purposes are:

it insures that the jury

enters info meaningful deliberation? we think it serves an
important purpose in maintaining the reasonable-doubt standard
in criminal trials? we think it maintains an important purpose
in giving meaning and effect to this Court's decisions
requiring that a cross-section of the community participate in
jury decisions? and we think it servos an important function
Vi

•

in terms of community respect and confidence in the process of
the criminal lav; and in the convictions that are secured in
criminal cases.
And I'd like to discuss each of these four functions, t
indicate their breadth.
Q
Ktn:;r;f for

Mr. Sobol, as you do so, those are good arguc

roliry matter will you emphasize the constitutional

7
aspects of them as you go along?
MR. SOBOL?
hi::1s senses

Yes, sir.

They're constitutional in

interpreting the Sixth Amendment in Williams v.

Florida, this Court said that the way to resolve the issue of
constitutional interpretation in the Sixth Amendment, what does
"jury* mean?

ft means something.

And the Court said;

in terar

of deciding what it means, we’re going to look to the functional
importance of the requisite of the jury trial in issue here.
That was the Sixth Amendment test enunciated by Mr.
Justice White for the Court.
We are simply taking that test and arguing in this
case that unlike any fixed number of jurors, the requirement of
unanimity is a concept which serves very important functions,
and therefore meets the constitutional test enunciated by the
Court in Williams.
How, in IfSG, in Allen v. United States, this Court
said;

"The very object of the jury system is to Secure

unanimity by a comparison of views and by arguments among
jurors themselves.a
The unanimity requirement is the aspect of the jury
trial system which insures that the jurors will go into the
jury room and exchange views.

The work that has been dona in

the jury area by Kalven 6 Seise1 indicates that in States such
as Oregon and Louisiana, the two States that have split
verdicts, —

8

Q

Now, was Allen a Federal case or a State ease?

MR. SOBOLs
Q

Mien was a Federal case, Your Honor.

Well, was not the Court addressing itself to the

jury system as then established by Act of Congress?
MR. SOBOL:

I think in Allen the Court was talking

about the jury system constitutionally.

It was a case having

to do with a charge to the jury, Your Honor,

It. did not raise

I am just indicating that in Allen the Court was
referring to the operation of the system in what was important
functionally.
Q

The Court was certainly aware then, as we all

are now, that when the Sixth Amendment was proposed it was
proposed to have the unanimous verdict, was it not?
MR. SOBOL:

There was an amendment in the House to

include unanimity as a specific requirement of the Sixth
Amendment.

That amendment was unsuccessful.
In analysing that exact amendment in Williams, the

Court said that it is not possible to determine whether the
unanimity requirement, along with the other aspects of that
amendment, was stricken because everybody knew that jury trial
meant unanimity, or because the Congress did not want it in.
And in approaching this case, Your Honor, we have
simply accepted the very recent interpretation of that very
legislative history in Williams, and accepted that conclusion,
that it’s sir of one, hal£-dcss$st of the other, it's impossible

to determine from that legislative history what .exactly the
framers had in mind.
I would point out that the major controversy concerning
that amendment did not have to do, in any respect, with the
requirement of unanimity.

The main argument about the amendment

was a proposal to put vicinage in the Sixth Amendment, to regular
that a specific district, as at common lav?, be incorporated in
the Constitution.

The debate was about that point, as the

Journals of the Constitution reflect, and so on, in our brief.
And the amendment was deleted with respect to that issue; the
whole amendment was deleted.

But that the controversy that

the Congress was focusing on was the vicinage requirement,
which was not desired to be included.
And with that, the entire subsection was deleted.
.analysing that, as I say, in Williams, the Court said,
you really can’t tell what the Congress meant in its drafting;
and that, again, the question has to be decided in terms of
whether the issue, the requisite is functional in terms of the
jury system.
How, the unanimity requirement means that the jury
can’t come out of the jury room until everybody agrees, and
because everybody has to agree, the process means that everyone
cits down at a table and hears the views of all the jurors.
And this is important, because the idea of having more than
one juror is that different jurors are going to see the

10

questions differently, are going to have different perceptions
of the evidence.
And the reason that a jury verdict is as fine a thing
as it is is that everybody's view of the evidence, everybody's
interpretation has been merged, has been hammered out. has
been considered by everybody? sc that when the jury comes out
of the jury room and announces its verdict, you have a collectiva
judgment, which is considering the views of everybody.
Now, in
Q

Well, as Justice Blackraun suggested, isn't that

the policy argument that led, it was either four or six of the
States of the Original Thirteen to insist upon a unanimous
verdict provision written into the Constitution?

Now, isn't

that — aren't you arguing the policy desirability?
MR. SOBOL:

No, sir.

I'm saying that when, in this

country, you talk about juries, its intrinsic meaning means
unanimity;■ that the jury system does not function, as we know
it, without unanimity,

And Mr. Justice White, in Williams,

said that is the question the Court must ask when it is up for
considerations

whether a particular feature is included in

the Sixth Amendment.
m

sirvgly taking up that test and saying that

without tli i’'o: :
th:i: osmnv ry.
of the syr-

you don't have a jury as we know it in

Tin- . the, as the Court said, the very object
is tc secure unanimity by a comparison of views

11
and by arguments among jurors.
Now, in —
Q

Mr. Sobol, —

MR. SOBOL2
q

Yes, sir.

would your argument apply equally well to a

civil jury as to a criminal jury?

If not, why?

MR. SOBOL: Well, I think — no, it wouldn't apply,
1 think that there are, as the courts recognised innumerably, a
case like In re Winship comes to mind.

There are certain

interests at stake in a criminal trial, by which the society
has historically wanted to be very careful about erroneous
convictions, The risk of error in terms of a criminal conviction
has historically been thought in this country to be a much mor*
serious matter than the risk of error in a civil case.
Thnt innv.ra.erable procedures have been established in
criminal cases to lessen the risk of error in fact-finding,
which is always present,
Now, I think the absence of unanimity certainly
increases the risk of error, and the risk of an erroneous
conviction.

And X think that the considerations, the stakes

in civil cases are very different in a very important respect.
o

Would you say that if there were a requirement

in the statute of Louisiana, that they must deliberate six
hours or eight hours before they can return a less-thanunanimous verdict, that that would satisfy you?

12

MR. SOBOL•

Well, Your Honor, personally '1 think that

there should be r.o time Halt, there should be no procedure
whereby the majority can simply sit out the minority.

But I

do very firmly want to indicate to the Court that 1 think that's
a very different case, and I don't think Oregon can defend
its procedure in this Court by saying, well, in England there
is a minimum period of deliberation.

h minimum period of deliberation is undoubtedly a
step toward retaining this feature of the jury system.

In

States like Oregon, when the jury goes into the jury room, it
takes its first vote, if the vote is 10~to-2, there is no
discussion., they return to the jury box and announce that
verdict.

If the vote is 8-fco-4 and after an hour it turns to

lO-to-2, there is no further consideration of the minority
viewpoint.
Now, in these cases, the juries were all out a
matter of minutes, and I think that whatever may be the ultimate
decision, whore a State adopts a minimum period of deliberation
system, as they have in England, and as the American Bar
Association has recoamendeci, it certainly has no relevance in
defending the constitutionality of this system.
Q

Mr. Sobol, help me out a little bit.

provided for 24-man juries instead of 12,
the•same argument?
ICE. SOBOLs

Yes.

If Oregon

would you be making

13
Q
this:

Well, then, what your argument amounts to is

If you had a 10-to-2 vote of the jury, you would like to

have it hang at that point, if there were no ultimate
persuasion; then you would be content with a new trial„

And

then if a second trial came along, on precisely the same
evidence, -** now, I realize that3s a big assumption — and the
jury convicted? actually your vote would be 22-to~2„ And yet
you would be content with this result?
MR. SOBOL; Well, there would have been a 12-man jury
which would have considered the evidence, which would have
deliberated, which would have reached a verdict, then I think
the first jury would not be relevant is my view.

If there was

a 24-man jury together, and 22 voted, yes., I guess I'd make
the same argument.

I think that there is an important value

of the jury system in hearing what the different viewpoints
are. That's why you have more than one juror, because people
see things differently? that8s one of the basic human lessons,
that you want to hear what everybody has to say.

That’s what

a jury system is, and I think if you were to exclude that in
the process in the jury room, I would make the same argument
regardless of the number.
Q

Well, then, I guess what I’m suggesting, and it

may be an invalid assumption, is that a lot depends on the
11 luck of the draw", the jury composition.
SOdoi,; Certainly.

Certainly.

14
A lot depends on the "luck of the draw”; but ones it.9 s;
dreev, the system is to hear what everybody has to say before r
vote is rendered, at the very least; and I say, more than that,
to work it out so that you do have a unanimous collective
judgment.
How, ray second contention with respect to ah.at the
function of unanimity is has to do with reasonable doubt»
As the Court knows, in Winsh.jp, it indicated that the reasonable; •
doubt standard is constitutionally required.
How, reasonable doubt was developed in the context of
a unanimous jury verdict.

What it means is that the prosecutor

has to convince every juror to convict this man, and specifically
what that means is that the juror with the highest standard,
the most doubting juror, must be convinced.
I think it's beyond argument that when you say the
prosecutor needs to only convince less than all the jurors,
that a leaser burden of proof is being put on the State; the
convictions on less evidence, conviction without convincing
all the people are being allowed, more evidence would have
secured all the jurors8 vote, but with less evidence, ten or
nine, as in Louisiana, is being allowed.
The most difficult jurors to convince need not be
convinced, and therefore X think it's plain that the standard
cf proof in criminal trials is being lessened by a rule which
allows a majority verdict.

15
Kow, just very briefly on the figures the Kalven 6
Zeisel study have revealed.

Across the country, 5.6 of the

juries hang? 5„6 percent of the juries hang.

In Oregon, 3.1

percent of the juries hang.
What that means is approximately 2«5 percent of all
the criminal trials, you get a verdict in Oregon where you
wouldn't get a verdict elsewhere.

And we think those are the

hardest cases, obviously, the eases that would have otherwise
hung, the oases that have the greatest doubt associated with
them? and it*3 those oases in which Oregon is permitting
criminal convictions where other States do not.
Now, the Kalven & Zeisel —
Q
it, and ask?

Well, you must go on, to get a fair picture of
How"many of those are convicted on retrial?

MR. SOBOL:

Yes.

Which I don't know.

But some

are and some aren't.
Q

But Kalven & Zeisel have those figures too,

don't they?
MR. SOBOL:
no.

I don't believe that's true, four Honor,

If they do, I've missed them.

in there? convictions on retrial.

I don’t believe they’re
Perhaps I'm mistaken,

But what Kalven a Zeisel does say’and has determined
from their empirical data is that when a jury is hung lO-fco-2,
■ ,* II-1 at 'iha

-si ox ths process cf deliberation, that

-tlssca gaosiar a is a •at at. fl.o out-set, that whore the first

IS
vote is ll-tc-l or lO-fco-2, the jury will not hang.

But it

is where, that there is 3-to-4 or 9~to-3, the process of
deliberation succeeds only in wheedling down that number to
2 or 1 that the jury will hang.
And their conclusion is that those are the very cases
in which there is substantial doubt, where the jury cannot
resolve the doubt,

And those are the cases where the

historical judgment is that the jury should hang.
Now, perhaps on retrial there would be different
evidence, more evidence, less evidence, that might result
in a judgment one way or the other.

But at the trial which is

being held there is doubt which cannot be resolved, and those
are the cases which historically have resulted in hung juries,
with the option of the State to retry.
Q

Mr. Sobol, one thing that you suggest, would

lend itself to persuading the State and Federal Government to
have 18 jurors or 2*1 jurors, because your incidence of the
skeptical juror would increase, would it not?
MF., SOBOL:
historic

The incidence would increase, but the

but the Court is interpreting the Constitution,

and there1s a deviation from the historic standing, which
has always Ivan recognised by this Court, which is proposed
here.

I am simply arguing for the maintenance of that

cic-rhard, net for something new.

At the last argument Your

Honor ask 1 whether we simply decide these cases on how you

17
make convictions most difficult.
And I am saying obviously that is not the test.

But

where you have a system, and the system here is unanimity, and
the reasonable-doubt standard is developed within the context
of that system, end then a State comes along and says. Well,
we8re going to have lesser proof? then 1 think it is the
occasion for the Court to say that that deviation is not
allowed, because that is a significantly lesser protection for
the defendant than what the historic system has bean.
In Williams, the Court said 12 or 6 is not going to
make any difference, in terms of the defendant's chances of
winning or losing that case.
Here we think it's plain that when 10 are voting one
way arsd 2 the other, and the two cannot be convinced, you are
making a difference, you are lessening what you need for a
conviction, and that is a deviation from the reasonable-doubt
standard.
Q

Mr. Sobol, one detail that slipped my minds

If you have a vote of lQ-to-2 for acquittal, under the Oregon
system, is that an acquittal or is it a hung jury?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

It's an acquittal?

MR. SOBOL:

Q

It's an acquittal.

An acquittal, yes.

Then you wouldn't object to that?

MR. SOBOL: Would I object to the acquittal, if I

18
represented the defendant?

No, 1 wouldn’t object to it, but

I don’t think it has much to do with the issue before the
Court, in which the hill of Rights concerns protection against
conviction„

What yon have to do before you can convict a man

in a court in this country«
I don't think, you can balance off lesser protections
again:.: t conviction by a rule which allows a certain number of
additional acquittals.
I should also say that the indications are, and they
may or may not be* accurate, but the study indicated, by Kalven
& Eeisel, indicate that 80 percent of those extra verdicts in
Oregon are convictions.
How, my third point as to the functioning, and X must
be very brief on this; the third point as to the function of
the unanimity requirement has to do with the cross-section
cases in this Court.

The Court has held that a cross-section

of viewpoints must be represented on the jury.
Now, I'm not going to argue this in terms of race or
any particular minority, but it’s perfectly clear from scores
of cases in this Court that an important function of the
jury system is to get a cross-section, to get a spectrum of
views, because —

Q

Xn ary large city today, have’ you ever heard of

a err- s-sectional jury?
a cross-section.

What you mean is the panel must be

19
Mil. SOBOL; The panel must be a cross-section, and —■
Q

Not the individual jury?

MR. SOBOL?

No, but when the jury is finally chosen,

we have done what we can to insure a mix of views.
Q

It3 s not —

To get a cross-section in New York, you'd have

to have about 40 jurors, would you agree?
MR. SOBOL;

Yes, sir; I would.

But I think you’d

come as close as you can within the concept of 12, or whatever
ths number is.
Q

But there is a —
Well, on your point about persuading them, it's

the prosecutor’s job; he wouldn’t work as hard with a six-man
jury as he would with a. twelve; is that your argument?
MR. SOBOL?

Well, the Court said, in. Williams, that

that is not true. The Court said that there is no significant
difference.

And I don't really argue that; I don’t have that

question before me.
Q

Well, Mr. Sobol, but this game argument you’re .

making now about the cross-section, it would have been equally
available in arguing for a constitutional requirement of 12
rather than 6.
MR, SOBOL %

No, X don’t think thas’s true,

I think

what Mr. Justice Whit® said in Williams is that — 12 is not 40
anyway, you’re not going to get a perfect cross-section either
way, and 6 as to 12 is not going to make that substantial
difference in the or os e-section.

That’s different from saying

20
this man's on the jury, we’ve done our best to get a crosssection, it8s not scientifically accurate but we’ve done our
best; there he is, he hears the case, but his views are not
going to be considered in the jury room because the first vote
that’s taken shews him to be in the minority which is acc-eptabl
and that the jury returns without hearing his views and without
incorporating his views.
Now, it’s .a difference in degree, but I certainly
think there’s a difference;

where you've got the man on the

jury, after being selected, and he’s excluded by virtue of the
procsss.

Q

And you say that doesn't work if it's a 10-to-il

vote for acquittal, because the protection is against improper
convictions?

The same theory doesn't work?

ME. SOBOL;

I think that in both cases you're

excluding a viewpoint.
to make convictions
against it.

But if the State wants to do something
acquittals easier, I’m not here to argue

I don't think that raises a constitutional issue.

But certainly, either way you're excluding a viewpoint.
But when the viewpoint is being excluded and a
conviction is resulting, I think it raises questions under the
Sixth Amendment.
How, the last point on the functions of the jury
ayetern her; to dc with the public respect, and confidence in
criminal jury verdicts.

21
In Winshlp, the Court,, referring to the reasonabledoubt standard, said. It is indispensable to command the
respect and confidence of the community in the applications to
the criminal lav?.

It is critical that the moral force of

the criminal law not be diluted by a standard of proof that
leaves people in doubt whether innocent men are being condemned
It is also important in our free society that every individual
going about his affairs have confidence that his government
cannot adjudge him guilty of a criminal offense without
convincing a proper fact-finder of his guilt with utmost
certainty.
in
Now, in Oregon,/25 percent of the criminal trials
we have a divided verdict.

Now, I think that that's a serious

matter in terms of public confidence in the certainty of a
criminal verdict, that there is something historically about
everybody going out and everybody coming back and saying
"guilty", which resolves doubts at large about what’s going
on in court.

When you've got a quarter of the cases where

the jury is not in agreement, I think that's a serious matter
in terms of public confidence in the —
Q

Wall, are you suggesting that there is a lack

of public confidence in Oregon, in the —
MR. SOBOLj Well, I've never been to Oregon, Your
Honor.

Q

— criminal process?

22
MR., SOBOL:

I don't know.

But I think that if you

have division in the jury, which has not been resolved in a
quarter of your cases, that's a serious matter in terms of the
historic operation of the criminal system in this country.
Q

So you think there is doubt here on the Potomac,

but maybe not in Oregon?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

There's doubt in my mind about —

Yes.

MR. SOBOL:

— about that many split verdicts.

Particularly where it's so unnecessary.

Because While they're

having 25 percent divided verdicts, if the jury was allowed to
finish its process of deliberation, the nationwide figure
indicates that the huge majority of those cases would reach a
judgment.

Bo it's not like we're saying that a verdict

couldn't otherwise be reached in those cases; in 80 percent
of those cases it could be reached.

Only 5 percent of the

total would result in a hung jury.

So it's a process which

serves so little purpose in terms of convenience, and has such
a heavy price in terms of the appearance of what’s going on
in court.
Q

What percentage of criminal cases

what

percentage of juries hang in Oregon now?
MR. SOBOL:

3.1, where the national average is 5.6.

So you achieve a slight lessening in hung juries.

And those

are the very cases in which I maintain that there is —

23
Q

So there is only a difference of, say, 2 percent.

we"re really talking about 2 percent of the cases»
f.K, SOBOL: $e're talking about judgments being
reached in 2 percent additional cases, which is a lot of people,
Your Honor.
Q

Less those that might be convicted on retrial.

MR. SOBOL;

It's 2.5 percent less those convicted

on retrial, yes, sir.
Q

Less those that might be convicted on retrial*

MR. SOBOL:

Yes, but, of course, one thing you don’t

know is whether the process of deliberation might have
resulted in the verdict going the other way, whether some
middle ground might have been reached.
Q

Right.

MR. SOBOLs

We don’t know how the jury operated,

so -Q

You don't know which way the jury hung.

MR. SOBOL: We don't know which way it hung, and we
don't know the manner in which it would have achieved unanimity,
what else might have happened in the jury room in terms of
leaser offenses, in terms of dividing counts, we don't know any
of that.
Mil we know is that the process of deliberation has
been short-eivaulted in the middle, and that a verdict is being

in most of

24
at2.5 percent of the caseo.
Q

Well, of the 25 pereant of the cases, how many

ware divided for acquittal?
MS, SOBOL: Well, from Kalven & Zeisel, which is the
only information I have, Mr. Justice Blackmun, they indicate
that 80 percent of those divisions are for conviction, in
20 percent the division is for acquittal.
Q

So it‘s really you're talking about SO percent

of the 25 percent now?
MR. SOBOL:

I’m talking about 80 percent of the 25

percent, yes..
But iay main point is —
Q

Well, this Kalven study is pretty scanty, isn't

it?
MR. SOBOL:

Q

It’s the best study there is, in terms

It's the. only one?
SOBOL;

Yes, the only one there is? that’s right.

21 cw, just lastly I'd like to talk about the
;ignificanoe of the holding in this case.
Forty-eight States require unanimity in cases
covered, by the Sir.th Amendment under Baldwin? only two do not.
hor.-f. in Duncan, the Court said:

"Although virtually

■.... :.:-vh,: ..uu aebareaca to the reasonable doubt, standard in common
•w a

• :,c .

: . .

not conclusively establish it as a

2S
requirement of due process-, such requirement does ‘reflect a
profound judgmant about the way in which the law should be
enforced and justice administered'.“
Here the Court is faced with a situation in which
48 States have resolved this question one way.

The burdens of

a changeover here are very slight, they don’t require
empaneling more juries or anything else, it’s just simply a
different instruction to the jury.
In closing. I'd like to make one last point which
keeps occurring to me, and that is that Oregon did not fas an
for this —' did — let me put it this way:

Oregon did not

determine to interpret the Sixth Amendment this way.

When

Oregon adopted this statute, the constitutional rule out of
this Court was that there is no State jury trial requirement.
And I dare say that no State has affirmatively
undertaken to interpret the Sixth Amendment requirement to
alt -" a majority verdict.
Q

What —

ME. SOBOLs

Oregon has backed into this question, by

virtue of&jjhe Duncan decision.
Q

What is its constitutional provision for a jury

trial?
MR. SOBOLs
Q

In Oregon?

Yes.

:0c. SOBOL3

Well, it *3 vary interesting, it has

26
exactly the language of the Sixth amendment, and than it
says:

Provided, however; that in — and I’m emoting off the

top of my head — in circuit courts ten out of twelve jurors
may enter a judgment.

Q

Well, that must have been its judgment that

although vs8re going to provide for jury trials, the jury tr±a‘*
doesn't necessarily involve unanimity.
'KB. SOBOL:

Well, it seems to me, its judgment, that

it included the Sixth amendment language and then expressly
took away from the Sixth Amendment for Oregon, and it was
entitled to do that under the state of the law.

The more

narrow it is, is that the Sixth Amendment applies in Oregon.
Q

Would you say that Oregon provides for a jury

trial in its constitution?
MR. SOBOL:
Q

No, I don't.

I would say it does not.

Even though it says so?

MR. SOBOL:

It doesn't say so.

It says something and

it takes it away.
Q

X know, but it says we want a jury trial.

MR. SOBOLi

Provided, however, it won't be a jury

trial, because ton out of twelve are going to be allowed to
convict. And I think that's not a jury.

Q

Well, I suppose you must take that position.

MR. COBOL:

0

Yes i

Yes,, I /vast.

MR. S030L: Thank you very much.
O

This was an amendment, was it, of the Oregon

Constitution?
MR, SOBOL:

It was an amendment in 1934 to the Oregon

Co ns titution.
Q

In 1934?

MR. SOBOL:

In 1934.

And my point is, for what it's 'worth, is that at the
time that decision was made, it was not made in light of the
Sixth Amendment requirements, because there were none.
Q
Q

Right.
it was made in light of Oregon’s jury trial

requirement, though?
MR. SOBOL:

Yes, the Oregon judgment under it.

Yes.

the Courts
That amendment was passed by a vote of the people of
C • vg

in 13-34, and it

vj&a

in response to a recommendation of

the -cerican Law Institute made in 1931, in its proposed

28
criminal code at that time.

So that is its history * it was

a e.--.by a Crime Commission, including a young law
professor named Wayne Morse, who achieved some prominence, and
•also cf one who reached the Subversive Activities Control
Board.

That's a matter of incidental information.
is s preliminary observation, I want to point out,

with also a tip of the hat to Kalven & Zeisel, that I am not
here necessarily defending seme darling of the prosecutor's
nursery; X an; here to defend majority-verdict system as good
system, rather than to argue for advantage.
Because what it does is it facilitates the end object
of trials, that is a verdict one way or the other.

There's

no particular statistical advantage to the prosecution, and,
in fact, a slight statistical advantage to the defense.
Q

.Is it your view that you have to sustain the

burden of proving that it's a good system, or is it your burden
merely to prove that the Federal Constitution doesn't put any
restrictions on the States?
wR. TAviSSR:

It is my burden, Your Honor, to show

that it5a not violative of the Constitution, and particularly
of the Sixth Amendment.

1 don't think it will hurt me to

demonstrate that ifebs also a good system.

seek to broaden it, to some interpretation of the phrase "Jury

Is this including retrial evidence?

MR. ‘ZMi'thR:

No, I *m not speaking of retrials»

We

do generally retry cases in Oregon, but I can't speak to
retrials.
ourtheroore, X point out, just since we’re talking
statistics, that we convict some 85 percent of the defendants
in Multnomah County that go to trial? 94 percent altogether.
So when we speak about an 80/20 break of hung juries for

guilt or acquittal, even there the defendant would enjoy a
slight advantage in Multnomah County, by which I mean Portland,

tched tc

f

item? and the American Bar Association

30

project on minimum standards agree with that as a suitable
form of procedure for the United States, in its report of
1968»
And even Kalven & Zeisel, whose commentary is not
always on our side of things, begrudgingly admitted in their
Lav? Review article, in their speech advising the English, that
justice in Oregon has not broken down, to quote them; but then,
also, nobody has ever claimed that Oregon justice is superior
to justice elsewhere.
Kalven & Seisel so state.

The Constitution does not

require that our justice be superior to elsewhere, or. course.
We find that it does sort the guilty from the not
guilty, and it does it in a fair manner; it does so accurately?
and it does so efficiently.

And I think that all three of

those qualities are essential.
To invalidate the Oregon system, of course, this
Court must find that it is offensive either to the very wording
of the S:Vcth Amendment or it is offensive in the sense which
counsel suggests, that the phrase "jury trial” precludes a
majority-verdict system, and we argue that neither is correct.
It is not violative of the Sixth Amendment.

I wish

to point out that I — and counsel pointed out an error to ms
in my brief; and I wish to acknowledge it. with my regrets.
I started discussing Article III, section 2, and the
constitutional debates thereon, quoting from Elliott, and I

31
transposed the word in my notes, '‘’civil” to "criminal” in my
brief at page 19, which I regret,
At the Constitutional Convention they were arguing
about civil cases only.
When the Congress met to submit the Sixth Amendment ,
horever, as counsel acknowledged, there there was specific
reference to criminal cases, specific reference to unanimous
jury verdicts? and James Madison’s original formulation, which
I will read, reads;
"The trial of all crimes , . . shall be by an
impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage, with the
requisite of unanimity for conviction, of the right of
challenge, and other accustomed requisites
That was passed in that form by the House, sent to
the Senate, and there in the Senate various of the clauses,
including the unanimity clause, were stricken.

The diarist

of the Senate was ill that day and. so we do, not have a record
of the delate.

It was sent back to the House.

There was a

motion i.n the House to restore most of that wording.

The

motion in the House failed on an even vote.
So unanimity was stricken from the Sixth Amendment.
hnd this Court, in order to decide with the petitioner, would
essentially have to reinsert the language which the Congress
struck.
.a... to whether or not, under Williams vs* Florida and

32
Duncan vs,. Louijilanat. the phrase "jury trial" in and of itself

sound.

Because it is functionally

The function of jury as used in that phrase., and defix i

in Duncan and Williams, .was that — or is that it is to serve
as an interposition, an interpositional safeguard, an inter­
position of the common sense of the citizens as a shield
against an oppressive government.
Thera is a safeguard inserted between citizen and
Crown,

It stemmed from the distrust of the courts which

existed at that period.

It stemmed, also, I might add, from a

considerable distrust of lawyers, and also of prosecutors.
But originally the Crown was the agent of the — or the courts,
as the agent of the Grown, were thought to be oppressive; and
that was inserted.
Unanimity is not necessary to perform the function
of safeguard.
Surely, for example, if there were a jury of 24, and
we allowed a verdict of 23 out of 24, that sort of a system
would safeguard the citizen from an oppressive government, it
’would interposition citizens' judgment at least equally
effectively as the now requirement that six citizens sit in
judgment of the facts.
The function, according to those cases, and I’m sure
correctly so, is the substitution of citizen judgment for
:r;:t X x "h..'.’.;--. ?:vl. had a verdict of 10-to-2 does just that.

5: might point out that for other high crimes and

treason, tin.- Constitution allows the fact-finder to decide by
three-quarters, and I apeak specifically of the impeachment
procedure, wherein, at that time, an lfi-to-26 vote was
sufficient to find the President or a judge guilty of, as X
recall the phrase, high crimes or treason on impeachment.
Q

Well, then, Mr. Tanzer, you'd make the same

argument if the Oregon system were 7-to-5?
MR. TANZER;

No, Your Honor, I would net.

There must

bo a certain adequacy to the safeguard, it seems to me.
I am not called upon to defend 7-t©~5.

And

It must be more than a

mere majority, it would seem? but I say that as a subjective
judgment.
And 10-to-2, I would remind you, is a 5-to-l vote?
that the ratio is 5-to-l.

But 7-to-5 is barely a 1-fco-l ratio,,

it's only slightly more than that.

9-to-3 is quite another

matter.
Somewhere there is, I think, simply a judgmental
determination to be made.

And I think that lO-to-2, at least

in my experience, has worked out satisfactorily

in Oregon,

without public clamor to the contrary, and it is in agreement
with, as I indicated, the American Law Institute, the American
Ear is :oc:. : ,fcico project, and the English.

In 1830 there was a

of a Royal Commission in England that they switch

to a 9-tO‘b or 3~to~4 system, but it went nowhere.

Jeremy

34
Benthc-.m was its severest critic.
Q

Mr. Tanser, in Oregon, if the jury goes out,

they always take a first vote, all juries do usually, and is
this a right that if the first vote, is 10-to-2, that it stands
up?
MR. TM12XSR:
Q

That could be.

That could be.

Well, is it?

MR. TMTEER;

It depends on how the jury chooses to

operate, Your Honor.
There is a tendency among jurors to desire to be
unanimous^ but that’s something I can’t prove or anything of
that •—* I can’t cite studies.
Q

Wellf if the jury goes out and takes the original

vote, the vote is 10-to-2, what happens to that word
”deliberation”?
MR. TAMSKRs They are empowered, Your Honor, to return
their verdict at that time.
Q

Similarly, —

They are empowered to return a verdict without

deliberation?
MR. TMiBm: They are empowered equally to where they
had voted 12/0, to return without deliberation.
Q

Without deliberation.

But 10~to-2, if two

people think the State hadn’t proved anything, and I assume
thej can’t even say that.

And I must say —

Alid that's authorised?

MR. TAN3SR:

It would be authorised, yes, indeed.

Because in that ease, one side or the other, the State or the
defendant, has persuaded ten men beyond reasonable doubt.
Q

Well, why have twelve?

Why not have a ten-man jury?
MR. TAKZER:

Well, of course, that would be

You know, I'm not trying to debate the alterna-

fcives, Your Honor, but to discuss what we have.

Well, that's under Williams, isn’t it?

MR. TANBERs

Under Williams, of course, six would be

sufficient*
1 might add, incidentally, that we have used six-man
juries in our lower courts, and they are required to be
unanimous.
Q

Wall, is there any movement to make that majority,

too?
MR. TAMSER:
Q

No, there is not, Your Honor,

Why do you add it?

MR. TAN2SBR:

There is not, avid I think wisely not,

because ummimity is nor® desirable as the number is reduced.
Because we are talking about a safeguard function.

If the

juries wore cc-^posed of 40 man, then obviously unanimity would

Lad six unanimous will perform if;

We tend to be contentious.

Ini’. X will answer those arguments.
The burden of proof is not affected. The standard
of proof beyond reasonable doubt is not affected by a nonunanimous jury system*

Thu burden of proof stays with the

government except for affirmative defenses.

The burden of

persuasion, stays with the government, except for all
affirmative defenses.
Beyond reasonable doubt remains the standard for
whomever it is that the law, authorizes to find the facts, ax,
that is not a coordinate of numbers.

That may be 12 jurors.

6 jurors, or one judge? or 10 out of 12 jurors.
The doubt of one juror is not reasonable doubt ?
•alsewise a hung jury would be a finding of reasonable doubt,
and there would be — operate as an acquittal, and this Court
authorised retrial .in such situations back in 1902.
And to carry his argument ad absurdum to demonstrate
that the beyond reasonable doubt argument is not applicable,
we could say, by extending his argument, that a rule allowing
a seven-man verdict for a preponderance of the evidence, a
nine--Kan. verdict for clear and. convincing evidence, and a
'::.;plve~m::Si oordint for beyond reasonable doubt, would be the

There are, however, less than constitutional solution

That seems to me a rather interesting device, and
probably a very good one.
1 might add, incidentally, that there is a directive
of courts as is the practice in England, wherein the trial
courta are directed not to instruct the juries, even, regarding
the possibility of a majority verdict, until they have
deliberated for two hours and have reported back.

OH BB.AALA OF THE PBl’I^XOMBRS

■4ESOBOL:

I S'- like to make a few very brief erccc-.

Firstly, 1 think perhaps the Court has been struck,
as 1 ■. rs, A -.ri’Vj the argument of the inappr'Opr lateness3 of moMvc
innumerable constitutional docis ions ac to whether sis out of
eight or ten out of twelve or nine out of twelve or, in Montane
eight cut rat twelve, cA infinitum, arc acceptable urcer the

S i>:fch Amendment.
I think that’s not a proper constitutional role for

the Court,

I think there must be a more- objective test to be-

applied then just juggling all these numbers, particularly in

light of Williams f where wo know at least that the number can
range.; fro:a six to twelve, and that the combinations are very,
very large.

And I just wonder, 1 think the Court ought to take

note of the fact of what it’s getting into-,

if it starts

coking innumerable determinations as to which combinations

arc enough and which are not.
How, secondly, the exclusion of minority 5.3 not an
abuse, as Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out by his questions.
If there’s a 10-to~-2 vote and the minority i.s not heard and the

verdict ie returned, that’s not an abusive matter that can be

But I think the important

point io rich whan the jury nctld otherwise hang, the resuit
is, in four out of five cases, a conviction.

Now, that8s not a

ber*efit to the defendant; that is a detriment to the defendant.
Whatever the consequences are of that, I think that, point shpul
be clear, that in four-fifths of those cases there's going to
be a conviction.
And lastly, I mould like to just note that the
citation which is not in our brief, to the constitutional
history, which makes very clear that the deletion of the
amendment to the Sixth Amendment having to do with unanimity
concerns vicinage and cot unanimity*

It's Volume 5 of the

Documentary History of the Constitution of the United States,
pages 205-06 and 210-11, in which Madison's letters make clear
what ths debate wag about, and it was net about that.
And of course; the Ninth Amendment was enacted
expressly to secure that simply because a right was not
expressly set forth in the Bill of Rights, it would not be
read to have been intended not to be secured,
