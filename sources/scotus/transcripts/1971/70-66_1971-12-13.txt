MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

in Wo. 66, Roudebush against Hartke, and 67, Sendak against
Hartke.
Mr. Schabel, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD A. SCHABEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT ROUDEBUSK
MR. SCHABEL:

May it please the Court:

These cases are here on direct appeal from an
interlocutory injunction granted by the United States DistrictCourt for the Southern District of Indiana, sitting as a threejudge court.
That court, by a 2-to-l decision, held that Article
27 of the Indiana Election Code, insofar as it establishes a
procedure for a recount of votes cast for the office of United
Staters Senator, is unconstitutional.
Further consideration of the question of this Court’s
jurisdiction has been postponed, and the hearing of the case
is on the merits.
The issues presented by the

two appeals are the same.

In addition to the jurisdictional issue, the questions
presented are as follows:
Without regard to the applicability of the antiin junction statute or to the alleged unconstitutionality of
the election code involved,- the first substantive question

4
presented is whether the interlocutory injunction is proper
under established procedures of equitable jurisprudence?
• -The second question is whether the interlocutory
injunction appealed from is prohibited by the language of the
anti-injunction statute?
And the third question presented is whether Article
2? of the Indiana Election Code, insofar as it establishes a
procedure for a recount of the votes cast for the office of
United States Senator, conflicts with Article 1, Section 5,
of the Constitution of the United States, which makes the
Senate the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications
of its members.
Now, I am dividing the time of the appellants with
Mr, Richard Johnson, so I shall discuss the jurisdictional
issue in the first questions X stated; Mr, Johnson will discuss
the second and third questions.
Before addressing myself to the question of
jurisdiction, I shall first state the relevant facts.
Appellant Roudebush and appelle Harfcke were candidates
for the office of United States Senator at the general election
held in the State of Indiana on November 3, 1.970,

The canvass

of the returns showed that Hartke had the greater number of
votes by a margin of 4,383 votes out of 1,737,797 votes,
The Indiana Election Code provides that any candidate
for any office, voted upon in any election held in the State of

3
Indiana, including specifically the office of United States
Senator, has a right to petition for a recount of the votes
cast in any voting precinct, any or all voting precincts of
the State? provided he petitions in the appropriate courts
within 15 days after the election»
Pursuant to this, appellant Roudebush filed petitions
for recount on November 17, 1970, in certain selected
precincts in 11 Indiana counties.
Hartke appeared in all

Two days later appellee

11 proceedings, and moved to dismiss

on the ground that the proceeding interfered with the prerogative
of the United States Senate under Article 1, Section 5»
On December 1, 1370, the Superior Court of Marion
County Room:'3, in which one of the proceedings was pending,
overruled Hartke’s motion to dismiss and appointed tie
appellees Samuel Walker, John Hammond, and Cure Butler as a
recount commission, directing that they convene on December 8,
IS70 and commence a recount of the votes.
On December 3, 1970, the Lake Circuit Court also
overruled Hartke8s motion to dismiss.

Instead of seeking

relief from the Supreme Court of Indiana and, if necessary,
from this Court, appellee Hartke instead filed a complaint
for injunctive relief in the court below on December 3, 1970»
ted in this complaint he recited the proceedings had in the
Marion County action, and alleged that the recount statute
conflicted with Article 1, Section 3, of the Constitution.

6
Jurisdiction was predicated under 28 United States
Code., Section 1343, subparagraph (3), which confers jurisdiction
on the district courts in civil rights actions.
Generally, the complaint alleged that the defendants,
acting under color of law, would deprive appellee Hartke of
the rights, privileges and immunities secured to him by
Article 1, Section 5, of the Constitution.
■

“This complaint contained no explanation why relief

was not sought from the Supreme Court of Indiana, and it
contains no showing of irreparable injury.
The prayer was that a three-judge court be convened
to declare Article 27 of the Election Code unconstitutional
and to restrain the defendants from proceeding with the recount.
Along with the complaint, Hartke filed a verified
application for a temporary restraining order.

In this applica­

tion he specifically alleged that he appeared in all 11 recount
proceedings and raised the constitutional question;

and he also

recited the ruling of the Marion County court against him.
Notwithstanding this, the district judge to whom the
application was presented issued a temporary restraining order
without notice, although the recount wasn't scheduled to
commence in Maries County for another five days.
Thereafter Hartke amended his complaint, and Theodore
L, Sendak, as Attorney General of Indiana, was permitted to
intervene so as to defend the — to be heard upon the

7
constitutionality of the recount statute.
Q

You say jurisdiction in the federal case was-

predicated upon Section 1343(3)?
MR. SCHABELs

But that's just a jurisdictional statute —

MR. SCHABEL:

Q

Then you're not the person to ask?

MR. SCHABEL:
Q

Yes.

In a sentence.

8
MR. SCHABEL:

That was a point we tried -*♦ w© 've

been trying to make.
On December 17, 1870, a hearing was held before a
three-judge district court, on'appellee Harfcke*s request for a
preliminary injunction? by a 2-to-l vote that court held that
Article 27 of the Indiana Election Code, so far as it applies
to

races for the United. States Senate, to be unconstitutional.

It dismissed the — the defendant’s motions to dismiss were
denied, and the interlocutory injunction requested by Hartke
was issued.
The majority and the minority of the court subse­
quently filed opinions, but made no separate findings of fact or
conclusions of law.
Thereafter both appellants Rouclebush and Sendak filed,
notices of appeal, and on January 13 and 15 of 1871, juris­
dictional statements were filed in this Court.
When the 92nd Congress convened on January 21, 1971,
by unanimous consent of the Senate the oath was administered to
appellee Hartke without prejudice to this appeal or to any
recount that might ensue,
Thereafter Hartke moved in this Court to dismiss the
appeals as moot on the grounds that the Senate had already
judged the case in his favor.
Then, on March 22nd, 1971, this Court entered an
order postponing jurisdiction.

9
Now, with respect to the jurisdictional question,
there appeared to be two aspects?

The first is the Court’s

jurisdiction of this direct appeal from the District Court;
the other aspect is appellee Harfcke8 s contention that the appeals
are moot*
With respect to jurisdiction, this Court's jurisdic­
tion, of course, is invoked under 28 United States Coda, Section
1253»

Jurisdiction under this section depends upon whether the

case was one required to be heard by a district court of three
judges»
The authority to convene the three-judge court in
this case rests on 20 United States Coda, Section 2281, which
is set out on page 8 of appellant Roudebush3s brief»
As contemplated by this section, Harfcke*s complaint
sought injunctive relief against the enforcement, operation and
execution of a State statute upon the grounds of the
unconstitutionality of that statute.

So far the case is

squarely within the statute.
But for 2281 to be applicable, the injunction must
restrain the officer of a State — restrain the action of an
officer of the State in the enforcement or execution off the
statute.
In this case, the duty to enforce the Election Recount
statute is imposed upon the Circuit and Superior Courts of
the various counties.

By seeking to restrain the appellant,

10
that’s Roudebush, from taking any actions whatsoever to effect
recount procedures under the recount statute, the injunction
is thus directed against the Circuit and Superior Courts in
which these proceedings were pending.
It's been recognized for many years that restraint
of a party initiating a proceeding is tantamount to restraint
of the court in which the proceeding is pending.
Accordingly, it follows that a three-judge court was
necessary to enter the injunction sought against appellant
Roudebush, because such injunction necessarily restrained the
action of the 11 Circuit cr Superior Courts, and the officers
thereof, in the enforcement and execution of the Indiana
Recount Statute,
How, with respect to the other aspect of jurisdiction,
I don’t think Hartke’s contention that the appeals are moot
weed detain us very long»
First, the Senate itself swore him in without
prejudice to this appeal, and to any ensuing recount, so, in
their action and their viewpoint, from their viewpoint they
judge nothing*
Secondly, the term for the seat in dispute does not
expire for another five years, until January 3, 1977, so 1
don’t think it can be said that there are not live issues
before the Court*
How, so much for the jurisdictional issue, unless

Ii
there are questions from the Court,
Q

One question.

Is there anything in the Indiana

law that would make it moot?

I mean, does the recount have to

be a certain — I know it's a certain time before, but is
there a certain time — wall, could you have a recount now?

HR. SCHABEL:

Yes,

Because we — they were all

initiated within the proper time, then suspended by this
injunction, and we're in a state of suspended animation right
now, ready to go forward once the injunction is lifted.
Now, without regard to the applicability of the antiinjunction statute, or to tye alleged unconstirationality of
the recount statute, the substantive question that I'd like to
discuss is whether the interlocutory injunction was proper under
established principles of equity jurisprudence.
It would seem to be hornbook law that courts of
equity should not act when a party has an adequate remedy at
lav;, and whan he will not suffer irreparable injury if denied'
equitable relief.

In this case, as I've already said, Senator

Hartke interposed his constitutional contentions in all 11
State pending recount proceedings.

Two of those courts

rejected his contentions and ruled against

them.

He than had an opportunity to apply to the Supreme
Court of Indiana for a writ of prohibition, to review those
questions.

And, if necessary, he had a right to appeal to this

Court, under 28 United States Code, Section 1257, subparagraph

v

12
(2) , and bring the question here.
Instead of that, he sought relief from the District
Court.

But, surely, relief from the Supreme Court of Indiana

and from this Court would constitute an adequate remedy,
precluding equitable relief,
Moreover, his complaint, neither his original
complaint nor his amended complaint makes any allegation
concerning irreparable injury.
How, it is no answer to say that he filed an applica»
tion for temporary restraining order, in which he tries to
set out alleged injury, because that application was not part
of the proceedings, and it was not even served on the defendants.
And I, myself, never first saw it until I was preparing this
appeal«
The court below, however, held as a matter of law
that Hartke would suffer irreparable injury, and the only
authority it cited was Humpty-Dumpty stating that the Harm to
foe avoided will take place immediately and irrevocably once
the case seals cm

the ballot bags are broken.

But the breaking

of the seals on the ballot bags could not cause irreparable
injury, for a number of reasons.
First, under the statute, the court in which the
recount's pending, as directed by the statute, can impound the
ballots and make an order for their protection.
Mow, it cannot be assumed or presumed that that

13
court is not going to do its duty»
Nest, so long as the ballots are preserved intact,
it doesn't — it makes no — it's of no consequence how they
were originally counted or sorted.
And, finally, since the Senate is the judge of the
elections and returns of its members,neither the original
count nor the recount is binding on them.

So, regardless of

what happens during the recount, if-it's not binding on the
Senate, it cannot cause irreparable injury to Senator Hartke.
Q

Haven't there, Mr. Schabei, as a matter of fact,

been, in our history, many, many recounts in senatorial
elections?
MB,. SCKABEL:
Q

Yes.

Wasn't there one in the contest between Senator

Morse and Senator Packwood?
;

MR. SCHABELt

Yes, in I960, and no challenge to the

legality of it was made, that I can determine.

ORAL, ARGUMENT OF RICHARD C. JOHNSON, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT SEMDAK
MR. JOHNSON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;

My task is a doubly difficult cne because ranch of the
ground that I was going to trod or plow has been taken by
the previous case.

In fact, a better argument was presented

at that time tlian perhaps X can present right now.
I would like to advance two points to the Court,
which, in the opinion of the appellants, require reversal.
The first is that the provisions of 2283 are
applicable to this case.

As the Court knows, this Act is

written in plain and clear language, and provides that no
injunction shall issue to stay any State court proceeding.
The Act, with minor changes, as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out

15
in the previous case, dates back to X793.

Thera are only

three —•
Q

May 1 just ask this;

I gather there's no

question, no claim that the recount proceeding in year Circuit
or Superior, whatever the court is, is a State court
proceeding? is that in issue?
MR» JOHNSON;

There is --- that is an issue, Mr.

Justice Brennan, and the appellant claims that since the
State court proceeding, namely recount, is a ministerial and
a non-adversary proceeding, that it is not a State court
proceeding within the meaning of 2233»
\

Q

Well, are the commissioners appointed much like

Special Masters are appointed by a court historically?
MR. JOHNSON;
Q

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

The statute provides for the appointment of

these officers?
MR. JOHNSON; These officers are officere of the
court? they have to be appointed by the court. The court is
under a duty by statute to preserve the integrity of the
ballots.

And as far as a nonadversary proceeding is

concerned, the appellee himself filed two preliminary motions
in two different proceedings? motions to dismiss.,

Both of

those motions were ruled adversely to the appellee, and ha
chose to fight his fight in the foriita of the federal district
court

16
Q

I suppose the appointment of these commissioners

or special officers is an alternative to having Stats court
judges sit down and count a million and a half votes themselves;
is that correct or -MR. JOHNSON:

I would say that's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice ? and 1 would also add that the appellee in the lower
court, in my opinion, failed to distinguished between election
contests and a recount procedure.
The Indiana lav? provides for both types of proceeding.
In election contests, the distinction is this:

that in an

election contest it is an adversary proceeding and no recount
commission, as such, is appointed.

However, in a recount, of

course, there is a retabulation of the vote after the
commissioners of the recount commission have been appointed by
the court,
Q f

Have your State courts ever had occasion to

consider whether a recount proceeding was a judicial as opposed
to a ministerial proceeding?
MR. JOHNSON:

Not to my knowledge, Mr. Justice

Brennan.

Q

Mr. Johnson, in Indiana, you have a court

proceeding to appoint a guardian or a trustee? is that a court
proceeding?
MR„ JOHNSON:

Q

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Is there any parallel there to this kind of thing?

17
MR, JOHNSON:
of it,

If there's a parallel, I'm not aware

But I will say this:

the commissioners —• the parallel

is probably this, that the commissioners — if there is one —
that the commissioners do report to the court,

The court has

jurisdiction at all times over the activity of the commissioners.
tod the court is under a duty, as X said before, to preserve
the integrity of the ballots,
Q

Well, could the — could your court remove a

commissioner in the midst of the recount?
MR, JOHNSON:

My understanding is the court could

remove one or could remove the entire commission at any time
during the procedure if, in the court's opinion, the commission
did not follow the mandate of the statute itself,
Q

Could the court determine whether the procedures

followed by the commissioners are proper or Illegal?
MR, JOHNSONs

Yes, the court could make that

determination, and, in fact, the court is under a mandatory duty
by the statute to make such a determination.
Now, the appellee argues that at one point in the
lower court reason, that this was a case analogous to a civil
rights case, and depended on a case, Baines, which has been
alluded to before in the prior case, Baines v. City of Danville,
for its authority to issue the injunction.
The Baines case was a true civil rights ease,

This

action does not involve any First Amendment right, violation of

18
any First Amendment right.
There is no criminal prosecution under a State
statute which was invalid on its face; no prosecution conducted
in bad faith, or for the purpose of harassment.
It does not involve a statute, as I say, which was
unconstitutional on its face.
The second point that I would like to bring up, to
bring to the Court's attention is the constitutionality of
the Indiana recount statute.
Q

The complaint does allege the provision of

privileges and immunities?
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes.

And it's up to this Court to see

if this particular case fits that category,. Justice Douglas.
Q

Wasn’t it up to the three-judge court to look

into that, to see whether that was a sham case or whether it
had a basis?
MR. JOHNSON;

Yes, and the court did hear one,witness.

It, first of all, issued a temporary restraining order without
notice to the parties.

And then the court heard one witness

at an evidentiary hearing.
recount, at a prior time.

We had the experience of one
He was a member of a recount

commission duly appointed by the court.
The lower court further reasoned that the Indiana
recount statute is unconstitutional, and in violation of
Article 1, Section 5, of the United States Constitution, 'which

provides,, very briefly, that the Senate is the body which
determines the election and qualifications of its members.
However, Article 1, Section 4, imposes a duty on the
State to prescribe the places, time, and manner of holding
elections for Senators and Representatives.
It is our contention that the Indiana recount
statute is more analogous to counting a vote than it is to an
election contest.
■The recount statute, although the recount commission,
is appointed by the court, and so forth, the recount commission
simply retabulates the vote.

This, of course, under the

supervision of the court.
The lower court railed on three decisions of the
Indiana Supreme Court.

I think it5a significant to realize

that from the record the appellee chose not to take its case
through the State court procedure, but chose, instead, to go
directly to the federal court, after having lost his case on
the motions to dismiss in the lower court.
Two of these three decisions which were relied on
— are relied on by the appellee, were decided prior to the
1981 amendment of the recount, Indiana recount statute.
The amendment provided that the recount would be
used for informational purposes, and would not supersede any
previously issued certificates of election.
Logically, the amendment would apply to races for the

20

Uo S. Senate, since the Indiana and Federal Constitutions
have primarily identical provisions.
In addition# it is the appellants* case that a
recount stands on the same footing as the original count; that
a recount is merely a retabulation of the votes.

The appellee

will counter that argument by saying that# well# while judgment
is exercised by a recount commission; I would answer that by
saying that judgment is exercised when the vote is tabulated
initially.

That is, it acts within a circle which is without

a — if the vote has been cast by a machine, whether it has
been counted or not.
The Supreme Courts of the States of Minnesota,
Georgia, and Oklahoma have held that a recount procedure does
not violate the provisions of Article 1, Section 5, of the
U. S. Constitution, providing the procedure is an integral
part of the Election Code of the State.
And this is the fact In the. State of Indiana.
The reasons for having a recount procedure are
compelling.

In Indiana, as in many States, the polls are open

from 6s00 a„m. until 6;00 p.m.

Members of the Precinct

Election Boards have had a long day by the time the polls close.
However, afterward, they must count the votes and certify the
results to the County Board.
The members of the Precinct Election Board,' in many
cases, are housewives, anxious to gat home to the family.

21
What I am trying to bring to ths Court5s attention
is, simply, that the chance of error in the initial tabulation
increases.

There 9 s a direct relationship between the chance

of error and the physical well-being of the precinct election
board.
Therefore, it's incumbent to have seme sort of a
recount procedure.
In view of the safeguards present in the statute,
and the fact that the procedure is and has been an integral
part of the Indiana election code since 1945, the appellant
respectfully submits that there is no conflict with Article X,
Section 5, of the U. S, Constitution.
I’ll sit down if the Court has no questions.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Johnson,
Mr, Dillon,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. DILLON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. DILLONs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

1 would like to just review the atmosphere that
surrounded thin lawsuit, so that you might understand the factual
situation.
unlike many of the cases that have been argued
here today# this was a factual situation in which facts were
\

22
presented, credible witnesses —a credible witness was
presented, and the facts were unconrixoverted.
So the facts underlying this case, as shown in our
Appendix, are extremely important.
Q

Are you speaking of the litigation not? in the

State court or in the federal court?

MR. DILLONs

No, sir? in the federal court.

Evidence was introduced in the federal court that
the thrust of which proved that this was in fact a contest,
be it. a rose by any other name, that what is done in Indiana
is in. fact a contest.
That evidence, by a credible witness, uncontroverted,
was introduced and is in the Appendix.
How, here was the situation —
Q

Well, what was the relief asked for in the State

Court?
MR. DILLONs

In the State court? the State court, six",

was a petition for recount under the State statute.
Q

But you say in fact it was —

MR. DILLON:
Q

h contest.

~~ more than a recount.

MR. DILLON:

It was a contest.

hs the Indiana Supreme Court has three times held,
declaring this very statute to be unconstitutional.
was amended and after it was amended.

Before it

Wherein the argument is

23
made that — well, after the amendment, it became a discovery
statute»

But, in fact, in Bafcchelet, cited by our court,

our Supreme Court r the Indiana Supreme Court said it violates
Article 4, Section 10, of the Constitution of Indiana, which is
& mere image of Article 1, Section 5,of the Federal Constitu­
tion .
So three times our highest court has struck down this
statute as saying that it could not apply to a member of the
Indiana General Assembly,
Now, there are 4,400 precincts in Indiana,

They

petitioned in 11 counties, 440 precincts in 11 counties, out
of 4,GO0-plus precincts.

In one of the counties, the one in

which, the principal ease came up in to the federal court, came
over into the federal court, it was fragmentary, just part of
the precincts.
How, the court was moving.

Commissioners ware being

appointed? 33 commissioners were being appointed in 33 different
State jurisdictions.

As shown by the evidence and by the law

of Indiana, the appellant's party controlled every precinct in
Indiana, all 4,400 of them,
By that I mean the judge and the inspector in the
majority party, which was the appellant's, controlled every
precinct, giving them the opportunity to make the original
judgment, as stated by counsel, as each person came to the
polling place.

24
In Marion County, the Election Board, by virtue of the
fact that his party has cast the highest number of votes at the
previous election, was controlled by appellant's party.
The canvassing board, which does check arithmetical errors,
was controlled by appellant's party.
Now, in that atmosphere, and 2 must be candid to tell
you, every judge in Indiana at this time was also selected on
a partisan politica? ballot, right along with the County
Treasurer and. the County Clerk.

And our Supreme Court and

appellate court judges are likewise selected.
So, you see the atmosphere

in the United States

Senate race between two strong political parties.
was the atmosphere.

And the recount proceeded.

Now, that
All right.

It was at that point that we had to look at the
Indiana statute on recounts, which had been thrice declared to
be unconstitutional„
Q

That is violative of the Indiana Constitution?

MR. DILLONs

Article 4, Section 10, of the Indiana

Constitution, which says the General Assembly shall be the
judge of the election qualifications and returns of the members
of the General Assembly.

A mere image of the Article 1,

Section 5, which says the United States Senate will be the
judge of the election returns and the qualifications of the
Senator.
All right„

25
Q

Do you feel that is binding on the Federal

determination here?
MR. DILL:CM:
otherwise.

I can't sea how logica could prove

There is no decision any place that says that this

is not true, that I can find, that if you get into judging the
Senator’s race, the jurisdiction is in the Senate.

Now, these

recount commissions were proceeding to judge the Senatorial
race.

That’s the thrust of this lawsuit.
Q

Of course, you're on the merits now,

You will

get to the jurisdiction?
MR. DILLONs
Jurisdiction:

Oh, yes.
we predicate it on 1343(a) and

Article 1, Section 5, of the Constitution.
Q
mR.

Q

You don’t need any —
DILLON s

Well ~

— statute permitting jurisdiction?

MR. DILLONs That question was never raised in the
trial court.

But I say this, we’re here now as the appellees.

And if the judgment was solid, then it was solid,

And I say

that in Powell vs, McCormack this Court said that the jurisdic­
tion under 1331(a), the general jurisdiction statute, is valid.
So, if that be true, then we're entitled to that position,
because we’re here as the appellees.
Q

And we got the order,

How about under 2283?

MR. DILLONs

2283, I'll get to — doyou want me to

26
reach this now?
Q

No, no, you take it your way*

MR* DILLON:
O

All right.

While you*re hesitating hero for a minute, let

me asic you about this jurisdictional point*
MR. DILLON:
Q

Yes, sir*

Iff in fact, there was no jurisdiction in the

three-judge District Court, I assume you mean, when you refer
to trial court you’re talking about the three-judge District
Court?
MR* DILLON:

Yes, sir*

We don't consider — we

don't consider the State court in this instance as the trial
court, which I'll get to in a moment,
Wall, if in fact, there was a jurisdictional

Q

informity, does it make any difference whether anyone raises
it at any time?
DILLON:

Ho, I suppose not.

If it’s juris­

dictional
Q

If you raised it

MR* DILLON:

regionally here —

— no, I suppose not.

If it was

jurisdiction as to subject matter, I would, so- concede.
Nevertheless, it was not argued — I mean, the lack of the
pleading position was not argued, and the court mentioned
Title 42, 1983? and the Court here — but here, assume that
we’re correct, that there is a — we all would agree, if we

27
could agree to that, there was a clear violation to Article 1,,
Section 5,

Then 1343(3) says we can go into District — if the

law provides, we can go into the District Court and get relief»
Ml right»
Q

But the trouble with that, what about the

Supreme Court of Indiana's point that they have a right to
just see, not that they can do anything about it —
MR, DILLON: Do what, sir?
Q

Just tell them.

MR. DILLON:

That is the Supreme Court of Indiana’s

position?
Sir, I do not view that to bs their position.
Q

That they can just recount them; isn’t that

what they said in the last case?
MR. DILLON:

No, sir,

Three times they have said

and the last time being that in the case of a member of the
Indiana Legislature, that this statute was unconstitutional.
Q

Mid that you couldn't have a recount?

MR. DILLON:

Yes, sir.

Three times the Supreme

Court struck down the very statute.
Now, the only basis that they can say —Q

Then you can't have a recount

MR. DILLON% Sir?
Q

Then you cannot have it ~~

MR. DILLON:

Not for members of the Legislature or

the United States Senate or Congress»
Q

Well, who can you have it for?

MR. DILLON;

Q

The cog catcher?

Yes.

x se©,

MR. DILLON;

Yes.

Because the dog catcher isn’t

proscribed by Article 1, Sfsction 5, or Section -Q

And the mayors and the Governor and —

Mi. DILLON;

Q

Not the Governor.

Mot the Governor?

MR. DILLON?

Not the Governor, because, you see,

'■■r en they amended the statute they said the Lieutenant
Governor, the Governor, and members of the General Assembly —
0

How about mayors?

MR. DILLON:

Yes, you. could for mayors.

You could for mayors,
Q

Judges are elected, are they?

MR. DILLON;
political ballot.
Q

Judges are sleeted on a partisan

They are.

Could there he a recount there?

MR, DILLONs For judge?
Q

There could be?

MR. DILLON;
Q

I believe there could be.

I think so.

1 think so.

Mr. Dillon, tell me one© again why an Indiana

^ecision, base2d on Indiana constitutional provision, is binding
for Federal Constitutional purposes,

29
MR. DILLON':

Well, I say that the Court was justified

— there is no logical difference between the rationale of the
Indiana courts deciding that a member of the Legislature cannot
b© contested except in the Legislature then saying that a member
of the United States Senate cannot be contested anywhere except
in the Senate.

Ana the reasoning in the. cases cited, in

Batchlet, Beaman, and Acker in Indiana cases, which ' •
upon, are identical with the reasoning in Barry vc.
Q

relied

•hvuu.ngham.

Well, the rational difference might be that

we might disagree with the Indiana courts.
MR, DILLONs That's true.

That is true.

But I know of no legal historical precedes

where that

is true, Your Honor? in each case there is no precedent that
says that if it's a matter of contest that it does not belong

xn the legislature, or legislative body.

Be it the State

Assembly or be it the National Congress.
Q

Well, there's some — something might depend upon

whether or not this is classified as a recount or a contest.
MR. DILLON:

Precisely, Your Honor.

Pre d. oly.

And I say that our evidence shows **Q

That it is a contest -«

MR. DILLON;

— that it is a contest and the Supreme

Court of Indiana, three times, said it was unconstitutional.
That’s the only basis it could be unconstitutional on.

It

a^tempted to judge the right of a member of the Indiana General

30
Assembly,, under Article 4, Section 1.0, of the Indiana
Constitution», which is identical to Article 1, Section 5, of
the Federal Constitution.
Q

well, what if the report of the commi ssloners

here was simply to say they have canvassed all of the ballots
and that the true and correct count is ss follows, end said
nothing else?
MR. DILLON:

If there were a ~~ if the statute

provided for & simple, arithmetical determination, as the
canvassing board did in this case ~ and, incidentally, did
make some mathematical changes in the very county ix question,
and forwarded those.

That's one thing.

But the evidence was, and the fact is that they
proceed to get into the paper ballots.

And they proceed to

make judgments again on how the precinct people com..tad these
ballots.

And the undisputed evidence was that the fact is,

and even in our court decisions, they even have printed where
the Supreme Court judges have said. Well, that X is too far,
and that check is wrong? so that is where we get into the
judgment quality of this statute.

Q

Well, but after contests or recounts or whatever

name you give them are held, they always come either to the
House or the Senater and the House or the Senate, ae the case
may be, exercises a new and original and independent judgment,
do they not?

Ah, but our statute does not so provide.

MR. DILLON:

Q

Well, you have already argued

MR. DILLON:
Q

They should.

You. already argued that the Senate is the

final judge —
MR. DILLONi
Q

--

Yes, sir.

aRr^ ^3reiore

Senate and the House, as

a roafctar of fact, have never accepted State findings on this,
have they?

As final and binding?
MR. DILLON:
Q

Not to ray knowledge.

They corae before a subcommittee, and they have

a hearing and if there is a dispute over ballots or a dispute
over ballots or a dispute over the count —
MR. DILLON?

Q

Yes,

■

•

The Senate or the House makes the final

decision.
MR. DILLON:
Q

That is correct.

But can- they do that if they haven't got a

c°unt?
MR. DILLON:

Q

They have a count, hare.

Well —

MR. DILLONs And they have a certificate presented
if ■

by the Secretary of State to the Governor, and by the Governor
to Senator Hartke.. and presented by Senator H&rfcke to the United

32
States Senate,,

They have a count»

Nov;,» to go behind that count,, if the statute
provided for a pure arithmetical recounting, that’s one thing?
but the evidence here was, and the fact was, and the.' Indiana
Supreme Court has three times found, that it's a contest when
You get into judging the validity of these ballots for a
member of the General Assembly or the United States Senate or
Congress.
I think that logically follows» because those
precedents are all footed and founded upon the same principle.
Q

Well, a county, in the first place, thoughf

requires judging ballots, doesn’t it?
M3U DILLON:
Article 1, Section 4«
Q

That does? it does.

That comas under

You have to start some place*

Yes, you have to start, and the State, I think,

has authorised to count the ballots -~
MR. DILLON:
Q

It is.

— their system, and in those instances it

judges ballots, doesn’t it?
MR. DILLON:

It does.

Those three people appointed

by Congressman Roudebush'a party did do that, yes.
Q

So if the State says this counting procedure

lsn8t over yet, we have some procedures to go through yet,
why isn’t it authorised to do that even if it involved doing
what it has already done, judging the

ballots?

33
HR. DILLONs

If

they cannot judge the ballots,

they can recount the ballots.
Q

Well, I know, but In the first place they

counted them and judged the ballots?
MR. DILLON;
Q

They did.

Now, why can’t they do it over again?

MR. DILLON;

Because that’s not a continuation of

fcha election process under Article 1, Section 4.

That becomes

a —
Q

But you said they could count them over?

MR. DILLON;
Q

Yes,

Provided they don’t —

You don’t think you. can do the same thing in

counting them again that you did in counting them in the first
Place?
ISR. DILLON;

Ah, that's the count-’em-the-first-time

Count—f ©m—the—second—time argument out of Laxalt-Cannon and the
Wickershaia case.
fine.

And if that’s all they did was count them,

>
Q

Well, they're not doing any more on the second

go-around than they did on the first?
MR. DILLON;
Q

Quite to the contrary.

Well, on the first go-around they had to judge

the ballots.
MR. DILLON: Quite to the contrary.

As the evidence

showed, there, thay’re making a judgment on what was done at

34
the precinct polling place, and the evidence showed there was
no way to unscramble that, and that8 s wherein the irreparable
harm was*

They could : never get to the Senate and determine

how that judgment was made by the recount commission if that
©vidence wasn't maintained until it went to the United States
, f

Senate„
And, internestingiy enough, a year has passed over,
an*3 no petition has ever been presented to the United States
senata by the appellant herein asking for a contest of this
election.
Now, it is, of course, an argument between Article 1,
Section 4, Article 1, Section 5? but our evidence shows that
this violated Article 1, Section 5.

It got into the prerogatives

of the Senate„

Now, *—
Q

How does it take anything away from the Senate

as long as the Senate has the final word on the recount?

‘

M3e DILLON; Because the evidence there would ha
irreparably co-mingled, and it would be impossible for the
Sanate to determine how the recount commission viewed what the
Precinct commission did®
Q

Well, isn’t it the custom to certify the ballots

and actually deliver them physically to the Senate, or the
House, including in. a separate, impounded group all those which
are contested, or questioned, or challenged?

35
MR* DILLON: The. Senate has no specific rules on it,
they proceed ad hoc on these matters, but that is the custom,

yes.
Q

That is the custom?

MR* DILLONs

Yes*

Let rae say that' it has been dons

in Senatorial recount or contest cases*
But that was part of our equity, that, we felt like
we were entitled to in the — and the three-judge. District
Court so ruled, that once those recount commissioners start
rejudging this and say, Oh, no, this -- the evidence all
c,are£ully lays out exactly how this was done, and how they
9°t into these paper ballots, which were in all the precincts.
Some paper ballots in all the precincts*
Now, the machine, you see, is no problem.

shows, some are in a rejected bag*
proceed to redo that,

Now, these commissioners

One of the counties, even though the

State statute requires the whole county to be on machine,
Wayne County, as the evidence shewed, was all on paper ballots*
So here we have all of these commissions, 11 different
commissions proceeding to make judgments on those ballots
which, were cast, and the court found, on the evidence, that
that belonged in the United States Senate*

36
Q

Has a federal court ever enjoined a state recount

board in any case that you know of?
MR. DILLON: Well, I don't —I have found that in
every case where it violated Article 1, Section 3, they have
said that they could not permit it to go forward.
Q

lire they cited in the brief?

2 didn't identify

those cases.
MS. DILLON:

Well, in L&asalt vs. Cannon, they said

that they granted the relief there, and then went on, and
there was a recount before the contest, you see.

There was

no question raised about the recount in the Lanait vs. Cannon
and it went on to say that the Senate is the judge under
Article X, Section 3.
So, presumably, in

t vs. Cannon, if there had

been — if in fact their recount was the kind of recount we
have, and that's the emphasis of this lawsuit, what this
recount constitutes, and what we say is that it constitutes a
contest, and our Supreme Court of Indiana, three times said
the same thing, as we see it.

We can't see how there's any

cavil in that argument.
But, nevertheless, it’s been raised, and we're trying
to meet it.
Now, we went into the federal court and made a
Federal Constitutional claim,

A Federal Constitutional claim.

Article 1, Section 5, of the Constitution.

There is no

37
underlying State question involved, because if the State law
Question was clear, as we see it, three times the Supreme
Court had said that it was not a valid, a vioable statute so
far as the State Legislature was concerned.

Nov/, we think

it’s only reasonable, if that bs true, and that were the
underlying constitutional basis, that that certainly is true
-or the office of United States Senator.
Now, motions were filed under 2283, in the federal
court.

And we met those, and we meet them now in theory, that

this is not the type of proceeding that 2283 prohibits granting
an injunction against.

These commissioners — this .is not

court litigation, because there is no appeal in Indiana from a
recount.

There is no appeal.

You can’t do anything, and

law says ~
Q

Well, how did three cases get there?

MR. DILLON: Sir?
Q

Writ of prohibition.

Well, why don51 you take that, then?

MR. DILLON:

All right.

The State court remedy used in Batchlet was «—
Q

I mean where you have three cases that you say

are absolute, sure-fire precedents, why did you go to the
federal court?
MR. DILLON:

Well, I'll explain that.

First of all, I think —
Q

You didn't —

38
MR.DILLONs

Why don't we go for writ of prohibition?

All through the brief, I indicate that writ of
prohibition is a simple remedy.

Well, that depends on what the

factual situation is and how fast things are moving.
Mow, our Indiana writ of prohibition, under the rules
I

of our procedure, requires that, first of all, if: an emergency
writ is not granted, and it's very difficult to get emergency
writ, then the petition for the temporary writ of prohibition
or alternative writ of mandate must lay over seven days, and
that they only hear them at 2 o’clock on Monday»
All right.

Now, if you file on Tuesday, and you

don't get a hearing on your temporary emergency, then you
couX$ be put off 13 days.
Mow, on this two courts have overruled us, our
motion to dismiss, on the ground they were violating Article 1,
Section 5, of the Federal Constitution, not the State
Constitution.

So we went to federal court to gat a restraining

order, to stop if, to hold it, to see whether we were right «»

Constitution, on a Saturday, —

three prior decisions.

That’s the only way you can lose.

MR. DILLONS
Q

Yes.

But you preferred to come over to the federal

court; ?

MR. DILLON:

We thought we were — for two reasons?

we thought that# under the fact situation# it was our
judgment that the writ of prohibition was not an expeditious
Remedy, but# snore importantly, before this Court, we didn’t
think we£ d have to exhaust this straight remedy or we could
go into the federal court on a federal question, without an
underlying statement of State question.

Wa didn’t sea any ques­

tion of abstention or comity involved in this.
So we went to the federal court.

We got a restraining

order# and then we got a temporary injunction after s. full-:
-scale hearing where evidence was had.
»

Now, the question said?

was there any Indiana

precedent that said that this is a ministerial proceeding?
Tha answer to that it? yes.

There are two precedents cited in
•>

°»r brief j

Watson vs. Pigc? and State ex rel McCormick.

Q

Bo they say ministerial or non-judicial this

^ime?
MR» DILLON: Botht

They're intermixed.

Bat they

3ay that they're not — that the kind of animal that we say
we’re talking about in a 2283 prohibition against granting them
aR injunction; and we cite many authorities that support that
position, that there were not proceedings in a State court,
which were specifically prohibited under Younger,

Certainly

they're not criminal prosecutions, and Watson vs, l>igg and the
State ess re.l McComick, one was a prosecutor, one was a county
auditor, and they describe these people as ministerial, and
x Relieve counsel in appellant's brief concedes, or at least

argues hhe same way, that these are ministerial proceedings,
not judicial proceedings;

or that they are non-judicial

proceedings.
Nov?, the next question is, of course, does Younger
apply?

We say not

We say it doss not apply for the reason that

these are not State court proceedings under 2283»

And I would

•^-he to also cite the case of Hcbbs^ys« Thompson which was
previously cited, because again it was not exactly a 2283 case;
but it does give an excellent review of what the Younger
decisions made, and were called this February Sextet of
Decisions in Younger»

And Judge Goldberg, in that case, which

has been previously cited here, gives his view, and a very
rational view of the application of 2283«

41
Nov;, after this case was tried, and herein courses a —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Excuse me.

We511 finish

today, and you have sowe time left.
MR* DILLON;

Fifteen minutes by ray computation.

But I ~
At any rate, prior to the taking — well, first of
ail, the certificate was issued»
January 21st, he was seated.

Hartke presented himself on

The Senator Curtis motion said

that he would be seated with unanimous consent, without
prejudice to this appeal pending in the Supreme Court, and
recognising that this Supreme Court might order a recount; or
words to that affect.
How, I suggest to you that that language is
completely negatory.

It means nothing.

seated just like every other Senator.

Senator Hartke is
He's seated subject to

Article 1, Section 5, of the Constitution.
Q

Then we shouldn’t really be here today.

MR. DILLONs

That is my next point.

We filed a motion to dismiss, and we cited Barry vs.
Cunningham.

Now, it is a 1929 case, involving Senator Vare.

But the fact is, as far as I can see, that case has not been,
in any way, trampled upon in any of these decisions.
And every decision underlying the State court,
be they federal or be they State court, or be they State
Legislature, or be they Federal Legislature, when the Senator

or Assemblyman seats himself or is seated, then this thing moves
into that body? and that's what Senator Vare said, that's what
the Barry vs. Cunningham, involving Senator Vare, said? he
was seated.

And this matter is now for the United States

Senate.to determine.

1 cannot see what can be done at this point, except
let this matter go to the United States Senate.
Now, it is true, because we went to Federal District
Court, to press a federal claim, a federl Constitutional
claim under Article 1, Section 5? I raise the question, why
does not the appellant go, after a year, to the United Spates
Sanate, where he can get all the relief that he could ask for,
if he could convince the Senate that he is correct in his
position.
So there is not really — this case is not? moot.

'
i

It was & case when we tried it in the federal District Court,
but once he became seated in the United States Senate, under
§h© rule of Barry vs„ Cunningham, this case is moot.
Q

We11, what could the Senate do now?

MR. DILLON:
Q

What could they do now?

Hew that

he8s seated,

what could the Senate

do now, though?

MR. DILLON:

Oh, they could petition the Senate and

ask for a recount.

Q

Now?

After the Senator is seated?

I think they could, yes, sir.

I think that's — 1 think you see — yes, I do,

That's the normal

And I —
0

Well, he's already been seated as if elected,

for a year,
MR. DILLON:

Yes, sir.

He has been seated.

January

21st of 1970.
Q

Well, if he's been seated, that's the end of it,

both in the Senate and in the courts?
MR. DILLON:

That of course is our position, and

we filed a motion to dismiss —
Q

And you argue, too, that since he's been

seated, they could not now undertake a recount in the Senate?
MR. DILLON: Well, I don't- know what the Senate can
ci©

because they ad»s<pt different rules on these cases as they

90

along, you see? and I hate to say —

44
Q

Wall, as my brother Stewart said, you don't

have to answer that»
Q

You are here in the Court,, all you need to

do is —
MR» DILLONs
Q

Yes, sir,

— to convince the Court that he's bean seated,

MR, DILLONs

Yes, sir.

But I know that he has been

seated.
Q

And you can make that other argument over there*

MR, DILLON:

Yes, sir.

And of course we’ll raise the

doctrine of laches if we get to the Senate a year later, because
the fact is these machines have been cleared., and pictures
have been taken, and. how — but that's not before this Court.
But the jurisdictional question under Article 1,
Section 5, is certainly here.
like every other Senator,

He has been seated.

Just

And this language in the Senator

Curtis motion has no constitutional effect.
Q

Well, was the Senate, in putting that language

in, just being polite to the Supreme Court?
Was that
MR. DILLONs

I would hope so, Your Honor.

And that

would be a new departure in some regard, I suppose? but I
— seriously, 1 don’t think it means a thing constitutionally.
1 think he sits there just like every other Senator, subject
to being proved that he wasn't elected, and the place that you

prove that is in the United States Senate.

Now, that is the

ruling precedent of this Court, under Barry vs» Cunningham.
And the remarkable thing, even the late

cases, be that La. sea It

or be they Wicker sham, when they get into this. —
Q

Those were State cases.

MR. DILLONj

All right.

But they all fall back —

you. see, the Constitutional provision in every State is very
nearly identical to the Federal Constitutional provision in
Article 1, Section 5, and they all fall back to the same argument 2
well, the legislative body is the judge of the election
Returns and qualifications of the member.
Now, we're talking about the election returns and.
qualifications of a United States Senator.

How can it not —

why should it not be presented to the United States Senate?
Why should it not have been presented there in the f. rst instance?
We filed a motion to dismiss on this point.

The

court dafered the jurisdictional question until today, as I
understand it, and 7, want to press strongly the point that he
is seated? and, u'nder Barry vs. Cunningham, that 1 believe that
and Flask vs. Cohen, and this case, 1 think it’s noofc.

I

don't think anything can be done.
The State recounts, as in the various — there are
all kinds of different cases.
say they're not.

Some say they are valid, soma

And you have to look at the various State

laws to determine whether they would be valid measured against

46
Article 1, Section 5,
But looking at our recount statute, and what Laxalt
y» Cannon says about Nevada’s case, and what Wicksrsham says
about the case in that State, or the Minnesota case, Odecrard,
we know what the Indiana courts have held,

They’ve held that

the statute is unconstitutional, that it violates Article 1?
Section 5.
Now, the trial court did mention, as I said,
Title 42, 1983 of the Civil Rights Act,
with this question.

We trouble ourselves

How do you go in, assuming we’re right,

fcliafc out her® is a body, a ministerial body, absolutely
violating the Senate’s prerogative under Article 1, Section 5,
which we though w@ proved, and the court thought we proved,
and we believe the evidence shows that vra meticulously put the
evidence in, so it wouldn’t get up here, and say, Well, it's
a facial argument.

On its face they say recount.

So if, on its face, it says recount, if you can count
them once, you can count them twice argument; so we said you've
got to prove that you don't do that.

And we did prove it.

And the court so found, that this is a contest,
That moves it into Article 1, Section 5, that moves
it into tbs Senate,
The more important thing, I think, is that there is
no question that the facts show that the Congressman,
appellant Hartke — appellant Roudebush had control of the

polling places, his party had control of the re-count comiss ion,
had control of the canvassing board, now they wanted to get
into a further contest- they wanted to go into II separate
counties, isolated precincts in souse cases, and rehash those
judgments.

She court found, properly, as the Indiana Supreme

Court had found three times, that that violated Article 1,
Section 5„
We don’t think ifc*s a question of exhaustion of
*
State remedies, we don’t think a writ of prohibitio? would be
necessary, we think we can go to the federal court and press a
federal claim, where there is no uncertainty in the State law.
And we did so.
Thank you. Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

You have three minutes remaining, counsel.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD C. JOHNSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT SENDAK
MR. JOHNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I'll be very brief, but Mr. Justice Marshall already
asked the question that I had in my mind, and that is simply
if the Indian© recount statute is so unconstitutional, why
didn't the appelles seek redress there?
As far as the question of the seating of Senator
Hartke making the case before us moot is concerned, Senator

48
Harfcke was asked to step aside at the time the oath was
administered, and a separate oath was administered to him,
J-r- which he swore to abide by the Constitution and so forth,
but subject to this appeal that is now pending»

And it is
i

contention that this was a conditional seating and c.oesn5
in fact moot this particular case*
The Indiana recount statute

just one further

P°int — the Indiana recount statute is in aid of the
Senate*3 power to judge the election of its members, not
in derogation of it.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER %

Thank you, gentlemen»

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 3:12 p.rn., the case was submitted.)
