MR. CHIEF JUSTICE SUFFERS

We will hear arguments

now in McClanahan against Morauer £ Kartzell* 5097.
Mr. Smith, you may proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN LOUIS SMITH, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, SMITH:

Mr, chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
vj chief isoue in this case involves Section 933(g)
of tl

men6

which :*?! the Longshoreman*s and Harbor Workers* Compensation
Act.

It involve? the use of the term "compromise* involving

settlements in which the insurance carrier for the workmen's
compensation company hasn6t participated.
For a brisf history of the cases

Mr. McClanahan,

the petitioner, was injured on the job in October of 1962.
He seasonably filed an action in the Workmen’s Compensation —
or

tha

Bureau of Employees1' Compensation in

the

District of

Columbia, and also a third-party action was filed against a
third*"!arty fcort-foa^or, in the U, S. District Court in the
District of Columbia»
Firs
of $7730; in 196C.
la February of 1967.

ahicn claim was settled, award was made
The third-party action tarns up for trial
At that time a settlement was macks in

th© chambers e>7 Fudge Luther Youngdahl, in which an award of

4
$5,000 was made? $3,000 of which went to Mr. McCXsnahan5s
wife on consortium, and the balance of $2,000 want to the
claimant, Mr. McCXanahan.
A motion to modify the workman’s compensation sward
was then filed, which was am# 1967, three years after the
origins! claim had been filed, before the Deputy Commissioner.
A • hearing was held in * December of *6? and April of *68
, in
which fchs Deputy Commissioner asked what issues ware before
him. and k$ was .adviaed that it was just the issue of the
compromise as to whether or not this :...was a judicial evaluate
mad© by this consent judgment in the third-party case.
•i'lie Deputy Commissioner, having heard all this
evidence, made a finding that it was a judicial evaluation,
end made a temporary partial diaability- award of 25 percent,
which he stated ended in November of 1965, and that the
claimant's conditfea reverted back to his status sis of that
time.
Motioni- ■.<*

summary judgment were filed in the

0. 3« District Couxf-, in which both sides argued that th©
findings did not

■ were not sustained by sufficient evidence.

Judge- f, ■ t, ruled in favor of the respondent in this
case, ancat it was 'not © judicial evaluation, that
it wac a c-axprorafe

and that, therefore, the claimant could

not return to the Dispensation Board for further money.
‘fhis we a appealed to 'ilia United States District Court,

they, sffirmra-ci,,

lading fcbrea distinctions between this

case mid SfenkGrab, a Gratia.arara tr;■;■colation.f 1968
decision of the Unifcad States Supreioa court*

They felt that

it was distinguishable, first of all» on the grounds that it
was not the result — the compromise was not th® result of a
full hearing of all the evidence.

Secondly, that the Chicago

Grain Trimmers did involve a remittitur,. and because of this the
party did not feat*© to accept it, that this was a judicial
evaluation by a judge, 'presumably just finding that hie
valuation of the claim varied from that of the jury, and he
- t‘ivd t;M« righfs to aGfrara th© parties th© remittitur if they
wished fc© wish to set it»

-■ - .

thsro, that they xasr© fr©a' to reject this,, and'
'••bin. "eras to reject* resulted in prejutiic© to th© employer
s.;cd his carrier»
How, it was urged, Your Honor, that this decision in
■the court below is not in accord with Banks vs. Chicago Grain
Tglygpgyg or tta irgll va« QyHearn© crass, and this is th© ground
©a which th© petitioner's certiorari was filed.
X urge that this ruling is more in terms of th#
earlier decision® under Section 33(g) of the Longshoremen's
•sad Harbor Workers* Act» and that the interpretation placed ©a
if- ralraera thran by 'd

Sra’il-rac^ras raid Bell have? shown a desire to

craraoraraac;,-:: settlements, Your Honor.

a-a us©, as a practical matter

6

it's tart vary ensv vxs get. «m insurance carrier to agree to a
settlement of an aw^rd for an amount less than they've already
paid „
The two claims are not of equal footing, one being of
the nature of & non-fault insurance, which is really a first
kind of non-fault insurance? and many times in the better case,
especially if you have very poor liability, fco prove fault.
Q

Doesn't this case turn on whether the enterprise

that took place in the judge's chambers is the judicial
determination or the compromise settlement?

Isn’t that the

heart of the case?
HR. SMITH;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Is it part of your thesis that if a judge

suggests a figuro of settlement, assuming that he did so here,
that that takes .it out of the compromise area and makes it

into a judicial evaluation or judicial determination?
MR. SMITH:

Well, yes, in effect. Your Honor.

What

I am saying is that the Banks css© does state in its language
that it differed from these earlier cases .in the fact that it
was evaluated by a trial judge.
Kow, what I am stating is that in this particular
instance the trial judge had before him certain information,

perhaps not the information that you’d have from a fully
conduefe d trial, bub ha did have the pretrial statement, which

is avail-sbl-a in all those cases; he had a deposition that had

besom given by the plaintiff.

Ho had something to go on, on

which to evaluate this claim,

Q

iv’3

y-:m suggesting that he had enough to decide

the case?

ME. SMITEs

X think *— yes, Your Honor, I believe that

he could make a fair —
Q

Then why shouldn’t we have district judges dis­

pose of all cases without trial, just on the pretrial statement?
MR. SMITH: Well, I wouldn’.t go so far — 1 wouldn’t
go so far as that, Your Honor. Jill I’m saying is that I think
h© had as much information that is necessary to make a fair
evaluation of the claim, and that if somebody at a later data
wishes to challenge it, X think that they' should have an
ofolig?.eJ,t>n to shew that there was sea® prejudice to them from
this settlement.
i don’t think that we should presume conclusively
the fact that the judge .interceded in th© settlement that it’s
not a fair evaluation of the claim.
Q

Couldn’t either party reject it?

ME, SMITH?

Yes, Your Honor*

They could res jest it

and go to ferial.
Q

Wall, you don’t normally reject judgments, do you? -

You’re bound by them.

MR. SMITH a well, yes. Your Honor. But of course those
other two cases, as a matter of fact —

8
Q

So fcha remittitur

or the judge knew all the

fact*: .in th© case# h.:* sat through the whole trial in the case.
Mi l right?
MR. SMITHS Wall, yes, Your Honor, but no on© had to
accept the remit tit ire figure.
Q

But ha had all the facts, didn’t he?

MR. SMITHs
Q

He could have gone to trial.

Yes, Your Honor.

But this judge didn’t.

He had all the —
H© was just helping out,

wasn't he?
MR. SMITH; Well, I think, Mr. Justice Marshall, it
was a little more than just helping out.
q

X think that h© «*-

Well, what more?

MR. SMITHi

Well, he may not have had as many facts

m you would have-; at a trial under ideal conditions.

But I

tr^re’s many a trial that you would have just about as
much information m he had.
Well, suppose the judge had held the discussion

in th-.z library of the court, would that be .judicial?

I’m trying

to get what mileage you get out of "it was in his chambers”,
i don't get any mileage out of that at all.
Do you?
MR. SMITH; Well, I feel, Your Honor, that he did have
enough information before him where he could make an ©valuation
of it and enter into a consent judgment, which was don© in this
instance.

I think that in evary case of arbitration of a

9
settlement we te&vv

csas limitations as to the information that

& judge has, and X certainly can't com© forth and say that he
had as much information as he would have had with a fullfledged trial *
But X *r. not sure that a full-fledged trial is necessary
in all these instances to evaluate a claim,*

And X think that a

Juan who cal sc a district court judge has little greater ability
of measuring a vatm of a claim then 12 people, even when they
I

do h&ve ell fchv evid-snc®.

He has at least as much, from the

many years of experience that ha's had.
Q

Well, what you're saying add© up to the

proposition that when a judge, a ferial judge, gets into the
process of sottlemenfe which, up to now, I thought was something
to b© encouraged, he is making a judicial determination rather
than presiding over •. compromise or a settlement conference*
Isn't this —
i:ii. SK\X'’s
h:*art of v/hafc X

Yes, Your Honor, that's probably the

caving.

But insurer in these other cases,

You?; Hanor, have coma; up to what's known as a judicial
determination ?tad fcb-sn they settle for a figures something less.
I mean, a jury came in with a $30,000 award or a
remittitur of $19,000 award ~~
Q

Wall, X am talking about cases that go on every

day in every courthouse in the country.

To dispose of cases

without trial by having the parties come in to the judge's

xo
cfo'axishers and the l?:.ywars hav® discussions back and forth, and
they finally reach a settlement figure.
Sow, that’s a common practice, as you know, of course.
.

MR. SMITH: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
i

Q

ted it is certainly one to be encouraged, isn't

«

it?
HR. SMITH:

I certainly feel that way, Mr. Chief
« *
.

Justice, and that's why I feel vary strongly about this point,
Q

But your argument, though, is that that can foe

reopened, after both parties have agreed to it, and months ©r

years r-nos, one party can corns in and challenge the agreement,
iio fi^tAXausnt «y-reament, and bring on e new trial all over
again.
HE. SMI as*

No, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I

didn't mean to rcdafes anything of that natare,

X feel that

ones it was entered into and — as a matter of fact, in this
case, the judge went on the bench and had the parties accept
the figure and then .-signed a consent judgment for the amount,
which —
Q

Isn't that don® in fch® settlement of every

case?

xx.-u SMITH s 5Jc-.ll, not nsceassrily, Your Honor, somawl: wc -

.-.

■i-i-u:'■:■£, X suppose it would be? certainly close to

fch® sam© thing as a consent judgment.
Q

xi; X, suppose, in this instance, two lawyers

11
had sat den;i «-.ad written out: a compromise agreement,, and they
*

*

t

exchanged releasee, or whatever, without talcing consent judgment*
You wouldn't bj hern, would you?
MR* SMITHs

If -the two lawyers had done it alone,

Mr* Justice Brennan?
Q

Yes.

MR. SMITH %
Q

No , 1 think the —

la other words, it would have been a compromise

agreement*
MR. SMITHs
Q

Yes# Mr. Justice —»

Would you say this was not © compromise agreement

but# rather# it wan something that Judge Youngdahl suggested as
?:s cncvvat by which tie css® should fees disposed of, and it took

the form, then, of s consent judgment.

Is that it?

MR. SMITHS That is correct.

Q

And you say a consent, judgment is not a

compromise agreement for purposes of this statute.
MR. SMITHs That is correct# Mr. Justice Brennan.
Q

Well, how do you -- 2 guess we've all been

parties to these tilings, but sometimes it takes the form of &
defense judgment and some kind of exchange of releases.
what difference is there between the two?
MR. SMITH $
could be reopened.
o

Really#

Actually?

Well, 2 don’t think @ consent judgment
I would ~—

No# no# I*ra not suggesting that.

No.

The issue

12
hera is whetfcsc?

was a compromise for the purposes of the

statute, isn't that, it?
And it just didn't take the form of an agreement
between counsel, of a sort that we're familiar with, where
they exchange leases &ad that sort of thing»
MR. SMITHs

That is correct.

It was a settlement,

but I think that most all these cases, Mr. Justice Brennan,
are really settlement#.

All the Mew York cases cited by my

opposing counsel involve settlements.
Q

A compromise in the real sense.

MR. SMITH;
Q

Yes, but —

Hero, is this the way this thing is done in the

Idsor’at, itt you rater consent judgments in these things
instead of settlement agreements?

I/O. SMXTHs

Ordinarily it would be an express

agreement, Mr. Justice Brennan, signed by both parties, saying
that the se-tfcloment is dismissed, and usually they don’t even
put the figure dawn,
Q

Yes.

MR. SMITH?

Yes.
In this case w© did have a person that,

had © history of mental illness, and, sis a matter of fact, this
was one of the reasons that Judge Youngdahl wanted a «~

Q

Well, I —

MR. SMITHs

it was- a necessity because of the
tixe case, and the judgment was more

protection.
Wow, i« that what this situation was?
MR. SMITH? Basically, yes,
Q

Well, I must say I never regarded those infant

settlements as any less compromises or settlements because we
had to take this form to enter them.
MR* SMITH?

Well, I think this word "compromise” has

been rather --"settlements" has been rather abused in the
interpretations und«r this Act, both in New York and here,
bacaua© what I nov&r could understand on these other decisions,
taey'u r^ach a judicial valuation by a judgment and then they

would u:~ctl€i it fox ■■% lesser figure.
tali, ih'-r i wa.B no way the insurance carrier was
going to recoup what he had lost.

by the other side, in

And one of the cases cited

York, involved a settlement of

¥45,000 anc the other party wouldn't — the insurance carrier
wouldnrt s.ign a consent

no, the other side- said they ware

going to appeal unless they took $600 off the judgment.

On a

$45,000 judgment, dropping it $000 seems very strange, and
yet the insurance carrier wouldn't consent, although it was
found to toe a judicial valuation? they felt that they hadn't

been prejudiced by accepting the lesser amount.
Q

As Justice Marshall suggested» that’s the case

•.;.t.ara all the facta sra in, the case has been completely tried,
IS. SMITHs Well, X agree with that,. Your Honor, but

Q

Who took the initiative for the meetings in

MR. SMITHi
Stewart-.

Judge Youngdah1 did. Mr. Justice

He called us into the chambers and h© has quite a

reputation in thj Dir trict of Columbia for encouraging settle­
ments .
[.Laughter. ]
And ha was quite forceful# I will say.
Q

He did take the initiative.

And so —

MR. SMITHs Very definitely.
Q

— at least there is that significant distinc­

tion between -the circumstances here and a settlement worked
out by counsel with no participation by a judge at ail, because
there the initiative has to com© from one of the lawyers or
tha ©thsi-r, and bar-, the initiative cam® from the judge.

Is that

right?
MR. SMITris
Q

Yes.

Anci ha had before him, he had the pleadings and

ha hc.d a deposition of the plaintiff, and he had a schedule
of th© special damages, is that right?
MR. SMITH:

Yes.

That was in the pretrial statement,

18
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. GREGG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GREGGs

Mr. Chi®f justice, and may it pleas© the

Court:
The question, I think, is adequately phrased„

With

respect to what transpired in Judge Youngdahl*3 chambers, the
only evidence on that point that is in the record is contained
in the testimony of Mr. Mahoney, who was the lawyer representing
the defendant in fch® third-party action.

His testimony starts

on page 31 of the transcript of proceedings, and, as he said,
on page 32, with respect to the conference before Judge
Youngit'-hli' “iis 2 rtcali, it was done in his usual manner.
That 3

- v

discus mil the settlement with both of us first and

then, X believe, 2 left the room, the settlement was discussed
with you, meaning counsel, and then I was called back in and
you left the room and our figures were discussed then.
As a result of the conference, an agreement was reached at
$5,000."
This is the testimony of Mr. Mahoney, a witness
offered by counsel for the petitioner during the workmen'a
compensation proceeding,
Mr. Mahoney wars further examined with respect to the
question n^'to -/by it vms that a consent judgment was entered
iu fbc-i-nr
just, filing

hhvioI

procedure of

precipe. s-ntsring the case as settled and dismissed.

19
I was Questioning him.about that, and I said:

"You've

had several casos com© up for ferial before Judge Youngdahl,
have you not? *
He said, "Yes, sir."
"And there war© of course occasions whan a consent
judgment was entered into as a result of a conference in chambers'
"Answers
"Question:

That's correct.
Primarily where the plaintiff is an

infant?81
He nods his head yes.
"Question*

otherwise, generally speaking, a precipe

is merely filed, entering the case as settled and dismissed
with prejudice?

- --

"That's true,
"Question:

Was there any discussion between the

plaintiff's .lawyer and the judge that this consent judgment
was necessary in order to eliminate the workmen’s compensation
carrier’s interest in the case or to provide a means of
avoiding the settlement provisions undor workman's compensation
Act? *
According to Mr. Mahonay, the answer was no.
"Question: Then why was it that with an adult
plaintiff a consent judgment was entered into in this case
when there had bes-a no real trial on the merits?
"Answers

For the protection of all concerned, it wms

20
felt th&t this consent judgment should be entered into.
"Question?

For the protection meaning the protection

against fcht; reifications of the Workmen's Compensation Act?
"Answer:

Mo,

All concerned.,, which would he the

plaintiff and the attorneys involved."
Mr. McClanahan had had several lawyers and had been
under psychiatric care.
“Question:

You are implying then that perhaps Mr.

McClanahan would not have abided by the settlement without a
consent judgment?
"No, air* I don't imply that.
"Question: But there was no ferial on the merits?
“Answer:
"Question:

No trial on the merits.
Mo testimony was offered?

BThat8 s correct.
“No jury was empaneled?
“That's correct.
"No verdict was rendered."
So the question here is whether a discussion of this
nature in the conference of a judge prior to the start of a
trial constitutes, us the Court has indicated, a judicial
©valuation of tfco case as distinguished from a settlement, a
judgment that merely affirms and ratifies a settlement that
had previously been entered into between the parties.
This is not & particularly novel question,

in Bell

21
vs. 08Hat.xn® they cite MarIinovs. _Card!Ilo? and I am quoting?
"The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
held zh&t. & settlement between a claimant and a third party
©ntrored into without the consent and agreement of the employer
c.,: the insurance carrier followed by the entry of a judgment
in the (agreed amount, barred the claimant from recovering any
deficiency benefits under the Act.
"The Marlin casse is likewise distinguishable from the
instance case, Bell vs. O'He&raa, for there the settlement of
the plaintiff’s claim was reached before the court had
established the ©mount of the third party’s liability and
reduced it to judgment.”
In Boll v.s. 0 sEsarne, the Court in the Fourth Circuit
said, page 780 of 284 Fed 2d;

"As we construe the statute,"

the specific provision of the Longshoremen's Act that

Wvit’rs dealing with i..sre, "a .recovery of deficiency compensation
is hi-:?:- ‘U only where the injured employee or his beneficiarias

in r

rf death have compromised the third party claim or

whers -s judgment in th© third party action has teen entered
as a result of a settlement or a compromise.81
The uncontradicted evidence in this case before the
Commission and upon which both the trial court and the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia acted,
was that this was a. settlement that was entered into and that
the judgment in thio case was entered into merely and solely

for fiie purpose of confirming' the settlement fchst the parties
had previously reached.
Q

Well, you do have this statement that the

$5,009 figure was. Judge Youngdahl’s determination.
at p?*ge 32 of the Appendix.

I'm looking

The witness says, wl don't know

wheth&r I was asked what I evaluated the case at., but X know

at

rloo dvr lag the discussion Judge Yonngdahl felt that

-i:-. c*.o© wes worth $5,000»"

And that was the amount of the

consent judgmant?
MR. GREGG:
Q

Yes, sir•

So there vma that much.indication.

MR. GREGGs

Yes, sir.

In other wordsf it's not as

Q

So there was a determination of & valuation, at

least, by a man who is a United States district judge?
MR. GREGGs

Yes, sir.,

In other words, in this case

it’;* not as clearly one way or the other, as some cases are.
Br.. if cccld aessi to ir.a that when a judge is evaluating a
case for settlement purposes, h© is considering a lot of
v

he’s net considering as a trier of the fact.

He’s

considering the odds cf recovery, jury verdict ranges, and
matters of that nature.
It is purely and simply a compromise that’s the only
real way that we can dispose of the case without having
additional proceedings follow, motion©, appeals, and s© forth.

23
Now the Banks ya«,_ Chicago Grain Tgfeeer^ Association case,
which is th® most recent opinion of this Court dealing with this
subject, involved, as Justice Marshall indicated, a case -that
had gone to trial, the evidence had been offered and introduced,
and it involved the question as to whether an order of
remittitur constituted a judicial determination.

It hardly

seems worth mentioning that an order of remittitur would be a
judicial determination made by a trier based upon facts,
testimony,and evidence that was before it.
W© submit to the Your Honors that, the case that we
have her® is distinguishable, and we rely primarily upon the
reasoning employed by the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia.

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN LOUIS SMITH, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, there’s one thing that I

vjnnfcei to mantica when I was standing before and I forgot was
that yesterday when I was researching these New York cases,
cited by Mr, Gregg, I checked the New York statute, and 3: noticed
that they5v@ changed their statute, and I felt the Court should
be aware of this, because, really, it's in McKinney's
Consolidated Laws of New York, 64 Workmen's. Compensation Law,

24
Section 1549, the Pocket similar language in their compromise statement, and than they
added onto its

However, written approval of the carrier need

not be obtained if the employee or his dependents obtain a
compromise order from a justice of the court, in which the
third party action was pending.

Th© papers upon an application

to compromise and settle such a claim shall consist of the
petition, the affidavit of the attorney, and the affidavit of
a physician -or moro — more than on® physician if necessary.
hncl it spells out basically what should b© in this
information, and really did not provide an awful lot more
information that was available in this cas© to Judge Youngdahl.
Then copies of tills, or whan a judge arrives at a
determination, copies of this are served on the» carrier end if
th© carrier feels as if that's not enough, then they can com©
in and challenge it, because they have to produce evidence
that it’s not st fair settlement.
tod X believe that this was dene in Mew York by the
Legislature there to encourage settlements and discourage
this idea ©f & party who's really not a party t© frustrating

settlements.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Thank you, Mr. Smith.

Ths-.nk you, Mr. Gregg.

Th© case is submitted.
