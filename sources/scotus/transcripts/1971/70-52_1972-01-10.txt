MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

next in Np, 52, United States against Mississippi Chemical
Corporation.
Mr o "inn,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. ZINN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. 2INN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
This federal income tax case is here on writ of
certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

It

raises the question whether farmer cooperative associations,
like the respondents, which are required to purchase the Class
C stock of the New Orleans Bank for Cooperatives as a condition
to borrowing from, the bank, may deduct the cost of such stock
•us interest expense or as an ordinary and necessary business
expense.
The New Orleans Bank for Cooperatives is one of
twelve regional bunks which, together with the Central Bank
here in Washington, were created by Congress in 1933 to
furnish credit to farmer cooperativos at the lowest possible
cost.
The Bank’s original capital was furnished by the
United Stater, but under a congressional plan embodied in the
Farm C: edit Act of 1955, the government capital was to he

4
replaced gradually by capital belonging to member borrowers
which would purchase Class C stock,
The ultimate goal of the statute was complete
borrower ownership of the banks.
The Bank's authorised capital consists of three
classes of stock. A, 8, and C, each with a par value of $100 a
share.

Class A stock represents the government's initial

contribution to capital, is non-voting, pays no dividends» and
is to ba retired at par with the retirement proceeds coming
from borrower contributions to capital and the Bank's earnings.
Class B stock is intended for sale to the public.

It

is issued at par, is ncn-vofcing, and may pay a non-cumulative
dividend not to exceed 4 percent a year.

After all Class A

stock has been retired, Class B stock may then be retired at
par.

The oldest Class S stock to be retired first.
Class C stock is the voting common stock of the

banks, it may normally be issued only to farmer cooperatives
at its par value of $.100 a share.
acquire Class C stock in four ways:

Parmer cooperatives may
first, each must purchase

at least one share of Class C stock to be eligible to borrow
from the bank.

Each of the respondents purchased the so-called

qualifying share and capitalized its cost.

The capitalization

treatment of the rale qualifying share is not here in. dispute.
Second, each borrower must invest quarterly in
Cias;., c stock,, an amount equal to at least 10 but not more than

Z5 pereant of the interest it pays to the bank on it3 loan
during tl- . calendar quarter.

The percentage of the New Orleans

Bank during the years here in issue was 15 percent*

It is the

proper treatment of the cost of the Class C stock purchased
under the 15 percent requirement that is here in dispute*
The respondents contend that they may deduct, in
addition to the stated interest on their loans, the cost of
Class C stock in excess of a nominal value of & dollar a share.
They contend that this is deductible as interest or as ordinary
and necessary business expense.
Q

This is the stock that pays no dividends?

Right?
MR» ZINM:

It pays no dividends, that's right, Mr*

Justice G

Actually, there is no stock certificate, is that

it?
MR. SIMM:
Q

That's correct, Mr. Justice.

It's just a bookkeeping, is it,~~

MR. SIMMs
Q

That's right, Mr. Justice.

— transaction?

MR. 2INN;

Tire situation is much the same as it was

in the Lincoln Savings case, where there were no stock
certificates.
C

And this is a — it's not a tr&nsferrable

interest, of any kind?

6
MR, SINK';
Q

Yes o

MR, ZIHNs
Q

Just like in the Lincoln Savings case, •—

—~ it*s precisely chat,

Jo transfer»

But the Class C stock pays dividends?

MR. SINK;

Yes, it does.

Cur position, Mr. Justice,

is, however, that even though there is no,stated return on this
stock, that the farmer cooperatives do indeed earn a return in
chat they have a right to share in the profits of the year in
which they purchase stock.
Q

How do they share in that?

Is that simply by an

increment of the bookkeeping?
MR. SINft: Well, in the first instance, that's the
third way in which they acquire stock, Mr. Justice Brennan.
At the end of each year each farmer cooperative gets what is
c&lled a patronage refund, and it’s initially issued in the
form of Class C stock.

The patronage refund stock is

distributed to farmer cooperatives in the proportion that the
interest paid by each cooperative there —
Q

Mow, you say distributed --

MR. SINN;
Q

How do you mean?

MR. SINN;
Q

Yes, sir.
How is that dona?

It's allocated on the books.

I see.

JR. SINK?

That’s the same situation as it was in

f:f;coln, where the credits to the secondary reserve —

?
O

How doss the farmer cooperative ever realise on

this bookkeeping item?
ME, ?,IHN:

The way it realises it, perhaps I could

refer the Court to the graph on page 163 of the record, it
shows a revolving wheel, and the farmer cooperative puts in its
dollars at the top of that wheel, and gradually, as subsequent
borrowers make investments in Class C stock, after the
governmentca capital has been retired completely and the Class
I; stock has been retired completely, the Class C stock, whether
purchased or issued as a patronage refund, is revolved out on
the cooperative principle of retiring first the oldest
contribution.
Now, to give you some idea of what's .involved here,
Mr. Justice Brennan, let me refer you to page 8 of our opening
brief.

Thara are several in this case.

We set out there a

figure for the Class C stock purchase, the patronage dividends,
and the allocated surplus credits received by each farmer
cooperative here, each of•the respondent cooperatives.
Now, let's just take Mississippi Chemical for 1961.
They paid in $18,940 and change for Class C stock.

Now, that

rc tvoy presxr.'.ably was used to retire Class A stock or Class B
stock or earlier issued Class C stock.

And the same — now,

they received the patronage dividend in the form of the Class C
.• ck bookkeeping entry of $27,000, and they also received an
allocated surplus credit of soma $12,000.

a
How, the way this thing works is that at some future
time? after, enough later people have purchased Class C stock?
they"re going to get back not only the 19?000 that they came
up with at the outset, but the total of those three numbers in
that line, which is just under $59,000? -Q

And they get that back in cash?

MR. SXHNs

Yes, cash in hand, at an indefinite future

tine,
I * vs already referred to —
Q

But that's all, that's the absolute ceiling,

isn5 fc it,
MR. SINN:
Q

Yes, it is.

it's only for that year?

MR. SINN:

That’s right? Mr. Justice.

But we see no

reason why an ordinary corporation couldn’t? instead of allowing
stock to share in the profits of a corporation for all years,
which is the way it works in an ordinary corporation —
o

You say you get the profits of the corporation *—

you show the profits of the corporation —
L-'Rc 3INN:
Q

For this year.

— in the year you bought the shares?

MR, SINN: Right.
n

That’s what it comes down to.

MR. 2ISN: Ana it's proportional.
it ectv&s

iAC-m-i

That’s exactly what

to, and it’s proportional to the stock purchased

9

in that .year because of the cooperative mechanism, the statute
does provide for an allocation in terms of-the interest paid
by each cooperative to the interest paid by all.,
is purchased in the same proportion.

But the stock

And respondents' contention

is that this — that we shouldn’t decide this case by reference
to cooperative principles, because it’s perfectly clear that
this is the provision of capital for the bank.

And if that

were recognised, this would be a non-deductible capital contri­
bution .
And what we are saying is simply this:

that if they

don't want fcba case decided on the basis of cooperative
principles, under which we clearly prevail, when we look at the
substance of the thing, the substance is that you're sharing
in the bank's profits for that year.
Q

And if you use the — and if you borrow money

every year you would share in tha profits every year?
MR.
Q

zinns

Exactly.

What's the impact of this on the cost of ranting

or borrowing the money?
MR. 2INK!; Well, Mr. Justice, under the statute — and
I'll refer the Court to the first page of Appendix B to cur
brief
Q

Of your x.ain brief?

MRt ZIHWj
c

page 47.

Of our opening brief, I'm sorry.

That's

During the years here in issue, the statutory

10

limit for stated interest was 6 percent.
Now,
Q

I'm not sure 1 follow yon.

MR, SINNj

Six percent?

Six percent stated interest was the most

that any bank could charge.

Now, if yon have to pay — come

up with 15 percent of that in a — to purchase Class C stock,
that would raise the --- 15 .percent of 6 percent is nine-tenths
of one percent, so that, would be the affective rate.
Does that answer your question, Mr, Chief Justice?
Q

Well, 1 think so.

I think so.

You were about

to supplement your answer to Justice White, I think, when 1
put my question,
MR. 3INNs

Yes, I was about to say, when you say if

you borrow every year, so long as your borrowing is outstanding,
Mr, Justice, you don't have to make a new loan each year, you
have to pay 15 percent of the interest each year —
Q

I understand.

MR. ZXNN:
Q

In any year that you are borrowing money

MR. 2DJK:
Q

—• of the prior loan.

Right.

You share in the profits.

— as long as you pay an override on your

interest, and you get an underride back?
MR. 3INN: Well, we con * t use those terms, because we
don't find them in the legislative history.
e-,

The respondents

Tie ■ ■ ■; is.Votive history refers to those as investments.

11
Q

!?€•’£> o

MR, SINN;

A:od patronage refunds, and we'll stick

with those, statutory terms.
Q

All right.

MS. 2XNN: The position ofthe respondents here is that

all they got was the right to receive the money they paid in at
some indefinite future time.

Now, we think we!ve already

shown that they got more than that, that they got the right to
receive that money back in cash, and also got the right to

receive the profits of the year in which they made the purchase.
But. our position here doesn’t turn on whether there’s
& return or not.
la the last brief which we filed in October, we

rtttemptcd to respond to the respondents’ contention that there
exists a universal principle that if, as a condition to a loan,
a borrower is required to purchase an asset at more than its
fair market value, the excess is deductible interest.
We attempted to dispute the assertion of that
<

universal principle by putting the hypothetical of a case in

thlah ci borrower goes to a commercial bank and asks to borrow
if.; ,000 for tea years, and the bank says, "Very well, we'll
Zoaci you

$.

10,000 for ten years at a. stated interest rate of

j per-rent; but as a condition to that loan we’re going to ask

you to keep cm hand, in a non-interest-bearing checking account,
$1,000 during the terra of the loan.”

12
We say in thz.t case that only $800 is deductible
interest«
Now, the fair market value of that compensating
balance may be zero.

It may be that there is no market for

restricted compensating balances, nonetheless, we say that
it's clear that you can’t deduct the whole thousand dollars,
because you still own it.

'The present value of the $1,000

compensating balance, that is the right to receive $1,000 in
ten years, we assume to be $650.
nevertheless, we urge that the $350 difference is not
deductible interest, it’s simply interest that they might have
earned but didn’t earn, and they might have earned it had they
been free to invest the thousand dollars at the going rate of
interest for the ten-year period rather than in a non-interestbearing checking account.
For this latter proposition we relied on this Court’s
decision 30 years ago in
Court hel

Hort v. Commissioner, in which the

it no deduction is-allowable for income that might

have been but was not earned.
In the paper which respondents filed last week, they
now concede -chat only $800 is deductible interest in that
hypothetical*

Under their analysis, the borrower in the

hypothetical really borrowed only $9,000, and so they say the
propositior: which they originally asserted that whenever a
borrower is i.squired to purchase an asset at more than its

13
fair market value, the excess is deductible interest and remains
intact.
We disagree, and we submit that by conceding the
hypothetical respondents have conceded this case.
Let me put a second hypothetical to the Court»
Instead of having to pay in to the checking account $1,000 at
the outsat, the borrower has to pay in only $100 at the outset,
.but on each succeeding anniversary of the loan must also pay in
$100.

Under respondents5 analysis the amount of the outstanding

loan during the first year would ba $9900, the amount during
the second year would be $9800, the amount during the third
year would ba $9700, and so on.

So that in the tenth year the

amount outstanding on the loan would be $9,000»
The average balance over the ten-year period would be
$S,450.

Nonetheless, no more than $800 would be deductible

as interest in any of those year».

If a thousand dollars, placed at the outset, is not
deductible, as respondents now concede, a fortiori a hundred
dollars placed each year is not deductible.
It is no more fictional to say in this second
hypothetical that the amount of the outstanding loan was
reduced gradually to $9,000 than it is to say that the amount
af the lot.’.', is reduced gradually, or reduced in the first
instance to $9,000 in the hypothetical put in our reply brief.
In neither of those casca? in this case.

But let me move the matter somewhat closer to home.
Take the same facts as in the second hypothetical, except that
instead of being

•/aired to keep the compensating balance on

hand for only the term of the loan, ten years, the borrower has
tc keep the compensating balance on hand for 13 years .

Under

respondents5 analysis, the borrower has borrowed $9,000 for
ten years, or'$9450 in the periodic payment case, and has had
to leave on deposit for three additional years, in a non-inters
bearing checking account, $1,000.
The llorf

case tells us that the interest that they

might have earned on that checking account, had it been
invested at the going rate of interest instead of in a noninterest-bearing account is hot deductible.
Finally, let me move to the last hypothetical, which
I think approximates this case.
It'c the same as the facts in the third hypothetical,
except that instead of the banks agreeing to release the
compensating balance at the end of 13 years, the release is to
he made at

indefinite future time.
This, in effect, is the situation in the instant

case on the respondents* assumption, which we do not agree
with, that purchased Class-C stock earns no return and that it
.i-.o'- roo other vaiy.e to respondents.

In other words, that it

gives the respondents only the right to get their money back
at. acme indefinite future time.

15
Now, hero, just as in the third hypothetical, what
the borrower hac foregone is simply the interest income it
might have earned from the end of the tenth year until the
indefinite future aims that it will receive its monev back.

No, it's in the discretion of the

discretion of the banks.
But, nonetheless, at some future time it will come

I think what you*re referring to, Mr. Justice, the
respondents intimate that the bank may never retire the Class
C stock, so they will never get their money back.

And it is

true that there is discretion here as to the exact time in the
Class C *””
Q

The question is really as to when.

MR. 8INK! That's right, as to when.

And really, in

this ease, that argument is wholly unfitting, because, after
all, we’re talking about instrumentalities of the United
States, and the only way they can achieve the purpose that
Congress has put forth hare is to allow farmer cooperativas to
own the bank entirely, and to allow those who borrow from a
cooperative bank to own it.

And these purposes can only be

achieved if the Class C stock la rolled over, and they will not
be achieved if<the Class C stock is never redeemed.
Furthermore, we're talking about a situation where
the 13 people who are ca'the Federal Farm Credit Board are
vary ;.:espcu3ibl3 official®; 12 are appointed by the President
of vlv;; United States, with the. advice and consent of the Senate.

17
They are nominated by the farmers and the farmer
cooperatives themselves.

The 13th member of the Federal Farm

Cted.it Board is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture *
Now, as far as the boards of directors of these
individual banks, six of them, six. out of the seven are
electad by farmers and farmer cooperatives; the seventh is
appointed by the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration.
We agree that there's discretion as to timing, but
we say that -there’s little doubt here that the stock eventually
will be redeemed, and that even on respondents’ assumption
that they are only getting the right to gat their money back,
there is no deduction based on the four hypothetical» that I
have put to the Court.
Hr. Chief Justice, I should like to reserve my
remaining tirae for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well.
Mr„ Satterf1eld.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. SATTERFIELD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. SATTERFIELD;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courtt

In this case we have a very basic difference of
opinion with the. government in its position.

In order for the government to prevail, as has been
indicated by counsel, they-must establish that this proposition

18
v:hich appear;': on page 11 of their brief as being a statement
o,: their position in the case, neither the fact that respondents
are required to invest in Class C stock in connection with their
loans s nor: the limitation on the transferability of the stock,
could convert his cost into a deductible expense if it otherwise
would qualify as an income-producing asset providing benefits
in future years.
Our position is, as I will, 1 believe, demonstrate,
that this is not m income-producing ascot, that in fact it
has only nominal value, or, as the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals held, while it is not worthless — using the words of
that court — it was without an appreciable market value and
had only a nominal value„
As said again by that court, Class C stock shares
wore of no appreciable value co the taxpayer? as that court
said, these Class C shares had no fair market value and no
more than a nominal value, and no value to the taxpayers "in
the usual sense".
Now, reference has bean made by counsel, both in the
brief and in argument, taking the position that the patronage
refund credited upon the books as Class C stock and allocated
surplus» credited upon the books as Class C stock were credited
upon and carnati by the amount paid as interest override or for
purchase, so-called, of Class C stock.
Hov, a3 a matter of fact, that is wholly without any

19
foundation in thv statute , in the regulations, in the law, or
in fact.
The statute provides, in Section 1134(g) , all
patronage refund shall be paid in proportion, the amount of
interest earned on the loans of each borrower bears to the
total interest earned on the loans of all borrowers during fell
year.
It has no relationship to the three entries; made at
the end of the year, called Class C stock, to wit:

one entry

being the amount paid as interest override under Class C stock
column; another entry under patronage refund as Class C stock
in the column; another entry as allocated surplus under Class
C stock column.
Ane the regulations, 70 Part 1162, which appear on
page 55 of the; brisf, as an Appendix, of the government:
Allocations shall be made, in what?

They are wholly unrelated

to this interest override itself. Allocations shall be made
in proportion that the amount of interest accrued on the loans
of each borrower bears to the total interest accrued on the
leans of all borrowers during the fiscal, year, and shall be
recorded as allocations'at the end of the fiscal year.
It is impossible to conclude that the interest made
as patronage refunds, allocations of surplus are returns upon
the interest made at the end of the year of the interest
override amount under so-called Class C stock.

20
Left's taka an illustration as to what this really
hv sans

la Clar- ■ C stock earned either in that year or in

subsequent years any income?
Cooperativa h has accumulated $150,000 in par or
face value of Class C stock.
Cooperative B has just come in and bought one
qualifying share or Class C stock, on the basis of $100,
Each borrows from the New Orleans Bank for Cooperative:
that year the name amount of money? their loans are an
ident1cal amount.
«Che cooperative with $150,000 in par value of Class
C stock, fthc cooperative with the $100 per value of Class C
stock

receive the identical amount of patronage refunds, the

identical amount of allocated surplus,

The same being related

not to Class C stock or to interest override? it is related to
tha interest paid upon the loan for the year.
That is true both as to the first year ans as to
every subsequent year.

So that as & matter of fact it is

impossible that this can b® attributed to it.
Now? this has been recognized by the government.
this case? actually in the MPA case? .and in other cases.

In
In

this case there was included? iby. the District Court? an
attempt to recover patronage refunds,

. The basis being that

the patronage .refunds had a value which was a taxable value
at the banis of $100 psr share.

2.1

The District Court held against the government on
that.

In th® Court of Appeals the government abandoned that

petition, did not appeal from the District Court to the Court
of Appeals,, has not appealed to this Court.
In the MPA case from the Eighth Circuit, it wasn't
even involved in the District Court, although in one of the
briefs it ras indicated that it might have been involved.

But

at the Court of Appeals level it was not urged and now, on the
petition for writ of certiorari now pending, it is hot urged.
Arid why in that?
Mow, mind you, this is all the same Class C stock,
no differential from one Class C to another Class, all entries
as Mr. Justices White indicated, on the books.
Nov; t why is it that we are not asked to pay tax on
the Class C stock in the second column, under the heading
Patronage Refunds, which may become Class C stock under the
heading Allocated Surplus, but. only those entries made at the

seme time at the end of the year under the first column, Class
C stock said to be resulting from the payment of interest
override.
Here * s the reason s

In Long and in Carpenter it was

held by the Fifth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit, and. in
T?:jsasury Regulation 1S2-5-B-123 and 124, the IBS has taken
the position that where this type of certificate or stock is
:rcand Ik received as patronage refund., the market value

22
shall ha taxed to the patron at the time of the receipt,

And,

quoting the regulation — this is taken also from those two
decisions — quote, "However, for the purpose of this sub­
er- vis ion, any -document which is payable only in the discretion
of a cooperative association shall be considered not to have
any fair market value unless it is clearly established to the
contrary«
Therefore, this Class C stock, whether it be in one,
two, ox* third column, does not. have market value - "unless it is
clearly established to the contrary”.

And this record, as

v-rve shown in our briefs, as was found by the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals, as was found by the District Court, not only
was not clearly shown to have value or market value, it was
clearly shown to have only a nominal value,
That is a matter of discretion.

This illustration of

the compensating balance is wholly inapplicable.

If there's a

compensating balance, it is repayable when the loan la repaid,
it is kept there while the loan is there’, it's — the check is
money•

What effect does if have?

As we pointed out in our supplemental brief, if it's
a 110,000 deal you have a compensating balance of $1,000, you
«imply borrow $9,000.

So instead of paying 8 percent, yon pay

0,9 percent. But the number of dollars is the same.

You're

paying $810 interest cm a $10,000 loan, but you deposit $1,000,
bo actually you get 9,000 bucks,

23
Hence you are paying 8.9 percent, and you have a
deduction for the full $800 paid, and you don't ask for or
receive any acre.

But,that's your money, it comes back to you,

and you receive it.
How, here, if or when or how, under what circumstance
Crass C stock may be revolved, it's within the discretion of
three bodies:

the bank itself in its recommendation to the

regional Farm Credit Administration; the Regional Farm Credit
Administration5s recommendation to the Farm Credit Administra­
tion in Washington.

All three discretions have to be exercised

in order for it to be repaid.
How, not only.that, but there have been some
inadvertent errors or omissions in the brief, which has been

lb.led by the government in this case.

I think perhaps in

receiving advice from the Farm Credit Administration by
telephone, they just hung up the telephone too soon.
For instance,

there's a statement made — it's not

in the record, no evidence to this effect whatsoever in the
record? it5a not before the Court, it's inadmissible, and

vis repaid by the revolving of C stock, and running from C
stock.

The fact is; the Hew Orleans Bank for Cooperatives

borrowed several millions of dollars under market in order to
pay it off, and now the effect of it, rather than hastening
the repayment of C stock as a financial matter, it means it will

bi a longer period of time before the C stock can be revolved,
because they9 re paying a higher interest on the money they

borrowed to pay off the A stock than they were paying returns
to the government on the A stock.
Now, it is a fact that by borrowing that money and
burdening themselves by that additional interest, and burdening
themselves with taxes that are no longer exempt, they have
reduced their financial ability to repay C stock, but they
have removed the legal inhibition which existed because they
couldn't revolve C stock as long as A was outstanding.

But ‘that is a situation which has not improved the
possibility of a revolving of the C stock.
In addition to that there, I mention only in passing
another time in which apparently the phone was hung up too
soon, where in Note No. 16 ~~ no, this other nota, I’m sorry,

J&& on pugs lo

This is the note on page 21.

Some reference is made to the possibility that if
this Court holds this to be taxable income, there might be
$100 million less lending 'power for the, Banks for Cooperatives,
I say that they hung up the phone too soon, because, as a

matter of fast

it should occur there on the other side of

the coin, that the banks — it should be held this is interest
income to the. bank, then under the statute having additional
ir. rarest income or margins, the statute requires that that be
paid to their patrons.

It is not taxable income.

St increases

the amount of patronage refund, which is deductible from the
bank and from their taxable sources.
In addition to that, depending on the discretion of
tfc.s bank, and they have full discretion, it wouldn’t affect
their lending power in any way if they, in their discretion,
simply said, "We'11 simply delay the revolving of earlier C
stock because we have a million dollars less or SCO thousand
dollars less since this went out in patronage as additional
margin."
Therefore, there would be no burden whatever upon
the banks if that occurred.
How, may I point out to the Court a few things, for
instance, in connection with this Lincoln case.
Q

Before you get to that, Mr. Satterfield, I'd

like to have your comment on an analogy that Mr. Zinn suggested.
I think he pointed out that, as he saw it, this situation was
vary much ilka a borrower going to a bank to borrow $10,000, if
I followed his hypothetical correctly, and the bank said, !’Yes,
we'll lend you the 1C,COO at 6 parcent or whatever, provided
you leave $1,000 at all times in a non-interest-bearing

26
checking account."
How, is he unduly oversimplifying this transaction
when ha puts that analogy to it?
KT-u SATTERFIELD:

May it please the Court, the answer

is yes.
In that instance, the $1,000 is placed in the account;
the actual $1,000 is repayable when the loan is repaid.

It is

true that the borrower receives 9,000, rather a net of 9,000
rather a net of 10,000 as the loan.

The only result is he

is paying a higher rate of interest, because if he pays 8 per­
cent on 10,000, that amounts to 8,9 percent on 9,000.
And there there is no similarity with this situation
at all, because■it is the money of the borrower, it is repayable
not in possible discretion depending on, as I have listed in
the brief, 11 contingenices that may or may not happen.

But

if is funds, it is money there belonging to the borrower.
Therefore, there's no parallel to this case whatsoever.
It is simply, in that case, you see, not that there is a lack
by the taxpayer of claiming what he might have earned by the
use of the thousand dollars; he is simply required to pay a
higher rate of interest, because he gets a $9,000 loan and
ho5s paying 8.3 percent interest by paying the same interest
that he would have contracted for on the 10,000,
In other words, $800 a year is what he pays on
the f10,000 loan at 0 percent.

If he pays $800 a year on the

$3,000 loan, he pays 8„9 percent.
deduct the full $800,

And he has a right to

He doesn't deduct more, he doesn’t

deduct less; he deducts what, he pays,
Q

But you would concede he isn't entitled to

deduct the thousand dollars, and the reason is, I suppose,
that the thousand dollars retains its value as a. thousand
dollars»
MR. SATTERFIELDs
Q

Well, now —

And you're saying in your case the money it

costs you to buy Class C stock ends upon in a certificate that
you say has no market value at all,
MR. SATTERFIELD: Right.

Has no value, it has only a

nominal value.
Q

Yet the thousand-doliar compensating account

remains a value of a thousand dollars.
MR. SATTERFIELD: Right.

And it remains that during

Contingencies as to possible repayment in

28.1 years, as the evidence showed in this case, or 31 years
in the Penn Yan case, or some other indefinite period of years,
does hot exist.

It’s his money.

Lika in Lincoln, for instance.

Now, in Lincoln, as

fcfco Court will remember, there was a secondary reserve.
this

Now,

-cone:ary reserve in Lincoln, the money was deposited.
Now, under the statute there, there was a mandatory

provision, an the Const said in discussing the effect, three
instances in vfhich the party would get the money back and
was required to be paid the money back by the statute*
Said this Court in that case:

The prospective refund,

and in case, at that, of the institution of pro rata share upon
termin&tion of its insured status, one; or upon receivership
or liquidation; or when the primary reserve of the loan reaches
suspension level.

It was required to be made by the statute.

In other words, if the primary reserve got big
enough, the guy got back what he put in the secondary reserve,
And in addition to that, in that statute — now
there was income-producing, as a matter of fact, because the
statute required that the home loan,or the insurance company,
FLIC, pay interest upon the secondary reserve amounts in the
identical percentage that they received from their obligations
held by them with the United States Government or guaranteed
by the United States Government.
And in the brief filed by the government in that
case it was said without dispute that as a matter of fact,
in the time involved in this particular case, that there was
earned from 3.15 to 4.23 percent annually upon the secondary
reserve.

That was always there.

It was mandated to be returned

under any and all circumstances which might occur.
Wiwra&s in this.case, this credit entered upon the
books is one as to which the funds may or may not be repaid.

29
There's quite a difference between a legal right to
receive back a deposit in cash with interest, guaranteed by
the statute, or a .eight to receive back a common savings
deposit with, the bank, with or without interest; as compared
to a situation in which we have this.
How , what is this interest override?
itself is clear.

The statute

The statute says, in 26 USC 1134(d)

— now,

it uses the words that the borrower shall be required to invest
quarterly in Class C stock, and of course, as was stated in
I; in eg In, so the statutory labor of prepayment and advance
premium, contained in 404(d), are not controlling.
The fact it called it the purchase of Class C stock
is not controlling, the fact it was made is controlling.

It

ccmes under the old principle, recognized by this Court since
t

thvs beginning :>£ taxation, it's the substance and not the form,
the incisive substance, the incisive facts, as distinguished
from the form, that govern in all tax matters.
Mow, how about these amounts?

Now, these amounts

required to be paid, which are here involved, is only the first
.. : the threw columns of Class C stock, that so-called interest
override.
An amount equal to not less than 10 nor more than 15
per centum

of what?

I'm reading from the statists now,

Of the amount >f interest payable by it to the bank during the
calendar rrriod, 8 percent of the interest thus is required to

30

be paid.
Nov, this is right significant» essentially, it seems
to me.

This comes from the statuta.

I quote its

Payments

for such stock shall be made quarterly and when the regular
interest payments of the borrower are payable.
Now, there's no question about the regular interest,
at all.

We're paying regular interest of 6 percent at this

time, this period of time? that limit has been removed, we're
now paying ? or 8 regular interest.

But we paid 15 percent

more upon the regular interest.
Therefore, we do have a question.

A matter of the

payment of funds for what purpose?
Now, let's look at that just a minute.
paid?

That's the real question.

Were they paid as an investment?

Why were they

Why were these amounts paid?
Were we paying .100,000 shares

for the interest on the books, so-called Class C stock, as an
investment, because wa expected that it might be returned if
the discretion were so exercised in 28.4 years or 31.6 years,
without interest, without dividends, without any earnings?
Why, of course not.
The incisive practicality of taxation required it be
determined whether this taxpayer paid the $99, the difference
between the $100 so-called par and the nominal value found by
the Fifth Circuit and the District Court, for the use of money
or to buy an investment?

31
I don't think there's any businessman in the United
States who3d be foolish enough to pay $100 to buy these
so-called Class C stocks which may, in the discretion of three
bodies, be repaid at some unknown date, if the Congress doesn?t
change the law and if the bank doesn't decide to go ahead and
pay the refunds in some other manner,
Q

Mr» Satterfield, the Solicitor General made some

argument with respect to Note 8, I think, on page 3 of his
main brief, in which he set up the cost of the Class C stock
purchased, and offset that with the patronage dividends and
allocated surplus,

Do you recall that point that he made?

MR. SATTERFIELD;
Q

Yes, I do; I think I do»

What do you have to say about his contention on

that score?
MR. SATTERFIELD:
position is this:

May it please the Court, our

that, as is set forth in the statute itself,

these patronage dividends or refunds and allocated surplus are
a participation in the margin of profit of a bank that year
arising from the payment of the, as the statute says, regular
interest.
Now, this IS percent is entered at the end of the year,
the statute so provides and so does 70.145! of the regulations.
Sc the interest upon which the government now says we received
natrxiogo refunds, or received allocated surplus, didn't even
-Ist during the year.

They ware made at the end of the year,

32
at the same, time that the patronage refund and allocated
surplus were entered for the year.
Q

Well,, what's your theory of the impact of that

patronage refund and the allocation on the cost of borrowing
this money?
MR. SATTERFIELD; That actually has a result if and
when it ic repaid, 28 to 31 to 40 years later, to the extent
of the value of the money in 1958, which makes the year paid
ir. 1981.

To that extent it would reduce the cost of the

regular interest and also the interest override, which was
added to the regular interest.
to it really would reduce the cost to the extent of
its value by one dollar a share.
Q

Well, in your theory, if the Class C stock were

ever repaid, it would be income to the borrower then?
MR. SATTERFIELD:

Yes, sir.

We believe, it is our

position that if it ever were repaid it would be income,
ordinary income, taxable as ordinary income to the borrower.
And that may be 28 years or 31 years from then.
Q

In other words, you're saying this is just an

in coit income, this $27,489 for 1961 is in coit income on
which he may have to pay an income tax in some future year?
MR. SATTERFIELDs That is true, it is merely a
possibilityj and possibilities are not taxed.

And we have

pointed out"on page 7 of our brief, and further on page 9 of

33

our brief, 11 contingencies upon which depend the amount paid
and on page .9 mi1 re pointed out 7 contingencies or discretions
which have to be exercised if it ever is repaid*

So that's

7 avid 11 is 18 different elements enter into whether or not
we111 ever receive the in- coit income which might come as a
result of these actions, which arose from, actually, not the
entry ofthe first column at the end of the year, so-called
interest override or whatever it may be called, Class C
stock purchase, but from the payment of the regular interest
quarterly which was paid.
The interest of these entries under the regulations
are reads only at the end of the year.
Q

Mr. Satterfield, is the Class C stock pledged as

security for the cooperatives loan from the bank?
MR. SATTERFIELD: To this extent, Mr. Justice Powell,
that the Class C stock is subject to a lien securing any
borrowing by the borrower -- any loan by the borrower then or
thereafter made.

But the record shows on page 242 and 246, 246,

the testimony of the president of the bank, uncontradicted, is
that under no circumstances is it ever given any collateral
value.
Re testified that if an application is made for a
loan, and if the balance sheet shows Class C stock, whether it
be $1,000 or $100,000, they strike that out in arriving at the
valuation or the security given.

It is never used as security

34
to obtain a loan, it is technically liable to a lien for the
repayment of the loan,
The bank has never sold a single share of Class C
stock other than under compulsion of the statute,
The testimony shows that unlike the situation in
MPA, that there has never been a sale from one cooperative to
the other of New Orleans Bank for Cooperatives stock, the
situation being financially very different,
Q

Has there ever been a failing borrower?

MR. SATTERFIELD.s

Yes, there have been failing

borrowers.
Q

And what did the bank do about the Class €

balance?
MR. SATTERFIELD!

If, in those instances,- there was a

Class C balance, they would credit up to the balance and would
not pay one nickel on what was left over.
Q

Well, I’m just asking — did they get — did the

bank creditor or bank borrower get his loan reduced by the
amount of the Class C balance?
MR. SATTERFIELD!

Only to the extent that it was

required to balance off the loan, if it was sufficient.
Q

Well, all right.

Dollar for dollar, then, the

Class C stock was- credited on the loan?
MR. SATTERFIELD:
balance? otherwise not.

If it was required tc pay the

In other words,

35
Q

Well, the answer is yes?

In the actual instance

you're talking about.
MR. SATTERFIELDs

Mr. Justice, in the instance I *ra

talking about the answer would have to be no, because in that—
instances that ware in the record, there was an insolvency.
Q

Yes.

MR. SATTERFIELDs

There was Class C stock which would

balance off what was left, and additional Class C stock, quote,
"owned by the borrower58, unquote.
Q

Yea?

MR. SATTERFIELDs Which was not balanced off.
0

Yes.

MR. SATTERFIELD: And this additional Class C stock
so "owned", unquote, by the borrower was cancelled? he got no
money.
Q

Well, I understand that. But his loan was paid

off?
MR. SATTERFIELD:

If there was enough to balance it

off»
Q

Dollar far dollar?

MR. SATTERFIELD:
Q

Yes.

Dollar for dollar.

The bank didn't attempt to

collect from the bankrupt any of its loan?
MR. SATTERFIELD: To the extent that it might —
Q

Except by setting off the — except.by reducing

36
the Class C balance?
MR. SATTERFIELD:

Right.

In other words, it was «sed to balance,to the extent
it was available, it off.
Well, may it please the Court, we*<3 like to close in
pointing out this facts

And that is that the real and only

issue in this case is whether these payments of 15 percent of
the regular interest were made for the use of money, because
of the need of the use of money in order to obtain and use money
or were they made as an investment to obtain a capital incomeproducing asset?
I can see there can be only one answer:

They were

made under compulsion of the statute, they were made in order
to obtain and retain the loan.
May X call attention to the fact this intrinsic value
argument has no substance whatever.

Unlike the Home Loan

Bank situation in lending, one share, the qualifying share,
$100 was paid for it as far as our part was concerned, they
show it as $100 when they got the first share qualifying them
to receive loans.
But they, as they receive that, it mad® no difference
'i .,/ much stock they had, they had only one vote; they got that
vote in 1956 in MCC,

in 195? in Coastal.'

And all the stock

that * s involved in this suit did not give them another vote.
i -.0. not givc-5 then any additional asset in getting a loan, did

37
not give them any additional right to call on the bank for
services.

They didn't give them anything, except that, perhaps,

in the discretion of these parties they might receive — what?
The amount they had paid back in 28.1, 31.2, 17-point-so-many
years.
And the reference of the government to 14 years is
without any basis in fact whatever.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Satterfield.
You have ten minutes left, Mr. Zinn.
At some point in here I wish you'd comment on Mr.
Satterfield's comment on your footnote 8 argument.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. SINN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. 3INN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the •

■ Court:
We believe that there is a return on this investment.
Mr. Satterfield has stressed the fact that the statute provides
for the allocation of each year's profits on the basis of the
interest paid by one cooperative to the interest paid by all,
and that is what the statute provides.
But stock is purchased in the same proportion that
ix.v.orast is paid, and the statute might as well have provided
that the return is payable in accordance with the ratio of the
r -.-er purebas n bj esc! cooperative to the stock purchased by

38

all for the profits of that one year.
Mow, this is different from the division of profits
in an ordinary corporation.

If you buy stock in an ordinary

corporation, you're able to share in the profits of all years®
In this situation you are able to share in the profits of only
a single year.
As I mentioned earlier, however, it shouldn't make any
difference, there's no reason why an ordinary corporation can't
issue securities of the same type.
The fact remains that at the end of the period,
whenever that. indefinite time on the Class C stock is revolved,
that these people put in $19,000 in 1961 and they're going to
get back $59,000, whether it be 14 years later or 30 years later
is of no consequence, they're going to get it back.
Interest, Mr. Chief Justice, is not something that
you own, the divisible interest that you own and that you get
back; you don’t get interest back. And this is not interest.
it was the same situation in Lincoln.

It wasn't

current insurance, even though the only reason it was paid into
the socondary reserve was to get current;insurance, you got it
back.
Q

As I understand Mr. Satterfield's argument,

though., he said, X think, in response to a question from Justice
strife*, that whenever this windfall, this return comas, it will
i:.. taxable, aci ordinary income

Do you agree with that?

39

MR. 2INN:
Q

We’ll accept that, Mr. Chief Justice.

Beg pardon?

MR. SINN:

We’ll accept that, if that5s his repre­

sentation.
Q

Well, you won't win — I mean, you wouldn't say

that if you win in this case?
MR. zINNs That it's ordinary income?
Q

Would you?

MR. 2INNs
Q

I'm not sure I understand.

In your case you'd say it's ordinary income

even if you win this case?
MR. ZINN;

Yes, sure.

In addition to attempting to show that this stock
does, in substance, bear a return, Mr. Chief Justice, through
the four hypothetical© I attempted to show that even if it
bears no return, and that even if it gives the respondents
only the right to get their money back at an indefinite
future time, there's still no deduction.
What the respondents are seeking to deduct here is
interest income that they might have earned had they been
able to invest their money.
Q

Well, this brings you back to your analogy of

the $1,000 —
MR., ZINN:
Q

Yes.

--• non-interest-bearing checking account.

It

40
doesn’t make any difference whether you get ifc back in one
year, you’re saying to us now, or forty years?
MR. 2INN:
or 20.

Or ten years.

That's right.

Or 13 years

Because, under their analysis, you've borrowed $9,000

for ten years.

Now, what you're left with, you have $1,000 or.

deposit after that.

You don't earn interest.

If you had it

invested at r.n interest-bearing account you would have earned
interest.
But in

Hert v_. Commissioner, 30 years ago, this

Court held that income that you might have earned and didn't
isn't deductible.
Horfc

«a.fcTfjcv.MmC-aa

case.

And the respondents don't challenge the

We cite it in our brief, and they don't ask the

Court to overrule it.
q

But if X borrow from this bank, and this year X

have to pay $1,000 in to buy Class C stock because I’ve paid
that much interest, if and when I get that particular Class C
stack back you would say it's ordinary income, wouldn't you?
MR. 2INN:
Q

The thousand dollars you purchased?

Yes.

MR. 2INNs

NO.

Now, I'd like to make one final point —
Q

Mr. 2inn,

MR. SINNs
q

Yes, sir?

— before you proceed, may I come back to a

response you made a movent.ago?

Did I understand yea to say

41
that if the $39 is ever paid hack fco the cooperative, that it
would be regarded as ordinary income?
MR. ZINN:
Q

That is allocated fco —

MR. ZINN;
Q

The $33?

That it's deducting?

— the Class C stock?

MR. ZINN: That is allocated?
Q

That is allocated fcc the Class C stock,, and

which is at issue in this case.
MR. SINN;

On the assumption that they win this case

or lose it, Mr. Justice?
Q

No.

On the assumption that some time in the

future there is a distribution made on the Class C stock?
MR. SINN;

If the government prevails in this case,

then v?a wouldn't attempt fco tax the $100 that they'd be getting
back.
Q

That is what I wanted to know.

MR. SINN;

We attempt to tax the amounts in columns

2 and 3 on page 8.
Q

The first $100 would be a return of capital?

MR. ZINN; Right.
Q

Would it: not?

MR. ZINN:
Q

Exactly.

But the patronage dividend and the allocated

surplus, you would tax?

42
MR. EINK; That's right.
Q

As ordinary income.

MR. ZXNMs
Q

As ordinary income.

Mow, one final

And you say, I suppose, if I may interrupt you

once more, in response to Mr. Satterfield's point about this
being 30 or 40 years from now, that they knew that when they
made the contract and borrowed the money, and it’s part of the
contract money?
MR. EINNs Exactly.

Exactly.

And I think we pointed

out in our brief that even if it was 30 years, and without
regard to the allocated surplus credit, there would still be a
return of slightly more than 3 percent.
Well, in Lincoln it was between 3.15 and 4 and. a
quarter percent return on investment.
But we don't, as I say, I want to stress, we don't
rely exclusively on the fact that this has to be interestbearing.

We say even if the Court views it as merely the right

to get your money back, that under the four compensating balance:
hypothetical.?, that I've referred to in my opening remarks,
they are trying to deduct income that they might have earned
but didn't.
Q

But it is true that the only way he’ll ever

get his money back is if the bank is successful?
And can afford to pay off the Class A stock?
MR. ZZNN:

That's — well, that's true in the case of

43
any investment in a common stock

you only get your money back

if there is —>
Q

That's right.

MR. ZINN:
Q

— and it is successful.

Sort of like an income debenture or some such?

MR. ZINN: Exactly.
our brief.

That3s the way we described it in

At the end of the year you know you're going to get

back $59,000, and you paid $19,000 for that certificate? and
in the Midland-Ross

case, Mr. Justice Brennan, writing the

opinion for the Courtheld that that differential was ordinary
income „
One final point.

The Court, in the Lincoln Savings

case, not only discussed the secondary reserve but also the
Federal Home Loan Bank stock that-savings and loan associations
are required to purchase in order to be members of the local
Federal Home Loan Bank.

And the Court said:

Certainly the

FI-ILB stock is an asset and its acquisition is capital in
nature.
That's at 403 U.S. 356.
Mr. Justice Blackman?s statement there is hot
qualified fay whether you get a return or not get a return on
FBLB stock.

He recognized that that’s an asset and non»

deductible cast, because it was a provision of capital for the
Federal Home Loan Bank.

It provided, as he put it, liquidity

and availability of loan funds.

44
Now, that's precisely the function of the contribu­
tions to capital that we5re concerned with here.

They provide

liquidity and availability of loan funds.
Now, the fact of the matter is that certain Federal
Home Loan Banks throughout the entire 1960’s paid a return of
roughly one and three-quarters percent? one and three-quarters
percent„
Now, the going rate of interest during the 1960’s
presumably was more than on® and three-quarters percent, and,
nonetheless, there’s no room for the argument that any portion
of the contribution to the Federal Home Loan Bank capital is
deductible, because if they invested their money elsewhere
they might have, gotten 5 percent or 3.0 percent? but that is the
respondents' argument in this case.
They even say that the Lincoln case is going to be
back here next term, because they say — well, let's say
Lincoln got 4 percent, if Lincoln — if the going rate of
interest was 8 percent, they say that — and the fair market
value of the contribution to the secondary reserve therefore
was only 50 percent of the amount paid, they say that Lincoln
is entitled to deduct the other half as an ordinary expense,
that this Court really didn't resolve the secondary reserve
problem last term.
And we say that’s inadmissible, because there's other
value except value in the marketplace, and the Court recognised

45
that other value at 403 U. S. 356.
That's all I have, Mr, Chief Justice.
