ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,

MR. COME?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courti
This rase in her© on certiorari to the United states
Appeals far :-ho. Sixth Circuit, which denied enforce-

■r; :.

vc: at of the Board's bargaining order.

The question presented is whether an employer
violatas his bargaining obligation under the National Labor
Relations Act by

to bargain with the Union repsr

fcives of his employees about changes in health benefits which
the employer properes to negotiate with employees who have
already retired.
New, the basic facts, are theses

sfc si. s BsrbsssssB, Ohio, plant for the Pittsburgh

Plats GX&se Company.

In 1950, the Union and the Company

sag ti.v.t-sd e, contrast which, for th© first time, included

4

provisions for a pension and a hospitalisation and surgical
insurance plan.

At th® sssm time the parties orally agreed

that employees who retired could participato in the medical
plan by contributing the entire cost of the insurance premiums,
which would fo© deducted from their pensions»
In 1959, retiree benefits under th® plan were
improved, and as a result of contract negotiations in 1962 th©
medical insurance plan became contributory for the first time?
th© Company agreeing to contribute two dollars toward the cost
of insurance premiums for employees who retired in the future.
And this v?a3 available to both the retiree and his spouse; and
tr, v:

civc

a change was mads in the. pension plan to make

65 th.Es mandatory retirement age,
A now contract was negotiated in 1964, and that forms
th® basis for this case.

At that time the Company agreed to

increase its monthly contribution to medical insurance from
two dollars to four dollars,

The increase was made available

not only to employees who retired after the effective date of
th® contract, but also to each participating employe® in the
health plan who had retired on or after the effective date of
the 1962 contract.

In other words, it went back and definitely

reached employees who had already retired•
In anticipation of the enactment of Medicare, however,

gr©emant further provided that the Company could rescind
the tv.ee dollar increase in its contribution if a government

5

health program wero enacted.
How, Congress enacted Medicare on July 30, 1965»
This contract, as I said, was negotiated in 1964 and, by its
terms, it had until October of 1967 before it would terminate.
In November of 1965, the Union asked the Company to
v

in bargaining for the purpose of negotiating insurance

; to*; covered by Medicare.

The Company responded

several months later by stating that because of the enactment
■/if: Fodicare, it intended to rescind the two-dollar extra

contribution that it was making to the health insurance plan,
and it intended, as a matter of fact, to cancel the medical
insurance plan for retirees entirely, because the enactment of
Medicare would render the Company insurance plan useless.
Instead, the Company said that it would pay 'the three
dollars per month subscription cost of supplemental Medicare
for each retired employes who elected that and decided to
leave the company plan.
!.::ho Company conceded --the Union conceded that under

. ,a thvi Company, by virtue of its reservation, had
• ri eh’., to reduce its contribution to the health and welfare
oIon frc.« four dollars to two dollars.
\

However, the Union

vigorously protested fchs Company*s further action in cancelling
ili-3 Company plan altogether.
And th© Union further inquired what provision did
fclie Company intend to mak© for those pensioners and their wives

6
who ware under 65 arid not eligible for Medicare at all.
The Company challenged th© Union8s right to bargain
about- retirees and acknowledged that there was £ problem about
the pensioners who were under 65 and not eligible for Medicare,
and said that they would have to think about that.
Several days later the Company informed th® Union that
it would not cancel the medical plan for retired employees;
instead, it would write each retires, notifying them of the

pendancy of Medicare and indicating that it would give it the
option of either remaining under the Company plan with
.o-wj

■

v:.>ribution of two dollars on th© part of the Company

or got- lug out of th© company plan, in which case the Company

would pay the three-dollar supplemental Medicare subscription.
The Union objected on the ground that such change
should be the matter of negotiation and could not be don©
unilaterally by the Company.

The Company took th© position,

reiterated th© position that this was not a bargainable matter
and went ahead and did contact th© retirees individually with
th© offer.

As a result of it, 15 out of th® ISO retirees

availed itself of the Company's option? th© remainder remained

under the old plan with the reduced employer contribution.
The Union thereupon filed charges with the Board

ailthat fcfca Company's refusal to bargain about fch®
c ■area:: in th© health plan for the retirees violated th©
CGiry .ry 's bargaining obligation under the National Labor

7
Re1sfcions Act.
The Bear-] sustained the complaint which had been
vcsisB by the Board's general counsel, agreeing with the Union’s
ocnfccntisn that the Company had violated its bargaining
obligation.
There w.sre two bases fcr the Beard's decisions

first:

of ail, that rstireas remain employees under the Act for purpose
of their retirement benefits? and secondly, that even if they
v7@r© not. employees there was a duty to bargain about this matter
because changes in retirement benefits had a direct and vital
impact on the terms and conditions of employment of the
active employees as to whom there was clearly a bargaining
obligation.
The Board entered an appropriate order.

The Sixth

Ciicvit 6 :'nled enforcement of the Board’s order? end we are
her©.
Now, we submit that the Sixth Circuit erred for two
be/iic reasons, which I will try to develop*
Section 8(a) (5) and 8Cel) of the National Labor
Relations Act impose on the employer and the representative of
his employees the obligation to bargain with each other in
good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms ®nd
conditions of employment•
Now, by now it's well established that employers are
obligated to bargain with the Union representative about

8
pensions and insurance benefits to be enjoyed by active
employees upon their retirement*

tod, indeed

,

a large

percentage of Union-represented employees are currently working
under negotiated pension and retirement plans.
However, experience and the facts of this case show
that retirement benefits, once negotiated-, do not remain static,
but tfo;; arc- subject to unanticipated events.
employs© has retired.

Even after the

Monetary inflation is one obvious

unanticipated event? the other one•is a change in public law.
e

And fiiis case illustrates that,, because at the time the parties
originally hammered out the health insurance plan nobody
contemplated what effect Medicare would have on it.
So the question presented hers is whether, when the
changes are to be made in the benefits of employees that have
retired, the employer must bargain with the Union on behalf
of the employees, of the retired employees, about those changes,
just as it did with the Union when they ware originally
negotiated, or whether it*s going to bs free to act
unilateralXy.
New, this Court, in the Flbrebpar'd case, indicated
flu.- industrial practice in this country is a very important
c un:idnrsfcieui in determining whether a matter is a mandatory
:.u

ct of collective bargaining

id, further, the amenability

of tfef subject to the collectiva bargaining processes' of the
Act

9
This experience, we submit, supports the Board’s
conclusion that changes in retire® benefits are a mandatory
subject of collective bargaining, because, as shown in the
amicus brief ©£ briefs that have been filed by the AFL-CIO
and by the Senior Citizens Committee, employers and Unions have
for many years regularly and consistently bargained, not only
about the pension and retirement benefits for active employees
to be enjoyed upon their retirement but also upon improvements
in tine benefits for employees who have already retired.
Q

Hay I ask a question, Mr. Come, if employer

contributions are deferred wages?
MS. COMEs

Y®s, Your Honor, 1 think that that is

1 ,iic to thn Board’s argument hare.

That was certainly the

basis on which pension and retirement benefits were held for
>y upon retirement, was found to b©
within wages, hours, terms, and conditions? and to carry that
to retirees is just, wa submit, a natural progression.

It is

& deferred wag®.
Mow, both the Company and the Union, however, arrive
conclusion, principally in this fashions

They say Section

8(a) (5). of the Act requires the employer to bargain with a
representative of his employee®, subject to the provisions of
f.z .v,;;-by a r

they cannot

tJ',-3 kc$:;n:‘ng of Section. 8(a) (5) and Section 9(a).
Wa submit that there is no warrant for such a
restrictiv© interpretation of the terras "employee'’ and "unit”.
However# if w© prevail on our first argument, namely, that
there is a duty to bargain about the benefits paid to retirees
because of the direct impact that it has on the benefits of
the active employees, we don't even have to reach the, what
is th© principal thrust of the opinion of the Court of Appeals
and of th® Company her©.

That comes in only on the second leg

Id- that a breach of the duty of fair represents**
tion on th© part of a .union as a violation of Section 8(b)(1) (A)
of tha National Labor Relations Act.
I think there is a whole host of remedies for the
situation of a union that would be so unwise as to negotiate a
reduction of retire® benefits.

Th® experience that is shown as

14
to fch© way the bargaining has taken place in this area to
which X refer fch© Court to tha amicus brief for, shows that
invariably fch© negotiations have resulted in an increase in
retirement benefits.

There has been no instance that 1 have

been able to find where there has been such a relief.
Q

Wall, now, does the union claim or doss the

Board claim in this case that the employer was in the process
or did breach the collective ■— tha side agreement by what h©
had dene in this case?
MR. COMEs Well, we don’t — that is, fch© Board
get into fcho question es to whether or not the<r@ has
bean a breach of tha collective bargaining agreement ~~
q

if there had boon, there would be a remedy for

it?
MR, COME? Thor© would hava been a remedy, but there
could be a concurrent remedy, because some breaches of the
collective bargaining agreement may also b© a breach of the
duty to bargain collectively under 8(a){5} of th© National
Labor Enluticnp Act, and that's what w® submit we have here.

lint: c

This Court*© decision in th© Oliver case, we subnit,
establishes a proposition — a contrary proposition.

Because

in Oliver, as the Court will recall, it h©ld that a bargaining

Now, we submit her® that so here th© benefits paid

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MORTIMER RIEMER, ESQ.,
OF' BEHALF OF PETITIONER ALLIED CHEMICAL
m

ALKALI WORKERS OF AMERICA, LOCAL UNION NO. 1.

or. rir.llr:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
In 1950 feh© Union began to put together a compre­
hensive program of retirement benefits for the employees of the
company in its Barberton, Ohio, plant.

The first insurance

program, one of hospitalisation and surgical benefits, was an
oral agreement.

But by 1960 this became a written document,

supplementing the collective bargaining agreement.
The 1960 written agreement provided for a hospitalisa­
tion. and surgical program that was non-contributory.

And in

1962 the first contributory program was executed by the parties,
under which the Company agreed to contribute two dollars per
rrrdn idr smoicyaeg — for retirees.

The cost was otherwise

b cn; by deductions from the pension check of the retiree,
Q

May I ask, Mr. Riemer —

MR. RIEMER:
Q

Yes, sir.

— do retirees remain union members?

MR. RIEMERs

They remain. Your Honor, Mr. Justice

Brennan, they remain honorary members.

They have no other

obligation to the Union.
Q

No dues-paying obligation?

MR. RIEMERs They pay no dues.

They ar© considered

19

honorary members without the payment of clues? they have -the
right to visit meetings, attend.meetings, but not to
participate
Q

But not to vote?

MR. RIEMERs
Q

Not to vote, yes.

If the Union has something in the nature of club

facilities, s\s some of them do, are they permitted to use all
these facilities, generally?
MR. RXEMSR;

Wall, Your Honor, some years ago the

un:.:'n was going to start such a program, but it was abandoned

because of cost.
\j'ion

Nov? what they do, the retirees do use the

meeting hall as a congregating place.

for that purpose.

It's very ample

But there is no recreational program, as

such.
Q

Was the plan funded by .insurance?

MR. RIEMERs

Yes — the insurance program?

Yes, sir.

Equ.ifca.bl© Life Assurance Society was the carrier,
Q

I see.

Thank you.

Q

Of course some unions do have rather extensive

is-cr ou t local facilities and programs for retirees, -do they not?
MR. RIEMERs

Yes, indeed, they do. Your Honor.

And I could mention many that do, and it's a definit®

aregra:-*, of many unions.

But this small independent union has

never fe-sen able to bear the financial cost of such a program.
What I want to say, Mr. Chief Justice, and to the

20
xenrsbern cy the Court.* is that from 10 50 down to 1964 this
ixisurcaoo program was a negotiated program.

And it was usually

reached at or about the time collective bargaining negotiations
war© entered into and adjustments ware made to the pension
agreement.

So it was not a loos®, informal arrangement, but it

was a firmly bargained arrangement; particularly the 1962 and
the 1964 agreements.
Now, in 1962, and I think this is most significant,
when ih© collective bargaining agreement was negotiated, when
changes were mad© in the pension agreement, the Company exacted
from the Union a promise, as part of the collective bargaining
s-;;:co.c:r.;ent, that retirement would become mandatory at age 65,
effective in 1964.
then, at that point, it seams to me, the union member
i.eit look to the Union, the retire© must look to the Union,
for some quid proa

if I am going to b© forced to retire? whan

X reach the age of 65, then at least I must look to the Union
to b® sure the bargained-for program on surgical benefits, oh
hospitalization benefits is going to be carried out.

And if

there are going to be any changes in what the Union bargained
for me, since I must retire at age 65, then I must rely upon
the Union to accomplish those changes.
But what happened between 950 and *64, as 1cvb
related, was consistent with what was happening throughout the
entire industrial movement.

And this brings me to one point

21

tb-.t J. should like to make, and that is to decry what I think
is a misleading effort on the part of the Company to challenge
the statistics and the studies which have bean included in the
hs\. sb:' si the Beard, in the brief of the Union, and in the
amici briefs,
is hhih: we bad a‘right/ we think \-m had a right
to erh.i to this Courtis attention the voluminous studies of the
Ds ie is sv si Labor and other authentic information showing
the growth of tho industrial practice of bargaining about
hospitalisation and surgical benefits for retirees•
And under this Court's decision in Vaca v» Sipes and
in Pibrefooard,, 1 think there's ample authority to sustain what
v?as dona*

affective date of Medicare, and its impact upon the active
employees now retired, the Union was in a position*- to inquire
and asks

what did the Company propose to do com® July 1966,

22
when Mndieare became effective?
The Union had bargained for these benefits for these
;v:tp:v
j
•sm

n they

:cs active.

The benefits were being enjoyed

£L.\v they v73.ro retired# and they had assumed a continuing

responsibility to these retired employees which could not be
evaded..
And so in November 1.955 this is an entirely plausible
and understandable and# I think# correct *— from the trad©
union, point of view — inquiry to make of the Company % What
do you propose fco do in 1966 when Medicare becomes effective?
The Company replieds

Wa’r© going to cancel# because

Medicar® has mad® this program useless? we’re- going to take
back tho two dollars? and we’re going to contribute three
dollars to Medicare.
ibis was eh-ai Xcmged sharply by the Union# and had it
nt bo?a ■at; that point# had it not been for the challenge of
.5

Onicn, th& entire Company program in Barberton would hare

been canceled.
Not only retires® eligible for social security would
have lost the advantage of their insurance# but retirees who
were not eligible for social security or Medicare# because they
were below the age of 65# and their spouses# too# would have
lost their insurance.

But for the intervening and necessary

act of the Union# this was prevented? and two days later the
Company cama in with a now program of no cancellation# but

23
refusing to consider or discuss with the Union any modifica­
tion of the insurance program effective when Medicare became
— or want into effect in July of 1966»
Q

But you had a contractual right to keep the

employer from canceling — from terminating unilaterally its
own contract?
MR. RIEMERi

Yes.

I think a suit for breach of

confer,xt might have bean' brought# Your Honor .
individuals might have brought a 301 action.

1 think th©
But# if I may

suggest# Mr. Justice White —
Q

Was there any kind ©f a grievance or arbitration

provision in the side agreement?
MR. RIEMER;
Q

If there were —

Yes — in the side agreement?

-— disagreements# that they would arbitrate or

something?
MR. RXEMER: There was never any attempt to arbitrate.
The Union filed no grievance.

The collective bargaining
}

agreement does contain a very comprehensive grievance and.
•i

. rbifc- 'aticn procedure.
Q

is it normally an 8(b)(5) or an 8(a)(5) viola-

if ■;■■■:- employer refused to follow the grievance procedure
in a collective bargaining contract?

It normally is# is it

not?
MR. RXEMERs

X should think it would be.

don't think it’s normal# Your Honor.

But I

24

i thinX a failure ©a the part of m employer to —
what — to refuse to arbitrate, to refuse to follow the grievance
procedure, I think is ah 8(a)(5); normally this does not
occur, at least in my experience.
Tall me, Mr. Riemer, what interests of the active

q

©mploy©os were affected by the proposed company revisions?
MU. RIEMERj Well, the interests of the active
employees. Your Honor, Mr* Justice Brennan, affected by this is,
it seems to me, somewhat manifold, really.

The Union wrote

into the collective bargaining agreement a mandatory retirement
n:xivlxitn.
a’,.;;..-. .

The activo employees had the right to look to the
a program of tan©fits that would be rewarding, and.

vuvhopt above the mar© poverty level.
The dollar value of this hospitalisation and surgical
program, together with a reduced life insurance program, is of
soias monetary value.

The active employees know that its cost

is some tiling that they've given up in order that they may in
the future recoup, in a sort of deferred way, what they had
given up while active employees.
I think this is all inextricably intertwined? on©
generates another•
Q

In this to suggest that when they arrived at

sr;;3 Gl, the active employees* and were mandatoriiy retired,
hat. thve revisions would be applicable to them as retirees,
,:nS ibM they may be less advantageous than were they able now

25
to negotiate, they were able to negotiate for their own condition
after ago 65?

MR. RIEMERs

I believe that’s true. Your Honor.

Th®

more ddv.pntegeous provisions that can be made for the retires,

the -sore; tip active employee anticipates that upon reaching
the ago of 65 he will enjoy no less than the retire© is now

getting.

And hopefully more.
Q

bo. you think this meets the suggestion that the:

active membership of th© union might sell th© retirees down
the river sjomotim©?
MR. RIEMERs
Q
It answers it?

Mr. Chief Justice, absolutely not.

I say, do you think it meats th© suggestion?
That there is no likelihood that the actives

Oh.

Mr» Chief Justice, I have complete

.dv":. that, the- Union would not permit active employees

And X don’t think

worth its salt would dare take that position,.
Q

And if they did

And if they did —
?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Farmer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GUY FARMER, ESQ. , ON BEHALF
OF THE RESPONDENT PITTSBURGH PLATE GLASS CO.
MR. FARMER?

Mr, Chief Justic©, and may it pleas®

the courts
Wgj see fcha case, of course, quite differently from

my brother Mr. Com© and Union counsel, Mr. Rienver.
car-o

im

W® see the

beii-3 an issus not of the subject matter of bargaining,

but a furdsr.&atal issue as to the representation rights of
Union and the parallel bargaining obligation of the
employer.
Now

i-m

sea these two things as parallel, that the

Union's exclusive representation rights under the statute are
the same, or cover the same group or unit as the Act speaks of,
as the group which the employer must bargain for.

Now, we're

not. dealing her© with the question of whether it would be

permissible, on a voluntary basis, for this Union and this
Company t© make some arrangements to improve benefits for
-'pi-'.- already retired.
Thera is no issue of that? it's ©greed.

The court

b : b- : bold that on £i voluntary basis this could be done under
the Act.
We're dealing here with the question of whether it
is mandatory, obligatory on the part of the Union and on the

part of the employer to bargain for these people who have

21
already retired.
Q

I simpose, olso, it’s common ground, isn't it,

Mr# Farmer, that retirement benefits for present employees are
a mandatory subject of collective bargaining?
MR. FARMER?

No question.

Mo question, that it's

been decided for many, many years, under Inland Steel and
subsequent cases, that the benefits with which employees retire
are a mandatory subject of bargaining•

But this Court hold

in the Borg"Warner case several years ago that there are
different gradations of bargainings

there is permissive, and

there in mandatory, and there is unlawful.
There are things you cannot bargain about at all.
The.::.:.;

things you must bargain about; and there are things

that you may bargain about.
We say that the- -~
Q

Mr. Farmer, as a practical matter, when you're

dealing with a large number of retired employees, —
MR. FARMER:
Q’

— and this was quite a large number, 190?

MR. FARMER:
Q

Yes.

190.

190.
If they have so access to bargaining

through their union of which they are honorary members, does
that rsaan-

they must bring a class action or must — if they
/u yUhor in some sort of an

organisafcion?

28
hr.

Q

FARMERS

Well, Your Honor, —

Mid if they did, could they require the employsr

fco negotiate with thorn?
MR, FARMER*

Not in my opinion, Your Honor.

In my

vpiri?-n snccs the employer~employee relationship is terminated
ar-& people are riot longer working or performing services, that
they no longer have a right to band together to, let's say,
fore© concessions through collectivo action out of their formor
employer♦
It is my position, and it w<sa the position of the
court below, that the proper time for employees to negotiate
their retirement benefits is when they axe working and
performing the services for which they are being compensated
and which they're negotiating about.
Q

Well, Hr. Farmer, suppose the Union is directing

a negotiation —
MR. FARMER:
G

Yes.

«•*- to make a demand upon the Company —

MR. FARMERS

Yes.
v.

Q

for & provision in the collective bargaining

agree'.’ant, that no changes should fca made after retirement in
the retirement benefits, except in collective bargaining with
th® Union.

Would that demand ba a mandatory subject for

bargaining?
MR. FARMER:

1 dc not believe so.

29

Q

Why not?

MR. FARMER:
Q

Because they*re *—

They're bargaining now for the active employees *

MR. FARMER s They could bargain for the active
employees that there would he no change mad© in their benefits
after retirement.
Q

Without collective bargaining with 'the Union.

MR. FARMER:

Sow, that "without collective bargaining

with thr. Union", I think then is an attempt to project the
lining obligation into the retirement situation.

X think

®y could even bargain that if the cost of living went up,

the benefits would automatically escalate*
Q

Some of them have don© that, have they not?

MR. FARMER;

Yes.

And I think that's perfectly

valid bargaining.
But the point is that one© a bargain is made, while
the employe© is? working, as to what his benefits will be, this
1b a part of his total compensation, this is based on a
combined agreement and judgment by the Union and the employer

c.s to the value of the services which he is rendering? and
, £>:>:..;■ ■ oat in wng©s and benefits, soma 'of which are to h®
ckr.rernud until he retires •

And when he retires, he has ~~ he

'..o bargfiir to vest those benefits so they can't be
taken away and reduced by the Company or anyone ale©? and
all of this is valid.

But once this employee retires, it seams

30
fco me it’s contrary to fch© purpose of th© Act and it's unfair
to the employer to say that he must continue to renegotiate
after retirement th© value of this person's services.
Nov?, he cannot, as the court below pointed out, go

back and adjust his prices fco compensate for what he is going
hill or. fell© benefits of these people who have already
: :ohired, &r?cl so he is going to be subjected under th© Board
"."lew hare fco a continual repetition, repetitive revaluation
if services that have long sine© been rendered, for people who
are no longer rendering any services at all.
Now, wo say that this is contrary fco the whole
principle of. collective bargaining as set out in the statute.
It arises from th© statute, and it should be controlled by
the statute.

We say the issue here is:

MR. FARMER*

Nothing else except possible arbitra-

provided in some cases.

33
Now, if it. please th® Court, we think that this is a
new issue before the Court, but that it's governed by some
vary clearly established principles.
Now, up to this time» I would challenge th® Board to
produce a case in which the Board has ever held that a Union
can force bargaining for any person who is not a member of the
bargaining unit undor Section 9.

MR. FARMERS

MR, FARMERS
Q

Yes.

Are you talking about this particular —

the Union and th© Company.
MR. FARMERS Th© Company agreed to pay four dollars

a month sr. a contribution toward this medical insurance.

MR. FARMER: With the right to reduce it to two
dollars.
Q

l see,

MR. FARMERS The Company did not — the Company started

that agreement? but they did; not,- in the end.

Wail, let’s assume that the Company comes along

and just unilaterally increases its contribution for retired
employees to five dollars.
MR. FARMER:
The retirees themselves

Well, I think h@ definitely can do that,.

Well, the Union says that’s hurting; them, though;

that’s what ~~
MR. FARMER:

Q

How does it hurt the Union?

Well., it’s taking ~~ there’s less money

available for active' employees*
Mil, FARMER: Well, this concept of interest

to, because —

Well, I’m not talking about, the bargaining

part of it, I’m just asking you whether there isn’t, an

MR. FARMER:
Q

Oh, you’re talking —

that the Union already has with respect to

either increases or decreases?
ME. FARMER:

Well, if th© increase is a violation of
*

that agreement, certainly they have a remedy.

But I question

in x:y mm mind whether that would be a violation.

If I agree

to pay you two dollars and I voluntarily pay you four, I don't

35
quit® sea why that
Q

But if the Union is right, that it has a

substantial intereat in preventing increases to retired
employees which would take money away front the actives, then
it is a breach of contract.
MR. FARMER:

Agreed.

But 1 do not agree that the

Now, perhaps I haven't gotten your point.

and that was refused?

MR„ FARMER:

Mo question.

Mo question*

That they could go on strike?

MR. FARMER:

If the Board decision is right? they

could strike to force more benefits for retirees.
And even if they had no bansfifes? the people who
.retired without benefits of any kind? presumably under this
deed;.'ion of th© Board the Union could demand that a program of
hi-imSites ho instituted for people that had been retired since
.Viso, or whatever date.

And the Company would have to

negotiate if the Union didn't like what the Company did? was
willing to do? they could strike the whole plant —
G

Mr. Farmer? does --

MR. FARMER:
Q

— over that issue.

«*- this decision really go that far?

1 thought

it was limited to the question? whether,there being an
existing agraemnt? th© Union has any right to insist on
bargaining changes in sn existing agreement.
ms.

FARMER:

1 do not believe that that’s the Board’s

position, end I would say that if that were fch© position that
it would be pretty close to being correct*

In other words#

if the Company hare did violate that agreement# then it was

under Board decision a unilateral modification of an agreement
under Section 8(d) of the Act and therefore would be an unfair
labor pr&cfcic©.
-•m<; that is not m I understand the Board's

posit:!or-.

The Board’s position is that regardless of that

,; v-v;c: 'rasntr that as & general universal rule persons on retiremc-afc arc covered by the mandatory bargaining obligation and
the Union that happens* to be representing the active employees
which# incidentally, may never have represented the®© pepple,

never have —

if that union has a right to demand mandatory

bargaining for pocpl© who hav© left the employ of the company

v7{;

I didn’t read it as that broad a claim, but I

c■sv-.v.v?:-! in rebuttal to clarify that.

My impression

-tin «.trim xm® rather narrow, that the Company, the

cr/v.-ryt-.- cannot unilaterally make any changes without
nsgoti^i.ing." But we will see whether it was claimed that they
on the union side, could initiate a claim for increased
benefits and go on strike if they were denied.
MR. FREMEsu
Q

Yes, Year Honor.

That would hm & very important distinction,

38
wculdn * t it?
MR. FARMER s

Yes, and X would like to he as? th© answer,

too? b©ca«s@, as 1 understand it, the claim is a broad one,
that the Union represents these people just as it does th®
active employees, and it can initiate negotiations for retirees
the ©are© as it can the active employeest that it doesn't have
to wait until the Company does something or initiates ©era©thing? that this becomes a part of th© Union’s representation
rights and a part of the employer’s mandatory bargaining
obligation,
This is the way they presented it below# and this is
the bands on which the court bolow decided.
And, incidentally, we could add, I think, vary
little to the analysis of the court below, we are simply here
repeating, 1 think, arguments that have already been mad©
by th® court below, and w© think they have covered the case
in & most excellent fashion? and there’s very little that I
can add.
Now, let me just say aboixt the Oliver cases

Well,

certainly they do try to get a lot of mileage out of Oliver,
They are saying that In Oliver, of course, that was a case

wive..- ' tb.r ur-ion had.

a

legitimate interest, as this Court found,

in snaing that ih/rdr jobs as drivers «ere not eroded by
phony arrangements mad© with driver-owners; and therefore th©
un...:■:

r-?v.

;,cte m agr*smont that the amounts paid

39
to these own©r~driv®re would not be below a certain minimus».
That v'protect the erosion of the jobs in that bargaining

'unit.
These owner-drivera presented a direct threat to the
jobs of these employes drivers# and this Court so held in that
case o
Now, to & ay that these retirees# who have no
bargaining strength whatsoever# who &r© not competing for jobs#
and are not competing for wages# that they present ouch a
threat to these active employees who have the power to shut
down this operation any tin»© to get their demands# to say that
thee© retirees threaten them so much that the actives have to
h&vc. control over their benefits# I think# becomes almost an

,r.br,.v:d argument.

And X don't think that Oliver

was intended

to go that far at all.

In no case prior to this one has the Board ever come
to this • Cc-v -:t# or any other court, and made the argument that
.ght to rej

topi© who are not

in the bargaining unit.
&nd the Board admits here that retirees are not
in the bargaining unit.

In fact# the Board has uniformly

excluded them from all bargaining units# saying they do not
have a community of interest with the active employees and
probably are not employees at all,

They excluded them here.

They have excluded them,

They set up a unit of only active

40
employees? they did not include those people.
it seems to me that there is one aspect of the Act,
that is the industrial democracy aspect, which x would like to
discuss next.

JUSTICE BURGER«

That*® always a welcome

Whatever you say.
MR. FARMER:

Ten minutes will suffice.

X think that the court, as I said, the court decision
below, in my opinion, is sound and sets forth the rationale
which supports the decision of the court below.
I would just.like to make on® or two points that I
haven't touched on.
The Board has argued her© today, and I believe for
the first time, that the bargaining unit does not control the
scopo of the bargaining — does not necessarily control the
scopa of the h&rg&ining,
This, X think, is basic to this case, and this is a
change of position on the part of the Board, the position it
took in the court, below.
In the court below the Board conceded that the
c-bllgi1 iion tr> bargain is limited to the bargaining unit. And
?. Iv t petition is supported by a long line, unbroken line of

decisions by the Board itself sad by fch© courts; and it is

supported by the 3fcstut© •
I did not cite Section 8 (b) C 3) in the Appendix to the
f.:;f

l

did cifco 8(a) (§) which says that th© employer8©

bargaining obligation is to bargain with the representative of
Ms employes©©e ©object to Section 9(b).

Section 8(b)(3) ©ays

the same thing with respect to unions.
It says that a union bargains subject to Section §.
As th© court saids the Second Circuit said in on© of the two
HA casest v/here the XLA tried to force a company, or the
shipping companies in New York to bargain for longshoremen
in Florida anci other places, which were not in the same

bargaining unit, the Board went into court in that case -and
got to injunction against that strike and later held that it
v;r.3 a violation of th© Act to try to fores bargaining outside
th-i bargaiag unit.
in txat case» I believe it was Judge Friendly ©aids

•

itS ii.y:;;a the framework within which labor and manage-

.wont &:•-:& required to bargain,
And th© Court of Appeals hara, in a second IJLA case,
under similar circumstances, hold the same thing.

It said

/

that the extant of the bargaining obligation is determined by
the- certification ©f the bargaining unit.
what the Act itself says in Section

And that is precisely

9B

Now, tha Board would have to concede hare that

people v/ho have retired permanently and no longer ara employed
or performing services ©re not in the bargaining unit.

The

Board does not claim, as X understand it, that these people are
in -tlx© bargaining unit.
But they projact her® an entirely new argument that
a union can, under certain circumstances not clearly defined,
demand bargaining for people who are not in the bargaining
unit n
q

Ex* Farmer, in your view, would a union honor a

picket line consisting exclusively of retired employees

who

vc- re picketing for an increase in pensions outside of ?
contract?
MR. FARMER;

X think they very well might.

X know

on© union, at .least, that would and has, consistently, honored
such a —* well, a picket line by retired persons has been
honored traditionally in the coal industry.

And X can't

answer it. elsewhere, but I know that to he a fact, as far as
the coal industry is concerned.
Now, it seams to me, when Congress designed the Act,
' doeig,:;3& it around the theory of industrial democracy?
oyees, in groupings that the Board would determine

\f.ricn are called bargaining units, that they would select, by
,i najorifcy vote, their representative? and that representative
v;-3uld

th;:?n

represent all of them, exclusively, in that unit.
But, by like token, that representative was not

44
intended to have any authority to represent anyone who was not
in that unit for which it had he®» selected,
Now, in this particular case, the Board has certified
a unit, back in 1949, in which it excluded —- in which it
Hard ted the unit to active working employees? did not includo
those pensioners, and did not allow them to vote.

Now, that's

in accordance with fche Board's uniform policy which they
folic;.-; ; d in ©eery case in which this issue has ever coma up*
and they are saying today in their brief that they still would
not allow retired people to vote or b© a part of a bargaining
unit.
They say they don't have a community of interests

same bargaining unit.

And yet, inconsistently it seems to mo,

they are still arguing that tin bargaining unit representative
is their exclusive representative.
So this is representation without any voice in the
■-sfecdi.cn of the union.

There are provisions in the jftdt whereby

They have

no v-.v:.- in this particular union in ratifying agreements that
are made.

matter of practice, want to try to injure retirees.

the opportunity would still exist and we could not say, and 1

Mow, X would also like fco point out that in this, case,
which the Board «at on for two years before deciding what to

Suppose, Mr. Farmer, that these 190 employees

have managed in soma way to get together —

MR. FARMER:
Q

Yes.

— end engage a, lawyer and designate him as

thsir bargaining representative, as they could if they were
an active union.

In effect, a d® facto union.

Isn't the real

question whether there is an obligation of the employer to
engage In bargaining on th© issues?
HR. FARMER;

Yes.

Yes, X say there is not because

they are not employees, they axe not in any — and in order to
be, for there to be a bargaining obligation, it runs between
the employer and his employees; and one© they have retired

I think this is outside the contemplation of the

MR. COME:

Yea, Your Honor,

I think X might as well

start with that.
The precis© holding of the Board in this case is at

And the Board

* reading down

out that, although that is .not this case, that the logic of

But the emphasis, 2 suppos©, in that sentenc©

MR» COM: That is correct.

/laid as you rightly say, I think, in answer to

the basic question, when the Board said that this is a violation

MR. cOMBs That is correct.

Of course, the way the —

MR. COME? That is correct.

But of course the way

Mo — that is corrscfc, Your Honor.

Mr. Cora©# —

MR. COME%

But, X just wanted to say, without being

overly argumentative, that part of the reason that governs
whether you conclude that © subject is a mandatory subject of

colic

.:,T bargaining or not, is whether or not it is likely

to

of contention between labor and management, and

that it ror'.jra for industrial peace rather than strife to

subject it to the collective bargaining processes of the Act,
and that’s all that l meant by healthy, Your Honor.
Q

Let me so© if J. can explore how far this

logical substantion, X think is what you called it, logic of
the Board’s present position.

Assume a case where you have

,100 employees who have a vested interest in a pension of $200
a month by ®. contract negotiated when they wore active
employees.

No provisions in the contract for cost of living or

escalation or xsoprming increase•
;,{

•

The union, at the urging of

i?Jr shaver arguments they want.

MR, COMSj

In the Board’s view, Your Honor, as I

We’re only concerned with whether —»

whether they can.

That certainly opens up a

MR. COMEi

Well# I think that the sa® argument, could

have been mad®, and was mads, by the employers in '47 when they
were protesting the ©«tension of -the Act53 bargaining require­
ments to bargaining over pensions and health and welfare
benefits.

Tim whole history of what is a mandatory subject for

bargaining has been an evolving one.

are routinely accepted as hargainaibi©, in *35 or even in *47

Mr. Corns, if tha employer, during the term of
