Mr. Chief Justice, and raay it please

property.
MR. CHIEF .JUSTICE BURGERs Would you raise your voice

MR. M&RDIhhl2

Yes, sir.

fc response to this motion, the government served

ral

the

United States, in which he acknowledged that one of the
defendants, defendant Plamondon, had been overheard in the
course of a surveillance authorized by him, and which hejraed ne

ary in the interests of the national security of

the United States.
The affidavit stated fchfifc the disclosure of ■ this
information would be prejudicial to the interests of the
United States.
la cecities to serving the affidavit on the movants
rr-.ti filing it with the court, the government also submitted to
the court for its in earners, inspection the legs of the overnanririgs requested by the cefendant.

'Included in that in camera

submission, the government also offered the proof of the
an :hori2atioi\ of the attorney General of the United States for
the surveillance in Question., conducted prior to the .time of
the bombing.
The in camera exhibit Will show, which is now '

-Isc;ihowever, the government excised

the names of the organisations and individuals which were the
subject of surveillance, with the reception of chs organisation

That in or w ra sitbrnie-sicn will also show a character' •

FBI to the Attorney General, the organisation in question, its
its illegal aims, and information relatin

tyi:(3 which would ultimately lead to the destruction of the
United States Government by force and violence.
This in camera submission would also show that the
authorisation of the Attorney General was for a limited period

or 1- , it described the premises where the installation
sr:

i.dMit was involved and indicated that the surveillance

\me subject to periodic review.
Based upo.i' this in camera submission, the United
States urged that the surveillance in question was lawful.

ht-uringa should be disclosed to the defendants a® a prelude
to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not the
information contained in the logs contributed in any wise to
th<3 prosecution of the defendant Plaiaondon,
l't xach this holding on the basis that the President
of the United States was without authority to authorise a
surveillance absent the judicial interposition of a warrant
by a sitting Federal judge.
*ihe United states immediately petitioned for a writ o

aefaru.L 1-' tla Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals;

the Sixth

Circuit unanimously hold that mandamus was an appropriate
reicady, butr by a divided court, concurred in the judgment
of the .District Court on the basic — in the words of Justice
Edwards
Co. ■

that there was not one phrase or word in the
..ti: n of the United States, the statutory law of the

United States, or the case law of the United States that
vuvpteil the. President of tit . united States from provisions
of the Fourth Amendment.
We do not contend here, Your Honors, the President
h

u hates

either individually or acting through

the Attorney General, is exempt from the provisions of the
wit or is above the Provisions of the Constitution

8
We do suggest that this case puts into issue an
intelligent© function and procedure which has been sanctioned
by six successive Pr-sidents,

-.thing through twelve successiva

Attorneys General.
ft'hile the constitutional issue is grave, and the
4talmas, as far e.s the government is, concerned, are high, the
iasue before the Court can be easily.framed.

Stated negatively" ,

the question is not whether electronic surveillance is a
permissible governmental tool, for now we find that the
question is whether In the limited area of counter**intelligence
activities the President of the United States way authorise
electronic surveillance in the absence of a warrant by a member
of the Judiciary of this nation.
In order to understand the case, to properly resolve
in, 2 think v.'-s must first understand the factual setting, as
distingui shed from the other cases that have been before this
Court.
Shis is not a case such as the Kata case, or the
•ili/ak .case, or 0*Brian or biderraan , where electronic
c■ trvalliance was auhh,orient. for the purpose or obtaining
in a criminal proceeding,

tor

aiso f . ■. n in these cases, v-liere the defendant was the target
of the electronic surveillance which was authorised.
'■

a, as to had in the Clay case, a situ at nor.fortuitously — or fortuitously,

9

depending upon the ontcoaie of this case — happened to dial
a number which was the subject of the surveillance authorised
h

the President of the United States, acting through the

Attorney General,.
the government contends that, contrary to the
distinction made by the lower court, that the President of the.
United

is imbued with two powers in order to carry out

dtc-i-’

two reapersibiXitiee,

Both lower courts distinguished the

£ case on th© grounds that the power exercised in that ea$«
was an aid of the powers of the President in the area of
foreign affairs, it misted

that power to defending the

inter-sots of tic Uni ted States against the acts of a hostile
foreign power.
the United States urges that these two powers are

separate.- arx distinct.

The one power, the power of the

President in th© area of foreign affairs, is granted upon the
fact that the President is the exclusive national organ of the
United States in the area of foreign affairs.
Tho other rower is granted upon the responsibility
rzn: >- bligaiion of the President to protect the security of the
utemies, whether foreign or domestic.
haetuae counter-intelligence activities often involve
ho Vs ;

soios confusion has come to exist.
oh::ohov intelligence activities involved in the

o.. ■

f

.i; ,

eff&irs the purpose of the surveillance is to

10

thr irrsiuani of the United States to attain the on•••• ! : .

. hrrxtion. necessary to him, to compete on

at too:- no equal footing v/ith the information obtwined hy
foreign powers with whom he has to deal.
In the area of national security, however, the

hiteliigenuo that is sought is for an entirely different

purpose, and the power, the responsibility are grounded upon
the President's function in protecting the national security
against the enemies of the United States, whether foreign or
domestic,
Out of: tills confusion of dichotomy, the cases have;

die-cussed both powers as if they were one.

Ane I think this

nts up most eloquently the confusion which has existed
Irtvean foreign and domestic intelligence.
The government contends that as a legal and as a

oractic iX matter you cannot distinguish between foreign and
domestic intelligence unless you use the situs of the installs-

tier as trio basis for making the distinction.
Both lower courts, however, ware not confused with
this problem.

They did not reach it.

The respondent court

grew dr cl its decision on the basia that the intelligence
'... rd.r : t.

rurcinad hare was for the purpose of surveilling a

domestic organisation, and failed to distinguish the different
the purpose of obtaining intelligence

imc 1 -.gear now only of the constitutional authority of the*
:■■■■;aident in liar ores, of national se cu r i i:. y a f. f«: i r s.
<}

Of course the Congress of the United States has

a groat deal of constitutional authority in the area of
internal security ani domestic affairs.

I suppose? if your

araurant in corrects, that Congress could delegate an agent of
the Congress to do this investigative surveillance, could it
not?
MU MABDI&s: s

The Congress has undoubted authority

in t:hs area of ratione:! security, and I think? as pointed out
in the amicus brief filed by the National Lawyers Guild and the
Black Panther Party in Article 1, Section 15, the Constitution
prevideo or states that the. Congress shall provide for the
mailing of the militia of the United States in the event of
insurrection.
the ericas brief assorts that because of this
provision the Congress of the United States, distinguished from
the President, has paramount authority in the area of the
internal affairs of the country,
7, would point out in that regard that the Second
a,: ./'['f in furtherar.ee of, the provision of Article 1, Section

12
15, did p?:c?lck2 for tf-s calling of the militia end reposed that
responsibility in the President or the United States.

Well, my ernes, ticn. is directed to this:

the Congress of the United States has broad powers —•

Yes, sir.

It gives a detailed basis for why it is?

ME, MARDXMJs

E5o, X would. say that it would be

cenelusionary, Your Honor, more than setting forth each specific
fact.

Heap- in mind the

cision-making process in this are

is based upon the entire spectrum of Intelligence information
available to the Attorney General and not only the information
supplied him by the Director of the FBI.
Q

MR,

toll, :.s that subject to any review by anybody?
k‘ARDI&Hs

Limited judicial review, .1 would say,

Your Honor.
Q

«all, how limited?

MR. MARDXANs

In this area I think the review should

— is limited to a determination of whether or not there was a
gross abuse of discretion by the Attorney General acting for
the President in making the authorization.

determining that with nit facts of some kind?

'Jell, what do you need other chan conclusions?

MR. JsJJjJli:::

I woe Id any, Your Honor, that this gees

19
right to the heart of ths natter.

In this area certain of

the information which in available, all of the information
which is available to the Attorney General of the United States

and through '-da to the- President is net available to sash
investigative agency of government.
There“s an entire spectrum —
Q

2s this available to the courts?

MR. M&RDIAN:

Q

All that information is not made

:$

Well, now, how does the court determine the

constitutional rights of the persons who claim their right not
to be surveilled?
MR. MARDIANt

We suggest that in the limited area?

connter-Ante11igence activities of government. as distinguished

fr-vr the situation where a warrant is sought for prosecutive
purposes, that the Executive function in this area is somewhat
limited, and that, for the President of the United States,
acting through the Attorney General, or the Attorney General
himself, or one of his subordinates, to lay before a sitting
Federal judga the entire spectrum of information consisting of

teletypes # letterhead memoranfium, and all of the information
that coma-: from not enly the FBI but from other agencies, such
v.: the Gar'-':.rat Intelligence Agency, the National Security

Agency, the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the

bcg-ericrent of the Treasury, and other investigative agencies

20
of the gover/Uv.-::.;it, all of these are reposed- all this informa**
.

d with the Attoi

United State:'? before lie mates the authorisation or grants the
authorazation requented.
Q

thy cculdn* t that foe shared with the Federal

judge in camera?
MU. KAROXlK;

I think, as we attempt to show in
. *

our brief, the function —hell, let me ask you:

Q

Does the Federal judge

take the same oath the Attorney General takes?
MR, MARDIAN%

Yes, sir.

The function of the .Federal judge in criminal cases
is twofold:

one, the judge must determine the need for the

evidence sought; he then must make a determination as to whether

or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been
committed or is ahor

to be committed before; he authorizes

the warrant.

,

. ,

Now, the first of these, decisions» as to whether the
information is needed, such as in the area .of national security counter-intelligence information, if you please, it is the
government*a position that the magistrate, the sitting Federal
jooge is not in a petition to determine whether' or not the
, . bn..no. ion. lo naeio b, ouch less appreciate,, in many eases,
,, importance of the information sought.
i

.re; i

Unless there is

that bodge, along with any one of over 600

Federal sitting judges, all of the information available to

the Executive in the area of national security*
In this cor-.v-eci.ion, «justice

Telford Taylor addresoed himself to the problem in connection,

.

if you >; lo&re, font with respect to the authority of the judge
and the ability of the judge feo issue a warrant in an ordinary
criminal case.
Jmd if 1 may 15<3 like to quote from Professor Telford
Taylor.

Not that 1 ascribe to his views with respect to

warrants issued in criminal cases, but he sayss
business is it of a

What proper

at experience or facilities

dora he have that will enable him to decide whether or not
.surveillance of a particular typo if warranted in a particular
case?
He is pointing out, I think, the seme thing that was
pointed out in the Report of the Committee of Privy Counselors,
when, they .addressed themselves to this question in England.
.

uiawtion flare van-' whether or not the. power to issue

.- v- .t

for eXrrfcroaic surveillance should remain in the

r-.: artery of farre or • rule fa reposed in the Federal
Judiciary.
Q

Of course the Privy Council isn't bound by the

Fourth Amendment.
MR. M-iRDlAW:

l;o, fat X think the Privy Council Report

22
is acutely aware of the right of privacy that exists in
England, as much es

; i ' " -'

.;

has,

And

'

addressed itself to the question of whether or not the granting
of this authority# counter-intelligence cases, is in the best
interest of the right of privacy of the individual. And it
concludes that it is not.
It concludes# in its report# there will be a
weakening of the procsss# that there will be a diffusion of
authority to any one of the Federal Judiciary or the judges in
■i V' •

England# rather than reposing that responsibility in one man
and one man alone.
And we would suggest that the interests of privacy
of -.he American citisen it:- better protec ted in limiting this
authority in the area of electronic surveillance in«

counter-

intelligence cases to one man, the Attorney General acting
for the President of the United States, rather than to
proliferate it amongst ail of the Federal sitting judges in
the' United States •
And w3 say that not. in connection with those cases
the judicial process is one of determining probable caussa,

tfvrv

bat only in those cases and in the limited area of counterIntellicence where the decision-making process requires a
j:,.

:-.:-,it <: V to. fit a ..i&ed for the intelligence, information sought.
v:q

' v '.it 1>2 svygest in this regard, also, that information,
by th.

gov-srnrssnt for counter-intelligence purposes

23
in this area is not used for prosecutive purposes, and is not
sought for pronaoutive purposes,

Q

cell, 1 understand the claim here is the

Lone*

i, rath

that

were before the court, the respondent court, take the position

that it was, and they wanted to find out whether it was,
hm l right?
MR* MARDIAN:

i believe that that is their contention,

but 1 think that the in camera exhibit will show beyond
question that the authorisation in the case was totally
unrelated, and the information obtained was totally unrelated
to the crime for whirl, these defendants were indicted,
Q

Doss it show that it wasn’t used.?

MR. MARDIA'dTs

Yes, sir.

1 think an in camera

or {ruination 'rill disclose, as the Fifth Circuit found* in the

Clay case, that the information contained in the logs could
not, in any wise, have —

G

-ha CI.ry case was foreign espionage,

wasn’t it?
MR.

mvZ'Xlti: i

Jx th cases is the same.

The burden of the court, however, in
We do not have, as we had in Alderman,

as was described by counsel in that case, caseloads of
©1 '‘•chronically : sonite red conversations which would require ~~

which the court oculo have to examine in juxtaposition to the
skeletal averments of a criminal indictment.

We have, as the

24
counsel in fcb.o filden:a;ra case suggested, not even sheaves of
paper, something less than sheaves of paper*

Not unlike

Johks hot materials, act unlike, grand jury minutes, which
this Court, e-s could the Circuit Court and the District Court.,
exairdn-ad to determine that the overhearing s wei:a totally
unrelated to the crime for which these people wore indicted.,
Ano; I think that beyond question the in camera
exhibit will show that the purpose of the surveillance was for

the. sole and limited purpose of obtaining counter-intelligence
information as distinguished from prosecutive evidence in' a
criminal case *
Q

Well, this argument you make, even on the

ato-rifsption that the surveillance was illegal?
MR. MARDXMU

2 think it would apply equally, yes,

sir, Mr. Justice.
Q

Even if the surveillance were deemed

to

be an

illegal one by this Court, that it nevertheless didn’t taint
these proceedings?
MR, JfikRDX&M t

1 think in the —

MR.

£ think in the setting of this case

the burfan would be no greater than the burden of the court,
the Fifth Circuit Court, in the Clay; case.

And that position, you don't think is

ME, MAI«DZAR>
Alficvr.!an,

2 don't see it a® inconsistent with

2 think the fact® of the Alderman ease are far

different than the facte it this case.

-la the Alderman case,

as counsel pointed out» the surveillance was authorised for
tha purpose of obtaining prosecutive evidence to ba used in
a criminal case, and it was directed against the defendant.
Mxidf as in that case, 1 would assume — I diin51 lock at the
record — that there care literally boaclo&da of electrically
monitored telephone conversations.
In this case wo have a situation, as in Clay» where,
as I said» the defendant unfortuitously -- or fortuitously,
depending on the outcome of this case

Mod

t

think the in camera examination would

disclose that fact.
Q

I tak© it from your brief you also argue that

nothing in the Safe Streets Act precludes this kind of an
argument?
MB. MARDXAH:

2 would — I hope to got to that, and

I would concur that it doesn't.
X would like, if 2 may, to turn briefly to answer
-eseeoi-.M

leol of constitutional authority.

And 1 thin*:,-in this regard, we must recognise that
id■;>. c-or.nrfifrvt-.io ■of authority of the President must be gleaned
fro

readihe

' ;n itself. And I should

28
like, if I ray, re address myself very briefly to the provision
of the Consti.tr•;:.ion, which the government deeras applicable to
this case.
Before yon do, let me ask yous

do yon rely on

the Safe Streets act at all as an authorization?
HR, UMfflXMs
Q

Yas, sir.

Yes» Your Honor.

So that ewa if the President, absent authorise-”

ties by the Congress, didn’t have independent constitutional
power to do this.:. your argument is that the Safe Streets Act
authorizes him to do so?
And the Constitution would permit the Congress to
authorize him to do so?
MR. Z'V.hRDXMt

In the setting of this case, I would

rather argu-v, Kr. Justice, that we read -the Constitution along
with tfco sti-.-l: urory 'provision, and that in itself would be
sufficiant for the Presidential authority in this area,
1 think absent the constitutional enabling act,
the congressional enabling act, that we would have a more
difficult case, but I think in that case, as 1 hope to show,
the President would have the constitutional authority in this
limited area to engage in electronic surveillance- for counterintelligence purposes.

?. ve il' like to point first to the Preamble to the
Constitution, which sets forth the purpose of this Republic.
One of the prima: .

:ated purposes of the Preambl

27
is to insure domestic tranquility.

The insurance of domestic

tranquility, we would submit, involves an Executive function

as well as a Legislative and a .Judicial function.
Article II, Section 2, provides and it reposes the
Executive function of the United States in the President of
the United States.

And Article IS also requires that the

President take an oath that he will, to the best of his ability,
preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United
States»
I submit in this regard that the protection of the
Constitution, or the oath to protect the Constitution is not
an oath merely to protect the document itself, but to protect

the principles under which the Constitution was adopted, and
the rights guaranteed by that Constitution.

Q

Do you think that argument helps you in this
t

case?
MR. M&RDI&Ns

Yes, sir, I think I would hope to show

that it doss.
In Article II, Section 2, the Framers of the
Constitution designated the President of the United States as
the cOi.'su'.ander-in-chitf of the Army, oi* the Navy, and of the

•vd.itia of fcfco several States, when called into active service
by him.
In Article II, Section 3, it enjoins the President to
take cars that the laws of this nation are faithfully executed.

acts of Congress, but to the, on forcemeat of the rights, duties ,
and obligations growing out of the Constitution itself, our
international relations, and all other protection implied by
the nature of our government under the Constitution,
Article IV, Section 4, which is oftentimes overlooked

That Article provides that the "United States shall guarantee

what is now 10 U.S.C. 1031, that the President could call the
militia of the- several States into Federal service and authorises
him to use such force as ha deems necessary.
And this is a quote from the provision of the Act"as
he considers necessary to suppress insurrection,1*
This is an Executive function reposed in the President
of the United States,
332 provides that whenever the President considers
it unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages, or
rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it
impractical to enforce the laws of the United States in any
State or Territory, by the ordinary course of judicial pro­
ceedings he may sail into service the militia of any State and
use such of the Armed Forces as he considers necessary to
enforce those laws or to suppress rebellion.
Section 333 of 10 U.S.C, provides that the President
may use the militia or the Armed Forces, or both, or any other
means and ushall take such- measures as he considers necessary
to suppress in a State domestic violence, unlawful combination,
or conspiracy that seriously interferes with the execution of
the laws of the United States."
We would submitin this regard, that Article XV,

to Presidential powers as they pertain to invasion or domestic
violence

rvygest to the Court that at the time or our
ar. at the time of the Constitutional

31
Convention, at the time this very Constitution was enacted,
there was? serious question as to whether or not this Court had
the power of judicial review.
It was asserted at that time, when this Court
consisted of five' members, that a majority of that Court could,
if it had the power of judicial review, substitute its
judgment for the judgment of both Houses of Congress that the
people of the United States had elected.
Justice Marshall answered the question, but I think
Alexander Hamilton answered it even more eloquently, in the
Federalist Papers, No. 80, in which h® saids

To argue that

But, prior to this case#
i

there has never been a serious challenge to the basic rule
that ordinarily searches and seizure a must be made pursuant to
duly issued warrants„

tod if they're not# they’re unreasonable.

Indeed# the government for forty years has admitted
repeatedly that the fruits of electronic surveillance#the fruits
of unauthorised searches and seizures are not admissible in
evidence.

£11 during this period to which Mr. Justice Marshall

referred# \ hen tha Department of Justice was operating under
Presidential authority, the government admitted during all that

I think so, and we're in

the dark here, Mr. Chief Justice, about the facts? all we
know is that the Attorney General said, and said to the
District Court and to the Court of Appeals:
organisation.

this is a domestic

Nothing about foreign activities, and the most

they've said is that foreign activities may be involved."
That — in the domestic organisation, not this one,

They interpret

just as this Court interpreted it in Camara and

in 'Kate and in Burke.
.

Well# the Committee

They say "reasonable" — the test of

the standard of reasonable shall be the probable--

They make it very clear.

So when they use — the Congress used this language#
they meant that in a domestic situation# if the government

they say, the gcvaxm^nt says the Fourth Amendment
does not prohibit all starches and seisuras, but only
unreasonable ones.

She test for deterraining reasonable*';..-' §:®,

they say, is to weigh the competing interests involved.

And

‘they then purport to balance the competing interests, and they
aay, they fine, naturally, that the government interest in
protecting national security, the physical security of this
country outweighs the invasion of personal rights resulting

from the surveillance•
Of course it ignores the essential second step In

ing the -national security against the rights of

these three defendants.
But. the determin at ion of whether a search is

interests, the proces:.', must begin with, to quote this Court
in Camara — I've never known the correct pronunciation? I hope
itss “ca-mar-a” — one governing principle justified by history
by current experience that has consistently been followed,
that ..'tcopfc in

trtair carefully defined classes of cases a

1 resuirumanfc is not merely on® method of

Itesyblie cauce, said the Court in Camara, is the

is tested.

Sad the burden, the burden is on those seeking- an

«jscv.iption from she tva::r;?at requirement to show a need for it;
not just a read to search but a need to search without a
warrant.
How, of course there * s a governmental interest.

Who

would dispute that there:s a governmental interest in protecting
the fabric of society itself, as the government puts it in its
brief?

But that's not the interest at stake in this case.
In Ctrera, as you will recall, an almost identical

argument was made in principal:

"That the general health and

safety of the entire urban population is dependent upon enforce­
ment of minimum fire, housing, and sanitation standards.B

And

thus it was claimed that required systematised inspection of
all physical structures without a warrant.
But , as this Court noted, the argument missed the
icark.

The question was not whether these inspections may be

, but whether they may be made without, a warrant.
it is in this ca.se.

And so

The warrant requirement is no mere

formality.

MR. KINOY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the

2 rise before this Court to represent the three
individual respondentos

John Sinclair, Lawrence Plasnondon,

0‘ohn Forrest.
But, as the Court of Appeals has stated so powerfully

in tie opinion before, this Court, the thrust of this case now
go 3 far beyond the rights and liberties of these three young
raan.
v:.v: government has seen fit to use this case as a

54
vehicle for propelling a claim of executive power sc omninous
in its implications and sweeping in its dimensions that it has
transformed this appeal into a case which, as this Court has
Maid, touches the bedrock of our political system,
Mr* Mardian has seen fit this morning to call upon
the authority of the great Chief Justice in Marbury.

X would

suggest to the Court that in the words of that Chief Justice
this case has become one of those rare cases of peculiar
delicacy, which call for the historic role of this Court as
the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.
How, the considerations, X suggest to the Court,

openly expressed and frank attempt by the Executive to use this
case to obtain the imprimatur of this Court for a program of

of the government»
s?or7 as Mr» Gossett has pointed out, and in the word
of Judge E.hwards in the Court of appeals for the Sixth Circuit
this would, to place it bluntly, erase the Fourth Amendment
from the domestic life of this country, the Amendment which
this Court has taught is the embodiment of fundamental
principles of liberty.
But 1 would like to suggest to the Court that the
most serious consequences which would flow from this Court’s
placing its imprimatur upon this claim of power would be the
stifling of. the political freedoms guaranteed by the First
.Amendment, the continued vitality of which rests — there's
been a great deal of discussion today about the security of
the Republic and the. security of this government.
Well, Mr, Mercian did not include in his discussion
to the Court the deepest teachings of this Court that the
security of the Republic basically depends upon preserving
the essence of the system of political freedom, those great
words of the Chief Justice, Justice Hughes, in DeJonge:
preserving the essence of the political freedoms of the
country.

only on the contemporary European lessons of tyranny this

arbitrary general searches and seizures always, but always

The concept of the Court of Appeals that beyond doubt

the First Amendment is the cornerstone of .Snarican freedom,
and the Fourth AErandsnant stands as the guardian of the First*
Mm

this reflects the teaching of this Coart in

How, the power which the Attorney General states

surveillance of domestic political opposition, of which the
present record. Appendir A to our brief, for example, is but

Already the subjects of the Attorney General’s

auspicion *—» and I us a that word advisedly — fail on leaders
of the Antiwar J-iovsment, black militants, Catholic activist
pacifists, advocates of youth culture.
But what is the deep danger to the country that this

claim represents?
As formulated her© this morning and in the briefs

Mid to me the most disturbing aspect of this ease

is the frank willingness of the Executive to engage in such a
program.

And in its eagerness to sustain such a program, the

Executive attempts to evade the prohibitions of the Fourth
Amendment, the question Justice Marshall asked from the bench o

The majority opinion;,

the Court in Camara, adopted approvingly the

dissenting opinion of Justice Brennan in Abel, Abel v. United

Camara opinion, that this misses the whole point of the Fourth
Amendment, that the right,

protected by the Fourth Amendment

activity taken from you unreasonably*

That’s not the right

protected.
The* right protected is, to use again the words of
this Court asaiu and--again, the sacred inalienable right that * s
used in Boyd, the Words in Boyd, the words of Justice Brandeis
in Olmstead, the absolute right to privacy.

That the issue is

not why that right is being violated, the Fourth Amendment
s-i'ands to protect the citizens of this country from arbitrary

It i::c-an& ms a little bit to hear the argument made

You must

— for reasons of State, for reasons of necessity?

though we can't tell you all the facts of those, because they
reside in the head of our Chief Executive officer# known as the
Secretary of State.
Those were precisely the arguments raised in England.
Those were the arguments the Fourth Amendment was designed to
eliminate.
Mr. Mardian a argument is not with us.

Mr. Mardian’s

argument is with those who wrote the Fourth Amendment *

Mr.

M&rdian’s argument, and the government's brief, reads as if,
saying that. Oh, it“s perfectly all right, we can do all these
thinga because we’re conducting investigative intelligence
gathering,as if the Executive has limitless, uncontrolled powers
in the area of political association, beliefs, and activities.
All of which, as this Court taught in Stanford, all
of which are affected by the general searches conducted here,
as it the general, searches because, the government says, the
general rxeeutiva ~~ 1 think it's important for us to be
precise in our language here.
’’the government" here.

X prefer not to use the term

The issue is too profound and too

serious.
TV

Executive says that if these general searches

v’:-nu;:alcars lav. ad to the purposes of immediate criminal

62

prosecution, then we can do whatever we like in the vast area
of political association, beliefs, and activities; we can have
whatever wiretapping we want to have there, and it doesn't matter
what effect it has on people's .willingness to engage in politi­
cal activity£■ on people's willingness to engage in political
association*
X suggest that this Court has taught, and only recently
has reaffirmed, the profound words which this Court now has
written into fundamental law of Justice Brandeis concurring

in Wbitnsy v * Callfor.aia, and only recently in Brandenburg,
did this Court write those words into the fabric of our law
that government action which impinges on the delicate and
vulnerable freedoms, the words of Butnam, is tolerated if at
all only when required to prevent the moat imminent, immediate,
serious, goalless action of a clear and present danger of a
substantive evil of a serious nature within the power of the
government.
But the argument of the Executive here is the total
rejection of Justice Brandeis's philosophy, and the philosophy,

1 suggest, of this Court, and the philosophy of the Constitution
of the United States, which Mr. Mardian has told us the
President is sworn to uphold.
Because the Executive now demands the power for

And the Court pointed out that, used the words* fear

But that’s what this Court sits here for, is to

protect those ftmd&r.antal values ? those judgments were made - •
when the Fourth Amendment was written,
Nov?, 1 suggest to the Court that no program of
government activity which touches the area of the First
Amendment and First Amendment rights has ever come before this
Court for review which so totally ignores the most elementary
teachings of the Court.
Bscamination of the Attorney General’s affidavit is

mt in this Court now they're running ffrex that
affidavit*

It5;; perfectly clear why they're running from the

.buieavit.

Because the affidavit,

ok

its face, reveals the

65
fundamental violation, of the First and Fourth amendments.
But in ona ^eass there is something deeply serious
that is reflected by their running from the affidavit«

N©w,

this five days prior to argument# the citizens are not even
allowed to know the hi .sis for the declaration of fundamental
rights.
What are va told?

tlo, you can't look at the Attorney

(Seaexal * a affidavit any longer? that's not the reason for the
rights•
And what kind of limited judicial review can there
fo© if the citizen doesn't even know —- forget about the facts
underlying the action — doesn’t even know what the basis for
it is, the claim of right to set aside Fourth Amendment rights*
What are we told?
Shat basis is in secret doanmntes which, in a magic
wayc zoom to enlarge, as this ease goes or*,

And then, all of a sudden, there are
before the Court of Appeals; then, all
new envelopes filed before this Court?
secret, these envelopes, what's in

because whenever it suits the Executive's convenience,
they toil us and the courts openly, publicly, what are in
thzti but for the first time today — it's astounding to ms —
thi first feioa today wa wore told in this litigation that

in rboeo envelopes there i. • a memorandum from the head of the

66

I: literal Bureau of Investigation discussing prior wiretaps and
prior surveillances *
We never heard that before*

Wall, if that was so

secret, that it can now be discussed openly before this Court,
why weren't we told a long tins ago?
But what emerges, that if the basis for the deprivation
of fundamental rights are in these secret documents, which we
don't know and we can11 see, which we can't even challenge,
3: suggest that we have arrived now in 1972, we’ve already
arrived in 1984s

nothing could be more grotesque than the

situation in which we don’t even know what the basis for the
deprivation of fundamental rights is.

And what does this do?

It makes a mockery of any pretense of judicial review?
supposedly a safeguard.
Now, 3! would suggest that if sanctioned by this Court,
this warrantless general wiretapping of domestic — and I
utrasa that; there is no question here of the so-called foreign
intelligence exception discussed in Kate, discussed in Giordano.
This was not supposed to he a test case from the government's
point of view, from the Executive point of view, of the
«o-called -foreign exception *
£hey loudly, from one end of the country to the other,
v.. ■ -? httornsy Ssnaral gave speeches in which he talked about this

ru, in which ha said they are testing the domestic — their
wight to have cevsstic surveillance of so-called domestic

67
subversion.
All of a sudden they discovered fchay are cm very
shaky constitutional grounds.

So, at the last moment, they

try to infect this case wit!:; an inference of foreign affairs.
Well, I suggest to this Court that it is not so
difficult to disentangle one from the other ? that this , through
■out tb-a history of this country, has been the source of the
most serious eroding, the most serious eroding of constitutione
liberties.

At every turning point in the history of the nation

where there's been a challenge to fundamental constitutional
liberties, it has always been in the name of foreign agents»
When the first attack on Jefferson

and the Jeffer­

sonians emerged, what was it? They were French agents, and
therefore Alien and Sedition Act was all right, brush aside
the First amendment, pull them in and try them for sedition.
Wav?

Because they were French agents, foreign agents»
This Court .is well aware of the same development

around the Palmer ilaids, and a member of this Court was the
author of that famous document, Practices of the Department of
Justice, Justice Frankfurter, pointing out that one© again,
at the end of World War 2, the fear of foreign agents was the
thing that Intermingled into a cover to destroy — >.what? —
constitutional protections for American citizens.

For

t:mrl joxi citizens.
hacl this Court feat lived through and proudly emerged

60
from the period of ties re vll. know as the period of the
McCarthy hearings, tho period in which, once again, the fear,
the fears, the cold Sear of foreign, foreign elements was
need.

Why?

"i’o undermine the Fifth Amendment.

She- present- Solicitor General of the United States
wrote an important do extent on the erosion of the Fifth Amend­
ment during that period of time.
1 suggest we face that problem once again, and this
Court, as It did at each turning point in our history, must
st^nd resolute now to reject this effort to introduce this
spectre, this fear which erodes the fundamental rights of
all Americans, not just the three young men before this Court.
I think the seriousness of what the Executive is
asking for is reflected in the constitutional theory which
it now emerges full-blown, the theory that in the domestic
area there is an inherent power to do whatever the Executive
feels is necessary to be done.
I will not take time with this, because this Court
has over ax id over.again rejected that concept.

Only this

last June, in -Wow York Times, in the powerful opinion of the
late Justice Black, that doctrine which this Court, at the end
of the Civil War, calle;!, the most pernicious doctrine in

vt party Milligan, tho rrost pernicious doctrine that the
Executive, through its inherent powers, can — what?
constitutional groovnt&.tu

— suspend

Khsi*c- what they’re asking for here.

69
The power to suspend constitutions 1 guarantees.
Because they say.
V/o.

This is not the sootera of government which was

created in this country.

The system of government which was

created in this country is a system of limited powers.

Yes, il

ray not work as well , as Justice Frankfurter pointed out in
Youngstown , may not work as well as seise other government•
To be more efficient, you press a button in another government,
you don’t have to worry about warrants> you don’t have to worry
about courts; do what you want to do.
But that’s why this country was- set up in the way
it was*

And that’s why this Court sits, precisely to protect

this country and the citizens of this country from the
erosion of the fundamental constitutional values, which make

m strong and safe.
X have exhausted my time and would like to say on®

This W'-.;-\-f-rit in- :- recognised numerous types of

hensive search, 20 instances where the Congress of the United
States has provided for either warrantless searches or
searches conducted under warrants issued by persons other

Coimse-1 have cited the case of Abel vs. United States.
In fact, w© urged the Abel case in the Sixth Circuit Court.

And it's interesting to note that the ,Sixth Circuit Court,
•.e.x-xn referring to Al.-iHL, st&tc-d that Mr. libel was arrested by
a wcwrcaa which, in the opinion of the Court, was found to have
been lawfully issued- by a lawfully authorised magistrate, and
t: ->t awe matwriala seised at -the time of his arrest were held
loyally admissible as incident to that arrest.

1 would suggest, in this regard, that while the
warrant requirement, as it pertains to judicial proceedings,
criminal judicial proceedings especially, by and large are
issued by members of the Federal Judiciary.

There is a great

body of statute in this country which permits not only
warrantless searches, which we have alluded to in some of our
briefs, but warrants issued by persons other than Judicial
magistrates*

:

3tween so-called domestic and foreign intelligence.

Stow, counsel brought up the fact that in one of: oar
footnotes m referred to documents which we submitted to 'the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on & motior co augment the
record.

That case carae up# was tried before the Keith case#
/}

that’s the Jergc.son — or Smith case.

In Judge Keith8s

opinion# he refers in extenso to the opinion of Judge Ferguson.
And the way the matter arose was thist

In the Smith

case# which if; still pending before this Court# I understand#
wa made an in camera submission to the court# and X believe
that in camera subraission consisted of one sheet of paper#
which again was an incidental overhearing of the defendant
Smith.
it case that it wa^. a national security
intelligence) tap, and I think the record will disclose that
it’s the seme tap that is before this Court.
In that ee.y-3 wa urged that the information contained
in tee leg .-should not be disclosed# end its. disclosure would
;

v.w• interest and would be prejudicial to the national

'0

security.
;

1,1-l "lot arguo La that case# nor was the question

::.v . etfl by see court or by the defendant # that that case in~
a <;ww:.istie inteLI-lgr..:.;:® case.

Yet# in the determination

7?
of the Court ia the Hiath Circuit case, Judge Ferguson, he
Cola that the covounoovit war required to disclose, again as a
prelude to a taint hearing,, the overhearing on the- grounds
that

,

and. he used the team 13 separate tines, purely domestic

or wholly drives tic? organisation, or paralv domestic or
viiolly demeotic intelligence.

And yafc the only basis for that

fact determination was the in carter a submission of one sheet,
of paper which indicatsd the overhearing of the defendant
Smith5 s voxas.
For that reason, when the matter went before the
Ninth. Circuit, the government sought to augment the record and
to let the court view all of the overhearing of the surveillance
in question, to determine whether it was in fact wholly
domestic or purely domestic, or whether it was a wholly
romantic or purely domestic organization.

An examination

of iixe legs will disclose that it’s not a wholly domestic or
foreign ties exceeded its domestic ties.
And it was for that reason that ws made that offer
to the court in the ninth Circuit. And we would make that
offer to this Court, if the Court would like to view the record

which we submitted in that case.
Kow, with reference to why we footnoted the reference
tc the Smith casa, that footnote, that brief was drawn at the

tir.o that Judge Ferguson sought, a petition in this Court for
certiorari, before the <£« t irmination in the Ninth Circuit,

And

78
we acquiesced in that petition and sought to have this Court
baar both eases together, so that this Court could view the
in camera oufcmission v;hich was made at the Circuit Court level
stage.
1 take, raid I must take? some exception to the
dh&ractarisation of this case as an attempt on the part of the .
government to engage in electronic surveillance for the purpose
of observing the activities of dissident political groups.
‘fhe statute under which this government is operating
certainly prohibits that*
1 would also point out that this whole question of
electronic surveillance and what is disclosed, this Court must,
&.j

a coordinate branch of government, rely

on the integrity of the Executive Branch*

almost entirely
It was the Executive

Branch, through the then Solicitor General, who now sits on
this Court, who made the disclosure to this Court, end in each
instance where a motion is made under Rule IS it is the
.Integrity of the government that has to be relied upon, unless
this Court i~ going to fashion a rule which wdoul permit every
defendant to rummage all of the files of all of the

made, the government respond©..

When the motion .‘is

If the government is not to be

trusted to respond with respect to a motion under ‘Pule 16,
tlrvi, it should be expected, I assume from what counsel has
said, to respond honestly with respect to the nature of its

activities.
How, certainly, neither- this President nor any prior
President, to my knowledge,,

has authorised electronic

^surveillance to monitor the activities of an opposite political

group.
The only purpose is, as 1

stated2

one, to

obtain the on-going intelligence necessary to compete in the
area of foreign affairs, and the on-going intelligence necessary
for thin nation to protect itself against not only its foreign
foes but its domestic foes.
how, counsel Gossett has suggested that we might,
in this area, use the provisions relating to cases involving

sabotage or espionage.

I would submit that if if were a

sabotage case, or an espionage case, we certainly should invoke
the provisions of the statute.
But when we fee talking about the on-going intelligence
fraction ci

, there is no probable cause in many

caret, as that tom ia used in the criminal prosecutive sense.
few? 1 don't know that it's an appropriate analogy,

but certainly the protection of the President of the United

80

States against assassination is one aspect of the nation's
national security,

Heads of State haw bean assassinated to

bring clown govermer.ts.

h

simple cursory examination of the

Warren Commission Re-port will find# will disclose numerous
instances where tha Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
Secret Service were criticised for not having the on-going
intelligence necessary to provide adequate protection to the
President.
1 suggest again# with respect to the provisions of

article IV, Section 4, of the Constitution? which the Congress
las — execution of which the Congress has placed in the
President, there.) is no distinction in the consfcitutiona1
feitutes passed pursuan t thereto with
respect to the Presidential authority as it relates to
invasion or civil insurrection.
Both require on-going intelligence.

Because without

that intelligence# the President cannot make an appropriate
decision.
■ as the Court held in the Kennedy case, the

Constitution isn't & suicide pact.,

The President can't wait

until the moment of invasion or insurrection to start putting
t gather a counter-intelligence function.

The President must

have this information if he * s to carry out his responsihilitie
