ER. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER‘

We will hear argument first

today in j. 5035, Prank Johnson against Louisiana.
Mr. Buckley, you may proceed when you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. BUCKLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLANT
MR. BUCTLEYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is an appeal from the Louisiana Supreme
Court decision which confirmed appellant's conviction and
sentence for the crime of armed robbery.
The two important issues considered by the Louisiana
Supreme Court and. before this Court on review are:
First, whether the seizure of appellant resulting
from a warrantless nighttime entry into his home violated the
Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and
seizures.
And secondly, whether the Louisiana jury system,
which extends the rule of unanimity to some defendants but

'

denied it to appellant, amounts to a denial of equal protec­
tion.

And siso whether a non-unanimous verdict is

constitutionally permissible in light of the due process
requirement that guilt be established beyond a reasonable
doubt.
m >8t important facts of this

4
case are as follows:
Before daybreak the appellant, a young black eitiru .
...

Orleans detectives, all’ who

were armed with shotguns, who had entered Frank Johnson's home
without, a warrant.

After a complete search of the home, and

an additional interrogation, Frank Johnson was booked for the
crime of anted robbery.
Three days later appellant was part of a general
line tip, that is, a number of armed robbery suspects were put
in the lineup and viewed by a number of: armed robbery victims.,
The person who had been robbed four weeks prior to
appellantia arrest identified Frank Johnson. This parson,
however, was not the one for which the appellant had been
arrested and booked.

The lineup identification was subsequent!

used at the trial.
Pretrial hearings were held wherein appellant
challenged, bis arrest and his detention during the lineup.
Appellant was tried for the crime of armed robbery,
which, since 1966 in Louisiana, is a crime punishable from 5
to 99 years, without the benefit of pardon or parole.
The primary evidence against the appellant was the
eyewitness identification of the victim.

The jury verdict

was 9 to:: guilty, and 3 for not guilty, which, in Louisiana,
constitutes conviction.
Appellant won eubsequenily sentenced to 35 years at

5
hard labor at Angola, Louisiana, where he has served four of
tb.ese 3 5 years,
v:j

: r-.r brief, Louisiana states its policy of never

obtaining warrants in cases of this nature.

This policy is

ir. direct conflict with this Court!s consistent position that
police must, whenever possible, obtain judicial approval of
searches and seisures»
Applying either the warrant test or even the
reasonable search test, the facts of this case requires a
finding of unreasonable search and an unlawful seizure.
hi the pretrial hearing the police testified that
there was no reason why they did not secure warrants,
the State show any emergency, such

Nor did

the warrantless nighttime intrusion into appellant’s home.
inconvenience to the police.

The only reason behind

.Louisiana5s policy of not securing warrants was firmly rejected
by ih.Ls Court In Johnson vs, Louisiana, and has been adhered
to sines.
"

is precisely this type of case which shows the

necessity to require the police to adhere to the Fourth
Jtr.sndment warrant requirement,
rased upon information the police possessed at the
time of arrest, it: is doubtful whether an arrest warrant could
have

cv :;odf. because the police in this instance did not

ki.ow the date or the place of the alleged offense.

On the
police

:

!

no rcionable information, the

chair own dsfccMn.f. .ration of probable, cause, they

made the:: r onn deterrdnution that they didn't need a warrant,
and, further, that they could enter a home at night; even in
light of ti:& Louisiana requirement that .a special warrant is
needed for nighttime searches.
Kell, Mr. Buck lay, as sinning there, was probable
cause,

is there some case in this Court that holds that there

is a constitutional requirement for a warrant in connection with
an arrest as distinguished from a search?
CR. BUCKLEY:
l.c, Justice finite.
cases which

There is no case directly on point,

However, underlying in the thrust of all the

ace alluded to the exceptions to the requirement,

by implication this Court is indicating that a warrant is
required prior to entering a home.
Q

Even for the purpose of arrest?

MR. BUCKLEY:

Even for

not so much the arrest,

Your Honor, as it is the entry into the home.

Once the

police officers went there and made the entry, they are conductin
a search; it’s no longer —

But you wouldn’t be —

But yon wouldn't be making the same argument if

There is an additional requirement when one enters a

is the exception to the warrant.
And in this case also the police officers testified
that they planned not only to seize appellant in his home, but
to search the entire horse for evidence; and, in fact, they did.
These certainly'are not reasons to avoid obtaining a
warrant, but, as has been said in this Court before, in Agnello
vs« United States, they are clearly compelling reasons why the
should
police/seek a magistrate and attempt to convince him whether a
warrant is authorized,
Some additional factors peculiar to this case, which
shows the danger of police probable cause, is that appellant
was never tried for the alleged offense which formed the
alleged basis of the police probable cause.

And the probable

cause for the arrest of appellant was not reviewed by any
cour^t until weeks after his arrest,

Any others?
Other than his person being placed in a
lineup, he would never have, been charged for the crime for which
he was convicted, Your Honor.

It. was that lineup and the

lentification; the evidence used fro® that lineup
was the major evidence at the trial.

Once he was identified,

ia fact that was the trial, Your Honor, as has been held in
this Court before.

But they didn't seize any guns or —

HR. BUCKLEY:

They went there looking for a gun,

but
Q

*— anything like that?

MR. BUCKLEY:

No?

— there was no seizure of a gun.

However, to pick up your point. Your Honor, and which
X'£v Justice Unite indicated, there is no doubt that a warrant
would have been necessary to have seized the cun.

It is our

position that seizure of a person is a greater intrusion than
to go there to search and seize tangible evidence similar to
that of a gun.
)

Well, what you're saying is that a man, a person

er be arrested at his home without a warrant? that’s
what it adds up to, isn't it?

9

HS. BUCKLEY:

' : Ln '.hose emergencies which this

Err

Court has found aa an exception ; for example, hot pursuit.
Or if he’s committi ig a crxr.s inside the house, and which the
police, have inov;ledge of it, and the crime is being committed
in their y: a cer.ee at that

:

-.

For example, if ha’s committing

an asnau.lt on another police officer or firing at the police.
But, other than that, it is true that there is no
entry into the home without a. warrant.
In regard to the jury issue, appellant asserts that
the divided jury verdict was in violation of .the equal protec­
tion provision of the Fourteenth amendment.
•ihe Louisiana jury system is unique in that it permits
three types

: jury verdicts:

in capital cases, ’ a jury of 12,.

in which all 12 must concur to render a verdict; in offenses
similar to arpellant's, those necessarily punishable by hard
labor, there is a jury of 12, in which only 9 have to concur to
render a verdict? and then in cases which may be punishable by
hard labor, the jury is composed of 5, again all 5 of which
must concur in order to render a verdict.
Bo we have greater offenses and leaser offenses in
which the unanimity rule is required; but not in appellant's
case, which are very serious felonies.
Louisiana’s only reason for this difference is to
r-.adue® cost :od expedite matters and is not a rational basis
to extend ths significant benefits of unanimity to seme

3.0
defendants and to

deny it to aopeplant’s class*

There is no

compiling ctote interest to v ilch they can withhold the
unanimity 'benefit to appall.?nt and extend it to others.
te% -ismpia ot the -prejudicial effect is that in
capital crime an Individual can be paroled within ten and a half
years after sentence, whereas in armed robbery an individual can
get up to ft: years*
of parole or pardon.

Appellant received 35 years, with no chance
And they are in the same penitentiary!

The unanimity requirement performs a significant role
in protecting minority groups from discriminatory application
in criminal law by the majority.

This of course assumes that

members of the minority defendant group are represented on the
jury.
F.r the past 100 years this Court has rendered
numerous decisions to astute that members of appellant’s race
are not entirely excluded from the jury panel.

A divided jury

verdict may accomplish* in a subtle, indirect manner* what
this Court has ruled cannot be done directly? and that is
excluding members of appellant’s race from the jury.
Trace wore three black male jurors

on appellant's

jury, but the record does not reflect which jurors voted not
guilty.
For various reasons in a capital case the majority
juroro may oersuade tha majority to return a verdict of
r/oi.oo

with'./ah capit::!

ishmant, or guilty of a lesser

included crime,

This can

accomplished because of the

unanimity rule in a capital oato in. Louisiana, which requires
the; majority jurors to take

sons: iteration of the minority’s

viewpoint.
;■■■ rv'S .uar, this is precluded in the case in which
.appellant

tried, wherein the majority can reject and not

consider the minority viewpoint.
Take, for example, in view of the harsh penalty
involved in this crime of armed robbery in. Louisiana, the same
minority in appellant's case may have been prepared and capable
to persuade the minority to return a verdict of a lesser crime,
3ay, for example, simple robbery, especially in view of the
facts of this case.
But, as was true in this case, the divided jury
verdict will result in 97 percent of the trials in precluding
the. considerations and viewpoints of the minority jurors.
Divided jury verdicts permit the elimination of the
central jury functions which this Court stressed and under­
scored in Williams vs. Florida.

MR. BUCKLEY:

— 1 checked the official ballots

subsequent to the last argument, and there is no indication
made on that, Year Honor.
Ai-.©,, by excluding the viewpoint of three minority
jurors, it is very doubtful whether this verdict represents a
common-sense judgment of the jury panel, the 12 jurors.
Furthermore, appellant‘s conviction by a divided jury
is a denial of the due process requirement that the State
prove defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,

Yes „

MRS, KORNS:

that the police may enter any dwelling

to make an arrest if, first, they announce their authority and
purpose, end then if they're denied entry they may break the
doors.
In our brief, Louisiana took the position, and takes
the position, that both — that our jury is all right under the
l b Amendment and that our statutory laws permitting arrest
ir- the home without warrant are valid under the Fourth
Amendment.
rowaver, in the alternative, in this oral argument,
I'd -.ike to advance, thin further alternative arguments

that if

•]«

tiiis Court should. hold that \ 9~to~I2 jury is not permissible
under the bl hh Ameob ^eox., arr! -irresfe in a home without
warrant is not valid under the fourth Amendment, that,
nevertheless, both of those actions are valid under the due
process clause of the Fourteenth amendment, and that the State
should be permitted to follow them even though the Federal
Governmant cannot.
And 1 say this for this reasons

1 realise that in

making this argument I have to ask the Court to — not really
to overrule, but to modify in these two areas its holding that
it has gradually been developing during these past years as it
selectively incorporated various guarantees of the Ball of
Eights into the Fourteenth /amendment.
Along with it, this Court, I think, has also, up
until the present time, fairly much held that once — that
although

it has never held — a majority of this Court has

never held that the Bill of Rights was automatically
incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment? however, I think that
thi- majority of this Court has increasingly been holding that
once this Court: finds that a guarantee in the Bill of Rights
applies t

tbs States through the Fourteenth Amendment,, then

every facet, every constitutional standard of the — the
constitutional standards applying against the State Governments
anc the Federal Government are the same; X believe I’m right

there

16
de •-, I was very i nch impressed, in restudying this
case for r a/: i m.a-vc, with Mr» Justice Fertas8 concurring opinio
ii*. Duncan, sad that’s why I say, although our primary position

is that a roiv-unar.inious jury is pa.rtiissib.le under the Sixth
ikaand-uant because of everything we set out in our brief, the
unanimity principle being deleted, the fact that 4 of the
Original 13 States had majority verdicts,, the fact that many
common-lav jurisdictions with juries presently have majority
verdicts, ouch as Scotland, England went to it in 1967, and so
forth» So our first: position is that a maj ority-verdlet jury
i-3 valid under fchs Sixth amendment»
In the alternative we say that if this Court should
hold that it is not —- was not the intent of the Framers, that
tV : Federal Court use jurors which returned less-than-unanimous
verdict- v-.y, nevertheless, alternatively take the position that
there is nothing in the majority verdict that violates the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and we ask this
Cour 'C, ss? rlr» Justice Portas very, very intelligently pointed
out in hie concurring opinion in Duncan, a jury trial is not a
principle cf justice, like self-incrimination and

a

First

Amendment right, it*s rather a system of procedure«
And he pointed out that he thought that if this Court
itslated that the States and the Federal Government be, with
cVj.vt

to every single detail, identical, that na would have

r\.; Lc.ifcy,

that

e would —- it would go against our

17
principle of Federalism.- that it would prevent us from being able
to try out one thing in one jurisdiction and another thing in
another juv 1;; Sictico., an-5 he thought that this would have a va ,
adverse effect on our whole principle of Federalism.

And I

think Mr. Justice, the late Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out in

hi..3 dissenting opinion in Mill lares this very sarae thing.

He

said that he thought that this Court should reexamine the
whole principle of incorporation, because he said if it didn't,
that he thought there was going to be a leveling and rigid
process that was going to set in, making all the 30 States,
with their different problems —* and this is - - I am going to
make the same argument in our Fourth Amendment argument about
arrest without warrant.
For instance, think of the State police.

In Orleans

Parish alone, the police make a thousand arrests a week.
are the peace-keepers.

They

Unlike the federal police agents, such

as the FBI and the narcotics agents, and these special agents
who have very limited areas, who don’t cruise the city in
police cavr, who don’t have to pick up runaway children,
•that’s arr

thing. But peace-keeping police, like we have in

Orleans Parish, why, I had a case in the Court of Appeals
last year whore they made this same argument about a warrant
being needed, when the case involved a mother telling the
police that her child was a runaway, and she had good reason
to believe that her child was staying at X child's house.

18

the. police wc-pt there and knocked on the door and
ashed for ti.e child in question, ar t when the little qiri of
the totse

the??-- were no adults in the house ~~ said the qi: 1

in quest*.pa

the tuna*-:ay girl wasn't*t there, the police went in

and picked her up.

The argument was made that they should have

gone to the police station and spent two days swearing out &
warrant.
And this is just one of the many examples of what I
2Ps;'g the difference between a State Police, which has the

problem of heaping the peace, and the federal agents which
have an entirely different tele, a highly specialised role,
where they probably have time to go and swear out a warrant,
because the man they*re pursuing is maybe a bank robber who is
crossing State lines, or something like that.
But — so, in this reargument before) this Court,
there again I think that history shows that an arrest within a
house with-cut a warrant, way back to the Seventeenth Century in
England, in Semayne*s Case, on probable cause — on probable
cause the police have always been able historically to go into

a homo and make an arrest.
Q

Are you familiar with this Court's decision in

tvercon v\ .%yoat for instance?

MRS. K.O£<NS:

Well, I gather from reading this Court- s

opinion in. Coolidge vt_ te Hampshire this suaosr,. 2 know that
that’s a majority opinion, without passing on the question,
pointed out that — I think, Mr. Justice Stewart, you wrote
the opinion

wherein you thought that to allow a warranties?

entry into : hero world conflict with the Fourth Amendment.
But my answer to that is —
Q

No, t was asking you about Warden v. Hayden„ -

IBB. KORNS:

Q

X am familiar with that.

~~ which involved an arrest.

MRS. KORNS:

Right.

Yes.

The Court, of course, never squarely said it did

there?
ins. KORNS:

Nothing, absolutely!

And from indica­

tions of what I've studied in other cases, I wc-uJd very much
doubt that the three jurors voting not

who hadn't joined

the guilty vote, doesn’t mean that they thought they were not
guilty, as my brief points out, if they had sat there long
enough there9 s a 95 percent chance they would have reached
unanimity,
But experience shows that they were probably a
mixture ok black end white, those three.

They might have been

all white, even, or they might, of course, have been black?

inzb there'e no definite pattern.

cmj,, that, i think Your Honors must have read in
Tircifc Magnaio’O: u&nrzv. how in the Slack Panther trial in Orleans

Pariah tar'-. .Paly rhere rare ter Macks, two whites;

unanimous,

not •guilty,
Yury Nekton got a hung jury in Oaklandr and when the
jrrry came in, he raid, "Ah, trie proves that having one Negro
on a. jury insures j?.3 a fair trial.*
A white worttr,.

But who hung the jury up?

A white x;o:ean Yung the jury, not the sole black

woman on the jury*
Q

Well, let's get back to this case,

MRS. KORHS$

Yes, Your Honor,

It was just because

Mr. Buckley was arguing this point that X brought this out.
o

Well, I fail to see where it has any place in

the case at all *
MRS„ KOKHS;
you.

Well, I agree with you.

X agree with

X agree with you.
It was just in answer to appellant's arguments that

1 wanted to point, out that I didn't think the fact that —

Q

Kay I go back to one other points

Has a warrant

ever been issued for Johnson?

MRS. KOKHSS
Q

No, sir.

Hot until this day?

kWh, Koms s

No.,

Well, 3: frankly admit, X know front

errariarcr ?,v; gMJ.ce ...ever swear ert an arrest warrant in
.r MM.hr,

M-as the persor ir a fugitive, and they can't

24

i&nediately arrest hi*. # and so they swear out the warrant to
send to another pariah or to send to -another State.

But

never, in a ease like this, do the police **** they always re.lv

c,-n

Louisiana's; Col: of Criminal Procedure, Article 213.

And.

they just never think of swearing out a warrant, because they
lave this statutory authority to arrest without a. warrant.
St( are there any questions the Court would like to

ask me further, then?
:: Ml rest.

Q

Shank you,, Your Honors.

Mrs. Korns«

:h£. KORNS?

j

Yes, Your Honor?

What was the rule of coaon law at the time of

the adoption of our Constitution with respect to the need for a.

warrant for arrest?
lit . j>» KORNS t t’fee rule at common law was# as X see it,
Mr. Justice E-ahncuist, under Seiaaynefs Casa in England# that
there was :uo need for a warrant at all to enter a house.
cvv-.aon la-

At

-• Kara never has been a need7 if -*~ there has to be

probable cause, of course.

But in Semayne's Case, they state very clearly that
- that an arrest can be mado ir. a horae

v...,'.;>ra is no need no

with or win!-out a warrant, based on probable cause.
the Kag.UwK eontmiit«tors point ©it
hnr in ti n

crivtu

in

'.n-enn. . ,

cn.n-.

And all

that the rule that a man's

: re • s an execution to this rule which
'

t .treatr

that no mat can

--

that no man's

houB2 is e. castle against the King.
S o - a e tu a 11;/, —
o

Well? it Might have been just exactly that rule

of common law that the Fourth Amendment was adopted • to overrule
ier 51 that correct?
iriw. KORNS?

I don’t believe so, Mr. Justice Stewart.

1 believe sir Fourth Amendment was adapted to overrule the
Writs of Assistance and the general warrants --Q

The general warrants --

KRR. K02K3

from this.

— which were completely different

Wow, general warrants and writs of assistance were

issued by the King? the writs of assistance — a writ of
assistance was given by the King to one of his favorites , to
run for the life of the King? it was a document enabling him
to arrest whomever, at hie whim( bo wanted to.

There didn’t

have to be any probable cause, there didn’t have to be anything
Sc how can you possibly liken Louisiana's Code ■—

Louisiana's statute permitting arrest based on reasonable
cause to a writ of assistance, which was a blanket writ in
which no cause at all had to exist?

Q

Well, I don't think anybody has likened that.

£%. :;opt, perhaps - you

[Laughter. 'j
MKB. KORNSs

No, but that’s what I say.

It coulcin81 be that.

26

bit:; that’s why, you ask me if possibly the Fourth
lum.-Zusmt

w--'v

dr aim up to

prevent the rule, the common-law

rule then existing, from being in existence in England? and I
a.;/ answer

tfcini

is absolutely no.

I think it was directed

at the writ", of assistance, which were in derogation of the
common

la . .

that the

os:

And tiev the Fourth ihr.andSRsnt was meant to insure
on law existed in this country and that general

•.>.

,

warrants in isrogifitiorx of the common law, and arrests and
imprisonments without cause could not exist.

Is there anything in the Louisiana law that would

prevent t«i a police from putting out a house-to-house search to
cover a whole neighborhood?
C-n the suspicion that somebody in that neighborhood

committed a crime?
.■ill. KOFHS s Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, the Code
Article says that they can only go to a house where they have
reasonable cause to believe the person to be.
Q

So —

They have reasonable cause to believe that the

guy4a in this square block.
HL.h, KORNSs

I don’t think they could go into a house

then. They have to have reasonable cause —

j

Well, hew would they test it under Louisiana

law us to now much information this officer had?
MRS. KOKJS t Fell, they would have to test it the same
v.v,\ they tout any unreasonable search, it{s by a motion to

27

suppress.

Q

Kelly yen could»*t motion to suppress the body?

HRS, KORNS :

Well, in other words, you mean if the

man v?a.s illegally arrested ana no evidence wa:? seised? that I
don’t know h- a you would test it..

How do you test, any ™“

hew do you test anything —
Q

How would you test the right of the policeman

to coise into his home at dawn?

1.2? 3«. KORNS : Well, of course. we tala

wo took the

position that — the accused did not raise this point in the
District Court? he raised it for the first time on appeal —
Q
Court?

Well, could he have raised it in the District

X asked the question:
MP3. KOP.HSs

Yes.

How?
We 11, he raised ~~ in the Supreme

Court he argued that he wanted to suppress his pretrial
identification.
o

Well, how could he have raised it!

MRS. KORNS: By a motion to suppress
However, I — we take the position that no court has
aver held that a. pretrial identification is s ©mething subject
to a motion to suppress,

o

Ky point is, how can ho tost the validity of

the policed a :.v- * s information that he tad probable cause to go
in his home and arrest him?

KCi&iS:

Unless he £i; os a motion to ~~ -unless h

prop esrty has been seised , or 1
Q

Well, there ‘ s no v?ay he

MRS. KORNS::

MRS . KC iNS:

He could f lie a

I imagine* i .it generally, you see, the reason I :n pusssled by
this, Mr, Justice -—
Q

You imagine; but, you see, this —- to mo this

is a fundamental right j to come and pick me up , not only in
'le midcila < -, the right or at dawn, but at any time.
MLS. KORNS: We 13.r he can — now that I'm thinking o
it, he car ask for a preliminary hearing immediately.

Ha can

cv't to be brought before a magistrate and have a preliminary
hearing immediately, in which the State has to show probable
cause to hold him,
Q

Yes, right,

MRS. KORNS:

That$ s — I'm sorry — that's what he

can do, certainly.
So, if the Court would not have further questions,
then, thank you, Your Honors,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mrs. Korns.

Mr. Buckley, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. BUCKLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, BUCKLEYs

I just wart to comment on one thing.

Mr, Justice Marshall, it is that we got into this
case two weeks subsequent tc the arrest, and we did proceed

by way of habeas corpus up and down the Louisiana Supreme Court
and in &z.ch instance it was denied; each time referring to the
authority of the police under that arrest statute.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE 8URGS-R: Thank you, Hr. Buckley.
Thank you , Mrs. Korns.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon.- at 10:43 a.ra., the case was submitted.]
