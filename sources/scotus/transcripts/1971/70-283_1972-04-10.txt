MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Browne, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD A. BROWNE, ESO*,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER .
MR. BROWNEs

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;
This matter evolves from a petition for writ of habeas
corpus, which was filed by the present respondent, Robert
Williams, in 196), in the Federal District Court for the
District of Connecticut.
Mr. Williams had been arrested in the city of
Bridgeport, Connecticut, in October of 1966.

He had been

charged with a number of State criminal violations relative to
his possession of a quantity of heroin, a pistol, and a machete.
In those State prosecutions, Mr. Williams had filed motions to
suppress those i-.ems, to prevent them from being used as.
evidence in his .state trial.

These motions

Mr. Williams was subsequently convicted.

v;ere denied.

He took an appeal to

the Supreme Court for the State of Connecticut, which affirmed
his conviction and likewise ruled that the items which had bean
taken from his possession by a Bridgeport police officer had
not been taken illegally or in any violation of his
constitutional rights.

4
Thereafter, Mr. Williams filed the instant petition
in the District Court for the District of Connecticut. That
court ruled likewise f that his rights had not been violated,
and affirmed the prior decisions of the Connecticut court.
Thereafter the matter was appealed to the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

Initially that court

again affirmed the lower court, the District Court ruling by a
divided court, 2 to 1 decision, the respondent thereafter
petitioned for a rehearing, and the rehearing en banc was
granted? the resi It of which was a per curiam decision which
reversed the lower court, the prior court decision, and ruled
in fact that the Bridgeport police officer had no constitutional
basis or no va-lii reason for removing certain items from Mr.
Williams3 possession.

1 thin! that factually the facts are not in great
detail, it is a relatively simple factual situation, in that
on the early morning of October 30th of 1966 a Bridgeport
police sergeant by the name of Oohn Connolly, who was a veteran
of twenty years’ service on the Bridgeport police department,
was on duty, on-patrol duty alone in the City of Bridgeport
in a particular cure a of the city which was noted for a high
incidence of crime.
At that time he was in a gasoline station at the
intersection of two public streets in the city, he met and he
h. ,a a convarsati.cn with a person whom he knew, who was known to

5

him.

That particular person indicated to him that there was

another person seated in an automobile nearby on a street known
as Hamilton Street, and that that person who, incidentally,
developed to ba ::he respondent Robert Williams,- that he had
drugs and that he had a pistol in his waistband.
Thereafter the officer proceeded out of the gasoline
station, across the street, Hamilton Street.- to the particular
automobile.

Ha knocked on the window of the car.

the respondent t

side.

open the car door,

He ashed

In response thereto, Mr.

The officer immediately placed one hand in through the

open car window, inside the respondent’s coat, which was open,
and directly onto the handle of a pistol, which he seised and
removed from the respondent.
Apparently the coat was open, he apparently didn’t
touch Mr. Williams' body at all, other than the inside of his
coat.

The revolver was fully loaded.

He then proceeded to

place Mr. Williams under arrest; advised him of his constitu­
tional rights relative to statements.

Then a further search

was conducted of the person of Mr, Williams, which disclosed a
quantity of heroin at two locations on his person? and a search
was conducted of the automobile there on Hamilton street, which

where Mr. Williams had been seated.

overruled.

They were

The matter was affirmed by the Connecticut Supreme

Court and the Unated States District Court reversed, in a
per curiam opinion,from which ray client, the Warden, in
actuality the State of Connecticut, petitioned for certiorari,
which was granted.
The State, the Warden, petitioner, in the various
courts in which - his has been presented, has tried to urge
that the issues here be framed in the dual consideration which
is presented within the decision of the Terry case, more
particularly at yaga 20 of the Terry case.
I think it goes without saying that it * s the position
of the petitioner' that many statements contained within the
decision of Terry ys,. United States

[sic; Ohio], both within

the majority decision and the concurring decision, are uniquely
applicable to the

factual situations in the case of Robert

Williams.
In tha Terry decision, at page 20 of the reported
decision, the Chief Justice urges that a dual consideration
.must be inquired into in determining, in this type of a situa
tion, where an officer is making a self-protection search and

the first consido ration is whether the officer's actions were
justified at their inception; and the second consideration is

wh

■ -\i

:

activities or actions were relative or related

?

reasonably in scops to the circumstances which justified the
interference.
X would respectfully submit that the actions of the
officer. Officer John Connolly, in leaving the gasoline station,
after he received this particular information, which, as I
indicated, was from a person whom he knew by name and who he
had had prior conversations with, and whom he believed to be a
person who was trustworthy and reliable, that his actions in
leaving the gas station, on the basis of that information, and
going over to the automobile to make the investigation, a
further investigation, were completely justified.

I would point out that in most of the reported cases,
X think that most of the cases that X have read, which relate
to street investigations in which an officer receives informa­
tion and then proceeds to make some sort of an investigation,
I think the great majority of those Ccises involves situations
where the officer receives his information from someone who is
unknown to him, from a person who comes up to him and relates
to him that some unusual activity or some type of criminality
is taking place and then he makes his decision to proceed or
not to proceed, or whatever he is going to.do.
I think that it*s of considerable importance here.
If that was not the situation here, this iv not the situation
where a person, who is a stranger to an officer, comes up and
indicates information to him, on the basis of which he makes his

8
investigation.

1' think it's relevant because, in the case of an

unknown or unnamod individual, the individual, after giving the
information, can go about his ways and quite possibly never foe
located by the officer again? whereas, this is not th© situation
here, the office : knew this individual, knew him by name, and
of course if the information had been incorrect he could havecome back and located that person officially and inquire as to
why it had been made to him»
The officer arrives at the side of the car in which
Mr. Williams was seated, the window is lowered, and 1 think
that then he had to make the decision which, in all probability,
is the crux of this particular case, and that is whether or
not he was justified in reaching his hand in through the open
window and into the waist of the respondent, where he round,
came in contact with the handle of th© revolver and removed it.
Q

Did the officer testify that the man’s coat was

open?
MR. BROiSE:

Yes.

That appears at several places

within the Appendix, in hi© testimony.

I don’t have the pages

right in front or me, but it does appear within the Appendix
on several occasions that the coat was open, it was not buttoned.

fee, he was, sir.

X can't make out from the record whether those

are concurrent sentences or consecutive ores.
MR. BERWME:

He received a sentence on the possession

of the heroin of not less than three and not more than six
years in the Stage's prison? received one-year sentence*, which
was consecutive, on the possession of the pistol without a
permit? and an additional one-year sentence on the possession
of the machete, both of which are added to the maximum
sentence in the State of Connecticut,so his effective sentence
was not loss tha: three and not more than eight years on all
of the charges.

That was the total sentence.

Again, it's the position of the petitioner here that
the crux of the base amounts to, or evolves to whether or not
the particular officer was justified in - reaching into the
automobile and placing his hand on the handle of the revolver
and removing it.
And again we would submit that it was a decision
which the great majority of trained police officers in that
circumstance, at that time, would undoubtedly have done.
0

Do you, in this case, question, Mr. Browne, the

availability of federal habeas corpus to attack the —
MR. BROWNE:
Q

Ho, I do not, Mr. —

—- admissibility of evidence in a State trial?

HR. SiKbtJNE:

No, we have never contested that.

We

10

have never conteeted the availability of that particular
remedy.
X would remark that this proceeding today is the
seventh time in which this particular point has been
judicially reviewed by a court or courts.

In other words, it

was reviewed three times within the State system.

It was

reviewed, prior to today, three times in the Federal system,
and this today makes the seventh time in which it has been
reviewed judicially.
Q

h,

the Federal system, by the District Court and

then twice by the Court of Appeals?
MR. BROWNE:
for the second Circuit.

Twice by the Circuit Court of Appeals
And then today makes it the fourth

time on this.
Q

Mr. Browne, --

MR. BRCWNE:
Q

Yes, sir.

you said earlier you felt the crux was whether

there was sufficient cause for reaching into the car? but am I
wrong, looking at the Appendix A to the petition, curiam
phrases it "whether there was any other sufficient cause",

•

that is, in addition to probable cause for arrest, "for reaching
into Williams’ waistband".
MR. BROWNE:
his waistband.

0

That’s correct? into the car and into

In other words, he reached into -**
That's what it says, “for reaching into Williams'

11
waistband» H
MR. BE ."-JNE:

Into the waistband, that's correct»

Now, again, quite clearly —
Q

Well, wasn't the window up'?

Didn't the officer

ask
MR. BROWNEs

Williams rolled the window down.

The

window was up.
0

He was asked to?

MR. BROWNE:
Q

He was asked to open the door —

Yes.

MR. BROWNE:

— and he, in response, rolled the

window down, and the officer then placed his hand into the
automobile and right onto the handle of the revolver.
Q

Well, is this implied, that there was sufficient

cause for reaching into the car?
MR. BROWNE:

But not until —

I assume that the — no — I assume

that the implication of the per curiam sentence is that there
was no sufficient cause to reach into the automobile or into
the waistband.

I think it’s a corollary that if he had no

cause to reach into the waistband, he probably didn't have any
cause to reach into the car.
Q

Do you think if goes beyond that, and suggests

that there was no probable cause to go over and tap on the
window?
ME. BROWNEs

Well, unfortunately, that's the way it

12
reads, and I have tried to frame the issues in the way that X
have*

Unfortunately, in the one or two sentences in the

ciebis ion by the teccncl Circuit Court of Appeals,, they did not
indicate %-r thin

:hat decision just, whether they were saying

that there was n> probable cause for him to investigate
further# or then ; was no probable cause for him to — or
sufficient cause.

I should say, for him to leave the gasoline

station and go over to the automobile, or whether they were
merely saying that he may have been justified in going over to
the automobile? but, in any event, there was no sufficient
cause for him to reach in and remove the pistol.

2 think that that is — it's difficult because of the
way they frame their opinion.

They don't say necessarily

whether they're including the fact that his investigation was
improper or not,

Although 1 feel, and my brother may

correct me/ he, nt least in his brief, has not briefed, to
my knowledge, any claim that it was improper or imprudent by
the officer to nuke this investigation in the manner that ha
did.
I think the claim is that once he got to the auto­
mobile ha should not have inserted his hand in and onto the
handle of —

Well, Judge Friendly, X gather, in dissenting,

the panel dissenv.

It seems that **- that is, in

13
riRo BROv'NEs Thiit is correct.
0

He seems to indicate that it turned on whether

or not he should have approached the car, he didn't have
probable cause fcr arrest, but was he justified in approaching
the car on the basis of the information from the unnamed
informer?
MS. BROWNE:

I don't think that —* my recollection of

the opinion of Judge Friendly, the dissenting opinion, I don't
think he ever cones out and says categorically that Connollyshould never have left the gasoline station and gone over to
respondent's car.
Q

\

Well, I'm just looking at the sentence:

"Almost*

everything must therefore turn on what the unnamed informer
said, and the value of his statement", and then ha goes on,
in his judgment did not satisfy the requirements of Draper and
those other cases.
MS. BROWNE:

Right.

My recollection of the dissent

of Judge Friendly was, he held that there was not a sufficient
basis for a stop.

Now, where the stop was, whether the stop

was — well, he actually, obviously, didn't stop Mr. Williams
from proceeding an any manner, because Mr. Williams wasn't
proceeding any place, he was just sitting there; so that there
v/asn't a stop in the idea that he stopped his momentum or he
stopped his walking or he stopped his activity.
Q

So it simply has to be on these facts, whether

14
he was justified in approaching the car at all?
MR, BROWNEWhether it’s justified, first, in
approaching the car? obviously, if he wasn't approaching —
Q

Well, surely, if he was justified in approaching

the car, then I expect no one could say that he then reached
for the gun in open view?
MR. BROWNE: .Well, that would he tr.y position, that —
Q

Well, then, it does have to narrow down to

whether he was justified in approaching the car at all?
MR. BROWNE:

Right.

And again I have taken that

into — tried to frame it in two particular issues, as I
indicated, under the law in Tarryz

on©, whether he was

justified in leaving the gasoline station, walking across
Hamilton Street to the automobile; and then, two, once you
put him next to the automobile and the window goes down, is
he secondarily justified in reaching in to remove the
individua19 s pis to1.
Q

Is it clear, in your view, that he received

the information *— or I'll put it this way:

where you say this

record shows that the police officer received the tip.
MR, BROWNE:

Well, the Appendix, I think the testimony

of the officer is clear that he received the tip in the
gasoline station

Now, there was a hearing by Judge Clarie

in the United States District Court to clear up what he
coni, fderecl to be a discrepancy between the officer's earlier

15
testimony and the officer’s testimony in the Superior Court
motion to suppress and in the trial, and there was a hearing
for. that specific purposef at the conclusion of which, in this
memorandum of decision, the judge expressly accepts and
finds the findings of the Superior Court to foe completely
correct, and he adopts them as a findings of the United States
District Court.
So I don't think that, as far as this Court is
concerned, that there is any question at this time but that he
did receive that information in the gasoline station in the
manner in which he testified and acted accordingly.
Q

Mr. Browne, —

MR. BROWNE;
Q

Yes, sir.

— following up on Justice Stewart's question

of a moment ago, if this crime took place in 1966 and the
ultimate decision of this Court should foe to hold that the
evidence was;.improperly seised in 1972, I take it you would
agree that if the purpose of the ruling is to discipline the
police, it. would haves a somewhat attenuated effect if it
was handed down six years after the event,
ORo BROWNE: Well, there’s no question about it.
the case of Officer Connolly,

1

In

happen to know that he has since

retired, ho is no longer a member of the Bridgeport police
department, it tion would have no effect on Officer Connolly,
obviously.

16
The effect that it’s going to have on other brother
police officers? if Your Honor please, 1 think it’s going to
deter them from making any investigation in the streets when
they receive information, unless they can categorically
substantiate a fueling. that they can categorically substantiate
t

that they are ne ., going to .be criticised, or that any evidence
which their investigation discloses is not going to be — is
not going to be

ruled — suppress the evidence in subseauent

proceedings,
If anything, 1 think it’s going to substantially
deter proper police protection, and 1 would -— X hesitate, but
I would stats that the Supreme Court for the State of
Connecticut, rather than indicating or making any claim that
Officer Connolly acted with:insolence or acted imprudently,
that they went cut of their way to indicate that they felt he
was a brave man, that lie displayed a degree of courage in going
over to the particular automobile, even though he felt that
there was an individual in there with a pistol, which obviously
could have been used against him.

And I don’t think there

has ever been any claim made by the respondent himself that
Officer Connolly acted imprudently, that ha acted —
Q

Well, didn’t Terry proceed on the assumption

that — and cire.tnsfcances, such as in Terry — officers wouldn’t
be deterred at all, because they felt that the situation
demanded soma aouion, and it was no use trying to deter them?

17
MR. BROWN'S:

Well, I can't read necessarily Your

Honor’s conclusion into that particular decision; but I think
that Terry clearly points out in a number of locations that,
one, that there is no prohibition against the officer, for
example, from stopping a person on the street and asking him
questions.

I think, that that is the -— I don’t think that

X think that the —Q

Well, suppose, Mr,Browne, that —

MR, BROWNE:
Q

Yes?

~ ■ instead of sitting in the car,.. Williams had

been standing at the curb, and Sergeant Connolly acted on
precisely the same information on which he did act here?
MR. BROWNE:
Q

Yes.

Would that be' covered by Terry?

MR. BROWNE: Well, the distinction —
0

Would that be covered by Terry?

MR. BROWNE:

It would be covered by a number of the

general phrases contained within the Terry decision as to whether
or not the officer is.acting as a reasonably prudent person
under all of the circumstances.
Obviously we get to the distinction, which is the
distinction my brother urges upon the Court, and that is between
some, type. of- a furtive movement, which is observed by the
officer himself, or whether he can justify a protective search,
exclusively on the basis of the information which he receives.

18
And that, I think, is my brother’s argument in his claim and
at least as I read his brief, is that in order for any police
officer to justify a protective search, a self-protective
search, he must be able to point to some matter which he has
personally observed himself, which he indicates makes him feel
that his position is in peril, and that justifies him to go
ahead and make this particular search.
I think he urges that no matter how strong the
authenticity of the information which is received, that a police
officer just cannot —
Q

Well, do you think that this case should be

decided as it would be decided if the hypothetical X put to you
was the ease? that he is just standing there, and the officer,
acting on —
MR. BROWNEj
Q

Yes, X cannot — I cannot submit —

The idea he's in the automobile doesn’t make

that different?
MR. BROWNEs

No, I cannot submit to Your Honor any

grave justification &r a distinction between the fact that he
was standing on the street corner or the fact that he was
seated in the automobile, other than the fact that being in
the automobile it might have been considerably more difficult
for Connolly to observe a furtive movement, such as a movement
to go for his gun.
Q

But Judge Friendly, I suppose, would have

19
conceded, howeve r, that if the informer had just simply said,
"I saw the gun in his waistband”, that the officer could have
done what he did?
MR. BROWNE:

I would assume on the basis of Judge

Friendly's —
Q

From a reliable informant, and there's a basis

given for the informant’s telling him?
MR. BROWNE:

I can only submit that if the informant

had said, t!I saw the gun there", well, quitely possibly
Officer Connolly may have had a basis to go over and make an
arrest, and we wouldn't need to be --Q

Well, why wouldn't he?

MR. BROWNE:

I mean, —

T\ think *— I submit that he would have.

I submit that he would have.

If the informant had only added

that one more piece of information that "I saw the gun", then
I think that we wouldn't be here on the question of stop-andfrisk or protective search.

I think Officer Connolly would

have had
Q

Probable cause.

MR. BROWNE:

— probable cause to go over and make an

arrest of Williams, without regard to —
Q

Well, suppose Officer Connolly had been at the

police station, blocks away, and the informant told him just
what he told him at the gas station, and Connolly got in the
squad car and went down and then everything happened that

happened here?
MR. BRMWNE:

Well, X submit that — are you including

the fact that he indicated that he saw the cun, or are you
excluding that?
Q

Nof I'm taking precisely these facts —

MR. BROWNE:
Q

—

Precisely these

-

except that he got the information at the

police station several blocks away from the informant rather
than at the gas station across the street.
MR. BROWNE: Well, then, of course, it relates again
to the propriety of an investigation.
have had probable

Obviously he wouldn’t

cause for an arrest under that situation —

you wouldn't ever, know that ha knew Mr. Williams' name, as a
matter of fact.
Q
stronger?

But it would be stronger; wouldn't it be
Because he actually went there and found what the

information said he’d find?

I mean, at least that there was a

man there?
MR. BROWNE: That's fight.

That's correct.

If that's

— there would have been substantially more corroboration of
the information -’hat he received:

the existence of a man in

his automobile on Hamilton Street at that particular time.
That would have been corroborative of the information
supplied by the reporting witness to him.

I concur in that.

As I understand again, finally, my brother's position

it would be that no matter how authentic the information
received, li­ the informant had been a judge or if the informant
had been three o; four judges, still, unless Officer Connolly
personally observed something in the nature of a furtive
movement, a furt'.ve action, he still couldn’t proceed.

It.

would be illogical or unreasonable for him to fear that his
life was in peril, and, consequently, it would have been
illogical for him to make the protective search at that
particular time,
Q

But the —

MR. BROWNE:
Q

Yes?

—> search of the car wasn't a protective

search?
MR, BROWNE:

Ho.

The search of the automobile

itself hinges upon, obviously, whether or not the disclosure
of the pistol supplied sufficient probable cause for him to
place him under arrest.
Q

1 thought you said he did place him under

arrest.
MR. BRCWNB: After he found the pistol, he proceeded
to place him under arrest for possession of that pistol.

Then

he made his contemporaneous search of the person, which
disclosed the heroin? and of the automobile, which disclosed the
machete
It is relevant as to those second two searches that

22
they# of course, followed the arrest# and they took place right
there on Hamilton Street.
Q

Well, where was the machete, Mr. Browne?

MR. BROWNE: The machete was under the passenger's
seat of the front,, in the car — the passenger's side of the
automobile.

And that's where we

MR. BROWNE:

he could make an attempt — it might be a foolish attempt, but

Q

Well, what was the basis for the search of the

car?
MR. BROWNE: That was a contemporaneous search,
contemporaneous to his arrest there on Hamilton Street.

I

don't make any claim that the machete was disclosed by a
Protective search,not at all.

After Mr. Williams was arrested,

a search was made contemporaneous, incident to his arrest, of

24

his person and .rv the automobile which disclosed these items.
Q

Vl ill, there? s nothinq in the record about this

informant except that he knew him,
MR. BROWNEs There is some — there is a considerable
description of t siimony, in which he describes information
that the informant had given him 'before, which did not lead
to an arrest, but related to particular criminal activities
taking place at

particular location, which the officer

proceeded to investigate.
Thera .s also a substantial cross-examination, in
which the officer is inquired of, relating to the informant’s
past record, and he indicates a number of other items which
he personally know about the informant; of the informant
himself.
I do want to make — save a couple of minutes if I
might for a rebuttal.

But X would submit, in a nutshell, if

I could, that the position of the petitioner in this particular
matter is that when you put the officer on the street next
to the automobile, that yon want to balance off the intrusion
involved against the possibility of the violent crime which
could have occurred right then and there, which obviously
could have included up to his being mortally wounded.

It is

the position of :.he petitioner here that balancing those two
together, it's net illogical or unconstitutional to maintain
that the officer was justified in taking whatever efforts he

25
did to protect himself.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Hennessey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD F. HFNNFSSEY, ES(1. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HENNESSEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The only additional facts which I would add, in
order to give soma clarification to the situation as it
existed in 1966, when Officer Connolly mat this informant, was
that after Officer Connolly received the information, at that
juncture Officer Connolly had a certain set of facts in his
mind.

He had been told something by a person whom he says he

know, and ho had been — he says he believed this person to ba
reliable because once before the person told him something that
he couldn’t, substantiate, but he nonetheless believed that
what they told him was true, notwithstanding that there was
no basis for believing it to be so.
When Officer Connolly was told:

"There’s a man in

that car with a gun at his waist, and drugs", he was looking
across the strait at a car with a man seated in the passenger
side.

He saw the man.

He saw the car.

At that point he

then called the station and elicited help, asked them to sand
another cruiser.

Having dispatched another cruiser, Officer

26
Connolly then started across the street, proceeding, in uniform,
towards that vehicle, walking to the front of the vehicle,
where ha was ohv.ously in plain view of the passenger inside,
up to the side of the car and knocked on the side window, and
said, ‘’Open the door."
At that point the window was rolled down, which
would infer possibly that the person wanted to find out why
the officer was ’nocking on the window.

And that’s about as

much as on© might reasonably draw from that*
When he looked inside he saw a man he didn’t know,
he saw nothing out of the ordinary; the man didn’t do anything?
the man didn’t say anything.

He couldn’t see any gun,

He

couldn’t sse anything in the car that would indicate contraband
or criminal activity.
He then reached

arid the record tends to show he

reached partially under the man’s coat, apparently the coat
was in a loosener position, down and his hand reached the waist­
band and did touch a gun? he then withdrew the gun.
At that, point Officer Connolly, I- would submit, under
Connecticut law, still had no probable cause to believe that
any crime had been committed, because in Connecticut it’s not
a crime to carry a gun at your waist.

Unfortunately, or —

well, X won’t bother to comment on my feelings about those
laws.
But Connecticut appears to be a pro-gun State.

Our

2?
constitution prefects the right of individuals to carry guns
in their own defense.

We have statutes which permit people to

carry guns around at their waist or in their car, or hidden
on their person, concealed wherever they please? the only
requirement being either that they come in within one of
approximately ten exceptions in the statute, which permit people
to carry guns without permits, or that they have a permit.
So when Officer Connolly knew a man had a gun, that's
all he knew.

He didn't know that the man was committing a

crime.
When he withdrew the gun from Mr. Williams9 waistband,
hs still didn't have probable cause, 1 would submit, to arrest
him.
Q

May I ask, Mr. Hennessey —

MR. HEHMESSEy,t:
Q

Yes, Your Honor?

“'-of' what crime in connection with the gun was

he convicted?
MR. BEiMESSEYs'

He was convicted of a crime under

29-35, which is carrying a gun without a permit.

And then he

was — the machete —
Q

In other words, he didn't fall within one of

the exceptions where he didn't need a permit?
MR. HENNESSEY:

As it was ultimately proven at trial,

he was not, for example, carrying the gun as part of trans­
porting his household goods or carrying his gun for merchandise

ing purposes, or carrying a gun from a dealer to his home.
Q

Weil, was it likely that he would have fallen

under those circumstances, being found as he was in this area
at 2;CO o'clock in the morning?
MR. BEbHESSBV: Well, X would submit it would be
likely that a man could be out at 2:00 o'clock in the morning
with a gun at hi

waist and have a permit for it.

X would

think, frankly, that very often people do carry their guns
at 2s00 in the morning.
Q

Well, isn't the burden of proof on the person to

show that he has a permit after the gun is found?
MR. HENNESSEY:
no.

Not under the statute in Connecticut,

No, the statute in Connecticut, as it's construed by our

courts and in canes where it’s tried, requires the State to
prove the 'negative, that he did not have a permit, in order to
sustain its burden.
Q

':•?]iat does an officer dc in that situation, if

he discovers a man with a gun and doesn't believe he's within
the ten exceptions?

Is he supposed to go back and find out

whether he has a permit, or does he ask the man whether he’s

got a permit?
MR. HENNESSEY:

X would say they usually ask the man.

Frankly, at that point, if they didn't believe him, they would
probably determino from the man where he got the permit and
would contact thorn, since, under the State statutes, permits

29

are issued by a number of authorities, including any municipal
officer or any chief of police of any particular town.

So that

the permit that a man carries is generally issued from one
jurisdiction, such as, say, the town of Windsor.

They could

get on the radio and determine whether or not a permit was
issued to a particular individual.
Q

Well, there’s no indication that Mr. Williams

made any representation that he did have a permit, is there?
MR. HENNESSEY:

No.

Mr. Williams, according to the

record was never ■— one, he was never asked.
taken and the policeman said:

The gun was

6<3et out of the car, you're

under arrest.”
Ke was then body searched and that’s the time when
the heroin was seised.

And also at that point, of course, the

two other officers had arrived on the scene.

Williams Is

then out of the car, immobilized and in the custody of the
other two officers, -Q

Wall, 1' don’t get this —•

MR. HENNESSEYs Excuse me, Mr. Justice.
Q

Ha was arrested, the basis of the arrest was the

gun, wasn’t it?
MR. HENNESSEYs That's right,
He was arrested because the officer withdrew the gun
from his waist.
Q

1 ad you suggest that the mar© fact that he has

30

the gun does not justify, under Connecticut Xaw, an arrest?
is that it?
MR* HBmsESSEY:

That's right.

Because there’s no

crime for carrying a gun. There’s only crime for carrying an
unregistered, or gun without a permit.

So at the point, for

example, I could he carrying a gun in Connecticut, and —
Q

And you say

MR, HEKNESSEY2

or have probable cause to believe, in order to make an arrest

Q

Well, before you get to that, when you find a

man with a gun or the street in Hartford, Connecticut, and
you take the gun out of his belt, what do you do? What does
the policeman do at that stage?
MR. HBi WESSEY;

In Hartford, they arrest him.

They

take him down to the station, and if, after they check him
out, they find out he's all right, they let him go.
Q

What’s wrong with that?

MR. HENNESSEY: Well, because — because —

Wall, what would you suggest they do?

What can the police do?

MR. HENNESSEY;

I would say that the policeman ~~

that would then ;:ome into the issue of whether or not the
policeman has the right to make an investigative detention,
which is often discussed, as to whether or not,,

that point,

they have a right to hold the man for purposes'of cheeking.
Q

Well, Mr. Hennessey,

Q

What do you think the policeman should do in

that case?
MR. HE'OTSSEY:

All right. What

they do do is they

hold him and check
Q

What do you think they should do?

MR. HENNESSEY:

1 think so

1 think they should hold him and

32
Q

Well, what did they do in this ease?

MR. HENNESSEY: This was not — this — at this
point they had a.'.-ready seised the gua.

This was not -- your

example is a plain-sight search.
0

Well, if a man has a leaded revolver, and if~-

ths policeman is going to hold him, but he can't taka the gun
away from him?
MR. HENNESSEY:

Yes, he can take the gun away from

him, 1 would submit.
Q

Well, I thought you meant that.

MR. HE'jMESSEY:
Q

Yes, sir.

But the point —

And they could detain him? you admit that?

MR. HENNESSEY*

No, I don’t — I don’t get to the

point of arguing whether or not that is constitutionally
permissible, no.

I'm saying —* you ask me what do they do,

and I said that’s what they do.
Q

No, I asked what you suggest they do,

MR, HENNESSEY: Right.
Q

Now, let’s try it again.

MR. HENNESSEYx All right.
Q

Under the constitution, what would you suggest

is the most that the policeman could do, looking at a loaded
,45 in the man’s bait?
MR. HENNESSEY?

He may nave the right to stop him to inquire as to

And the man wouldn't say anything?

MR. HENNESSEY:

Yes. And'die man doesn't say anything.

The suggestion I would make is that in the
Connecticut law
Q

a would not have an right to hold him.

Because your point, as 1 understand it, Mr.

Hennessey, is that under Connecticut law the possession of a
gun is no more a badge of criminality than the fact the man
might have a hat on?
MR. HENNESSEY:
Q

Or golf clubs, or anything of that. type.

MR. HE NNESSEY:
Q

That is true.

Right.

It's perfectly — it's as innocent as a golf

club.
MR. HENNESSEYs Right.

Well, it isn't to me.

But it is under our law.
Q

Wellt 2'm trying —

MR. HENNESSEY:

let me ask you this hypothetical question.

Ml right.

Suppose, in exactly the circumstances of the

information that came to the officer in this case, except that
the automobile is removed one block away, so that it's out of
sight, and the tip is exactly the same. And the policeman

34
goes around the corner and down and finds the car, but .instead
of finding the driver in the driver's seat he finds him crouched
behind the car, timing the pistol over the hood or some part
of the car —
MR. EEimS SEY:
Q

Right.

MR. HENNESSEY:

Oh, yes.

Me, no.

additional element of criminal activity.

This is at the

point where the man is —
Q

Well, that may be a question —

Do you just carry it in your belt to frighten

people, or to use it?
MR, HENNESSEY;

Well, that -- I seem to be going at

cross purposes, but the point is not whether or not it’s good
or bad? the point is whether or not the policeman was justified
in intarferring with that citizen"s liberty, or takes some
action vis-a-vis that citizen at a point where the citizen has
told him he5s holding the gun with an intent to use it.
Notwithstanding that he tells him he intends to use it for
defensive reasons.

justified in acting, notwithstanding whether or not the person
might have the right to usa it for that reason.

are distinct.

is that he does have a gun?
MR. HENNESSEY! Right. Well, if there is — X think,
as 1 road Terry, trying to square it with the Fourth Amendment
limitations on any invasion, 1 read Terry as saying that
where situations arose which justified a 'police officer, in
making an initial stop, or interfering with a citlsen’s
liberty for the purpose of inquiry, that there may also be a
contemporaneous right to make a body search or & body frisk,
a pat-down, for defensive purposes.

But I don’t think that

it follows that every time a police officer has a right to make

39
a stop, that he has a concomitant right to make a frisk,
Q

Wall, Isra *)fist saying here the suspicion that

ha had included that of a gun, and he would have had some
reasonable suspicion to think he might be in a dangerous
situation.
MR. HENNESSEY: Well, that — that takes you —

Q

even further,

If you assume the reasonableness of the suspicion.

MR. HEHNESSEY; Right.
The question the;:e again is;

Well, no, no, I don't, know.

did Terry say that any time a

police officer has reasonable cause to believe that a person
may be stopped, he may also contemporaneously frisk him; or did
Terry say he has reasonable causa to believe that the parson
has a right — ha has a right to stop the person, and he further
has reasonable cause to believe that the person may be armed
and presently dangerous to his — to the officer or to the
public.

The question then is:

Is a citizen; in Connecticut,

even assuming ycJ have a suspicion that he, or a reasonable
cause to believe that he*8 armed, does that, ipso facto, make

The point that X have been trying to make is:

let1®

assume there was no gun at all, let's assume this same person
said to Officer Connolly, "There's a man in that car with
drugs", and let’s: accept the fact that the term "drugs" was
sufficient to place in Officer Connolly's mind "illicit drugs",
and in fact, 2 believe, at one time the word "narcotics" was
used and in most other testimony the reference was to "drugs".
My claim would be that at that juncture Officer
Connolly had no right to make this confrontation? and having
no right to make the initial confrontation, whether Williams
was standing on the street or seated in a car or seated in a
house, then, therefore, nothing followed as a matter of right
from that, including the right, then, to make a body search,
.

limited or otherwise.
Q

Well, suppose the informant in the filling

station had said.to the officer, "There's a car over there and
2 think there's a holdup of that bank going on, but watch
out, because he's got a gun in his belt” —
MR. HENNESSEY:
Q

Yes.

.and whan the officer approached the car, tha

engine was running.
MR. HENNESSEY:

Q

Yes, sir.

What's your position about the scope c? the

officer's duties and powers then?
MR.'HEK'dESSJSY* Well, I think that — I think the scope

42

•— it's really net my opinion as to the scope of the
officer's duties or powers,

I think that the problem becomes

whether or not, under the Constitution, the. officer has a right
to intrude upon the liberty of any individual, and if the
officer is advised as to a certain course of conduct, the
officer may then elect to go and investigate that course of
conduct.
The question would still come down to whether or net,

in the course of that election to investigate further, he
had a right to search a person, a right to search any citizen.
And I would say, under the facts as you've given them to me,
it would have no doubt caused him to investigate further, but
1 don't believe that it would have justified any intrusion.
Q

Investigate further by doing what?

m. HENNESSEY: Well, first cf all, he would —
Q

T ip on -- could he tap on the window?

MR. HENNESSEY: Well, I would assume, if the — the
officer would probably be more interested in what was going on
inside the bank, not v7hat was going on inside the car.

If

the — under the facts you —
Q

Wall, should he wait to see if a bank robbery

is really completed and then try to have a shootout as they
come out of the bank to tha getaway car?
MR. HENNESSEY: Wall, that ~~ I suppose different —*
one policeman might assume that the greatest source of

43
concern to the public at this juncture is what's going on
inside the .bank, and might elect to go inside the bank.
Another office?; night say, Maybe I should stake them out and
see what I can do when they come out; because this might be
the safer course from a public point of view,;
So it comes back

always it evolves down to the

officer's judgment, and I don't believe every officer would
act the same way.
Q

Well, that's-a cutback, that every officer would

not act the same way; but has not this Court and other courts
as well said on many occasions that the conduct of the police
officer must be judged ultimately as it was seen through the
eyes of an experienced, prudent police officer at the time and
placa and in all the circumstances?
MR. HE.iNESSEYs

No, 1 don't believe this Court has

ever said that totally, I think this Court has said;

Xn judging

the conduct of a police officer, consistent with Fourth
Amendment limitations on that officer's rights, due regard can
foe given to the officer's experience and to a subjective
standard, based oh the subjectivity of experienced police
officers, or a subjective-objective standard? but that at some
point this Court — I understand it to say, you have to stop
just deciding whether or not every policeman would do the
same thing ana start deciding whether or not any policeman
can do that

Ye.is don't think that the motor of the car running

adds any dimension that would alter this case?
MR. HEYHESSEY:
it would add a fa.at»
.can't say whethe:
it does.

1 think it ados — yes, 1 think

I think it would add another fact, I

it adds up to probable cause? I don't think

But I think — 1 think in every case, and I think

Terry pointed that out, it has to be judged, and it's
extraordinarily difficult to sat limits within the context of
this set of facts.
My initial reaction to this case, in the light of
Terry, is that:

Was Officer Connolly justified in going across

and making a search?

Because when Officer Connolly went

across the street, he didn't have Terry vs. Ohio in mind,
because Terry vs. Ohio was two years away at that time.
Officer Connolly knew that there was a man — he was
told there was a man with a gun at his waist, and drugs; and
when he walked oror to that car, he went over with one thing
in mind, and he did that one thing.
of that one man to seise the gun.

He executed a body search
And havinq seised what he

was told he would find, he decided, at that point, he was
going to arrest him.
And that, to me, is what happened here.

To me, this

is not what I conceptualise to bs a Terry situation which I
read as being an attempt to relate the street experience
problem of the police officer to the limitations of probable

45
cause.

Otherwiso,

find it difficult to square Terry with the

Fourth Amendment«
But if one says that the police officer has legitimate
reason at certain points to make a confrontation, and having
made that confrontation where the facts present themselves, he
then has a right to conduct a limited pat-down for his own
safety, or for the safety of citizens? then it's more reasonable
to relate the Terry situation to the Fourth Amendment.
0

Certainly there’s language in Terry, though, that

goes beyond your rather narrow reading of it, isn’t there?
MR. HEHNESSEY:

Yes, depending on — I’d say depending

on whose opinion one draws upon.

Some of the opinions I read

as being much broader than that? yea.
But I — yes, sir?
Q

But Terry wasn’t — the officer in Terry was a

man of some forty-odd years of police experience in that type
of work in that area.
MR. HENNESSEY?
Q

That’s right,

But 1 don’t think Terry is limited to that at all.

Do you?
MR. HEiTNSSSBY:

Tell, looking at the facts in Terry

and those that s-;.-e»a to be most persuasive were that when the
Officer McFadden in the Terry case went towards the three
...

. v

suspects, he at that point believed that he was looking at a
daylight stickup.

That’s what part of it was.

Q

But that wasn't his business.

His business was

protecting the s-^ora, the department store.
MR. BE; ;NBS8B¥ s -That was Officer McFadden1 s business?
Well, it did not appear to me that at that point that was what
he considered to be his business.
0

That's what I’m saying, I wouldn’t try to give

the particulars out, but I think the Terry case says that if
an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a crime is
about to be committed, and on the basis of that goes up to
question, and when he gets there he feels his life la in
danger, he has a right to pat the man.
Now, in Terry, there were three or four guys standing
there, and each one of them was twice as large as the
detective,
ME, HENNESSEY:
Q

That’s right.,

fSotto voeej

So I think that’s Terry.

Now, it seems to me

in your case if the informant's information was equivalent to
what the police detective in Terry had, he had a right to
go there and pat him down.

So your point, it seems to me, is

whether the informant’s information was equivalent to what the
detective saw in Tarry.
MR. HENNESSEY:

Isn't that right?
That is — yes. That is, in the

context of Terry, that seems to be one of the suggestions of
Terry,

ted the implication, as I read Terry, was that it was

—- that’s why I said that it seemed in Terry that this Court

47
was speaking in :erms of the street confrontation situation,
and that
Q

Kali, wouldn’t you say that if this was a

reliable informs: it, who had given this wan or some other
policeman six different pieces of good information, which had
led to six criminal convictions, that that would give him the
same rights that the detective in Terry had’?
Would you go that far?
MR. HENNESSEY:
at that point,

I'd go farther»

X would go farther

X think if you*re talking about a policement

being informed by what would satisfy the standards of
reliability of contemporaneous criminal conduct being
committed, then he has the right, notwithstanding Terry, to
go forward and to snake an arrest.
Q

You mean as probable cause?

MR. HENNESSEY:

Yes, if he has.probable cause.

And

this then gives him the right to go forward and actually
confront him, and then it would have been irrelevant.

And

that's why, to a certain extent, even the application of Terry
by the Connecticut Supreme Court was irrelevant, because the
Connecticut Sups me Court decided that there was a reliable
informant here, and this then framed one,.of the issues, which
was that issue of reliability.

Since I would submit this

person, as a matter of law, was not reliable? and I would
also submit that under those circumstances that Tarry did not.

intend to fashion a new doctrine which would permit 'police
officers, in substance, to make searches 021 less than probable
cause, •
0

Do you think we can redetermine the credibility

issue in the ease here?

Or are we bound by the fact determina­

tion made in Connecticut and endorsed by the highest court of
Connecticut?
MR. HEHNESSSY: Well, I think this Court can make
that inquiry to determine whether or not the case presents
one that requires a certain decision.

I don’t think that you

can make the basic credibility determination, no.

I think if —

1 think the credibility problem might cause the Court to feel

that this was not the appropriate case for a particular
decision that it sought to render.

But the credibility issue

is not substantially in dispute, other than that we were faced
with a situation wherein it appeared that the officer relied
on something quite different from what he subsequently
testified he relied on.

Because wa did have somewhat of a

conflict between the lower court testimony of Officer
Connolly and the Superior Court testimony»
But taking'-the testimony of Officer Connolly as 100
percent true, you're still left with, 1 submit, the fact
situation that d(;ss riot lead itself to any right of a police
officer to go forward and conduct a search, based on an
undisclosed informant, who did not meet the test of reliability,

49
either test of reliability.
0

W.iat was deficient about the — about his —■

about the informant, insofar as telling the truth was concerned?
MR, HENNESSEY:

Ho> 1 said it's not in tolling the

truth, 2 said insofar as the test of reliability.

The

informant in this case, according to Officer Connolly, had once,
six months before, told Officer Connolly there was homosexual
activity going on in the Bridgeport railroad station,
Q

Wall, now -**»

MR. HENNESSEY;
Q

And — excuse me.

2 thought that Judge Friendly indicated that

if the informer .had said, in addition to who he was and what
his experience with the police had been, if he had said in
addition, ”2 saw the gun", that there would have been probable
cause.
MR. HENNESSEY:

Wo.

X don't agree with that at ell,

as being what Judge Friendly said.

Judge Friendly went at some

length to discuss the basic reliability of the informant,

He

even, for example, went so far as to say, in his dissent,
that "bet’s assume that this tip that the officer had
received, the hcacsexual conduct, had been verified and had
led to an arrest1'.'

Judge Friendly also said that in his mind

he did. not believe that this, would make this person a reliable
informant on crimes of narcotics.
So, no. Judge Friendly did not —

50
Q

Well„ let’s — assuming for the moment that the

informer was reliable in the sense of the first leg of informer
reliability —
MR. HENNESSEY:
Q

L:at us assume that.

MR. HENNESSEY:
Q

Right.

Yes.

That the officer was justified in believing the

informer was telling the truth.
MR, HENNESSEYs
Q

All right.

Your position still is that that doesn't give

him reasonable cuuse or reasonable suspicion under Terry to
make a stop?
MR. HENNESSEY:
0

Yes, that's right.

Well, don’t you go beyond that, that even if

it did, even if it did, that that would not justify the fact
that he could make a stop, would not justify the seisures of
the machete and the narcotics and the rest?
MR. HENNESSEY:

Ultimately, yes.

Yes.

But that

again is — I'm sorry, my time has expired.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may answer.

Complete your answer.
■ MR. HENNESSEY:

Oh.

Excuse me.

My ultimate position is that the case should be
viewed not just us an application of Terry vs« Ohio to
Connecticut or Sibron vs. New York .to Connecticut, but it also

51
ought to be viewed in tha context of the Connecticut law; and
that the Connecticut law, as I view it, is different totally
from the Ohio law and the statute involved in Terry vs» Ohio
was printed, 1 believe, at page 1, and it's like the Sullivan
law that applied in New York; but unfortunately Connecticut
does not so legislateQ

Wall, Connecticut,, apparently, has decided,

though, that under its law, when an officer finds a gun in
somebody's waistband, they can be arrested and convicted for
it?
MR, H£:iNESSEY: Well, yes, but they ~~ but again that
issue -i~
Q .

Well, that’s the result of the State court

proceedings, isn't it?
MR. HENNESSEY:

Yes, but the Terry application was

merely dictum to that, because the court found, in nineteen
sixty- — in nineteen- — that there v?as a reliable informant,
and. it therefore went on to find the rights of an —
Q

Well, I know, but --

MR. HENNESSEY:

*— arrest based on a reliable

informant.
Q

that doesn't get you very, far, becaus© your

point is, oven if the informant was reliable, when he finds
the gun, you can’t arrest? because it doesn’t give you probable
cause to arrest

52
Connecticut's decision is quite the contrary in this
case, under Connecticut law.
MR. HE!,'NESSEY:

Wall, no, because — you see,

because then tha tip, if it came from a reliable informant,
was a tip of two crimes;

one being tha gun and the other being

drugs,
If ~~ they said that the officer had reliable
— a reliable informant who told him, "There’s a man sifting
over there" —•
Q

I know, but

MR. HENNESSEY:
Q

— “with drugs.”

—- they let him be convicted of carrying the

gun,
MR. HENNESSEY;
Q

Of course,

And they let him seise the gun,

MR. HENNESSEY: That would be true.,

Thut would make

no difference whether or not the gun was ever mentioned,
because’the
drugs themselves would have given him the right to
*
arrest,

and tha finding of the gun would have been permissible

as an incidental body search, after he had the initial right
to arrest,
Q

But you don’t have a right to take from — to

take everything you find in an incidental body search, unless
it's contraband or used in committing a crimo, do you?
MR. HENNESSEY: That’s right.

53

Q

tod X take it your argument is that the gun was

doesn’t meet those tests.
MR. HEIIHESSEY:

Oh, I think he had the right to

remove it temporarily, and ’then the question would be whether
or not he had the right to return it.

tod then — and,

additionally, whether or not he had the right to having —wall, excuse me.

He has the right to remove it, as a part of

the self-protective body search.

I think that would be so.

tod that would fee because he has probable cause .to believe
that this man’s committing a felony.

So he has the right to

remove the giro.
He may not be able, ultimately, to charge him, because
the carrying of the gun may be lawful.
Q

fell, now, when we come to trying to evaluate

what is the law of Connecticut under the statute that you’ve
been arguing, namely, that he can lawfully sit there at 2;30
in the morning with a loaded gun in his belt, is not the
decision of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, the State law,
binding on this Court?
MR. ESHNESSEY: Well, my only answer X can give you
to that. Your Honor, is that the State Court decision in
Williams, which was decided in —* actually the whole case was
framed before Terry was even thought of, and when the
Connecticut Supreme Court decided, if you examine the facts
of the Connecticut Supremo Court, they said that this’ was- an

54
officer acting or what, they use the ter», "reliable informant",
which has been defined in Connecticut to mean an informant who
conforms to the Aguilar-Spinelli test, who had probable cause
to believe that a man was committing a drug crime»

And that

being so, he had a right to arrest Williams, and therefore they
said, also by way of, what I would submit, dictum that Terry
vs. Ohio was a part ofthe common law of Connecticut.
And — I'm sorry, I'm way beyond my time; I can't
argue that.

But I don't think it ever was, and I don't

believe that statutorily it can be.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, Mr. Hennessey.
Mr. Browne, clo you have anything further?
MR. BROWNE:

I would, if I have time left, but I

don't know whether I do or not — apparently, I do.

I would

like to address myself very briefly to the question —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Let me say we'll

enlarge your time three minutes, to conform with the additional
time.

So you've got time enough.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD A. BROWNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BROWNE:

Thank you, sir.

The question of the possibility of the pistol permit
appears for the first time in 1970, when the matter is argued
in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

In other words, in

the Superior Court in Connecticut, in the Connecticut Supreme

55

Court and in the United .States District Court, counsel for
Mr» Williams never advanced the argument which is being made
here to you gentlemen this afternoon, or which was coneededly
made in the Seeonrd Circuit Court.

That being the possibility

that he might have had a permit, and, consequently, if he had
had a permit, than his possession of-that pistol might not
have been a crime.
So, consequently, the petitioner -** the warden or
the State or what-have-you — never presented to any of the
lower courts any evidence regarding the frequency with which
pistol permits are issued by the Superintendent of Police in
Bridgeport.
In other words, for Mr. Williams1 possession of the
pistol to have bean legal and not a violation of this
particular statute, he would have had to have obtained a
permit from the Superintendent of Police in Bridgeport.
Now, that particular issue itself was never framed in
any of the arguments at all before the State Court; that was
never presented.

It was never framed within the pleadings of

the petition itself for a habeas corpus? it was never argued
in any fashion whatsoever before the District Court.

So it

took Williams four years, from 966 to '70, to determine that
possibly ha might have had a permit and that possibly he
might not have Sn.«en guilty of this particular statute which
relates to carrying a gun.

56
And I oubmit that accordingly the State or the
petitioner here ;ad never

has never presented any particula

evidence on that point.
I think that it follows, also, as to whether or not
Officer Connolly was justified in arresting him for carrying
a pistol without a permit, that,-, one, once he found out that
the pistol was there», once he removed that pistol, X think
that that attach.js a tremendous amount of reliability or
credibility to the balance of the information received,
in addition to the pistol he also had narcotics.
Xn other words, I think that it's a freer conclusion
that Officer Connolly could legitimately reach, that if the
man has a pistol and if he has narcotics, that he dossn’t have
a permit to carry that pistol, because, I#m sure the evidence
would have shown

that pistol permits are not granted without

any consideration to anybody that applies for one.

Pistol

permits are granted only upon a substantial cause that a
person is entitled to have one,
Finally, the last argument that I would make about
the pistol permit is, of course, that all that was necessary
for Officer Connolly to arrest

Robert Williams was probable

cause that Mr. Williams had committed a particular crime of
carrying a pistol without a permit.

It wasn't necessary that

he prove ft without a doubt.
And X think that, again, Connolly would have justifi

3?
ably relied upon his twenty years’ experience as a police
officer, in saying that v?hen he placed this man under - arrest
for carrying a pistol without a permit, that if the man had in
fact had a permit he would have told him so.

And'X think he

would have told him so emphatically that “You can’t arrest me
for this particular charge? t do have a permit issued by your
Superintendent or Police.*8
*

And, of course, finally, that there is no claim at
all, that I can see, that in fact he was illegally arrested
because he had a permit.

I think' it’s conceded that he did

not have one.
Again, I submit, and it would be our position, that
there is absolutely no indication here whatsoever that
Officer Connolly knew Robert Williams before this—incident,
that he was acting out of any desire to harass Williams, that
he was acting out of any motive, any improper motive of any
sort whatsoever, I submit.
Q

Mr* Browne, —

MB. BROWNE:
Q

Yes.

— do I get your Stated position accurately,

that you do concede that you can’t support the search, that
is the machete and the heroin seised from the person, without
a finding that the arrest was on probable cause?
MR. B-F -WNB:
Q

Yes.

The arrest for carrying the pistol?

58

MR. BROWNEs

Abstolutely no.

No.

Without question,

the subsequent searches have to stand or fail on the basis of
the «*- Q

In other words, you don’t try to support them

on any theory that this was a Terry kind of search, and to the
extent that — I mean Tarry kind of detention, and, to the
extent it was, that that would support the search?
MR. BROWNE* We maintain Terry supports his seising
that pistol.
Q

Yes, but not

MB. BROWNE*

not —

Stop two is then we submit he is

legally arrested for possession o£ a pistol without a permit,
and step three, we submit that he is validly contemporaneously
searched, incidental to his arrest, which disclosed the heroin
a nd V7hi.ch disclosed the machete under the seat.
And, incidentally, for the purpose of the record,
as long as the machete is more than four inches in length, it
is a crime in the; State of Connecticut to carry it.

It is not

a crime to carry a knife with a blade less than four inches,
and it was represented that the machete was —
Q

And you don’t claim the informer’s tip was

probable cause to search for heroin?
MR. BROWNE *

Ho.

No, I don’t.

I don’t submit that

the informer’s tip was probable cause to search for heroin,
but 2 do make the- claim, relative to the possession of the

59

pistol, that the location of the pistol should —
0

This was Terrys

MR, BROWNE:
yes.

reasonable suspicion?

The search and the seizure of the pistol,

But 1 would like, too, to represent that the information

that he also had narcotics, and the existence of the pistol
is substantial to corroborate that: he did not have a permit
for his pistol, on the claim that a person with narcotics would
not have a permit for his pistol.
Q

Well, you aren't making the argument that the

finding of the gun was corroboration enough of the informer’e;
tip, are you?
MR. BROVRIE:

To proceed to arrest for narcotics?

I have not, as yet, obviously, by two briefs advanced' that
argument, but 1 —
Q

You haven't made the Draper argument?

MR. BROWNEs

I have not as yet, no, but I would

submit —

Q

. You're about to?

You're about to, is that it?

MR. BROWNE: Well, of course, obviously, if the —
it depends again as to whether or not the pistol is validly
seised.

If the pistol is not validly seised, I think as

corroboration it would go out as the fruit of an illegal
search in any event»

. .

But again I —- yes, I'm sorry,
Q

Well, the informer did tell the officer that the

60
man sitting in the car across the street had narcotic© in his
possession.
MR. BElWHEs
Q

'i.

SS .

And the officer testified that he had reason

to believe this was a reliable informant.
HR, BROWHR* That’s correct.
0

Why wasn't there —* why don’t yon at least

argue that there was probable cause to search for narcotics?
MR. BROWKE: Well, essentially on the basis that
there has been no showing sufficiently that this informer,
himself, had previously presented sufficient information to
make him a reliable informant; or, two, that he doesn't state
the basis of his knowledge, ha doesn't say that he saw the
narcotics or that, williams told him he had the narcotics.
The whole question, of course, of street arrest is
a field of its own.

I’m not making any claim that anything

other than the LUw set forth in White ley would be governing
the situation here.
Q

Well, Judge Friendly said there's a difference

between an expert on homosexuality and an expert on drugs.
Bo you agree?
MR. BRC. 'NE;

'£ can’t dispute with Judge Friendly

on that.
Q

This is an age of specialization!
{laughter. 3

61
HR. BROWNS;

I go along with the Justice * s remarks.

The only other thing X would say is that X was a
little surprised this afternoon when my brother did make the
claim that he felt that it was improper. illegal, unconstitutional
„„ whatever you have -- for Connolly to walk cut of the gas
station, across Hamilton Street, in view of his statement in
j;

*

'

his brief that the case law recognising the right to stop
applies fairly broad standards in support of such action, the
right to execute a search is more rigidly defined? so that this
was the first time that he had claimed, to my knowledge, that
there was an improper activity in moving exit of the cfas station
and across, next to the automobile.
And again, as far as the final action in the — of
the officer in reaching in and seising the pistol, X think that
the one. sentence of the Chief Justice, in th© Terry case, that
it would be unreasonable to require that police officers take
unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties, was
completely applicable to the activity of Sergeant Connolly in
doing what he did.

As I urged in my earlier argument, 2 think

it's a balance of the intrusion involved as against the
possibility of a substantial injury or a violent crime upon
himself.
And I think that the election which he did was
completely valid.
Thank you.

62
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
