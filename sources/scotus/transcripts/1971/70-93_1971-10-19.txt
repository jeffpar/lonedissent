ORAL ARGUMENT QP LAWRENCE G0 WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF Op THE PETITIONER
MR, WALLACE:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may It please

the Court:
In this case, the district Court on jurisdictional

■

Court

rent in all respects.
There has been no decision here on the merits of
the Board 'a claim and there have been no findings of fact on
which a decision on the merits would ordinarily be predicated.
The decision was made on the complaint and on the
motion for the injunction.
The complaint is set forth beginning at page -4 of
the Appendix,
practice charge
,i ici
C e,,:

In it the Board recites that unfair labor
had been filed with the Board by the union

is ;; peer .■ in1 ere as amicus, the Amalgamated Meat
Union, a,-/' inst the respondent company, and that on

the basis of this charge a trial 'ey a miner of the Board had
.. tl

;he co

any bad

lols

;he' National Labor

.'ations Act in several respects;

f it

i sis t to

ia,'- r. in v-.ith the ur.ion and by committing certain other unfair
labor practices relating to the union’s organisational cam­
paign .
J- should say, incidentally, that after the present
suit was filed, as the briefs point out, the Board in ruling
on the company's exceptions disagreed with the hearing exam­
iner concerning the refusal to bargain, and held that the
union had not established majority status.

But the Board did

agree that the company had committed certain other unfair
labor practices and issued a cease and desist' order with'
hich the company has complied, and there is no question
here about enforcement of the Board's order.
The complaint further recited that approximately
vie month after the issuance of the hearing examiner’s deci­
sion employees of the company began to picket the company's
stores and the company went into the State Court and obtained
an injunction against the picketing.
A copy of the injunction was amended as an exhibit

to the Board's complaint,
Q

The issue in this case doesn't — the

resolution of the issue in this case, at least in your
submission, doesn't really depend at ail on the ultimate

outcome of anything in the Board's administrative proceed in;;,-:;
does it?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct* Your Honor.

This is strictly a question of whether there is
juridcticn in the district Court to hear the Board's complaint
for an injunction against enforcement of the State Court's
injunction by the company.
Q

As' you say* the merits even on the complaint

for injunction haven't been litigated and are not before us.
MR. Vll.L-L.kGE:

That is our view.

We have asked to

have the case remanded for a hearing on the merits of the
Board's c omplaint.
Only the jurisdictional question has been decided
below„

We don't think the case is right for adjudication

on the merits of whether the injunction should issue.

There

have been no factual findings.
Q

Mr, Wallace* would the hearing in District

Court which you suggest merely go to whether or not the
•ctivities that have beta enjoined are arguably protected or
would you say the district Court could decide then and there
whether they actually were protected or not?
MR. WALiACE:
cv, if feed tc the question

Well, that question is very closely
i.-.fc divided the Court in the

iriqdnc. c8se in 39? H.B -«*
Q

That's v;hv I am asking; it.

6
i'R, -ALLtCh:

V, ■ . r th-3 aciapl. in'■. in 'KjcOK^ncs

with the majority opinion in Ariadne the complaint was put
in terms of the activities being arguably protected or arguably
prohibited.
•

•

1

Q

j

do that if it were — so if you were in a

position to be arguably protective, the District Court should
enjoin the State Court proceeding,
MR, WALLACE:

Well, we understand that to be the

law under Garner -Q

oven though there is no way of getting the

;*.S:.-ue before the Board to see whether it is actually pro­
tected?
MR, WALLACE:

Well., that's what we understand the

lr.v, to be, Mr, Justice»
Q

1 just want to know*

MR, WALLACE:

And there is no occasion at this

stage of the present case to reach that issue because under
either view taken in Ariadne we think the same disposition
would, be appropriate here.
Now in its prayer for relief, the Board was quite
specific in stating that it wished to have enjoined the en­
forcement of those portions of the State Court injunction
that were within the preempted area in the Board’s view,
re; kbcse portions are more specifically set out in the
ot

liaiinary injunction-which is set

forth in the Appendix on pages 33 and 34 of jour Appendix,

There is a quotation of portions of the injunction
•which the Board seeks to have the enforcement of enjoined.
And there are several ellipses in the quoted portion.
Numbered 13 2 and 3.
The- first occurs at the beginning of Part 2 and
then Subparts (a) and (b) of Part 2 are omitted, and then
there is another ellipsis in Part 3*

These ellipses are

those parts of the order referring to the blocking of egress
or Ingress tc the premises of the company, to interference
with the flow of traffic or to the stationing of more than
two pickets at any one store owned by the company.

do there has been no attempt here to oust the
State Court of jurisdiction or to entirely supersede the
State Court's injunctioni

And nowhere in the prayer for

relief is there any contention raised that the State statutes
nco

ional

other -.vroviaion.

er

■

There is no declaratory judgment about the

ccnabibufcicnrlifcy the State statutes sought, nor any broad
injunction against enforcement of the State statutes.
Those issues are mooted in amicus briefs in this
Court in the case with a suggestion that the abstention
doctrine might come into play before a Federal Court should
involve itself in that question*

But the question has not

been put before the District Court in the complaint or in tie

8
motion for a preliminary injunction, and the question is not
here as we see the case.
Q

What about Youn^er.^againi^t Harris sort of an

approach or Atlantic Coastline?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, we have emphasized in our brief

that we think cases concerning private litigation between
l

private parties stand aside from the issue here, which is the
issue under the belter Minerals doctrine.
Q

Co If this were a private party trying to get

the Federal Court injunction, the Younger case might well ~~
MR, WALLACE;

Might well control—

Even though there is no State criminal

statute involved?
MR, WALLACE:

X don't believe the Younger case

would be the most closely in point.

I think the Richmond

Brothers case would be more closely in point, but
Q

And the Mitchum ease that's vet to be heard

this year.
MR, WALLACE:
Q

X -am unfamiliar with that ease,

Is It common ground between you and your

brother counsel on the other side that if the plaintiff here
Uni

America there would be no juris/

dictional bar and that if the plaintiff were John Jones there
would be a jurisdictional bar?

And the plaintiff in fact is

the Ear. ion a A Labor Relations Board and that's what makes this

9
ASWSUit,
MR, WALLACE:

x

think that '3 very accurately stated:»

Your Honor,
There is no dispute by anyone in this case that
if this suit had been brought in the name of the United
■States the He Iter Mine ra I s case would be controlling.

And I

think it is very difficult to read the Lelter Minerals case
#

any other way.
Q

I am sure that’s conceded, at least in his

brief, as 1 read it, by your brother counsel,
MjR, WALLACE:

That is my understanding.

In fact,

the only qualification of belter Minerals in this sense
that’s raised in the whole case is in our own brief, in which

ve point out that when the United States is suing not to
ore beet the public intereat but in pursuit only of a priva te
interest, it has a duty to pursue, the Court has refused to
extend the Lelter. ttlneraig exception to that kind of case.
The present case isnH that kind of case and 1
don’t think we need concern ourselves here with that kind of
case.

But that is the only qualification that has been

raised in the briefs and the issue between us is whether the

dec trine is more accurately characterised, as ae like to
characterize it,as the Governmental exception, to Section
2283, or whether it applies on3

name of the United Ltates.

»hen suit is brought in the

IO

lie do not rely on any of the express exceptions
in Section 2*.83.

We find outs elves unable to in face of the

Court's holdings about the narrow scope of those exceptions,
C

In such cases as Richmond Brothers?

hR* MALIACU;

In Richmond Brothers and, more

recently, in-the Atlantic Coastline case.
There has been no challenge before the Board
concerning this picketing and the Board has clearly held
that the filing of a State suit in good faith to invoke
remedies under s State statute is not an unfair labor
practice, and ,is not within the scope of the Board's juris­
diction to question.
So the issue comes down to whether the Belter
Minerals exception ~~ and I do want to point cut -*»
Q

The exceptions were argued --

i d, WiLLftCS:

We did argue them,- the Board argued

then in both the district Court and the Court of Appeals but
w 've ai e boned the argument in this Court*
rejected.

The argument

It war, made as an alternative argument.

Now, I do want to point out that the holding of
Letter,Miners Is on this point seems to us clear and concise.
It is set forth on page 23 of our brief and after the
policies behind it are summarized by the Court the holding
is stated .really in the single part of the sentence that we
have at the end of the quotation:

The interpretation

XI

excluding the United 'States from the courage of the stature
seervs to us preferaf In in the context of healthy federalstate relations.
Immediately ■ leer that sentence in he Iter &ijn e ra 1 a,
a new paragraph begins with the words that the Court will
then turn to the merits of the question.

The question still

remains whether the granting of an injunction was proper in
the circumstances of this case, and any discussion in the
•-•oinicn relating to the particular facts of Loiter followed
that statement by the Court*
The interpretation of 2283 on the Jurisdictional
irpretatioi that the United States
Is excluded from the coverage of the statute.
That interpretation has stood now unchanged by
Congress for fourteen years.
Now it is, frankly, difficult for us to think of
reasons why it should make a difference in terms of the
purposes of Section 2283 or the rationale of any of these
cases, why it should make a difference whether the suit is
brought in the name of the United States- or in the name of
r. particular agency,

A recent decisio:) by the Court of Appeals for the
SC-cone Circuit seems ■

v

; in illustrate this very well.

VJe

•referred in our brief, on page 25, Note IX, to some litigation
that was then pending which has now been decided by both the

District Court and the Cow-t of 'Appeals, a case called
Unite-:' States - gainst City of New Haven.
...

——u-.-u

In- that case, a

State Court injunction had been obtained against the use of
z particular runway in the New Haven Airport.

The Federal Aviation Administration, of course, has
jurisdiction over the safety of airports and the provision of
airport services and it is part of the Executive Branch of
the Government, now a part of the department of Transportation
The Justice department, in its behalf, filed suit
in the Federal district Court to enjoin the enforcement of
that State Court injunction.; as having Invaded an area within
the province of the Federal regulatory scheme,
Q

Mr. Wallace, is the Federal Aviation Ad minis-

tratlon in that res pect different from the NLRB?
•plaintiff in this a ofion.

It is the

There, I notice, it is United

States versus -MR. WALLACih

It is different in that it decs net

have statutory authority to bring suit in its own name.
is the difference.

That

It's hard to see any other difference,

as I am about to point out.
The suit was brought and the District Court upheld
that jurisdiction within Leiter Minerals and issued a pre­
liminary injunction, and the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit recently affirmed granting of the preliminary in­
junction in a case decided August 31, 1971.- Docket Number

:>3
71-3.669, still called the United States v, the City of Mew
Haven.
Mow It seems, for purposes of the statutory policy
reflected in 2233, mere happenstance that the Federal Aviation
Administration is not empowered to sue in its own name, sues
in the name of the United States, yet other agencies which
have very comparable responsibilities for the provision of
services to the public, such as the Interstate Com r-rce
Commission, the Federal Power Commission, the Federal Com­
munications Commission, do have statutory authority to sue
in their own name, would be implementing Federal policies in
interference with Federal policies by bringing entirely com­
parable suits.
It's hard to think of any reason why there should
be a difference in result on jurisdictional grounds under
Section 2283,
Mow this does not mean that a host of new cases,

a lr.uge volume of additional litigation, would foe opening up
as a result of recognition of the scope of the Governmental
encepfcion.
It seems to us it was recognized as long ago as
denies y, Willingham, for that matter, there had been
establishment of it under the Office of Price Administration
legislation,
It is true that the opinion in that case pointed to

14
statutory authority for the administrator to seel

•

but that statutory authority did not specify that injunctions
could be sought against the enforcement of State Court judg­
ments.

And it's really not significantly different from the

statutory authority of any other agency to seek injunctions*
We have inquired of a number of agencies to deter­
mine what their experience has been in this field and most of
them have replied that they cannot recall an instance in which
they had to seek relief against a State Court Judgment where
they could not at least attempt to justify that relief within
the r ationale of the expressed exceptions in Section 2233But s everai of them did mention to us that such casea could
arise that would toe very Important to the administration of
their statutes.

And for that reason they are interested in

the outcome of this litigation*
I’ll cite just one instance: the Federal Trade
Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
both pointed out to us that under certain statutory provisions
they have an obligation to conduct investigations in secret
and to keep the matters that they investigate confidential*
And they would be concerned about possible disclosure of
c.xe of these matters in State Court proceedings and would be
rather hard pressed to justify relief under the expressed
exceptions to 2203 in such a circumstance.
arisen, but it could arise.

It hasn’t yet

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission points
out its particular concern because of the statutory policy
b :iiind the confidentiality of their investigations, a policy
of.protecting complainants and witnesses against reprisal and
intimidation and the like.
So there are some Important policies involved here.
Q

Mr, Wallace, could I ask you, in dealing with

the Morris-LsGuard la Acts and the National Labor Relations
Board, has the Board's right to get an injunction despite
the Morris-LaGuaydia Act rested on specific statutory

exemption?
MR» WALLACE;
exemption*

I know of no specific Statutory

1 didn't think the terms of the Norris-LaGuardia

Act applied to the Board.
Q

Well, 1 notice on page 41 of your brief,

s i3c>. r.u bury provision,

etoc-'t sirs,

?Upon the filing of any such petition fi

"District Court shall have jurisdiction to grant

such injunctive relief .

,

, notwithstanding any other pro

vision of lavs.” D.oesv/t that express
MR* WALLACE:
orders.

Well, that's in enforcing Board

This is not a proceeding brought:under that pro­

vision*
Q
provisions ,-

I am just wondering.

Aren't there comparable-

I don't remember them but 1 thought wherever

the Board has been given authority to seek .injunctive relief

there has usually been added' something like this notwithstanding any other provision of law.
Q

Nov;, if your position is'correct , it wouldn’t

have been necessary at all to provide for that exemption
from Morris-iaGuardia, because Norris-LaGuardia doesn't apply
to the United States at all*
MR. WALLACE:

Nell, that’s an issue that 2 don't

think need be reached in this case.
Q

Well, it might have a lot to do with whether

Congress intended 'Morris

the Board to exercise the author­

ity of the United States,

If outside these specific areas

where the Board can get injunctions, if outside that area
Norris-LaGuardia would bar the injunction of the Board, then
the Board isn’t the United States.
MR* WALLACE:

Of course, I think there is initially

a serious "question whether Norris-LaGuardia would have any
applicability to an Injunction against just any enforcement

•: a State Court judgment, rather than an injunction that
goes to the conduct of the
Q

Quite a labor dispute.

MR, WALLACE:

Well, it is, but it*8 a very limited

scopo of an injunction and doesn’t seem to me the kind of
interference with the settlement of labor disputes that
Norris-LaGuardia was concerned with.

Indeed, this kind of

injunction seems to us to further the policies of Norris-

IT
LaGuardia, by preventing State Court interference with the
peaceful s ettlem'ent of labor* disputes.
Well, I think one other statutory provision might
be pointed out as an example of the immateriality even to
Congress of this distinction, that is a provision of the
Interstate Commerce Act which is

the particular provision

Is — entitled 49 of the Code, Section 16, Subsection 12,
entitled, "Proceedings to Enforce Orders Other 5hen for
Payment of honey,"
And there the statute provides: if any carrier
fails cr neglects to obey any order of the Commission other
than for the payment of money, while the order is in effect,
the Interstate Commerce Commission or any party injured
thereby, or the United States, by its Attorney General., may
apply to any district Court of the United States for the
enforcement of the order — any district Court of competent
Jurisdiction.,
Vhfi'r.

just an example of Congress5 attitude that

its policies and its statutes are to be enforced by whoever
has the litigating authority, in that case, and the alternafclve by the United Stated or by the Interstate Commerce
Commission,
It's difficult for us to see the materiality of

entertained, other than leaving the matter to private litiga­
tion entirely which seems ’ansatisfactory in light of its
responsibilities»

The re-are only two possibilities.

One is

to seek to intervene or to participate as a rate? u s curiae in
the State Court proceedings.
Whether it could intervene, since no order of the
Beard is at issue, would be highly questionable.

If it could

not participate as a party intervenor then whether an appeal
would be taken would be out of its hands.

In addition, even

if it could participate, it would be subjected to the possible
pitfalls of unfamiliar State procedure, the possible limita­
tions of State discovery proceedings and other disadvantages
in comparison with the Federal forum where Congress contem­
plated it would be doing its litigating.
The other possible alternative is the suggestion
that was raised in the Court’s opinion in Richmond Brothers
that perhaps the filing of a State Court proceeding that
interferes with the area preempted by the National Labor
delations Act might itself b.e an unfair labor practice.
The Board, as we have pointed out in our brief,
has or3 careful consideration rejected this position,

When

a suit is brought in good faith in a State Court to invoke
remedies provided for by State statute, and it seems to us
that for the 'Board to hold that a good faith suit in such
circumstances could be brought only at the risk of being held

20

to have committed an unfair labor practice, would be a far
-...•caber Intrusion on the prerogatives of the State and the
dignity of State procedures to prevent even the invoking
in good faith of State remedies than is the settled inter/
_
pretation as we understand it of Section 2283*
I would like to reserve the remainder of ray time

for rebuts1,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A „ BARGING, SSQ„,
ON BEHALF QP THE RESPONDENT
MR. HARDIER:

Mr , Chief Justice, Your Honors, may

it please the Court:
. This case la but another exa u?Ie o.f the continual
pal.lure of the Labor Board to acknowledge that the Congress
meant what it said when it passed the anti-injunction statute

21

and noted that Federal District Courts do not have the power*
Indeed they are prohibited from enjoining State Court pro­
ceedings unless specifically in aid of their own jurisdiction

\.:.i order to effectuate their own judgments* or where specific*»
ally provided for by Congress.
Of course, this prohibition and these exceptions
are found in 28 U.S, Code 2283* and that is the heart and
basis of this case.
Q

Of course, this Court has already said that

those words den *t mean exactly what they say as in Dei ter
Minerals.
Mil, BABYING:

Yes, Your lienor, but that wasn't so

.much that they .don't mean what they say as they'haven't said
enough.
That they haven't said enough, that there is
:n>o;.i.-sr exception in addition to those specified in 2233 ?•
MR, HAEDIMG:

Yes, Your Honor, and I would like to

e:- fierce for this Court that United States exception that the
Board talks about, as well as a few other reasons why we
believe- this Court should affirm the decisions of the lower
courts In denying to the Board the relief it requests.
But before I do up, 1 would like to emphasise a
few facts that the Board took care not to emphasize, and one
that was incorrect,
First, the Board incorrectly noted in oral argument

that the employees of the Hash-Finch Company were striking
the summer of '12-59«»

This la incorrect anti the Board

complaint does not say that*

*&

The Board’s complaint, Part

6,

noted on. page 5 of the Appendix, specifically notes that the
union began picketing*

And as noted in affidavits attached

as an Appendix to our brief, in support of our petition in
•/

•

the State Court, clearly point out the pickets were not
employees.

Therefore, It was understandable that the company

would not have cosy access to the names or identity of those

3opie

and that

;ate Court therefore required that any-

oca that was being presumably paid by the union to corns and
picket would first come to the ata'te Court, Identify themselves, and submit to its jurisdiction.
So these were not employees'. These were presumably
paid union personnel that were conducting the picketing,
Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, the
picketing in the instant case, is acknowledged and judicially
has been determined as mass picketing.

On the one'hand, we will have peaceful picketing
r,on the other end of the spectrum we have nonpeaceful
picketin'.".

In between the picketing that may be either or
j

oi kw

•

a type of picketing that most State Courts have

passed statutes regarding, and which they refer to as mass
picketing *
In implementing its duty under its State police

S3
povasr to protect the rights of its citizens and to make the
conclusion that they may not be hampered by any type of
picketing that would prohibit ingress and egress or lead to
violence, most States prohibit, as does Nebraska statute,

the numbers of pickets that may be placed, and specifically
states that they nay not prohibit the ingress and egress.
The Nebraska statute has a few other factors in
it, but suffice it to say that the affidavits which we sub­
mitted in the State Court which are set forth in Appendix to
our brief, indicate that there was substantial blocking of
ingress and egress by these non-employee pickets, that there
were substantially more than the numbers allowed by the State
statute.

There were also some other areas of some threats

to both customers of the store and store employees

,

but

suffice it to say, Your Honors, the Board comes before this

. . e*

' io is!

;his is

l p id:

and it is not.

There is

judicial determination it is mass

picketing and there is a world of difference, because if it
is peaceful picketing i nly the company acknowledges that ther-a
is obviously at least an arguable, at least an arguable,
conclusion that the

s.-.-evkng is therefore totally, complete!.;

governed by the Nation*1 tutor Relations Act and the Board.
However,

if it is mass picketing, there is a very

substantial state interest involved under the State police

24

powers, And that’s what we have at issue in this case.
Your Honors* that State police power versus what the Board
would oak this .Court to- do, which is to imply to it an
accept ion on the basis of Federal preemption to that it my
into crpy Federal District Oc-urt, anywhere in the country*
raid get an injunction of any State implementing its police
newer.u as regards mass picketing.
How we also note in .our brief, Your Honors * that
it*o true we’ve never had any holding on the merits, there
has never been any findings of fact by the Federal District
Court.
Unfortunately, we were.not really-in a position to
be vitally concerned about this as we already had our
judicial determination it was mass picketing.

Ws thought

that took care of.the issue.
'The Board was the moving party in the Federal
DiUu victf Court, and made no effort to place any of those
fetore the Court and, as noted in oral argument, the
ea.:-;; . d determined on our motion to dismiss* and it v-aa
affirmed by the Eighth Circuit*
But there are Police Department, Fire.Department
reoords, records of the State Department of Agriculture,
which me note in our brief that we believe this Court could
take judicial notice of which indicate that there were sub­
stantially other activities that could properly ba used to

classify this picketing as violent,
Q

May 1 ask, Mr* Harding, cross any of this bear

on the issue before us, namely* whether there was jurisdiction
in the District Court to entertain this complaint?
MR* HARD IMG;

Ho, Your Honor, as we know it.

If

the District Court was correct that it didn’t have juris­
diction, it doesn’t make a bit of difference.
Q

I mean that the facts that you are telling

me really don’t bear on that question at all.
Mil. KAHPIHG:

No, Your Honor, but the Board seems

be thirl, that they do, because the Board says that they should
have an exception implied for them*
Notwithstanding the United States exception,
their argument goes on to say, we feel that this Court on
the basis of Federal preemption alone, an argument which was
rejected by this Court both in the Richmond
Brothers
case
........
.
and last year in Atlantic Coastline ha,

on the basis of pre­

emption alone, should allow the Board or any other Federal
agency to go into district Court.
We don’t agree with that and we don’t believe this
Court toes.

But X understood you to concede a few minutes

ing you would be out of Court

MR, HMD BIG;

Only to the extent, Your Honor, the:t

the Board has made this os the basis of its argument before
this Court as to why it should have had jurisdiction given to
the District Court and in our counterargument to that fact
we are only noting that if this Court should consider this
preemption argument of the Board that it should also consider
mj.erc are a few other things than just peaceful picketing*
But we believe the issue can be disposed of by the
o 'dicial determination in the State Court that thin was mass
picketing, not peaceful picketing.
Q

Yes, but wouldn’t you be making the same

■.r&ument here ev ’.r> if there was nothing involved in

Court would have no power under 2283 to enjoin a State Court

It Isn’t?

Well, I would think it would be

before the Court a:; to whether the ~~ the issue is whether
the Federal Court had power to enjoin any part of the State
Court injunction.

MR. KAfiuJNQs

Well* the reason 1 say I don't believe

it’s properly before this Court is because the Board can't
adequately get around the limitations of 2283» and it could
have and should have proceeded in the State Court, - and could
have amply taken care of its problems there.
There are a number of reasons why wo believe that
this Court should: conclude that the Lower Court was correct
in what it did,
I’d like to first draw the Court’s attention to the
statutory framework in which Section 2283 appeared to the
.0 is t ric t C ou rt»
As has been noted by this Court in previous
questions,- the Norris-iaGuardia Act indicates that Federal
district Courts- are not encouraged to grant injunctive relief
in labor matters.

29 U*S, Cede, Sections 101 and 104 indicate

that they should not.

In fact Sections 107 and- 109 indicate

shat they should make detailed findings of fact before they
would ever enter such an- area of granting injunctive relief*
But notwithstanding that fact, 29 U.S, Code, Section

■to,

usually referred to as Sections 10(j) ana 10(1) of the

let, gives‘to the Labor Board the power to go In In certain
situations, into Federal District Court and obtain injunctive

ve'lXoS if they feel it’s an extraordinary circumstance where
they should exercise- that power and go in and get that in/lunet :ton,

In addition to that, of course* we have 28 U.S,
Code 2283> which has been law in some form since 1793*

And

I submit to the Court, Your Honors, that the distinction is
somewhat more basic than that*

Even as has been noted in

the amicus brief by the National Chamber of Commerce and in
our brief,, that this has been

0

longstanding implementation

of the notion in Congress that there should and must be a
dual Court system in this country,
X direct Your Honors 5 attention to the Federalists
Papers, which we note in our brief, by Mr. Madison, wherein
hr indicates that there is an even deeper division than that
\
■
........
because when the people of this country,who are the sovereign
gave to the new Federal Government its .power to do what they
alllcr.ec it to do, that there was considerable concern ever

whot that Federal Government might do to the State Govern­
ments .
Mr. Madison notes quite clearly in Number 46 that
if there is an area where a State Court infringes on an area
that

the Federal Government thinks is unfriendly to it, that

notwithstanding that fact, the States must clearly have the
.advantage.

And the reason in that is because the States were

giving the power to the Federal Government and that they must

30
.maintain that advantage.
So we would say that Section 2283 came before the
District. Court with the very, very basic distinction between
the Federal and the State Court Judicial systems.
Based upon that, the State action in giving the
coiroSiT

relief and redress under the State Eass Picketing

statute, is certainly not for this Court on the grounds that
that is not within their power, for as noted in numerous
decisions before this Court as set out in our brief on page
13» this Court

3;many times noted that regulation of mass

picketing by .State Courts and by State statutes is clearly
and completely within the province of the State police power.
It was upon this statutory framework then that this
ratter reached the Federal District Court.

At that point,

the Board raised Its two arguments that it, number one, should
fe-i considered the United States for the purposes of this
action and get around Section 2283 and that, two, it could be
corn; leered to get cround Section 2283 simply because It had
..--3tablished by the Congress, I suppose.

MR* KARililG:

< m n ot a wa re: • : a t -it d id , You

Honor«
This Court noted in the City of El Faso case in
1965 about the broad powers of State police powers that Stab

should be granted wide discretion in determining how to
exercise those State police powers. And Ev, Justice Reedv,
.
in jilt tars Cafe in 1942, noted specifically that there was
no serious 'question that States had the power, to place a good
deal of regulation on

os picketing, to regulate the nuuboon

and to regulate the blacking of Ingress and egress, etcetera*
The basic argument that the Labor Board brings
■ -e this Court that it ahoulo be considered- the United
3totes, seems to have been decided by this Court’s decision
in the .-Mat has on case, 34-4 U*S., wherein it was noted that o
debt, and in that situation a back cay proceeding that was
owed to the Labor Board v as not entitled to preference as a
debt owed to the United States would be.
Nevertheless, this case is still before the Court'
because the Board maintains that it should' be considered the
United States because there is no reason to consider that it
would not be.
But, Your Honors, of course, it is recognized that
i

of limited powers and

it is also a government of specific powers.

The Labor Board

32
:vbeblished not _ to be the United States for all intents
\;c purposes . at ve■ • established to be a specific agency of
the Government, to enforce a specific statute under specific
policy directives of the Congress,
I don’t believe that the Congress intended to make
the Labor Board into rchat might be referred to as a Franken­
stein {s monster in that it could go across the entire country
doing what it liked and considering that It had the powers,
immunities and privileges of the United States*
Indeed, this Court has noted previously in cases
very similar that agencies of the United States Government,
os rioted in'the Menlhan case,which vie note in our brief on
i/

a20 and page 23, that this Court has previously concluded
;.br t
r

■

. ancles of the United States are not to be considered to
'

• ;d •'••o possess the powers, privileges and immunities of

feb • Unit'd States unless the Congress clearly grants that
power to them*
Your Honors, the Bor.rd points to no specific
statutory authority for their claim that they may be con­
sidered the United Jtates for the purposes of this action.
Indeed, all they want to do is circumvent another
specific statutory provision, which is 2283.

Yet they point

to no specific statute granting them that power.
They do point to what they refer to as implied
ear cep felons undor forme- section blip.

In our brief,, as we noted . as this Court noted in
the Richmond Brothers case, there is no need really to conside
those Implied exceptions because it's clear that the Congress
did not intend for any implied exceptions to live beyond the
enactment of Section 2283.

But for argument’s sake- it should

be noted that the cases the Board relies upon are not really
coses wherein there were judicially implied exceptions be­
cause there was in fact conflicting statutory authority*
In four of the cases the Board relies upon, that
authority was granted by section 205 {c) of Emergency Price
Control Act*

The most noted of those cases is Bowles v>

Willingham,
In fact, it's notable that approximately ten days
ago the Government went down the street to argue in the
district of Columbia Circuit and told Judge Leventhal that
the Bov:les v, Willingham case specifically gave the President
the power to do what he is doing now in the wage-price con­
trol freer.e because it was an emergency statute and they
used Bowles as a basis for their case.

Yet they come into

this Court today and argue that the Bowles case is just a
clear indication of the fact that any Government agency can
be given the power to be the United States under the rather
broad argument of Federal preemption, and make no mention of
the fact that that was an emergency price control act»

That

was not a regulation statute as we would note in the general

senae of the word.
However, two'additional cases cited by the Board in
its brief specifically gave jurisdiction to Federal district
Courts under Section 79 (k) of the Public Utilities fielding Act,
The final case cited by'the Board as a■ presumed
exception under former Section 265 was given specific .authority
— gave specific jurisdiction to the district Court under the
Agricultural Marketing Act, Section 6.
do the Board comes before this Court not with
implied judicial exceptions but with conflicting statutory
authority under, prior ejection 265.

And that, Your Honors,

as was noted in the revisor's notes of .Section 2283, was why
the Congreys passed Section 2233*

They had'to get their house

in ord'e- end note specifically when jurisdiction was granted
if

>

' • '

'

‘

to a Federal uistriet Court, • And they took care of that by
placing the first exception under section 2283 > the words:
except where specifically authorized by Congress.
Mow the Beard is specifically authorised by Congress
under Section 10{j) and I0(l) to seek and'to obtain injunctive
relief, but those sections do not apply to this case as the
Boa rd a c k n ow 1 ed ges i

V'e submit, Your Honors, that had the Congress in«
tend ed to give the Board the power to get injunctive relief
ii other s it actions it would have said so,
.r

Every place where

hre given the Board power, it has Specified that power.

35
Especially, Your Honors* in the area of injunctive relief*
which sight be distinguished from rather more administrative
powers which the Board notes in its brief that* of course,
not ail of the powers to implement that statute were given to
the Board in the statute,

Of course not,

Not as far as

administrative matters would be concerned.
But when it comes to an injunctive power, those
powers have been specific in their implementation by. the
Congress and we would submit that since 10(j) and 10(1) do
not apply to this case the Board has no statutory power to
attempt to get the injunction that it .seeks.
Now in addition, in oral argument, the Board notes
vjhat the Respondent will rely upon for another indication of
why the Board should not be before this Court claiming to be
he United Btabes.

49 U.S. Cede, Section 3.6, dealing with

the pc..era of the ICC us the Board noted, specifically says
;,!-'-t

implement those statutes either the ICC may do so,

any r .rieved party or the United Bfcates.
It is fairly obvious that the Congress need not
have said the ICC or United States if there was no difference,
But the regulatory agencies of the Government are not parts
of the executive Branch of the Government.

It is specifically

noted in even the Government organizational manual put out
by the Government Printing office, that there, is a distinction

between branches of the Executive Government and regulatory

agencies.

In fact, there are • 51 regulatory agencies, in­

cluding the Labor Board. Hated Sc administrative agencies

Unit fed states, it should be allowed to proceed in this case
sImply because it was established by the Congress, it has pre­

•That argument was advanced also in the Richmond'

Justice Frankfurter noted in that case that

that argument must be rejected because simply because Federal

are an agency of the Federal Government, that;

they have work of a Federal nature to do.

What we do say,

though, is that that work of a Federal nature to do has been
specifically granted to them anti at least'as-.regards'the
injunctive power, the power that the Congress does not wish
exercised by Federal district Courts in labor matters
generally, that the Congress has been careful to only grant
1 x-.dted power to the labor Board to proceed for injunctive
relief*

And that that power has not been given to the Board

to circumvent the limitations of 2283*
From a practical standpoint, the argument of prothe U bor Board really attempts to get the cart
before the horse, tecarse what it tries to do is to get the
omits of the case in : etc >a jurisdiction is initially granted
fad this, of course, v.ws why the -district Court denied the
jurisdictional claims of

he Board.

In fact, as we noted in

our brief, later Mr. Justice Cardoso when he was deciding
cases for the State of Mew York noted that rights exist and.
that they may be granted after jurisdiction has been found,
out that rights in end of themselves may not confer

59
jurisdiction.
This is what the Board would seek to have this
do,
There are additional practical reasons to conclude
that the Labor Board should not properly he before this Court
seeking to circumvent the limitations of Section 2233®

They

go beyond the system of dual courts that has long been estab­
lished and that is because the Labor Board does not even
exercise the power that it is granted under Sections 10{j}
and 10(l), as we noted in our brief*

In over 75$ of what it acknowledges to be meritori­
ous coses, it does not seek to obtain injunctive relief.
It is rather anomalous then that the Board comes
before this Court and urges this Court to comply and to
judicially legislate a power that the Congress has not
granted to it.
For all of these reasons then we urge this Court
to again strictly construe Section 2283 to conclude that the
Board may not on a basis of Federal preemption alone circum­
vent the limitations of Section 2283 and to affirm the lower
Court.

MR* WJbbirC.E:

X. would j! st like to say a word or two.about soiis C;
of the cases' relied on by the. Respondent, .particularly,
Mat bans en v, The National. .la tor Folati;

...

this Court in construing the Bankruptcy Act .decided that an
award of back pay owing to the labor Board while it was a
debt owing to the labor Board was functionally in the category of wages i:\"' i

to worl men rather than a sum of money

owing to the treasury of the United States, and should
accordingly. be awarded the priority of wages rather than of
debts owing to the United States for purposes of applying the
-... . :• •; toy Act.
It1 s hrrd f( ■ re to think that any different result

. v,.;

*ehi ic

to the United States but to be used for the. same

purpose,
The reasoning of the Court was that this was not a
payment to go into the Federal Treasury,
Reconstruction.Finance Corporation v... Menihan was
■. case in which the Court held that the corporation- dis­
tinguished from federal

ci

■

which had statutory

authority to sue and be sued like other corporations, should
not core within the statutory provision exempting, the United

States from interest payment in.litigation, but the ordinary
rules of litigation should apply.
The National Labor Relations Board and ether Federal
agencies were for years operating under the Federal pro­

vision

exempting the. United States from interest- payments and

were not paying interest in litigation»
the

And it's only since

. ..ft. ent of tint, .-'••■•.-ovislon with respect to all litigation

by the United dtates that this practice has changed for the
n.eneies in that respect.
Now if there is any further question about the
Norris-LaGuardia Act in this matter, I am informed that the
Board did brief the question of why the Morris-LaGuardia mot
should not apply in this kind of case,

It is either in the

Capital Service case or in the .Richmond Brothers ■ we don’t
recall which brief it was, but it was in one of those briefs,

authority to seek injunctive relief where it has added some­
thing notwithstanding any other provision of law or, I .think,
in the '35 act, notwithstanding, the provisions of 101 to .113®
Now don't you think there is some significance in
