MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

Mr. Shea, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MICHAEL SHEA, ESQ.»
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHEA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The petitioner in this case was arrested in January
of 1370 in Leon County, Florida, for the crime of carrying a
concealed weapon* punishable in Florida by imprisonment for six
months or a fine of $1,000.
He was arraigned and plead guilty the next day, and
was sentenced to ninety days or $500 fine.
An original petition was filed in the Supreme Court
of Florida the same month, and that court rendered its decision
in June of the same year.
The court, although establishing a new rule for
Florida, denied the petitioner's right to counsel.
Cert has been granted by this Court, and it is our
contention' that a person charged with any crime should be given
the right to counsel, even in & situation where he is indigent.
Q

I didn't get, Mr. Shea, clearly, just what was

it you said about the change in the handling of these cases in
Florida.

It was

<•* err* 'I?
S

4
MR. SHEA;

Yes, sir,,

Originally, before the Argersinger case, the rule was
Fish vs. State, which was decided in Florida in 19G4, and in
•that case the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the right to
counsel, as decided in this case, only applied to felonies.
Kowf since then, they have upheld that several times, but than
changed their mind in a 4-3 decision of this case, in the
lower — in the June decision»

And now we have a more-then-

six-month rule in Florida*
And this defendant, then, lost by one day.
Q

That is, no matter what the label may be on the

offense, if it carries six months or more —
MR. SHEAs
Q

Ho, Ycur Honor —

No?

MR* SHEA%

If it carries more than six months.

Ho

matter what the length.
Q

That*9 what I say, if it carries,more than .sis

months, —

■ MR. SHEA;
Q

Yes, sir.

—■ then under Florida law now counsel must be

provided? is that it?
MR. SHEA;
Q

Yes, sir.

And before that, in the law **~ the rule of the

Fish case in Florida was that counsel may not be provided except
in felony cases.

Is that it?

s
MR„ SHEA?
Q

that's correct. Your: Honor.

In Florida.

And how are felonies defined in

Florida?
HR. SHEA:
Q

A year.

MR. SHEA:
Q

Incarceration in the State —

*— penitentiary?

MR. SHEA:
Q

Yes, sir.

Or more than one year,

MR. SHEA:
Q

Incarceration for more than one year.

Yes, sir.

Rather than in jail.

MR. SHEA:

We have some misdemeanors in Florida

where a person can be incarcerated for more than a year, but
that would bo in e. situation where they would foe kept, in a
county facility.

So it's possible in Florida to he incarcerated

for e. laisdexaeanor for more than a year.
Q

But, I gather, if the offense is limited to

r-ore than six months but less than a year, is it still labeled

i minds'.‘.sanor, or do you have other labels?
MR, SUSA:

Mo, sir? it's labeled a misdemeanor.

Although, if it's a municipal violation, then if would he a
municipal violation.
Q

And then suppose it carried over six months?

MR. SHEA:

decision from Florida, that the rule would apply

MR. SHEA*

They're called city ordinances or -«

ordinances if it's a city violation.

And the same ordinance

would b® a traffic violation in the State court*
Q

Under State law?

MR. $HEA:
Q

Yes, sir.,

So row you understand this recent decision as

meaning in all those instances counsel would have to be
provided?
MR. SHEA*

yes, sir.

And X think that the question

of the difference between the terminologies has probably been
laid to rest with this Court’s decision of Wall.

And this has led to a

great deal of confusio;?, in our State, and some of the other
States in our Circuit.

Presently there are quite a number of

habeas corpuses in Federal Courts which are pending the
decision of this Court in this case.

There has been a Federal

Judge in Jacksonville , which has ordered one of our counties
in that area to have their J.P.'s inform all defendants that
they have right to counsel.

This was in the form of an

injunction.
In my hometown, in the City of Tampa, our Federal
Judge hu.3 reserved ruling on a case before him requiring the
municipal court judges to inform defendants of their right to
counsel.

We have a situation where we ~Q

Q

Well, even for & parking ticket?

I suggest, Your Honor, that there has been

a long time since —

Ho, I’m just wondering —« I'm asking about a

MR. SHEAt

Yes, sir.

They have been, directed to inform indigent

defendants of their right to counsel in what kind of cases?
MR. SHEAs

Ho., that’s what the suit's about.

The

We do have three judges# 1 was about to say# and one of them
informs of the right and the other two do not.

prison for a parking ticket violation, but not the violation

10
MR. SHEAi

Yes.

Right.

0

A hundred parking tickets or so.

Q

Well, one last question.

MRo SHEAz
Q

Yes, sir.

Is your submission to us,-then, that the

Constitution requires provision for counsel in every case where
the crime charged may carry a prison sentence, however long or
however short?
MR. SHEA?

Yes, sir? that’s our position.

1 have

a closing statement that we’ll-make specifically to that point.
I think the Constitution is clear on that.

It says, in Article

VI that in all criminal prosecutions, where a person may have
the right to the assistance of counsel for the defense,
1 think that's absolutely clear.
And it makes no limitation on the parson's income.
0

Well, of course, that's the Sixth Amendment.

MR. SHEA:
Q

Yes, sir.

You're talking about the Fourteenth Amendment.

MR. SHEA:

Yes, sir.

And 1 think we have to assume that the Fourteenth
Amendment applies to the State of Florida and the districts -**Q

Well, it certainly does,

MR. SHEA:
0

Yes, sir.

Wa can all agree on that.

MR. SHEA?

I'm glad — sometimes I wonder if some of

11
our judges realise that*
{Laughter.)
If 1 may continue on ~~

Q

But the Sixth amendment to which yon refer «.Iso

provide ;:' for an impartial jury; and have we held that an
impartial jury is essential for any case in which imprisonment
is a possible punishment?
MR* SHEA;

Kfof sir.

I think the distinction between

the Sixth Amendment rights are quite different, though, in the
mere fact that this Court has chosen to treat jury trials
differently is of no bearing on the right to counsel*

X think

that we can say that a fair trial can be had in this country
without a jury.

We’ve been doing it for quite some time, and

I don’t feel that it’s an essential element to a trial.
But in an adversary system, where the State is
providing a prosecutor, it’s completely unthinkable to expect
a defendant to get up and defend himself and then say that the
trial is fair.
And x would-also add that the other rights, as outlined
in the Sixth Amendment* are not restricted as is the jury trial.

X think this wae adequately even pointed out in the decision
that Your Honor is speaking of.

I think Justice White, when

he wrote Baldwin, said that indeed the prospect of imprisonment,
for however short a time, will seldom be viewed by the accused
as a trivial or petty matter, and may well result .in quite

various defects to the defendant
If we look to the various Statesf we find that the
question is..' as was in Gideon, quite unclear.

We would offer,

thouc/h, that the ~~ our position is not one that’s impossible*
Thera are twt States at present that are currently holding our
suggested point of views

The State of Minnesota, and the State

of Mew Jersey.
I would also like to point out to the Court that in
the lower court decision of our case, we had a 4**3 decision,
and in the dissenting opinion was the Chief Justice then of the
State of Florida, Richard Irvinc who may be familiar to the
Court*

He was the Attorney General of the State of Florida

in the Gideon case, and presented that brief.
So X think it’s safe to assume that our Chief Justice
has now taken a 180-dogree turn, or -the then Chief Justice.
Q

I hope you’ll permit me a reservation about

what you say about New Jersey.
MR. SHEA*

Q

1 beg your pardon, sir?

I sayf 1 hope you’ll permit mo a reservation

about what you say about Hew Jersey*
MR. SHEA*

There have been several arguments raised against our

position.

The jury trial, as.X*v® commented on, is just on© of

The State has also pointed out in their brief that

there’s © possibility of Boykin error.

We don’t feel that there1

13
a Boykin error.

There cannot be a Boykin error unless there's

an intelligent, waiver.

There cannot be an intelligent waiver

unless the person is afforded the right to counsel.
This is an elementary thing* and must corns before we
can even consider those.
There has been a suggestion that the Criminal Justice
Act has limited the right to counsel.

It’s our position that

that Act does not limit the right to counsel.

It speaks more

specifically, if one takes a closer reading, to compensation
for counsel.

And the fact that Congress has chosen to compensate

attorneys who handle more lengthy cases and involved cases r and
not those of some of the lesser offensos, I think should have
no bearing on a constitutional right.
Q

Mr. Shea,, let ms be sure I understand you.

Did you say that there cannot foe an intelligent waiver of the
right to counsel without counsel? is this what you’re saying?
MR. SHEA:

Q

Yes, sir.

No matter hew intelligent a person is, he cannot

waive cotins e 1 ?
ME, SHEAt

No, sir, I don’t think ha can.

I think he

has to ha informed of: all -the problems, the ramifications of
what Loh. charged with, his possible defenses, and what the
possible sentence is and everything else.

And that only after

ha’s been completely advised of hi® present situation and the
possibilities that he has can he then mak® a decision.

Q

You’ve

/er been confronted with a situation

where the client knows more than the attorney?
HR. SHBA*

Yea, sir*

X*ve had a few of those*

(Laughter*)
I still advise that.
The only problem that X really see is the rules of
procedure for the trial of minor offenses before magistrates*
If we assume that those rules were, as the negative predicate
suggests, than our petitioner hare today has lost ana we
candidly suggest that.
However, it is our position that if w© are to inter­
pret that rule that way, that it is an unconstitutional, rule
and in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth.
1 would hope that this Court would not put this
question to rest with the negative predicate*
We would like to offer what wa feel is a completely
workable rule as a test for the right to counsel.

In the case

of James v*< Headley, Judge Wisdom handed down a rule which
has been most successfully used:

A defendant must be given

counsel where there is a practical possibility that he might be
sent to jail.
Now, in that we mean that in those situations, such
as hews been raised by the State of a person spitting oh a
sidewalk, of ra wing tickets, of jaywalking, and all the other
minor offenses, we suggest that these are not practical

possibilities of a person going to prison.
q

Even though the ordinance or the statute, as

the case may he# may say for that kind of offense a criminal —
rather, a prison term may be imposed, 30 days, SO days, as the
case may be?

MR. SHEA*
Q

Even though the statute says that?

MR. SHEA:
‘CO

yes.

Yes, sir. And 1 would ask them to offer

some statistics where someone did go to prison for that.
C

Well, than you’d have to coma around to the

test that has been suggested as one possibility in various
■«

reports, that counsel is required only if, generally or usual'
**v

a prison sentence is imposed.
MR. SHEA:

Is that the test you advocate?

If you're speaking of the ABA minimum

standards **~
Q

That's one of them.

MR. SHEA:

That's one of them.

Yes, sir.

I think that we would go

along with that, and say that our position is in line with that
suggested minimum standard.
Q

Wall, I thought you'd responded to a question of

Mr. Justice Stewart that in every case, if the penalty was
possible, counsel had to be provided.

The statistics just don8 '; bear out.
As a second part of cur suggested test, we would like

to say that it should foe added then —Q

Well, what happens if it never happened before,

MR. SHEA:
Q

What happens to him?

MR. SHEA;
Q

Without counsel.

No,, sir, because the second part —

Why not?

MR. SHEA:

The second part of our suggestion would

cover that.
Q

Well, how do you separate those -two' cases?

MR. SHEA: Well, if 1 may continue —
Q

I mean this —

MR. SHEAs
0

I'm addressing myself to that.

I get worried with this legality by statistics,

or constitutionality by statistics.
MR. SHEA:
Q

Yes, sir.

I get very troubled.

MR. SHEA:

The second phase of this would be that

no parson could then in fact foe sent to a jail unless he had

‘5

«'9

1 /

bee:i given right to counsel, and Z think this would take care
of that.

For many,, -many years we have had justices and judges

in our court system that have taken it upon themselves to appoint
si in situations where they felt either the magnitude of
the charge or the case itself warranted such a thing.

And

we're suggesting that this fca dona. That, in those situations
where it appears that there's a possibility of sentence , that
the right to counsel be afforded.
Q

Well, it might not appear so at the beginning of

the trial, before the triers of the fact have heard all the
evidence, and it might turn out to foe a much more aggravated
and serious situation than had appeared before the trial began»

1 take it your position would be, than, that if a conviction
was followed by a sentence to prison, and no lawyer had been
presided, then that conviction would have to be set aside and a
new trial ordered? is that it?
MR. SHEA;

Yes f sir.

We would suggest that it would

be better to set a rule of this natura, saying that if there is
a possibility of a sentence, that he must be given the right to
counsel from the outset.

If that decision is made, one way or

the other, and he is not given that attorney, then he may not
be sent to prison even though the facts may develop, as you havesuggested,

*
Q

Well, or if he is sent to prison, then,

and

maybe it turns out that there was a very good reason why he

IS
would be sent to prison, from the point of view of the gravity
or seriousness or outrageouaness of the conduct»

But that then

a new trial should bo ordered, and at this time ha gets a
lawyer? is that it?
MR, SEEAs
Q

Yes, sir,

Would that pose any double jeopardy problems if

he didn't consent to the new trial?
MR, SHEA:

I would have to admit there is a

possibility,
Q
he appealed,

I suppose a new trial wouldn't be ordered unless
I’d assume that he would have appealed.

MR, SHEAt

Yes? sir, I would, too.

And 1 think that in actual practice of it, in speaking
of that particular circumstance, that it's batter to let a few
of these people maybe not go to prison and have a stiffen fine
or soma other type of penalty *—
Q

Wall, maybe he’d go to prison.

But in my

brother Marshall’s hypothetical case, where you had an offence
whore never, in the particular jurisdiction, had anybody been
sentenced to prison for the commission of this offense, and
so at. the outset of the trial it could be fairly confidently
assumed that this defendant was not going to prison.

And then,

*— and then it developed, during the course of the trial, that
for on® reason or another this was a singularly, egregiously. ..
outrageous example of this particular violation.

19

And, for good and sufficient reasons, after the
defendant was convicted, he was sentenced to prison, and for the
first time in the history of that jurisdiction.

Then, would it

toe your position that the convicted defendant could then appeal
and have a new trial, this time with a lawyer.
MR. SHEAs

¥es, sir.

In addition to tbs fact that we’re offering this
test, 1 also point out, as the Chief Justice has, that the
test is else one recommended by the ABA minimum standards.
We suggest that there is another possibility for a test, and
that would be a stricter application, a looking directly at the
statute, and if the statute has a possibility at all of
imprisonment, that then counsel must be provided if the person
is indigent.
If that v;era the rule to be handed down by this case,
by this Court, I would hope that the American jurisprudence
aystem would taka heed of 'President Mixon's latest comments on
legal reform, and that we proceed to eliminate from the
possibility of incarceration many of these minor crimes where*
there is no victim.
I think that I will cave the remainder of my time fer
rebuttal to the State.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
Mr. Georgiaff.

Very well, Mr. Shea.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP GEORGE R, GE0R3XEFF, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF CF THE RESPONDENT
24R, 3E0RGXSFF;

Mr. Chief' Justice, and may At please

the Courts
I guess this is as fitting an occasion as any to
taka off on the down side of Gideon, since Florida opened the
door for Gideon itself.

1 suspect Florida is the proper State

to decide whether Gideon should be extended downward.
Hopefully, the result won't be the same as it was in
Gideon, although I think it was a sound one.
I think I'd like to put something to rest before we
get too far into it.

Felonies and misdemeanors, as defined in

Florida, as of todays
Felonies are those offenses punishable by imprison­
ment in the State penitentiary.

How, it doesn't mean that they

must bo so incarcerated, nines we do have provisions for
alternative confinement in county jails for offenses five years
or loss in term.
Nov;, misdemeanors are all offenses otherwise punish­
able by confinement in the county jail.
Everything else is something less than a crime in
Florida.

It's neither a misdemeanor nor a felony.

Municipal

violation, if you taka up the situation in Dade County you
have metro violations, which don't fit either bracket.
Q

What kind of violation?

Metro?

21
MR. GEORGIEFFs
Government.

Metro.

It’s a combination of those cities which decided

to go together with the county.
Q

Yes

„

MR. GEORGIEFF;

Now, there are some 23, as I under­

stand , which are not a part of it, and they remain isolated
municipalities with their own unit of government.
Q

So a municipal offense or a metro violation is

something less, even, than a misdemeanor?
MR. GEORGIEFFi

Oh. yes.

Thera are — as to metro,

they are sui generis in terras of Miami being the leader —Dade County being the leader in that situation.
Q

The city and county, in a consolidated government

MR. GEORGIEFF; But they are all less than misdemeanors
Q

And in terms of punishment, what’s the maximum

that they carry?

MR, GEORGIEFF;

I would hazard on th© outside now —

perhaps Mr. Shea can correct me? but I would hazard that it
cannot exceed 90 days.

And that’s true with all municipal

I’ve not known of any that go in excess of that.

Now, conceivably, you can have some of them back to

bads, which would result in a longer period of confinement,
but the maximum, op the outside, is 90 days.

on that order.
Q

city jail, city compounds, something

Now, I don't have a title for all the places —
But not in the county jail for some?

ME* GEORGIEFF:

No, sir.

Now, as a matter of fact, there are many times in the
rural counties where they don't have county compounds.

They

often, by arrangement, have them served in the on® city that
may exist.

For instance, in a place like Liberty County, which

has only 2800 people in it, they do not have a compound —

they interchange their facility*
But if we're going to deal with labels, X wanted \ to
straighten that much out first.
But we intend to throw labels out the window, because
they really don't mean anything at all.

You said so in Gault,

and that's a fact.
Under the Criminal Justice Act, it is broken by
Congress at six months on the petty offense doctrine.

Now,

after the decision in Gideon, and X think «Mr. Justice Stewart,
C*.«fc^*tU».VMV Is USUM.

after the several times when you suggested that perhaps the
matter of misdemeanors ought to be treated, and had not been,
the. Supremo Court of Florida decided in Fish va, State that if
^cra

had meant that Gideon should apply across the board as to

f.v/v-.ich includes both misdemeanors and felonies, that
you would have sale! so.
And therefore they held that counsel was not an

23
organic right in misdemeanor situations# no matter what.
New( on another occasion before you, I advised you
that indeed there were seme misdemeanors in Florida, though
there have been no prosecutions under them, that carried a
maximum penalty# would you believe, of eight years,

And in

which case, I think by an inquiry from Mr, Justice Brennan, I
replied that if you had a. situation like that, it would be
absurd to suggest that you don’t appoint counsel for him, because
of ih© term of confinement,

\
)

Now, ss of January 'the 1st of 1572, all that will be
wiped out by the passage cf 71-136, which is a general revisor
bill? and that’s known as the Florida Session Law Service, it’s
a post binder, covered in pages 381 to 711, or some 380-odd
pages of a general revision of the Criminal Code of Florida,
They break down felonies into four degreess capital,
and three degrees of felonies»
They break misdemeanors down to two degrees.
misdemeanors are broken down very simply.

And

In terms of time,

and/or money fines, for a misdemeanor of the first degree by a
definite term of imprisonment in the county jail, not exceeding
one year.
We understand that under the decisions of the Fifth
Circuit, in Harvey and the others, and, indeed, under Judge
Mahrtens

decision in Brinson, where he breaks it at six months

based v. v, the Criminal Justice Act, and expecting a similar

24
treatment as to Federal and State prisoners, it's certainly
everybody in Florida, as of January the 1st, who is under a
misdemeanor in the first degree, is going to get counsel as a
matter of course.
>

Now, for a misdemeanor of a second degree, by a
definite term of imprisonment in the county jail, not exceeding
60 days.
Not, there is also & fine provision which sets the
fine at $500, but obviously after you reached the '-decision that
yc;s did in Tate, that's meaningless? since, if he's indigent
and can't pay the fine, ho can't be made to serve more than 60
days, no matter hot-? you cut it.
Sc we are now in tho posture of going down 30 days
below what the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has said was
their acceptable petty offense line.

If it was all misdemeanors

before, if it was reduced to six months by the Criminal Justice
Act, and by the State of Florida Supreme Court in Argorsinger,
and even if the Federal District Court in Jacksonville under
Wopley ■»- and, by the way, the only reason they are not advising
everybody as to everything is they are awaiting the outcome of
your decision here in this case today.

Mew, we. s;ay the breaking point with the Fifth Circuit
was cat at SO days.

We set 'it ourselves by the Florida Supreme

Court, relying on Judge Hehrtens* decision in Brinson, at six
months #

which coincides with what you said in Baldwin as to

juries, and with the Criminal Justice Act as to petty offensas.
Now, the question becomes*

Is it awesome to the man

who faces some kind of imprisonment: no matter what?

Well,

somewhere you must break the line.
There was no command at the time that Argersinger was
argued there-», except that that is urged here.
Now, X don’t know how far we can break it.

All 1

do know is, as of January the let, there are only going to he a
handful of people who are ever processed on misdemeanor charges,
who won’t, based upon the imprisonment possible, be provided
counsel.
0

Well, let’s SQsf Mr. Georgiafff X gather your

provision doesn’t reach, though, the metro offenses or the
other typo, offenses?
."1R. 0f:0‘;H’IhL*'Fs
Q

Ho, Your Honor, it does not.

Just State offenses.

MR. G30RGXEFP* That’s right.
?

Now, if you recall, under Waller, of course
:■ itropolitan communities and/or cities, or whatever you may call
them, exist at the sufferance of the Legislature.

Mo laws

• that they adopt are criminal in nature, and they adopt whatever
they like, either by individual charter provisions or that they
adopt the violations of State law as city ordinances.

But they

must set independent punishment.
In other words, the revisors bill does not reach them

as
in any degree.

I tell you as a matter of pure fact, though,

it isn’t in the record here, that no city has violations, to
my knowledge, .that have ever come to my attention, that.
eKcv.d 90 d-ryc for a violation of what would be a criminal law
had it been processed in the State or by the county*
Sr. in the last analysis we’re told that you allow
'i.

■

power to coma into court with a lawyer in situations, of their
own hiring, so why shouldn’t you do it here no matter what the
penalty is?
«fell, if you do, and if we use the statistics that
they’ve given us on the New York report of the 1,300,000, with
only 40 processed to the degree where they were put in confine­
ment, if anything ever sounded like de minimis to me, that
certainly does.
Now, if it is the awesome prospect that they tell us
■‘•hat it is? how coma so few over wound up in jail as a result
of it?
•'

think Mr, Justice Marshall’s question' about *

what do you do when somebody winds up on the short end of a
theretofore vacant threat, wall, obviously, as you posed, Mr*
Justice Stewart, is*

If you wind up with a situation like that,

that’s easily correctable.

We grant them a new trial»

if wh&t

happened to him so far outstripped what anybody expected,
certainly they’re going to grant him a new trial.
isn’t any question about it.

Now, there

Nov?, X don’t know how often that's going to oocur, if
at all.

They are now tinder —• the Legislature is in special

session this very day, and they will meet in general session in
February to take up,- of all things, another revisors bill,
which, it is hoped, will do away with most if not all of the
victimless crimes.
New, that won't do away with the DWI’s or anything
like that, assuming anybody is injured or there's a substantial
amount of property damage.
Q

What’s BWX?

HR. GEOKGIEFFi

Driving while intoxicated* or under

the influence.

Q

Yes.

MR. GEORGIEFFs Now, many of the minor violations,
such as drunkenness, loitering, and 1 don’t know what-all, will
if this goes through, bo wiped out.

Now, what that will do

statistically to the problem posed, as suggested by petitioners

X do not know.

But if we do away with victimless crimes, .fre’re

going to do away, for the most part, with what was the object

of your concern in Tate and other cases similar to it.
«MbtiKtenjuBK*»

X submit that it's not anywhere near the problem
suggested.

I submit that the Congress didn’t think that it was

I submit that not even the Fifth Circuit thinks that it should
be extended below the 90-day breaking line that they adopted.
But even if it is, Florida has broken it at SO days,

28
as of January the 1st, 19?2j and, for all the world, nothing
I hava heard h©i*e today gives me any res on to suspect that what
was done with regard to Mr, Argersinger in the Florida Supreme
Court should even bo modified by any decision that you render
here today.
I know that somebody says by one day he lost the
benefit of counsel.

Well, wherever you draw the line, assuming

that it's not all the way down in the basement, somebody is
going to lose by one day.

Presumably, if you sot the limit at

58 days, surely an artful legislator would say. Well, let's
make it 37.

And it would be a. never-ending battle.

So X don’t know that one day makes the difference»
X know that the dogtrine of petty offense has to mean something»
Certainly the Congress was not stupid when they adopted it,
nor was the Fifth Circuit stupid when they said that wo think
90 days is a good place at which to break it,
X think Judge Mehrtens was amply justified in breaking
/

it at the six months suggested by the Criminal Justice Act of
'34»

Since it does coincide, and since that is what th©

Florida Supreme Court relied on, and there's really no
predicate for deciding that there ought to be a departure,
below the six-month petty offense rule, and, in the last analysis,
since Florida is not going to be imposing these awesome burdens
at any time after January 1, I think the action of the Supreme:
Court of Florida should be affirmed in this case.

29

Thank you*
Q

Hw about the rules for the — approved by this

Court for the magistrates?

Has that got anything to do with

it, do you think?
MR. GEORGiEPP:

Well, X don’t know that an individual

stands in any different posture when ha's before a U« S, Magis­
trate than he does when he’s before a county judge, let’s say;
or, for the matter of that, wherever ho may fee, where a
confinement ic going to run no more than six months*
Xf it’s satisfactory for an individual before a O'. S«
Magistrate? 1 should imagine that it’s meaningless to an
individual anywhere else to tell him:

Don’t worry about the

ropa burning, it’s made out of linen instead of hemp.
That’s just another reason, X think, Mr, Justice
Stewart, why to make a false distinction, simply because this
had its genesis in a State proceeding would be untoward,
There’s no reason to tell an individual being processed in a
criminal system that it's different in one area, and he’s
entitled to counsel there, than it is in another where he’s
not, simply by rules adopted either by this Court or by the
counties,

1 think the posture is the same.

A jail cell is a jail cell is a jail cell*
Now, X don’t stand ready, willing, or able to tell you
that an individual ought to like it for one day.
of them do

I’m sure none

But if we * re going to live in a world with people

30
who served, and if there are going to be enough of them to go
around, then X think an intelligent break is made at ths six»*
month petty offense situation, and, hopefully, by the time
we're finished, you will agree with that and affirm the action
below.
X hope that's answered your question, sir.
Q

Yea.

MR. GEORGXEFF :

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Georgieff.

Mr. Shea, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. MICHAEL SHEA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHEA:

I find it very difficult to understand

how wa can pick anything less than one day.
arbitrarily say one day, 30 days, or 60 days?

How can we
To the man that's

sitting in jail, that decision is completely arbitrary.
Now, I also would offer that there's no logical
reason for picking 60 days or 90 days or six months.
As to some of the points Mr. Georgief£ raised, I
believe there’s now a Florida statute that was recently passed
in the last session that makes county ordinances -the same as
misdemeanors, and that’s Session Law 70-453, subsection something"
or-'Other „

In all misdemeanor casas, only those where it's a practical
possibility that th© person may receive some incarceration.
X think that the position of the Fifth Circuit was a
bit misleading, as far as the State presented.
the Fifth Circuit has a 90-day rule.
quite the case.

They said that

X don't think that's

The Fifth Circuit has ruled on a case in which

they said a person charged with an offense that received 90 days
should be given the right to counsel, but I think they left
the bottom end of that open.
And they have only ruled in the other cases on similar
special circumstances.
In conclusion, 'X think that it's evident that our
position and that of the States is not that far apart*

They

haven't com® before you this morning and suggested that a mail
not be given the right to counsel on misdemeanors.

They have

only suggested that it should be either six months, and now
they've come with another possibility of SO days*
We fool that the only real test is to go completely
as the Constitution says.

A person who is in the position of a

possible incarceration must be given the right to counsel, and
if lie is not given that right, he cannot be sent to prison.
It's that simple.

That's our test.

Mr, Shea, on January 27th..of this year, this

Court, as you know, promulgated rulfs of procedure for the trial
of minor offenses before magistrates, which, by subsequent
inaction of the Congress of the United States, X understand,

have now become effective rules.

And you are familiar with

those- rules
MR. SHEA:
Q

Yes, sir, l am.

in your brief.
MR. SHEA:

Yes, sir.

What bearing, if any, do you think they have on

your argument, on your position in this case?

1 think they’re unconstitutional, as they

Why?

MR, SHEA:

Because they are in violation of the

Q

Why?

MR, SHEA:

Because the Constitution says that a person

shall have the right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions.

Q

But your second answer was that these rules

don't say that persons shall not have the right to counsel.
MR. SEEAs Well, 2 think that the only way that it can
be construed that they do say that is through that negative
predicate, end 2 would suggest that that's a poor way of putting

this question to bad.
1 don't read it that way myself.

You don't read it which way?
