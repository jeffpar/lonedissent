MR. CHIB*

/usTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

against Allegheny-Luollum Steel Corporation.
Mr. Huntington, you may proceed whenever yon * re

ORAM ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This case is here on direct appeal from a threejudge district court sitting in the Western District of
Pennsylvania.

The question presented is whether the

District Court erred in enjoining the enforcement of two
service rules adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission
to govern the movement of freight cars.

The rules were

promulgated under Section 1{14}(a) of the Interstate
Commerce Act which authorizes the commission to establish
reasonable rules with respect to car service.
For mere than a century railroads have freely
interchanged freight cars- so that freight could be shipped
from point of origin to point of destination on a single car.
To govern the return of freight cars to their owners,
railroads vs early as 1902 adopted a code of car service rules..
Some of the

u3as

now published by appellee, the American

4
Association of Railrceds, or AAR, and virtually all railroads
in the country have agreed to abide by them.

The railroads*

record of compliance with the AAR car service rules, however,
has been poor, particularly during times of general freight
oar shortage.

The commission in this case determined that

a number of the AAR rules should be enforced and thus
adopted them verbatim as commission rules.
The two rules here under attack, Rules 1 and 2,
generally require that unloaded freight cars be returned
rii cher empty or loaded in the direction of the railroads
owning the cars.
Freight car shortages have been a serious and
recurring problem throughout most of this century.

In the

I940*s, for example, the commission concluded after a
general investigation that railroads as a group had failed
to provide adequate freight car service.

The commission at

that time did not adopt mandatory rules in the hope that the
railroads would take steps to solve the problem themselves.
By the 1960’s, however, it became apparent that the
problem was getting worse.

Clearly voluntary action by the

ra‘lroads had not provided the solution.

To meet the crisis,

the -commission acted on a number of related fronts.

These

actions included adjusting the per diem charges that one
railroad paid for the use of another's cars, enforcing the
requirement cb

--xcars be free of debris when unloaded,

5
and the sponsoring of remedial legislation.
The ocmmission's attempt to add an incentive
element in the per diam charges is a subject of another
appeal pending before this Court.

That’s the Florida

East Coast Railway appeal, No. 70-279.
The instant case was initiated by the commission
to investigate all aspects of freight car shortages and to
consider the prescription of mandatory car service rules.
The evidence ir this case shows that the total number of
freight ears owned by railroads declined from 1955 to 1964
by more than 12 percent, while the individual capacity,
the average capacity of individual cars, increased during
that period; the aggregate capacity of all cars also
declined by five percent.

The decline was sharpest#more

than 22 percent, with respect to plain boxcars.

Plain

boxcars, which make up about one-third of the number of
freight cars in the country, are the workhorse of the car
\

£leet.
Many railroads and practically all the shippers
participating in these proceedings acknowledge the existence
of a current national freight car shortage.

In fact,

appellee at the National Industrial Traffic League testified—
a witness testified—that the number of freight oars in the
long run should he doubled in order to meet the needs of the
shippers.'

6
To combat the shortage and dislocation of freig!
cars,

the ccaovissio.-.*' 3, Bureau of Operations proposed that

certain car service rules be made mandatory»

Appellees

have attempted to paint a picture of virtually uniform
opposition to the imposition of mandatory rules.

In fact,

however, same railroads and more than some shippers
testified, that enforceable car service rules were needed,
The strongest opposition to mandatory enforcement
of car service rules came from the steel industry.

Witnesses

for the industry testified that steel companies have special
problems with respect to the loading of freight cars.

The

companies introduced studies to show that full compliance
with the car service Rules 1 and 2 would be impractical.
The same studies, however, which are cited at page 44 of
the steel appellee's brief, these same studies indicated
■that a vast improvement in the percentage of compliance
with the car service rules was possible, albeit at. some cost
to the steel companies.
On completion of the hearings, the Examiner filed
a report recommending discontinuance of the proceedings on
the grounds that no shortage of freight cars existed and
also on the ground that prescription of the car service
rules for mandatory observance was unwarranted.
Q

Mr. Huntington, you told us eas:Her that the

o-oaimssion moved on several related fronts in attacking this

7
basic problemf one adjusting the par diem and another
requiring that -die debris be removed from cars before they
era returned»
Congress®

You mentioned sponsoring legislation in

No new legislation relating to this problem has

been enacted, has it?
MR. HUNTINGDON:
Q

No, it hasn’t; no.

There have been hearings.

MR. HUNTINGTON:

There have been hearings but

nothing--no final action has taken place.

In rejecting the Examiner’s conclusions, the
commission fully analysed the data on shortages and found
that there is in fact a freight car shortage.
commission also found that an alarmingly

The

low percentage

of freight cars are on the lines of their owners at any
given time.

The commission concluded that because freight

car owners have such little use of their cars, they are less
able to meet ths particular needs of their shippers and they
have little incentive to spend money purchasing new cars
or spend money to maintain their existing cars to high
standards.
The commission therefore prescribed AR Rules 1 and

2t among others, for mandatory observance, stating that the
primary objective was to increase the availability of cars
tc their owners.

In that way, railroads could better

provide for their Shippers, and those railroads with

8

deficient car supplies would be identified and compelled to
purchase new cars»
Rules 1 and 2 as adopted, by the commission had a
built-in exception provision; on petitions for reconsideration
-he commission adopted Rule .19 which established an
additional procedure for obtaining exceptions.
To determine the validity of the commission's
action here, the starting point is,, of course, the statute
Section 1(14)(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.

We have

traced the legislative history of that section in our brief,
and I will not go into that here.

The one point I would

like to make, C would like to meet the appellee's contention
that the statute was designed solely to deal with
distribution problems of freight cars as opposed to problems
of an inadequate number of freight cars.

I'd like to just

make three points with respect to that.
First., a look at the original Each Act, of which
Section 1(14)(a) was a part, shows that the act was indeed
concerned with, the supply of freight cars.

The part of the

original act conferring emergency powers on the commission
conditioned the exercise of such powers on a determination
that, an emergency exists in respect of "the supply of use"
cars.

When later an additional provision, which is new

Section 1(14) (a) was added to confer powers upon the
commission in non-emergency situations, the Congress simply

9
did not put in that prerequisite requirement for a finding
that them was an emergency.

So, the supply or use languages

was simply left, out of that provision»
The second point l*d like to make is that the
House report on the Each Act, which is cited at page 2,1 of

•

our brief, clearly reflects a concern with the under™
equipment of the roads or the lack of sufficient cars.
Finally, any doubt as to the- coverage of the
original Esch Act was removed in 1920.

The original act

heid defined car service to include the movement, distribu­
tion, exchange, interchange, and return of cars.

In 132G

the definition was amended to include the huge control,
supply,movement, et cetera, of cars.
The primary thrust of appellee’s attack on. the
commissionfa adoption of Rules 1 and 2 is that the commission
failed to make certain findings and failed to give proper
attention to ti2 adverse effects of its order.

It is

claimed, for example, that the commission should have made
a finding with respect to the shortages on high ownership
lines.

I think it would be useful here to define what I

mean by high ownership lines.
High ownership roads, as I shall use the terra, tt.ro
those which come relatively close to meeting their
responsibilities to provide a fair share of the nation * s
freight ce.zs „

As thus defined, a high ownership railroad

10

could be a small carrier, owning in absolute terras a small
nuiaber of cars, provided the carrier was meeting its general
responsibility to provide a fair share of the nation’s supply
of cars»
’ The District Court faulted the commission for
failing to find that freight car shortages wore more acute
on high ownership railroads than on low ownership railroads.
Appellees' appear to assert more generally that the
commission's order is defective, since the commission did
not find that high ownership railroads have a need for the
return of their

oars.

In our view, there are several

reasons why neither of these findings was necessary.
First, as I have said, the purpose of the
commission’s order was to increase the overall supply of
freight cars..

Clearly, some railroads would have to

purchase additional cars.

While the order in general is

expected to provide an incentive for all railroads to
acquire cars» it in particular puts the onus on the low
ownership 2Lne where it rightly should be.
Second, even if there were no shortages on high
ownership lines, enforcement of the rules would not
necessarily create an excess or surplus of cars on those
lines.

While high ownership railroads will have fche.tr own

tars .returned to them more expeditiously, they in turn, of
course, will here to return foreign cars bn their systems to

11
the owning roads.
Finally, in the event that a surplus should
develop on a particular railroad, the road could make the
surplus cars available to other railroads who had a need
for those cars.

This could be done under the exception

provision provided in Rules i and 2.

And, moreover, the

commission always has the emergency authority under
Section 115 of the act to order the cars shipped-“-to order
any surplus cars shipped to an area where they are needed,
Appellees also assert that the commission should
have made

a finding with respect to the financial capacity

of low ownership railroads to acquire new equipment.

But

the commission*s order does not direct any particular
railroad to purchase equipment.

What it does do is to

provide an incentive for railroads to purchase equipment.
There are a variety of methods of financing new equipment,
many of which do not require substantial initial capital
outlays.
A witness for the Southern Pacific, for example,
testified that that company had acquired a leasing
corporation and was prepared to lease freight cars to
railroads who were unable to purchase them outright.

And

a special provision in the Bankruptcy Act which we have cited
.it page 30 c-f our brief makes it possible for railroads
undergoing reorganisation to purchase new equipment.

The

12
Penn Central, for example, has been able to acquire new
equipment while it has been in reorganization.

And one of

the railroads that supported the adoption of mandatory
rules here, the then New York, Hew Haven, and Hartford,
was itself in reorganisation at the time of the proceedings.
In general, the argument that specific findings
should have been made with respect to shortages and financia
capacity must be put in the context of what was and what was
not possible in these proceedings.

The commission squarely

acknowledged that it was unable to make findings of
shortages on particular carriers.

Obviously, therefore, it

could not make findings with respect to the financial
ability of low ownership roads to acquire equipment.

Yet

the commission could find and did find that the railroads
at a whole did not own an adequate number of freight cars.
To say that in spite of this finding the
commission was powerless to act until every aspect of the
shortage was fully analyzed and characterised, categorized,
would be to restrict unduly the commission’s authority under
Section 1(14)(a) to meet shortages by adopting reasonable
car service rules.
Finally, appellees fault the commission for
failing to find the rules, would in fact increase the supply
of freight cars.

But no one can predict exactly what the

jutccsvic of Hi-undatory enforcement of these rules will be.

13
The commission's conclusion that its order should have the
■ increasing supply, we submit, was entirely
reasonable and fully justified by its reasoning, which is
disclosed by its opinion.
And, finally, the commission recognizing that, in
the light of experience, modification to the rules might be
necessary, specifically held the proceeding open sc that as
experience developed they could take steps to modify the
rules.
Apart from the alleged absence of required
findings, appellees contend that the enforcement of Buies
1 and 2 will impose undue hardship on shippers and railroads
alike, and will completely alter the traditional methods' of
moving traffic*
To begin with, particularly this latter charge’,
it rings a little bit hollow, since it is in fact the
railroads’own rules which are being enforced here.

But mors

to the point, enforcement of the rules will not, as is
suggested, result in the abolishment of a national pool of
freight cars.

The rules do not prohibit the loading of

foreign freight cars.

They simply prescribe the circumstances

under which it can be done.

Railroads, both large and

small, will continue to use a mixture of foreign and home
cars to meat the needs of their shippers.
With respect to the undue hardship argument,

ariccyons recognises that one hundred percent compliance
'under the Chi; rules will not be possible.

Indeed, a

commission witness testified that it was impossible to
write any set of car service rules .which could be complied
with a hundred percent of the time.
The exception provisions adopted by the commission ,
we submit, provide the necessary relief which will allow
these rules to be workable.

The first provision is contained

in Note B to Rules 1 and 2.

That's at page 34 of our

brief.

That provision permits the railroads involved to

negotiate exceptions to the rules where inequities arise.
These negotiations will be subject only to the
concurrence of the car service division of the AAR.
approval of the commission will not be necessary,,

Prior
It is

expected that the AAR will keep the commission informed as
to what sort of exceptions it was approving.

But the

initial responsibility would be on the railroads themselves
to negotiate exceptions and then to obtain the approval of
the AAR.
There is no requirement that requests to the AAR
be- in writing, and none is sought to be imposed by the
commission.

Her will a separata exception be required with

reopact to each individual freight car that is supposed to
be. loaded not in compliance with the rules.

Negotiated

• •• gtiev may, in fact, involve many freight cars, so that

15
appellees ■

asservior, that there will be a flood of requests

ror exceptions™ ”*1' think they predicted something like
40,000 a month--we submit is a very gross exaggeration
indeed.
Where an agreement between the railroads cannot
ae attained or where the AAR car service rule does not
©adorse such an agreement, then Rule 19 comes into play.
tU'ila 19. which was adopted by the commission on reconsidera­
tion, grants very broad—-is a very broad grant of authority.
I’d just like to quote from that rule.

Under that rule

the Bureau of Operations is given the authority fee grant
exceptions

for the purpose of further improving car supply

utilisation, increasing availability of cars to their
owners, improving the efficiency of railroad operations or
alleviating inequities or hardships."
The commission's order promulgating Rule 19 goes
even further and specifically authorizes the Bureau of
Operations uo modify the car service rules for the purposes
specified in Rule 19',
0

now much paperwork would one have to go through

to get an exception under Rule 19?
MR. HUNTINGTON:
has been worked out.

Under Rule 19, I’m not sure this

I would imagine that for broad

arcap'cxcns F say, which might cover the operations of an
entire plant, the submission would have to be in writing.

For more casual exceptions covering only a matter
c

a lew cares, 1 think it might be done simply by telephone.
Another attack made by appellees is that the

commission has not provided the Court with a basis for
determining whether its adoption of car service Rules 1 and
2 is consistent with the national transportation policy
adopted by Congress.

Under that policy the commission must

administer -the Interstate Commarce Act to promote an adequate,
economical, and efficient national transportation system.
But clearly the commission's action here comports with that
policy, since the whole purpose of the adoption of the rules
is to promote adequate freight car service, and it is this
adequate freight car service which the railroads have thus
far been unable to provide by themselves.
I would like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal.
Ml;. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Huntington.

Very well,

Mr. Truitt?

ORA?. ARGUMENT OP MAX 0. TRUITT, JR. , ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLEES
MR. TRUITTs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
X will present the argument on behalf of the
shippers in thxs case, and Mr. Moloney will argue on behalf
of the railroad;?.

We hove agreed to divide cur time' evenly.

1?

On behalf of the shippers, let me say that we
are willing to accept the finding of the conclusion that
there is a freight car shortage.

X don’t believe it is fair

to characterize it,, as Mr. Huntington did, as a chronic
national shortage, and I don’t believe the record will
support that.

But we are not willing to accept the

commission’s proposed remedy, for two reasons.
First, is that when you take car service Rules 1
and 2 and make them mandatory, they are not, we contend,
reasonable ear service rules as required under Section
If 14} of the Interstate Commerce Act, because they will
<!

work enormous injury, both to shippers and carriers and
without, we contend, any offsetting benefit and because in
fact they cannot be complied with because the exceptions
provisions to which Mr. Huntington has referred are wholly
inadequate.
Secondly, we contend that the imposition of these
rules for mandatory observance as a method of solving the
freight car shortage problem is a method of causing an
increase in the number of cars that exist simply is not
rational.

The thrust of car service Rules 1 and 2 is this.

When a railroad unloads a car that it does not own, car
service Rules 1 and 2 oblige it to return that car to its
owner.

The purpose of re turning the car to the owner, as

the commission concedes, is to make the car available to its

18
owner,

And the. obligation to return takes precedence over

the needs of any shipper that may be located on the lines
where the car was unloaded to have their freight moved.
As ar. obvious correlative of returning cars to
ownera, it is perfectly.clear that some railroads are
deprived, of the- use of those cars and some shippers do not
get their freight moved by the mere accident of being located
on a line which does not happen to have a car of proper
ownership in which- its freight can foe loaded,
At the present time the railroads have access
either by owning cars or by renting them to a national car
pool, and access to this pool enables car car pooler reads—
that is, those that don't own enough—serve their shippers
by using the cars that belong to other roads.

This has been

worked out as a result really of a national policy in Savor
of moving freight as opposed to returning cats merely to
their owners6
For example, if, for instance, the Southern Pacific
leads up all of its own boxcars and sends them off in the
direction' of the East, it does not have to stop sending
traffic and wait until it gets the cars back.
•the cars of ether railroads.

It can send

It can load them and send them

wherever the freight needs to go,
The .commissiones order changes all of that

and,

as l say, creates an absolute claim by an owner on the use

19
of his case and it gives his shippers a preferential access
to rail transportation.
Oar’ first argument is that the commissiones order
cannot be sustained as an order which prescribes

reasonable

car service rules, because the rules are not reasonable
when they are made obligatory.

As the record reflects, the

absolute compliance with the rules would cause enormous
injury to shippers.

The injury to the shippers—and I must

say that the steel industry was only one of several which
Les vigorously—is detailed throughout the
record.

The gypsum industry opposed, the grocery industry

opposed, the chemical industry opposed, every' industry which
brokers its products in transit opposed because obviously
if you are located on the West Coast and you’re sending a
load. East

and you’re going to sell it on the way, and you

den*t know until it gets midway across country whether it's
going to end up in Portland, Maine or Miami, Florida, you
oan’-t very rail load that car in compliance with the rules.
The. steel industry particularly detailed an
absolute inability to forecast the needs at the loading
deck in order to order cars of appropriate ownership, even.
if the roads which serve the plans happen to have proper
ownership cars on hand.
Thu Hearing Examiner found, for example, that at
the Youngstown plant at Campbell, Ohio the obligation to

20

ocaroiy with the rules would create a situation which couldn't
;)'v dealt with,

The steel company simply did not have the

room and the switching facilities to load cars properly.
And it was this kind of evidence and that kind of finding
which the commission I think rather cavalierly characterized
as some extra switching -and short delays.
■Other shippers, as I say, also opposed the
observance of these rules on a mandatory basis vigorously.
The commission indeed acknowledged or the Hearing Examiner
acknowledged that the shippers presented a solid opposition
to the rules.
Against that solid opposition and against the
evidence that mandatory observance would injure shippers,
one would suppose that the ^commission would have found that
would be some o:
service, but there isn't.

ting benefits in terms of car
The best the commission can.do

is to say that return of cars to the owners will improve
utilisation by making them available to the owners.

And it

is here, X thin’:, that we and the government so fundamentally
disagree.

If making cars available to the owner is really

going to improve car service, then it must be because there
is freight on the owners’ lines to be shipped or there's more
freight on the owners' lines to be shipped or that whatever
freight there is there is in greater need of shipment than
the freight which is located where the car is unloaded.

But

21
there is no such evidence anywhere in the record.

And it

is for that reason, of course, there is no finding.
Moreover, in the 194? proceeding to which
Mr. Huntington referred, entitled Car Service, Freight Cars
alluded to on page 20 of our brief, the commission found
that in times cf car shortage maximum utilisation of the
.existing freight car fleet required ignoring car service
Rules X and 2 and instead of. taking an unloaded empty and
sending it back to the owner-—-to or toward the owner*—if
there wasn’t a load ready to go with it, that the maximum
utilisation of the freight car fleet was achieved by taking
•chat empty and sending it to the nearest freight and moving
■that.

In this proceeding the commission has offered

absolutely no justification whatsoever for departing from
that precedent.

Accordingly, we urge as our first point

that the rules cannot be sustained as reasonable car
service rules.
Q

A second—
These Rules 1 and 2 go back how far?

MR. TRUITT:

I believe the present per diem in

car service agreement, Mr. Justice Stewart, goes back to
about 1920e
that long.

The rules have existed in this form for about
1 don * t mean in this particular form of words

but in this set of-Q

Instructions *

MR. TRUITT;

It isn't a set of instructions really.

2*%.6

It's a statement of preference.

If the Southern Pacific

Railroad has a load of freight that is bound for Maine and
it has one of its own cars and it has :a car of a northwestern
road and it has a Boston and Maine car, the rules state a
preference for leading the B a M and sending that car back
towards its home road.

But it has never been obligatory

and it has never been enforced so that freight is left
unshipped.

So that if the only cars the southern railroad

has are the Boston and Maine cars and it has a load going to
Seattle, Washington and it doesn't have a Seattle, Washington
car, then it cai use a B & M car and send the freight up
there.

Under the commission's proposal, of course, it won't

be able to do that.
Q

That would be a violation.

Under the wording—or am X wrong'—under the

wording of Rules 1 and 2 as adopted voluntarily by the
association and its members, the Southern Pacific or whatever
your road was, wouldn’t have been free to do that.
MR. TRUITT:

The rules, although they may read on

their face---Q

In fact, the common law of the--

MR. TRUITT:

In fact, the common law of the railroad

industry is such that they have been always allowed to make
coraxaonsense transportation officer good judgments about
whether v. violation of the rules is going to move the freight.
br;.d, .in fact, in 1967 when the current version of the A&R

23
iuias was adopted, it was a good faith—a standard of good
faith diligence was written into the rules expressly.

So

that it has never been an absolute prohibition or an
absolute injunction about how cars should—
Q

Even though its literal words might imply

otherwise?
Mil. TRUITT;

0

Yes,, sir, that is correct.

But these rules voluntarily agreed upon have

not prevented boxcars and freight cars from sitting empty
in one part of the country for long periods when they are
desperately needed in other parts; isn’t that true?
MR. TRUITT;

I believe there is evidence of that

in the record,, Mr. Chief Justice, yes.
Q

It found that?

ME. TRUITTS

1 believe it did find that.

The

question, though, is whether the rules—the argument to which
I am about to come is whether the imposition of these rules
for mandatory observance is a rational way of expanding the
else of the freight car fleet, for that after all is what
the commission is really about.

That's what it was really

trying to do.
The theory of the commission's order is simply to
make the poor poorer.

If you take railroads that don’t own.

enough cars and you don't let them rent, cars, then in theory
they’ll have to go out and buy cars, and that is, I believe,

24
the acknowledged purpose of the rules.

But we contend that

there are simply no findings to support such a proposal.
In the first place, there are no findings of which shippers
will he deprived of cars or of what type and volume of
freight would be delayed or transferred to competitive modes
el transportation.

Nor is there any explanation in the

commission’s report of how depriving some unidentified
shippers of their access to railroads and thus depriving
those railroads of the

revenues they could earn if they

could use the cars to move freight is consistent with the
goals of the national transportation policy which are to
* foster adequate, economical, and efficient service.
Although the commission is obliged under the
national transportation policy to administer the act so as
to foster sound economic conditions among carriers, to
prevent destructive competitive practices and to prohibit
unjust discrimination, there ara no findings in the
commission’s report concerning the impact of its order on
any aspect of competition.
The Hearing Examiner noted that evidence existed
in the'record that the rules would have an effect on
competition.

And, indeed, he chastised soma of the

commission witnesses for failing to develop v;hat precisely
the impact, would be.

But the commission’s report here is

absolutely- silent and it gives absolutely no consideration

25
to what, effect these rules will have on shippers, on
carriers, rai1 carriers, or indeed on one class of carrier
as opposed to another class of carrier.

So, we don’t have

any idea what the commission’s rule will really do.
The final and I think most glaring omission is the
failure to find that any road will be financially able to
purchase cars.

Since the objective of the commission’s

proceeding is to cause railroads to increase their
ownership, it seems only reasonable that the commission
should determine that they're able to do that.

It didn't.

The reason it didn’t, I suppose, is perfectly clear.

As we

mention in our brief. Commissioner Stafford of the commission,
when he was testifying on one. of the bills you asked about,
Mr. Justice Stewart, just last year, testified before the
Senate Commerce Committee that the railroads simply didn’t
have economic capability of solving the freight car
shortage.

That 1 think is why there is no evidence about

which roads could buy.

That is why there is no finding

that the roads deprived would in fact be able to buy.
Indeed, when you consider the whole statute, you
will discover that there is one section, which is Paragraph 21
of Section 1, which authorizes the commission to acquire
railroads, to acquire facilities, but it doesn’t permit the
commission to do that unless the commission finds that the
roads which will be ordered to acquire facilities can in fact

26
do so without impairing their financial ability of serving
the public and discharging ths.tr common carriage obligations

Mr. Chief Justice, one word in response to the
question you asked me specifically.
the commission

The evidence to which

adverted, boxcars sitting idle, was in its

discussion of assigned cars.

Those are cars assigned by a

road to a particular shipment.

It was not in respect to

general purpose freight cars., which is the classic cars to
which this order applies.

Accordingly, we urge that the

decision of the District Court should be affirmed.

Thank

you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, thank you,

Mr. Truitt.
Mr. Moloney?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF .WILLIAM M. MOLONEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

MR. MOLONEY:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I am here representing the Association of
American Railroads and its member lines.

It is my purpose

and it is my hope that I will be able to highlight some of
what we consider to be the unusual aspects of this case or
at least aspects that we consider to ba out of the ordinary.
The rhetoric used in this case may be the
inevitable result of the ease.

And you heard 'a part of that

27
from government counsel a moment ago when he referred to
cvrsr railroads, or the railroad, that owns almost'as many
t there is nothing in thi
to identify that railroad or any other railroad or how many
cars that railroad should own or whether it owns a relatively
high percentage of cars or a relatively low percentage of
cars.

This is the rhetoric mish-mash that this case really

finds itself,well, bogged down in.

We find the use of such

descriptive terms, for instance, as owner railroads and
non-owner railroads.

And we find descriptive terms such as

railroads owning an inadequate supply of freight cars and
railroads owning an adquate supply of freight cars..

¥!t: find such terms as a railroad's responsibility
being shifted for car ownership.

We find such terms as the

use by one railroad of the car belonging to another
railroad which latter railroad owns a relatively high number
of freight cars.
In a word, what we find here is an apparent
alignment of the haves against the have-nots, as far as the
railroad industry is concerned.

There is no evidence in

this record from which to define those terms or from which
to identify those railroads.

And yet it is argued by the

government that the commission's order will benefit the
haves and that it will deprive or penalize the have-nots.
There seems to be a very clear implication that the have

28
iiroads do or at least that they should support the
commission's order and that only the have-not railroads
oppose the commission’s order.

But do not be misled»

The

railroads have been unanimous in their opposition to this
commission’s carder from the very moment it was first
proposed by the commission's Bureau of Operations.»

The

government says; this proceeding was instituted to determine
whether mandatorial rules should be proposed.

The first

statements that were filed in the proceeding before the
commission were addressed to absolutely nothing.

That is,

the commission's order did nothing except to say, "Come in
with your hat in hand and let us hear from you."

It was only

when the commission's Bureau of Operations put in their own
statements and they proposed mandatory car service rules
that the railroads then said, "We cannot live with any such
provision," and they said that practically unanimously.
When I said come in with your hat in hand and it
was directed at nothing, there was a series of questions that
the commission had attached to its order,,

And our proposals

or our statements were addressed to that.

But, as the

Examiner says,

it was pretty much in a vacuum, and he laid

out the reasons why it seemed to be pretty much in a vacuum.
This

record contains no evidence at all as to which

railroads own e-i adequate or which railroads own an inadequate
supply of cars.

And, indeed, the most significant thing is

that it contains absolutely no standards by which to judge
what is adequate or by which to judge what is inadequate
either by individual railroads or, indeed, by all railroads
collectively.
1 think the Chief Justice asked the question about
cars sitting around the country.

You heard government

counsel say the commission admitted that it was unable to
find a shortage of freight cars on any particular railroad.
Obviously, if it was unable to find a shortage of cars on
any particular railroad, it was unable to find a shortage of
cars on any particular area of the country, because it would
be very simple to find car shortages on railroads in the
West, car shortages on railroads in the East, car shortages
on railroads in the South, and to point to the railroads.
But the answer was that the commission could not do that.
And we understand why.

No evidence in the record.

Now, the same uniform front of opposition to the
commission’s order applies to the shippers.

And e. peculiar

thing about that is that it applies to the shippers whether
they happen to be located on

the so-called have-not

railroads and supposedly thereby be benefited by the
commission’s -order, or whether they are located on the
unidentified have-not railroads—that is, the haves being
benefited, the have-nots being hurt.

Wherever these

■shippers are located, we find them unanimous—-unanimous in

30
oppos ition to the comxnissipn*$ order.

Indeed, you have IB

this case the National Industrial Traffic League and you
i.c.ve the National Association of Shippers Advisory Board
Put together those organisations represent somewhere in the
neighborhood, of about 35,000 shippers in the United States.
And, indeed, it has been estimated that they account for

over 30 percent of the commercial traffic in this country.
The commission justifies its order on the basis
that its primary purpose is to give the railroad owners
greater use of their own cars.
these acme railroads, because

But, as I pointed out to you,
we are practically unanimous

in this, these same railroads tell the commission no thank
you? "Your order will be unreasonable, injurious, and
detrimental to us, and it will hurt the shippers that we
serve, and furthermore your order is unlawful and we cannot
live with it."
Now, let there be no mistake.

The railroads are

;.ot .aligned in groups contending for and against this
commission's crier.

They are before you as they were before

feta commission and before the court below.

They stand here

united, for all practical purposes, united in their
opposition to the commission's order.

Ass I have often said, it's rather hard to load a car off the
peninsula of Florida without loading it hade in the
direction of the owner.

Someone must own it somewhere.

The court below is not misled by any implication
of contending factions within the ranks of the railroad
industry or within shipper ranks or indeed of any contingent
between those two ranks.
Q

What was the genesis of the order?

MR. MOLONEY:

The genesis of the order to return

the cars to the owners, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the genesis
cf the order was a determination by the commission in this
instance— and wo said so in our brief below*—a determination
by the commission in this instance that it was going to come
out with an order, period.

And this is the order that the

commission came out with.
Q

Nobody wanted any change in the status quo?

MR. MOLONEY:

No one that I know of, and I say that,

I mean no significant group of shippers.

Indeed, in the

government's brief they refer to, for instance, the
commission of the State of Oregon as supporting mandatory

32

azx aervi.ce rules.

But the Examiner in his report took up

in detail the testimony of the commission of the State of
Oregon and, inc.ead, the commission5a rules said that when
you file your evidence before us, we want you to file
evidence and we want you to file argument, and we want you
to distinguish between the two.

And everything that the

commission of Oregon said about mandatory car service rules
the Examiner said, "I find that in the argumentative section
of your presentation and I do not consider that evidence."
A£2 far as the Department of Agriculture is
concerned"*-and that's cited in the commission's brief—the
witness for the Department, of Agriculture when he took the
stand and submitted himself to cross-examination, he
admitted that they did not favor mandatory car service rules
except on a temporary basis and for the sole purpose of
accumulating statistical information which was absent from
the record..

And, indeed, when I asked that witness what he

considered to be the worth of this record, he said he did not
think that the record permitted the commission to make an
i. nte11iganfc decision.
Bs, the ICC bureau is practically the only one that
proposed this

Commission

tea, as X point out later, with one man actually.

Xn fact; wo have referred to it as inspired vision almost,
and that witness is the only one that X know of that came

out with this firm demand.
The rational transportation policy has been
mentioned.

We feel that the united front in opposition to

the commission’s order makes the national transportation
policy and the measuring of the commission’s order in this
case against that policy highly important, because here
you have for all practical purposes the shippers and
receivers of freight and the railroads that service those
shippers and receivers standing before you and saying,
"This order is unlawful and it is harmful."
Is it not then proper that you look more carefully
at the national transportation policy and how this order
comports with it?
As applied to this case, that national
transportation policy really means that the commission’s
order here must be in the interest of providing fair and
impartial regulation of railroads, of providing the shippers
with economic, adequate, and efficient railroad service, and
of fostering sound conditions in the railroad industry.
1 suppose we may treat all of these provisions of
the national transportation policy as something that would
be embraced with,in the general term of public interest.

But

34
to the questio* of wherein lies the public interest to be
served in this case, we are compelled to submit that the
answer to that question can only be found in the interest
of the receivers and the shippers of railroad freight and
of the railroads it is serving.

And if that public interest

can be found anywhere else, it escapes us,
Another twist that we find a little peculiar in
this case

is

the

commission's abrupt departure from

long-established policies and principles and with little or
no explanation as to why they departed? until the decision
in this case, there had net been a shadow of a doubt that
in times of car shortage the railroads had an obligation to
achieve and without regard to car ownership the maximum
utilization of all freight cars available,

indeed, the

national transportation policy and the public interest to
be served seemed to us to permit of no other course of
action«
But here the commission finds a car shortage.

But

it says, "We're no longer interested in obtaining maximum
utilization of freight cars during that shortage."

Instead

it orders a movement, a car movement pattern which it says
itoeIf is i-scenes is tent with the maximum utilisation of
freight cars during the time of a shortage.

And it does

this on the theory that that will fores some unidentified
totoo to buy an indeterminate number of freight cars and

35
regardless of their financial condition to do so.

Now, how

a deliberate aggravation of an existing.-what they found to
be

an existing chronic freight car shortage—how a

deliberate aggravation of feat shortage could possibly be
in the public interest and comport with the national
transportation policy is something that the commission's

*

report and orders' leaves entirely to the imagination of the •
Court.
As we see it, the commission has taken what I term
a page from the international diplomacy book, and we think
it has embarked on a course of brinkmanship.

I say that not

in jest but in seriousness, because in both the jurisdictional
statement and the brief the government says that the order
*

here in issue is one of a series of actions that it has
taken to alleviate the crisis which it finds to exist.
I’m sorry, 1 think my time has expired.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Huntington, you

have about nine minutes left.
MR. HUNTINGTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

REBUTTAL BY MR. HUNTINGTON
MR. HUNTINGTON:

With respect to Mr. Justice

Blackmun’s question, I’d simply like to point out that the
New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad was not the only
railroad to support mandatory enforcement of car rules.
B £

Of c

;• O supported the rules.,

The

That’s at page 188-189 of

36

append lie.

The Great Northern supported the rules at

page 130 of the appendix.

And the Pennsylvania Railroad

supported the rules at 193 of the appendix.

These are not

small railroads.
With respect to the argument that these rules will
not increase the utilization, or not improve the utilization
of ears, I would simply like to stress again that the purpose
here is not to increase the utilization,- the primary purpose,
but to increase the supply.

If the supply continues to

diminish, you can have the best utilization in the. world
but still be faced with a. crisis.
Q

I’m a little puzzled as to how you can

separate the. two things.

You have idle cars.

Doesn't that

create a pressure for more cars to meet the same demand?
Mh. HUNTINGTON:

X think if we look at it in terms

of the short-range effect and the long-range effect, clearly
if you're interested only in the short term, then you will
want to load whatever cars ar© available with whatever freight
to gc anywhere.

But if you are interested in the long term

to increase the supply, then you want to create a set of
circumstances which will encourage the roads to purchase new
cars, and that is what the commission has sought to do here.
They have sought to provide the railroads with an incentive,
they have sought to give the railroads greater use of their
cars so that they will then have some incentive tc go out

37
and pvrchase csrs,

They havp also sought to put the onus

on. the parthcpj ar low ownership roads that should be
purchasing new cars so that they can know that they are
deficient; There will be pressure on them to purchase new
carsf and they can justify their needs.
Penn Central, for example, which is in reorganization
has been able to purchase cars because there is pressure on
that railroad and they can go before the. Bankruptcy Court and
they can justify the need, and this is essentially what the
commission is seeking to do here, to put railroads in a
position where they will have to meet that need by taking
whatever steps are available to them.
Q

Mr. Huntington, what type of evidence was

submitted to the commission in support of its finding that
there is an acute shortage of cars and from what sources
did the evidence come?
Mb, TjKTXNGTON;

The evidence came from, first,

submissions to the commission by the railroads showing that
over a ten-year period from 1955 to 1964, the total number
of freight cars in the nation had decreased particularly
with respect to plain boxcars and the total aggregate capacity
had also decreased.
Q

Had the demand increased during that period?

MR. HONTINGTONs
a much lower level.

The demand had decreased but at

The demand had decreased by about three

*
38

•percent, whereas total capacity had decreased about five
parcent.

With reapset to plain boxcars, though, where the

shortage is the strongest, the total capacity had declined,
I believe, around 12 percent,
In addition to that, there is evidence that there
ware indeed shortages being reported by shippers, and these
were compiled in various reports submitted to the AAR and
introduced into evidence in this record.

These reports

did come under heavy attack as being somewhat exaggerated
A

and the commission fully dealt with that in its opinion,
It recognised the fact that shippers sometimes order more
cars than they need.

The AAR had in its treatment of these

figures, reduces them by 50 percent and that perhaps would
be a good ballpark method of dealing with the statistics.
Q

Was the commission motivated to act by

complaints from shippers or did it act on its own motion?
MR. HUNTINGTONs
on its own motion.

It initiated this investigation

The fact is, though, that virtually all

the shippers testifying and participating in this proceeding
testified that there was indeed a national shortage.
One other question X would like to address myself
here is the effect that this order will have on competition
and the effect chat it will have on low ownership railroads.
In their brief and here in argument, the contentions that
competiti oh rsacmg railroads will suffer seems to be based on

two assumptions; one, that small carriers no longer will
have access to a national freight car pool and, two, that
it is the small carriers who will suffer most from the rules
But neither of these assumptions is justified.

First, as

I stated before, railroads will continue to load foreign
cars.

They will use a mixture of foreign and home cars.

There is no absolute rule here that you have to send the car
back empty.

You simply have to find a car of the right

ownership and then you can load it and send it back in that
direction.
Second, many small railroads may be high ownership
roads.

That is, they may already contribute their fair

share of cars to the national pool.

And, finally, even

the assertion that the financially weak railroads will be
affected the most is somewhat undercut by the experience in
Perm Central where indeed it is shown the necessary steps
can be taken.
In conclusion I would like to say that the
Commission here could not make specific findings as to the
ownership levels on particular roads.

The data wasn't

available?to take care of this, the commission adopted a
formula in this very proceeding and the railroads are
compiling data and they already are submitting it to the
rjommission, and in the future the commission will have much
better data in which to act.

The proceeding is open for

40

that very raascn.

hs the data comes in, the commission can

take the necessity steps to modify its .’-rales.

But what they

did find here was that there was an overall shortage and
that something had to be dona, not five years from now but
right now.

And we submit that under these circumstances

the mandatory adoption of these rules at this time is
fully appropriate.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Huntington.

Thank you,

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is

submitted.
S'Whereupon, at 11:03 o'clock a.m. the case was
submitted.]
