ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. CLOUGH, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF DONALD LINDSEY ET AL., APPELLANTS
MR. CLOUGH; Mr, Chief Justice and may it please
the Courts
This is an appeal from a three-™judge court's
denial of injunctive and declaratory relief sought by
Donald and Edna Lindsey on behalf of themselves and
a class of appellants, including all tenants in the State
of Oregon.
The Lindseys attack the constitutionality of
Oregon's eviction law seeking to enjoin its enforcement of
its objectionable provisions by appellee judges.
The Lindseys had been having difficulties in getting
their landlord, Appellee Normet, to repair the condition of
their home, which condition included lack of plaster, down­
stairs toilet out of order, missing rear steps, et cetera.
Since pictures are better than words, we specifically refer
the Court to Appellant photographs in evidence marked as
Plaintiffs Exhibits No, 25 to 37 in the record.
On November 10—
Q

Those photographs are not in the appendix, are they?
MR. CLOUGH; Ho, they're not? we were unable to

4

'

print them because they are color photographs.
On November 10, 1969, their home had been condemned
by the Bureau of Building Inspections of the City of Portland
because of violation of Portland’s housing and building
codes,.

Since Donald Lindsey was substantially confined to a

wheelchair with crippling arthritis of both arms and legs,
and neither he nor his wife could drive a car, they did not
have the mobility to search for another home.
a search would have been rendered

Furthermore,

more difficult by the

fact that the overall vacancy rate in Portland was 31 ess than
2 percent, and for low income families, lass than 1 percent.
Q

Would your case be any different if this was a

25-year--old professional football player in the peak of
physical condition and health?
MR. CLOUGH; In soxne respects it might, in some
respects it might not.
Q

There are some aspects of the case—

Constitutionally?
MR. CLOUGH; Yes, some aspects of the case would make

a difference because of the indigency and ability to search
for a home, although constitutionally you’re quite correct.
Q

Let’s take an unemployed professional football player

then.
MR. CLOUGH;

You're right, constitutionally it would

make no difference.
Low income housing is that which has rents within

the financial reach of a typical family of four whose income
Is from zero to $4,090 a year»

In Portland, an estimated

75. percent of the low income families rent»
home was a low income home,

The Lindseys6

Most housing available for low

income families is quite often substandard, and the condition
is generally very poor in Portland,

Low income people pay a

higher portion of their monthly income in rent, and they
generally pay higher utility end heating bills because of
deficiencies in plumbing, insulation, and wiring,
0

Mr, Clough, is all this general material in the

record?
MR, CLOUGH5 Yes, it is, your Honor,

The last

statement, Mr. Justice B'Xackmun, was in the deposition of
Josephine Brown, our ©sqoert,- which was admitted into evidence
as Plaintiff's Bsdtifoit No,. 24 at page 26.
Low income people generally have a difficult time
finding a place because of the advance month's rent or
cleaning deposits often required.
After a request cf the landlord to repair these
<

conditions, and no action was forthcoming, they decided
to attempt to improve their lot where they lived, and with­
held their rent on December 1, 1969, to compel their landlord
to repair the premises,
••
there

Q

At any time in the course of these proceedings, was

a tender of the rent into the custody of the court?

6
MR. CLOUGH: The tender was offered at the institu­
tion of the proceedings, and the court preferred that we
as their attorneys keep the money in our escrow account,,
and specifically condition the temporary restraining order
based upon that»
Q

Well, then, it was really in the custody of the

court, and you were holding it as an officer of. the court?
MR. CLOUGH? Yes, that is correct»
On December 15, 1369, they .were sent, a letter
from their landlord’s attorney demanding them to pay rent
or vacate,

ht this point they were faced with the .realities

of having an eviction action filed against them pursuant to the
statute under attack in this appeal»

There was no question

that an eviction would cause the Lindseys irreparable harm.
Evictions of low income families often result in n continuing
downward and frightening spiral, which they find an emotional
block to overcome.

They don’t have the costs of moving

and they can’t find housing.
adequate housing.

They are often forced into less

They lose standing in the community,

and in their children’s eyes, and large families are often
split up.
With this background, this action was started in the
federal district court, prior to any eviction action beingfiled by the Lindseys’ landlord,

The best way to describe

the operation of the eviction statute is by taking the Lindseys

7
. through their eviction, had one been filed by their landlord.
A complaint and summons would be filed and served
upon the Lindseys setting a time for trial within two to four
days, which may include week ends.
Q

This didn't actually happen to the Lindseys though?
MR. CLOUGHs

Q

Mo.

This action was filed in the district court before

alleging they were threatened with this, is that right?
MR. CLOUGH; That is correct.

I am using the Lindseys

as to what would happen, in describing the operation of the
statute.

For example, they cotild be served on a Friday,,

with a trial set for Monday or Tuesday.

However, two days

is all the time for trial that the tenant has as a matter of
right.

Within this time, they would have to contact a lawyer,

make an appointment, and get him to take the case.

His first

i

move would be to ask for a continuance, and all that he could
get without posting cash security
•.

would foe two days, the

granting of which is only discretionary under the statute.
■ Even though the defenses the Lindseys would like
to raise could not be.heard by the Oregon courts because of
the statute h® is challenging.

He might still have convention-

al defenses based on issues of fact regarding what rent was
" ■ agreed to, or if it were' truly paid.
..

Litigation of these

issues may well require interviewing potential witnesses,
subpoenaing them, legal research, and trial preparation.

At trial, Lindsey would want to raise defenses
based upon his landlord’s refusal to obey the housing codes, but

these defenses
merits.

will not be heard or adjudicated on their

The .reason for this is found on the face of the

Oregon statutes.

They provide that the landlord’s complaint

is sufficient if it states;
(2)

CD a description of the premises;

that the defendant is :Ln possession?

(3) that the

defendant unlawfully holds by force., which is deemed to in­
clude failure to pay rent within 10 days after it is dues
and {4} that the landlord is entitled to possession.
The statute goes on to provide that if the court or
jury finds the complaint to be true, the tenant shall be
evicted,
Thus these statutes on their face preclude the
raising of affirmative legal defenses, and they have been so
construed by the Oregon courts,
Q

Well, Mr, Clough, how old are the Oregon statutes?

How long have they been on the books?
MR, CLOUGH;

The last time that the F.E.D., the

eviction law, was changed in any manner was in 1909,.
although the case of Friedenthal v. Thompson

goes into

historical analysis, where they were in effect back in the
middle 1800s,
Q

Has there been any endeavor to change the statutes

legislatively?

o

MR. CLOUGH s There * 3 been an effort r ye*?, Mr*
Justice Blackmun.
Q

I just wonder if one could say that possession of

the premises during a controversy such as you envision here
with the Lindseys, is a matter at issue and that your legis­
lature has come down on the side of the landlord rather
than on the side of the tenant, in deciding a policy question
X take it you don't agree with that?
MR. CLOUGH: No.

Q

No, I don't, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

For the first time in a century, you are raising

the question?
MR. CLOUGH:

The question has been raised, Mr.

Justice Blackmun, in several cases that have gone up to the
Oregon Supreme Court on various aspects? for example,
Friedenthal v. Thompson involved the constrictions on
limitations of time*

There were several cases that sought to

raise equitable types of offenses, and these were inter­
preted by the Oregon Supreme Court.
The double rent bond on appeal has been construed
by the Oregon Supreme Court and been upheld as constitutional
Legal defenses have been specifically disallowed by the
Oregon Supreme Court.
Q

Well, of course you could resolve this dilemma

by appropriate legislation, could you not?
MR. CLOUGH: Of course that would be a very welcome

10

response? but the legislature of Oregon has not seen fit
£0 ^

One of the main lines of attack that we have

here on the statute is due process? which—that doesn’t
matter.

The statute either procedurally constricts the

courts and the litigant? so that it denies clue process.
That is true of any statute.

Any statute could be changed

at any given time by the state legislature.
Under the Oregon statutes? the fact that the tenant
may have withheld rent because the landlord failed to make
proper repairs? • .or the fact that the landlord brought the
action in retaliation because the tenants had reported
code violations to a city agency or complaint to the land­
lord? or even the fact -that the action is brought because
of the tenant's race? such facts are net only considered
irrelevant? they are not even heard.
judged on their merits.

These defenses are not

They are not even heard and are

stricken.
At the conclusion of the trial? the tenant loses
and desires to remain on the premises? pending an appeal
to the circuit court? he must post si open-ended double rent
bond to guarantee twice the amount of rent to be paid? from
the inception of the action until final determination by the
appellate court.
Q

Do you object to paying into the court the rent

while the action is going on?

MR. CLOUGH;

Hot at all, as long as it becomas due

because the indigent tenant*--there * s no objection to that.
0

And you do object to paying it to the landlord?
MR. CLOUGH:

Q

If the situation is that—

That's what the case is all about,, isn’t it?
MR. CLOUGHs

Yes, if the case is such that paying

it to the landlord would defeat the whole purpose.
Q

You could sue the landlord in an independent action

in an attempt to collect for breach of lease or something.
MR. CLOUGH: That's true, but that action would not
stay this proceeding, and the whole issue here—
Q

You aren’t giving us aa3aL-xighfce^-^e4ear--4^e--Offe4f«a

MR. CLOUGH: Not in an independent action for con­
tra c t f but, the is sue here. „is-jao&aesgl£iii..of the premise s.
Q

I understand.
MR. CLOUGH: And that is the hey issue that the

tenant .is interested in.
Q

Well, he can retain possession by paying the rent

to the landlord.
MR. CLOUGH:

By continuing to pay the rent to the

landlord, but then it defeats his whole purposes.
Q

What does it defeat, if he can nevertheless recover

what you paid him?
MR. CLOUGH:

The problem with that is that it forces

12
every tenant into litigation.

Q

But you can see that in tenant litigation, you

hav© to pay the rent as it accrues anyway.

You pay it into

the court? you’re not Keeping the money.
MR. CLOUGH; That8s quite correct.
Q

You are paying the money, you're being separated

from the rant as it falls due, and you are going to separate
it as long as the issue between you and the landlord isn’t
settled.
MR. CLOUGH; And you will also be separated from your
property, if the landlord decides to follow this procedure.
0

Wot as long as you're paying the rent into the

court.
MR. CLOUGH; He could give a 30-day notice in retalia­
tion for your invoicing»., the court procedures.

What this action

would do is force him to invoke court procedures.
1

Q

I guess I don't understand.

When the landlord

brings this action, this forcible entry and retainer action
against the tenant—
MR. CLOUGH;
Q

Yes.

--now tiie tenant can retain possession if he pays

rent into the court?
)

MR. CLOUGH;

Only for the time of the continuance,

if he gets a continuance, and it must be cash in advance;
in other words, if he's an indigent tenant who has his money

13
carefully budgeted, he could not financially afford to pay
enough to get a continuance for two or three months.
Q

What do you mean—get a continuance?
MR. CLOUGHj A continuance of hearing the possessory

action, the action for eviction»
Q

What does the action have to put up to get a

continuance, how much money?
MR. CLOUGHi That would vary depending on how much
time he asked for the continuance.
Q

Suppose he -has to put up' any money in any event

that he *3 in default on, in the first place?
MR. CLOUGH? Presumably under our situation he'd
have that money he was in default on, and there would be
no objection to that.
Q
money«

And then as rent falls due, he has to put up some
MR. CLOUGH? We would have no objection to that,

but that's not the way the statute operates, as it's written.
You have to post cash in advance.

In other words, if he

desires a continuance for two months, he would right then and
there have to put up cash and guarantee it for two months.
Q

Mr. Clough, I, seem to have missed something.

When

1 first asked you about depositing the rent in the custody
of the court or under the control of the court, I thought your
response was this was done as a discretionary matter by the

judge i» not as a matter of any requirement under the Oregon
statute.

Will you clear that up for me?

Does the Oregon

statute require the payment of the money, the rent in escrow?
MR. CLOUGHs Oh—no, it does not, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

My first impression was correct then.
MR, CLOUGHt Your first impression was correct.

1

thought that you were referring to the Federal court action.
The court 'below adopted the escrow arrangement,
Q

That was the three-judge court?
MR. CLOUGHs Yes,

Q

And would you think that was a reasonable condition,

uniformly to be attached to any right to maintain possession?
MR. CLOUGHs

Perfectly reasonable, or some variation.

However, the court felt this would be something for the state
courts to work out.
Q

If you didn't have that deposit in escrow, might you

not be confronted with a counter-suggestion that this * a
faking of property without clue process, without compensation?
MR. CLOUGHs Of course; that is correct.
Q

But you would accept that as an invariable condition

to maintainirwr possession?
MR. CLOUGH; Yes, we’d have no problem with that
whatsoever„
The double rent bond on appeal is in addition to the
usual cost bond.

This bond may be filed as a cash bond,

15
personal bond, or appropriate surety bond, in any evekt
with two sureties.
or a year.

It is open-ended and may last for a month

Within five days after the posting of the bond,

the landlord can require justification of the sureties by
their presence in court.

At the conclusion of the appeal,

if the tenant loses, the landlord simply executes on the bond,
or if the money has been paid into court, upon the filing
of the order, it is simply disbursed.
The landlord collects the entire amount of the
bond, not just his damages or expenses, if any.

If the

tenant loses in the circuit court, he may appeal to the state
supreme court, and the same process is again repeated.
We are challenging the three major restrictions
on the low income tenant’s ability to properly defend himself
in Oregon.
These are, first, the short time to prepare for
trial.
Two, the refusal of the court to hear his defenses.
And three, the denial of his ability to appeal
because of the double rent bond requirement.
We contend that these restrictions violate both
equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment because they affect certain fundamental interests
of the tenant.

The first of these fundamental interests is

his right to retain peaceful possession of his home or the

16

sanctity of the home.

Second is his right to decent housing.

Third, his right to meaningful access to and equal treatment
in the courts.
While all of these interests have been treated
as fundamental in this Court in various decisions, the right
to retain peaceful possession of one’s home has received
the most attention of the Court, being protected under the
Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments.
For example, in Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S., this
Court rejected evidence obtained by the use of a ’’spike mike,'5
which, intruded several inches into the wall of the defendant’s
home., as,, it was obtained by actual intrusion into a constitu­
tionally - protected area. In Camara v. Municipal Court at 387
U.S., this Court held that a warrant must be obtained before
homes can be inspected by the city agencies, and in Rowan v.
United States Post Office Department, this Court upheld in
the face of a First Amendment attack the statute protecting
householders from junk mail intrusions.
If this Court has found the sanctity of the home
to be worthy of constitutional protection against these
sporadic intrusions, how much more worthy of protection is
the right to be free from a total ousting of possession?
total ousting by the county sheriff is what faces a tenant
who loses an eviction action in Oregon, as is almost inevi­
table under the procedures we are challenging

In addition

I?
certain of the restrictions we are dealing with involve a
suspect classification# one based upon wealth# since indigent
tenants do not have the resources to post either the con­
tinuance bond or the double rent appeal bond.
We do not feel we are asking for anything unreason­
able in this case.

We fully recognise that there are certain

interests of the landlord that the State of Oregon may
reasonably protect if it wishes to do so.

The main interest

meant to be protected by the restrictions that we are chal­
lenging is the landlord's desire to see that, he will not lose
rent money he may have coming to him during the litigation
that he eventually might win. Statutes designed to protect
this interest should be constitutional if they are reasonable
but the restrictions involved here go too far.

They are

unreasonable, at the expense of the tenant's interest in
protecting his home.
We can understand# for example# shortening the time
to prepare for trial in an eviction action to something less
than that available to other defendants# but only two days
as a matter of right is so short as to make a mockery of the
j u&icia ,1 sys ten;,
Q

Would you be here if that were 20 days# Mr, Clough?
MR. CLOUGH:

that issue.

If that were 20 days# probably not on

It would depend entirely on how the Oregon

courts set up the procedure.

Ill

Q

Hell,

Oregon system?

what are the

defenses- available under the

Payment is one, isn't it?

MR. CLOUGHs yes, payment is one»

There are certain

equitable types of defenses, such as showing that the agreemenfc between the parties was something aside from what its
apparent nature was, and their true relationship was not that
of landlord-tenant, such as a deed is really a mortgage, and
therefore the eviction procedure should not be used, the other
Oregon procedure should be used in that circumstance»
Q

What appears to be a tenancy at will might be

a month-to-month, what appears to be a month-to-month night
be an actual lease for a year?
MR. CLOUGH: No, they'd still be landlord-tenant,
Q

Is it available as a defense is what I mean.
MR. CLOUGHs

That there is in fact a lease for a

year, a hidden lease,that may be a defense clapending on the
circumstances of the case, but again we’re dealing with that
fourth item in the complaint, the landlord’s right to
possession, not the third item which we are concerned with,
with raising any contractual defenses.
Q

My thought was that it can81 be both ways. In other

words, you say on the one hand that Oregon doesn’t allow you
to make any real defense; and on the other, that you should be
given more time to make defenses.

Hell, if there are not

defenses to be made, length of time isn’t very—

19
MS, CLOUGH;

Length of time is contingent on the

ability to raise these defenses, of course.
Q

May X ask you in the F.E.D. suit, in response to

it, you not only claim you ire not in default but the statute
itself is not constitutional, and you'd get a constitutional
decision in that case, and if you could afford the appeal
bond, appeal any rejection on constitutional grounds?
MR. CLOUGH; in theory that would he available,
Q

Not*? these P.E.D. suits were pending at the time you

went to Federal court?
MR. CLOUGH; There was none filed in the Lindsey
case.
Q

They were in the others?
MR. CLOUGH; There were three others, and for various

reasons those three cases were settled and were never appealed.
Q

And what is the case of controversy between the

one person and that landlord?

Had he threatened eviction,

or—
MR. CLOUGH:

The case in controversy is he threat­

ened eviction and invoked the use of the courts.
Q

But he never did?
MR. -CLOUGH; But he never did because of this action.

0

I see.
MR. CLOUGH; Because there was a restraining order

issued in this action.

Q

Let's back up to a case where there is a tenancy

from month to month, and for reasons not disclosed, the land­
lord decides that he wants to terminate the tenancy.

He

gives the appropriate notices and at the end of the notice
period, the tenant declines to leave, claiming that it is
very inconvenient, there is no other housing available to
him, et cetera.

Now do you say there's a due process right

to remain which in turn will enable him to remain in possession notwithstanding the landlord's compliance with the
statote in giving him notice?
MR. CLOUGH t Hot in the facts of the situation you
gave to me, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

In other words, in that situation, the landlord

can evict?
MR, CLOUGH;
0

He would have no defenses.

Ho.defense.
MR. CLOUGH;

However if he were raising the defense

that he should be entitled to at least raise and toe heard
on the defense that the landlord is evicting him, for example,
in retaliation, put testimony in, but that is not the facts
of the situation you gave.
Q

Or perhaps the one-year lease or the things Mr.

Justice Stewart was talking about, as an alternative.
MR. CLOUGH;
Q

Yes.

If you have a clear case of that kind, where there

is no valid defense,then you concede the landlord can evict?
MS. CLOUGH: Of course.

There is no denial of

due process because a defense hasn’t been raised.
Q

Than the two cases wouldn’t be a problem for yon

in. that circumstance?
MR. CLOUGH: Yes, but the statute is over-inclusive
because it includes these other situations, too.

There’s

no differentiation between that type of situation and
the type of situation where the tenant seeks to raise
retaliatory eviction as a defense.
Q

Then you come down to a claim of unconstitutionality

of the statute as applied rather than facially, isn’t that
right?
MS. CLOUGH?

It would be on its face, because the

statute is over-inclusive on its face.
Q

1

suppose it’s sisc of one and a half a dozen of the

other as applied to this specific case, isn’t it?
MR. CLOUGH:

It might be both, yes.

,

I’d like to reserve ray time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP THEODORE B. JEKSEN,.- 'ESQ .
m

BEHALF OF THE &PBLXJBBS.

MR* JBHSENs

Mr. Chief Justice,•Members of the Court

I am appearing here for th© defendant, Mrs. bonnet.

22

The factual situation in the case actually, as
we see it, was that Frs. Normat was the record owner of the
property but had become so with an outstanding contract of
sale on the property .to a party who had in turn rented the
property to the Lindseys.
When Mrs. Normet on default on this contract under
which the property had bean sold, and a more or less of an
abandonment of it by the contract purchaser;, Firs. Normet began
to

and she did receive the rent payments from the

Lindseys up through November, applied them on the contract of
sale, and commenced a suit to foreclose the contract in order
to clear up the title of the property.
Then in November the City of Portland, under its
housing code, notified both the Lindseys, they being the ten­
ants, and Mrs. Normet that the property was substandard in a
good many respects and posted a notice that the property be
vacated or the repairs made. At that point, Mrs. Normet through
her attorney gave a notice to the Lindseys requesting them to
vacate the property in accordance with the order of the City
of Portland, she not wanting to go ahead and spend the money
which would be required to make the repairs, because of the
existing cloud on the title to the property at that particular
time.
Now the trial court made a finding that there was a
landlord-tenant relationship between Mrs.'Normet and the Lindseys

23
and treat it as if it were an, ordinary landlord-tenant
relationship.
In this case we view the summary of the argument
and the briefs of the Appellant that they are saying on
two grounds? that the Oregon eviction statutes are uncon­
stitutional because they do not grant equal protection
and due process at law? and that they deprive tenants of
rights and privileges accorded to them in the civil eviction
actions in Oregon by denying basic rights needed to enable
them to receive fundamentally fair hearings on their defenses.
Now l would like first of all to direct my remarks
to the Oregon eviction law briefly.

First of all, the Ore­

gon eviction law is only available or is only used when
there exists a landlord-tenant relationship. It doesn’t
apply in any other situation.

It protects,our position is

that it protects all tenants equally.

It doesn’t make any

distinction as to what their funds may he that they have
available to them, whether they’re rich or poor, it just
applies and gives equal protection to all tenants.
•.'First of all, we have no self-help procedure
in Oregon? that is, where the landlord can go in and evict
the tenant himself.

If he wants to evict a tenant from the

property, he has to go in. to the court and get a determina­
tion that he has the right to take possession from the tenant.
He can do this if the tenant has failed to pay the rent within

24
ten days after due, or if the tenant's lease has expired and
the tenant has refused to get out, or if the tenant’s month
to month or what tenancy or whatever the term is, has been
terminated on either 30 days' notice, or if it’s a longer
tenancy, why, then on a notice equivalent to the term.

And

then if the tenant refuses to vacate the landlord must, in
order to have a determination then of his right to fake
possession, he must go in and file a complaint in court.
It is setting forth a kind of notice sort of a complaint,
at least the equivalent of the Federal Rules requirements
in which he in effect says that the tenant is withholding the
premises unlawfully and with force, and that the landlord
is entitled to possession.

That’s the only issue in the

F.E.D. case at that point in the complaint,

Q

As 1 understand it, under Oregon law the landlord

is not permitted to join with that F.E.D, complaint any other
claim; e.g,, a claim for the payment of back rent. Is that
right?
MR. JENSEIJs

Mr. Justice, that is correct, and. if

he does join—he can join an action for rent, if he wishes
to do so, or any other action that might be joinable under
our statute, but. if he does, then the F.E.D. procedure is not
followed, the summary procedure is not followed and the case
is subject to the ordinary trial procedure, and instead of
the two to four days which the summons would state, it would

be ten days if served in the county, 20 days in any other
county where the individual did not actually reside.
Q

And it . becomes just like any other contract

action?
MR. JENSEN? Yes, sir, and any and all defenses,
including counterclaims, could be raised then in the action,
Q

If the Plaintiff joins anything except the eviction,

then defenses would be available, and it would become an
ordinary lawsuit?

This summary procedure would no longer

take place.
MR. JENSEN: Yes, that is correct, Mr. Justice.
As a matter of practice, most P.E.D. cases in the
simple landlord—tenant relationship of rental of a residence
on a 'month-to-month basis are filed just for possession
without joining any rent or any other cause of action with it.
Mow, I think the court should realize that the F„E.D„ eviction
laws of Oregon apply not only to the rental of residences
but it applies and is available and used in connection with
commercial properties, where there is a lease for example,
and the tenant has refused to vacate at the end of the
lease, with most leases providing if they hold oyer at the end
of the term, then they are month-fco-monthy tenants? then you
v?ould have to give 30 days' notice and bring your P.E.D.
action.

But you can see that in cases; involving commercial

property where the tenant may find it a tremendous financial

25

advantage to him to remain in a particular property for
another year or so, it would be unfair to permit him to stay
in just by continuing to pay his rent, if the landlord
has given him the 30 day's notice and his lease term is over.
How,, we have personal service in Oregon of the
summons and complaint on the tenant, and the summons provides
that the matter will come before the court and the return made
from two to four days? the day of service is not counted.
So it comes up then before the court at that time, and there
need not be any written answer filed.

We have a procedure

in the Oregon law which grants to the defendant tenant
two more days continuance without any shewing of any kind.
He can have art additional two days continuance, and then
if that isnot a sufficient amount and he wishes to have a
further continuance, that can be obtained by posting security
for the payment of his rent, to cover the period of the time
for the continuance he wants.

In other words, the practical

aspect of that is that he doesn’t have to go back and pay his
delinquent rent? that isn’t an issue in the case—it* s
possession.

If he wants to remain in possession and get a

continuance of the case for more time for preparation or
for whatever the reason may be, he can do so from a practical
aspect by paying the month’s rent, and that would give him
a 30'~day extension of time.
Q

Pays it into court?

21
MR. JENSEN; There’s no provision, Mr. Chief
Justicef for the payment of the rent into court. I assume
that the trial court could make that provision.
Q

Does the court have inherent power to do that?
MR„- JENSENs I believe it would. It has been the

practice in Oregon particularly.
Q

Did thathappen in this case?
MR. JENSEN: No, it did not.

The thing about this

case is that there was no F.E.D. eviction commenced by Mrs.
Normet against the Lindseys.

The claim here is that Mrs.

Normet had threatened commencing an eviction case against
them, but there actually was no case filed.
Q

X thought there was a letter from the lawyer to

the Lindseys threatening a lawsuit?

Is that correct?

MR. JENSEN: X think that counsel would agree with
me that we have a different interpretation of the notice
that was sent by Mrs. Normet's attorney to the Lindseys.
It appears it was a letter—it appears in the appendix—
it's an exhibit in the case, Exhibit No. 14.

The appellees'

interpretation of the letter was that it was a notice or
demand or request for the Lindseys to comply with the order
issued by the City of Portland Building Department for the
premises to be vacated because it was substandard.
Q

Mr. Jensen is personal service required in Oregon?
MR. JENSEN:

Yes, it is

28
Q

In the amicus brief there's a good deal of talk

about so-called sewer service, because I gather that in many
states service by attaching the process to the door of a house
is sufficient, and process servers often find it more con­
venient to do that.

I wonder if failure to make personal

'service would be a defense in this action?
MR. JENSEN: Yes, it would be.
Q

Now, 1 would say—

Suppose the defendant comas into court, enters

an appearance, could he make that defense under a special
appearance?
MR. JENSEN's Yes, he could enter a special appearance
to quash the service.
Q

If there was no personal service.
MR'. JENSEN:

Yes, to quash whatever the service

was, and he can reserve that by making a special—
Q

If for want of personal service, the tenant never

did have actual notice of this proceeding, then what happens?
MR. JENSEN:

Well, the service in the P.E.D. case

is the same as in any other action in the State of Oregon.
We have personal service, but you can have substituted sar-*vice by publishing; there could be a publishing, which if the
person is concealed within the state or is outside the state
and his location is not known, but in support of that there
would have to be an affidavit prepared and filed, which
contains facts sufficient to show there had been a reasonable

29
search made for the party before the publication of the sum­
mons .
Q

Outside the state you wouldn't bring an eviction

proceeding, would you?
MR. JENSEN: Well, depending on had he left some of
his belongings in the property perhaps, or something of that
nature, you might be taking a chance to go in and have selfhelp of taking possession of the property, but the service
/•

is no

different in an F.E.D. eviction case in Oregon than

it is in any other case, so we do not have what is called
conspicuous service or so-called sewer service.

1 noticed

in the Amicus briefs they have it in New York and Florida.
We do not have that; werequire personal service.
Either party can request and have a jury trial,
if the tenant-—and that's to determine the possession—and
the tenant can interpose defenses which are relevant to the
question of possession.
Q

And those defenses would mainly be whether or not he

paid the rent?
MR. JENSEN:

Payment of rent or that he has a lease

on the property, he's not been given notice, things of that
nature which are relevant to the possession.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume after

lunch.
(Whereupon, at 11:42 o * clock, a.m, the argument

was races sad,, to be resumed after lunch.)

31
AFTERNOON SESSION

(1:00 p.m.)

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER% Mr. Jensen, you may
proceed with your argument.

You have 13 minutes remaining.

MR. JENSEN: Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the
Court;
The Oregon eviction procedure does not deprive
either the tenant or the landlord of the right to assert other
claims they may have under the general court procedure which
is available to all. In other words, they have open to them
the general court procedure for litigating any other claims
they may have against each other, arising out of the rent
agreement or the rent contract.
Now the Appellants seem to argue here that all
defendants should be treated equally and that it's wrong to
have a separate eviction procedure to determine possession
of rented property between the landlord and tenant.

In

support of that they compare a mortgage foreclosure with
an F.E.D. case under Oregon law and then say that since the
procedure is different, that the tenant defendants in an
F.E.D. case do not receive equal protection or the same
protection as an owner of real property whose mortgage
being foreclosed.

They claim therefore that the F.E.D

procedure or eviction is unconstitutional.

Certainly there *

a vast difference between the owner of real property who
is delinquent in payment of a mortgage and a tenant who does

32
not pay his rent.

It seems to me that we certainly wouldn't

require a landlord first to obtain a judgment for the rent,
and then hold some sort of judicial sale to evict' the tenant
terminating his right to possession of the property, perhaps
even with some redemption rights or have some sort of strict
foreclosure proceeding which would grant the tenant some
period of time to pay up his delinquency before the landlord
could retake possession of his property from a defaulting
tenant.
I submit that the summary eviction procedure is
justified because of the intending rights existing in a
landlord-tenant relationship, and the Oregon eviction law
grants equal protection to all landlords and tenants.
The State of Oregon has the right to establish by legislative
enactment a summary procedure to determine the issue of pos­
session between landlords and tenants and that is what it
has done with its statutes and laws.
Now I’d like to make a comment or two with regard
.to the amicus curiae briefs that were filed in this case,
primarily to make the point that the Oregon eviction laws
do provide due process to tenants in compliance with the
United States Constitution.

First of all, we have no self-

help provision in Oregon for the landlord as there is in
j
.Arkansas and Arizona* under- their unlawful detainer statutes
■i

,

‘•■«which require some sort. of bond from the tenant to keep

33
possession prior to trial.

Before the landlord in Oregon

can take any steps toward recovering possession, he has to
file and commence a case in court under the eviction statute,
filing a complaint.

We do not have what is called conspic­

uous service or so-called sewer service in Oregon, as they
apparently have in New York and Florida? Oregon requires
personal service or the same service as in any other litiga­
tion in the Oregon courts.
We dp not permit an oral complaint as in Kentucky.
Oregon requires a written complaint filed and a summons
issued.

We permit continuances? we do not refuse to grant a

continuance as in New Hampshire.

Oregon grants a two-day

continuance without any cause on request, and an unlimited
continuance if security is posted for the rent, which may he
found due during a continuance period. In other words, you
could pay your current rent, get a 30-day continuance.
In Kentucky from its amicus curiae brief is a state­
ment that the trial is before a court not presided over by
judges.

Oregon courts are all presided over by legally

trained judges, and jury trial on request.
Oregon does not allow in the F.E.D. eviction, the
landlord to recover both possession and judgment of money
damages as in the California and New Hampshire States? in
Oregon if you join the rent, claim or any other claim that
you have, then you have to make the usual service as you would

•in other eases# and it proceeds accordingly.
In some states# referring primarily to California#
observed from the amicus curiae brief they allow the F.E.D.
eviction procedure to be used by the purchaser at an execution
mortgage foreclosure# to recover possession I suppose# after
the sale of the property at sheriff’s sale# if the former
owner doesn’t voluntarily surrender possession of the property
They also allow to be used# to recover possession under and
after a trustee’s sale under a trustee’s deed# to evict the
former owner.

Oregon has no such statute.

Our eviction sta­

tute is related and confined entirely to the landlord-tenant
relationship.
Oregon does not deny defenses to be raised in evic­
tion proceedings# as in Arizona.

We permit in Oregon

equitable defensas relevant to the right of possession.
Oregon does not require a bond to appeal covering
the past# present and future rent as in Vermont and Mew York.
The bond in Oregon on appeal, if the tenant wishes to remain
in possession# is for twice the rental value only for the
period# only for the period from commencement >£ action to
final judgment.
Q

What is the purpose of the double rent?
MR. JENSEN 5

The purpose of that is stated in the

case of Scalas v» Spencer# Oregon Supreme /.Court# 19S7# in
which it said that inasmuch as a final judgment for

35
restitution does not include a judgment for rent pending
appeal, it appears obvious that the legislative purpose
for requiring this particular bond on appeal was to guarantee
that the rent pending on appeal would be paid.
Q

But it’s double.
MR. JENSENi

That the bond must provide for double

surrender value was no doubt intended to prevent frivolous
appeals for the purpose of delay.

If there were not some

added cost or restriction, every ousted tenant would appeal
regardless of the justification. It can also be assumed that
the additional payment would compensate for waste or is in
lieu of damages for the unlawful holding over,
Q

Is there any other provision in Oregon law that

requires double the amount?
MR, JENSENt No, there's not, Mr. Justice.

If the

tenant wants to appeal and remain in possession, then the
Oregon eviction law provides for the double rent bond.

If

he surrenders possession, and wants to appeal, which was done
in. the Friester v. Thrall case cited in the briefs, then
he does not have to put up the double rent bond? he can put
up the bond provided for in the usual undertaking section
of the Oregon statute which would be for —
0

Cos ts ?
MR. JENSEN:

—costs and disbursements and any

damages that might be incurred in the nature of waste, I think

36

Q

Would you say that posting of a

bond for double

the rent might discourage a person from appealing?

MR, JENSENs

I think it would discourage frivolous

appeals, and I suppose as the Appellants here are claiming,
that—
Q

How does Oregon handle other frivolous appeals,

in other cases?
MR. JENSEN;

Well, we have a supersedeas bond

which in damage: cases, if you want to stay the execution of
any judgment or court order, you have to put up a supersedeas
bond <,
Q

But that’s only liable for what is actually lost,

is it not?
MR. JENSEN; Yes, it is,
Q

But this is double what’s lost,
MR. JENSEN: Yes.

Our position with regard to that

is to permit the tenant to remain in possession by just
continuing to pay just the rent would mean that he could stay
in for a year, probably, or longer, depending on how long it
took the case to progress through the courts? and 1 would
point out that, that ha could do that if the landlord—now
this applies, the eviction procedure applies not just to
delinquent rent cases but applies where the landlord might
want to take the property, we’ll say, off the market.

Maybe

he has other use he wishes to put the property to, taybe

37
he wants to have It occupied by some member of his own family.
In other words, our position is there are rights in the land­
lord, in his property, and he's entitled, to that protection
and if you do not preserve or protect the rights of the land­
lord, then you would be depriving him of his property rights
without some due process.
Q

Mr. Jensen, Judge Goodwin in his opinion for the

three-judge district court, referred to this appeal on
provision as perhaps the most difficult question in this
case, and the statute provides for the posting of the bond
for double the amount of rent that will accrue pending the
appeal. How can you tell how much that will be?
tell how long the appeal will take?

How can you

How in actual operation

does this work?
MR, JENSEN: Well, 1 don't know that you could
actually tell.

The court then would have to set the amount

of the bond which is what is generally done.
Q

By making an estimate of how long the appeal will

take?
MR, JENSENi Yes.

Q

Then can it bs increased or decreased?
MR. JENSENi Well, generally that is not the case.

It is generally fixed and that goes on in connection with the
appeal.
Q

Is it generally a sort of arbitrary estimate, three

30
months, four months, five months, or don’t yon know?
ME. JENSENi I am not certain of that because there
have not been very many appeals.
Q

What kind of bond is commonly employed?
MR.JENSEN: In other cases--

Q

In this case?
MR. JENSEN 2 What kind of bond?

Q

Yes.
MR. JENSEN; It can be a personal or a surety bond.

Q

What kind is usually used in Oregon?
MR. JENSEN; Well, the landlord would have a right

to question the sureties, if it’s a personal surety, and if
they could not justify by showing that they had twice the
property, equal to twice the value of the bond, over and above
property exempt from execution, why then 'the court would not
approve those sureties.

But it’s up to the court, and in many

cases, the answering party would question the sureties
if they’re personal sureties, but that doesn’t mean he would
have a right to discredit them if they qualified.

That would

be up to the court.
Q

£\nd if the tenant lose3 the appeal, does the Appellee

landlord automatically get payment of the full amount?
MR. JENSEN;

That is the theory of the eviction

statute and the bond.
Q

That is because of the fact that he cannot, in the

.39

eviction action, collect the rent?
MR. JENSENs That’s correct.

Ha would not collect

any rent and he would be being deprived of possession of the
property,, and it's sort of a liquidated damage amount
is the way it is treated and viewed.
Q

Are there any decisions as to whether or not this

can b© waived by the court'?
MR. JENSENt It could be waived by the parties.
1 don’t believe the court would have the right to waive
the bond.
Q

In view of the explicit statutory—
MR. JENSEN? Yes, if the tenant surrenders possession,

then he can gc ahead and appeal.
0

Suppose the court says it will be three months®

,!I want you to post three months’ rent, a bond of twice the.
value of three months' rent,” and the case is decided in one
month.

Dees he get that whole bond?
MR. JENSEN;

No, he would get. only the amount which

has accrued, as I understand it, up to the time of the deter­
mination of the case.
Q

The statute is cast in terms of double the rent,

and therefore if it were 30 days, he would get double 30
days' rent; is'that right?
MR* ,JENSEN; That is my understanding, Mr. Chief
Justice,

40
Q

That's all he would get?
MR. JENSEN;

Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, Mr. Jensen.
You have four minutes left, .Mr. Clough.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN H. CLOUGH, ESQ.
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. CLOUGH; Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the
Court j
I have just a few comments.

Contrary to the

apprehensions here that have been cast, we still need time
to prepare for conventional defenses, and we still maintain
that the two-day time limit, as a matter of right, is too
short to even prepare for those, such as to find out the
issues as to what was agreed to? there may be witnesses to
testify as to whether or not in fact rent has been paid,
or whether rent receipts are available.

In connection with

that, the attorney still has to ascertain whether or not
there is, in fact, a valid defense, and he needs more time
in order to do that.
The third point is regarding the joining of the
action for rent and the F.E.D.

In our brief at page 48,

Footnote 13, we cited two statutory provisions which provide
that the action for rent can be joined with an F.E.D. but
at that pant, the case is severed and the action for rent
proceeds as any other lawsuit? the F.E.D. proceeding goes

forward.
The fourth point I refer to Plaintiff’s Exhibit No.
14, which ia the letter sent to the Lindseys by the Normets’
attorney; it speaks for itself regarding whether or not it
threatened eviction,
Essentially all that Appellants are asking for
is a chance to be able to change the law in Oregon,

We

do not ask this Court to change any substantive rule of
law; that is for the courts of Oregon to do, and that is for
thorn to use the principles of the common law and we would seek
to have them adopt the consumer protection principles that
have been analogized in landlord-tenant law in other juris­
dictions, which they are free to do absent this statute.
We are essentially asking for a chance.
Q

Within, the framework of this case and the issues

posed, could this statute hypothetically be saved by saying
that Oregon must give the same time to answer in these cases
as in any other civil action by reference to the particular
statute, the 10- and 20-day statute'?
MR. CLOUGH %

You mean by construction of the statute?

There is no construction of the statute-—the statute is very
explicit,
Q

But you want 10 or 20 days, don’t you?
MR, CLOUGH: We want whatever is a reasonable enough

period of time in order to answer.

Q

You conceded earlier this morning that the conven­

tional statutory time to answer in actions in Oregon -of 10
to 20 days was a reasonable time.
MR. CLOUGH: Oh, yes.
Q

If you got that, you’d be satisfied, wouldn’t you?
MR. CLOUGH: Sure, on the time limitation.

Q

I’m not suggesting it can be done that way. X

ask whether that is what you want.
MR. CLOUGH: On the time limitations that would be
true.
Q

And that would dissolve this whole case?
MR. CLOUGH: Mo, it would not dissolve this whole

case.
Q

What would remain?
MR. CLOUGH: The ability to rai.se defenses would

still remain and the double rent bond on appeal, and the
continuance bond. Those issues are still in this case, no
matter what happens to the time limitations.
You still have the constrictions of the statute
that would apply, no matter whether he had 10 days, SO
r

days, or 2 days.
Q

Do you know how this double rent bond on appeal

actually works in practice?
MR, CLOUGH: It is an open-ended bond, Mr. Justice.
It is for no specified amount.

It's a virtual impossibility

to obtain a surety bond.

The surety bond, companies just

won’t write them*
Q

How many appeals have there been?
MR. CLOUGHj We have the Oregon cases that are listed

in the brief, Scales v. Spencer and Priester v. Thrall
specifically dealing with the double rent bond on appeal,
and describe how it operates.

The other types of case© are

appeals that have been taken, but quite effectively it doss
preclude almost any right to appeal, and most of those cases
involve commercial leases, not residential leases.
Q

Seales v. Spencer and what were the others?
MR. CLOUGHs Scales v. Spencer and Pr.iester v. Thrall

involve the double rent bond on appeal.

Friedenthal v. Thompson

involves the time limitations and the ability to raise an
equitable defense.

There the equitable defense was of the

nature, of asserting a subsequent modification of a written
lease, an oral modification.

Hopka v. Forbes, heathers v.

Peterson, Share v. Williams are similar type cases, and that
is it—and Menefee Lumber Company v. Abramson—those cases.
Q

Mr. Clough, did 1 understand Mr. Jensen to say

that all equitable remedies were available?
MR. CLOUGH: 1 believe that is what he implied, but
that is not the case under Oregon law.
Q

How do we find that out—by reading those cases?

Do those cases reveal it?

MR. CLOUGHs
of the statutes.

Those cases reveal it, and an analysis

You see, the cases involving raising of

so-called equitable matter do not operate as a stay per se
of the eviction action? they must then proceed to determine
whether or not the issues raised would operate to stay.
In other words, an example in Leathers v„. Peterson, the
question was whether or not there was a deed or mortgage
in conveyance of the land.

There the parties were dealing

at less than arm's length.

It was a question of fraud, in the

inducement.
Well, if it did operate as a mortgage as opposed
toll deed, then there wouldn't be any validity to using the
F.E.D. action.

There would be another action that would

have to be available, so it goes to Item 4 on the allegations
of the complaint, whether or not the landlord has a right
*

to possession.

.

What we are dealing with is Item 3, which

explicitly says if the rent has not been paid within 10 days
after it comes due, that's it, he's cut off, and he has no
more defenses in Oregon courts.

He just seeks a fair chance

is all
