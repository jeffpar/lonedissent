MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: We will hear arguments
first in No. 70-5064, Jefferson against Hackney.
Mr. Cole, yon may proceed whenever you're ready.
ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. COLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. COLE:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, may it please

the Court ?
With the Court's permission I would like to save five
minutes of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER% Very well.
MR. COLE: The State of Texas provides public
assistance to four groups of its needy residents, and receives
over $350 million a year from the United States for this
purpose.
The four groups are:

the children deprived of parental

car and support, because of the absence, death, or incapacity
of the parent; persons over age 65; the. disabled; and the blind.
These are the persons both Congress and the State of
Texas have identified as needing financial assistance because
they do not nave a breadwinner in the household.
Texas has established a welfare program covering
all four groups in its Public Welfare Act of 1941, pursuant to
a single provision of the Texas Constitution.
There are two separate issues presented by this

4
appeal»
Thn first is whether the equal protection clause arm

'.-title

the 1964 Civil Rights Act permits Texas to pay

AFDC recipients, eight-ninths of whom are black and MexicanAmerican, 50 percent of the amount Texas has determined to he
their minimum required need, while it pays all other welfare
recipients; those receiving aid under the Old Age, Aid to the
Blind, and Aid to the Disabled programs, three-fifths of whom
are white, 95 or 100 percent of the same minimum need»
The statutory issue presented today is whether Texas
may, consistent with the Social Security Act, as construed by
this Court in Bosado vs. Wyman, determine eligibility for AFDC
and the amount of AFDC payments by subtracting outside income
from 50 percent of the standard of need, rather than from the
standard of need itself»
Both issues must be decided by the Court, since a
victory on either one for the appellants would still leave, the
other in dispute.
The starting point for understanding both issues is
the standard of need.

This has been referred to by the Court

in Rosado as the yardstick for determining who is eligible for
public assistance.

The- standard is a dollar amount which

represents the State's judgment as to what is necessary to
provide a subsistence level of living in that particular State.
In Texas, the items included in the standard are:

5
t; '.-sonal needs, which include food, clothing, and personal
Incidentals; shelter cost? and a few special need items»
Texas uses a single standard for all welfare
recipients in the State regardless of the category under which
■she recipient receives his assistance.
0

In other words,, children under the AFDC have

the same standard of need as blind adults or disabled adults
or people over 65?
HR* COLE:

No, that’s not exactly right, Your Honor.

What happened is Texas has a standard budgetary allowance.

So,

for example, shelter needs are budgeted according to the house­
hold size and not according to the category.
personal needs are budgeted according to age.

Similarly,
Adults in the

ADC program, the caretaker, the mother caring for her children,
receive the same budgeted needs

not receive, but are

budgeted for the same needs as adults in the Aid to the Blind
program or Old Age Assistance program.
Children, be they dependents of an Old Age recipient
or dependents of an ADC mother, are budgeted for the same amount
in each program.
Texas has made a judgment, and we do not challenge
it in this case.

The children require less per month than an

adult to survive the same minimum needs.

But. we have not

challenged that in this lawsuit.
An example of how this works is at page 41 and 42 of

6
our brief, and it might be helpful if X refer to that.
In Table I we have set forth an aged couple, both
receiving Old Age Assistance -- that's at page 41 — and the
State has determined that for each month that couple needs
$172 per month for personal and shelter needs.
On page 42, at Table II, is a mother and three
children who receive AFDC from the State of Texas.

Their

monthly needs have been defined by the State of Texas now to
be $182 a month, or just slightly more than the two'-person
family receiving OAA.
Now,

hese amounts for both families are approxi­

mately $2100 a year, and we ask the Court to bear in mind that
this standard is far from generous•

The United States defined

the official poverty level is about $3900 a year for a family
of four, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics Lower Living
Budget is over $6500 a year.
In any case, we are not challenging in this lawsuit
the fact that Texas defines the need of a family of four, with
three children, to be only slightly greater than the needs of
a. family of two.

We accept that judgment. Texas has made it.

We are not questioning it.
We also are not questioning the fact that that
standard for both of those families is defined so inadequately.
That's not at issue in this lawsuit.
judgment

We again accept that

Our position is that having determined the subsistence
needs of both families, Texas may not discriminate in the
percentage of those needs it chooses to meet for the various
groups of recipients»
In practical terms, what has happened is that Texas
has told the family in Table 1 that since they are needy and
since they are dependent because they are old, the State will
guarantee them whatever they need to purchase a subsistence
diet and adequate shelter, according to Texas's judgment in
any case, while at the same time the State has told the
children in Table II that sines their equal need and their
dependence is caused by the death or absence or incapacity
of their father, the State will only help them purchase 50 per­
cent of what the State says they need to survive.
At the outset we wish to make clear for the Court that
the discrimination in the percent of needs paid is not related
to any differences in the requirements of the various
recipients.

As we have mentioned, the percentage reduction is

applied after the standard of need is computed.
Therefore, if there were any differences in needs in
these particular families, for instance economies of scale
because there were more members of the household, or maybe a
blind recipient needs a seeing-eye dog, and of course an AFDC
family normally would not, those would be reflected in the

e
standard of nfesci before the percentage Is applied.
■Secrss dealing with families that Texas has said, aft.
it computes the standard, are equally needy.
As the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
pointed out in a brief in the District Court of Alabama, which
I submitted to this Court, in Whitfield vs, King, the
percentage reduction as applied is essentially a fiscal measure
it is unrelated to the needs of the various recipients.
We also ask the Court to bear in mind that the
percentage reduction in this case has nothing to do with the
availability or non-availability of other sources of income.
When income is actually available to a particular recipient,
whether it be. an OAA recipient or an AFDC recipient — for
example, child support for the ADC mother, social security
benefits for the OAA family — that income is subtracted from
the grant.

There aren't any double benefits we're contending

with here,

so the percentage reduction has nothing to do with,

that.
In fact, the way Texas applies the percentage
reduction to the AFDC family actually operates as a work
disincentive.

Unlike Maryland, in the Dar.dridge vs. Williams

case, involving family maximums, that this Court decided,
*

Texas does not encourage an AFDC recipient to seek non-welfare
sources of income,

since it's impossible for the Texas AFDC

family to use that income to get closer and closer to the

9

Standard of need.

Because the way Texas applies the percentage

reduction is that it applies it to the standard first, and then
it subtracts outside income.

No AFDC family in Texas could ever

end up with more than 50 percent of its needs»
So it does not have that work incentive feature of
the Maryland family maximum, and indeed the Supreme Court of

?
California unanimously decided, in the case of Villa vs» Hall,
which we’ve also supplied to this Court, the Court noted that
this, too, was a work disincentive feature and specifically
referred to the Texas budgetary method, which is similar to
California’s.
It is this aspect of the percentage reduction as
used by Texas which gives rise to our Social Security Act
claim.

And with the Court's indulgence, I'd like to finish

the statement of the case with the facts that gave rise to our
statutory claim and then return to the argument.
Prior to May '89 the family described in Table II,
receiving AFDC, was determined by Texas to need approximately
$165 per month under the Texas standard of need.
Since at that time Texas used that standard to
determine the amount of payment and eligibility for payment,
all four-person families with income less than this amount
received some benefits.

The precise amount depended on whether

or not their budget deficits, their standard of need minus
their available income, exceeded the maximum grant level then

10

in effect i:;- Texas,

If it did, they only received the maximum.

Bff-ac .:ive May 1, 1969, consistent with one of the
mandates of Section 402(a)(23), which is the subject of the
Court’s Rosado decision, Texas adjusted its standard of need by
IX percento

The cost of living increase since that standard

was last priced in 1965.
We are not challenging the adequacy of that adjustment
in this case,
As a result, the family in Table II now is determined
by Texas to need $17 per month more, or now $182 per month»
Additional families, therefore, those with income below this
new standard of 182 but above the pre-May *69 standard of
$165 have now been determined by the State of Texas to be in
need of public . .ssistance.
But on that date Texas stopped using its standard of
need as the AFDC yardstick against which income would be
compared, and it was —
Q

Are you saying that before 1965, when the

standard, I believe, was $165, a family of four received 165?
MR. COLEs

Mo, Is® not, Your Honor.

The family of

four before May 569 received —* when they changed to the new
policy and adjusted the standard — received the full differ­
ence between their standard of need and their available income.
Q ■

That is, if one earned $100 a month, and the

standard of need was 165, they got $65?

11
MR. COLE:

They got $65,- right.

The only limitation

vrns there was a family maximum on grant, which in Texas at that
time was $123.
.

So if their budget deficit was greater than

123, they only received 123.

That was the system that was

upheld in Dandridge vs. Williams.
Q

How, what's the difference, where you said they

would get 65, the-difference between 100 and 165? what's the
situation today where one still earns 100?
MR. COLE:

Okay.

Now the standard has been raised,

the standard n©”* is $182.
Q

Yes.

MR. COLS; But at the time the suit was brought, the
percentage factor was 50 percent.

So let's use that figure.

The 50 percent is multiplied against the 182, which results
in an item which Texas calls "recognizable needs", even though
the standard of need is 182.

And that recognizable need is 91.

The. family with income of 100 now receives no bene­
fits.

Not only does it receive no benefits, but the family,

since it’s net receiving a cash welfare grant, loses complete
Medicaid coverage, because Medicaid in the State of Texas and
in half the States is conditioned on the receipt of public
assistance.
Q

And this change, you say, was made in 1969?

MR. COLE;

It was made May 1, 1969.

And it was the

policy that's now being challenged by the amended complaint in

12
this lawsuit.
By the \va;v; the Medicaid consequences, which I
referred to, are not' minimum.

The Solicitor General has told

the Court that for the average AFDC family it amounts to about
50 to 60 dollars per month.
And why is it, did you.say, they lose those
benefits?
MR. COLEs

Congress has mandated, in Title IS of the

Social Security Act, that Medicaid assistance be provided only
to those persons receiving aid under one of the cash welfare
programs.

And since that person is now — is still needy,

they8re not receiving the dollar grant, then they lose Medicaid
eligibility.
Q

That is, the one who earns the 100, entitled

only to 91, gets nothing?
MR. COLE
Q

%

J

And therefore he also gets no Medicaid?

MR. COLEs
Q

Right.

That’s exactly right.

Whereas back in-- where you have the 100 and

165, where they got 65, they'd also get Medicaid?
MR. COLEs

Yes.

Your Honor, we are not maintaining in this lawsuit
that Texas must pay full needs.

I’d like to make that clear.

Texas could establish any percentage reduction it wishes under
the Rosado decision, as long as it pays some benefits to those

13
families with a need.

That is, if it wants to pay only ten

percent to benefits, but. it applies that to the budget deficit
after it subtracts the income, then the Medicaid consequences
would riot attach, because the family would get some dollar
benefit.
What happened in Texas, beginning May 869, is that
2500 families who were previously receiving APDC became
ineligible by the operation of the new system.
stipulated by the State.

That was

And of course the new families who

were rendered needy by the adjustment to the standard of need,
those marginal income families, were kept off the rolls.
It is this that gives rise to our statutory claim,
since Texas managed to cancel out the one practical effect.
Q

Well now, in my hypothetical family earning 100

now entitled to nothing, it would be better for them, I gather,
simply to quit work and then get the 91 plus Medicaidf is that
it?
MR. COLE:

Yes, sir.

Absolutely.

Or at least only

earn 90, if they could manage that, or only receive 90.
Q

Yes.
t.

MR. COLE: There are other factors other than work.
Fathers deciding whether to support their families.

Every

dollar of support goes to the State treasury as opposed to
helping their family reach this standard of need.
You must remember, the standard of need is what

■14

Tessas defined

- the basic requirement for subsistence living

to families below that standard.
Q

The Medicaid for your family in Table II you

said runs to about 50 to 60 dollars a month?
MR. COLE;

The Solicitor General has told the Court

that the average AFDC family receives 50 to 60 dollars a month
Medicaid.

I don81 think 1 have to belabor the point that

medical care could mean life itself.

And we are dealing,

after all, with families who don't even have enough to supply,
under Texas’s own terms, enough food, clothing, and shelter to
their fami1ies.
Q

Mr, Cole, I believe the respondent in his brief

makes the point that all of the parties appellant presently
in the case have not lost their eligibility as a result of what
you claim to b© Texas’s violation of the statute.

Mrs. Davila

having been dismissed as an appellant in October *69,

What,

is your answer to that contention?
MR. COLE;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, first of all, this

is a class action, and there’s a stipulation that 2500 families
in Texas, eligibility was affected by this.

That's No. 1.

Mrs. Davila was a plaintiff in a consolidated case.
The reason she did not appear, was not available te­
rn©, I don’t know the reason; it’s perhaps because the Jefferson
plaintiffs appealed and she thought, she was protected.
But, more important than that, one of the appellants

15
that is before the Court, Mr. Vasques, is presently earning
income# he was not when the complaint was filed.
receiving some disability benefits.

He is now

Now, while they weren't

enough to defeat his eligibility, the matter of computing the
payments affects: him seriously, because if the percentage were
applied after his income is subtracted, he would receive a much
higher grant.
It's our contention that Mr. Vasques, even if you
don't want to consider the unnamed members of the class who are
not before the Court now, that Mr. Vasques has an interest in
the computation method, and he's raising the eligibility
consequences, since, if the Court agrees with us on that point,
we'll have to strike the Texas method and he will get an
increased grant as a result.
Q

^ So you say his interest is sufficient to enable

you to raise the point?
MR. COLE:

Yes, sir.

I'd like to conclude on this factual statement by
pointing out that this effect of making these additional needy
families eligible was precisely what Mr. Justice Harlan referred
to in the Rosado opinion as the one practical effect of the
statute under which we're litigating, to make these marginal
needy families eligible for the care and training provisions
of the Act.
With respect to our equal protection claim, our

16
position is that the District Court incorrectly- measured the
discrimination against AFDC recipients according to the tradi­
tionally lenient equal protection test.
Frankly, we believe that the treatment of AFDC
recipients is a basic purpose to it.

,

In light of the enormous racial imbalance and the
various local categories, a long history of restrictive measures
against AFDC recipients in Texas, which have borne most heavily
on blacks in the program, the State's decision to allocate funds
as it has leaves little room for any other inference.

This is

particularly so when appellee's own frivolous explanations are
added to the picture.
I'd like to discuss them in a moment.
Our case, however, does not depend on this Court
finding a racial purpose in discrimination.
In Dandridge, the Court said that even if the State
welfare regulation is not drawn on its face in racial terms
but is shown to have a racially discriminatory effect, it will
be inherently suspect and subject to a strict judicial review
by the Court.
This is just such a case.
I'd first like to set out very briefly the report of
the racial impact of what Texas has done, and then review the
explanations put forth and the hugs disparities.
Of a total of 389,000 welfare recipients in the

1?
State, 46 percent of them are white, 54 percent of them are
black or Mexican-American.

In comparison, the racial and ethnic

distribution within each category is striking.

In AFDC it's

not 54 percent black or Mexican-American, it's 87 percent black
and Mexiean-American.
Q

The old age program is —

Divided how?

MS, COLEs

I'll have to refer to the record, Your

Honor,
Q

Well, just — I don't care exactly, but are

they about half and half, or —
ME. COLE;
record.

I have it right here, at page 72 of the

The AFDC program is — yes, it's about 45, 44.6 percent

black, 40 percent Mexican, of the 85 or 86 percent, yes.

So it

would be blacks and Mexicans are evenly divided, yes, sir.
Q

Thank you.

MR. COLE;

The OiXA program is not a majority black

or Mexican, as we might have expected, but it's 63 percent
white.
in setting its payment levels, Texas has selected the
one classification that enables the most whites to be benefitted
by the State's allocation, while, at the same time, the
greatest number of blacks and Mexicans are disadvantaged.
Q

Are there other States that have followed this

Texas pattern?
MR. COLE:

Yes, sir.

In the Appendix to our brief,

18
we- have set forth two chartos

one as of October *70, which is

the latest published information we had from the Department of
Health, -Education, and Welfare,, we list about 20 States that
have the percentage disparity.
In Appendix B we have selected those States wherethe disparity is the greatest, Texas was 25 percent as of today,
Q

What page is this?

MR, COLEs

lb of our brief? it's the very last page

of the brief.
And if you®11 notice, of those seven States whose
percentage disparity is as great as Texas's, five of those States
present a racial disparity very similar to Texas.
With this racial impact in mind, we ask the Court to
consider Texas's justification for selecting the AFDC recipients
to bear the sole brunt of the State's fiscal limitations.

We

think the justifications are so rational that the Court could
decide this case in our favor using the traditional test.
There are three sets of explanations.
practical one in the record.

There's a

There's a lawyer's justification?

and the one the District Court used.
The practical justification is this:

the three-

judge court below asked counsel whether there was anything
in the record that would support this discrimination.

The

Attorney General's response was, and I quote from page 71
of the oral arguments

We've got just so much money in each of

19
these programs to spend*
Well, this is undoubtedly true.

But what we3re

challenging here is the legislature’s allocation to minors.
Mowj, that, becjs the question before the Court. Slid we remind
the Court that since 1965 the Texas Constitution has given the
Legislature complete flexibility in appropriations? it has only
a total ceiling,
Q

Well, are you suggesting that if they wanted to

spend no more than they now spend, they can level out the
percentage for all four categories, say at 60 percent?
MR. COLE?

Yes, sir? and 1 don’t think it would have

to be at 60 percent,
Q

Well, whatever it may turn out to be.

MR. COLE? The reason 1 say that, Your Honor, is
because there are twice as many Old Age recipients as &.FDC
recipients.
Q

There's —
But I gather your premise is it would not be

100 percent across the board, but would be something less than
that,
MR. COLE:

Unless the Texas Constitution were amended,

it would, not be 100 percent across the board.
But they do have that flexibility.
didn't.

Before 565 they

The Texas Constitution said a certain limited amount

for ADC and a certain limited amount for Old Age Assistance.
That is no longer the case.

20
Q

Mr. Cole, you’re not challenging on Federal

constitutional grounds the over-all Texas ceiling?
MR. COLE:
Q

No, sir.

Then,, if you prevail, basically the AFDC people

will get more out of a common fund, and the other categorical
grants would get less? is that right?
MR. COLE:

If the Texas Constitution stays as it is,

that would be the result, yes.
Q

You’re not challenging the Texas Constitution?

MR. COLE:

No.

But, frankly, Your Honor,

we do

believe this is not a legal judgment to ba made either by us or
the Court: that if that question is put to the Texas people,
the constitutional ceiling would be raised.
Q

1 take it

MR. COLE:

But it's true that if we win we’re not.

requiring the State to spend more money, it will be a realloca­
tion .
Q

1 take it from the stipulations on file that

this would result in a lowering ofthe benefits received from the
categorical — in the other categorical grants, the Old Age
Assistance, blind assistance?
MR. COLE:

Right.

The stipulations make clear that

Texas is fully spending its appropriations in the ether
categories, and that the money will have to come from some­
where.

21
Q

And that no effort was made f either by tbs

respondent or by you, to join any representative members of
these other classes who would suffer if your contention pre­
vails?
MR. COLE:
Q

We did not; no.

Do you have any position as to whether under

Rule 19 they should have been joined?
MR. COLE:

Your Honor, my position would be that

they stand in the same position as the favored class in almost
every equal protection ease that’s before the Court.
I think the thing that's troubling you is that we're
dealing here with a pot of money,, not eligibility for public
housing or regulation of business? but it's always true that
the favored class stands to lose its favored treatment if the
disfavored class wins the lawsuit.
And under Rule L9 I don't think this Court has everrequired the disfavored class to be brought before the Court.
Q

However, in this case you have all the aspects

of a common fund, it seems to me, a limited amount of money
that you haven't had in some of those other cases,
ME. COLE:

I suppose that's right, to the extent

that the Texas Constitution limits the amount — the present
Texas Constitution limits the total expenditure.

X would say

this, Your Honor, that the suit obviously had widespread
precedents, the State of Texas was well known in the State of

22
Tescas, and 1 think it would be wrong to say that the suit would
come as a surprise if the appellants before this Court should
win, would come as a surprise to the Old Age Assistance in the
State.
Q

Well, how can you say that?

This is a group

scattered widely over Texas, not represented by anyone, so far
as we are informed on this record.
MR. COLE:

Your Honor, that is really one of the

points that goes to the heart of why Texas has done what they've
dene.

Twenty-five percent of all the people over 55 in the

State of Texas receive Old Age Assistance.

That3s an astounding

figure.
The appellants have testified quite candidly that it
was their political class that has basically encouraged the
Legislature to appropriate as it has.

Mr. Bond, the chairman

of Public Welfare, testified that OAA touches nearly every
home; AFDC doesn't touch as many people.

And the OAA people

have the vote.
How, 1 would think the Legislature has been responsive
to them, and they must have some input into the process.

I

point out that the AFDC children represent less than 3 percent
of the State's population of children under 18, compared to
the OAA percentage.
X really have no other response to the fact that
they have not bean brought before the Court.

23
I will point out that the State of Texas never made
an motion to bring them before the Court., either.

For whatever

.that's worth.
18 d like to point out that the record shows that the
welfare officials would equalise if the Legislature appropriated
a lump sum.

Mr. Bond's deposition again indicated that.

But there's no welfare-related reason for this. The
welfare expert says:
would do.

If you give me a lump sum, that's what T

I!d have a percentage across the board.
But they haven't given him a lump sum, even though

the Constitution permits it.
The lawyer's justification was that the discrimination,
is justified because AFDC children and mothers, while today
unemployable f are more likely to become employable in the
future.

And also because they're more likely to gat support

from relatives.
Well, future employability potential obviously has
no bearing on the rationality of current payment disparities.
The welfare pro .-eras are designed to meet current needs, and
maybe that would justify if they were running training programs
for AFDC recipients, but it certainly wouldn't justify
cutting current AFDC grants.
In short, in Texas we suggest that paying BO percent
of needs in OAA would be fair in light of the fact that a
majority of QAA recipients receive social security.

This has

24
nothing to do with the question before the Court.
The District Court viewed the program as completely

separate programs.

Whatever you do in OAA you don't have to do

in AFDC, because they8re separate., because we see an agency
whose purpose is to strengthen family life, and the purpose of
the other program is self care»
The fact is the Texas Constitution and the Texas
statute makes no such distinction»

The purposes are single-

minded financially in rehabilitative services.
Mow, I would suppose that a blind person may need a
different kind of social service than an ADC mother whose
husband just passed away. But 1 would suggest that those
differences don't justify a difference in the financial
assistance you give to the family»
With respect to the statutory claim. Section 402{a)(23)
required each State by July *69 to adjust the amounts used in
that State to determine the family need for AFDC.

And also to

proportionately adjust any maximum that the State may have.
.Before this Court, in Rosado vs. Wyman, the petitioners
argued that the section contemplate an increase in all AFDC
*

payments by July 1969.

They urged that any other construction

would render the statute a meaningless bookkeeping exercise.

Mr. Cole, lot me interrupt you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAT BAILEY* ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. BAILEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think counsel has stated that there are initially
two questions presented in this cases

Your first, a constitu­

tional question involving the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
This is based upon the manner in which the Texas
Legislature has allocated the money available between the
various categories of welfare assistance in Texas:

the aged,

the blind, the totally diabled, and the dependent children.
The statutory claim deals with one of the allocations
of the money between these categories, by the Legislature
violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Also, the further statutory issue of whether the
Texas method of determining eligibility violates the Social
Security Act, and in particular 42 U.S.C., Section 602(a) (23).
Also I think we have in this case an additional issue
other than those raised by the appellants? and that is whether
there is justiciable controversy between the appellants and

26

appellees as to the statutory grounds alleged.
X ':h:'.:.ik that it would help the Court somewhat if we
looked a little into the background of these welfare programs
in TexasThe Texas Constitution prohibits gifts to individuals.
These welfare programs that Texas has have been authorized by
amendments to the Constitution,,'which allows these grants to
be made tc needy individuals.

These amendments have always —

which authorize these grants — have always put a limit upon
how much money the Legislature of Texas could appropriate to
pay these grants.
In fact, up until 1965, they even put a limit on
how much they could appropriate for various ones of the program.
However, in 1965, this was done away with, to where the
Legislature could appropriate different varying sums, as they
saw fit, between the various-categories that, were in operation,
Q

But you say there's a constitutional limitation

on the
m. BAILEY:
Q

Yes, sir.

— on the total now since 1965?

MR. BAILEY:

When this suit began, it was $60

million.
Q

Ye So

MR. BAILEY:

During the course of the litigation,

in fact shortly after the initial judgment was entered, the

21
people of the State raised the ceiling to $80 million.

The

bulk of which went to the AFDC program»
Q

And that's in this State Constitution, that

$00 million?
MR. BAILEYs

Yes, sir.

Now t ~
Q

As a figure; it's not a formula, is it?

It's a

figure of $80 million?
MR. BAILEYs

Yes, it's an actual figure, and it’s

been gradually going up, somewhat stopped at times, and it's —
oh, well, I believe the last attempt before the one that was
passed was defeated. So these have not always passed the vote
of the people.
Q

This is don© by referendum?

MR. BAILEYs
Q

It's just on general election, —

It's a popular vote?

MR. BAILEYs

— the Legislature's constitutional

amendments to the people, and they vote on them, either passing
them or rejecting them.
Q

The majority vote will pass them?

MR. BAILEY:

Yes, sir.

Now, the Legislature in Texas meets only every two
years, except in Special Sessions.

And normally the money is

appropriated on a two-year basis, for a two-year period.

Now,

the constitutional amendments can only be submitted pursuant to

28

a regular session, which means that if we get in a crisis
financialwis© we can’t call a Special Session, submit a
constitutional amendment and get more money.

We’re on sort of

a two-year basis.
Now, Tessas in the late Sixties, and starting really
about 1968, like many of the other States had various regula­
tions dealing with items likes

man in the house, maximum

grants, certain resident requirements.
The court decision that began to come about :?n this
period of time resulted in a dramatic increase in the welfare
rolls, mainly in AFDC, the category that this litigation is
directed at.
Now, the resultant consequence of this was that we
had a constitutionally fixed amount of money to spend, we had
a two-year appropriation to work with.

There was no way to

rapidly amend the State Constitution,or any assurance that the
voters would, to make more money available.

There was no way

— or there is no way to transfer appropriations between these
categories unless the Legislature does it.
The only thing that could happen was that grants in
some of the categories had to be lowered, the ones that the
rolls were raising rapidly in.

We had the added problem at

this time, that the cost-of-living increase required by the
Social Security Act became effective July 1, 569.

Texas, faced

with this problem, went to the solution that some States were

29

using and one that the Department of HEW was authorising, that
of going to a ratable reduction method, where we recognise
this standard”©f-living increase but we can only pay a percentage
of this o
Texas had to reduce some of the grants as. a result
of using this ratable reduction system.

And it was because of

this, either the reduction of some of the individual grants or
the fact that they did not increase, that actually triggered
this lawsuit.
Now, let's initially look at the constitutional claim.
They are complaining that the allocation that the Legislature
of Texas has made between these various categories is in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
It's really a twofold thrust, 1 think, in heres

One,

is that we are not paying the same percentage of need between
the various categories, and they say there should be no
variance.
Now, in the aged program we pay 3.00 percent? as to
the blind and the disabled, 95 percents at the time of this
lawsuit 50 percent in AFDC.
Q

This is about —

Who fixed those percentages?

HE. BAILEYs The Welfare Department, Your Honor, on
the basis that they had to figure how much money they had and
hew much they were going to pay out.
Q

Well, did the Legislature say that AFDC shall

30
have X dollars out of $80 million? Old Age, X dollars out of
$80 million.

Is that the way it was done?

MR. BAILSY: The Legislature did this, and the Welfare
Department, of course, then has to take the money that's in the
program and says
Q

We've got so many people, 24 months —

So that the Legislature said?

million, 40 million shall go to AFDC.

out of the 80

What you're telling us

is, I gather, that they could not pay more than 50 percent of
need and stay within the 40 million?
MR. BAILEY:
Q

Within the budget, yes, Your Honor.

I see„

MR. BAILEY:

Now, this, because of the constitutional

amendment that was passed, raising the 60 million to 80 million,
we have since been able to increase the percentage from 50
percent to 75 percent at the present time, and was shortly
after this suit commenced.
Q

But the others stayed at 100 percent, did they?

MR. BAILEY:

No, sir.

They stayed — the blind and

disabled stayed at 95, and the Old Age Assistance remained at
100.
Q

At 100.

MR. BAILEY; The appellants have also raised the
allegation that this allocation of funds between the categories
has soma form of racial motivation or effect.

Now, as to these

contentions, the court below has twice rejected it.

I think

as. 'to this initial argument that King ~v. Smith and Dandridge v.
Williams hav* already decided this initial issue adversely to

•die appellants„

The Court has recognised in these cases that

the States have considerable latitude in allocating their AF.BC
resources.

2 think, this Court has said that each State is

free to set its own standard of need, and to determine the level

of benefits by the amount of funds it devotes to the program.
I don't believe that the Court could make it much
clearer that the States can use their discretion as to what
particular problem in the welfare area that the State wants to
concentrate upon and use their limited funds to do the best job
they can»
I think the court below recognised this when they saw
that Tessas only had a limited amount of money, and they felt
that it was the duty of the Legislature of the State to use its
judgment in the manner and amount the available money should be
divided.
I think that the court below possibly looked to this
Court’s warning in Dandrldgc v. Williams, where the Court stated
that the Constitution does not empower the Court to second-guess
State officials charged with the difficult responsibility of
allocating limited public welfare funds among the myriad of
potential recipients„
We feel that to do otherwise would really put the
court then in the position of exercise a legislative rather

32
than a judicial function,
I think that without commenting at length upon them,
there are nuauarous reasons which are constitutionally sufficient
for spending less in one program, and let's just look at it,
the AFDC program, as opposed to certain of the other programs.
The courts have long recognised that these are
different programs with different objectives.
Secondly, the aged, the blind, and the disabled are
not likely going to improve their condition? in many cases it
will only worsen.

These people are also quite frequently the

recipients of larger amounts of drugs or medical needs,
I think that this is one that the Legislature could
have considered is wanting to devote more of their energy,
more of the available funds in this area as opposed to another?
not necessarily feeling that the child or the blind or someone
else should suffer, but realising that they couldn't create a
Utopia either, with the money that they have.
Q

You're talking about more of the public funds

fox* the aged or for the blind or for the disabled? in fact, is
that true?

How much of the $80 million goes to AFDC now?
MS, BAILEY:

million.

About 23 million, a little over $23

So it would be somewhere around close to 30 percent

2 would reckon,
C

About 23 million goes to AFDC, —

MR, BAILEY:

«— out of the 80, I believe, in the last

33
app ro p r i at ion.
Q

—* ant1 about how much goes to each of the others

MB. 3AXLEY:
Q

Ah, ~

About, X don't

MR. BAILEYs

X would have to look. Your Honor»

1 believe there is around 50 million goes to the Old

Age .resistance program,
Q

There's not many people involved?

MS, BAILEY:
Q

-?he blind program is rather small.

Yes, sir,

Right,

MR. BAILEYs
but not too much.

And the APTD is also — has risen some,

Although this is rapidly growing.

But the

remainder of the money, about $? million, approximately
remaining is divided between the blind and the disabled.
0

Yes,

And so that 50 million out of the 80 goes

to Old Age-Assistance?
MR. BAILEY:
Q

Yes, sir,

And the fact is, as your brother said, I guess,

that —• what — about 25 percent of everybody over 35 in Texas
gets Old Age Assistance?
MR. BAILEY:

I think this would probably ba correct.

1 haven't ~~
Q

One out of every four people over 63, then.

MR. BAILEY:

Q

New, the —

Mr. Bailey, you've bean making, I guess this is

34
your constitutional —
MR. BAILEYs
Q

Yes, sir»

— that thereJs no constitutional violation*

Are you going to get to the statutory?
ME. BAILEY:
Q

Yes, I am.

Because I gather if this system conflicts with

any requirement of the Federal statute, then it can't stand;
is that correct?
MR. BAILEY:

This is correct, sir, either one of them.

Now, the appellants in this case have also questioned
the use of the traditional equal protection test by the court
below rather than the compelling interest test.

I think that

Pandridgo v. Williams decides the question that unless there is
some showing in the rule or regulation that there's a racial
motivation or effect, that the. compelling interest test should
not come into play unless this is shown.
This, 1 think, brings us both to this question and to
the civil rights question.

The appellants have contended that

this allocation is because of some racial intent.
1 think the undisputed facts in the record before this
Court show that this allegation is without merit, and the
court below has, on two occasions, so held.
look at a little bit of the facts in here.

I think we have to
There's never been

a reduction in AFBC programs.
The amount of increases over the last 28 years have

35
--qvuBl

frcs-i the

idpolst of every time some of the

adult categories were raised in money, so was the AFDC program.
Q

Mow, you cay there * s never been a reduction, in

AFDC, are you talking about on total money appropriated?
MR. BAILEY:
Q

Ye8, sir, in total,

But there has, has there not,

or am I

mistaken — been a reduction in the percentage given to
MR. BAILEY:
Q
need.

To AFDC?

— to units based on percentage of standard of

There has been a reduction in that, hasn't there?
MR, BAILEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

There have been, over

the history of these programs, reductions in practically every
one of them at one time or another.
Q

Yes«.

MR, BAILEY: Either by the Legislature not appropriating

money and the programs growing, there have had to be some
reductions from time to time.
Q

Yes.

MR. BAILEY:
Q

But never in the total amount of money —

Total money, yes.

MR. BAILEY:

-- spent for the programs.

Since 1943, the AFDC program has been growing about
twice as fast as the adult programs.

The majority of the

families receiving actually an increase under this ratable
reduction theory that Tesras went through in *69 were actually

36
large families which war© predominantly Negro and MexicanAmerican.
Under this proposed amendment which was passed, to
increase the money available some $20 million, of the amount
that was appropriated by the Legislature the AFDC got almost
12 million out of the 15 million available.

Also the court,

in looking at the depositions of the Welfare Department
officials, said that these people didn’t even know what the
racial makeup

of the various categories was until after this

suit commenced and they were required to do certain studies
and come up with certain statistics.
Another thing that we get into her®. We talk about
leveling this out.

If we took — and these are stipulations

in this case — if we took this money and leveled it out, it
would not have a racial effect as the appellants seem to
contend.

It would mean that practically an equal amount of

racial groups in the adult programs, the Aid to the Blind and
the Disabled, would have their grants lowered to in turn raise
about the same amount 'to individuals in these ethnic groups in
the AFDC program.
Now, if this was not the case, there might be some
merit to appellants* contention.

But leveling this out has no

racial connotation, because there are going to be as many
people in the Maxican-Anssrican and the Negro that will have
their grants lowered in these other programs, it will have them

37
raisisd in AFBC. And I think this itself shows the. lack of
merit in appellants' contention«
Q

Hr. B&ile-y, you're speaking in terms now of

absolute numbers * are you not, rather than percentages?
MR. BAXLEYS
Q

Yes, sir.

I take it that the appellants' response would

be that, although the absolute numbers might be.the saraa. the
percentages are a good deal different.
MR. BAXLEY;

X have — aits not aware in the record

nor hat^e j really looked to see what the percentage differences
would be.
about

But whan we're talking about people» you5re having

as many

hurt as you are having helped, among the ethnic

groups.
I uhink that Kingf and Dandridge show us that the
States have a lot of latitude in the way they allocate this
money,

We submit, also, that there was no racial motivation

or affect in what has bean done in the allocation.

There are

some four other cases,, the Lempton case out of Louisiana, the
Vferd case in Mississippi, the Goodwin case out of Yaw York,
/

the Stanley case out of Virginia, which all have percentages
about the same, or very strikingly similar.
And to date X am not aware of the Court saying that

this, showed racial effect or motivation.
How, as to the statutory question, the initial attack
in this case was that the ratable reduction, of paying only s.

38

percentage of. fchio reocgai^ed need, was bad.

However, before

this case reached this Court, the issue was resolved by Rosado.
Now, there were no pleadings or proof or allegations in the
trial or on the first appeal about anything that Texas was
doing wrong in its method of determining eligibility.

It was

only after the Court, this Court, sent the case back for the
entry of a new judgment ..nd after the Court had entered a
judgment denying both the constitutional and statutory ruling
sought by the appellants that they raised, for the first time,
the question of whether or not Texas was properly determining
eligibility.
There were no amended pleadings or efforts to amend
their pleadings.

None of the appellants before this Court

were affected by the way eligibility was determined.

The only

party which could have been affected was the party Davila,
but she didn't even appeal .from the first judgment entered by
the court, and was no longer a party to the case when it was
sent back for the entry of a new judgment, or when this
issue as to determining eligibility was first raised in a motion
to amend the judgment entered by the court.
Q

Now, what’s the respect in which it suggested

that eligibility has not been determined as required by the
Federal statute?
MR. BAILEY: Well, Your Honor, we feel that none of
these people in this case —

39

Q

No.

shat do you understand the appellants to say

it: ths defect; in the dv t 3

in at ion

of eligibility, in light

of the Federal requirement?
MR. BAILEYs

All that I can understand by what they

hnve said here# Your Honor, is that•the possibility that some
day in the future this person might become ineligible.
shows no controversy.

This

The only thing that I believe counsel

said is that if the Court could let this .issue get in here# this
person night have a —
Q

But does it possibly relate to the ineligibility

for Medicaid by reason of the operation of the new
Constitution?
MR. BAILEYs

None of these particular appellants#

Your Honor, are ineligible for any of the medical assistance
programs in Texas.
And this is the issue that we*ve raised hare, is that
we feel that none of these people have been, in any way,
affected.
Q

Well, how about the class?

I gather the

suggestion is that —
.MR, BAILEYs

None of them, none of the class, Your

Honor, that they represent has been affected.

And I think that

counsel and the appellants are in a most unusual position here.
They are arguing ;£or a position which, if granted by this
Court, will

actually lower their benefits.

40
Nowr this is & most strange position, X think, for
the appellants to be in, because if a great many more people
were put on the welfare rolls in Texas, these particular
appellants would have to have their benefits reduced; and X
think this is a somewhat unique situation for the appellants
to coma into court arguing.
0

You mean the actual dollar amount would be

reduced?
MR. BAILEY?
Q

Yes, sir.

As a result of —

Not the percentages, but the dollar amount?

MR. BAILEYs Their dollar amounts would have to go
down, because if we have more people on the rolls, we're
going to have the same amount of money, it's going to have to
go further; so every one that’s an appellant in this case
would have their grants —
Q

But, still, 1 gather, they’d be getting percent­

agewise, if they prevailed, the same percentage as the other
categories of need?
MR. BAILEYs

This might be true, Your Honor, but I

think we come back again to the fact that there’s really no
controversy as to this issue between the parties before this
Court.

What they're really doing is thiss

They've lost their

■lorado caused them to lose their statutory issue on this
ratable reduction, and the only thing they've got left now,
that they’ve tried to jump in at the last minute here on, is

thus foot that aus — the way -at, . determining' -eligibility is
B^fmrt’Xixig that aas navat in the ease until the second judgment
was -entered*
Q

They've get an issue —
But do you understand the appellants9 statutory

claim to foe. limited to a claim that eligibility determinations
-aontravene the eligibility determination requirements under
Federal law?
MR. BJiXLEYs

Yes# sir.

What they're saying in here

is that what Te us does,, they apply this ratable reduction
factor to the standard of need.
share's $100 worth of need.

Let'8 just say it's 75 and

It would be $75» for a particular

individual.
If they have income of more than $75, then they’re,
ineligible.
What the appellants would like to have happen here
would, foe for their eligibility to be determined on the full
recognised need.

This 'would in turn put them showing a small

amount of unrafc need.

This would then put them on the welfare

rolls at a small grant# opening up certain other benefits.
Q

Opening up Medicaid particularly?

MR. BAILEYs

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, I. think that one of the problems that we run
Into here when wo do this.is that we are letting# or putting
on the welfare rolls certain people who are very marginally
igib!<

But the result is that we5.to

having to penalize the people who need the help the most,
because it’s the people that have no outside income, who have
larger needs, that are going to ultimately have to have their
grant reduced to put these marginally needy people on the rolls.
Now, 7 do not. think that it was the intent of
Congress in this Act to penalize the most needy.
Q

Mr. Bailey, on the case or controversy point, I

understood Mr. Cole to say that appellant Vasques was
sufficiently affected by the eligibility determination so as
to enable them to properly raise that with the actual parties
they had before this Court.
MR. BAILEY:

1 don’t see how, Your Honor, because he

is receiving a welfare grant, and he is receiving medical
benefits.

Now, if he was not, if he had been terminated and

no longer could get a grant, could no longer get the medical
assistance, then I think, Your Honor, they would have a proper
party before this Court; but they don’t have one yet.

They

wanted to change horses here, but they haven't got anybody to
fit the saddle of this new horse that they’ve got.
1 think that, really, that they have tried, the
appellants have tried to read into this portion of the Social
Security Act, that portion requiring this cost-of-living
adjustment, e. whole lot more than Congress ever intended to put
there.
The Court, in Rosado, recognised that the purpose of

43

this was to make the States» recognise that the cost-of-living
increases ;r;h occurred. that the State should adjust to them,
that, in turn, it might prod the States to spend more money
in this area*
But I think that, really, what they're asking here
is that something new be read into this, that the eligibility
requirements be changed, the way the States determine eligibility,
And I think that if Congress had intended this to be the
purpose, they would have written in a whole lot clearer than
this and not lefv it up to a hope that some litigant might
discover this hidden among this statute, that this was the
purpose of it.
I think that, in conclusion, that the question of
whether to help the more are the cost of the many really —
and this is the argument that they are making in this case —
is the business of the Legislative Branch not the Judicial.
I think that the arguments and hopes of the appellants in this
case are ones that should be pursued in the Legislative and
Congressional Halls rather than in the courts.
1 think that really what they would like to do is,
when you strip all the argument and the rhetoric and the cliches
that are used, is that they would really like the Court, this
Court, to judge the wisdom and the propriety of the way the
Legislature of Texas has decided it would spend the money it
had available in the welfare area, and turn these appellants*

44
di s z at i sf act ion with this plan,, and possibly if they can get the
Conzt to agree with tv km, into some form of constitutional or
statutory prohibition„
'£ think that the path of this Court is clear, and
that is to sustain the judgment of the court below.
MR, CHIEF JY’SvfCE BURGERs Thank you, Mr, Bailey.
Mr. Cole, you have one minute left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF' STEVEN J. COLE, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. COLE:

Your Honor, first of all, I would like to

remind the Court that there are 2500 families that Teras has
stipulated whose eligibility has been terminated as a result
of the method used here.
Secondly, Mr. • Valques,,

>

whose eligibility has

not been terminated, has lost approximately $40 a month by the
method of computation which, if stricken- because of its
eligibility consequences? he would gain $40 per month.
In Rosado, the Court said, at page 413, that 402(a)(23)
has the effect of requiring the States to recognise and accept
the responsibility for those additional individuals whose
income falls short ok the standard need as computed in light of
economic realities, and to place them amongst those eligible
for the cate and training provisions of the Act.
The Court said this because HEW came to the court and
told the court that1s what 402(a) (23) meant*

And if you will

trot at the amicus foriae a

the Solicitor GaaaraX in Rosado,

yea will find those words«

the Solicitor General in this ease

says that, s

yes, the Court said it, but that was dictum, and

you didn91 really mean to say it.
And I. think if the Court looks at the basis of the
deed aion in the Her York case in widening out New York's
program, you will realize that it wasn’t dictum at all.
Thank you.
Q

Mr. Cole ~-

MR. COX'Ss
Q

Yes, sir.

—* can X ask you one, hopefully final question

about something Mr. Bailey raised,

At least a couple of

your clients here, Mrs. Jefferson, Mrs. Gipson,, are presently

eligible under this Texas standard, and, as I understand his
contention, you’re arguing that these eligibility standards
should b

■ . ■ >adened in such a way that Store people would become

eligible for what is a fixed amount of money, and therefore
that these particular clients of yours would not gain but lose
financially, if your contention is sustained.

What’s your

response to -chat?
MR, CJv*jEs

There are competing interests amongst the

c lass which was,, when the suit was brought, to find all AFDC
recipients in the State.

The original contention in the suit

were indeed that payment had to increase for everybody.
was rejected in Rosado<

That

Or coursef when payments had to inerea

40
so did eligibility, that flowed with it.
On remand, when the p aym a n t s - in c re a s e q ue s t i on was
no longer a viable question, because of Rosado, there was di
verging of claims, X suppose, and this —
Q

No thought was given to getting separate

counsel?
MR. COLE;

Your Honor, X can't -- X personally can't

respond to that, because 1 was not at the District Court level
in this ease.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, Mr. Cole.
Thank yon, Mr. Bailey.
The ease is submitted.
