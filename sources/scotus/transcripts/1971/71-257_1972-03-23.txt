OEM, ARGUMENT OF BILL ui ■■;.>• EfELXUS, ESQ. *
ON SEHAIiF OF TEE PETITIONER
MR. CORNELIUS.:

Thank you* Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice * and may it please the Court:
This case involves a judgment cancelling a note and
tor $20,000 damages recovered on the merits by the petitioner
HE R, Grubbs in the United Statas District Court against
General Electric Credit Corporation* after the case had been
removed from the United States court — from State court, by
the United States Government* which was a party throughout
the proceeding,
The Court of Appeals held that the case was improperly
removed and ordered that it be remanded to the State court»
We* or certiorari* are asking this honorable Court
to reverse the ruling of the Court of Appeals and sustain the
jurisdiction of the United States District Court* which rendered
judgment on the merits.
The ceso arose in this mannerz

It was originally

filed by General Electric Credit Corporation in State Court
rgainot T. IE Grubbs* who is & small businessman in Jefferson,

Texas„
The case was filed on simple note, to collect a
promissory note..

When the case was filed in the State Court

the petitioner, Grubbs, answered on the merits, claiming the.
invalidity of the promissory note and also filed, a cross­
action against General Electric Credit Corporation and the
General Electric Company, alleging that these two companies
had conspired together in an unlawful attempt, which was
successful, to destroy his business by tortious and wrongful
conduct in violation of both the State and the Federal anti­
trust laws.
The petitioner Grubbs then amended 'his pleadings
and brought in the United States Government, in order to
determine the priority of various liens being claimed against
the petitioner by the government and other parties.
When tha government was brought into the case in the
State Court, it filed a petition, for removal, end the case
was removed without objection or without motion to remand on
tha part of any party.
In the United States Court, after removal, the
United State Government filed an answer claiming that its lien
v at indeed prior to the other liens being asserted against Mr.
Grubbs, and the government also filed a cross-action against
General Electric•Credit Corporation and the General Electric
rompsny; alleging that they had conspired together to injure

5

and destroy fhs petitioner Grubbs1 business* snd thereby had
torfcicmsiy ir.terbsr-^i not only with the petitioner' s business
but with the interest of the government? its lien which it had
on the assets of Grubbs»
Me party objected to removal.
0

Mr, Cornelius, was your pleading against the

United States proper under the Texas law of pleading?

Was that

a permissible type of claim to assert, in the case that
General Electric; had originally asserted against Grubbs?
MR. CORNELIUS:
G

Yes, Your Honor, we believe it was.

May antitrust claims be tried in State Courts?

No, Your Honor»

But at the time w®

Court could not construe the federal antitrust laws but could
enforce them concurrently with the federal courts.
We later discovered that that was incorrect.

On General Electric Company,' yes,

Your Honor,
Is the United States here at this time?
MR. CORNELIUS;

No, Your Honor.

You see, after judgment on the merits in the trial
court# there was only left petitioner Grubbs and GECC.
GECC appealed to the Court of Appeals on the meritsi no
question was raised about jurisdiction ? and the Court of Appealsraised the issue on its own motion and requested supplemental
briefs on the creation of jurisdiction.
These were provided# thorough briefs on both sidas.
And the Court of Appeals found a lack of jurisdiction and
ordered remand.
Q

Was pendent jurisdiction argued?

MR. CORNELIUS:
Q

X beg your pardon?

Was pendent jurisdiction argued in those

supplemental briefs?
MR. CORNELIUS:

Yes# it was, Your Honor? very

thoroughly argued in the supplemental briefs# and is also
covered in our briefs here in this Court.
We take the position, may it please the Court# that
inasmuch as United States District Court in the case at bar
had the organic power to hear this controversy, in other words
had cognizance of the controversy, for many different reasons#
if was error for the Court of Appeals to remand the case to the

9
State Court, even if we assume that removal was not authorized
And we don't concede that.

We believe that removal was

authorised.
But we believe the issue is moot* and immaterial,
because, whether removal was authorised or not, all parties
consented to trial on the merits by the United States Court.,
and appeal to th-t court for relief and for a determination of
the entire controversy,
Q

But that wouldn't necessarily invoke you unless

there were jurisdictions placed in the United States District
Court,

Your position is that it. wasn't properly removed,

there was, as you say, organic jurisdiction?
MR. CORNELIUS;
Q

s \

Yes, Your Honor.

But the fact that the parties hadn't contested

jurisdiction over it wouldn't help you if there was no
j urisdiction?
MR. CORNELIUSs

Not if there was a lack of

jurisdiction, that is correct, Mr. Justice Relinquish.
But if there is jurisdiction, then the defects or
!

even the unauthorized removal, we submit, can be waived.
Q

And what's the head of federal jurisdiction you

say there was?
MR. CORNELIUSs
Q

T’hat was the head of federal jurisdiction that

Q

Yes.

MR. CORNELIUS;

On several grounds, Your Honor, and

I*m going to get to those in just a moment.
First of all, because of diversity of citisenship;
secondly, because of the presence of the United States anti­
trust laws; thirdly, because of the presence of the United
States Government as a party.
Q

And the presence of the United States as a

party would foe what?

What jurisdiction is that?

MR, CORNELIUS;

that the presence of the United States as a party gives the

argument before the Court of Appeals, Mr. Justice Douglas.
Wa fate the position, may it please the Court, that
the cases:': by this honorable Court, of Baggs vs. Martin,
McKay vs. Pint a Development Company, In re Albert Moore,
Kraigh vm. Wsstlnghouss, Church, Kerr & Company, as wall as

many other cases, sustain our point.
Q

Mr. Cornelius, on the face of the opinion of the

Court of Appeals, at the outset is a statement that they
find a complete absence of federal jurisdiction.

Xn the

argument to the Court of Appeals, was there any reference to
fcha first paragraph of General Electric8s complaint, which
recites diversity facts, even though they are not directed at
a diversity claim?
MR. CORNELIUS:

Mo, Your Honor, if was never mentioned.

It was never anticipated, by any of the parties, until we
received a letter from the Court of Appeals raising the
question sua sponte.

Q

How, assuming that there was no diversity,

either alleged, as there was in paragraph one, or no diversity
of citizenship in fact, as soon as the United States was
brought into the case, didn't that give a basis for federal
jurisdiction?

DIG the court discuss that in the oral argument

at all?
MR. CORNELIUS:

It certainly does.

In our opinion,

13
Mra Chief Justice, —
Q

Wz3 it argued to the court?

MR. CORNELIUS:

It was argued in the supplemental

briefs, vociferously and enthusiastically.

The Court of

Appeals, in its.opinion
Q

Well, how could you go by the argument, the

main .argument, without some reference to this diversity and
some reference to the fact that the United States had become
a party?

MS. CORNELIUSt

1 think It was touched on, Your Honor,

in the argument before the Court of Appeals.

But most of the

time was spent on a discussion of the merits.
Q

Sir; the Court of Appeals said it was a frivolous

claim against the United States, sort of a trumped-up claim,
or that was its opinion.
MR. CORNELIUSs

More or less, Mr. Justice White?

yes, sir.
Q

And that it was not — so it was so baseless

that it wouldn't independently support removal?
MR. CORNELIUS:

Yes, sir.

But the Court of Appeals

said there was no allegation of diversity or federal question,
and we repeatedly called the existence of these matters to
the court's attention and briefed them extensively in the
supplemental briefs.
Q

vMi federal question .here is just in your answer

14

to the plaintiff’s complaint, that that wouldn't afford it
independent ox tha ixiarxl jurisdiction, would it?
MR. CORNELIUSs

Ordinarily, no, Mr, Justice Relinquish,

but in our case it was a cross-action and therefore a new
action against the General Electric Company.

And so .it was not

an answer, it was a plaintiff's complaint as against General
Electric Company, and raised a federal question„
Additionally, when the government got in, they crossactioned against both GE and GECC, raising the same federal
questions.
Q

And would you defend the jurisdiction over

your client as against General Electric Credit Company as
being pandent jurisdiction in that, situation*?
MR. CORNELIUS 2

We would claim that the court had

pendent jurisdiction of the entire controversy, Your Honor,
under the circumstances, because very similar situations have
beanaffirmed on that point in some cases cited in our brief.
But, you see, the federal court here had jurisdic­
tion because of diversity, federal question, presence of the
government as a party.
Q

Well, supposing the government has pleaded on

something, an interpleader
the federal interpleader

theory that can't be sustained ia
law; that it isn't really a claim to

a limited fund, but i.h?s just a question of lien priority.
MR. ■■'ORUELlUSs

Yes, sir.

district judge confronts that as
soon as the cass in resaovsd and decides there just isn't a
colorful claim'against the United States.

Would that support

federal jurisdiction if the whole balance of the action didn't
involve the United States?
MRa GC'&fiELWS-s

There is some difference of opinion

on that point, Y:>ur Honor, but in my opinion it wotid.
Because Section 3410 gives parties the right to sue- the
Uni.fed Stater Government in State Court in order tc determine

liens,

property or fee lien of the government.

MR. CORNELIUS:

Yes, Your Honor, and they did in

this case♦

?Jr. Cornelius, I suppose that if one were a

purist, the pleading doesn't support diversity jurisdiction,

You responded to someone’s question a few

minutas ago that there was no objection when it was removed,
and there are cases holding that that8s an effective waiver,

MR. CORNELIUSs

Yes, Your Honor.

Very definitely*

U’fco esses of Gordon vs. Third National Bank of

Chattanooga, £jm Printing Comp any vs

an d Killam vs.

if diversity is shown by the record, anyway, in any form, it
is sufficient.

And they also hold that, Mr. Justice Bl&ckmun,

if residence is referred to, that that at least shifts the
burden on the opposite party to show that there is a
distinction between residence and citizenship, for 'the purpose
of showing diversity by the record.
Q

Well, that isn’t true in all circuits, but X

think there isn’t any great controversy here, anyway.
MR. CORNELIUS:

No, Your Honor.

Xn fact, the

respondent here concedes diversity, but we feel that the
respondent here has confused right of removal with organic
jurisdiction.

And there doesn't seem to be any question in

our minds that because the federal court had the organic power
to hear this controversy from several different standpoints,

into dispute a question of whether SECC had the richt to

to foreclose and take title to property on which it and the

Texas law,
MR. CCSHELIUS s

Mr. Justice Marshall, under Texas

law you have a lien which can be created by the chattel
mortgage, and then if you-recover judgment on the debt, you
get a judgment lien.

But it*e different from the chattel

mortgage lien, which both the government and GEGC were
claiming on the property involved here.
Then we say, may it please the Court, that the
fact that the United States Government was a party here,
itself, certainly gave the federal court cognisance of the
controversy.

&r.:d it is our opinion that it gave the federal

government the right to remove, whether it brought itself
under 24.10 or not*
Because'the Constitution says that the judicial
power of the United States shall ©«tend to cases in wh:? eh the
government is a party.

We submit that the decisions hold

that this is true, whether the government is a plaintiff or
a defendant.

statements that were made by Mr» Cornelius in the case

a rUdnly be \:hv. firth to agree that when we received the

I'll

20

letter from the Clerk of the Court, which X'v© attached as an
apos-adii?: to my brief for the re «ponder?, t, wars the first time
it had occurred to any of us that we ware in the position of
having perhaps foisted on the federal court jurisdiction that
it didn't have.
Xn the trial court X worked closely with GE counsel,
who is a Dallas counsel, as I am from Dallas, and when the
government was made a party, it wasrather pussling and
enigmatic to me, because GECC did not have a judgment at that
time, it was not involved in the competition as to whose lien
if any was at stake? it was not even a party in that one
involving the stakeholder phase,
1 couldn't really quit® understand what it was
about, it was just an offshoot of the case. They got
worried and they removed.
Q

Itr. Johnson, let me ask you this;

Let's

assume that the complaint, however Inartfully, asserted some­
thing like diversity jurisdiction, but failed, as Justice
Blackmun said, to state it as it should be stated.

And then

let*s assume that the claim against the United States is a
spurious claim, and that, there is no bona fide basis for their
being made a party.

But after that, when the case was removed,

with no objection from anyone, and that is against the background
of the complaint which alleges facts which would support the
diversity determination, how did the courts say that there —

21

how did they arrive
MR. .TCHNSOS?

Meli, I direct your attention ico the

question that.the court ashed,'arid the court -asked ns?5> and wa
answered it2 and we tried to go on into the rest of it.

Q

what page are you. or*?

MR, iCBNSQR?

I *ra ta?.king about, Appendix B. to my

brief»
The reason I put it in there is I don * t believe it
appears at, any place in the record.
The court says:

"It has come to the Court's

attention that the District Court's removal jurisdiction has
been predicated on 28 U.S.C.A. 2410 and 1444”,, which is kind
of a procedural reference to 2410.

"Having considered the

record and the pleadings, 'the Court has serious questions
concerning the applicability of these statutes.**

tod it
t

"may consider it sua sponte", which I needed to look up at■
the momentf but I soon found out that it meant we had to engage
in a new field.
nIf the case was improperly removed to the federal
court under 2410 and 1444, could it have been removed under
any other federal statute?"
And 2 think the answer to that question had to be no.
General Electric Credit Corporation made the decision as to
what forum it would enter when it filed its lawsuit.

It sued

a Texas resident in the Texas court, where the Texas resident

22
It could have elected to go is* and file a, federal
court suit.

It did notj it filed a simple suit on a simple

matter in a little town down near Marshall, Texas» with a
Marshall attorney,

1 was not the attorney until this antitrust

thing got into it.
Q

And that, suit was not removable by that particu­

lar defendant?
MR. JOHNSON:

Not by that particular defendant.

That was a resident defendant, and the right of removal is
given to the non-resident.

You can check the right of removal

under that statute, and if there's anything to it, if we had
a choice to go to the federal court, we didn't make it.

And

not having made it, there's really not anything we can do to
ever gat back in that posture again.
Q

MR. JOHNSONs Well, the defendant was a resident.

That's what I mean.

In connection with this very transaction.

MR. JOHNSON;

Q

Yes, but I do believe that —

You can’t really say, can you, that the United

States abandoned it?

I gather they litigated on the merits

of their claim —
MR, JOHNSON; Well, —

Q

' end they lost and decided not to appeal.

MR. JOHHoOH s

Hot to appeal.

But. if the bench

fait that the Circuit Court of Appeals was looking at it,
the government had been denied even the right as to its lien
claim, and yet the district court said they couldn't pass on
that.

And that was what it "was brought there for.
Q

Wall, at the time the United States removed

it, wasn’t it a proper move?
MR. JCGHSOHs

Hot enough to fit 2410.

Because there

was no assertion by a lien on any specific property.

There

was no assertion on the basis of it being in the nature of
an interpleader.

There was no interpleader aspect to it.

The amended answer, a cross-action, and they brought
in a third-partj defendant, the U. S. Government; admitted
that it owned all the judgments.

There was no case of

multiple — single liability among multiple claims.

And

the interpleader’s statement was not, was completely demolished
in the pleading itself, it would appear,
I must confess we assume that

1 assumed then, and
#

1 did not know until 1 got into it later, that it was that
the government could always remove.

Just because they were a

party.
Well, 1 don’t think I found any support for that in
the subsequent decisions.
I saw a case that came all the way up to this Court,
,; r. re both parties filed briefs saying that the federal court

25
had removal jurisdiction, end this Court saying:

You can’t

get there this way,
Q

e>jw

about 24X0?

Do you say that the action

brought in the State Court against the United States did not
meet the standards of Section 2410?
MR., JOHNSON:
Q

1 don’t think it did.

Why not?

MR. JTCJNSONs Well? I think x?.: you will note the
Portion of 24X0 that the government is brought in there is
for interpleader.

Thin is not an action by the government,

but this was by determination of rights on a failure of
protection of what’s multiple liability.

That was the whole

concept of 2410(a)(5), end -<•>
Q

You say (1), {2}, (3), and (4) are out of it,

and you only argue on (5)«
MS. JOHNSON:

1 don't think they have any — I

think the interpleader concept is the only thing that was in™
volved in it.

The federal government was brought into this

case — my pleading, our pleading was a simple suit to recover a
judgment, never was recovered, lone judgment, 'abstracted judg­
ment was filed, no ancillary process, no

if they ever had

a lien on anything we would have abandoned it by a simple debt
suit.

All we could have gotten was a judgment.
And than wa would have had a right to go see if we

could collect it.

36
And that5 s all that we were seeking in the suit.

Like

VieII, we started out in the right court.
in a court that we had the right to be in.

We started

The government

is the one that got us lifted out of our strata, 1 guess.
Q

Of course, Mr. Johnson, you've got to deal with

the argument, too, don't you, that even though it was
improperly removed, if the federal court, at the time of
removal, had what your opposing counsel called organic
jurisdiction, even though it was not removable, if it was
then tried on the merits, it —
MR. JOHNSON;

I'm aware of those eases, and I've

attempted to read those cases, and I have great difficulty
with them, ojid they were cited in their supplemental brief.
*

i think maybe it would help to clarify it, or throw it out,

that the Court of Appeals did not hear oral argument controlling
to the jurisdiction point.

And they wrote the letter, they

called for supplemental briefs directed to the question, and
then the nejsfc thing we get the opinion saying that? Too bad,
you’re in the wrong court.
v

*•

And we’re not accurate in second-gtleesipg, we don’t

know yet what ti o circuit court would have done with our
(inaudible)

•*

they're hr,sod on a State statute of

I licit ac :L on a and hiring?, in attar aspects of Stata law, Texas
law, almost entirely.
That rarhaps might have fcaen one of the reasons that
the court felt that we were trying to maybe conspire or collude
to bring to than a question that they shouldn't have.

But

fcluvk wa3 the furthest thing from our minds and from my mind,
but bsing ashed the question, was ifc properly removed, was
there other grounds of removal? I recally couldn’t find other
grounds of removal*
As yot found out a-while ago, you can't add remov­
ability to a case by what the answer says.
You cculd plead a constitutional question on the
answer, and you dod not get. federal question jurisdiction.
The answer just doesn’t figure in determining removability.
And that's for sure.
Wow, this -~
Q

hr. Johnson, 2 suppose if you had started in

federal courts, you wouldn’t be here today at all?
MR. JOHNSON:

There’s no question that it came up

completely by reason of ■— if we had started in federal court,
V73, as a New York corporation — we don't deny that we1 re a
New York corporation — we're suing a Texas resident, and it
war a suit for ever $10,000.
the federal court.

Q

So we could have brought it in

We didn't.

lour concept today, as perhaps it was originally

is that you wanted your lav-suit tried in the State court?

Mi. JCMiliOMs Weil, I'm in the position where 1 don’t
believe that I have the right to say that I Ml roll over and

play dead, and you can just confer on them jurisdiction»

I

don't — the way I read your cases, I don't think I have the
right to consent to jurisdiction.
Q

Well, don't we have to talk about another

lawsuit, too, namely, Grubbs' suit against General Electric?
Grubbs may not have been able to get this promissory note case
into the federal court, but the judgment against you is on an
antitrust claim, isn't that, right?
MR. JOHNSONt
Q

No, not at all.

What is that for?

MR. JOHNSONs

It's for a tortious interference in

the business, and defamation.
It's business damage from — in connection with the
way they terminated their dealership.
The argument was that this was & plain partnership
action.
Q

Well, in any event, with that lawsuit, he could

have filed in the federal court?
MR. JCONSONt

Ha could have?

No, I don't think he

could have filed it in the federal court, because he was the

resident.

We could have

oh, 1 guess he could have, on a

diversity concept? that's true.

But he simply filed it as a

29

cross-action»
0

That’s the lawsuit in which there's a judgment?

MR. JOHNSON:

That’s correct? that * a correct.

But that is a lawsuit in which —
Q

That's the lawsuit that could have been —

MR. JOHNSON?

That's the lawsuit that he filed himself,

and they brought him her®, didn’t they?
Q

Wall, I understand that.

But it ended up in

federal court, and he could have filed it there originally?
MR. JOHNSON:

Possibly so.

1 think he might have

had a slightly different question —*
Q

Aid that now —

MR. JOHNSON:

— a different point, a distant point

he had to go, I think he might hav$ to go to New York.
Q

Should that judgment of — well, not if you were

in Texas.
MR. JOHNSON:

GECC doesn't operate except in a

sales position d:.wn there.

Maybe under a long arm- we might have

been able to get it there, but X think that *—
Q

boll, X know, but you were already in the State

court as a party -**
MR. JOHNSON s

Q

— and he filed this cross-action —

MR* JO3NSON:
0

But —

Crosa-action•

in which he named the United States and

30
General Electric ? isn’t that right?
MR. JOHNSON:
Q

Yes.

Filed it in the State court.

Filed it in the State court, and then

after that was filed» that was what was pending in the State
court when the United States removed, isn’t it?
,

MR. JOHNSON s
Q

that's correct.

All right.

That5® correct.

So it was pending,, actually, a suit

by the Texas resident against the New York resident, and
that’s the action and the cross-action that was removed,
isn’t it?
MR. JOHNSONs Well, I think you have to — in arriving
at that
Q

No, but that’s —-

MR. JOHNSONs

The word I’m using is to the effect

that the law about not changing the nature of the case by a
cross-action, you're going to have to change some of that law.
If you arrive at that conclusion.
Because this was a responsive cross-action in the
State court, anc it does not change the — it die not make the
case ,removable, as such.

Mr. Grubbs could not have removed

himself, he did not attempt to remove.
Q

There’s one thing he could have done, though,

and that would be to dismiss this State action and start all
over again in federal court.
ME. JOHNSONi Well, he didn’t have to bring — if

wanted to bring his tortious claim,

defalcation suii , he

• 5.,£ not required to bring it, hats not a compulsory counterclaim, he could have brought ii; ... wo're sort of on a debt,
rcc he could, have brought it in whatever fora he wished.

Bu

he did not so do.
Q

One of his claims was an antitrust claim.

MR. JOHNSON?
Q

That's correct.

Under the antitrust law, but —

MR,. JOHNSONs

But it's a little bit mixed up with

State and federal, but 1 think -~
Q

JSbsplicit jurisdiction in the federal courts.

Hit. JOHNSON3
Q

I think that's right.

So here's a case in which he has judgment, it

been tried out i:i the federal court, and the suggestion is
that you start ail over and try it out again in the same
court?
MR. JOHNSON?
is in the matter.

X don't know what the GE's position

I — there having been no appeal by the

at or by them or by anybody else with respect -to
that, they may have some judgment that is —
Q

Well, I know, but •—

MR. JOHNSONi

— that defeats them and can't be

sustained
Q

Grubbs has a judgment.

MR. JOHNSON*

— as a collateral attack.

But you have to agree this result makes law

MR. JGHNSOWs

There’s no question that it brings back

memories of Charles Dickens5 writings, there * s no question about
that.

There’s no question that we

I’m trying to point

out that I thin!- the Court of Appeals was viewing it, I think,
from what we gave them to view it with, and I — there was
no —> I did not expect this question to foe developed in the
case,' when it came up, I couldn’t find a suitable answer.
Perhaps the answer

the. question that was put, of

grounds of removal, made it -- twisted me off a little bit.
But even as X get into it, I do find that soma of the cases
are highly confusing, because all of them seem to have —
for instance, wc« did net — we went to trial on the pleading
that we filed in the State Court.

It’s true we did some

actions in the federal court, but we never amended our
petition ***» we *— the first original petition was the only
petition.

That’s what I suggested in the State court for it.

That's why it doesn't attempt to set any jurisdictional bars
in the federal court.

It was just never amended.

Now, v® did file responsive pleas to each crossaction against ns. We had some in the State Court and in the
federal court, where, for the first time, the United States
Government took interest.

We answered that.

were amended to bring them down to date, because a more
definite statement was subsequently filed.
they

but. it was in the State Court until the

government got into it.

Now, it's just as simple as that.

The government thought it could remove, did remove, we thought
they could remove anc: didn't object,
1 think that the — it's true that the Court of

?
Appeals did not discuss that Baines case, and those cases
that are cited

the Uinta case.

But in each and every one

of those cases, that I could sea, there were considerable
elements of an amended pleading, or sort of a new ballgarns
starting over in the federal court.

They did amend their piesdings twice, or three times, as I
recall

Now, about the judgments which petitioner Grubbs

It is against General Electric Credit

business v?hich resulted in the destruction of his business*
*C3 take the position that these acts are prohibited by the
United States antitrust laws *

The cross-action was brought

And while the court did not conclude that

wa had proven our conspiracy between GE and GBCC, the court
did find and filed an extensive findings of fact and conclusions
cf law indicating that there was suspicious circumstances,
£.:uf indications of e conspiracy between GE and GBCC*
Q
State Court,

The cross-action you refer to was brought in
51 it?

MR* CORNELIUS *

Yes, Your Honor.

.fsf you a ay that the State Court could have

36
tried that on an antitrust theory?
MS.» CORNELIUS:

He, Your Honor.

At the time we

were under the empression that the courts would have had
concurrent jurisdiction of it; but after briefing it more
thoroughly v.;e are of the opinion now that the United States
court had exclusive jurisdiction of federal antitrust.
Q

Well, did you think here your $20,000 judgment

was for violation of the antitrust laws?
MR. CCRNELlUSs

They are for the commission — it is

for the commission of acts which are prohibited by the anti­
trust laws, as we see it, Your Honor.
Q

Well, was your cross-claim under State law

as well as under federal law?
MR. CORNELIUS!
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Under both the —

For malicious injury to your business, is that

what it was?
MR. CORNELIUS!
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Under State law?

MR. CORNELIUSs

Under State law and acting in

concert with General Electric Company, under federal law also.
Q

Aid what the federal district court gave you

judgment, but said that it wasn’t an antitrust claim, didn't
they?
MR. CORNELIUS:
It just said that -

No, Your Honor, it didn’t say that.

Q

Well, it said there wasn’t any conspiracy,

MR. CiRKffiLXUSs

It said that under the evidence he

could not find z. conspiracy between GE and GECC,
Q

If there wasn’t, then could it have been an

antitrust action?
MR. CCSfiELSUSs

X*m of the opinion that it could be,

Your Honor, under the deliberate and malicious acts of the
single parties.
But I may be wrong on that.
Q
the note?

But —

Incidentally, what happened to the action on

Ho c«use of action on that, or what?
MR. CORNELIUS:

The action on the note, Your Honor,

was tried, and the note was cancelled by the trial court,
because of the failure of consideration.

You see, the note

had been given by petitioner Grubbs to General Electric
Credit Corporation on the condition of, and in response to,
certain agreements made by GECC.
The evidence showed, and the court concluded, that
these agreements had been breached, and that therefore the
consideration for the not© had failed and it was void and
it was cancelled by the judgment.
Then, may it please the Court, we would like to
discuss this point:

Do you see any difference in what result

ought to be here?

You've got two different judgments? ail in

Sucmdly, you've got an impairment judgment

of $20,000
MR» CORNELIUS s
Q

Correct.

Mow, you may have been able to get into federal

for that $20,000, either on diversity or by joining it
with another claim, but if GE got started first in the State
to
Court there was 10 way /get that suit on the note out of the
State Court, if you ignored the claim of the United States?
MR. CORNELIUS:

That is exactly right, Ycur Honor.

Becausa we were a resident.
Hovavar, we take the position, and we think the
cases sustain this, that our residence within the State is
merely a venue restriction and is waivable.

In fact, I believe

it was just that kind of a residant situation that's involved
in some of these other cases.
Q

Wall, it's a restriction on removability now,

however?
MR. CORNELIUS:
Q

Yes, it is.

A resident defendant cannot remove,

MR. CORNELIUS:

Yes, sir.

But we believe that that restriction is clearly
waivable,
Q

Lad your other cases say in effect that even

y

40

though improperly removed in a situation like that# if it
goes to trial or the merits, the court doesn’t give waivable
action on jurisdiction*
MR. CORNELIUSs

Right.

And we say we're certainly

not completely lacking in jurisdiction hut had jurisdiction
or the organic power to hear the controversy for five or
six different reasons.
Of course, may it please the Court, we also say that
the action was removable under 2410.

We did not file an

interpleader bill against the government.

We filed an action

under 2410 to determine the priority of the government’s
lion.
This was not a strict interpleader case.

2410 is

not an interpleader statute alone, it involves several
causes of action which can affect the existence or the.
priority of the government's lien.
What specific items of property werrs involved
in this?
MR. CORNELIUSs

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment

in Mr. Grubbs8 business, and multi-thousands of dollars worth
of accounts receivable, all of which had been charged ■»- had
been assigned to the government as security for its rote, that
it had from Mr. Grubbs.

Well, an assignment without Moore, doesn’t

confer a lien on the government?

kn assignment of accounts receivable?

Yes *

Q

Ml at * & what it is,

MR, CORNELIUS?

Under these instruments, we believe

so, yes, Your Honor.
Q

Under Texas law, that would confer a lien on

the property which was the subject of the accounts receivable?
MR. CORNELIUSi

Yes, Your Honor.

You see, they had

a chattel mortgage, to 'begin with, whicn created a lien upon
ail of his property.~ And then this was further secured by
an assignment of the accounts receivable,
Q

It’s a pledge, it has all the earmarks of a

HR. CORNELIUSs & pledge, yes.
Imd then GECC comes in, though, and is collecting
without any authority whatsoever -Was therea delivery of possession in'connection
