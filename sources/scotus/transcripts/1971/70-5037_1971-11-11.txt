Mr. Lawin, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN Z£WXN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF-OP THE PETITIONER
MR. LEWINs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
This case is here on certiorari to the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which, in a short per curiam
opinion, affirmed the District Court's denial of petitioner’s
application for a writ of habeas corpus.
Petitioner is in the Illinois State Penitentiary,
serving a 25-to-50-year term for armed robbery.

Under this

Court’s limited grant of certiorari, two questions are
presented, both interrelated and both relating to the procedure
used under Illinois law by the Illinois ferial court in
admitting a confession made by the petitioner into evidence,
and allowing it to be considered by the jury.
Q

Nov?, just to be sure I have it in focus.

This

i

case presents the i'sue left open in Jackson v. Panne??
MR. LEWINs

It's an issue that the late Mr. Justice

Black adverted to in Jackson v. Senao in his dissenting opinion.
It was left open.

It's one ©f a range, really, of issues, Mr.

Chief Justice, that are left open under Jackson v. Panno,-

4
What it presents is the question of the standard cf
proof that a trial judge must apply when, under a State
procedure, he and he alone determines the voluntariness of a

confession.
Q

Well, does this case also present the question,

or not, whether, after he’s determined voluntariness, whether
that issue is again submitted to the jury?
MR. juEWIN;

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.

If, in fact,

the first question were decided against the petitioner, we
submit, and our contention is that the two are interrelated.
That if, in fact, tills Court were to sustain a standard less
than proof beyond a reasonable doubt for a trial judge making
such a finding, he should constitutionally require that at the
very least the jury get a second look at that issue.
Q

But then, on that, if that were to be so, l

take it, the jury, as in all other issues, would make their
determination by reason of “beyond a reasonable doubt'1 standard?
MR. LBWIN:

That’s right.

We think that’s what would

b© constitutionally required.
Q

Well, do I understand you t© say in effect,

on that point, that the confession, in this context, is like
any other piece of evidences

ones it’s submitted to the jury,

it*a submitted to the jury to be evaluated along with all the
other evidence and by the same standard?

point.

That’s your second

5
MR. LEWXNs

Well, I think our second point is slightly

different from that, because I think it is — Your Honor has
stated the position, I think it does reflect a position similar
to that of the State in this case? what the Stats is arguing is
that once submitted, a confession may only be considered in 'tile
context of all the evidence in fefo© case.
Our contention is that the confession, if admitted,
must still be singled out to th© jury and it must then foe
asked’to decide the question of voluntariness vel non, as
a preliminary fact-finding.
Q

I didn't mean to include that —*• or exclude that

in my hypothetical.

You mean that this would ba a special

instruction in addition to tile general credibility instruction?
MR. LEWINs

Y©s, sir.

W© think that would be constitutionally required if
a judge war© permitted to apply some standard less than proof
beyond a reasonable doubt to his determination.
Q

Would it b@ sufficient for these purposes if,

hypothetically, th© instruction was that:

when you corae to

consider th© confession which had been admitted in evidence,
you will bear in mind that, as with other ©laments, you must
find this voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt?
MR. LEWINs
Q

Yes.

That —

That would be enough?

MR. LEWIN:

That instruction, we think, would fo®

constitutionally sufficient.

Of course it was not given in this

case, and in fact that issue of voluntariness is not in any
way singled out for the jury under the Illinois procedure.
Q

Well, that is an issue that was not left open

in .Jackson v. Denno, I take it?

MR. LEWIS:
Q

No.

No, that was not adverted to

Nov/, wait a minute, wait a minute.

What you’re

in a sens© saying, or what you are saying is that the issu® of
voluntariness must be presented to the jury
MR. LKWIN: Well
Q

—- oven though the jude has passed on it in

advance in a proper manner?
MR. IEWIN:

x

I’m saying that only, Mr. Justice Whits,

if ha is permitted to pass on it by some standard less than
beyond a

reasonable doubt.
In other words, the contention I’m making is that

either -- that* constitutionally someone in .this process must
pass upon voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt.

Either it

may be the judge, and if that’s true the petitioner is
satisfied if he alone makes that decision.
Q

Well, on that basis, —

MR. LEWINs
q

just said:

Or the jury.

So you would be quite satisfied if the judge
X think the voluntariness is — I find it to be

voluntary, it’s admissible.

tod then he says to the jury;

You

7
must find the confession admissible beyond a reasonable doubt?
as a preliminary matter to using it.
MR. LEWINs

You must find it voluntary beyond a

reasonable doubt.

Q

Y.@s«

MR. LEWIN;
Q

Yea.
Yes.

Yes.

You think that would be enough?

MR. LEWIN:

Oh.. I think, for the petitioner's

position, yes,
Q

Well, if that would b® enough ■—

MR. LEWIE?:
Q

— I think that's right.

If that would be enough, why wouldn't it be

enough for the judge to says

There's enough evidence in th©

cm® to find it voluntary? I don't have to pass on it, but I
will give it to the jury and single it out and says

You must

find this voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt?
MR. LEWIN;

That is what Jackson v, Danna foreclosed,

you so®.
Q

I would think it would foreclose —

MR. LEWINs

Q

Right.

— what you're —

MR, LEWIN? We don't have —
Q

If ~~ If th© confession must be found voluntary

beyond a reasonable doubt.
ME, LEWINs

Well, Mr. Justice White, our position ~~

8
the petitioner5s position in this case is that the court need
not go to •— need not reach,, if it decides not. to, the question
whether the judge must necessarily find the confession voluntary
beyond a reasonable doubt.

It would be sufficient if someone

in the process found it voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt.
And the vice of the Illinois procedure is that there
is no one in the entire process who ever passes on voluntariness
beyond a reasonable doubt.

Essentially the State’s argument is

that a confession is like any other evidence — the finding of
voluntariness val non is to a confession, is like a preliminary
fact-finding as to whether a statement is, for example, a
spontaneous utterance so as to be an exception of the hearsay
rule, or whether a certain document is the best evidence under
the best-evidence rule.

And that, therefore the judge end the

judge alone may make that finding.

Ha .makes the finding on the

basis of a preponderance of the evidence, and he then submits
that evidence to the jury for it to be considered ©long with
all other evidence in the case, instructing them only as the
Winship case now requires,, that they must find the defendant
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on all the evidence in the

case.
Petitioner’s contention is, of course, that that .
analogy of confession to any other evidence is plainly
unsound.

The fact that this Court even discussed the question,

much less that it decided it fas it did in Jackson.v. Dan no, is

a plain indication that the question of voluntariness of a
confession, because it involves a possible infringement upon
Fifth Amendment rights, various constitutional dangers lurking
in the background, requires special procedural handling as a
constitutional matter.

Surely it would, not have presented a

constitutional issue, and this Court would not have considered
it if a State, say New York, simply saids Well# that’s a
spontaneous declaration? we don’t allow a judge to make that
preliminary finding# we just have the jury make the preliminary
factual finding.

Or as to any other exception of the hearsay

rule.
If a State had done so, that would present no
constitutional problem.

Since New York did so with regard to

confessions, it. did present the problem considered by this
Court in Jackson# and the ruling of this Court in Jackson that
there must b® a reliable clearcut finding on the issue of
voluntariness vel non.
Now, we submit that it follows from the Jackson
decision, as well as subsequent decisions in related areas by
this Court# that there must be a finding on the issue of
voluntariness at a trial that a confession is voluntary
beyond a reasonable doubt,
Now# of course, the broadest range of that argument
is to say that the judge raust make that finding when he makes
that initial determination required under Jackson v. Penns, ho

xo
must stake it beyond a reasonable doubt.
That issue need not, we submit, be reached in this
case, because in this case, and under the Illinois procedure,
there is no one, no one in the entire process against tbs
defendant, who ever makes that finding beyond a reasonable
doubt.
Consequently, we think that the Illinois practice is
invalid, even under the opinion of the Chief Justice m
Circuit Judge in the D. C. Court of Appeals, which are cited —
the opinions of which are cited in our brief.
In the Clifton case, the Chief'Justice, as Circuit*•
Judge, did say — and we’ve reprinted that as an Appendix to our brief, it appears on page 6d — that it is one thing to
call for the high standard of proof bayend a reasonable doubt
from the ultimate fact-finders, and quite another to ask that,
tiia issue be resolved preliminarily by the judge beyond a
reasonable doubt, contrary to «XI the law governing admissibility

of. evidence*
Q

Mr. Lewin, suppose the evidence — let’s avoid

the word "confession85 for the moment? but suppose a piece of
evidence was offered by the prosecution in the form of a letter
written by the defendant to -some third person, which contained
the essence of a confession.

Would you say that must be *— fall

under this same rule?
ME. LEWINs

Only to the extent, Mr. Chief Justice,

11
that there is soro® constitutional danger,

if the letter had

been seized, in violation of either Fourth or possibly Fifth
Amendment standards
Q

No# just Essmiag that the? recipient turned it

over to the prosecution.
MR. LEWIN:

No.

Where there is no constitutional

problem# where we’r© referring simply to the preliminary
questions# or any — not even preliminary questions# just any
ordinary questions *— question on which — factual issue on
which admissibility depends# then of course it's standard
procedure# and vie don't contend that the constitution requires

otherwise# that the judge maise that factual finding.

Ho aim®

may make it in the absence of the jury# then permit the evidence
to go in# and not comment any 'further on it to the jury# and
not raise those underlying factual issues to the jury at all.
Q

And the jury can accept it or reject it# ae

they se© fit?
MR. LEWIN; As they ses fit# in the context ©f all the
other evidence,
But where the evidence that's ©ought to be introduced
may infringe on. constitutional rights# may in some way have
been unconstitutionally obtained# in those circumstances w*
think that the finding must be made beyond a reasonable doubt.
Now# as to confessions# both under this Court’s
Miranda decision and w© think in Malloy# even prior fco Miranda#

12
it was clear that confessions , admissions made out of court
by a defendant in custody, as was the admission in this case,
are ipso fact©, in and of themselves, declarations obtained or
made by a waiver of a constitutional privilege.

Essentially

any defendant who makes a statement, after he's arrested and
the Court was clear on this in Miranda, and even the dissenting
opinion in Miranda suggested that that was not m imp©rmis&ibX@
reading of old cases' ©r even a permissible extension.
That a defendant who makes a statement -in cits tody is,
in substance, waiving his Fifth Amendment right not to —
Q

I don't understand that.

MR. LENIN:
Q

Hell, —

The Fifth Amendment right is the right of his

compulsory self“incrimination *
MR. LEWINs

hnd a defendant in custody, at least

under — certainly under Miranda, and there I think the Court
went into substantial —
Q

In what part ©f Miranda?

MS. LEWIS): Well, l think, in Miranda of course the
Court relied on Bram and prior cases.

I think Mr. Justice

Harlan as well adverted to the fact that saying that the Fifth
Amendment applies to custodial interrogation may be a

perjsds@ib.le extension, although he disagreed with it in'
?

Starbering, but. a permissible extension of the Fifth Amendment.
feu I think the government in the —• at least th.i,s

13
Federal Government and the Solicitor General, in his brief in
the igaatovgg case, admitted that the Fifth Amandment might
apply to in-custody interrogations.
Q

Well, that’s what Miranda

MR. LKWIN: Right.
Q

— and other casos held, that compelled

confessions come under fch© language of the Fifth Asoandment, but
only compelled confessions,
MR, LEWINs Right.

But a defendant in custody — when

a defendant is being held in custody and he then makes a
statement, th© question of whether it's compelled or not is
really a question of whether he — and it's vary close to the.
border, I think, of whether he has waived some Fifth Amendment
right.

He’s being held in custody.

Take this petitioner,

arrested on the scars©, taken down to th© station house, within
hours.

He claims being beaten in th© car, being beaten at the

police station.
The real question is, assuming he had som© constitu­
tional privilege or certainly a legal privilege to remain
silent, did he waive that privilege in making the statement he
did?

Now, w© think that issue, the question of whether that
confession should be considered, i© very analogous to the issue
of the waiver of a constitutional right.

And this Court has

held, m far back as Johnson vs. Zerbst that courts indulge

15
— as the Court: said — every reasonable presumption against
assuming that there’s been a waiver of a constitutional right.
Q

So you think in a Miranda situation before an

in-custody statement would foe admissible, there must foe a
finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the warnings have been
given, ©fc cetera, and beyond a reasonable doubt that there was
a waiver?
MR. LEWIN:

That — I don’t think that question has

to ba reached, Mr. Justice Mbit©, in the square coerced
confession claim.
Q

Well, I know it doesn’t need t© b© reached, but

wouldn't a holding her© on your side determine that issue?
Q

It follows —

MR. LEWIN:
Q

I think a holding on our side would not.

It follows somewhat from what you’ve just told

us,
MR. LEWIN: Well, I think —
Q '

It follows.

MR. LEWINs

Well, let me just say, I think the fact

that there is — this is on© of several factors, which I
think bear upon this case.

I’m not contending that that, in and

of itself, necessarily determines the issue in the case.

I’m

saying that, the question of voluntariness vel non has to be
considered against the background of this being very likely

MR, LEWIS* s

Our initial argument is that on© would

Yes,

ME. LEWISj

But, alternatively, and I think it plainly

would cover this case, we contend that on© need only make on©
— the court need only hold is this case that on© must make

particularly devastating in the context of a criminal prosecu­
tion .

This arose on a suppression — on a motion to

MR. LEWINs

On a motion to suppress a confession•

16
Q

And, generally speaking, the moving party has

MR. LEWINs

She moving party has the burden of proving

initial illegality on a motion to suppress.
.

That, we think,

-1

is just not txm when you're talking about a defendant who's
in custody, .and whose statement has been taken from him when
he*s in custody.

We think that's part of the government's

total package of proof,

it's not like trying to prove that

the government has in soma way illegally searched, where there'a
a presumption that a search is legal, or that the government
has conducted unlawful eavesdropping, or that kind of thingt
where there's no — there's no factual background from which ;
cue can just .conclude that the government« is engaged in anything
questionable»
Her® the government, indeed — and hare, and I think
that's a principal reason why the burden is on the Stats, is
that her© there is a constitutional right involved.

Q

Well, the waiver would coma in if the man said,

Yes, this was an involuntary confession,

but I now waive my

right to be excluded from the evidence.

That's — that would

be a waiver.

It's quite different from this.

MR. LEWINs

A man 'who, in custody, does make a

statement is at least waiving the right, -although not the
constitutional right, to be. silent.

He has a legal right not

G

Well, that was said —

MR. LEWINs

MR. IEWIN5 The government is putting it in.

Q

That's what X mean.

MR. LEWXM:

— and it has to lay the foundation for

being able to use that evidence.

It's like a piece of physical

of any showing to the contrary, to be lawfully obtained»
Q

Well, I don't want to b® captious at ©11, but

I don't acjrsa 'that they have a burden to .show it»

They only

have a burden to show it if th© defendant raises th© question.
MR. LEWIN?

Of course.

If the Issue is not raised,

th® issue of voluntariness isn’t raised, then the defendant is,
certainly at trial, waiving any objection on the ground of nonvoluntariness»
Q

Well, certainly as a matter of evidence, it’s

admissible.

It’s a well-recognised exception to the hearsay

rule.
MR. LEWINs
Q

Yes.

The government has no burden at all.

It just

offer® it and it’s up to the defendant to show why it should
b© excluded.

Because, as I just said, as a matter of evidence,

it’s perfectly admissible.
MR. LEWIN; And the defendant, w© think, under all the
rules — I think that all jurisdictions apply — shifts th©
burden back to the government by showing that ho was then in
custody, and by ©imply saying this was obtained involuntarily.

And the reason is that it

Otherwise it's, as a matter of the

law ©£ evidence, it*s clearly admissible.

It’s a well-recognized

exception to the hearsay rule.
MR. LEWINj

Right.

The defendant then makes some

showing, and even if a court were to put the burden of going
forward on the defendant, and X think that's certainly
legitimately true, th® defendant must at least either assert,
move, in sera© way personally say, “X was coerced."
Q

Yes.

2tod then —

MR. LEWIN:
Q

And state some facts.

— show it.

MR. LBWINs

And state some facts.

That just puts

the burden of going- forward, though, on the defendant? it’s
not th© ultimat® burden of proof.

We think all jurisdictions

at least put the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the
evidence, on th© government.

Xn a criminal case, where — and

this has been the conclusion not merely of commentators, such
as Lord Devlin, who is quoted in our brief, but in State
Supreme Courts, both in New Jersey Su&rem* Court and the Wisconsin.
Supreme Court, in the Yongh and Kaiser cases which we cite in
our brief, talk about th® d®

When one's dealing with those —

Mr. Lewin, would you single out any other kinds

of evidence that ara devastating, as you put it?

What about

22
eleven eye-witnesses?

Is that devastating on the defendant?

MR* LBWINt But a constitutions! rule, we submit,
can't be mad® for an eleven-eye-witness case, nor do we think
there's any similar or analogous constitutional rule that would
be appropriate.
On the other hand, in Jackson —
Q

But you do have rules about ©y©-witnesses.

You

have Wade.
MR. IJEWINs
Q

Yes.

You do have a constitutional rule about eye­

witnesses .
MR. LEWINs
Q

Yes.

About line-ups, yes.
Well, that's what eye-witnesses are.

MR. LEWINs Right.

But not — well, to some extent

— I withdraw that;"right".

To soma extent that goes to the

reliability of an eye-witness.
Q

Right.

MR. LEWINs
Q

But- Jackson indicated —

Isn't that the same as the reliability of the

confession?
MR. LEWIN: Well, w© think the reliability — this
Court, in Jackson, certainly recognized that the reliability
of a confession is a much more important question and
involves constitutional — in fact, there’s a question of
constitutional dimensions, the procedure surrounding the

23
admissibility of th© confession; whereas it has never mad© that
hind of suggestion or ruling with regard to various other kinds
of evidence that may b© very damaging.

Because, as the Court

recognised in Jackson, there is a whole complex of values
underlying the rules against coerced confession,

Q
cal.

and —

Let me test one of your points with a hypotheti­

You put the emphasis, of course, on in-custody statements.

Suppose you have a situation where a man has robbed a super­
market, and he's caught right almost on the seen®, and the
officers have him in custody, he's got the loot in his hands,
and while they're waiting for the car to com© and take him away,
some on® of the citizens standing by says, “Why did you do this?"
tod his answer is, "I needed the money.B
Now, certainly, in that context, that admission would
be rather devastating, wouldn't it?

Would you apply all these

standard*;- that you list to that cm©?

MR» LBwins

Yes.

1 think a constitutional rule,

applicable t© post-arrest confessions, would ha applicable to
that case as well,,

And the only rule we're seeking is a rule

as to standard of proof,

tod, again, a rule as t© standard

of ‘proof applicable any place in the trial, the vie© of the
Illinois procedure is that n© on© in the entire trial, neither
the judge box the jury ever decides whether this confession has
been voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt.
So that means that there is a man in this petitioner's

24

position, for example, who is convicted on evidence where a
judge may simply have decided- by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the confession is voluntary, then submit it to
the jury ’with all the other evidence in the case —
Q

Well, you’re just assuming all your answers

there.
MR- LEWIN:

Well, isn’t that — that's exactly what's

possible under the Illinois procedure.
That a judge simply says, by a preponderance of the
•evidence —•
Q

Wo doubt about it.

How you're just saying that

happens, and it’s wrong —
MR. LEWIN:
0

Yes.

-- and so what?

MR. LEWIN: Well, if

if,,•one,'., there is a

constitutional right, and we submit that Miranda indicates that
there is* if, two, every necessary fact has to be proved beyond
a reasonable doubt, and that's what Winship says? if, three, as
this Court said in Chapman, where there's a constitutional
claim, it's important.that the conviction rests beyond the
reasonable doubt on no constitutional error.

All those factors,

we submit, add up to mean that in a trial, in a,criminal trial,
there should at least be someone, someone along- that entire
procedure, who says -- or was required to focus on the question,
saya, beyond a reesonabX© doubt this confession was not

25
obtained by coercion«
Q

Th© issue is on guilt or innocence, which is what

reasonable doubt applies to, so far, is whether he committed
th® crime or not.
MR. LEWIN:
Q

Now, wait a minute, Mr. Lewia —

MR. LEWIN:
Q

Well, I think —

Sorry.

it’s whether he* committed the crime or not.

And th© question about voluntariness hasn’t got anything to do
with whether he committed th© crime.

Th© jury is going to hear

soma evidence, including his confession perhaps, and they5re
going to decide whether -that proves that ha committed th©
crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
New, you necessarily say that because it's involuntary,
that it's untrue?
MR. LEWIN:

g

MO.

well —

MR. LEWIN:

It may be, though.

It may b©„

MR. LEWIN:

It may b© untrue.

And .so if a man — a voluntary confession may wall

be untrue.
MR. LEWIN:
Q

Yes, sir.

Now, what has voluntariness got to do with

finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?

as
MR. LEW.INs

You really aren't arguing whether it really

related to — you really aren’t arguing that# with respect
to the standard of proof as to guilt or innocence# that the

MR. LEWIN: That’s right.

Which is what this Court,

although it didn't talk in terms of standard of proof# but
what this court did in Jackson.
Q

It says —~

Well# I c&nsfc say that

MR. LEWIN;

There’s nothing in Jackson —* there’s

nothing in the due process clause that talk© about whether a
judge or a jury must make the finding.

Nonetheless# this

Court found# concluded that in order to be sure that there's a
reliable determination# it has to foe the judge who makes it.
Wo think that that very same hedge or protection against the

possibility of

All right„

MR, levins

— applies es well as to -»

Q

I got it.

1 got. your point.

Q

Now* you put m emphasis* Mr. Lewin, on simply

— that this is simply, I think you said in effect, what the
standard is, what standard is to be used by the trial judge
in evaluating the admissibility•

Well, aren't there acme other

collateral consequences that are involved when you com® to
review on appeal?

Is it not much easier for an appellat©

court to pass on the judge’s determination of voluntariness
beyond a reasonable doubt than to have tbs judge make a deter­
mination merely that a jury could reasonably find that the
confession was voluntary.
MR. LEWINs

I think that’s true# and t© that extent

it would support saying that the rules should be —
Q

Doesn't that —

MR. LEWINs
q

-- the kind that —

— do considerable# as Mr. Justice Black

suggested in his separate opinion, to take the fact-finding
function away from the jury?

MR. LEWINs

I think not# Your Honor.

©imply says to the judge?

Because it.

you make factual determination© ©n

this issue, as you make it on a host of preliminary or under­

lying factual issues relating to the admission of evidence.

28
But asi to this par licular issue, yea do it beyond
a reasonable doubt.
In other words, it just simply applies slither
standard, a different standard, to this particular question
because of the importance of the constitutional right.

It

doesn’t, in any way, change the judge-and-jury function, it
simply says to the judge;

do it by standard X rather than by

standard Y,
Q

Well, the collateral consequence I speak of is

that an appellate court, looking at that after the event,
never having seen any of the witnesses, can very easily say
the ferial judge could not have reasonably found this beyond a
reasonable doubt to be a voluntary confession, even though a
jury of 12 people have found it to be voluntary beyond a
reasonable doubt.
MR. LBW1N: Right,
Q

That's rather an odd circumstance, isn't it?

MR. LEWIN;
Q

tod —

No more odd than —

To be if we believe in the jury system.

MR, LEWIN; Right.

But no more odd than is true in

appeal from any criminal conviction, and ultimate sentence —
■©n ultimate finding of guilty, where a jury may find a defendant
guilty, and this happens more than just occasionally, and a
Court of Appeals, reviewing the evidence, applying "could a
r^c-y-r^Vv? man find this? defendant guilty beyond a reasonable

29
doubt®, a Court of Appeals reviewing that evidence says:

W©

think that & judgment of acquittal should have bean entered,
because © reasonable man could not find the defendant guilty
beyond & reasonable doubt.
So all that such a rule would do is it would apply
tlie very same standard as applied to guilt or innocence in the
Court of Appeals, to the question of voluntariness of a
confession.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JAMES B. BAGEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, BAGEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the

Court:
I think I first ought to clarify to some extent the
Illinois procedure \?ifch respect to confessions, partly because
the record in this case is somewhat atypical.

Under Illinois

law, the initial determination of voluntariness is mad© by the
trial court, by statute the burden of proof oh voluntariness is
placed :©n the prosecution, the statute does not declare what
that burden of proof is, it simply states that the prosecution
shall prove voluntariness.
Q

Was that true —

MR. BAGEL:

That was that —

30
Q

The issue you're describing for us, is that ~~

was that trua at the tin® this case was decided?
MR. ZAGBtis
Q

Yes.

That has always been true.

And it is still —•

MR. 3AGEL: And it*a still true.
Q

— the same thing today as it .was then?

MR. ZAGEL:

Yes.

So, of course, the issue as to whether it is permis­
sible to place the burden on the defendant is not really before
the Court.
Secondly, ordinarily in a criminal case.the Issue -Q

May 1 just ask one other question?

MR. SAGEL;
Q

Yes.

Under your procedure, is the evidence taken on

the question of voluntariness in the presence or outside the
presence?
ME. ZAGEL2
9

Outside idle presence.

Outside.

MR. ZAGELs And that has always been the procedure
in Illinois.
Illinois follows, in effect, the orthodox rule, and
has don© so
Q

Was that in fact so in this case?

MR. ZAGELs

MR, 2AGSL:
Q

It does g© to truth or falsity.

.And to whether or not there might be a factor

32
determining whether there was a finding of guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt?
MR. 2AGSLi

Yes.

Yes.

That is the standard Illinois practice.

The petitioner,

in attacking that practice, takes basically two separata posi-

*

tions.

The first is that in any case where the constitutional

acquisition or constitutional legality of the acquisition of
evidence is a question, it is the burden of the prosecution to
prove that it conBt.itutional.ly acquired the evidence, and it
is the burden that they must sustain by proof beyond a reasonable
doubt.
Now, X would point out, and it has been alluded to,
that there*s a considerable amount of precedent generally
against that rule.

In search-and-aeisure cases, the federal

rule does not place the burden on the prosecutioni in cases
where there is a warrant, in many States it places the burden
on the defense, in all cases where illegality in search-andseizur© is challenged.

That is true in Illinois, incidentally,

by statute, the statute that immediately follows the one on
confessions-, deals .with motions to suppress evidence illegally
»

seized.
I might also point out that in a few cases in which
this Court has spoken on the subject of burden, and those havebeen Bumper.vs. North Carolina, on the burden of proof, to

-establish consent search; end Miranda, vs. Arizona, on the

33
burden of proof to establish waiver; and in Uhltad.States vs»
Waste, on the burden of proof to establish an independent basis
of identification when there’s a primary illegality.
In non© ©f those cases has this Court adopted a
r® as on ab la - do ub t standard.

The standard is simply burden of

proof in consent cases; in Miranda the language was ’’heavy burden1in United -States vs. Wad® the language wasBclear and convincing
evidenceB.
Essentially it's petitioner's first point that, the
constitutional nature of — -she constitutional issues involved
make these questions special.

I would point out that only if

you take a very limited tactful viow of a criminal trial are
they made particularly special,
of hearsay are usually

of

Questions of the admissibility

extreme importance in a criminal

trial.
I point out that for example it is not the burden of
the prosecution to prove a conspiracy exists and to prove it
exists beyond a reasonable doubt before the declarations of the
co-conspirator can be admitted into evidence.
On the question of accomplices, which is a vital
question in most criminal trials, whore there

i&

accomplice

evidence, it is the burden ©£ the defendant to prove that a
witness is an accomplice, and that's a particularly vital
burden since that very often is the difference between a
directed verdict of acquittal and a conviction on the other hand

Furthermore, I. think that there*8 a confusion and it
runs? through all the arguments of the petitioner# between th&
purpose served by the reasonable-doubt rule and the purpose
served by the exclusionary rule.
It is clear to ©a, at least,, that -the purposes, of the
exclusionary rule are entirely' separate and apart from the
determination of guilt or innocence.

Indeed, with seme of

the exclusionary rules, mostly search-emd-seisure, their
existence cannot be squared with policies promoting the
accuracy of fact-finding.
Furthermore, the reasonable-doubt rule, in all of
its manifestations, every single one, .is -the rule that is
concerned solely with fch® weight of the evidence in a criminal
■trial, and not with fch® admissibility of evidence.

And Chapman,

upon which petitioner relies very heavily, does not change this.
First of all, Chapman is a case that applies only
whan the existence of a constitutional error has been
established and it says nothing about the burden of proof to
establish the existence of that error.
Second of all. Chapman is essentially an application
of a reasonable-doubt standard in a case where you are dealing,
although it is an appellate court that deals with the question,
with questions of weight of the evidence.

Because in an harmless

error context, what the Court is concerned with is fch© relative

with in Chapman is, at base, th©'weight, of the evidence problem..

that there would fo© casea where harmless error was applied,
that you could say that the error in question dealt specifically

But still it's essential in the resolution of that

.

.• V

problem, usually to weigh, the evidence as a whole, which is
what Harrington vs. California made vary clear.
The petitioner does not dwell extensively on its
first, proposition that all questions of constitutional
acquisition of evidence must be decided by proof beyond a
reasonable doubt.

He does take as his second position that

there is something in tho special nature of confession that
requiras proof beyond a reasonable doubt,
I would point out initially that the analysis that
h© makes is essentially incorrect.

I don't think on® can say

that a violation of the Fifth Amendment is essentially more
or less important than a violation, of the Fourth or the Sixth
Amendment.

I think that the values protected by the Fourth

and the Sixth are fully as important as those protected by the
Fifth.
There was a time, I suppose, when petitioner might
say, with some justice, that sine© the determination of
voluntariness of a confession is closely tied to its reliability,
that it presented a different issue.
tion is open today.

I don't think that conten­

I don't think it's been open since Rogers

va * Richmond, which has specifically excluded such considera­
tions from voluntariness.
There is some language in older cases which sought
to rest the exclusion of involuntary confession on fears as
to their reliability.
Q

But that language is no longer good law.

But Rogers,, v„. Richatond also said that your

instruction about probable truth or falsity is gone, too.
MR. ZAGEL:

I think that Rogers v. Richmond dealt

with a determination of voluntariness.

I don't think that

probable truth end falsity is banned when you stay to the jury,
You ought to consider the probable truth or falsity of a
confession,

MR. 3AGEL:

I do not

jury m to whether — as to weight of the confession.
Q

Well, it did not validate the instruction of

the jury in Illinois, because it's a Connecticut case; so I
agree with you.
MR. SAGELs

I might add that it is my understanding

that instructions similar to those given in Illinois &r@
given in federal criminal trials, with respect to weight of
a confessiori.
I point out, in addition to, I think, petitioner's
erroneous analysis of perhaps attaching excessive value to
the interests protected by the Fifth Amendment as opposed to
those protected by the Fourth, that his tactical assertion that
somehow a confession is more significant, is really unjustified.
I point it out, and I think it's fairly clear that
in any given case a confession may fee of relatively minor
significance; the cbm® of eleven eye-witnesses com^s to mind,

39

to® case in which a legal wiretap is discovered, is recorded
evidence of the crime itself? certain seised evidence? a large
quantity of heroin? in all of these cases — and eonetines
fingerprints — confession pale into insignificance, and
particularly the nature of confessions, end to some extent,
oven to© confession in this case.
Confessions have a tendency to b© filled with selfserving statements.

Usually a man does not, unlike the eye­

witness who will give a full and often devastating picture of
the crime? the confession is always filled with — or often
filled with statements, "Well, I did this but 2 didn't mean to"?
"I didn't want'to hurt the victim".

And in that respect it is

difficult to say, and certainly yon. could not say as a matter
of law that confession is always of overwhelming importance.
It is of some significance, to me at least, that the
principal case relied on by petitioner in his first argument,
United States va. Schip&ni, an opinion of a single-judge
District Court, in which the court said that there ought to. b©
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court specifically

rejected the suggestion that a difference could be made between
confessions and other forms of evidence•
Aad it is particularly significant because it

im

difficult, at least it was difficult for me and I started out
as an appellate lawyer before I started to try criminal cases,
it5a difficult when.one seas records of convictions and nothing

40
but record® of conviction, to make assessments as to what
evidence really ties the knot with a particular defendant*
And it is significant that the only trial court opinion that
petitioner cites, specifically rejects any distinction between
confessions and other points of evidence,,Q

That's the Schlpanl opinion of Judge Weinstein?

MR. ZAGEL:
Q

That's Schipani.

Yes.

Who was — have you analyzed the analysis of

the mathematical laws of probability contained in that opinion?
MR. EAGELs

Yes.

before I read the opinion.

At least I was familiar with that
That, is a general statistical

analysis, assuming, as is often done, that preponderance of
the evidence equals 5Q-j£us and reasonable doubt equals 95-plus.
I don't know that 1 would accept those figures, but the
basic mathematical operation is correct.
Q

Than 50 times 95 comes out to 50-minus.

MR. ZAGELj

Comas out to the 50-minus; would come out

to 50-minus.

Do you think that Is a valid analysis of this

problem?
MR, 25AGEL%

1 think not, because that kind of shock

your abhorrence of convicting an innocent man.

But you don't

Xf all you're considering is convicting an

41
innocent man, you don't multiply that 50-plus in, you’re still

Q

Judge Weinstein, as Mr, hewin points out in his

brief, was formerly a Professor of Evidence at the Columbia —
MR. ZAGELs
Q

That is correct.

— Law School.

MR. ZAGELs

ted I might say that his opinion follows

very closely analysis of similar problems by two Columbia
professors, Jerome Michael and Professor Wexler.
Essentially the Schfpani opinion is ©, judicial
adoption of a couple of Law Review articles.
Q

Yes.

MR. ZAGEL;

And it has not b©en much adopted In this

country *>
Finally, in this
Q

Doesn’t that reflect on the value of those two

Law Reviews?
MR. 2AGEL:
Q

Well, I’ve written a couple myself.—

Or on the judges.

MR. ZAGEL:

— and I would generally read the opinions
4

first and the Law Review articles second.
The third point mad© by the — it’s a relatively
minor one.

The third point made by the petitioner I think I

ought to touch on, is that the defendant in this case is in a
much worse position than Jackson was in Jackgon.^ng. D®ano.

42
I have two essential problem^. with that.

The first- is that I

think that's & terrible constitutional standard, that tactical
position determines whether a rule is constitutionally required;
or to put it another way, X think that petitioner would have to
contend that Jackson v. Danno decided that whatever makes it
more difficult for th© prosecution to present a confession is
the constitutional requirement.
My second difficulty is that he, th© petitioner her®,
is not An a worse position than Jackson,

The plain truth of

the matter As, accepting the premise of th© Jackson opinion,
the petitioner Jackson never had a hearing, an adequate hearing,
of voluntariness.

And the petitioner here did have such.:.a

hearing.
Th® other point in this regard made by the petitioner’
is that if the judge makes a determination that a confession is
voluntary by a preponderance of the evidence, then when it
comes to the time of trial the confession is introduced and th©
petitioner has to determine whether to get up on th© stand and
suffer all of the risks connected with his appearance on th®
V

stand; and he just do this without proof of voluntariness beyond
a reasonable doubt.
I think that argument cannot be sustained in light of
McGaufcha vs, California, nor can it be sustained in light of
th© guilty-pie© cases, th© trilogy of cases beginning with

MoM©nn vs. Richardson«

Mid in fact tha decision whether to

43
testify is made by a defendant without any determination, in
most cases? of important issues beyond s. reasonable doubt.
Defendant? in effect, can take a prosecution case which is
barely able to survive a motion for a directed verdict, testify
on the stand, and sink himself.
And in that position, a far worse on© than the
petitioner faced in this case.

He has no right to a determina»

fcion that the prosecution’s proof establishes guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt*
The final point mad© by petitioner is that he ought

to have been given a jury ferial, in effect, on felis issue of
voluntariness.

I point out that it seems to me that the essence

of Jackson v. Deimo was that a jury does not really, in fact
it’s constitutional incapable of giving a hearing on the issue
of voluntariness, that the jury will just not separate the
issues, that the jury will consider weight, probable truth and
falsity, and will not determine voluntarii .

. in the ;

classic sense.
I point out also that the jury determination of issues
of admissibility is not a traditional function of the jury,
and would not be binding upon the States under Duncan m„
Louisiana.

And at least in the few precedents that have dealt

with the issue, it seems' to b© rarely contended that there's a
constitutional requirement.
The existing precedent, such as it is, is against that

44
court®» tic®..
Frankly, the only way to satisfy petitioner's clairr
in this regard would b© to empanel separate juries on the
motion to suppress, because it would be only than, purely
apart fro® the issue of guilt or innocence, that the jury
could give a determination of voluntariness.
It's our opinion and our contention that a jury ought
not to be constitutionally required to decide a question that
this Court recognizes it is incapable of deciding.
