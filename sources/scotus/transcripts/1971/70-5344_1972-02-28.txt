MR. CHIEF JUSTICE JURGER;

We will hear

Hr. Leveretfc.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. FREEMAN LEV33RETT, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEVERETT;

Mr. Chief Justice a id may it

please the Court;
The Court granted certiorari in this case to
review a decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia, holding
that the beneficiary clause of the Serviceman's Life
Insurance Act of 1965 should be construed according to
Georgia law, and on that basis the words "child or children"
as used in the federal act were held to include
legitimate children only and to exclude the illegitimate
children of the deceased serviceman.
This case commenced with the filing of a suit
in the Superior Court of Elbert County, Georgia in July,
19S9 against Prudential Insurance Company of America, the
respondent, seeking the recovery of the ten thousand dollar
proceeds of a policy written under the act.
of filing-suit, the petitioner, Lorenzo

At the time

Willis, was the

two-year old illegitimate Negro son of a 15-year old mother,
Janice Willis, and a 20-year old serviceman, Johnny
•. R. a, who was killed in Vietnam in September,

4
1968.

The deceased was not married, but prior to his

death had orally acknowledged the child as his own'*

He

had also signed the statement agreeing to pay the lying
in expenses, and he had prior to his death contributed to
the care and support of the child.
In addition, the paternity of the child had been
recognized by the.Social Security and Veterans Administra­
tions for the purpose of paying Social Security and compansial benefits.

At the time of entering 'tie service,,

the serviceman, the deceased, did not designate a beneficiary
by name but simply checked a block on the form which
specified that payment is to be made "in the order of
precedence set forth in the law."
The act in this instance provides that the
proceeds shall be paid in this order of precedence.

the grandfather obtained them for himself, although
-a nnfu-d that chare was an illeg itimate son.

5
This action has been filed on behalf of the
minor*

Following depositions, requests for admissions,

and motions of summary judgment were made, the Superior
Court of Elbert County granted summary judgment on behalf
of t!ie petitioner and denied it to the respondent*

That

court relied upon lower federal court decisions interpreting
the- Federal Employees Group Life Insurance lx t, which it
held that 11legitimate children could take their time, the
four or five cases interpreti.ng the Servicemen's Life
Insurance Act had not oeen decided on f had r.cfc been
reported„
The Court of Appeals of Georgia, the immediate
appellate court, affirmed using the same approach to
statutory construction*

But on certiorari the Supreme

Court of Georgia relying upon three prior decisions, two
Involving the F.E.6.L.X. and one decided four months earlier
'wo ling the S.G.L.X., held that the words “ciild or
children” should be construed according to Georgia law as

found, with recpact to wills, contractsg inheritance, and
deeds, and under these provisions "child or children” would
include legitimate children only.
Two justices dissented.
X“d like to address some remarks preliminarily to
.v-otioti to dismiss zn this case on the ground that the

hil

.imprcvicfer..tly granted.

This Court g:.'anted

6
certiorari on November 9feli of last year.,

In early

December Congress passed and on December 15th the
President, signed an amendment to the Serviceiaan's Group
Life Insurance Act, HR 9097, Public Law 92-185, which
undertakes to define the terms in question iere, among
others, with respect to the Instant problem, "child" is
defined to include an illegitimate child as to the father
only if about six situations are met.
First, that the father must have acknowledged
the child in a writing signed by him.

Secondly, the

father must judicially have been ordered to contribute to
une child's support, or the father must have been prior to
death judicially declared to be the father.

Fourth, proof

of paternity be established by a certified copy of a public
record of birth or baptism showing that the father was the
informer and that he listed himself as father.

Lastly,

proof of paternity can be established from service
department or other public records showing that the father
with his own knowledge was named as father of the child.
Q

Gould your client come under an/ of these?

No, sir, I do not think so.

Q

The problem. I have is this.

four brother

on the other si.de tells us that because of the enactment
of this new legislation this case is no longer worthy of
consideration by this court on certiorari because
congressional statute has now cleared the matter up.

But

putting that point to one side, you tell us that federal
lax»? to be applicable and hasn't Congress by

hat statute

declared what the federal law is?
MR. LEVERETT:

If they have declared it, this

does not of course affect this case because the language
of the statute express and so declare the amendment.
Second, it does not eliminate the constitutional question
that is involved in this case as to equal protection.

That

would still be applicable because you still lave imposed
a burden upon an illegitimate child that is rot imposed
upon a legitimate child.

Anc under the rafcicnale of

Qyarma v. California you can see that the parents can foe
penalized for illicit relationships.

Can Congress itself

impose the burden, the onerous procedural burden, upon the
child where he is not responsible for the situation?
ire you contending then that cc useiVably the
.application of the new act of Congress could be
: .."icons titutional in some circumstances?
MR. hEVERETTs

My contention is, Mr. Justice

8
iUihnquist, that the new statute does not cover the facts of
this case, except it would exclude the child in this
instance.

But we also expect to show, I think it is

apparent, that the act of Congress really would not cover
the great majority of situations arising anl likely to
arise under the Serviceman’s Group Life Insurance Act
because of the fact, that it's so seldom that there is a
formal acknowledgement or that there has been a judicial
determination.
Admittedly, the statute purports
has, illegitimates are excluded.
sense.

:o say unless it

It applies to it in that

But we say that still does not avoid the

constitutional question.

That resolves the s tatutory

interpretation question, but it does not resolve the
Constitution question.
Q

It does follow as my brother Uehnquistfs

question suggests then that your ultimate claim is that
that statute is unconstitutional.

Or if the statute had

been in existence at the time that your claim arose, you
would still be making your constitutional claim and it
would be implicit in that claim that the statute was
Cii;-;titutionally inadequate.

MR. LEVERETT:
Q

Would that not oe true?

That is correct.

Don't you—*1 thought all the statute

.••.•frurrec'. was some definitive proof of parenthood.

9
MR, LEVERETTs

It requires—

Which you could make in this -•'ery litigation.

MR. LEVERETT:

Nc ? sir.

We could r ot meet it

here.
Q

Why?

MS. LEVERETT:

Because of the fact that this

necessitated some action on the part of father which the
father in this ease had not. done.

He had not taken any

action that would have brought him under—
Q

You mean under the new federal statute it is

not enough just to have proof of parenthood?
MR. LEVERETT:

No» sir.

It is not like the

Veterans Benefit Act of 38 O.S.C. 101 which cimply says
that although the proof is satisfactory, it is of a
particular and specific type of proceeding that the father
must have done prior to his death.

10
under the new federal statute, the '71 act»

It would

necessitate some specific action by the father in order to
be brought within the coverage of the 1971 amendment.
Q

So that once the father is dead, all chances

of coverage under that amendment disappear»
MR» LEVERETT;

That is correct»

,3c.,

unless he

has done something before his death to bring him within
one of the five or six categories of the federal statute
which had not been done in. this case—in other words, if
this federal statute had beer in effect at the time of the
death of the deceased, we could not corae within it because
the deceased had not done any of the things to bring—
Q

In effect, then, Congress has caid that it's

not a denial of due process of law to—for ■ 1 a federal
government or for the federal law to distinguish between
unacknowledged and acknowleged illegitimate! .
MR» LEVERETT;

Well, they have not said so

expre ssly but-~
Q

They passed this law which die make that

distinction»
MR. LEVERETT;

That8s right»

That's right, sir»

In that respect they have»
Q

And it is true, Mr» Leverett, tiat once the

father has died without having gone through some
acknowledgement procedure, year problems of proof do become

11
exacerbated?
■MR. LEVERETTs

That is certainly true.

But, by

the same token, where there has been an acknowledgement
orally or whether there has been as in this case a written
statement agreeing to be responsible for lying in expenses,
we submit that that satisfies all reasonable requirements
of proof,

And to require this other burdensome and onerous

requirement that the federal statute sets for- th is to impose
upon an illegitimate an onerous burden that is not imposed
with respect to legitimate and that comes within the
rationale of the Oyarma case,
Q

But if you say that the federal law controls

this case and as my brother Stewart says, where do you find
the federal law?
MR. LEVERETT:

No, sir.

The federal law does not

control this case—rather, the federal *71 statute does
net control it.
Q

Nof but the federal law does.

MR. LEVERETT:

All right, sir, our position has

been is that it becomes a question—
Q

How do you construe the word 'children" in

this insurance policy?
MR. LEVERETT:

We construe it in the light of

the context in which the statutory term appears.

The word

gathers meaning from the context in which it is used.

And

12
since we expect to show that the act of Congress here—
Q

After the statute had passedf the word

"children" would not include unacknowledged illegitimates»
MR. LEVERETT:

Ian not sure that, 'ir. Justice

White, whether yousre referring to the 1971 amendment or
the original 8 65 act.
Q

The '71 amendment.

MR. LEVERETTs

Under the '7.1 amend,.eat it's the

identically same factual situation that we have here, was
to arise today, the 871 amendment would cove;: if and would
preclude the child from recovering unless the 1971
amendment is declared to be unconstitutional
Q

Well, really, it’s your position then that

the *71 amendment, far from broadening the construction
that you contend governed before actually narrowed it.
MR. LEVERETTt

The 571 amendment it relevant to

my case only to the extent that the contention is made that
certiorari should be dismissed as improvident ly granted
m •;

vmsdo

of -T.be: fact that since Congress has cow solved the

problem as to the future, the problem has become one of an
isolated character, not meeting the requirements of the
Court for certiorari adjudication.

That is the only way

in which the *71 amendment is relevant here.
0

‘hi the merits of your argument, you are

arguing that federal law price to the *71 as e idxnent supports

13
recovery by your client»

And then we look at the *71

amendment and we see that under it your client could not
■recover.

So, we must assume that if you'reright as to what

the federal law meant before, the ’71 amendment narrowed
the definition of children rather than expanding it.
MR. LEVERETT:

Correct, sir.

Correct, sir.

We submit that the case relied upon for dismissal,
Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, is not applicable.

In that

case after argument and affirmance by an equally divided
court, the Iowa Legislature passed a statute which
prohibited the very act of discrimination complained of.
The court reasoned that this statute had rendsred the
pending case of such isolated significance that the question
was not. likely to arise again and hence it would not
warrant adjudication.
We submit instead that this Court's more recant
decisions in Jones v. Alfred n, Mayer Company, 392 U.S»,
and Su3.liv.an.»v. Little Bunting Park in 39S U. >., support
the retention of jurisdiction here.

In both >f these oases

several*”Q ' Would you say that Reed against Reed of last
terra would also support your position?
ME, LUVERETT:
Q

That one I have not road.

• I suggest you look at it.

MR. LEVSRETTj

All rright, sir.

14
In both of these cases, civil actions had been
instituted under Section 1982 complaining of racial
.ion in the leasing and in the sale of re
estate»

These suits were based upon transact ions that

occurred prior to the passage of the IS68 Fair Housing Act»
In the Mayer case certiorari was granted prior to passage
of the act and the case was decided after-passage.

But in

the sllivan case certiorari was granted and e. decision was
rendered after passage»

In both cases this Court rejected

the contention that certiorari should be dismissed as
improvidently granted»

In the Sullivan case this was-scal'd.

But petition of suits were commenced on March 16, 1966,
two years before that: act was passed.

It would be

irresponsible judicial administration to dismiss a suit
because of an intervening act which has no possible
application to events long preceding its enactment.
Another case is U. S. v. Yaezel ir.
which involved a

-382 U.S. 341,

Texas statute that said that a wife

could not bind her separate property by contract, a married
a man*

The Texas statute was subsequently repealed but not

until after there had been a small Business Administration
Loan made in which the wife consigned with ti : husband.
This Court granted certiorari and despite the fact that
the stato statute in question had been repealed for quite
number of years; no guestion was even raised as to the

15
propriety of certiorari.
The 1971 act cover,:, only situation where there
has been either, generally speaking, a formal acknowledgemenfc in writing or a judicial determination or some
similar type of proof.

Here none of those requirements

would be met; so, very clearly the constitutional question
that looms underneath this c.-.se is still present, even with
respect to the 1971 amendment to the act.
There are approximately 3.4 million members of
the armed services covered by this act, according to the
\-'A„

It has been pointed out by the commandant of the

Marine Corps' in the Warner case from Virgin

that the

great majority of servicemen do not designate a beneficiary
by name.
I think it’s also reasonable to assume that the
majority of cases probably have already arisen; as we
diminish our participation

l. r tai

the number of cases,

of course, will certainly slacken off.
There have been 10 or 12 cases recorded under
-Us act in the last two or three years in petition for
certiorari filed in the Supreme Court of Georgia by the
respondent in this case.

Reference was made to the fact

there was numerous eases coming up under this section in
which this question was involved.
Tld.s orings me to the merits of the case.

With

16

respect to the question, of the merits, I think the ease

can be most easily disposed of as one of statutory
construction.

The statute tore says "child or children»”

It doesn't say "legitimate children."

And there is no

occasion for interpolating into it, as one federal court
pointed out, something that is not there.

The statutory

terms should be construed, we submit, in accordance with
the context in which they appear.

When this is done the

inclusion of illegitimates is compelled.
This is so, we say, because the statute was
designed as a substitute source of income fox dependents.
This purpose is served just i ■; much with respect to il­
legitimates as it is with regard to legitimates.
Contrary to what we said in our brief, I think
the legislative history of the 1965 act does bear this
out.

Certainly the committee reports are solid on the

subject.

But the statements on the floor from the floors

of the two Houses of Congress do support this

There are

repeated references to the fact that this—rererence to
dependents, to survivors.

A Senate version w tich would

have limited the benefits to illegitimate children only i
designated as beneficiary was expressly rejected in favor
of a House version which contained no such limitation.

The oases also have recognised that this is the
purpose of the S.G.L.I. as well as the F.E.G.L.I.

And in

1?
coaaal ttee report—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE JURGER:

We *11 svispend until

after luncht counsel.
[At twelve o’clock noon a luncheon recess
was taken.]

18
AFTERNOON SESSION ■- Is 00 o'clock
l Same appearances as heretofore noted.

Justice Powell not

sitting.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continue,

counsel.
MR. LEVERETT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
At the noon recess I was making reference to a
House committee report which accompanied a 11-70 amendment
to the Serviceman's Group Life insurance Act which raised
the coverage

from $10,000 to $15,000.

In ;his report

express reference was made to the fact that insurance was
designed to provide support for dependents.

Respondent

relies upon certain statements made in the House and Senate
committee reports accompanying the 1971 amendment which we
have previously discussed, this effect.
The existing law does not define ft a terms
"widow, widower, child, or parent" for S.G.L.I. purposes,
thus presumably leaving such definition to local state
law.

This is relied upon as showing a sort cf retroactive

legislative intent.

This statement, we submit, has no

particular efficacy in this case, because it was not a
■ t t-\: ent made eontempraneously with passage of the 1965
-tut but rather made six years later in connection with an
:v.-:Mmenfc which was aimed at solving the very problem at

19
which this statement -was directed.

The United

Mine Workers

case in 330 U. S., The Unite . .States 'vn Wise in 370 U. S. ,
this Court held that staterae; fcs made not cor emporaneously
with passage of legislation but rather in subsequent years
by legislators who were endeavoring to amend that legislation
have little or no weight or * alue as far as interpreting the
statute.
Moreover, the statements here made were not
independent determinations or statements

macie by Congress

but rather this was simply a parroting the Itnguage of the
letter from the Administrator of Veterans Afiairs who
sponsored this legislation.

And in his letter of transmittal

he used this same language which was quoted verbatim in the
two committee reports as well as in the statement referred
to on the floor of the House of Representatives.
Lastly, this statement which says presumably the
question will be referred to state law not only is contrary
the majority of cases—there are three lewar federal
court cases- two of them decided since my brief was filed,
or at least they were not annotated at the time that the
vief was filed*—they are all contrary to the statement
made by the Administrator.

And, moreover, on its face this

statement reflects uncertainty.

And in the DaSylva v.

Sallentine case this Court held that statements made by
n administrative agency which adopted more from adapt as

20
to the meaning of "the statute rather than from a confident
interpretation of the statute, that this would ba given
little effect because of the fact that the administrative
agency itself is in obvious damage to the question.
Q

What do you do with DeSylva?

MR. LEVERETT:

I’m coining to that now.

DeSylva;,

we say, is distinguishable because of the fax that that
dealt with a subject matter that is entirely different than
the subject matter here.

And the DeSylva. case, of course,

dealt with the copyright act.

The question there had to do

only with the creation of a right, not the 3< -volution of
the right at death.

Here the subject matter is servicemen

and that is a category which this Court has held—
Q

Wasn’t that a question of whether the right

to renew a copyright descended to illegitimates as well as
legitimate children?
MR. LEVERETT:

That is correct.

resolved it by referring to state law.

And the Court

But on the basis

a determination that this was really a question of
Inheritance, that Congress really intended lx the copyright
act to establish rights of inheritance and ocnsequently you
fould refer to state law.

And, ©£ course, under California

law the illegitimate can take.

But here the» question

relates to a relationship that is peculiarly federal, and.
that if

the relationship between a servieemat and the

21
government.

In every ease in which this Court has ever

decided a question dealing with a servicemen, it has resolved
it solely as a matter of federal law.
thos cases in our brief.

We have referred to

There are three of them that

involve the N.S.L.X. Act of 1940, which is tie National
Serviceman's Life Insurance Act of 1940.

Two of those

casesi the Woodward and the Wissner case, dealt with the
designation of beneficiaries.

In every one of those cases

this Court resolved the question as a matter of federal law
without referring or even mentioning state law.
A person does not become a federal instrumentality
or agent by writing a book or poem or music.

But he does

become an instrumentality of the federal government when he
joins the armed services or is drafted.
Q

If this case came up today, if a serviceman

died today would your beneficiary be covered?
MR. LEVERETT:

No, sir, because ture was no

who is

And absent a successful attack upon

the constitutionality of the 1971 amendment, the petitioner
here would be excluded because of the fact that his father
did not formally acknowledge him or there hac been no
judicial determination.
Q

-That should an appellate court do when the

22
question before it is, What floes a statute mean?
the word ’’children5’ include?

What does

And, pending appeal, there

is a statute which says what it means, should the appellate
court take the law as it is when the case is decided or
what?
MR. LEVERBTT:

I don’t think you could say that

because Congress decided in 1971 that illegitimate children
would be included only in four or five different specific
categories that it must have meant the same thing in 1965
when it just used the words "child or children."
Q
is

changed?

What, if it didn't though?

What- if the law

Then you say it may not be applied

retroactively, is that it?
MR. LEVERETf;

Yes.

We could see that because

the 1971 amendment expressly said that it shall not apply
in the last section.
Q

To prior cases.

MR. LEVERETT;

That's right.

I would like—
Q
respect.

Mr. Leverett, let me interrupt you in one

The section under which you cure operating doesn't

hesitate to go to state law in at least two of the
categories, does it, sepcifically?
MR. TiEVERETT:
';

In one category where it deals

next ok kxn, according to the laws of th s domicile of

23

the serviceman * s—or, rather,, according to the laws of the
serviceman’s domicile.

Now, suppose you .might say that you

have to go to state law to 6 3termine who if the executor
or administrator.

But our point is, expressio unius

argument, that where Congress referred to the first st
law in S.G.L.2., it expressly so said.

In this instance

it did not in 1965.
Q

In the fifth category it goes •;.© the

executor or the administrator of the estate, which means
it would then descend according to state intestacy laws.
MR. LEVERETTs
Q

That’s right, sir.

Or under his will.

So, there are two

categories in which it clearly goes under state law.
MR. LEVERETTs

But by express reference to the

With respect to the constitutional question on

che matter of the classification generally, ve say that the
Sabine case is distinguishable because of the subject
matter.

The classification might well he constitutional

:.';x the context of intestate succession and act constitu­
tional when applied to a federal statute having welfare
type connotations.
But I think the easiest resolution, as far as the
.cui-cutionai .issue is concerned, is the additional
•rcallenge to classification on the ground that this
Lfication is really a racial classification because of

24
Les of the history

of slavery in this cou

t

In the Griggs case this Court held that formor procedures
and practices and tests that were neutral on their face
but bound to be discriminatory in operation were prohibited
by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where this heavier burden
placed from the ethnic minority was found to be a
consequence of past discrimination in education.

And we

submit that this same principle applied to the equal
protection clause in the Constitution and invalidates the
discrimination here# at least in a state havLng a history
of Negro slavery and racial discrimination.
That the classification falls mors heavily on
blacks can hardly be subject to dispute.

The statistics

in this record indicate that in 1957 the ratio of
illegitimates between blacks and whites for the country as
a whole was about two to one.

But in Georgia it was eight

to on®, in Mississippi twenty-six to.one, ±:i Louisiana
and Alabama about seven and a half to eight to one.

Q

Suppose it were 51 to 49 perdent.

Would you

make the same argument?

To the father of the deceased

Was he black or white?

MS. LEVERETT:

He was black.

We have attempted to show in our brief how the
institution of slavery was partially responsible or in large
part responsible for this greater instance of illegitimacy,
inci we submit that where we have here as in this case,.'v
number one, the indisputed fact that the incidence is}
greater; number two, that it is the continuing effect of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. FELTON JENKINS, JR. ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. JENKINSi

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I'm Felton Jenkins from Atlanta, Georgia, and
I represent the respondent. The Prudential Insurance
Company of America in this case.

Mr. Leverett I think has

fairly stated the facts that are involved hare.

There are,

however, two points that I would like to make just to foe
certain that the Court understand.
It's not clear from the record before this Court
that petitioner here is in fact the illegitimate son of
the deceased serviceman.

As was pointed out

written or public acknowledgement.

there is no

There is no father

listed on the birth certificate and the reeojds of the
Social Security Administration and the Veterans
Administration do not show that the petitioner has been
recognized as the son of this deceased serviceman, at least
so far as this record is concerned.

We do net contend

that he's not the illegitimate son? we just want to point
out that there is some question of fact on that point.
Q

The Georgia trial court found that he was.

:iko JENKINS s

The Georgia trial. cot rt found that

ha was.
Q

And that was upheld by the Georgia Court of

27
Appeals *
MR. JENKINS;

Yes, sir, it was.

The second point toat I wanted tc Make concerns
the

question which is before this Court,

stated in the briefs, X think.

I : has bean

The question is the meaning

of the word "child or children" i.n Serviceman's Group Life
Insurance Act,

That is, in fact, the ultimare question

that has to be decided, but. the specific question before
the Court, so Prudential contends, is whether* or not
reference should be mads to state law to determine the
meaning of that term.

And Prudential does

ic. t contend—and

1 want to make this clear to the Court--that we do not
contend that in every situation the word "child" does not
include illegitimates.

All we are saying is that

reference should bo made to state law and then the law of
that particular state would govern it.
Of course, it has been pointed out that in
California an illegitimate would be entitled to the
proceeds.

So, we do not contend that that is the issue

here.
There are three points that I would like to cover
in my argument, and basically they have been discussed by
Mr. Leverett.

The first point is we contend -that the writ

:-f certiorari should be dismissed as having b sen
iuptevidently granted.

As the Court knows, i\: was granted

28

on November 9, 1971, and approximately a month later
Congress adopted this 1971 amendment .

This .amendment

speaks directly to the question which is'before the Court,
the meaning of the word "child or children»1'
specifically takes care of that question.
just simply will not coma up again.

The amendment

That question

And Mr. Leverett has

raised the point and from so;ae of the questions from the
Court, there may be a question of whether fiat 1971
amendment is constitutional.
that it is constitutional.

We, of course, would contend
But whether it is or not,

that's not a question which is before the Court in this
case.

That question may later come up, and it very easily

could, 1 guess.

But it's not before the Court here.

The question which is before this Court has been
solved, has been resolved by this 1971 amendment.
question simply will not come up again.
our brief the case of Rice v. Sioux City.

And that

We lave cited in
It’s quoted in

our brief and there are several passages quot.ad from the
case.

I don't need to take the Court's time by going into

' cat.

Mr. Leverett mentioned the case of Jon ?.s v, Mayer
He contends that that case in effect goes against

the Sica case and shows that this Court shov.ll go ahead and
consider this question.
But in that Jonas case there was a juestion of
Che interpretation of whites under 42 D.8.C., Section 1982,

29
and that concerned the refusal to sell a home or rent an
apartment, on the basis of race.

While that, case was

being considered Congress adopted the Civi.1

.lights Act of

1968 and the Court held that it should go ahead and
consider the case which was before it because the 1968
act had no effect on this section which was under
consideration by the Court, the 1982 section
Of course, here Congress--the act that Congress
has adopted, the 1971 amendment, speaks directly t© the
question which is before this Court*

It defined the very

term which this Court is asked to consider»

For those

reasons we feel the writ should be dismissed as having been
imprevidently granted.
The second point that we would like

to males

concerns the question of reference to state law.
we rely on the case of DeSylva v, Sallentine,

That case,

of course, does involve the federal copyright, act.
not involve an act dealing with servicemen.
feel that that's any distinction.

Obviously

It dees

But we don’t

And petitioner has tried

to distinguish the case on two grounds.

He says that the

copyright act deals only with creation of literary and
artistic rights or the passing on of those rights.

But

this Court’s opinion, at page- 582 of that decision, pointed
out that the evident purpose of this section 24 which was
aler consideration in that case is to provido for the

30

author's family after his death» the very same question or
the very same purpose that petitioner contends the
Serviceman's Group Life Insurance—
Q

Can X ask you, please, under the federal act

as amended "child” includes an illegitimate fhild under
certain circumstances.
MR. JENKINS;
Q

Yes,

sir.

So, it’s not that the word "child" doesn't

ever include an illegitimate child.
MR. JENKINSs
Q

That5s correct, Your Honor.

It sots up some standards for proving whether

the child is actually a child.
MR. JENKINSs
Q

That3s correct, Your Honor.

Has it been denied in this case that this

child is a child of the deceased serviceman?
MR. JENKINS;

As I pointed out initially, it’s

not clear in cur position.
‘he child.

We don't contend that ha’s not

We simply say that there .is a question of fact

r that point, simply because there has been no written
acknowledgementj no father was listed on the birth
certificate5 there has been no judicial determination of
that fact.
One thing I might mention here—
Q

What if it were admitted?

MR. JENKINS;

Under the 1971 amendment, I don't

31
know whether they would fall under any of the categories
or not.
Q

Let's assume that they didn't, that an admission'

but the aim of the act is to have satisfacto: *y proof of
whether the—
MR. JENKINS:
Q

—child is a child.

MR. JENKINS;
Q

Yes, sir, that's correct.

Right, right.

Do you think the act would forbid then making

the child in this case a beneficiary under tie policy,
even though the insurance company defendant «■ dmitted that
he was a child?
MR. JENKINS5

Mr. Leverett makes that position,

and I don't know whether I want to agree wiki

it or not.

One of the categories here, if he has been [judicially
ordered to contribute to the child's support—well, I guess
that couldn't happen after his death.

I think I would have

to agree with you, Your Honor? 1 don't think in this case
he would fall under any of the categories once the
deceased serviceman died.
Q

&nd it wouldn't make any difference even if

the defendant conceded it.
MR. JENKINS;
of this act.

1 don't think so under the meaning

I guess at that point you'd have a question.

"i statutory interpretation.

Just from read! ,g the act I

32
don’t think that a situation like that would be covered
•under the terms.
Q

Even if under state law this c lild would be

treated as a child? let's assume that an oral acknowledge­
ment was satisfactory under state law.
MR. JENKINS:

Right.

I think that's correct

under the working of this statute.

There again .you might

get back into the constitutional argument th it Mr. Leverstt
says is present, that this 1971 amendment is unconstitu­
tional.

But here again that question is not before the

Court in this case.
point.

It may conceivably come up at some

But it is not before the Court in this case.
Q

Presumably even if your client were to admit

the fact that the petitioner was a child, you're not in a
position to make admissions for the father who is also
claiming under the policy.
MR. JENKINS ?

The next person down the line-

yes, sir, l?m sure that person would certainly have some
bjaction to it.
Back to the DeSylva v. Sallentine decision, we
imply say that there is no real difference between the

federal copyright act and this Serviceman's (roup Life
Insurance Act.

They both have basically the same purposes.

Another point is.Mr. Leverett has always

contended that the Serviceman5 s Group Life Insurance Act

33
has a

its purpose to look after the people, who were

depe: ant upon the deceased serviceman.

Well, that's a

littl

bit false in that the deceased serviceman can name

anyoi;

chat he wants to to receive the benefits under that

polic .
of hi

He doesn't have to name anyone who is a member
family.

Under the old National Service Life

Insur nee Act the serviceman could name someone that he
wants

to, but he had to name someone who had. bean within

his £ 'illy.

There were Specific categories that he could

not g

outside of.

anyon

he wanted to.

Of course, in this case he could name

Our point is that there is just no real
diffe:

nee between the federal copyright act and this

Servi eman's Group Life Insurance Act.
Q

At any time up to the point of his death he

could lave changed the beneficiary and made the mother of
these "Children the beneficiary, could he?
MR. JENKINSs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

One of the children or both?

MR. JENKINS:

Or any one he wanted to, yes, sir;

that5£ correct.
Q

Is there anything in the record here that

shows :he relationship between the deceased serviceman and
his £« her?

Other than that they were father and son, does

it she ■ / any particular dependency or lack of it?

34
MR. JENKINSs
does.

Your Honor, I don't think that it

The deposition of the father was taken, and the

son lived in his father's home up until the time he left
to go in the service.

I don’t think there was anything

specific on that point.
The next point that I’d like to make is this
quest on of congressional intent.

Obviously when Congress

makes some comments about the intent of an act after it
has passed, it’s not as strong as those comments would
have been had they been made at the time that the act was
passed.

But when you’re looking for congressional intent,

you try to find whatever you can and very clearly when the
Court adopted this 1971 amendment, they spoke directly to
that question and they said that presumably under the old
law we must look to state law.

And, of course, on the

floor of the House of Representatives the same comment was
made.

And I can't argue with Mr. Leverett on the point

that that’s not as strong an indication of congressional
intent as would be present if those same comments had been
made back in 1965.

But here again we have to look to what

we have.
Q

Under the 5‘71 act the same rule would apply

if he designates beneficiaries as his children, if he just
says "my children"?
MR. JENKINS:

I’m not sure if I—you mean if he

35
named the child?
Q

The problem here is that he didn’t name his

benef: .clary.
MR. JENKINS:
that

Right.

He just checked that block

ays to follow in accordance with the preceiident set fort..’

in the law.
Q

What if he says my children?

MR. JENKINS:
know

he answer to that.

that ■ esignafcion.

Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure I
Under the form he should not make

There is a block to check that he wants

it to go in accordance with the precedence set forth In the
law,

nd if he doesn’t the nest line down says, "Name

relationship," something of that nature.
to write in that name.
intra

So, he should know

You'd have another question of his

if he just put down the word "children/' because

there regain, I think, you probably would look to-—what does
the w- rd "child" mean?

And you’d be right back into state

law under this DeSylva v. Sallentine.
Q

Let me be sure that I understand you.

If he

had requested that the beneficiaries just be "my children,"
no name, would they have accepted that as a beneficiary
designation?

& private insurance company will not do so.

MR. JENKINSs
don’t
not

Your Honor, that’s a question I

really know the answer.

I would think they would

Q

Does this act permit it?

MR. JENKINSs

Well, no, it really doesn't.

If the

servi ^ asm an did it, supposedly he has got a sergeant or
someo e there over him telling him how to fill out the
form
fill

ad he shouldn’t fill it out that way? he would have
out the form incorrectly.

If ho did it, I would

thin! that the children in that situation would not be
enfcif ad to the benefits of the policy, I am not trying to
avoid your question, but that's a question that is not in
this

ase and to be honest with the Court, 1 don't know

the a: swer to it specifically.
We come now to the question of violation of the
14th .i mendment, the due process and equal protection clause.
The C art has heard a good bit of argument today on that
point in view of the Louisiana case which preceded this
case,

Lad I don't want to replow all of that ground,

Obvie sly, we contend that the decision of this Court in
Lab in-

v. Vincent, controls the situation here.

Of course,

in the c case the question was the interpretation of the
Louisiana intestate succession statute, and the Court held
that

he state had the right to make a distinction between

legitimate and illegitimate children in that situation,
and tb2 Court distinguished the Labina situation from the
situaiion present in Levy and Glena which was decided a
cbupl':

of years before.

37
Obviously we contend that we come within the
decision by this Court in Labine.

There are two things,

however, that I would like to point out on this question.
The present case# this case here# presents really a
stronger situation toward holding that the act is not—that
the designation# it seems to me# is not unconstitutional
than was present in either Levy or the Labine case or the
Louisiana Stokes case which preceded this case.

In all

of these three cases there was some impediment that the
Court has used the term ’’barrier”—"insurmountable barrier
and I suppose if you really look at those cases maybe the
barrier is not insurmountable.

There are certain things

in each of those situations that could be done.

But there

is some barrier in each of them.
In Levy

,

for example, the tort feasor could go

free if there were no one there to prosecute the action.
In Labine the father could not give the illegitimate his
full estate.

He was limited to only one-third or one-fourth

In the Stokes case, which this Court heard this morning# the
father could not even acknowledge the child under
Louisiana law as being his child.
Now, in this case none of those impediments are
present.

The serviceman here could simply have named

anyone that he wanted to and could have named that
illegitimate child to receive 'the full $10,000.

There is

no barrier whatsoever here.
Q

When was the policy issued?

MR. JENKINSs

Well, it’s a group policy and it!s

issue", to the Veterans Administration.
the d te of that.

I guess back in 1965.

1 am not sure of
The form that

this

erviceraan signed he signed in May of *69, I guess—

*67,

xcuse me.

And then the child was born in June of

that same year.
Q

Where was he between May and June?

MR. JENKINSs

I don’t think that the record

shows that—well, no, it dees because he was on his basic
training, that * s right, and he had come home for some time?
I am

ot sure of the exact time he came home.

He then

went to Vietnam, as I recall the way he was killed.
Q

But—

Be want to Vietnam after the child was born?

MR. JENKINS:

1 think that’s correct, Your Honor.

I hesitate and I’m not absolutely certain on that point.
But I think that is correct.

In any event, he knew about

the child before he died, came home and said he saw the
child; he also wrote some letters making reference to the
child.

So, lie clearly knew about the child and could have

made that designation had he wanted to.
So, first of all, we contend that this case is a
stronger case than any of these other three cases.

And. the

,;t ; ,->int -it- that there is a reason for the distinction

39
between legitimates and illegitimates, and that's really
the thing that the Court had looked to and 1 guess should
look

-a,

is whether or not there is any reasonable basis

for m .king this distinction.

And obviously, as this Court

point d out in the Labine case, the reason for the
disti: ction is to encourage the family unit. to strengthen
the family unit.

We might disagree—and obviously seme

peop.l

do-—with the merits of doing this to further the

famil;

unit.

try t

say this is a bad thing or this is a good thing,.

0

But that's not the purpose of the Court, to

The C art held in Labine that this was a decision that the
Court- -that the individual states could make.
reaso:;

And for that

we submit that there is a valid reason, a valid

distinction, for distinguishing between legitimate and
i1legitimate chiIdren.
In closing, I’d just like to., emphasise again that
Prudential feels strongly that this is not a case which the
Court should decide in view of this 1971 amendment.

We

feel that so far as this case is concerned, all of the
issues which are before the Court in this case have been
solved by the 1971 amendment.

The 1971 amendment may raise

some additional problems, but those problems are not before
the Court in this case.
Q

So, under the 571 amendment, if the

illegitimate child offers proof that he was actually a

child of the dead serviceman , the court just won’t hear him
urtles

he offers the kind of proof specified in. the

statu •j ;e.
MR. JENKINS:
that1.-- correct.

This is spelled out in the act;

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.

Mr. Leverett, do you have anything further?
MR. LEVERETT:

Nothing further.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
