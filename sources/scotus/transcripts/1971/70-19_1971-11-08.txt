OK BEHALF-OF THE APPELLANT
MR, GHEEii&W&LTi

Mr, Chief Justice# :;nd may it plcuxa

the Courts
This case is on direct appeal from an order of the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia,
dismissing an indictment on the ground thnfc the govarrrasmt had
failed to afford a speedy trial,
The government appealed directly to this Court pursuant,
to the old Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 3731, under
the provision that permits - an appeal from a decision or judgment
sustaining a motion in bar, when the defendant has not been
put in jeopardy.
Appellees were indicted on April 21st, 1970# on 19
counts of mail fraud, wire fraud, end transportation of falsely
made or altered securities«.

The indictment charges that

appellees, in operating a home improvement company called
Allied 'Enterprises, defrauded homeowners in various respects,
including persuading them to sign de®ds of trust on their homes
and promissory notes, by falsely ec^ceUIiag the natur® of these
documents from the homeowner».

4
Th® indictment charges that th© fraudulent schoro©
continued until February 1967# but. the l^st particular act
mentioned in th© indictment occurred on January 19# 1966 *
After the indictment appelles Marion ma<
dismiss the indictee t for failure

afford a speed

which is set out on pages 12 through 14 of fcb-3 Appendi;;-;#
claiming that the failure to indict sooner constituted a
violation or his rights under th© Fifth and «Sixth Amendments*
On June 8th# 1970# Judge Hart considered the motion
to dismiss»

It developed in these proceedings that in

Feburary 1967 the Federal Trad© Commission had issued a cease
and desist order against Allied Enterprises and Marion# and that#
in a series of articles in late September and early Octefcsr
1967# th© Washington Post had written about the activities of
approximately a dozen home improvement companies which the
articles claimed were defrauding the public# particularly in
ghetto areas»
The activities of Allied Enterpriesas war© described
in on® of these series of article©•

The articles also

indicated that'the United States Attorney was generally ©ware
of 'the abuses.that it reported# and that he planned an
investigation.

The articles did not indicate that an

investigation or the bringing of criminal charges was planned
in respect fc© any specific* company ©x individuals.
Either in th© swTmx of 1968# according to Mr. Marion#

or early in 1962, according to the Assistant U. S* Attorney,
ths records of Allied Enterprises war© fcurnsad over by Marion to
tii® 0. Se Attorney’s office.
At the proceedings before Judge Hire, Mr. Jackson,
representing Marion, argued that given the public knowledge, of
the*activities of Allied Enterprises, the failure to return ea
indictment until, more than four years after' the last noted
©vent, and more than two and a half years after the article®,
violated Marion's rights to a speedy trial under the Sixth

Amendment.
Mr. Pranka1, the Assistant U. S. Attorney, stated
th© gover.RK®nt?e position that the motion should h® dismissed
in the absence of a showing of prejudice,,

a© indicated that

so far as he knew, til® reason the indictment had not been
returned sooner was understaffing and a heavy caseload.
Judge Hart did not writ® an opinion.

He indicated

in an oral statement, which is set out at page 39 of the
Appendix, that in the absence of a justifiable reason for the

daisy, from 1967, and the likely prejudiced clause, there was
& lack of speedy prosecution, and hs granted the motion to
dismiss.
Appellees did not allage, and Judge Hart did not
find, any specific prejudice to appellees, such as the death
of a key witness ©r the destruction of particular documents.
Judge Hart stated that w$he ability to remember, to build up

s
in on©8ia recollection, to prodoce the necessary defense is
bound to have been seriously prejudiced by the delay.
This cas© presented the question whether in this kind
of complex fraud prosecution a defendant’s rights to a speedy
trial or clue process are violated, per s$, by a lapse of two
and a half years between the time it is assumed that the
prosecutor's office has knowledge of complaints that might
conceivably lead to a criminal prosecution, a laps© of two and
a half years between that time and the return of the indictment*
l say that the case poses the question whether a lapse
is, per s@, a denial of constitutional right because there is
no showing on this record that defendants suffered any particu­
lar prejudice or -that the government acted purposely,
e

arbitrarily, or even n

Lgently, in not

ise

foafor© the grand jury sooner.
We believe that there is not, nor should there be,
such a per ©e rule.

Lapses in time between offense and formal

accusation are, as this Court said in United States vs, Ewell,
governed primarily by the statute of limitations.

A potential

defendant is further protected by the rule that guilt must h®
proved beyond a reasonable doubt, a heavy burden on the
government that will ordinarily become greater as the time
between offense and trial increases.
I shall argue that the Sixth Amendment does not apply
before any formal accusatory action is taken by the government.

7
That the due process clause may reach certain exceptional
circumstances in which time has elapsed before formal accusa­
tion; but that due process is not denied unions there is
substantial and special prejudice to potential defendant and
serious misconduct by the government.
That neither substantial prejudice nor oorious
miscontent have been alleged here, much

less ah own? and -that,

therefore, the judgment should be reversed and the indictment
reinstated.
Q

Mr. Grc-@na.wa It, there is s general five-year

statute of limitations, isn't there?
MR. GREENAWALTs
Q

Yes*

Yes, Your Honor.

And that was —

MR* GRBENAWALTs That was applicable.

MR. 6REENAWA.LT$

Yes.

1 think originally it was two

years and then it was made thro© years end then made five years.

q

Q

Wall, that’s a side point.

MR. GREEMAWALT;
appealability in this cessa.

There is a preliminary question of
I believe our Reply Brief and the

original brief indicate clearly why appellees * motion before
Judge Hart was a motion in bar within the meaning of Section
3731, and I do not plan to discuss that point further.
Appellees suggested the constitutional questions need
not be reached her©.» because Judge Hart made a discretionary
ruling under Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure.
Again, I think 'the record and briefs indicate clearly
that the rule was not and could not have been the source of his
dismissal, and so X move now to the constitutional issues.
In our view, the Sixth Amendment does not apply until
the government has taken some formal accusatory action against

9
a potential defendant.

In -terras, it states that the accused

— the accused — shall enjoy the right tc a speedy and public
trial.

It does not relate to the spaed with which on© is .mad®

an accused.
Appellees suggest that the times one becomes an
accused should be moved back, for speedy trial purposes, to
some point before formal action, such as when the. government
focuses on a potential defendant, or has sufficient evidence to
indict.

Such an interpretation is unwarranted by language or

history or any prior decisions of this Court, and it would fcamost unwise for reasons like those which persuaded the court
to refuse to draw a similar line in Hoffa vs. United States.
Thar® are many reasons why a prosecutor may decide
not to prosacute.

Perhaps in the typical instance, it’s known

that a crime has been committed, but the prosecutor thinks he
does not have enough evidence to achieve a conviction against
a particular potential defendant.

But there are many other

reasons for not going forward, especially in this kind of
complex prosecution for fraud.
Not all frauds are criminal, and the prosecutor may
doubt if the scheme involved falls on the criminal side of fcha
line, or that Im can establish to a jury that it falls on the
criminal side of the line.

Or h© may doubt, ©van though h©5s

quite certain h© could get a conviction, whether the damage
don© to the public is great enough to justify using ®n

10
available criminal sanction.

Or if there ir >:> state offense,

he may wait to see if a State prosecution is going to go forward

If he is sura that son?© company representatives haws
participated in a frauds ha may be unsure which official-; of
the company are in fact culpable and which hr- can prove to be
culpable to the jury*s satisfaction.
Putting this all together, the prosecutor’s decision
whether to prosecute a particular person may not be made until
an investigation has progressed far beyond the point of ictus
or sufficient evidence to indict.
w© do not believe that a court' dan reconstruct, in
retrospect# when either of those points is reached.

And ©van

if it could, it would not make sensa to require an indictment
soon after either of those points has been reached and before
an investigation has bean completed.
Suppose, for example, fcfcet in this kind of case
probable cause exists on the basis of consumar complaints and
documentary evidence?

That the United States Attorney judges

that a conviction cannot be obtained'unless there is an inside
witness who is willing to testify to the fraudulent plan as a
whole, and can also testify to conversations that have taken
place in —

HR. GREEN&WALTs
Q

Yes, Your Honor?

1 hate to interrupt you, but was any of this

before Judge Hart?
Any of tills argument?
MR. GREENAWALT*
Q

I —

As I read It, all th© —- I hat-3 to ns© the. word

"defease", but th© only explanation th.® governments gav© w$?.s
that they war® understaffed.
MR. GREENAWALT:

That is correct, Mjfc. Justice

Marshall•
Q

So ho didn’t have the benefit of any of this?

MR. GREENAWALTs

Let an© make two points in reopens©

fco that, Mr. Justice Marshall.
First, the argument I am making now is not an arguant
about this particular case, but an argument as to whether, in
general, the Sixth Amendment should b© read to say that a
speedy trial — that one becomes an accused, for speedy trial
purposes, at. some point before formal accusatory action is
made by th.© government.
And so what I am making now is t general, argument
about the Sixth Amendment.
In terms of this particular case, 1 think there are
two facts that -- in terms of the sparse record before Judge,
Hart.

Ones is that Mr. Frankel, who arguec. before Judge Hart

in these proceedings, was not a member of the U. S. Attorney*a
Office at the time most of this took place, and fee frankly
admitted that ho did not knew what had happened in terms of this

1,2
particular investigation, but that he had been told that there
was understaffing and a very heavy caseload.
The second point is that tho government. took the
position, I think quite justifiably, on the basis of ©ay
decisions of this Court and of the great majority of other
federal courts, took the position that unless there war *r:.:.rs
specific prejudice, appellees her© had not oven alleged some­
thing that would rise either to a violation of the Sixth
Amendment or to the Fifth Amendment, and

sj©

ha relied

primarily on -that failure to show any specific prejudice in
arguing before Judge Hart.
So I think that he did not think it was relevant
what — assuming that there was not a purposeful delay — what
tlie reasons for delay were. And I think that’s part of. the
explanation why that's not more fully developed in thee©
proceedings„
Q

May I ask, Mr. Greenawalt, is the government

going so far as to suggest that if formal action is taken
before the statute of limitations runs out, that then there
cannot be a violation of the Sixth Amendment?
;

.MR. GREENAWALT:

Yes.

Yes.

It would be a question

of defining"what "formal accusatory action" meant.
Q
indictment#

Well, let’s assume it were.either information or
and it’s a five-year statute, is the government

suggesting that if an indictment or an information is brought

down on the day before the statute runs out», that that —» there
can than be no basis for a claim of Sixth Amendment violation?
MR. GREENAWMjTs

No, we concede that; tfe Sixth

Amendment is applicable to some formal accusation .before an
indictment, such as a complaint —- on arrest followed by
incarceration, we
Q

Well, what I am trying t© get to i® —-

MR. GREENAMALTs
Q

— taken at all —

MR. GREENAWALT:
Q

Yes, yes.

Until the indictment ~~

*— the day before the statute runs out.

MR. GRESNAWALTs

Yes.

Yes, that is our contention,

teat the Sixth Amendment has no application.
Q

But conceding that there may be a Fifth

Amendment?
MR. GREENAWalts

Yes.

We do believe the duo process

clause covers —
Q

And this depending, however, or* the showing of

prejudice?
MR. GREENAWALTs
Q

Yes’, Your Honor.

Only on that basis*

MR. GREENAWALTs But our contention is that in..-most
kinds of cases, what must ba shown is both specific prejudiceand serious government misconduct *
Now, I think it’s a little more complicated, in the

14
sense that if the government's conduct io really gross, then
perhaps the showing of prejudice might not have to be so great,
if the showing of prejudice is tremendously groat, it might ewsn
be conceivable that no matter how good the government's
03qp.lanat.icn, a prosecution couldn't, go forward»
Q

But this, in any event, would be exciunivaly a

du© process basis»
MR. GREENAWALTi
Q

Not a Sixth Amendment basis.

MR. GREENAWALTs

Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

I suppose you’re going to get to that?

MR. GREENAWALT:

X am, yeo1,, Mr. Justice White.

To return very briefly to the example that X v?as
suggesting, which is that probable cause exists, but tea
prosecutor doesn't think he can successfully prosecute, without

an insid© witness.
Then, let's suppos©, two years later, but within the
statute of limitations, an inside witness is willing to. testify.
Is prosecution to be barred simply because probable cause
existed two years earlier?

We do not believe there is any good

reason to distinguish cases

in

which the prosecution has little

or no evidence from those in which there is probable cause but
insufficient evidence to convict, and on which the prosecutor
will'decide not to go forward.
If indictments a?: a brought whenevar probabis cause

15
exists, the result would b© a great waste of resources in th©
criminal process;, and, more important, very serious misfortune
fco those persons who were indicted but novsr tried and convicted,
because the government indicts, because it realises that it's
reached the probable cause stage, and than decides it doesn't
have enough evidence to convict and dismisses the case.
Well, that's a serious mis fortune to the fellow that's
indicted.
Mr. Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in Dickey r».
Florida suggested a somewhat different point? that is, the
possibility that on© might become an accused "after the
government decides to prosecute him and has sufficient
evidence for arrest and indictment."
It’s our position that that point also is too diffi­
cult to determine, sine© a tentative decision to prosecute is
typically subject, to change, particularly in this kind of
case, as an investigation unfolds.
If that is thought to be the standard, however,
there is no reason to suppose on this record that a decision
was made to prosecuto these appellees until the case was —
shortly before the case was brought; to the grand jury.

And

thus on this record, even applying that suggested standard,
there is no reason to think that the Sixth Amendment is
implicated in this case.
I turn now to the due process clause.

15
It is our position • that, barring extraordinary cire­

sume tances , the statute of limitations set» tiia tima limit in
which the government can act against a potential v\-£:x>r'::;::.Z«
We do, however, believe that in carta:
circumstances, the due procsss clans© may bar a conviction.
For example, if the government purposely c’sXsvs co that wa
ill witness, known to be favorable to the defendant, has a
chance to die? and that that witness —• tha lack of that
witness is prejudicial, we would believe that that would
appropriately constitute a denial of due procsss,
But absolutely precluding conviction for an offense
is a drastic remedy, much more drastic than is involved :Lu fcl©
implementation of most other constitutional rights, and we
think it should be invoked only in such exceptional circum­
stances *
.toy laps© in timm between offense and trial may
affect the trial to some extent.

The defendant's primary

protections, as the court has indicated and as I have stated
earlier, era in the statute of limitations and tbs reasonable
daubt requirement.
It's not contended by appellees in this e&s© that
if the government had simply remained ignorant of its
activities, that the trial that might be afforded would be a
denial of due process •

mor

do they contend that they suffered

any greater prejudice than would defendants in a similar

■ fcuation, where the ge

ran

.

inec ignorant for three

years after the offense had taken piece.

Indeed, tfea possibility of prejudice here in a good
bit less.
Essentially their claim coses down to this;

because

the government had awareness of sone complaints and vies involved
in cases of higher priority, we’re denied dot* proca-ss, oven
though, if the government had been totally ignorant of wh&t
w© wore doing, wo wouldn’t he denied due process.
We do not believe that the right to fair trial turns
on such a distinction.

Only if the delay i© oppressive and

purposeful and causes specific prejudice «should duo process
b© hold to bar an indictment within tfca statute of limitations*
W© further think that if the due process clauia is
read to entail nice distinctions of time, subtle degrees of
prejudice, and the reasonableness of the prosecutor's ordering
of priorities in this area, the courts will h® involved in
)

time-consuming collateral proceedings, which will help to defeat
the over-ell object * rather than help it, of. an expeditious
determination of guilt -or innocence.
Turning now to the showing in this case, appellees
have made no persuasive showing of prejudice.

Hare, as in

Ewell, their claim is insubstantial# speculative, and premature.
They -have not suffered fron felvs incarceration and the anxiety
and concern that formal accusation may bring.

Insofar as
between salesman of the company and homeowners, it-s highly
unlikely that the salesmen who have many transactions ;:'rcl cry
would remember specific conversation months or oven reekB aftsr
the conversation•

what company officials would recall would be

their normal mode of business operation# and there is no
reason to suppose that that has been forgotten hare* ©specially
since appellees have had abundant notice that there operations
were subject to attack, first through this PTC inquiry, then
through the newspaper article®, then through a series of civil
complaints, and finally through turning over fchair record:', to
the United States Attorney.
It. is incredible to suppose that they have not
carefully considered and reconsidered how they carried on their
business*

Moreover# they*r© free to call any of the homeowner

clients they’ve had who do not think they’ve bean defrauded.

It is even possible that there won’t bo a substantial
discrepancy as to th® crucial facts if this case goes to ferial#
since Mr. Jackson indicated# on pages 28 through 2S of th®.
Appendix# that, at least about many of th© basic operations
©f the company# there is not a dispute as to the facts.
If appellees have suffered prejudice, that can be
demonstrated at their trial, and in the very small number of

cases in which convictions ha vs bec-n oviartumad becrxs® of a
lapse in time before arrest or indictment, iho court has made
that determination with th© record of trial ;l.n front of it,
such as in th© Ross, css©.
Secondly, appellees have not suggested, much lacs
demonstrated, the kind of government delay which should be­
held to be unjustifiable.

Wo have to suppose, on the basis of

this spars© record, that th© limited staff was initially
focusing on complaints deemed a greater social — concerning
companies deemed a greater social danger,

Anri that later

considerable time was spent in developing this complex case»
Fraud cases of this kind, and a number of the court©
©£ appeals have recognised this, ar© notoriously difficult and
time-consuming to develop.

A court simply is not in the position

of assessing whether an ordering of priorities is desirable»
Unless there is some special reason to suppose that this
ordering is being performed in an arbitrary way, th® court
should not consider preindictment laps® caused by lira feed
resources to be a form of .unjustifiable delay.
If this position is rejected, and an examination is
to he mad® of the ordering of prioritie®, which we do not think
is necessary, than surely it should be done in a full hearing,
which will allow development in this case 'of the facts
concerning possible prejudice and the government's ordering
of priorities

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS PENFIELD JACKSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. JACKSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it please

the Courts
On June 8th, 1370, District Judge George Hart
dismissed the indictment of Marion and Cratch, using his words,
/■

"for lack of speedy prosecution in this case".

That formula

of words can either be a paraphrase of the .Sixth Amend
requirement of a speedy trial, it could be an exercise of tha
inherent discretionary power of the court to dismiss for want
of prosecution, or it could conceivably have been an exercise
of power conferred expressly upon the court by Rule 48(b)
conferring power upon the district judge to dismiss for
unnecessary delay in presenting the charge to the grand jury.
With the exception of the jurisdictional issue, which

I do not intend to take any projected fciss® with, the principal
issu© raised by this appard. underlies all of the- varior
predicates, -the possible predicates for Jdga Burt4 a decision2
which is# whether any significance whatsoever is to to given
td the ©lapse of time between th® commission of an alleged
offense and the date on which the indictment is filed in
determining whether an accused should be required to &&on&
trial on criminal charges.

Assuming, however, that there is

technical compliance with the statuta of limitations.
Briefly, it is the appellees6 position that ihm filing
of the indictment is really merely a ministerial 'formality
which is exclusively, or virtually exclusively, within the
control of the government, and the government should not be
given unlimited and unsupervised use of th© entire period of
limitatione to assemble its case, and then to indict only
when it is, in effect, ready for immediate trial.
It is hardly necessary to emphasis©' th© attention
being paid to the problem of speedy trial today in this
country, and rules and statutes are being formulated in a
number of jurisdictions to provide that once the prosecution

has been formally commenced by the filing of an indictment,
then specific periods of time limitation should be followed,
following the formal accusation by indictment.
And it is our position that there will fas a frustra­
tion of those rules if the government can indulge itself during

tii© entire period of the five-year period of limitations, drying
which tins it assembles its car.©, which is largely in secret,
largely beyond the scrutiny of the defendent, and probably will
remain beyond the scrutiny —

MR. JACKSON: We don't expect that that will b® th©

The government contends that it was understaffed.
In the 1560's the U. S. Attorney's Office didn't, have sufficient
staff to prosecute them, so there is this skeleton of an

explanation on the' part of the government.

there are matters which we can judicially notice, are we?

He did certainly give the government. an opportunity to
explain why it had. taken 00 long to do so, and the only
explanation which was offered was that in argument by the
Assistant U. 8. Attorney who argv&d fche c©3©, who could. have,
had he had evidence of other

reasons, presented that evidence»

at that time.
I don't believe that the record can be» read ns pro­
viding for an abrupt interruption by Judge Hart of h:. „ Frenkel,
I think h® extended him all the courtesy and the opportunity to
make hie case that he needed to do.
I don't se® that the government has been denied an
opportunity, and the government, of course, knew that the facts
that w® to representing to - the court had b®@n mad© in the
motions papers and could have responded, had it. wished to do
so, with other facts of its own.
In 1965-1966, Mr. Marion was the proprietor of a
business firm which sold home intercom systems to homeowners
in the District, and without going into the business practices
in any great detail, by the second week of December of the yeas:

1966 the federal Trade•Commission at that tima had reasonabi©
grounds to believe that there had been a violation of the law
and they proceeded against Mr, Marion.
Mr. Marion did not contest thes® proceedings, and by
the first v7©ek of February 196? the Federal Trade Commission
issued a ceas© and desist order, and so all of the information

25
ahmit th© business practices, which the govarxnaenfc has. • •
characterized as a cosipless fraud ease, all of this information
was in the possession of the government.

Nothing else whatso­

ever occurred from F@bru.ary of 1967 until October of 1967,
when th© newspaper articles, coupled wi\ h eJitori&is ihueh
vehemently demanded prosecution of the people that', th® iv\®&poper
articles thought were the culprit®, ersposed then© business
practices to public view, and actually branded them as
fraudulent.
On October 4th, 1967, on th© front page of b:;.® Korricg

newspaper, Mr. Marion and th® ©nfcir© Washington, D. C.,
Metropolitan Area saw him publicly denounced os a cheat and e>
fraud.
Dealing with th© question as to whether or not there
is a showing of prejudice in this case, and I indicated to you,
sir, in responso to your question, that there is a shewing of
actual prejudice in that there is an attrition, or it era be
assumed that there is an attrition of human memory, a laya® of
human memory.
As a graphic illustration of that, at th© &jairD time
these articles wer© appearing in th© newspaper, the 1967 World
Series was being played, and Judge Hart; was asked to conceive
of th© difficulty ©f rememberAng the details of tho 1967 World
Series, which had occurred in 1967, not 1965 or 1966, as th©
events, the 23~monfch so-called business fraud, which th©

government allege© in this indictment*

And it is difficult-,.

X think, for sll- of us to xemsmber th* details of avsnta that
far in th© past.

On th© other hand, X think if you had played

Except as decided by bystanders, o:s newspaper

readers.

MR, JACKSON*

Well, that rsmaina fee be seen, Ydur

Honor, since th© case has not been tried: so I do not know,
Q

Well, the allegation is that your client is

involved in these things, isn’t it?
MR. JACKSON*

It was that ho was involved, yes.

Whether or not h© was involved in the so-called criminal
activities is another matter*
Q

Yes, it remains to ba tried in court.

MR. JACKSON:

Thase articles, however, war© filled

with ominous quotations attributed to the the» United States
Attorney, to the effect that a special fraud squad had bs@n

set up, that the chief of that fraud cgmd had bean relieved of
all other duties, and was f.

. do — tl

cases thereafter, exclusively, and that fee also indicated, or
is quoted as having indicated that he expected' indictments
within two weeks.
But nothing happened within the next two weeks or the
next two months, and it was not until, by Marion’s recoil
the following summer that anything whatever occurred,

‘iho

government remembers that it was winter a year vjhsm it occurred,
and that was an informal inquiry from the Assistant united
States Attorney in charge of the case to bring records and
documents down to the office* that wo do not know hew valtsainouA
these records were, or at least it

not appear of record

how voluminous they ware, but it can be inferred from the
record that they war© of no greater quantity than to have
required cm trip by on® ram to take them to the Assistant
United States Attorney's Office, which he did.

And he conferred

with Mr. Qlanzer, the Assistant United States Attorney in
charge of this matter, and he did so at some length.
Again, nothing happened*

An entire year passed, and

more, and finally, in March of 1970, Mr» Marion learned that ~~
Q

As of that time, had h© been' indicted then?

MR. JACKSONt

Your Honor, our position is that it is

a rule ©r ought to be a rule of reason, the question is when

MR. JACKSON;

I do not think so, Your Honor.

again that would be on© of the factors

I think

the government ought to proceed for an indictment*
Q

Do you think that on every indictment now, you

are going to expect the court to find out whether it should

I

to the reasonableness under all circumstances.

MR. JACKSON;

Again, not in all mail fraud cases.

It takes four and five

years to do those cases.

MR. JACKSON:

If the government had bed & reason for

delaying four years in this case, it could have been advanced
before Judge Hart, and was not.

The only explanation was that

this was a case of low priority and they didn't have enough
prosecutors to proceed with the case at that time.

MR. JACKSQNs

testimony as to actual prejudice.
But, Your Honor, insofar as wo era talking about a
constitutional right? we get into a great deal of difficulty in
requiring © showing of prejudice &e a condition to an
assertion of the Sixth Amendment right, this particular sixth
Amendment right, because a number of others have not required
a specific showing of praj «die® before they can —»
Q

Mr. Jackson, is your argument, the rule of

reason? ic that predicated on the Sixth or the due pxoctros?
MR, JACKSONs
the Sixth Amendment*

Our argument here is predicated upon
while there conceivably could be a dee

process argument based upon extreme circumstances, th© criteria,
which wo*re contending ought to be applied? is a criteria which
is of a speedy ferial nature.

It involves all of th© rights of

■th© defendant, the difficulty of defending after a lengthy
period between the tins of fch® commission of tks offense md
it involves questions of public confidence in the integrity
of the judicial process.

It — they as® typical speedy trial

criteria? and so it is not primarily a Fifth Amendment argument
that w© are making, Your Honor, it is on# which is predicated
upon an application of the Sixth Amendment to the preindictment
period,,

Th© pro*formal accusatory period.
Either that or it is an interpretation of either Rule

35

48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
to b© done, or an exercise of the inherent die era tic nary pewar.
In other words, to allow © district court to take
into account the factors occurring, taka into account the delay
fell© laps© of time between the alleged commission of fch® offense
and the time at which a formal indictment in filed ia sen;©
form, either as an exercise of discretion, as an exercise of
r

Rule 48 power, or under the; Sixth Amendment.
The government has, argued that Rule 48(b) cannot —
has argued in its brief and not here today

that Rule 18(b)

cannot b© construed in such a form to confer this power upon
the district court to dismiss.

That, however, is not a ruling,

©r is not a reading of that rule Which is compelled by ire .rul.%
itself.

And, in fact, so to read it makes it considerably

more a rule of substance than one of procedure.
Because the government contends that until an
individual is held to answer in the district court, in effect,
unnecessary delay in proceeding for an indictment is not
within th© consideration of the district court.

The district

court can only consider whether,unnecessary or not, delay which
occurs after the formal accusatory stage has been reached, the
indictment has boon filed.

And if there is impermissible

delay prior to that time, then that is not within the
consideration of th© district court in determining whether or
not to dismiss

decided on discretionary grounds without formally reaching tit
question of whether or not th® Sixth Amendment applies to the
pr^indictment period.
It is the government's position, as 1 understand Mr,
Gveenawalt, that, the statute of limitations must be the
exclusive determinant of the time within which the government
is entitled to proceed,
Q
bit earlier.

You war® discussing D.ickay v. Florida a little
And the facts in Dickey v. Florida as distinguish^

from th© general legal discussion have no resemblance to thir*
)

case,- have they?
MR. JACKSON:
q

Mo, they do not, Your Honor.

Th© reason for the delay by th© S.tat® of Florida

in that case was.that th® man was — Dickey was in a federal
prison, and it was pointed out in th® Court's opinion that they
could have reached him any time and brought him down for
trial? but they just deliberately waited until he was released
from — to b© released from the federal penitentiary *
MR. JACKSONs That is correct, Your Honor, although
there are — it was not too long prior to that, to Dickey
Florida, that there was substantial question as to whether or
not there was an obligation on the Status to request an

37
individual —*
Q

Weil? all 1

am

suggesting is that Dickoy v.

Floridaf on its facts, doesn’t have much to do with this ease?
does it?
MR* «JACKSON j

It — the facts are clearly dir-tinguisa-

able; there's no question about that? Your Honor»
But that does not? nevertheless ? rasa» th;rt fehr s.ls-bdi
Amendment cannot apply to the delay occurring b©tv;sen the
commission of the offense and the time at which the men is
formally accused of the crime.
Those — this Court? sa a matter of fact? in thn
Provo case? in affirming the decision of Judge Thompson in
Provo? by affirming that appeared? st least? to approve his
formulation by which he did take into account a significant
delay between the time that the government knew or ought to
have known of the facts of which Provo was accused? and fetes
time at which they finally decided to proceed against him for
indictment.
And that of course is not determinative of this csae,
because Provo is a unique case; it stands on its own facts,
it probably will never bo duplicated again.

At'least insofar

as the duplication of the documentation of the prejudice that
inhered in that particular case? and the formal recording
of the reasons that the government had done the various things;
that it had done

Tbs government suggests that we ought to be obliged
to make an actual showing of prejudice *— or an actual shewing
of oppressive or purposeful conduct, serious gevarnroht mis­
conduct.

That is probably one that -- o burden of proof that

a defendant will almost never b© able to carry.

It in

extremely difficult today to determine, very ofton, tha £act;«
upon which the defense must ba predicated.

It would be almost

impossible, and certainly not under the present stake of the
rules, to invade the province of the prosecutor’s office, his
memoranda, and actually the mental impressions of the
prosecutor himself, to determine whether or not ha had acted
purposely or oppressively.
I do not think, for example, in the Dickey case,
there was any showing of oppressive or purposeful conduct.?
those was ©imply inaction.

No consideration of tho motive of

the prosecutor, other than simply an observation that he had
failed to act during the period in time it was available t© him
to ect.
This Court, in the Kloofer case, in 1967, stated that
the right to a speedy trial was m fundamental as any of the
Sixth Amendment rights, and traced its origin back to the early
days of the Magna Carta,

And in the case of Escobedo vs.

Illinois, this Court held that the right to the assistance of
counsel, which is a companion Sixth Amendment right, attached
at an earlier stage than the formal filing of the indictment.

39

In other words # the language of the Sloth AwancLraanfc
.

was not so restrictiva as to permit iha court to look only to
postindictment availability of counsel# but would lock to the
period proindictesnt whoa it became necessary that i:;j; he so
protected# and did confer upon the defendant in that ewt-s f.h<:
right to have counsel even though ho had not yet boon formally
indicted.
That simply is the same rule that we ask that fch©
Court, apply in this instance; namely# that the Sixth biuvidwcut
right to a speedy trial, being -on© which is of great signifi­
cance# as significant as any of the other Sixth Amendment rights,
to be held to be applied in circumstances prior to the formal
filing of the indictment,
Wa do not believe that the statute of limitation®
represents an adequate protection.

The statute of limitations

which was in effect from 1876 to 1954 \im a three-year statuta
of limitations; in 1954 the statute of limitations was amended#
what appears to m to be very perfunctorily at the request of
the government# to obtain — to provide more time to prosecute
certain particular officials,
Q

X© that what the *»•- what doe® that legislative

history show?
MR. JACKSON: The legislative history shows —■
Q

Substantially what you've just said?

MR. JACKSONs

Yes# Your Honor,

It's cited in our

40
brief* it's in 100 Congressional Record, and it is — consist?
primarily of the remarks of Senator Williams , who .nirranded
House of Representatives bill to deny ansniltiess fee certain
government employees who had been convicted of certain crimes •
And a Section 10 amendment was added &t his instance» t*,c that’
bill, to expand the period of limitation;.? from three to fiva

years.
And it was apparently don® at the urgent requ-sst of
the Department of Justice, for more time to detect and
pros acute, these individuals *
There; is no showing that Congress took into account
— that it conceived, of itself,

as implementing the Sixth

Amendment right to a speedy trial?.there is no showing that
Congress took into account the considerations bearing upon the
— the considerations favorable to the accused, namely, his
anxiety, his difficulty in mounting .a defense, in expanding
•that statute of limitations.

And in the circumstances of this

case, it appears to us that -this is an ideal illustration of
fch© difficulty of looking to the political process, namely, the
Congress in its statute of limitations, t.e provide adequate
protection_for accused in criminal cases.
Q

But we have to assum from that that this

extension from three years to five years was thoughtlessly don©
without any concern for th© realities.
MR. JAGKSOM:

1 don't suggest that, it was thoughtlessly

done.

I do not think that the Congress, at that time, conceived

of itself as considering and implementing the rights of
defendants or accused in criminal eases? that tbair primary
concern was to provide the government with time tc ioeoct ;.,uf
prosecute criminals that the government thought that i - !u?.d net
had sufficient time to catch before.
That was the significance of the legislative history.
Q

All of these rules that you're suggesting, such

as the Second Circuit rule: one! recent actione in other areas,
have had to do with bringing cases on for trial after indictment,
have they not?
MR. JACKSON: That’s correct, Your Sonor.

And cur

position ~~
Q

Non® of those things reached the problem we’ra

dealing with here?
MR. JACKSON s

None of those cases — none of tt-oa©

rules reached thorn; and in fact our position is that they will
be frustrated, vitiated in effect, if the government has th©
entire five-year hiatus of the period of limitations, to do
whatever it needs to do to prepare its case, and then, and only
•when it is ready to go to trial, it obtains the indictment and
then announces immediately Wwe are ready for trial" against a
defendant who have been, during a four-year period, unaware of
who his accusers would be, what evidence would be offered to
support those accusations, and how in the world he could under-

49

take fco disprove the allegations that would hs trade ©gainst

him.
Under those circmstancss, si 60 or a 9 0-day right
to a speedy trial is, if anything, a liability fco him? ife
doesn't help him.

It put® him in perhaps a much wprse politic

than h© would be if ha had sufficiant fcizno fcc develop a aas®.

Mr. Greaaawalfc, you may

You. hav® 7 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT' OF R. KEKT GREEN&WALT, ESQ. ,
OS BEHALF OF TEE APPELLANT
MR. GREENAWALT:

Mr. Chief Justice? me. m;r

it

the Court:
I think, on the major issues, that the questioning
of the Court has don© a much more effective job than I could
possibly do, to suggest that the reasons why the statute of
limitations should b® regarded, that on objective cutoff should
be regarded as the primary block to prosecution at some time
after the offense has taken place.
24,lso there were a few questions, Mr. Chief Jus tic®,
regarding the hearing before. Judge Hart.

It was not a hearing

at which facts were developed? it was a hearing in which there
was legal argument.

And I think the way that Judge Hart

handled the case did not suggest that any elaboration of the
facts would be relevant to his determination.
I would like to mention just a few peripheral points.
First of all, in terms of the FTC cease end desist
order of February 1967, I don't think we can assume that there
is such communication between federal agencies that there’s
instantaneous knowledge by the prosecutor‘s office of every

44
cease and «toe 1st order of the Federal Trxdc Co-urr-ioMo».
Moreover, thin order was limited to a particular
aspect of what is now daisied to ba thr rsaudrdiStik scfcenu* of
appellees, it was particularly related la the s?.~3.es referral
plan; and I think if on© read© that order,, which is Exhibit t
in the .record, although not in the Appendix, one wood;- not
necessarily suppose that there was a criminal violation.
Secondly, some of the questioning suggested that
there was soma objective knowledge of a crime her©,

t": like

to remind you again that one of the problems with ?. er-f.ua like
this is that there are consumer complaint!? and you simply don’t
know whether those constitute true, and if true would indicate
criminal activity.
1 wrote a letter to the U, S. Attorney is New York
last year about sorts® communications between a photographies
studio and my wife.

Now, would that be notice if the prosecutor

wanted to indict the photographic studio three or four yeerr;
later?
notice?

If something appears in the local newspaper, is that
Is the Washington Post notice, because that's a mors

major newspaper?
Also, the Post articles, which are in the record,
indicated that Mr. Marion — attributed to Mr. Marion statements
that indicated that he realised that bis salesmen sometimes
went beyond bounds, but. his instructions to them were never to
d©fraud anybody.

So, if that were read at face value, it might

have been supposed that Mr. Marion, at Xc;^3t,

not izivoiv'&d

in criminal activity.
Thirdly, it's our contention th?.t «part from Rule-(a) ther© is no inherent discretionary pcwc-a to diaat.. <.r
at this stags of the courts.

We think it t this fallr, within

what has traditionally been considered to be within ihe
prosecutor’s discretion.

hnd X noth 'sat Rv.ls 48(b)

a :

to embody whatever common law powers there we re to dismiss for
want of prosecution, and that Rule 48(b) 5:X&.lnly eoso

■.a

this kind of circumstance.
Thar® is & proposed change in the Rules that would
give the courts broader power in this respect, bub we do not
believe the courts now have any broader powers, and thm w©
think the Court must face the constitutional issues that ar-a
posed; and also there is the fact that Judge Hart apparently
did not rely on any discretionary powers.
Finally, in regard to on© point that was suggested
by the questioning of Mr. Jackson, we do think there are some
situations in which the facts, the objective facte tfecntfolves
may suggest purposeful delay; which you know, when thcs case was
brought you know what witnesses axe put on, and you just con11
understand any reason why the prosecutor would net have gone
forward sooner, unless he had soma bad or arbitrary motive.
So that I don't think we’r® really thrust back in
all circumstances on finding out what11 rs going on in the

prosecutor5® of fica.
