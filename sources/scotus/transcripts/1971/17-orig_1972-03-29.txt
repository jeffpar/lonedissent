ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD H. MOLDENHAUER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. MOLDENHAUER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case, involves Nebraska’s contention that
the State of Iowa hah violated the Iowa~Nebraska Boundary
Compact of 1943»

In order properly to evaluate the

contentions of the State of Nebraska, we feel it

tie

that first we have to examine into the situation as it
existed in 1943 and in prior years.
The case of Nebraska v. Iowa, decided in 1892,
determined that originally the boundaries between the two
states was the center of the main channel of the Missouri
River.

And the boundary moved with changes of the channel

wnen these changes were gradual and imperceptible; but when
they were sudden or bv evulsion, then the boundary remained
in the bed of the abandoned channel.

These principles

applied at that time both to state and private boundaries.
There is no dispute

that down through the years the

Missouri River war, very notorious for all of its periodic
floodi ;

«any

fcural

as. anft it was

rtmor

4
knowledge that many times it had changed its course and it
had physically dissevered lands- from one state and left them
on the opposite side of the river, and this created all kinds
of problems in determining

jurisdiction, titles, which

schools children should go to, and taxation*

And the

legislative history of both states is replete with
recognition of these problems, and the legislatures have
boundary commissions from 1901 through 1943.
Commencing about 1934 on top of this already
confused situation along the river, the U. S. Army Corps
of Engineers set out to create a new and a stabilized
channel for the Missouri River.

This channel was supposed

to be 700 feet wide and was prepared on the drawing boardc
And then the Corps of Engineers, through the construe? 1
\\

of dikes and revetments, set about to'1 place the rive;.: 'n that
channel.

And, commencing in 1938, they also dug canal

physically place the river in the channel.

to

These canals

consisted in many cases initially of a ditch dug on dry land
and then they pulled the plug at the top and allowed the
water to go through and it scoured out through that dry
land the new channel.

At that time the Corps, when it moved

the river, moved it around islands, around bar areas, and
through bank area, and it created further confusion insofar
as boundary problems were concerned.

But the Corps, when it

channelised the river, paid no attention to the boundary.

It was not concerned wi th this.

St was concerned in
flooding and improving

the navigationo
By 1943 the Corps had dredged canals at at least
11 locations, and Nebraska feels that the evidence shows
at least 15 places, but that really is not important.
were several canals which they had dug.

There

And in 1943, south

of Omaha, the river was 99 percent in its design channel to
the Nebraska border, and north of Omaha it was approximately
78 percent in the design channel.

But this river work by the

Corps had further compounded many of the.
existed.
In 1943, then, the states, under the assumption
that the river was finally stabilised., entered into a
compact to settle their boundary.

At that time we think

the facts are very significant, because at that time each
state, and the Master so found, recognized that the shifts
of the channel in the past had been so numerous ana
cate that for

intri­

practically all land adjacent to the river

there was no conclusive determination of either state or
private boundaries considered possible.

They both

recognised that in many places the boundary line was not

located in.the Missouri River and that these places had not
■ apossible of determi

n.

And if a compromise couldn't be worked out and if they had to

make a determination of where the boundary had been fixed on
dry land, it would be an extremely complicated and
expensive process»

At this time and prior to this time,

the State of Iowa was making no claim to abandoned river
beds or islands arising from the bed of the Missouri River»
And under any common law claim of sovereign ownership.

In

1932 they had purchased some land in an abandoned river bed
in a well known evulsion with Lake Manawa south of Council
Bluffs, Iowa.

And they were not claiming islands which

existed south of Omaha where the river had been entirely in
the design channel since at least about 1938.

There v?e:ce

abandoned channels and oxbows all up and down the MasourJ
River on both sides' of the Missouri River, and Iowa had
made

no claim to these abandoned channels and oxbow.? -a?*- cither

side.
There was a case in 1938 in the Nebraska District
Court, which was eventually decided by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, called U» 3. v.
.Flower, where the Court found an evulsion and Nebraska land
on the Iowa side of the river, and Iowa was a party to that
case at one time in the District Court, and then the Court
allowed her to .withdraw, she - did, but she never came in and
claimed that abandoned channel»
The Iowa Code during all this period required tha?
■ Secretary of State was fci

s :ate land officer and would

I

maintain in separate tract books the areas of land which the
state may now own or may hereafter own , so that there would
be a separate record of the lands in state ownership.

Iowa

had no record of any state owned lands along the Missouri
River or lands which she was to claim at a future date.
The Iowa Code since 1923 had provided that the Conservation
Commission would mark its boundaries in cases where ths
jurisdiction—-or the boundaries of its jurisdiction with
privately owned property.
And then in 1931 or '32, they added where, the
commission deems it feasible.

But they had not marked

boundaries along the river where the commission property
supposedly commenced and where the landowners property
limits were terminated.
Again, the Master found, and we think properly,
the states didn’t know where the boundary -was located and
they didn't care, and neither state thought it was necess;
in order to settle their problems to identify or pinpoint
where the boundary was at any particular location.

or the left bank side of the river as you look downstream.
There were some lands on the right bank or Nebraska side
which were recognizably in Iowa.

Nebraskans were in

ere in possession and claiming.

8
And some of those possessions carae from some claim of record
title, others might have commenced just with open notorious
adverse possession, which was possible under Nebraska law.
The two states entered into the compact in 1943
to settle all this chaos and confusion and, as the Master
found, to accomplish the general purpose of settling and
laying to rest the boundary and jurisdictional problems
which existed between the states, and he found they intended
to settle all of their problems arising from the indefinite
nature of this boundary and from the work by the Corps in
channelizing the boundary.
Following the compact and before we go into the
terms of the compact, we think this is also significant,
parties in possession on the left bank or Iowa side continued
to exercise ownership without, disturbance from the State
of Iowa.

In many instances, the land was placed on the tax

rolls of the State of Iowa.

Some of it was

In 1946, owners of one of the areas about which

a great deal of evidence was introduced, Nottleman Island
or Babbitt. Island, by a lawsuit against the county officials
to have it placed on the tax rolls.
Their attorney, Mr. Whitney Gehroland (?), who
is presently with the Civil Aeronautics Board, nad notified
the Attorney General's Office of the problem.

They had

9
discussed it.

And the court found that they claimed the

land through Nebraska titles and issue of ownership, ordered
Kills County, Iowa, to place it on the tax rolls, and it
was taxed thereafter.
Q

Mr. Moldenhauer, I suppose this compact means

that this particular litigation is not a boundary dispute.
MR. MOLDENAUER:

That’s correct. Your Honor.

This

litigation is based on the compact itself and because
Nebraska was a'contracting party to the compact.
Q

So, it's rather unusual as compared with—

MR. MOLDENHAUER: We think that it’s highly
unusual and there is very little precedent directly in point
involving this situation.

We think the facts here, Your

Honor, are very unique and this case freely hinges cn the
facts as they exist.
0

In essence, this is a suit to enforce a compact.

MR. MOLDENHAUER:
Q

It is, Your Honor.

Which has been approved by Congress.

MR. MOLDENHAUER:

That’s correct. Your Honor.

And

.1 want to get into the terms of the compact after I get into
a little bit of this—
Q

And' that, I take it, requires a construction

of the compact, does it?
MR, MOLDENHAUER:

Yes, sir, Your Honor, a

construction or interpretation.

Really it involves the same

10
thing.

It's a question of what does the compact mean and

what effect did it have.

If we had not entered the compact

we would not be here.
Q

Nothing that you3re requesting involves a

dispute as to where the Iowa-Nebraska boundary is now.
MR. MOLDENHAUERs
basis for the suit.

Your Honor, that is not the

It will come up that there may be a lot

of uncertainty, but it's a part of the compact.

We're not.

claiming it, though, as the.basis for our appearance in this
Court.
Q

As a matter of fact, the lands about which this

controversy swirls, they are conceded all to foe in low»?.
are they not?
..

MR. MOLDENHAUERs
be in

o.

Your Honor, they are conceded to

Iowa now because of the compact and because the

compact placed them there, and we think this is a very
critical point.

In any event, there were other instance's

after the compact where Iowa either disclaimed land it. an
abandoned channel and they did so in 3 56 in a lawsuit in
the Winnebago Bend area where they disclaimed land, and in
'59 in California Bend where the Corps dug another cutoff
and Iowa appeared in a lawsuit and did not assert a title
or was not successful in asserting title to an abandoned
channel which existed.
Q

One last question.

The State of Nebraska is

here really, as has been suggested, attempting to enforce
the compact.
MR. MOLDENHAUER:
Q

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

Are you also here • as parens patriae?

MR. MOLDENHAUERi

If so, it’s just an incidental

effect because this involves our 190-mile boundary.
do" contend that

And we

Iowa’s conduct, which I will describe in

a minute, puts in question and uncertainty all of the 190mile boundary and really impedes development of the river
front.

But we are here because of the compact and what we

agreed to.
Q

If in fact leva had breached a provision of ■

the compact, would Nebraska have a right of recision, have
a remedy of recision?
MR. MOLDENHAUER:
that.

Your Honor, we thought about

I’ve never seen any cases where a state was successful

in rescinding a compact approved by Congress.

And if that

happened, we would have a far greater mess than we've got
now and I don't know where we'd end up.

We didn't think as

a state we could ask for recision.
Q

Then I gather your position is the remedy, if

there has been a breach by Iowa, must be specific performance »
MR. MOLDENHAUER:

It must be, Your Honor, and. in

the form of injunctive relief.
Q

Whoever might obtain it and in

co

12
I talea it, it’s conceded that federal law is to govern?

If

the compact is enforceable by somebody, the construction of
the compact is a matter of federal—
MR. MOLDENHAUER:

Yes, Your Honor, we feel it's

only enforceable in this. Court because it's an original
action between the two states, and we don't think Iowa can
make their own determination as to what her own commitment
is.
Q

Presumably an Iowa land holder could claim

under the compact, could he not, if I was seeking a quiet
title to his land and he claimed—
MR. MOLDENHAUER:
on his citzenship.
and what

Oh, yes, sir.

It’s not based

It is based upon what Iowa agreed to

she agreed to recognize.
Q

lie could be a. third-party beneficiary of the

compact.
MR. MOLDENHAUER:

Yes, sir, they definitely could

be a third-party beneficiary.

We do think that the facts in

this case have pretty clearly shown, though, that he cannot
affectively defend himself or protect himself, because this
river moved across three or four miles.

He didn't have a

chain of title like I have at my house where I've had one
property for 60- years.

It could;,

one time to this section or this section or this section or
this section as the river moved over.

As it went back, they

13

could re-establish the sections; they could call it accretion
to this section f and the river could be clear over here and
there could be three or four sections described as accretion
to this one, or it could be placed on as tax lots.

It's a

tremendously complicated—
Q

If you're right on the compact, he can raise

that same point in his own litigation and say that Iowa has
no right to go back here, before 1943.
MR. MOLDENIIAUER:

He can raise it, yes. Your Honor.

The problem is they have not effectively been able to raise
it in the past.

There is an Iowa decision which says, for

instance, in the Dartmouth Collega case, that compact had
no effect on private titles, but we think we can show it did
have am effect upon private titles.
In 1961, Iowa came out with a Missouri River
planning report., and I believe the Master forwarded copies
to this Court, which was the first document where they
publicly announced a policy of claiming lands on the river,
and there is in evidence how they selected these areas.
There is no investigation of any Nebraska titles.

They

didn’t talk to the landowners, they assumed anybody i
possession was a trespasser; if somebody raised a Nebraska
title, they automatically called it a spurious and fictitious
title.

And all of a sudden, all these farmers who had had

this land since 163, were farming it, found they were under

i

attack by the State of Iowa; they couldn

difficult, and they couldn’t understand the situation they
had been placed in»
Mow„ going back to the compact which was a
compromise, first it was an agreement between the two states,
and Iowa bound herself in this compact»

Q

■ ■

a'y-3 a j

icn problem, I take

it,
MR. MOLDENHAOER;

Absolutely, but there has been

no provision for compensation under anything that Iowa has
done.

She has done it supposedly under common law.

And this

is the basis for a planning report,, that in Iowa the common
law provides the state owns the beds of navigable rivers.
In Nebraska the principle has always been that the state
has a public easement for navigation, but the riparian owner
owns it, and this includes accretion to the bed of that
river.
But Section 1 changed the situation all along the
boundary.

So land in a very strict technical sense was

transferred back and forth all along that river.

Then in

Section 2, of course, they recognize the lands on each i.ide
were ceded, and the really operative language is Sections
3 and 4.
In Section 3 they said basically titles, mortgages
and other means good in Nebraska shall be good in Iowa.
to lands, Nebraska shall cede to Iowa.
can be prosecuted in the final judgment.

-As

Any pending suits
Iowa says, "Oh,

yes, you’ve got to prove it was good in Nebraska before we
have to recognize the title."
Our contention is, "Iowa, you agreed in a context
where you were making 'no claims.

You agreed in a context

where you recognised the uncertain situation.

You agreed in

a context where you didn't want to find the boundary, you
wanted to avoid it."

7md the compact should be construed as

the Master read it, to cover all lands in the situation
which existed along the river in 1943, because that's what
they were referring to.
Q

But Iowa's promise referred to ceded lands.

MR. MOLDENIIAUER:

It says as to lands—-shall be

good in Iowa as to any lands. Nebraska may cede to Iowa.
Q

The ceded lands you think are those Nebraska

would have recognised before 1943?
MR. MOLDENIIAUER:

Yes, sir, without the necessity

of determining where the boundary actually was.
Q

Without the necessity of proving whether

Nebraska was right or not in recognizing-MR. MOLDENIIAUER:

Right, Your Honor, because

everybody recognized the confused situation and the difficulty
of determining where the actual boundary was.

Q

You say if a party, for instance, had a proper

Chain of title under Nebraska law and presented that to the
Iowa courts, Iowa should recognise it?
MR. MOLDENIIAUER:

Yes, sir, Your Honor*, recognizing

again that that proper chain ox title may consist of some
posse ssory rights or what some people might call'paper title
foecau se you don't have a paper title.

So, we.don't feel,that

can conduct herself

because she agreed that they’re good, but then she’d come
in and attack them.

And we say this is binding on her court

on her legislative and executive branches.
say we're going to go

So, she can't

into our courtsr because her courts

are also bound by what her commitment was.

That is one

basic proposition.
Section 3, we feel, was language of recognition
of a situation in private title.

Then the states added

Section 4, which said that taxes for the current year

can.

be levied on lands ceded to the other state for one year,
and that any rights under those taxes accrued or accruing
would be asserted in five years or be forever barred, and
the states would stop taxing across the river.

So, four, we

feel, was a limitation on what the states can do.

Three was

a recognition of private rights, and the states looked at
this and said, "Now we've solved our problem.
more problems.

We’re through."

We have no

And we think that this

compact has to be construed literally to effectuate the
intention for which it was adopted, and that was settle all
the problems.
We agree with the Master’s finding that in any
action by a landowner or by Iowa along the river, that the
landowner should not have to prove where the boundary was
beforehand„

If he raises some Nebraska title, Iowa should

have to recognize it.
even inquire.

The evidence is clear that Iowa didn't

And when the titles were raised, she has said

they're spurious and fictitious.

We go a little further and

contend that Iowa shouldn't be able to raise all these
problems, that we ought to be placed in the situation We
were in 1943 and for at least 15 years thereafter before
Iowa started asserting these claims.

And if that means that

Iowa has to recognize the Nebraska owners' titles tc the
bed and Iowa has an easement for public navigation as
Nebraska has or as all the public has, she hasn't been
deprived of anything.
There were areas where the river was entirely in
Nebraska at the time of the compact.

And in those areas,

many of which the states did not want to determine, our
contention is that the entire bed was in Nebraska; and when
Iowa said titles good in Nebraska shall foe good-in Iowa, she
is recognizing the title to the bad.

She didn't accept it.

Iowa's position now is, "We own the entire bed because it's
in Iowa."
Another issue which has corae up was originally
decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit, I think in November of 1960, in which
another situation where there is no question about the
facts occurred.

The river was in the design channel.

moved out into Iowa; land built up behind it.

It

And the Corps

of Engineers placed it back in the design channel»

This

case involved between twelve and thirteen thousand dollars
of damages, condemnation by the Corps of Engineers for placing
the river back in the design channel or the boundary.
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said
that the land is in Iowa? Iowa owns the bed; therefore?
Iowa owns it.

And the Nebraska riparian owner was deprived

of his ownership.

Iowa has used that principle in order to

make her claim to all lands north of Omaha.

Our position is

this? that when we intended to settle this thing we didn't
change the private property owners' boundary.

It should

have stayed the same? because we couldn't divest them of
their property rights without due process of law and without
eompen s ation.
Had it. not been for the compact? when that river
moved into Iowa, the Nebraska riparian owners' rights, which
extended to the thalweg or thread of the stream, moved with
because that’s a private property boundary matter and it
moved over.

And when the court put it. back without washing

away the intervening islands, it was an evulsion which left
that private property boundary remaining over into Igwa, and
the Nebraska riparian owner should have had preserved to him
his right to his accretions.

If it is read otherwise, then

we say that that Nebraska riparian owner has been deprived
of his property without due process of law.

20

It's very easy to say the land is in Iowa?
therefore,, Iowa law applies? therefore, Iowa owns it»

But

the fact is what would the parties agree to, and we say Iowa
law is what the compact provides, requiring Iowa to recognise
private rights.

And we say that it would have to say in the

Tyson case but for the compact the boundary would have been
clear over into Iowa.

The states avoided the necessity of

worrying about that as between themselves.

But they shouldn’t

be able to deprive the riparian owner of his rights because
of their agreement.
Q

Nebraska as a proprietor of land isn't involved

in this dispute at all.
MR. MOLDENHAUER%

No, sir, Your Honor.

because wa didn't just agree to a new boundary.

We are here
If we had

Section 1 and said here's the boundary and stopped, it might
ba a different situation.

But we said no.

We have three and

four here where you, Iowa, have to engage in certain conduct
to assure us that we're getting what we bargained for, and
we agree to do the same thing for you,
Section 1 to show the lands in Iowa.
can do it.

Iowa has to rely on
That's the only way she

And she doss rely on Section 1.

So, she-is relying

in part upon that compact to establish jurisdiction.

Then

she says, "Jurisdiction establishes our title because we're
in Iowa and we own the bed."
Q

So, the basis for the bringing of your suit

here is the original ju risdiction of this Court, isn't it?
There is nothing added to that jurisdiction by the provision
for interstate compacts , so far as the jurisdiction is
concerned.
MR. MOLDENHAUER:

The jurisdiction is because we

entered into the compact pursuant to authority of the
Constitution, and this is an action regarding that compact.
When the states came into 'the union, they gave up their
right to solve their problems any other way.

And when we do

it by compact, this is the proper place to tell us what that
compact means and what conduct is proper pursuant to it.
Q

Would you say then that this Court has

original jurisdiction, should exercise original jurisdiction,
on every single claim that might be made under an interstate
compact?
MR. MOLDENHAUER:

1 think essentially as between

the states, yes, because I think if they can't---we’re
involved in this specific one—but if they can’t, there is
no place else where they can go.to solve their problems.
And if they can’t solve their problems somewhere, there is
no incentive to enter into compacts at all.

And this Court

has often suggested courts try to settle their problems by
entering into a compact.

This is what we did.

We think it

settled our problems, and we think the Court should tell the
State of Iowa and everyone that this is how it settled it

and this is what you can do pursuant to it.
Q

But the jurisdiction of this Court rests on the,'

fact that the parties are two sovereign states, not on the
fact that it's a controversy about a compact.
MR,, KOLDENHAUER;

Oh, no.

It rests on the fact

the parties are two sovereign states, and they entered into
an agreement pursuant to the Constitution and consent of
Congress.
Q

But whether or not they had, we would have

exclusive and original jurisdiction in this lawsuit because
it is a lawsuit between

two states, whether the subsnance

of the lawsuit grows, out of an interstate compact or grows
out of a common law nuisance or whatever.
MR. MOLDSNH&UERs

Essentially correct, Your Honor,

hut it has to be a controversy.
Q

It has to be a controversy. .

MR. MQLDENHAUER;
Q

That’s correct.

And it has to be a case or controversy, and you

B&y it's a case or controversy because your contractual

rights for which you gave consideration are at issue here.
MR. MQLDENHAUER:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

That•s correct.
q

Mr. Moldenhauer, how do you distinguish this

case from the old Dakota, North Carolina bond case, where in
effect South Dakota gave consideration for the North Carolina

23
bond# sued or it# and this Court declined to exercise
jurisdiction because it said that South Dakota was basically
suing on behalf of its residents# even though it had the
nominal title to the bond»
MR. KOLDENHAUER:

Your Honor, that may be that the

nominal title may be the distinction; in this case it involved
our boundary which has always been a matter of state
interest# and when the states were admitted into the union#
controversy as to boundary and agreements as to boundary
were in existence and traditional and historical.
Q

But there is

no dispute here as to the

boundary between Nebraska and Iowa.
MR. M0LD3KHAUER:

Because we agreed to where it

was.
Q

It might very well be# if you can't get what

you bargained for.
MR. MOLDENHAUER;

That's right.

If we can't get

what we bargained for, although Nebraska—
Q

You'11 be up here with an original boundary

line suit.
MR. MOLDENHAUER:

Although Nebraska would never

bear arms, I don't know about the farmers here.
Q

Has there been any real dispute as to the

present boundary between the State of Nebraska and the State
of Iowa under this compact?

MR. MOLDENHAUER:

There is a real question of

where it is, because the documents they used in defining it
were so general that they didn't have sufficient data to
allow a surveyor to lay it on the ground.
we're here though.

That is not why

That's another aid in construction,

Your Honor, that they used a very general agreement to
generally settle, because they didn't lay it out on the
ground, they didn't have*—they used some maps that are like
.road maps almost.
Q

Did we argue these matters before?

MR. MOLDENHAUER:
Q

We argued everything, Your Honor

You argued as to whether there was a case or

controversy here?
MR. MOLDENHAUER:

Yes, sir, and we had a two-hour

argument and we went through—
Q

That was back in ’65.

MR. MOLDENHAUER:

565.

-

We went through the whole

thing.
Q

And we granted leave to file.

MR. MOLDENHAUER:
in one week.

And you granted leave to file,

In fact. Your Honor, at that time 1 made the

comment—and I'll never forget it—Mr. Justice Brennan said,
"Isn't this an action to enforce the compact?"

I said,

"Yes, Your Honor, maybe I ought to say that and sit down,"
and he looked at me and said, "Maybe you ought to.”

But we

25
had to give you the full picture because we did not want to
mislead this Court.

And I don’t think we did. mislead them.

We feel that it is necessary to settle this because there
are approximately 47 miles at the present time where, the
boundary—-where the river is not located in the boundary,
it has moved out north of Omaha, and unless we find out what
we agreed to in 1943, it's almost going to prevent another
agreement which is necessary, and the present situation we
feel impedes the development of lands along the Missouri
River and it really results in a government of men and not
of laws along the Missouri River.
Your Honor, X wish to reserve the remainder of my
time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. MoIdenhauer.
Mr. Murray, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MURRAY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. MURRAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I want to rearrange the order of my remarks a bit
due to the line of questions which the Court has just been
asking Mr. MoIdenhauer»

It is Iowa's position that this is

not a proper case for this Court to exercise its original
j uris dIc11on.

26
Q

You'll fell us X assume very early why that

bridge wasn't crossed in 1965«
MR. MURRAY;

It's our understanding, Your Honor,

that whether or not a permission is given to file a complaint
is dealt with usually in soft of a pro forma manner, and
that if there is any reason why the complaint

should be

permitted to be filed, this Court will permit it.
it still remains

But that

for the complainant to prove his case.

And we feel that this Court, as any other court, should
examine its jurisdiction at all stages.
Q

Of course, the jurisdiction is open at all

times to attack, Mr. Murray, but not having been here in
1965, I don’t have the benefit of the arguments that were
made.
MR. MURRAY;
Q

I wasn’t here either, Your Honor.

From what was said, this case was not

perfunctorily treated.

Full arguments were had, and a great

deal of time was devoted to it.
MR. MURRAY:

We still feel, may it please the

Court, that Nebraska had the burden of proving facts whereby
she was. entitled to an exercise of the Court’s original
jurisdiction, and we feel that now she has had her opportunity
to prove those facts and we feel that she failed..
Q

Of course, you will go right ahead and make

your argument to demonstrate that, Mr. Murray.

07

MR. MURRAY:

There are three basic things that

we feel Nebraska failed to prove.

The first thing we feel

that she failed to prove was that Iowa violated the compact.
And basically we feel that she failed to prove that because
the proof is' that what we have done is engage in litigation
in a court of competent jurisdiction concerning the
ownership of several of these areas.

We didn't send out the

National Guard or the Corps of Game Wardens or the Highway
Patrol to move these people off these islands or off these
abandoned channels.

All we did was engage as litigation

in this litigation, sometimes as plaintiff, sometimes as
defendant, sometimes as an intervener, in the Iowa courts,
of course, because -these areas which the state claims to
own are all in Iowa, and we simply don't feel that that
was violation of the compact.
Secondly, we feel that they haven't proved a
justiciable controversy between these two states.

They

failed to prove that because Nebraska has no real abd
present interest in this matter.
Some citizens of Iowa do.
do.

Some of her citizens do.

Some non-residents of both states

But Nebraska has no interest.

She doesn't claim to own

any of these areas which Iowa now claims to own.

That was

established by interrogatories,in answers to interrogatories,
early in the pre-trial phases of the case.
/

-

■

for tl

tii

failed in her proof, that we feel that this Court should not
exercise its powers of original jurisdiction in this case.
Q

Let's assume for the moment that it were

admitted and perfectly clear that Iowa was breaching the
contract.

You would still make the same argument here as

far as disability was concerned, that Nebraska, since it
has no proprietary interest, stands to gain no dollars and
cents , has no justiciable interest in enforcing the terms
of the compact which it entered into with Iowa.
MR. MURRAY:

And has not brought herself within

the rules of parens patriae.
q

Yes.

That just the fact that it contracted

with Iowa is not enough.
MR. MURRAY:
Q

That'3 right.

That a contracting party doesn’t automatically

have standing to enforce the contract, even though he gave
consideration for it.
MR. MURRAY:

That's right.

And I can’t cite you to a case for it.

As far as

I know, this is the first..case—Mr. Holdenhauer says it's
*

a peculiar case—this is the first case that ever came before
the Court where this sort of situation exists, and X don't
believe, as far as I know, at least, there isn't any prior
case on the point.
It’s perfectly true that the State of: Iowa does

29
assert in this ease and in these cases in state court where
we think the issues should be decided that we do own the bed
of the Missouri River insofar as that bed is in .Iowa.

And

we do assert that we own certain islands# not all islands#
but certain islands which have famed over that bed#
specifically the
bod.»

islands which have formed in Iowa over that

If they formed in Nebraska, we agree that we do not

mil -them»
Also we claim to own certain abandoned channels
of tbs river in Iowa but not all of them.

And the reason for

this is that it is the law of Iowa that the state doesn’t
remain the owner of all abandoned channels.

I think a fair

statement of the law of Iowa is that that we only own
abandoned channels which were abandoned by an evulsion.

And

wherever an abandoned channel was abandoned by the process
of accretion# by the process of land forming to the shorefrom a private riparian owner, then -die private riparian
owner owns that land as accretion to his riparian shore. •
The Iowa rules 1 think are best summarised in the
case of Holman, v. Hodges in 1901 by the Iowa Supreme Court
Justice Ladd, which is cited in our brief, and the reasons
for them are fully discussed in that opinion.

This has been

the law of Icwa consistently since 1356, ten years after we
were admitted to -statehood.

The court in Iowa has never
of

30
1343 where the Iowa court has said that this is still the
law of Iowa.
^

Iowa owns the bed? Iowa owns accretions to the

bed; Iowa owns abandoned channels which were abandoned by
evulsion*
Now t Nebraska claims in this case that we signed
away our right to claim ownership of anything along the
Missouri River by operation of that common law when we
entered into the 1943 boundary compact.

This is the

equivalent of saying that the 1943 boundary compact repealed
the law# repealed the common law of Iowa, insofar as it would
apply to the Missouri River,
Wo deny that.that happened as a result of the
^

compact.

And the first reason that I would mention for our

denial is that the compact simply doesn't say that.
doesn't say anything like that.
just the opposite of that.

And it

And# in a senser it says

When Nebraska proposes that the

compact repealed the Iowa common law along the river, she
recognizes her responsibility to propose something to fill
the void which would then be left.

She proposes then that

Nebraska common law should take over and apply on both sides
of the river.
}

That's diametrically opposed to what the

compact said# because Section 2 says that the State of
Nebraska hereby cedes to the. State of Xcwa and relinquishes
jurisdiction over all land now in Nebraska but lying easterly
of said boundary, and there was a reciprocal session in the

31
Iowa enactment of the compact.

By this language we think

Nebraska said to Iowa, "Nevermore will cur sovereignty or
our jurisdiction or our land title laws extend east of the
boundary and into Iowa."
q

Contrary to what Nebraska—

Mr. Murray, the consequence of your approach

is than that the bed of the river in those parts ceded were
actually vested in the State of Iowa,
MR. MURRAY:
Q

Yes, sir.

Whereas before it has been owned by a Nebraska

riparian owner subject to—
MR. MURRAY:

We don't really agree that it was

owned by the Nebraska riparian owner.

We deny that the

Nebraska riparian owner had any vested title to it under
Nebraska law, prior to the compact,
Q
position?

Then where would you say title was in that
It wasn’t Iowa's land, was it?

MR„ MURRAY:
Q

Oh, no, no, no.

It didn’t belong to the State of Nebraska, did

it?
MR, MURRAY:

No.

What I am saying is as far as

we were concerned at least it was a property of the Nebraska
owner, but what X am saying is he had no vested title to it,
Q

Will you enlarge on that a little bit, because

I don't know what kind of a title a farmer has if it isn’t
a vested title in the context we*re talking about.

Do you

mean by that it must be to the hazards of the moving of the
river just because it happens to be located near the bank of
a river?

Is that the*—
MR. MURRAY;

I didn't quite understand that

question.
Q

I am trying to get at what kind of title you

think the farmer has to this land if it isn't a vested title
MR. MURRAY;

Nebraska made her election to become

one of those states wherein the bods of her navigable rivers
are privately owned..

In the 1906 case of Kfahead y- Turgoon

Kinkee.d v. Turge on does say the Nebraska riparian owner owns
to the thread of the stream.

The only trouble with

Kiakead is that it didn’t involve ownership of any bed of
any navigable river,

Kinkoad involved accretions which had

arisen and were in existence at the time of the case.
Therefore, we say that when the Nebraska court said i:a
Nebraska our landowners shall own to the thread of the
stream, that that was dictum because the case didn't involve
ownership of the bed of the streams.
But if you're trying to find out what Nebraska,
law is, the next best thing to a holding of the Supreme
Court of Nebraska would be dictum/» of the Supreme Court of
Nebraska.
MR. Murray;
say one more thing.

That's right.

We think that—let me

First of all, we have cited til the

Nebraska cases in our exceptions to the Special Master’s
report which could possibly be construed as creating a
vested right in the landowner to the bed of the stream.
And there is

no case in Nebraska which involves the bed of

a navigable stream.

Every case in which any remark has been

made about this .is our law, private ownership to the thread#
has involved either accretions in being or it has involved
the Platte River which is a non-navigable stream.

So# we

say -that all the statements the Nebraska court has ever made
about it are in the nature of dicta# and we agree dicta
perhaps creates the lav; of Nebraska but it doesn't create
vested rights which the Nebraska unicameral couldn’t change#
and it’s our position in this case that when the Nebraska
unicameral ceded to Iowa everything east of the new boundary,
then it was she# it was the unicameral# that was changing
the law that would be applicable to those areas, and they
were saying hereafter the lav of Iowa shall apply to them.
Nebraska says that the unicameral couldn't do that
because these landowners had vested rights in the bed of the
river.

We say no, they had r-> vested rights, and, therefore,

the Supreme Court ox Nebraska could have changed their common
law concerning ownership of their river beds, they never have,
but they could have.

And the legislature possessed, the

power to change the Nebraska law.

And, insofar as it's

applicable to 2ends east of the boundary, that’s precisely

34
what the unicameral dido
The Special Master agreed with us on this
proposition, said at page 193 of his report he sets out his
proposed rule for determining ownership of lands which have
formed since the compact since 1943»
give you some idea

of

And, by the way, no

what .*3 involved here, rows non claim*-'

to own approximately 30 areas up and down -cue river between
Sioux City and the Missouri state line.

Approximately

eight of these areas were in existence at the time the
compact was entered into, and the remaining 22 areas have
come into existence since the compact.
Mr. Moldenhauer mentioned that one case has gone
as far as the Eighth Circuit concerning the ownership of
one of these tracts of land* a tract of land which is now

involved here and included in the 30 areas which ..*.owa ciaima
to own.

And this csss was entitled in Circuit court

Tyson v. Iowa, decided in 1960.
Mr. Moldenhauer has very roughly but correctly
related the facts of Tyson.

After 1943 the river escaped

from the design channel which was west of the area, the area
being ir. Iowa.

It escaped by washing away its left bank

stabilising structures, anct ultimately the left bank moved
approximate 3.v a mile and a half into Iowa.
ight bank or

In the mean time,

remained stationary.

When the river acquired a width' of a mile and a half, ot

course it became shallow and an island arose on' the Iowa side
of the boundary but west of the thalweg of the river.

In

other words, on the Nebraska side of the thalweg but on the
Iowa side of the boundary.
Both fclie District Court and Judge Hick land and
the Circuit Court held that the island belonged to Iowa
because it had arisen over and as an accretion to tho stateowned bed of the river.
Nebraska recognises in this case that if they are
to have their construction of the compact and if they are
going to have their way, the Tyson decision must be
overruled or at least disavowed.

The Special Master

considered that proposition very carefully and concluded
that the Tyson case was right, the lav/ of the Tyson case
was valid, and that it should not be overruled and
disavowed.

It’s about that simple.

And the law which comes

out of the Tyson case, as far as we're concerned, is about
this,

that Tyson's right to accrete by Nebraska law was

limited to the state boundary, and he cannot, could not,
before the compact and cannot since the compact accrete by
Nebraska law into Iowa.
Secondly, if Tyson were to accrete into Iowa, he
could only do so under Iowa lav/.

There is a possibility

that a Nebraska landowner could accrete into jowa under Iowa
law, because Iowa recognises that the private riparian owner

36
becomes the owner of accretions which form to his high bank.
The thing that Iowa law denies is that a

private riparian

owner of any sterte,, either state, can accrete tinder the
water.

Nebraska lets -the mail accrete under -the water,

because his boundary and by Nebraska 1 ax*; is the thalweg,
and wherever the thalweg goes there goes his boundary.
not by Iowa law.

But

It inheres in the Tyson decision that the

common law of Iowa which has been in effect since 1856 is
still in effect.
It inheres in Iowa, in Tyson, that it wasn't
repealed by the compact.

And it inheres in the decisio-;)

that Iowa didn't sign away her rights to claim cwr.orsh.ip of
lands, riverbeds, and so forth, by it;: operation.
Actually the Tyson case simply follows a long line
of cases by this Court of which Ark).'
example.

There have been several

a :• v„ Tennessee

’ an

Arkansas-Tennessee oases..

The one X refer to is 246 U. S. 158.

The Special Master

quotes from that decision at page 181 of his report.

So,

the law that came out of Tyson isn't anything new; it's the
seme law that this Court has been applying for years.
Also I might mention that in order for Nebraska to
have her way about this case, the case of State of low;
Raymond by the Iowa Supreme Court in l:-33, would have tc b-v
overruled and disavowedv
Q

Was the compact pleaded in that case?

MR. MURRAY:

No,

But it inheres in the case that

the Iowa, common law is the Iowa common law.
Q

It may be that—do you think that if Nebraska

is right on the construction of the contract—-let’s assume
the Special Master is right on his construction ana your
exception is overruled, would the provision of the compact
bo a defense in a suit like the case you just mentioned?
MR. MURRAY:
Q

No, I don't think so.

You don1t.

MR. MURRAY:

I’m not sure

2

understand the

question, Your Honor.
Q

You don’t think the individual landowners have

any rights to claim under -the compact?
MR. MURRAY;
Q

Oh, sure they do.

I’m sorry if I—

Let’s assume that the Master is right on his

construction of the compact.
MR. MURRAY:
Q

Yes.

Then would Iowa lose its suits against these

individual landowners ?
MR. MURRAY:
Q

No.

Just some of them,

Has the compact ever been raised in.any of

those Iowa suits in court?

Have compact rights ever been

asserted by private landowners?
MR. MURRAY:

Tyson’s secondary position, I would

say, in the Tyson case, was that the compact didn't affect

38

his rights,
0

So, in a manner of speaking he was raising

the compact, but it was in a negative manner.

Should the

compact be available to him?
MU. MURRAYs

It's available to everybody that

has an interest in those river lands and the ownership of
them.
Q

If the Special Master is right in his

construction of the compact, if you were the lawyer for
Tyson., wouldn’t you plead it?
MR. MURRAYs

Yes.

But I’d get beat because -Tyson

never did have any right to accrete into Iowa and the
compact doesn't create that right in him either.
Q

Well, the Master held that.

MR, MURRAY:
0

Yes.

The Master agrees with you in that respect.

MR. MURRAY:

And that's the part of the Master's

report that we do not accept to.
Q

But Nebraska does.

MR. MURRAY:

Nebraska accepts to that»

My time is almost up, and I haven't gotten even
to our exception, which is to the Special Master's proposed
rule for determination of ownership of the areas which had
formed prior to '1943 and which ware in existence at that
time.

We feel the Master is wrong'about that rule because

39
he—
MR. CJHXJ8F JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll extend you about

three more minutes and enlarge your friend's time
accordingly.

We have taken up a good deal of your time.

So, you proceed another three minutes.
MR. MURRAY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

The effect

of the Special Master's rule for the pre-1943 areas is to
destroy utterly the law which we have always known as the
law of boundaries or as the law cf accretion.
supplants another law in place of it.

And he

Into the ash can

under the Special Master's proposed rule for the pre-1943
areas goes the presumption in favor of accretion and against
evulsion.

Under the Special Master's rule, Iowa would be

deprived of the benefit of that presumption which this
Court recognises and as far as I know every court that ever
had an opportunity recognizes.
He destroys the presumption in favor of the
permanency of boundaries which this Court utilised in the
former case of Nebraska v. Iowa.

And what this Court said

in substance, what is more natural when people are dividing
land to use a river as a boundary.
•Q

That's the same thing as the presumption in

favor of accretion.
MR. MURRAY:
the same, yes.

Practically the same.

The result is

What happens under the Specie.! Master5 js rule to
the proposition that a state is suing another state for
violation o£ anything, it must prove her case by clear and
convincing evidence.

It's gone and what happens to the rule

that any presumption must be overcome by clear and
convincing evidence?

The Special Master's rule simply

wipes out all those things which we have thought tor years
were the law o£ accretion and the law of boundaries and puts
the thing entirely on one basis as to the areas for prior
to 1943, and that basis is, Was there a title in Nebraska
to it as of 1943?
My time is up and I thank you very much,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Murray.,

Mr. Moldenhauer, that will give you ruven. minute,::
if you think you need it.
REBUTTAL BY MR. MOLDEMIAUER
MR. M0IJDEN1IAUER:

May it please the Count:

One thing that we think it * u important to analyse
is a fact which apparently Iowa has overlooked, and that is
that when they entered into the compact, they changed the
laws along the river to a fixed boundary.

All ana previous

riparian laws; were based upon the face that when a person is
subject to having his property taken away by movement of the
rivor, he is subject to having it added to, as the -river
goes the other way, and that is the rationale for all of those

4.1

arguments.

There isn't going to be any decision which says

you carr i accrete across a state line, and usually where
you have a movable boundary because a movable boundary is
the same for the states as it is for the private riparian
owners.

But now we've changed the situation.

We entered

into a compact with a fixed line, and 1 think that requires
an analysis then; is the rationale still there?
Iowa cites all these early
says this has always been the common
dispute that.

In those situations

we can't dispute that.

rested.

And X think we've quoted it in the brief somewhere,

counsel stated originally that initially they were going to
rely on the presumption of gradual movement, of the river
into its present location.

So, anything on the eastern or
■ *

left bank side would be in Iowa.
At the same time in interrogatories in this case
Iowa admitted that she ruled that a, canal was dug in
Nebraska in 1933 in that location, and yet she- is relying
on the presumptions, and the evidence in this case, in the
Schemmel case, shows a canal a mile long, placing the river
in the design channel along with other movements by dik
and revetments in the Scheme! area.

But Iowa, by being

able to utilize the presumption puts that tremendous Burden
on the landowner of coming back in and having to establish
how the river got there in the past.

This meant old

documents, old witnesses, evidence is gone? it has been lost
or destroyed; and the Corps of Engineers itself was not a
record-keeping body, and many of its records were thrown
away.

So, it puts the landowner, if he's going to rebut

that presumption, in an extremely difficult position
extremely expensive position.

• " an

A tremdnous amount of time

and effort has been spent in getting evidence in this case.
Very few farmers could afford that type; of litigation
defense of that type of litigation.

We say when Iowa said

in the compact that titles will be good, and again we have

to determine which ones.

But when she says they're good,

that doesn't mean that we’re .going to put you now, landowner,
over in Iowa and although she admits they're good, she can
attack your title at any time and put that tremendous burden
upon you to rebut all the presumptions and cere in and
establish that you've got a good title.

We don't think than

we sent our citizens over there to give them a forum which
changes the jurisdiction and from the change in jurisdiction
a change of ownership followed.
When Iowa said tit3.es good in Nebraska will be
good in Iowa, we said had to apply to the bed also and both
sides, because there were many places where both sides of
that bed were in Nebraska.

She didn't say, ''We're going

to accept that title and take the title of the beet.'

So.

by saying Iowa law applies, Iowa lav/ is that Iowa err. a the
bed; it's negating completely Iowa's agreement that
to that part, good in Nebraska, would he ;:y od iv< low a
Let me conclude then by saying that Kebrca
here as a contracting party with a right to enforce the
compact.

Iowa apparently only wants to-enforce Sect;; or

of the compact.

But we say that if only Section 1 is valid,

then we have lost the complete consideration for the
remainder of our bargain.

We feel that the compact should be

read in the manner in which it was intended in 3.943 and where
great object can be seen it should be effectuated, and that

was to settle and lay to rest all of these problems which
existed along the Missouri River.
