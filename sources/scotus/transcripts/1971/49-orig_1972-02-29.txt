MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments next

in No. 49 Original, the State of Illinois against the City of
Milwaukee and others.
Mr. Herxdg, you may proceed whenever you?re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED F. HER20G, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. HERZOG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This is a motion by the Stato of Illinois ashing this
Court for leave to file a bill of complaint against various
Wisconsin municipalities, including and foremost the City of
Milwaukee which, as you know quite well, contains within its
boundaries the greatest concentration of people and industry in
the. State of Wisconsin.
Now, the bill of complaint is quite simple.

It merely

charges that huge amounts of raw sewage and inaequately
treated sewage are dumped every day into the waters of Lake
Michigan; that these waters thereby become contaminated, and
that these polluted waters find their way into the Illinois
territory where they seve:

.

san severely, endanger

the life and health-of many residents of the State of Illinois.
Actually, in this parti cular instance, tire Department
of Natural Resources of the State of Wisconsin, which is the
agency which deals with water pollution matters in the State of

Wisconsin!, has estimated that 200 million gallons a day *rv~ 200
million gallons a day in the Milwarhas eraa alone are discharged
into the waters of Lake Michigan.

How, this is not a small

concerned with it.
We in Illinois — I must put here the matter straight
in this instance

have actually done everyth!

wipe out pollution.

Of course there are soma

remaining, but it was through the efforts of our it! rrruay
General, who is seated next to me here, that we have accomplished
that.
And I might say here in this instance that we cannot
tolerate and suffer that such an epidemic of .
lurks behind every wave which really finds its way into the
Illinois region.

We are familiar, unfortunatelyin Illinois

with such an epidemic.

In the 1880’s the City of Chicago

dumped raw sewage into Lake Michigan.

The consequence was one

of the severest typhoid epidemics which ever hit the city of
Chicago, which hit the population of Oivlhtgo.
And it was at that time that the Chicago Sanitary
District was• created, where the flow of the rivers, m you
might know, is'reversed, ana whore nothing

Under these circumstances # I respectfully suggest
that if you have such a clash of sovereign interests# the
exercise of truly original jurisdiction approaches the
constitutional mandate# I might even say it becomes mandatory
here in this instance.
We had an example here# too# in the case of Missouri

jurisdiction was exercised.
Q

Mr. Herzog#

And there the original

6
MR. HERZOGs
Q

Yes?

from a pollution point of view, is the way

that Waukegan and Wilmette and Winnetka handle their raw sewage
materially different from the way that Kenosha and Racine and
Milwaukee handle theirs?
MR, HERZOG;

Yes, they handle it presently different.

First of all, as far as Wilmette is concerned, it belongs to
the area of the Chicago Metropolitan Sanitary District, hence
there an extensive treatment is provided and it doesn't go into
Lake Michigan.
But as far as Waukegan is concerned, and the
communities in the North Shore Sanitary District, they are
presently under orders of our Pollution Control Board, of our
Water Pollution Control Board not to emit any sewage into Lake
Michigan,

So they do handle it differently,
As 1 said, due to our efforts and the persistent

efforts which we have made in this field.
Now, being here a class of inter-controversy involving
sovereign, interests, I have indicated that really original
jurisdiction is almost mandatory in this instance.

However,

even if we elevate form over substance in this instance and
say, Well, the complaint is really not directed officially
against the State of Wisconsin, nevertheless I can only re­
emphasise again that these State agencies and these municipal
corporations — and I might say that one of the agencies is

7
actually a State agency, namely ths Milwaukee Sewerage
Commission of the County of Milwaukee, where the

• are

appointed by the Governor of the State of Wisconsin,
Butt as 1 said, even if v;e look at these municipali­
ties, nevertheless they are the bearers of sovereign interest.
they carry .out within their territory the police power of fch
State of Wisconsin in the field of public health.
The question has been asked by this Courts

if the

Court exercises jurisdiction, what law would apply?
Well, we submit here- that Federal common law must
apply in such an instance.

It must apply because the mare

idea of sovereignty demands the application of such a law.
It cannot be a State law, although maybe the Federal Court
here can freely draw upon State resources of law. But the law
which is applied is Federal law.

A Federal law which has to

take into consideration the quality of the sovereigns which are
involved, and has to take into consideration the backdrop of
various Federal laws which will come into play.
Q

Mr. Herzog, is Congress free to specify the

law or to fashion the law applicable in a suit like this?
MR. HERZOG*

Congress is free, but I’m sorry to say,

and I will quote later on from the- congressional report here
in this instance, that Congress has actually delegated the
power here to the various States, as far as water quality
standards are concerned.

8
Frankly, in my humble opinion, this is a drawback
in this instance? that it is Isit to the individual States to
control even water pollution and to control it, and wheref
actually, in these interstate disputes, their sovereign
interests clash with each other.
Q

Well, are we — is this Court free, despite the

decision of Congress, to leave this matter to the State our­
selves to fashion a Federal standard that would govern in this
case?
MR. HERZOG:

No, Mr. Justice Whit®, I really believe

here in this instance that under the constitutional, mandate of
Article III, where the Court must really hear controversies
which are in fact between States

,

this Court must fashion its

own laws, in case —
Q

Regardless of what Congress says?

MR. HERZOG: Regardless here in this instance of
Congress — unless there is an overriding law of Congress which
says that in this instance Federal standards, Federal principles
must be applied? which hasn't been the case here.
Q

And if Congress said that Federal. law.;- is: to

govern cases like this, but this Court should borrow State law
*

in deciding the case, could you — would we be bound to-follow
that directive?
MR. HERZOGS

Well, in this instance, frankly, 1

question whether Congress can tell this Court what law to apply

in cases of original jurisdiction to be decided upon the
Article III of the Const!tution.

Well, let's ass.tetto that it can, just for the

MR. BERSOG:
matter.

No.

Has it?

It hasn't really acted in this

It hasn't really, as far as the Federal law is

concerned, it left to the individual States, really, the
resolution of the problem.

And it provided eventually, if

the State asked for an interstate enforcement conference, arc.
there it wasn't said what law should re. applied here, or
what rule should be applied here.

So it was all left up

handing in the air, and frankly this is the whole drawback of •
these interstate enforcement conferences.
They haven't worked, and I will indicate why they
haven81 worked.
But, be that as it may, we respectfully submit here
that this is -really a controversy between sovereigns, as I have
repeatedly mentioned, and the controversy here in this instance
which really pertains to the use of water.

And if we have such

a controversy pertaining to the use of water, Mr. Justice

?
Brandeis here, speaking for this Court in the

The Water Act of 1889 wed at this time in existence.
The Rivers and Harbors: Act was in existence, and actually
the harbor master of New York at that time gave to the City of
Hew York the express? permission to dump in the places where
they dumped.

Nevertheless here this Court took jurisdiction

and this Court decided here in this particular instance that
the action was improper.

X might say her© that much is made by the defendants
of the fact here that there is that Water Quality Act of 1955
for the Federal Pollution Control Act which provides for an
enforcement conference as a retaedy by the Attorney General
of the United States if requested by the

administrator,

originally by the Secretary of the Interior, now by the

11
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,
First of all, let me emphasise that this remedy is
not a remedy which is given to the State.

It is a remedy which

is solely in the discretion of the Federal Government.

And

during 22 years there was one single case where the Attorney
*

General actually utilized that remedy, apparently wasn’t asked
here either by the Secretary of the Interior or by- the Adminis-A
tor of the Environmental Agency.
And what did this Administrator say about the* effec­
tiveness of that•remedy which he is supposedly and allegedly
provided here in the Federal law?
didn't work at all.

He simply said that it

We have pointed it out in our brief.

I want to quote from a letter to Representative
Albert, the Speaker of the House.

It says:

This major support

o£ pollution control of interstate waters have not proved
sufficiently strong and effective,
Now, we are not really the persons who say that these
remedies have not proved effective, it was the U. S. Senate
who so held on November 2nd, 1971, barely three months ago,
there on November 2nd when they passed unanimously, 86 to 0,
a new Act — the House hasn't acted upon it — there the
Committee on Public Works, after two years of study on the
Federal water Pollution Control Program, and I am quoting:
"concludes that the national effort to abate and control water
pollution is inadequate in every vital aspect.

Rivers, lakes,

12
and streams are being used to dispose of man's waste rather
than to support man’s life and health.

And the use of any

river, lake, stream, or ocean as a waste treatment system is
unacceptable.
Arad they said this was due to the time schedule;' for
abatement were slipping away because of failure to enfort

lack

of effluent controls and disputes over Federal-State standards.
This is the words, you might say, of Senator ;.4uskie,
who reported here this bill in behalf of the Committe,* on Public
Works.
Now, what are the facts here of the Michigan State
Enforcement Conference?

It was the State of Illirois as

only State which, in 1967, asked for that convening of the
conference because we were deathly afraid of these wastes which
come every day into the State of Illinois. We ore afraid
because all our efforts would

beset to naugIt, it would be

futile, if we couldn’t act here in this instance against the
neighboring States,
And therefore we asked for the ;onvening of the
conference.

This is unlike, I might say, Ohio vs. Wyandotte,

where there was a Lake Erie Conference v-hich was in existence
only for one year before the suit was filed.
In 868 the first conference met, there were highsounding declarations that the States should cooperate in the
pollution control abatement programs, deadlines were set,

13
operation schedules wars provided»

But what canta of it?

In 1969 the second conference met, and again there
were broken deadlines, some of the municipalities didn't even
start,

As a matter of fact, one of the municipalities here

involved has a 196? deadline to enlarge their sewage, treatment
facilities.

They have still, not complied with this schedule.

In 1970, the third conference met, and it met
significantly in the City of Milwaukee, because the chairman
of the conference, who was a Federal official,

turned to the

representative of the State of Wisconsin, and I'm quoting what
he said;
“But the point is that the biggest city in your State,
Milwaukee, is one that discharges into Lake Michigan the
water that we have a real high priority to protect is in real
violation of this conference recommendation."
They are more than two years late on this inspection
of the effluent, and the lack of putting out this inspection
means that pollutants go in to the lake.
bald facts, as I see them.

Now, these are the

The largest city in the State is

not disinfecting its effluent.
Well, when they learned of this -Q

Mr. Herzog, doesn't the STate of Illinois have

any remedy under the existing Federal law for these broken
deadlines?
MR. HEREOGs

No, we have no such remedy.

We can't

14
go to the Federal Conference, we can eventually ask for a
hearing, but then after the hearing — and by the way I might
say that contrary to what is stated in the respondent's brief,
we would not have a remedy under the Administrative Review Act f
because under the Administrative Review Act such remedy would
not be in existence if a decision is made by a representative
body.

I think it is Section 7 of the Administrative Review Act.
We would not have a remedy.

An a matter of ’fact,

we have no remedy under the State law, unlike Ohio vs. Wyandotte,
we could not go into the State of Illinois. 'Yes, we could sue
them under a long-time statute? how ara w going to enforce?
Particularly in an injunctive decree against Milwaukee,
against the sovereign agency of another State.

Yes, we

recognise that the same is true -with the Federal Court.

We do

not qualify as a citizen under the diversity proceeding,
which is recognized also by this Court in the Wyandotte case.
We could not —- yes, we could go as suggested, and
I can only take the suggestion as almost facetious, that we
should go to the Department of Natural Resources of Wisconsin
and ask for relief.

This is as if you would say here the

sheep should go to the wolf and ask here to mete out justice
among them.

This is the very person

those are the very

agencies which tolerate that condition here, and what did —*
by the way, as far as the enforcement conference is concerned,
what did Wisconsin say when the conference members said;

But

15
you have changed these deadlines mi'.,

orally?

They said:

Well; it*» true we did so, out we consulted the Federal Water
Quality Administration; and then they ray here, and this is
characteristic, this is a quotation from their report to the
conference s

It should be further noted that there are no

published rules or regulations or guidelines that have been
promulgated by the Department of the Interior to give specific
guidance and details on how this whole area of joint enforcement
of standards and recommendations should be administered.
We consider the lack of such rule to be a substantial
weakness in conference procedures.

That*s the whole works.

They really denigrate here the whole procedure as such, and
nothing is left.
If it please this Court here, this is not the question,
as I have said, of property, this is a question literally, and
this is not high-sounding oratory, this is a question of human
lives which are involved.

We might, be saying we are equally

concerned with the lives of the citizens of Wisconsin, but
we have known about this humane concern for the Wisconsin
residents cannot be translated by us into regression; but it
can be translated by us into regression as far as the residents
of the State of Illinois are concerned.
And we are under a duty and the Federal Water Quality
Act places a responsibility for action foremost in the States.
This is the constant these of the Federal Water Quality Act.

16
In the policy statement,, that even in the statement where it
deals with the enforcement provisions, which deals with the
conference, there it says State action shall not be displaced
by action of the Federal Government, unless a court order has
been issued, which of course has not been done here,
So, under these circumstances, where there is no other
remedy available to us, at least no other reasonable remedy,
and where we surely are not going to subject our sovereign.
interests to an administrative agency of the State off Wisconsin,
arid where sovereign interests prevail, 1 must submit that the
exercise of original jurisdiction is the only thing which is
left.

Every day which goes by causes irreparable harm.

And

to postpone the deadlines simply would not do any more.
We have waited three years, four years, now five
years.

And, by the way, the situation still hasn't been

corrected.

In the latest brief of the Milwaukee Sewerage

Commission, on page 6, at the bottom of the page they talk of
one of their treatment plants and says

primary treatment is

operative at the other.
You know what this means in the parlance of the
health authorities?

Primary treatment means that the solids

merely are taken out, which is nothing, absolutely nothing,
as far as health is concerned.
Secondary treatment is demanded where at least 90,
85 or 90 percent of the solids are removed, and nowadays we

.17

have recognised that even secondary treatment in many instances
is not sufficient.
I respectfully urge this Court to exercise
jurisdiction, unlike Wyandotte vs. Ohio, fchi
private individuals are involved, this is a suit between
sovereigns? and, unlike Wyandotte, no other remedy, at least
technical remedy, is available to the

of Illinois which

t*

will prevent irreparable harm.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Herzog.

Mr. Slater.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY G. SLATER, ESQ.,,
OH BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS
MR. SLATER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

please;
I do not propose to get into any controversy with the
State of Illinois on a factual demonstration.

We may differ

sharply, but I do not think this is the forum where that should
be presented.
This matter, I think, has also been somewhat
exaggerated in the presentation that has been made, and we ought
to very briefly look at the background here to ascertain just
what the situation is.
X should like to also say, in defense of my City,
we are a progressive, we are a good city, and we respect the
rights of our citizens and the rights of other citizens, and we

18
do what is absolutely at our disposal to

that situati

obtain.
Q

Well, what about these deadlines, Mr. Slater?

MR, SLATER • The only deadline fcfc

:

Chief Justice, is the deadline that is promulgated by the
State Department of Natural Resources.

I believe this was

promulgated in 1970, and they reviewed this situation in an
impartial, noncontroversial or partisan manner, and determined
that the City of Milwaukee shall have until 1977 to make these
broad and overwhelming changes in the sewer system and in the
manner of handling sewage.
Now, I should like to state here that the State
Department of Natural Resources is created under Wisconsin
statutes.

it is a quasi-judicial body.

It is impartial.

It has the same respect for Illinois as it does for Wisconsin.
And this body has promulgated orders after making findings and.
has said what I have just stated, namely, that we shall have
until 1977 to make these effective changes.
Q

Well, that8s, of course,•a unilateral action

on the part of Wisconsin. Were there any deadlines in the
interstate conference? ■
MR. SLATER!
6.0

Mr. Chief Justice, I know of none.

I

not even know that Illinois complained against that dead­

line.

And I should also like to state that this conference

cam® about in 1967, the then Governor of Illinois asked for

19
this conference from the United States Secretary of Interior.
And this conference was called.

And we had four participating

ad Michigan, Indiana, Illinois,

3

And they all carae on a cooperative basis to effectuate a
remedy for this important problem.
Now, this problem didn’t come overnight? it came over
a long period of years, and, by the same token, it cannot ba
solved overnight, even though every municipality, every State,
and every individual would like to solve the problem of
pollution in a quick and easy and effective manner.
Q

Mr. Slater, that was 1967 you said?

MR. SLATER: The conference was first asked for, Mr.
Justice, in 1967? it was convened in 1968, in January 1968.
It went cn for & couple of months and, as a result of that,
the State Department of Natural Resources — and I don’t think
it is fair to make this an agent of the City of Milwaukee.
It is an administrative agency of the State of Wisconsin.
Q

Let me get back to my question. That was 1967?

MR. SLATER:
Q

That is correct.

And now you are proferring, I think, 1977 as

the date? that’s a full decade.
MR. SLATER:

Let me explain, Mr, Chief Justice, why
rates ver^

effectively that the groat pressing circumstances which have
been

dramatically displayed here today are not exactly in that.

20

status.
But let me get to this point.
this correction procedure?

What is involved in

.The direction that this order takes

is that the City of Milwaukee will have to separate its
combined sanitary and storm sewers.
Now, this, as we understand from our own engineering
instruments, and we think they're fair, would take, over-all,
approximately a half a billion dollars? $300 million would have
to come from local taxation? $200 million would have to come
from property owners who would have to make the necessary
and essential improvements to complement that which the City
of Milwaukee does.
Now, it does not take any stretch of the imagination ,
that no municipality today, or perhaps in the immediate future,
is going to be in a position to formulate a financial program
that is going to permit these overwhelming expenditures.
We8re doing our job, we're trying to meat the situation.
But how do you raise $300 million through local taxation, when
you’re already burdened with the day-to-day operations of your
own municipal government and with the social programs
essential to a number of people in order to carry out their
municipal operations?
So, when you look at that situation and recognise
that that type of money and the burden of doing the mechanical
work itself, and the necessary manpower which will accomplish

21
it# is sc, great,, i: must respectfully suggest, Mr. Justice#
that 197? does not appear to be unreasonable.
Now ~
Q

Bow much has been done in the five years?

which already constitutes a financial burlen.

Mow, let me also point out this;
practical considerations.

there are the

looioa you have a special master

appointed, we9re not determining whether or not there si
corrections.

1 think that's already been determined by the

orders of the Department of 'Matura! Jiasotsrcss, . flat is the
special master going to address himself to!
He's going to have to address himself to the very
problems that we're talking about, because, in order to make
him — we would want to comply with an order, but how does a
city of the else of Milwaukee, with a substantial debt already
and with a maximum debt fixed by the Constitution, go out and
raise this kind of money'?
What we have to do is look to the Federal .Government
for assistance, for cooperation, and to grant it.

How, short

of that, 1 don’t know where a special master will be able to
accomplish any more.
If this was a case to determine what is the degree
of pollution? what is the city’s reaction to it? perhaps
the special master could play a role.

But let me day this,

the Department of Matura1 Resources has issued these orders.
We have not appealed from them. These orders stand.
There’s been no delay.

If we were looking for a

delay, we could have had reviews .’of these orders.

But in this case X do not think that that is true.
I think there is one* side, and I'm trying to explain to the
Court just what it is.

And that side is simply this t

did have a conference *

The Congress has set up the machinery

for this conference.

You

It was held in good faith.

Now, if the Department of Natural Resources, after
this conference and after all the review, had done nothing,
1 would say Illinois would have reason to complain.
But the Department of Natural Resources has already
demonstrated its impartiality and its good faith.

How?

By

issuing the very orders that have been issued against the
City of Milwaukee, against Racine, against Kenosha, and against
others.
Q

Well, as far as the conference goes, I followed

all of them, I think there are about 57 up until last year,
and then I gave up because there were so many other things
happening.

But I didn't find but one that had resulted in

anything being accomplished.

Has anything happened, do you

25
know?

Have you followed those 57?

MR. SLATER:
own.

I have not.

1 am concerned about our •

Q

Well, where is the bite in the conference?

Isn't it more or less just a get-together and having a few
drinks and talk things over?
MR. SLATER:

I do not believe so.

so for this reason,- Mr. Justice:

X do not believe

The State Department of

Natural Resources can impose very heavy fines against anybody

Q

Oh, I'm not talking about that.;

the interstate conference.
MR. SLATER: I must confess I did not participate.
3'. don't know how they were run.

I do know the results of the

conference was the promulgation of orders that I've alreadyalluded to*

And this is all that I can say about them, because

we are not the State of Wisconsin, and I say this because
Illinois has argued that this is a contest between the State of
Illinois and the State of Wisconsin.

It doesn't fit in trying

to gat this case away from the very excellent constructive rule
in the Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemical case.

But that's not the

fact.
Wow, why didn't Illinois bring Wisconsin, in the State
of Wisconsin, I'm speaking of; and this is my own observation.
They did not bring them in because they found that the State of

26
Wisconsin was cooperating very beautifully with Illinois»
Whey had this conference, they aid issue these orders, these
orders are directed against the municipalities..

Now, what mors

can Wisconsin do?
Wisconsin has —
Q

Are you suggesting, Mr. Slater, that there is no

barrier to joining, appropriately joining the State of Wisconsin
here?
MR. SLATERs

Mr. Chief Justice, I am not permitted to

speak for the State of Wisconsin, I do not have that right.

I

would say this, that Illinois chose the parties that they
wanted to bring in this action. They chose not to bring the
State of Wisconsin, perhaps for two reasons. I can offer a
.if
second reason; they may have felt that/the State of Wisconsin
cam® in there might be some kind of a cross-complaint against
some of the municipalities in Illinois.

And maybe that v?as

one of the reasons.
I am purely' conjecturing on that point. But I do
say that when the argument is made here that this is against
the State of Wisconsin, it is not; it is against municipal
corporations, and you're just one small step away from a private
corporation. And so you have exactly the same situation here

Mr» Slater, on the -failure to join the State of

Wisconsin, one reason i L<

' MR, SLATER:

Well, that’s correct»

Tho state of

to try and correct the situation.
But, having put Wisconsin out of this litigation for
the moment, does hot this bring our situation squarely within
I

the Wyandotte Chemical case, which was issu
year ago?

n.h a

And there is nothing new in this situation which

should emphasise this case as a distinction against the
position that was made in their case.
That is our position, and we have tried to present it

Mr. Slateri, if the State Commission in Wisconsin

power of that Commission to either direct Milwaukee and the
other municipalities to stop dumping sewage; or want?

you suggest what their powers are?
MR. SLATERt

Mr. Chief Justice, are you speaking about

the State Department of Natural Resources?
Q

Yes.

MR. SLATERs

I would think that the State Department

of Natural Resources felt that we were not showing good faith,
and the response which they had a reasonable right to anticipate,
they could gc into court and deal with us accordingly.

MR. SLATER?

Oh, yas, Mr. Chief Justice, I assume

that they could do that under the broad powers that they have
under Chapter 144 of the Wisconsin Statutes.

Yes, 1 would

have to answer yes.
At least that9s my observation.
Q

But you say they9d have to go into court to

enforce any —MR. SLATERs That is right, Mr. Justice, —

— order to make that right?

MR. SLATER:

— because* the State Department of

Natural Resources is not a judicial body, it is a guasi-judicdal
body, it*s primarily administrative and it would; have to act
through the Attorney General of the Stats of 'Wisconsin.

And have to go into a court?

MR. SLATER? That is correct.

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. HERZOGs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courti
About this huge expenditure of money.

Let me quote

only here one instance from the conference, the third conference,
which took place in 1970.

There the question arose?

how much

it would cost to disinfect the sewerage, meaning get the
bacteria, out, the deadly bacteria out frora the sewage.

And

the man that represented the Department of Natural Resources
said $6 million.

Whereupon, all the conferees said?

My God,

That is the point, Mr* Flanders, if the peopls in the area
Seel perfectly comfortable paying $30 0 month for an electric
bill and $20 a month for a telephone bill, and get excited
when they have to pay five or sin dollars for a water bill and
treat their effluent, we are going to still be in trouble»

■And this is the basic problem*

You might be encouraged to note that some of

years without anything happening.

Well, I might say that the utmost glaring

example is the Potomac River conference, which was called in
August 22nd, 1957.

happened in this instance.
