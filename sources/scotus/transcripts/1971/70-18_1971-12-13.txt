MR, CH1SF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

in No, 18, Ho© against Wade,
Mrs, Weddington, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
OHM* ARGUMENT OF MRS, SARAH R. WBDBXNGTON,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS, «EDDINGTON?

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

pleas© the Courts
The instant case is a direct appeal from & decision
of the United States District Corn.*!: for the Northern District
of Texas.
The court declared the Texas abortion law to he
unconstitutional for two reasons?

first, that the law was
r

impermissibly vague? and, second, that it violated a woman’s
right to determine to continue or terminate a pregnancy.
Although the court granted declaratory relief, the
court denied appellants’ request for injunctive relief.
The Texas law in question permits abortions to be performed
only in instances where it is for the purpose of saving the
life of the woman.
The case originated with the filing of two separate
complaints.

The first being filed on behalf of Jan® Roe, an

unmarried pregnant girl, and the second being filed on behalf
of John and: Mary Doe, a married couple.

4
Jane Ros, the pregnant woman, had gone to several
Dallas physicians seeking an abortion, brat had been refused
care because of the Texas law»
She filed suit cn behalf of herself and all of those
women who have in the past, at that present time, or in the
future would seek termination of a pregnancy®
la her affidavit she did state soma of: the reasons
that she desired an abortion at the time she sought one.
But, contrary to the contentions of appelle©, she continued to
desire tho abortion, and it wa© not only at the» time she sought
the abortion that her desire was to terminate the pregnancy*
Q

Khan this case was in the District Court, the

case of Vuifcch against the United States had not been decided
here, had it?
MRS. WEDDINGTONs
Q

That11© correct.

Do you think that has disposed of some of the

questions raised now?
MRS. WEDDINGTONs

Your Honor, 1 do not.

In the Valtch

decision, this Court was working with a statute which provided
that an abortion could be performed for reasons of health or
life.

Our Texas statute provides an abortion only where it is

for the purpose of saving the life of the woman.
Since the Vuitch decision was rendered, the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals, which is our highest court of
criminal jurisdiction, has held that the Texas law is not vague.

citing the Vuitch decision; but saying that tbs Cessna law is
more definite* than the

D. c.

lax?.

So, obviously, the Court of

Criminal Appeals doesn’t feel that the two are the same.
And in the Vuitch decision, the Justices of this
Court emphasised continuously that a doctor, as a matter of
routine, works with the problem of what is bast for the health
of his patients»
We submit that a doctor is not used to being
restricted to acting only when it's for the purpose of saving
the life of the woman, and that health is a continuum which
runs into life? and a doctor in our Stair does not know whether
he can perform an abortion only when death is imminent or when
the woman's life would be shortened»

He dees not know if -the

death must .fee certain, or if it could be an increase in
probability of her death.
So here in the District, doctors are able to exercise
their normal matter of judgment, whether or not the health of
a woman, mental or physical, would be affected.

But in Texas

we tell a doctor that unless he can decide whether it's
necessary for the purpose of saving her life, and for no other
reason, that he is subject to criminal sanction.
X think it's important to hot©' the range of problems
that could be presented to a doctor.
cited the instance of suicide.

The Court, for example,

t£ a woman comes: in, alleging

that she will commit suicide, is it tbs?n necessary for him to

o
do, or can he do an abortion for the purpose of saving her
life, or is that a situation where he has to have something

more?
I think all of those questions cannot be answered at
this point»
This brings up the married couple in our case; the
woman in that case had a neural-chemical condition.

Her

doctor had advised her not to get pregnant, and not to take
the birth control pills.

She was using alternative means of

birth control, font sh© and her husband ware fearful that she
would become pregnant and that although the neural-chemical
condition would impair her health, there was —» evidently her
doctor did not feel that she would die if she continued the
pregnancy, and certainly they were very concerned about the
effect of th© statute and her physician seemed uncertain
about its implication.
The doctors in our State continue to feel that ouir
law is vague.

Certainly, we introduced affidavits in the lower

court to that effect.

Since the time of the lower court,

ruling» the District Attorney in Texas has said that he will —
that ho considers the Federal Court decision there not to foe
binding, and we do have a letter from him? as the first thing
in our Appendix to th© Brief.

and even after the Vuitch decision do not feel free to perform
abortions, and instead 72P women in the first nine months
after the decision went to New York for an abortion»

Texas

woman are coining here.
Xt*s so often the poor and the disadvantaged in Texas
who are not able to escape the effect of the law.

Certainly

there are massy Texas wesson who are affected, because our
doctors still feel uncertain about the impact of the law, even
in light of the Vuitch decision*

Well, then, of course, Mrs. Waddington, you make

many additional constitutional attacks on the Texas statute and 'only one was before us in the Vuiteh ease —
MRS. WEDD1NGTOZIs
Q

Yes, Your Honor, wo do.

• only the claim of constitutional vagueness,

that the Court explicitly didn41 —
MRS. WBDDINGTGNs

Q
other claims.

Did not deal with it.

- deal with the other claim.

You make many

Of course, before you get to any of those,

their© are a good many thresholds of questions, are there not,
to get to your decision?
MSS. WEDDXN3T0Ns

Yes, Year Honor,there are.

2 think it8s of course important to point out to the
Court that in my reading of Younger va. Harris and the companion
cases, all the Court was concerned about in those cases was
a situation where there was an attempt to interfere with the'

0'

pending State erixnin al prosecution.
In this case, as I pointed out, the original parties
to this matter are women, and in one case the husband, the
woman certainly are not subject to prosecution in the State of
Texas.

They are — it is impossible for them to stand in the

criminal dock and litigate their interests.

They cam© seeking

injunctive relief, but it was not against pending State
criminal prosecution®.

They were not even aware of the

prosecution against Dr. Hallford*
Q

Could they, under Texas law, be charged as

accomplices
MRS„ WED&XNSTONs
Q

Mo, Your Honor.

— or as co-conspirators or anything like that?

MRS. WEDDXNGTONs Ho.

We have express

Texas cases.

i

In on© situation, Woodrow vs. State, an 1880 case, the woman
had taken a potion to indue® abortion, end the Texas court,
©pacifically said that the woman is guilty of no crime, oven
in that situation j and that in fact she is the victim of our
law.
There is no declaratory relief available for these
plaintiffs.

Their only forum was the Federal Court, and it

was to those courts that they turned.
Q

Your three plaintiffs here, representing classes,

MRS. HEDDZMGTOlt!
Cl

Yes, sir.

And the doctor —

— shown that*, it would b© injurious to the

wife’s health to have a child, and also injurious to her
health to use the most efficient form of birth control.
MRS. WEDDINGTON2
Q

Yes.

And then, third, the physician —

MRS. WEDDXNGTONs Yes, but —
Q

— who is under indictment or was at the time

of this complaint?
.MRS. WEDDIWGTON2
Q

Yes.

All right.

MRS. WEDDXKGTOH?

The physician intervened after the

order was entered granting Jane Roe a three-judge court, and
he intervened again, asking only that future prosecution
under the law be enjoined.

He did not ask any relief of the

court, relating to his pending State criminal prosecution.
He did specifically in his complaint reserve the
right to ask for future relief, but that was never cone, and
certainly, in the future, if he were to ask for relief, the
court would have the guidance of Younger vs. Karris and companion

10
cases»
But there was in no way any request for any action
to interfere with the pending criminal prosecutions then in
process.
As to —* there is an allegation that the question is
moot, since the woman has now had — has carried the pregnancy
to term»

And I think it is important to realise that there are

several important aspects

in

which this cans differs from the

case that the courts might usually fee presented»
First, the case is different in the nature of the
interest which is involved, and in the extent to which
personal determination is undermined by this statute? the
effect that it has on women.
Second, it is unique in the type of injury that’s
presented. Certainly there are some injuries that can be
compensated, and most last over a sufficient period of time
for the courts to litigate the interest,.

But in this case, a

progressing pregnancy does not suspend itself in order to give
the time ■-*» the courts time to act.
her suit as soon as

i

Certainly Jan© Roe brought

knew she was pregnant, as'soon as she

had sought an abortion and been denied, she came to federal
courts.
She came on behalf of a class of women, and 1 don'tthink there's any question but that women in Texas continue'’
to desire abortions and to

seek

them out, outside our State.

11
There was an absence of any other remedy, and without
•the ability to litigate her claim, as a pregnant woman, who
came seeking relief, and who was affected by the time required
for the federal process, not because of any infirmity in her
own attempts to litigate her interests, that this will in fact
be a case certainly presenting substantial federal question
and yet evading review in the future.
X think the third way in which it is unique is, as
I've stated the fact, that it is the only forum available for
these women.

They have no other way to litigate their interests.
Does that mean that there is no possibility of

q

getting a declaratory judgment under Teams law, even if ~~
MBS. WEDDXHGTOHs

Yes, Your Honor, declaratory

judgments in the State of Texas are limited to a situation where
property rights are Involved,

And we also have a very' unusual

situation in Texas, where we have two concurrent jurisdictions,
on® the civil, and on© the criminal.

And even — there are

some cases which indicate that our State Supreme Court would
not have the ability to mandamus any of the criminal prosecu­
tion officers because the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has
jurisdiction as to all criminal matters in the State of Texas.
a

So, ©van if the woman had been able to bring a
declaratory judgment, which she couldn't, she couldn't have
gotten any sort,.of relief against future prosecution.

And it

w&a exactly the febseac© of the court granting an injunction

12
against future prosecutions which has resulted in the
irreparable injuries these women have suffered.
In Texas, the woman is the victim. 'The State cannot
deny the effects that this law has on the women of Texas.
Certainly there are problems regarding even the use of
contraception.

Abortion now for a woman is safer than child­

In the absence of abortion or legal’medically safe

abortions# women often resort to the illegal abortion# which
certainly carries risks of death, all the side effects, such
as severe infection, permanent sterility, all the complications
that result.
And, in fact, if the woman is unable to get either a
legal abortion or an illegal abortior» in our State, she can
do & self-abortion, which is certainly, perhaps by far the
most dangerous? and that, is no crime.

(microphone noises)
:
Q

The microphone won’t be effective if you have •
j

it covered over.
MRS. WEDDIMGTGN:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

Thank you.

Texas, for example, it appears to us', would not allow
any relief at all, even in situations where the mother would
suffer perhaps serious physical or mental harm.

There is

certainly a great question about it.
If the pregnancy would result in the birth of a
deformed or defective child, she has no relief.

Regardless of

the circumstances of conception,

whether it was because of rape, incest, whether she is extremely
immature, she has no relief»
I think it*s without question that pregnancy to a
woman can completely disrupt bar life, whether she's unmarried,
whether she's pursuing an education, whether she*3 pursuing a
r

career, whether she has

family problems? all of the problems

of personal and family life for a woman are bound up in the
/

problem of abortion.
For example, in our State there are many schools
where a woman is forced to quit if she becomes pregnant.
the city of Austin, that is true.

In

A woman, if she becomes

pregnant and is in high school, must resign, or must drop out
of fch® regular education process? and that’s true of some
colleges in our State.
In the matter of employment, she often in forced to
quit at an early point in her pregnancy? she has no provision
for maternity leave? she has — she cannot get: unemployment
compensation, under our- laws, because the law holds that she
is not eligible for employment,, being pregnant, and therefore
is eligible for no unemployment compensation.

At the same

time, she can get no welfare, to help her at a time when she
i

has no unemployment compensation and she’s not eligible for
any help in getting a job to provide for herself.
There is no duty for employers to rshire women, if

14
they must drop out to carry a pregnancy to term,,

And of course

this is especially hard on the many women in Texas who are
heads of their own households 4, and must provide for their
already existing children.
And obviously the responsibility of raising a child
is a most serious one.

And the time and ©motional investment

that must be mad® cannot be denied.
So a pregnancy to a woman is perhaps one of the most
determinative aspects of her life»

Xt disrupts her foody# it

disrupts her education, it disrupts her employment, and it
often disrupts her entire family life.

And we feel that because

©£ the impact on the woman this certainly# in as far as there
are any rights which are fundamental# is a matter which is of
such fundamental and basic concern to the woman involved# that
eh© should be allowed to make the choice as to whether to
continue or to terminate her pregnancy.
1 think the question is equally serious for the ■
physicians of our State.

They are seeking to practice medicine

in what they consider the highest method of practice. We
have affidavits in the back of our brief from each of the heads
of public

heads of obstetrics and gynecology departments#

from each of our public medical schools in Texas.

And each of

them points out that they were willing and interested to
immediately begin to formulate methods of providing care and
services for wm.<nn who are pregnant and who do not desire to

15
continue the pregnancy.
Thay ware stopped cold in their efforts, avon with a
declaratory judgment, because of the »m*e position that they
would continue to prosecute»
Q

Mrs, Wedding ton, so far, on the merits-;, you’ve

told us about the important impact of this law, and you’ve made
a very eloquent policy argument against it.

I trust you ere

going to get to what provisions of the Constitution you rely
on, because, of course, we’d like to, sometimes
MRS. WEDDINGTONt
0

Very interested.

— leave them out. here, and bs involved simply

with matters of policy, as you know.

J
MRS» WEDDINGTON;

Your Honor, in the lower court, as

1 am sure you’re aware, the court held that the right to
determine whether or not to continue a pregeney rested upon the
Ninth Amendment, which of course reserves those rights not
specifically enumerated to the government to the people.
I think it is important to note, in a Law Review
Article recently submitted to the Court, and distributed among
counsel by Professor Cyril Means, Jr., entitled ’’The Phoenix
of Abortional Freedom*; that at the time the Constitution was
adopted, there was no common lav? prohibition against abortion,
that they were available to the women of this country.
Certainly, under the Griswold decision, it appears
that the members of the Court in that case were obviously

16
divided as fee the specific constitutional framework of the
right which they held to exist in the Griswold decision.
I*m a little reluctant to aspire to a wisdom that
the Court did not — was not in agreement on.

I do feel that

it is that the Ninth Amendment is an appropriate place for the
freedom to rest.

I think the Fourteenth Araendrasmt

is an

equally appropriate place? under the rights of persons to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

1 think, in as far

as liberty is meaningful, that liberty to these woman would mean
liberty from being forced to continue the unwanted pregnancy.
Q

You're relying in this branch of your argument

simply on the duo process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?
MRS. WEDD1NGT0Nt We had originally brought the suit
alleging both the due process clause, equal protection clausa,
the Ninth Amendment, and a variety of others.
0

Since —

And anything else that might have been

appropriate.
MRS. WEDDINGTONs

(Laughing)

Yes.

Since the District Court found the right to reside
in tiie Ninth Amendment, we pointed out attention in the brief
to that particular aspect of the Constitution.
w® would not presume

But 1 think

I do feel that in so much a.i members of

the Court had said that the Ninth Amendment applies to rights
reserved to people, and those which were most important, and
certainly this is, that the Ninth Amendment is the appropriate

17
place.
Insofar as the Court has said that life, liberty, and
the, pursuit of happiness involved, the most fundamental things
of people, that this matter is one of those most fundamental
matters«
I think in as far as the Court has said that there is

a penumbra that exists, to encompass the entire purpose of
the Constitution, that I think one of the purposes of the
Constitution was to guarantee to the individual the right to
determine the course of their own lives.
In so far as there was, perhaps, no compelling
State interest, and we allege there is non® in this case, that
there again the right fixed within the framework of the
previous decisions of this Court.
Q

What is the asserted State interest?

I mean,

is there any legislative history about this statute?
MRS. WSDDINGTONs
there is not.

No, sir, Your Honor.

No, sir,

The only legislative history, of course, is

that which is found in other States, which has been pointed
out to the Court before, and Professor 'Heaps points out again,
/

S

that these statutes were adopted for the health of the mother,
certainly the Texas courts have referred to the woman as being
the victim, and they have never referred to anyone els© as
being the victim.
Times have certainly changed.

1 think it's important

18
to realize that in Tessas self-abortion is no crime.

The woman

is guilty of no crime, even though she seeks out the doctor,,
even though she consents, even though she participates» even
though she pays for the procedure ? she again is guilty of no
crime whatsoever,
Xfc'a also interesting that our statutes

the penalty

for the offense of abortion depends on whether or not the
consent of the woman was obtained prior to the procedure.

It's

double if you don't get her consent,

?
There is no indication in
example•

Pondren , v. State » for

The court ruled that a woman who commits

on herself is guilty of a© crime,

an abortion

Again, she being regarded

as the victim rather than the perpetrator of the crime.
Obviously,, in our State, the offense is not murder.
It is an abortion, which carries a significantly lesser offense,
There is no requirement of — even though the State-,, in its
brief t points out the development of the fetus at an eightweek period, the same State does not require any death
certificate or any formalities of birth? that ’th® products of
such & conception would be handled merely as s pathological
specimen,
Q

And the statute doesn't make any distinction

baaed upon at what period of pregnancy the abortion is
performed?
MRS, WEDDXHGTGH8

U©,, Your Honor, There is no time

limit ore indication of time whatsoever ?
0

so I think -

Welly do you make any distinctior»?

MRS• WEDDXNGTGft.

No, sir.

I do — I feel that the

question of a time limit is not. strictly before the Court,
because of the nature of the situation in which the ease is
handled.

Certainly 1 think, a® a practical matter, though,

most of the States that do have scene time limit indicated
still permit abortions beyond the time limit for specified
reasons,

Usually where the health of the mother is concerned,
Q

What56 your constitutional position, though?

MRS. WED0XNG70N: As to a time limit?
Q

What about — whatever clause of the Constitution

Q

It is our position --

— will that take you right up to the time of

MRS. WEDDIHGTONs

It is our position that the

freedom involved is that of a woman to determine whether or
not to continue her pragnency.

Obviously X have a much more

difficult time saying that the State has no interest in
late pregnancy.•

MRS. WEDDXSSGTON:
Q

Yes, sir.

Assuming that? in all other respects, your

arguments are accepted, why do yon think, in addition to
declaratory relief, you are entitled to injunctive relief?

21
Those are different things, aren't they?
MRS, WEDDIMGTOSJ % Yea, sir.
Certainly, in your dissent , you point out , in Perea vs.
Ledesma, concurring/dissent opinions
Q

That was a dissent?

MSS. WEDDIHGTON§

It was a dissent, I think.

— that there are different standards which apply to
the declaratory judgment and to injunctive relief.
Q

Well, 1 guess w© said that in two or three

rn
more «—
MRS. WEDDIMGTQft2

Yes, that's correct.

And. that's what the Court said, following Zwickler vs.
Koota, that even though they were granting declaratory relief,
that different considerations applied as to injunctive relief.
But it seems that the opinions of this Court have
established that where there is great and immediate threat of
irreparable injury, with no adequate remedy in State courts,
that an injunction is still proper? and it is our position that
there is great and immediate threat or irreparable injury.
Q

In what fonts?

MRS. WEDDINGTON* In the form of a continuing
pregnancy, that will not abate, and that continuas, that —

Yes, Your Honor.

What about the doctor, where a criminal

prosecution was already pending against him?
MRS* WEDDINGTOM% The doctor, as I said, was asking no
relief as to the pending prosecutione,

He was only asking

relief as to future prosecution.
Q

But he was asking for a declaratory judgment?

MRS. W8DDXNGT0N:

Yes, Your Honor, he joined in both;

the request for the declaratory judgment, and —
Q

Well, didn’t Younger and its companion eases

cover declaratory judgment?

MRS. WEDDINGTGNs where there were pending — where
the -«

you had an "I request for declaratory judgment”, there would be
an effect on a pending criminal prosecution.
Q

And was on© pending when this action was brought?

MRS. WSDDINGTONi

There was one pending when this

action was brought? those against Dr. Hallford.
However, in this case, wo submit that if there is to
be any meaning to the federal courts as the supreme arbiters
of constitutional rights, that they must be able to act at
least in some form when there are pending criminal prosecutions.

Q

Well, are you suggesting it ought to be broader

than that?
MRS. WEDDINGTONs

I'm suggesting that in this case

judgment, as X understand it.
MRS. WSDDINGTONs
Q

And the underlying statutes on which the *=■**

Q

Yes, sir.

Yesa

~ prosecution was brought was unconstitutional?

isn’t that it?
MRS. WEDDINGTONs

Q

Yes,

Well, 1 thought that's what Samuels v» Mackell

said you couldn’t have.
MRS. WEDDINGTONj And which your dissent said was
incorrect.
Q

Well, 1 repeat that it wag;.

MRS. WEDDXNGTONs

(Laughing)

It was a dissent, okay.

X think perhaps we would stress that there are two!
separate actions before the Court:

first, that of the worsen?

and, second, that of the doctor.

Q

So that even though the -*»

MRS. WEDDXNGTON:

Even though the doctor — even

though the Court might fine! that the doctor was an inappropriate
party for relief, it certainly would not affect the original
action t as brought by the women.

Q

All right.

The», Z coxae back again;

If wo*re

left only with the ladies * action, are you suggesting that the
declaratory relief they already obtained is not enough, because
•shat doesn't help terminate the pregnancy?
MRS. WSDDINGTONs Because they are still subject to
the irreparable injury, and have no adequate State remedy.
And if they are not able to continue to litigate their interest
in this situation, any time there was any prosecutio?- pending
against any one in the State, at any point in the appeal
for example, the Thompson case was filed in 196 3,

It's? been

decided now in our State courts, it* s on appeal, or it will
be appealed here, 1 think.
And certainly if they cannot litigate their interest,
while there is prosecution pending against the doctor, they
will — in many instance, where a statute ~ whore there’s *—
Q

Well, X suppose the answer is that if there’s

prosecution against the doctor, there’s not going to b® any
doctor that’s going to be available? is that it?
MRS. WEDDXNGTONs

Yes.

They cannot even decide to

take the risk for themselves under the declaratory, judgment.
They must rely on another person to take that risk.
But certainly the doctor raised not only his own
rights, but the rights of his patients? and those same patx ants
are suffering the same sort of irreparable injury that the
original plaintiffs were suffering.

26
Q

crimin&l

Couldn’t the doctor raise that same point in the

prosecution?
MRS» WEDDIMGTOMi-

Yes, Your Honor, he can? but X don't

feel it’s appropriate to make those women, who are most vitally
affected — certainly more

so

than the doctor, who can merely

decided not to perform an abortion and thereby escape —
Q

I'm only talking about the doctor,.

there were two separate issues here.

You said

On the issue involving

the doctor —
MRS„ WBDDZNGTONs
■

Q

A

Yes, eir.

,

— you could litigate everything he's now

litigating in the State courts?
-1.

i1

MRS. WEDDINGTONs

Yes, Your Honor*

My point being that these women should not be- compelled
to leave it up to a doctor to litigate those interests*
Q

Well, he's going to obviously defend himself

in a criminal prosecution, isn't he?

You can count on him to

do that?
MRS. WSDDXMGTONs

Well,

1

think there are different

interests involved, and in most criminal prosecutions the
doctors would bring up other problems, such as —»
Q

"I

didn't do it”, or something like that?

MRS. WEDDXNGTOBJ:

Yes.

Or if the witnesses have

disappeared, or it was really was for this reason, in this
particular

aas©,

2?
Q

Yes.

But has this defease ever been interposed

in a Texas criminal case?
MRS» WEDDINGTONs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Of constitutional defense?

MRS. WBODIHGTOSJt

There is one resent opinion,

Thompson va« The State of Texas, which the Attorney General
attempted to bring to the attention of the Court, and it was
not printed, and the court rejected it.

But it was a decision

about a month and a half ago, which originated in Houston; a
doctor there was indicted on a charge of abortion.
he used only an alibi defense.

At trial

But on his appeal ho did raise

the same constitutional questions that we raised in the federal
court.
Q

The court said that was too late?

MRS, WEDBXNGTOMs
but they didn’t.

Ho, Your Honor, they could have,

They went ahead and litigated those issues»

And our Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which is our highest
court, has now held that'the statute is not vague, citing
Yuitch, which again l would contend is an incorrect reliance»
G

That’s the case you cited to the Chief Justice -

MRS. SJEDDXNGTON:
G

Yes,

— in your argument.

MRS. HEDDXNGTONs And, second, that they specifically
did not determine whether or not there was a right to privacy,
but did hold there was a compelling interest.

23
So, in that particular situation, which is the only
situation a doctor did attempt to litigata the same issues.
Q

And the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has

basically upheld the constitutionality
MRS. ADDINGTONS
Q

—-

Indirectly — they have held

constitutional validity

MRS. ADDINGTONs

of the statute?

they have held, really, directly

in opposition to the federal court opinion from which we are
appealing.
Q

Is that case coming here, do you know?

MRS. ADDINGTON*

They have filed a motion for

rehearing in the State Court of Criminal Appeals, which will
be argued tomorrow.

I think it*8 very unlikely that the court

would change its opinion, and it is the intention of those
parties to appeal.

Q

Yes«

However, does Texas law, in other areas of the law,
give rights to unborn children in the. areas of trusts and
©states and wills, or ~~
MRS. ADDINGTON*
born alive.

No, YOur Honor, only if they are

We have the Supreme Court of Texas that recently

has held in on© case that there is an action for prenatal
injury at any stag© prior to birth, but only upon the condition
that it be born alive.
The same is true of our property law, the child must

i

29

be born alive*
And I think there is a distinction between those
children which are ultimately born, and 1 think it is- appropriate
to give them retroactive rights; but I think that's a completely
different question from whether or not they had rights at the
time they were still in the womb.
Q

What about the unborn child who is, as a result

of an accident, killed, or whatever word you want to use for
them?
MRS. WEDDINGTONt There has been no situation litigated
like that in Teases,
Q

I suppose you noted that the Iowa «■«*

MRS. WEDDINGTONi The Iowa Supreme Court, about two
weeks ago, held that where it was stillborn, there was no cause

speaking solely for the fetus.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY FLOYD, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OB' THE APPELLEE
MR. FLOYDs

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please the

Court s
Xt®s an old joke, but when a man argues against two
beautiful ladies like this, they’re going to have the last
word.

Before 7 proceed to the original issue in this case,
which was the propriety of the trial court denying injunctive
relief, X would like to bring to the Court’s attention some
grave matters concerning what has been referred feo as the
standing of the parties.
The couple involved, they were a married couple,
a childless married couplej the only matter, evidence, or
whatever in the record concerning their contention is contained
in their first amended original petition.

That is, that the

woman would have difficulty,if she became pregnant, in carrying
a child to childbirth

31
Further, that they were unprepared for parenthood.
We subnit to the Court, that their cause of action is strictly
based upon conjectures
her health improve?

Will they continue the marriage?

Will

Will, they then be, at some time in the

future, prepared'or'unprepared for parenthood?
There is no fair prosecution by Mary Doe.

If we

accept all contentions of these — this married couple, we
submit that they still do not come under the prescribed
condition® of Flash' vs* Cohen, and Golden vs. :gyickler,

We

feel that th® lower court properly denied them standing.
As to the unmarried, pregnant female, a unique
situation arises ins

Is her action now moot?

Of course, if

moot, there is no case or controversy
0

It's a class action, wasn't it?

MR. FLOYD;
Q

It was a class action.

Surely, you would — I suppose we could almost

tak@ judicial notice of the fact that there are, at any given
time, unmarried, pregnant females in the State- of Tessas,
(Laughter»)
Couldn’t we?
MR* FLOYD;

Yen, Your Honor*

I would say that the only thing that could uphold
her standing would be -«* cr eliminate the. mootness issue, would

be whether or not this is a class action on her part.
Y^ur Honor

Yets,

32
The record that came up to this Court contains the
amended petition of Jan© Roe, an unsigned, alias affidavit?

and that is ail.
She alleges that she was pregnant on April the 20th „
1970, which is some 21 months ago.
Now, 2 think that it is — it has been recognised by
V

the appellants’ counsel that she is no longer pregnant.
This Court has consistently held that the time of
determination of mootness is when the hearing is before the
court? that is, a case can become moot from the hearing in the
trial court up until the time it reaches this Court.
We do not feel that appellants’ authority, contained
in their brief, will substantiate her contention that the case
is not moot.
I might add this, that X believe the law to be that
if there is a reasonable possibility of reoccurrence of the
situation, then the case would not be moot.

Now, this is the

W» T. Grant case.
The other case or cases concern orders of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, which the Court holds that
there ia a possibility or a. reasonable possibility of continua­
tion of those orders, and the capability of repetition.

It

deals mainly with the capability of repetition.
We think the case of Jans Roe can be easily
compared to Hall vs. Beals.

Xn that particular ease, a group

of voters instituted a class1 action , complaining of a Colorado
statute, which prescribed a residency requirement of six months.
They had, at the time, lived in the State — or at the time of
the election, lived in the State- for some four or five months.
The case came up through the lower courts to this
Court, and in the meantime Colorado repealed the statute, and
established a two-month residency requirement.

The election

was hold in the meantime.
The trial court plaintiffs complained of the two-month
residency requirement.

This Court held the cause of action

moot, even though it was denomination as a class action.
Q

But there's a big difference.

Colorado had

amended its statute, and Texas has not.
MR. FLOYD;

That is correct, sir.

But the fact was that you still had, if it is what
we want to call it, the evil still existing, of two months.
Q

But it was the other statute that had been the

subject of the litigation.

And that statute had been amended,
<

in Hall v. Beals.
\

That's not true hero.
J.

MR. FLOYD;
no.

That's not what we call "white horse”,

1 understand.
In connection with the class action aspect of this,

and I say I have no authority to support this proposition,
but it would appear that in order for a class action to continue,
if there be one to begin with, is that one plaintiff must

34
remain, or else an intervener or someone to fee a representative
of the class.

Because this is the whole purpose of this class

action, to have a representative in court.
Now, the position of the appellant Hallford —
Q

How do you suggest, if you're right, how do you

— what procedure would you suggest for any pregnant female
in the State of Texas ever to get any judicial consideration
of this constitutional' claim?
MR. FLOYD s

Your Honor, let me answer your question

with a statement, if 1 may.
Q

All right.

MR. FLOYD %

1 do not believe it can be done.

There

are situations in which, of course as the Court knows, no
rezaedy is provided.

New, I think she makes her choice prior

fco the time she becomes pregnant.
choice.

That is the time of the

it's like, more or less, well, the first three.or

four years of our-life, we don't remember anything? but once a
child is born, 4 woman no longer has a choice? and X think
pregnancy makes her make that choice«• as well.
Q

Maybe she makes-her choice when she decides to

live in TexasI
(Laughter„}
MR. FLOYD?

May I proceed?

There's no restriction on moving, you know.

Q

No»

35
HR. FLOYD:

Your Honor, the appellant Ha11ford is

under two indictments, charged with the offense of performing
an abortion.

There are no allegations in the complaint of

appellant Hallfcrd- or none in his affidavit, that there is any
bad-faith prosecution, bad-faith arrest, harassment of him at
all, to bring him within the Dcabrowski “special circumstances".
We think the cases of Younger vs. Harris and Samuels
va. Mackell are controlling as to Dr. Hallford's position.
We also feel like that Dr. Kallford cannot rely upon
his patients5 rights to bring him into federal court.

And 1

think the Tiles ton vsUliman case will be authority for that
proposition.
As to the matter of injunctive relief, after a court
once grants the declaratory relief, I will make this comment,
that it appears the Court can consider the propriety of
declaratory relief and can consider the propriety of injunctive
relief.

That is, the Court can divorce the two.

And once

granting declaratory relief, that a statute is unconstitutional,
in its discretion can determine whether or not injunctive
relief is proper and deny it, if it so feels.
should this Court, as 1 understand it, and the
other parties feel that if this Court wants to acquire juris­
diction of the matter , that; the parties would like the Court
to consider all the constitutional issues.

Can wo do that?

You're in the Fifth Circuit-

grant a denial of appeal?
MR * FLOYD t
Q

;

Yes, Your Honor.

I suppose we could do it. if we’d bypass the

Court of Appeals and bring up • your appeal, pending in the
Fifth Circuit.
Q

Ho, no.

We could — couldn't we — you3r© here,

your opponent has brought a direct appeal here, because your

Q

Mr. Floyd, what is Texas' interest in. this

statute?
MS. FLOYD:

Mr. Justice, the Thompson case, which

has been cited to this Court, Thompson v. State.,

the Court of

Criminal Appeals did not decide the issue of privacy,
not before the Court, or the righfc-of--choice issue.

it was
The State

compelling interest because of the protection of fetal life •—
of fetal life; protection.
They recognize the humaneness of the embryo or the
fetus.

And they said, "We have an interest in protection of

fetal life."
Whether or not that was the original intent of the
statute, 1 have no idea.
Q

And yet Texas does not attempt to punish a woman

who, herself, performa, an abortion on herself?

could fee passed.

Whether or not that would bs constitutional

or not —
Q

Well, we're dealing with the statute as it is,

there is no State, is there, that equates abortion with Harder;
or is there?
MR. FLOYD:

There is none, Your Honor? except one

of our statutes said if the mother dies, that the doctor shall
4

be guilty of murder.
Q

But that’s ordinary —

MR1 FLOYD:
Q

— felony murder, isn’t it?

MR. FLOYDs
Q

Yes, sir.

I would say so, Mr. Justice, yes, sir.

The Texas statute covers the entire period of

Yes, it does, Mr. Justice? yes, sir.

Mr. Floyd, is that Thompson ease — I don’t find

Mr. Justice, this case is just a recent

MR. FLOYD:

Fine.

That, in addition, the Thompson case cited, the future
case in regard to vagueness, and said that if it's controlling
•the issue,
And, as I recall, Dr. Thompson raised the issue of
"Well, how can you find me guilty of murder — I mean of abortion
if you make no determination that the fetus is alive at the time
I performed this?* in effect is what he*s saying.
He never admitted to doing it, but he's saying:

How

42
can you prove it?
Well, of course,, the Texas court answered by saying:
It is presumed the fetus is alive when an abortion is performed»
Q

You cited, in answer to ray brother Marshall’s

question as to what is the interest of the State in this
legislation, or what is its purpose, what is its societal
purpose! and your answer was that they relied on your
opinion, the most opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals of
Texas, that it was a protection of fetal life.

And than I

think you also said that was perhaps not its original purpose.
MR., FLOYD:
Q

Well, I'm not sure of that.

Well, it may be rather important.

I ~~
In a

constitutional case of this kind, it becomes quite vital,
sometimes, to rather precisely identify what the asserted
interest of the State is.
MR. FLOYD:

I think that original purpose, Mr. Justice,

sad the present prevailing purpose may be the same, in this
respect.
There have been statistics furnished to this Court
in various briefs, from various groups, and from medical
societies of different groups of different groups of physicians
and gynecologists, or whatever it may be.

These statistics

have not shown me, for instance, for example, that abortion
is safer than normal childbirth.

They have not shown me that

there are n®t ©motional problems that are very important,

/

resulting from an abortion.
The protection of the moter at one time may still
be the primary, but the policy considerations, Mr . Justice,
would seem to ms to foe for the State Legislature? to make
a decision.
*

Q

Certainly that*s true; policy questions are for

legislative and executive bodies, both in the State and
Federal Government.

But we have here a constitutional question

■and in deciding it, assessing it, it’s important to know what
the asserted interest of the State is in the enactment of
this legi a latiori •
MR. FLOYD:

I am — and this is just from my ~~

I speak personally, if I may — I would think that even when
this statute was first passed, there was some concern for the
unborn fetus.

When was it enacted?

MR. FLOYDt

I believe it was 1859 was the original

X —

Well, in any event, Mr, Floyd, apart from your

personal attitude, your court has spoken on the intent of the

don't think the courts have come to the conclusion that the

I just don't feel like they have at the present

In the first few weeks of pregnancy?

MR, FLOYD: Sir?

In the first few weeks of pregnancy?

MR, FLOYD:

At any time, Mr, Justice; we make no

distinction.
Q

Yon make no distinction whether there's life

there or not?
MR. FLOYDs

We say there is life from the moment of

impregnation,

0

And do you have any scientific data to support

45

>

that?
MR. FLOYDs

Welly we begin, Mr. Justice, in our

brief, with the development of th© human embryo, carrying it
through to the development of the fetus, from -about seven to
nine days after conception.
Q

Well, what about slit days?

MR. FLOYD? We don't know.
Q

But this statute goes all the way back to one

hour.
MR. FLOYD;

1 don’t — Mr. Justice, 'there are un­

answerable questions in this field, I —
(Laughter.)
Q

I appreciate it? I appreciate it.

MR. FLOYD:

This is an artless statement on our

part „
Q

X withdraw the question.
(Laughter.)

MR. FLOYD:

Thank you.

That’s really when the soul comes into the unborn,
if a person believes in a soul; I don’t know.
I assume the appellants now are operating under the
i

Ninth Amendment rights.

There are allegations of First

Amendment rights being violated.

However, 1 feel there is

no merit; this statute dess not establish any religion, nor

T -

does it prohibit anyone from practising' or being a part o: any

reiigious group.
I see no merit in their contentions that it could
possibly ba under freedom of speech or press,

In fact, there

have been some articles recently in this city's newspaper —
yesterday, for instance, about this.
The other constitutional rights that the appellant
speaks of, I think are expressed in two manners.

The

individual or marital right of privacy.
And, secondly, or the right to choose whether or not,
to abort a child,
Now, if the Does are out of the ease, the marital
privacy is out of the case.

But, be that as it may, neither

individual nor marital privacy has been held to be absolute.
We have legal search and ssisu.ro? we have the possesion of
illegal drugs,.

The practice of polygamy, and other matters,

A parent, 1 do not believe — a parent cannot refuse to give
their child some form of education.
As far as the freedom over one’s body is concerned,
this is not absolute.

The use of illicit drugs? the. indecent

exposure legislation; and, as Mr. Justice —Mr. Goldberg stated
in'the;Griswold case, that adultery and fornication are
constitutional, beyond doubt.
Q

Are constitutional» or you mean the. laws against

them are constitutional?
MR. FLOYD;

The laws against there are constitutional.

47

Sorry.
Now, there is nothing in the United States
Constitution concerning birth, contraception, or abortion.
Now, the appellee has not disagreed with the appellant’s
statement that a woman has a choice? but, as we have previously
mentioned, we feel that this choice is loft up — is the
woman’s, prior to the time that she becomes pregnant.

This

io the time of the choice.
Now, this was brought out in the Rosen vs. Louis .tana
?

State Board of Medical Examiners case, and in Corky vs. Edwards
which our lower court opinions, and my understanding is that
that Corky vs. Edwards:„.'haa been adopted in this Court.
Q

Has been?

MR. FLOYD?

Has been, yes,

Your Honor.

I am not

positive, but X think it has been.
Q

Texas doesn’t grant any exemption in the case of

rape, if the pregnancy has resulted from rape, either
statutory or otherwise, doss it?
MR. FLOYD:
that.

There is nothing in our statute about

Now, the procedure —
Q

And such a woman wouldn’t have had a. choice,

would she?
MR. FLOYD:

The procedure, and now I am telling the

Court something that’s outside the record? as

I understand

the procedure when a woman is brought in after rape, is to

try to estop whatever has occurred immediately by the proper
procedure in the hospital, immediately she's taken there, she
reports it and they go — but, no, there is nothing in the
statute»
Now, as I previously informed the Court, the
statistics, or the people who prepare the statistics, and the
different statistics are not in conformity, in connection with
the medical aspect of abortion,* that is, whether or not it's
safer.

There are some statistics that will say it is; there

are statistics that say it's not.
There has been provided to this Court the common law
and the legislative history of abortion.

And that the morality

of abortion has bee?» injected in various cases and by various
groups.

We think these matters are matters of policy, and

should be properly addressed by ,the State Legislature.
We think that a consideration should be given to the
unborn, and, in some instance, a consideration should be
given to the father, if he would be objective to abortion.
Thank you, Your Honors.
