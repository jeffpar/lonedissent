MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Ho. ?X~X62S the Board of Regents of State Colleges
against Roth.
Mr. Black.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. BLECK, ESQ,,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» BLECK:

Mr, Chief Justice, Your Honors, and

may it please the Court:
The Petitioners in this case are the Board, of
Regents of the State Colleges,

They are now known as the

Board of Regents of State Universities and, actually, to be
absolutely accurate, they are now known as the Board of
Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.
The other Petitioner in this case is the president
of the Wisconsin State University at Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

The

Respondent, David F. Roth, was the employee of. the Board of
Regents at Oshkosh State University and I believe the enroll»
meat at that time was in the neighborhood of 11,000 or 12,000
students.
Dr. Roth was in his first full-time teaching position,
H© was hired by the Board as an assistant professor for the
academic year 1968-1969.
Q

You call him '’doctor.”

MR, BLECK:

Yea, sir, he is,

Is he a Ph.D«?

4
Q

And where is he now?

MR. BLECK:

Your Honor, X have heard, but 1 had

much rather you would ask the other side because I wouldn't
want to give you any misinformation.

I think they know, and

it is just hearsay on xay part»
Dr. Roth was hired for th© academic year 1968-1969*
He was hired under a written contract, a contract that had a
fixed term, expressly fixing the term for September 1, 1968
through June 30th. 1969«

Th© contract also expressly

referred to Section 37-31 of the Wisconsin statutes, which
is our stats tenure statuta.

This statute at that time

provided that if a probationary teacher is hired for four
consecutive years, he will acquiro tenure or permanent status.
When Dr* Roth was hired, there was a Board rule in
effect, in fact, it had been passed on March 10th, 1967, which
provided that in the case of a probationary teacher, no
z’easons will be given for non-renewal and there will be no
hearings provided by the university on the question of nonrenewal.

This same rule also provided that in each case of

non-renewal, th© professor or th© employee will receive notice
of that fact by February 1st.

So, in effect, he has from

February 1st to start looking for a new position.
The procedure at Oshkosh State University in regard
to renewal or* non-renewal of the probationary contracts was
that the tenure committee of th© particular department would

5
first meet and vote on whether to recommend retention or
non-retention*

In this case, it was the tenure committee of

the Department of Political Science *
then

That recommendation

up to the dean, who also makes & recommendation

and from there it flows up to the vice-president in charge of
Academic Affairs and thence to the president for his decision.
In this particular instance, the tenure committee
met and voted to recommend retention of Dr * Both on
December 17th, 1966,

Subsequently, and about five weeks

later, Dean Arthur Darken approached several members of the
tenure committee and asked them to review this recommendation.
On January 27, 1969 the tenure committee did meet
again, did review their previous recommendation and at this
time voted for non-retention.

This recommendation then flowed

up to the dean and th© vice-president and to the president,
who mad© his decision net to renew I3r, Roth? s contract for
the ensuing academic year •
This notice was given on January 30th, 1969*
Ik*. Roth, on February Xlj.th, 1969 filed his complaint in the
district court seeking declaratory judgment and seeking
reinstatement or a contract for the ensuing academic year*
On May 16th, 1969, both parties moved for summary
judgment and on March 12th, 1970

,

the district court granted

.th© Plaintiff or Dr, Roth's motion in part.

The decision of

th© district court held, on©, that either the State University

6
would have to give Dr, Roth a contract for the next academic
year or, in the alternative, that the State University could
give Dr « Roth a written notice of reasons for non-renewal
and a hearing on those reasons»

Shis decision

was appealed

to the Seventh Circuit which affirmed the district court
on July 1st, 19?!*
Although X have explained the facts rather
extensively, it is my opinion, Tour Honors, that the facts
•«

in the Roth case are absolutely irrelevant at this tine*
The Petitioners are not her© to defend the university* s action
in not renewing Professor Roth*a contract*
Q

Was this in the wo stern district or the

eastern district?
MR* BLECKs
Q

Western district*

Oshkosh is in the western district?

MR, HLEC3C:- Ho, sir, X don’t believe it is, but
the Board of Regents is in the western district,
Q.

And this is Judge Doyle, X take it?

MR» BLECK:

Yes, air, It was*

Whether the university acted correctly or not is
still to be litigated in the district court*

The present

posture of this case does not involve any question of the
First Amendment rights of Dr* Roth,

The issue basically is

whether a state university must give a statement of reasons
and a hearing on those reasons in every case of the non-renewal

?
of a probationary teacher's contract®
Q.

case» what difference does the answer to that question make?

What does he want, rein­

Back pay?
MR. BLECKs

His complaint seeks a declaratory

judgment.
Q,

If ha wins in the district court on that issue,

on being fired for constitutional rights, he will have
gotten all he wants *
MR. BLECKs

Ho, sir, he will not have gotten all

h© wants because the fact remains that he wants reinstatement.
I assume.

I don’t know.

This is what his complaint asks for.

He hasn’t changed it or moved to dismiss it or anything of
this sort.

Ho, sir*

Q,

All right.

MR, BLECK:

Go ahead*

And, to repeat, I am not confessing

Judgment in any way, Your Honors, but because of my personal
doubt as to whether the uni%Tcrsity acted correctly in not
renewing Dr* Roth's contract for the ensuing academic year,
•

. . ‘

! '

r: *

■■

it seems to mo that there is a fundamental errer or wrong in
the decisions below because Br* Roth mad© the allegations in
his complaint that his contract was not renewed because of
his First Amendment rights.

Now the decision below requires

Br, Roth to go to this administrative agency and to have a
hearing before th© administrative agency which administrative
agency

is the alleged wrong doer to exhaust this remedy

before ho can proceed in the district court to determine
whether his fundamental liberties have in fact been violated*
Q

Well, aro you saying they should have gone

ahead and tried the case in the district court right away?

9
MR. BLECSs
Q,

Yes,, air*

Tried the question of whether he should have

been hired on the merits?
I©* BLECKs

The issue, it seems to me, Your Honor,

was whether the contract was not renewed for impermisaehle
reasons or for engaging in protested constitutional activities.

It

that is not established, then the non-renewal would stand,

Q

Mr. Block?

MR. ELEC&s
Q

Yee,

If this Court were to follow the Tenth Circuit

decision that Mr* Go desman

commented on in his argument, I

take it even that subject wouldn’t be open to litigation in
the district court, would it?

Because, as X understand it,

the Respondent hare didn’t have tenure,
MR. BLECKs

He did not have tenure.

He was a one-

year probationary teacher on his first year of teaching
anywhere.

In answer to your question, I would say no.

that if

under the Civil Rights Act, Professor Roth would

I feel

always be able to come into the district court and frame a
complaint alleging that his contract had not been renewed
because of his protected activities*
Q,

Moll, what you are stating Is, if h© states a

good plan of action under the Civil Rights Act, he is entitled
to a hearing»
MR, BLECKS

Yes, sir.

10

Q

Ax*© you saying that because you have a right

to go to count, you don’t have to have admin!strstive hearing?
MR* HLECK:

Ho, sir, I am not saying that®

The

basis of ay argument is that an administrati?© hearing before
an agency that is the alleged wrongdoer, such as the
university3 for this university to conduct on its own motive©
and m motives that might possibly involve fundamental
liberties Just doesn’t seem to mke sens© to me,

Your Honors#

I think the proper form —
Q

Wh&t hapxions with a professor

Oh, yes, we are required to give him a

Q,
of hearing?

Couldn’t you give the other on® the same kind
Wouldn’t it bo Just as fair?

MR* HLECK;

Ho, sir, it wouldn’t, because it seems

to me that if you gave the probationary teacher a hearing,
then you ax*© destroying the very purpose of tenure.

You are

vitiating any distinction between the probationary teacher
and the tenured teacher.

What difference does it make to you in this or any other case,
once you have conceded this much?
MR* BLECK*
Q,
a

Conceded what» Your Honor?

Well, it seems to me that you have conceded

good bit of your case away

when you say your only posture

her© is that he is entitled to a hearing in the district
court and not at all in the university adminlstrative struetur©.*
MR* ELECK *

He is entitled to a hearing in the

district court as to whether his fundamental liberties or
First ihaendment rights have been violated.

1 do not concede.

Your Honor, that h© is entitled to a hearing in the district

or rapport with the student body.

These items as1© not for the

The only issue for the district court, it

seems to me, is the one of the constitutional rights*
Q

Well, I gather you say that because action

12
under 1983 Is predicated on a denial of constitutional rights*
MR* BLECft!
Q

Yes, sir,

And I gather you are also saying that their

predicate on this claim is a denial of First Amendment»
MR® HLSCKs
Q

Yes, sir,

Ho might lose on that in the district court

and there still would be open the question, mooted both here
and in the other case, that he is entitled to a hearing as
a matter of procedural due process which has nothing whatever
to do with First Amendment facts*
MR. BLEGKi
Q

That's right.

It has nothing to do with

It has nothing whatsoever to do with teachers

as a class, does it?

Wouldn't it be just as tru© for a taxi­

cab driver, a bellhop, or a bootblack?
MR, BLECKs
mental employee.

Q

It wouldn't necessarily —

A state action, I'm talking about*

MR® BL.ECK:
Q

Well, it would bo true for any govern­

Yes, sir*

Let'a make it, more sharply, a driver for

some state official, a truck driver.

If h© frames a complaint

under the Civil Rights Act, under 1983, as Justice Brennan
suggested, under the federal rules of civil procedure,

among

other things, he must have a hearing to determine whether or
not he can make his proof.

Are you saying any more than

that when you call this a concession?

13

MR. BLECK:

Not a thing, Your Honor, not a thing*

I just wanted to male® it clear to the Court that the issue
her® is due process of law and does not involve First
Amendment rights of Br. Roth at this time.

The only thing is

due process of law.
Q,

. Well, could not 1983 action be predicated on a

denial of due process?
MR. BLECK:
Q

Y©3, sir.

Was this one?

MR. BLECK:
Q,

Yes, sir.

Both on denial of First Amendment rights and

denial' of due process?
MR. BLECKs

Yes, sir.

A

Q

And the one that is here, the only one that is

hero, is the denial of due process?
MR. BLECK:
Q,

Yes, sir*

Well, why is that here at this stage, if that

is still to be litigated in the district court?
MR. BLECK:

The duo process question is not to b©

litigated in the district court, Your Honor.

The district

court ordered that in every case «»
Q

They've already decided it?

MR. BLECK i
Q, -

They've ordered us to give him a hearing.

That's right, and then that has been affirmed

by the Seventh Circuit end now you bring it here?

14
ME* BLECKs
Q

Yes, sir*

You want to channel him into just a strictly

Section 1983 action, nothing more?
MR* BLEdC:

Yes, sir*

It seems to me that the issue really is whether- the
Constitution recognises a stato system of statutory tenure
or the maintenance of a meaningful system of tenure under
state law*

By creation of Section. 37*31 of the statutes, the

Wisconsin Legislature has recognised the importance of having
a probationary period leading up to the acquisition of
permanent employee status•or tenure.
'/

The probationary employee as well as the university

baa a tremendous interest in maintaining tenure*

The district

court’s decision recognised this and felt that tenure could bo
maintained by application in a case by ease basis of minimal
grounds for non-retention*

The circuit court decision also

recognises the danger to the tenure system*

In fact, every

brief in this case, it seems to zae, recognises the possibility
of loss of tenure*
The purposes of tenure are, ofcourse, academic
excellence or the obtaining of the best possible faculty for
the student body.

Tenure also affords protection for the

faculty and is absolutely essential to the maintenance of
academic freedom*

The Koth decision does threaten tenure

because it vitiates any distinction between the probationary

15
employee and the tenured employee.

This danger would result

from the fact that the universities and colleges just will not
get involved in administrative hearings of this sort or in
protracted litigation.

They will do everything they can to

avoid, such hearings, including the keeping of an incompetent
or unscholarly professor.

I think this is borne out very

clearly by the fact that we have so few discharge proceedings
as against the tenured faculty and so few discharge proceedings
as against the Civil Service»

These things are just not done

in government.
Q

Could I ask you again, let’s assume you had not

appealed the part of the district court’s order which granted
him hearing rights, or you hadn’t brought the court of appeals
decision here and then you had won what was left to bo liti­
gated In the district court, namely the First Amendment claim*
there would still be left the district court’s due process
decision, wouldn’t there?
MR. BLECK:
Q,

Yos.

And what does that mean in terras of the

relationships between the university and Roth?

Does it mean

that h© may not be discharged and h© must be reinstated until
and unless he is given a university hearing?

MR.

BLECK:

It was an alternative order, Your Honor,

one ««
Q,
him a hearing.

All right, so they either reinstate him or give

16

MR* BLEC&S

Give him a contract or give him a

hearing«
Q,

So the district court wouldn’t be purporting

to itself to try out the issues involved in his discharge on
non-renewal»

They would on the First Amendment aide., but

they wouldn’t be purporting to try out whether ho was fired
for incompetence or whether he was incompetent?
MR. BLECH:

X don’t know* Your Honor.

The district

court decisions said that, in recognising the danger of losing
a recognisable system of tenure* the district court said that
the "court will recognise minimal grounds for non-reappointment *
How* what ha meant by that* X don’t know*
Q

Well* anyway* the district court didn’t

contemplate any further proceedings until and unless the
university

gave him a hearing.

MR. BLECH?
Q,

And meanwhile* ho had to he reinstated.

MR* BLECK l
Q

I©* sir.

X see.

MR» BLECK:
order*

That’s right.

What happened* it was an alternative

One, give him a contract, and X assume if

ms

don’t

give him a contract we might possibly be liable for damages ~~
Q

Or give him a hearing.

MR. BLECK:

Or give him a hearing,

ibid w© immediately

asked for a stay of that decision or order and immediately

17
appealed to the circuit court»
Q.

And the court didn't indicato whether or not

after a hearing and a decision against Roth «•» whether or not
th© district court would and to what extent give judicial
review to that decision?
MR* HDECICi

He did not indicate other than to say

that he would respect minimal grounds for non-renewal*
Q

Did the district court indicate what the

district court would do if the university chose not to give
him a hearing?
MR* B&EGK?

Well, then we would have to give him a

contract and if we didn’t give him a contract we would be in
contempt of court*
Are you her© only because you say that, on non­

Q,

renewal of a non-tenured teacher, you don't have to give any
hearing at all?
MR® BLECKl
Q,

Yes, sir*

Or reasons?

MR* BLECKh
clear understanding.

Or reasons*

Dr* Roth was hired with this

This did not come as a shock to him.

This was part of his agreement*

He was given a nine-month

contract and no more.
Q

You say it is simply a matter of contract law

and that the district court and court of appeal wer© in error
in thinking that the Constitution required the courts to add

18
something to th© contract that the parties had mad©.

Is that

it?
MR* BLECKs
Q

Ho, sir* X don't

You don’t say that?

MR» BL3SCK*

«■» I don1t maintain that*

I think it is

a groat deal more than mere contract law*
Q,

How much raor©?

MR. HLECK:

X think* th© court has to balance the

interests hers*
Q,

W©1XS does the court do that in an ordinary

contract ease?

Does it

say, "Look, you really should hay©

provided, but sine© you didn't provide for a hearing on this*
let5© say, tonant cy, year to year tenantey, we are now goring
to require one?*'

o?h© court doesn’t do that*

MR* BLECH:
Q

I never heard of one*

Well* then5 why is there something that is

required her©?
MR* BLECKs

Well, I don’t know, Your Honor, except

that »«
Q

What is your

X don’t really understand your

po@2. felon, .1 guess that3 b my problem, although you have stated
it often enough*
MR*. BLECIls

My position is basically this, that du©

process of law under the Fourteenth Amentent does not require
th© procedural protections of a statement of reasons or a

19
hearing.

Due process of law just does not require It*
Q

Well# then, didn't I state it correctly that

you say that there is nothing in. the Constitution that requires
a court to add anything to the contract that th© parties made
in this ease?

MR* BLECEs

Yea, sir, I guess that's correct*

X think, in weighing the interests *=«
Q,

The hearing before the district court that

you think should be held is one purely on whether First
Amendment rights have been violated?

MR* BLECEs

Yes, sir, that's all.

1 can’t conceive

of any other appropriate issue for the district court*

How,

the district court in its —

Q,

I take it, even if the university conceded that

they did not renew because of his exorcise of First Amendment
rights, that the only remedy ho hag is the 1983 action and the
only hearing he gets is the hearing on the 1983 complaint in
court, that evmin that circumstance h© is not entitled to
any hearing before any university group?
MR. BLECE:

Yes, sir, for very, very practical

reasons, 'because he Is a probationary employee.

Another

thing, these situations are very, very rare, Your Honor, in
say opinion and if some of these constitutional rights are
infringed, I think in moat cases it would bo by inadvertence
or Ignorance of the Constitution.

These are not simplo

20
questions *

And another point» 1 cion51 so® how this sort of

procedure that is suggested in Roth would reality be of any
benefit to the professor or would be of any benefit to the
courts*
Q

So what you say is he has no recourse?

MR* HCiEGK:
Q,

No, sir*

Well, yes —

MR* BLECKs
Q,

He —

If he feels that his —

I understood you to say that h© ©an{t hair© it

in the institution and

whatever he gets in fch© courts is not

going to do him any good.
MR* EL.ECU:

No» I never intended to imply that,

Your Honor *
Q,

Well, you assumed that at the district court

h© could find out why he was fired?
MR, BLEC&5
Q,

Why?

Absolutely*
Because you said under the contract you

are not supposed to give those reasons.

You are not required

to*
MR. BLECK;

But once you are in litigation, you

have all the procedural remedies of a trial.

You have

discovery*
Q,

Well, let me ask you this*

Would it be

cheaper for the university to give Mm a hearing in the
university than to defend against, dollars and cents-wiso?

21
MR® HLBCXf

Ho, si;?, it would not, because we are

talking about hundreds of cases of non-renewal®

We are not

talking about just one specific Dr» Roth.
Q,

W©lls does anybody say that you have to give

a hearing In ©very on©?
MR» BLECKs

That* s what the district court ordered,

that in every «
Q,

Hot in every case*

MR» BLEGK:
Q

Yes, in every case where requested»

Right.

HR» HLECKJ

It is where requested»

And how many of that would be ’’many"?
Well, than© is no way of knowing, Your

Honor, but there are —»
Q,

Well, why is it that you — it’s the first

time 1 ever heard of somebody that wants to litigate something*
Usually everybody tries to got away from litigation»
MR» ELECICs

It would be an unnecessary and time*

consuming and wasteful procedure to put not only the school
through, Your Honor, but it would b© wasteful for the
professor himself»
Q

Hot if his salary goes on if h© requests a

hearing and not if his salary goes on until the hearing is
over *
Q

Well, Mr» Block, if he proves that something

was inadvertent, the case is over with»

You haven81 yet told

m why an administrative hearing is fruitless, other than to

22

say it is the alleged wrongdoer itself* but maybe this is
the purpose of these hearings *
MR« BLECKi Well* first of all, the statement of
reasons*

I don’t know what type of case w©{3?@ talking about,

whether we’re talking about a case that involves First
Amendrnont claims or whether w©*r© talking about such things
as scholarship, rapport with the student body and so forth,
and it is that type of a situation, where these things an©
very difficult to articulate and those decisions are made up
by many, many people» This isn’t the decision of on© mma but
this is the decision of maybe 12 ©r l£ people, and to have a
hearing on whether this particular professor is «*«■ has
achieved a certain level of scholarship, I can't so© where
this hearing would afford anybody any benefit*
merely polarise the parties.

It would

It would involve the entire

student body in the case because the professor would call
hia students and say, "Well, now, I am a good professor,
aren’t I?15 And the administration would call students and
so forth, and you would have just one heck of a mess. These
things just don't work that simply. Also —»
Q,

I take It you are still standing on your basic

position that a non«tenured teacher whose contract is not
renewed is not entitled to a hearing in the university context
under any circumstance?
MR® HLECEt

That is it precisely, Your Honor.

OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. STEINGLASS?

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it

please the Counts
The issue before this Count today is whether nontenured state university professors are entitled to minimal

is not feeing renewed and a minimal opportunity to come
forward with reasons why that decision should not fee mad®.
Q,

A paper hearing, is it?

MR* STEINGLASS:,
not, certainly®
essential.

Ho, I don?t think so.

I would hope

First of all, the statement of reasons is

The hearing itself would serve several functions.

First of all, where there are examples of inadvertence,
ignorance, the teacher would fee able to bring forward those
reasons which would simply clarify th® situation.

Q.

How about cross-examining the witnesses against

him?
ME. STEINGLASS:

Moll, I think the answer to that

question has to fee to look back at th© order of th© district
court.

The district court said the burden would be on th©

professor, so th® professor would have th© initial burden of
stating that either th© reasons offered were wholly iaappro-

palata

op

wholly without a basis in fact*
Q,

Could hs do that through witnesses?

MR* STEINGLASS!
Q

Yes*

Could he h&v© the assistance of Counsel?

MR* STESNGLASS:

X would think that he would be

afel© to have representation there*
Q

X would think, though

Subpoena powop?

MR. STEINGLASSJ

No, no*.

X would think subpoena

Q,

X would —

.Are you talking about a full due process here?

MR. STEIN GLASS:
full panoply.

Discovery?

No, no, I'si not talking about the

What I ha talking about ia an opportunity to

bring forward that testimony— ...
Q,

Is he entitled to as many of the elements of

due process as we held in Goldberg that the welfare recipient
ia entitled to before welfare benefits may bo terminated?
I think w© said there that th© welfare recipient
Is entitled to ««■ not only reasons, but as well the right to
produce

testimony to contest the reasons and to cross-

ozasjlns anyone that was offered and to have th© assistance of
Counsel.

It doesn't have to bo appointed, but h© was entitled

to bring one JP he wanted to*
MR. STEIN GLASS:

I would think so*

I would think

25

the major exception would bo that, because the district court
recognised that «© wore dealing with academic questions, many
of which would »» many of the decisions would rely on very
subtle reasons that, firstly, he had

the co-art had to

afford to the university a very, very wide discretion so in a
welfare case, for example, it would seem to me that there
was — In order to deny a person the welfare assistance,:you
would not simply have to show that your decision was wholly
unsupported in fact.

The burden would simply, for a welfare

director to terminate a grant of assistance, he would have to
show that the facts did show that the person was not eligible,
whereas in the thing that w© are talking about, w© are talking
about a much smaller burden and that the smaller burden is

necessary because the district court did recognise that the
university did have an interest in maintaining a probationary
system in maintaining a system under which they could decide
not to retain a professor for something less than for cause
as for cause has com© to be known in tenured systems®

So X

think that would probably be the major, the moat fundamental
differ©no© between a Goldberg typo hearing, as far as each of
the individual elements that the Court required in Goldberg®
X would think —«
Q,

How about an impartial &©cision«saakor as you

said should be in Goldberg? .
MR* STSISGLASS j

Yes, X wald think that would be

deal of discretion in determining who that dec!aion-makor
would be*

That doesn't necessarily m©an that it has to bo m

In th© context of th© present

to me from a Goldberg, type hearing»

Q

No, but my questions wore addressed to whether

or not the type of hearing you think due process requires in
this situation is th© same time of hearing we set in Goldberg
and your answer soomed to me to suggest yes.
MR* STEINGLASS:

Well, I think the essential

27

difference is that *>•«* and 1 indicated this before — is that
the burdens would be completely different and in Goldberg
and Walker type situations, there is the equivalent of a
for cause requirement.

If you violate X rule you will lost

X benefits# Similarly with a tenure situation, there is that
almost a for cause requirement and this situation, in this
context, there is no such heavy burden ©a the university*

In

Q

Would you think this minimal due process that

you are talking about, fir* Stoinglass, would be limited to
the faculty members, or would it include the elevator operator
who takes the faculty members up to the upper floors of the
building?
MR» STEINGLASS: Well, I would think that
Q,

Assuming that they aren’t covered by a union

contract and have no other tenure?
MR* STEINGLASS:

I would think that in each instance

someone would have to undergo the balancing test that this
Court has undergone in the past and I could well see what might
com© down on a different side of the equation with respect to
an elevator operator than it might with a professor»

X think

there are certain differences when one applies a Fourteenth
Amendment balancing tost. The Court has recognised when an
interest in pursuing a profession is at stale© that that minimal
due process is required* That would clearly form one aid© of

28
the line*

A situation where a person is capable of finding

now employment , whan non'-retent ion will not hay© any adverse
employment consequences* a situation in which a person does
not have to put in a great deal of time and effort and. train­
ing to acquiring their present position* all those might
weigh — would have to foe weighed and might bring one down
on a differant side of the lino.

I xaeans it5s hard.

are a lot of hypothetic&le that w© could deal with*

There
I would

think that a decision that would requ5.ro a university to
provide a minimal due process hearing to a university pro»
fassor for Ms non-retention would not necessarily require
©very governmental employer to provide that same type of
hearing for every employee before they decide not to retain
him.
Q

But that is on th© assumption that it Is all

right to tell the ©levator operator to look for a job as a
mechanic and not to tell a teacher to look for a Job as a
mechanic?
MR. STEBIGLASS:

Well, X think th© Court has looked

at the interests of th® individual involved and I think that
would probably b© th© answer.
Q,

While we have you interrupted, where is

Dr* Roth now?
MR. STEIMGLASS;

I thought you would ask, Your Honor.

Th© first year he was unable to find employment and ho had a

29
poet «-doctoral research — post-doctoral position at oa© of
the Big Ten universities*

After that, he was able to find a

Job and he is presently teaching at a state university in
C-.

Indiana*
You see, one of the problems in cases like this is
that it is not olear, when the initial act complained of
occurs, what the damage is.

The damage may be strung out

over a long period of time.

Whom Dr. Roth commenced this

action

in the federal court in 1969,

he did allege that he

believed there would be a damage to Ms professional reputa­
tion*

At that time it was not possible for him to know what

the situation would be on®, two, three, four year© hence.

I

think there are a good number of federal courts in the country
who have, in individual cases, found damage to professional
reputation being a significant injury and being on© that flows
from a non«r©tention decision.
Q.
carrying

Ho back-pay consequences would flow from the

out of Judge Doyle’s decision below, would they?

The university could grant him a hearing upon remand, and if
it granted the hearing and followed whatever proooduros
Judge Doyle had described and then decided he was dismissed,
there would fee no back-pay claim?
MR» STEXHGLASSs

At this point, Judge Doyle has

not —» I would think fey implication, by delaying, fey not
rendering a decision within one or two months after th© suit

30
was commenced and — the suit was commenced in 1969» in
February 1969®

At that point Roth was asking for reinstate-

amt for the following academe year,

Th© motions for

summary judgment were not granted until March of 1970.

Th©

order ««* which la appealed from in this case — said provide
him a hearing or grant him a contract for th© following
academic year, so th© answer to th© question is that at this
point no on© has ordered back-pay.

We, of course* would feel

fro© to go back to the district court and ask that th© court
consider th© other issues which it left in abeyance during
the pendancy of this and we would think that those substantive
First Amendment issue© may well give ris© to a claim for back­
pay.
Q.

What have you sought on th© First Amendment

claims* reinstatement or damages?
MR» STEIN GLASS:

At th© time it was filed, rein­

At this point, if m had — when wo go back*

because the only issue before the court is the procedural
due process Issue, we will have to reexamin© what m would
be seeking*
Q,

As I take it# if you sustained your First

Amendment claim, damages wouldn't be limited, would they, to
back-pay?
MR* STEINGLASS 8

Not — I — no — damages against —

th© Defendant Guiles was sued in his individual capacity as
well as In Ms official capacity, so as far as his individual

31
capacity»

we

could pursue

we could pursue that®

The question of why we1 re here today is one that
I’ve thought about sometimes.

Sometimes also» X would have

hoped that the order of the district court would simply have
stated effect and that we could have had administrativo
hearing at Wisconsin State University» Oshkosh*

I think ouch

hearing would have had advantages* not the least of which
would have givon persons with academic expertis© and background the first opportunity to review a case dealing with
issues arising out of an academia context*

W© think that in

Itself would be a valuable »« would be valuable in terns of
the resolution of controversies like this within, the university
itself*

It would make the issues much more simple for district

courts when and if they do reach those forms*
Q,

What do you understand are the procedures a

tenured teacher receives, a man or a woman who has six years
or more, isn't it now, under the state statute?
MR® STEIHGLASS:
Q,

Yes* sir*

Thoy’v© got six years and they have tenure

and they rocoiv© a notice that their position is terminated*
How, what kind of a procedure does the university give that
parson?
MR* STEBI GLASS?

Yes, they would receive a statement

of reasons why they were being discharged in that case and
they would have a hearing on that*

32
Q,

Essentially Xik© the hearing that Judge Doyle

has ordered here?

In general outline?

MR* STEINGLASS?
hearings*

Is we never seen one of those

I do not think that it would in that Judge Doyle

lias not ruled on any of the elements of the hearing.

His

ruling was rather narrow, that it be a minimal hearing.

I

think the major differ once, again., would be the standard that
ms to be applied.

A t©aether with tenure could only bo

dialia sod for cause and that for cause has a great deal of
substance, ewer?, though it is two rather simple words and that
Bubstantatiwo difference in th© standard —»
Q,

Well, you are going into th© basis of the

decision, but the mechanism, the machinery of reaching that
decision,

is it the same for th© tenured teacher as for

Mr. Roth?
MR. STEINGLASS?

Well, I would like it to be the

same for the — for Dr. Roth as it would for the tenured
teacher.

2 don't think this Court necessarily has to conclude

that if they chose to affirm the decision of the district
court.

The district court was rery careful in pointing out

that it was a minimal type hearing.
Q,

I don11 want to ««•

You didn't define what minimal was,

MR, STEINGLASS?

I think for good reason*

for good reason, Your Honor.

I think

These cases will b© coming up

in the future in districto, both in Wisconsin and in other

33
places in this eountry and X think the determination of what
a minimal hearing would consist ought to rate a case fey case
determination by the courts.

X think there is good advantage

not to create a constitutional strait jacket in which ©very
university must fit*

X think there is a groat deal of varia»

tion within the phrase Minimal &u® process*"

X tried to

point out on© or two of them when X discussed the identity
of the examiner*

He could b© within the university» he could

be outside of the university, he could fee — it could bar©
been Defendant Guiles if, when he had received the statement
of reasons why David Both was feeing not retained, ho had
decided to call David Roth and ask him, did you devoto one-half
to three-quarters of your time in class talking about
extraneous matters?

Did you miss this day ia class?

mate© these public statements?

.Did you

All of which were ia a

memorandum which Counsel was able to discover in pre-trial
discovery, but unfortunately was unable to obtain prior to the
initiation of such action*
The constitutional basis for the position wo are
advancing is alternatively the First or the Fourteenth
Amendment.

It is our legal position that when a nonteaured

teacher is facing

retention for reasons which may — well,

is facing retention, those reasons on which the retention is
based may implicat® First Amendment values, thus entitling him
to a statement of reasons and to a minimal hearing,

The

3k
pheasant cas© is quit® good as far as illustrating What the
hearing would have accomplished.

*?3a© reasons in the present

case did on their face implicat® First Amendment speech.

The

university relied on three quotes that David Roth was
alleged to have made, in fact, did sake»

They alleged that

thee® quotations evidenced an unscholarXy approach to the
truth, thereby making Mm unfit to remain for another
academic year, although to© was certainly fit to remain, for
the rest of the present academic year because to© was non-»
retained rather than discharged*

And at a hearing, he would

have been able to bring forward evidence showing that — that,
number one, he did substantiate th© claims which the univer­
sity alleged had been unsubstantiateds number two, he would
have been able to bring forward evidence showing that each of
the individual infractions which he was alleged to have
committed did not take place®
able to

As it was, h© was finally

in th© district court on the motions for summary judgment,
but not before then*
Q,

Are you suggesting an inconsistency,

Mr* St ©inglass, in th© position of non-renewal and keeping
him for the balance of the year?
MR* STSHG-LASSS

Well, I’m suggesting — I’m — I’m

suggesting that, through th© expedient of keeping & teacher
to the end of th© year and simply saying, “Now we have

35
decided not to retain you*

and so, ©lac© Wisconsin statutos

do not provide any procedures and* in fact* don't limit us
in the reasons w© slight choose, we"XX do it this way," rather
than saying n¥e{& better get rid
Q

I

would --

Having mad© a commitment for the whole year,

for nine months, the school year, are you suggesting the
university should not keep it if they can possibly do it,
consistent with the welfare of the university?
ME* STEINGLASS:

¥©11, X

1 wouXdnet want the

university to violate these contractual rights, but ii* he
was unfit or not a proper teacher, the university could simply
offer to pay out his salary if it became that serious*
Q,

Isn’t it reasonable that he might hav© been

in the situation that h© wasn’t bad enough to fir© but not
good enough to keep?
MR* STEINGLASS:
Q

Yes.,

And so they would let him run out the full year

so that he has a chance between February 1st, X think, your
friend said, when h© receives the notie© until th© following
September or October to find another .job.
MR* STEINGLASS:

Well, that’s certainly a distinction

between th© two.
In undertaking the balancing approach that this
Court’s decisions have required in determining whether or not
.

minimal procedural safeguards will b© extended to persona

36
whose Interests aro adversely affected* the district court
did teke into consideration the value of the tenure system
and very carefully attempted not to dilute the tenure system
in any way.

We have th© suggestion* however* that the

decision, somehow vitiates the distinction between tenure and
elastic tenure«

The opinions below* both district court and

circuit court* make clear that there was no intention to
vitiate the legal distinction between those two* between
statua of tentire and ~~
Q

Would you say that — let’s assume that a non-

tenured teacher gets notice that Ms contract will not he
renewed and it la stated in the letter* ”We have no reason
other than the fact that we think we can find someone better
sosa©time than you are.”
MR* STEIMGLASS:
Q,

That is th© only reason they have*
And the teacher «—

Wo don’t claim you have don© anything wrong at

It would not be a valid

reason to let a tenured teacher go*
Q

I understand that*

MR» STEIHGLASSs

But nevertheless, the non»

tenured teacher alight well believe that not to be the real
reason, and so X think h© would have a right to request a

do you differ this situation from the tenured teacher?

Would the length of his hair be cause?

MR. STEINGLASS:

For a tenured teacher?

I -would

trying to draw the substantive, the

lines on the substantive reasons, is just extremely difficult.
The point we’re before the Court on is that there must be
some reasons which are so absolutely devoid of reason, that
are so wholly unreasoned, that are so wholly without basis in
fact that reliance on them would constitute a violation of
the Fourteenth Amendment.

would violate —

In other words, at that stags, the university,

"You just use your language, somebody’s language today, you

they ought to b© required to provide the reasons in sufficient
detail ao that a response is capable of being framed.

that there are some reasons that are so arbitrary, so without
foundation» that it would b© a violation.
one very important point.

But let me make

We are not resting our case on an

attempt to resourcet the Fourteenth Amendment *

What we are

saying is that the First Amendment, the First Amendment
requires that a teacher be provided with a statement of
reasons and this due process hearing « minimal due process
hearing.
We would say that there is also an. argument to b©
mad© that the Fourteenth Amendment requires it, not because
it's a right, a substantive due process right, but because
a decision terminating or not renewing a teacher adversely
affects very fundamental interests of that teacher.
Q

Now, would you make the same claim for a

was not hired, as you make for a person who was not rehired?
MR. STEIN GLASS:

First, I might say parenthetically that the

You don’t claim the man was fired, do you?
