JUSTICE BURGERS

We will hear arguments

aciKfe in 70-94, in the Matter of Paul Pappas*
Mr. Frettyman, yen may proceed whenever you®re ready.
BHAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTWiaN, JR., ESQ.,
OBI BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PHKnftKQkSs

Mr. Chief Justice, way it please the

Court a
I represent the petitioner in this case, Paul Pappas.

This Id the third case in the trilogy now before the Court
involving the First Amendment to newsmen.
The fasta in the case are relatively simple.

Mr.

Pappas is an experienced, professional newsman-photographer
for WTEV~TV, with its principal offices in New Bedford,

Massachusetts«
*

The station covers all of Rhode Island, part of
Massachusetts, part of Connecticut.
On July 30th, 1970.. he was in Providence, Rhode
Inland when he received a call from his station telling him to
-■i to > Mr Irritcri.

“They seem to be burning down Hew Bedford”

rfor message that he got.

"They” were not identified.

lio want to Haw Bedford, to the west end of the town

a.
<■}■■;wi

apparently, these disorders had been described for him,
ha there r&r.'into a barricade*

He therefore returned to

1:. R:',.. Bedford office, after which he received another call

from his superiors tolling him that if he went back to the
area he wouM be allowed into the area through the barricade»
He returned and he set up his cameras outside a
boardsd~up variety store, which apparently was being used as
headquarters for the Black Panthers»
He set up his camera* and a spokesman for the Panthers
came out of the store* with about a dozen blacks; they
gathered* and the spokesman gave a press interview.

There

ware approximately five newsman present* including Mr» Pappas.
Ml of the films which Mr. Pappas took of the news
conference were subsequently given to and viewed by the
district attorney.

TL-e next sequence of facts which actually gave rise
to this case were prompted by two occurrences.

First, during

the news conference, the spokesman said that the police would
be allowed-into the. store if they had search warrants, if they
conducted themselves in a gentlemanly manner, and if they were,
accompanied by the news media.
The second occurrence was that at a kind of side
, .r.

i

nee,• after the spokesman had gotten through with his

formal press? conference, the Panthers complained to Mr. Pappas
the nerm media always covered the side of the police in
airouretraces such as thec-3, and on this point Mr. Pappas said,
Wall, that’s because the madia are never allowed to show any
other eide.

5
wow;, it waa as a result of these two occurrences
that the tanthses then agreed 'with Mr. Pappas that ha would be
allowed into their headquarters that evening, to spend the night
if he wished,, if he came back personally.
But there was a condition:

If there was a raid, they,

said, he would be allowed to report and photograph anything
that took place

on the other hand, if there was no raid, there

was no raid, any ~~ as he put it, 183Anything X saw or heard
would be strictly in confidence.®
Later that night, after he had been accompanied back
to and into the headquarters* these conditions were .
they were specifically stated again, and he again agreed to
them.

As a matter of fact, there was some adverse comment

about whether he might not be a police stoolie, and he assured
them, j?o, he was there as a representative of the press,
etc understand!-jig was that if there was a police raid, he was
free to cover it; if there was .no police raid, he would keep
.-.hatever ha saw or heard in confidence•
Q

••

Suppose, right there, Mr. Prefetyman, that an

uwxwweted event took place then, not the police raid, but
suppose som© internal quarrel of the group resulted in one
of ties: killing another in his sight* do you think that pledge
of confidence would be protected?
i€U itM'iyMiib*
t:.;ic play,

i think the privilege would corns

I think that in the subsequent hearing on whether

6
fcJtare «era overriding public Intercast in the production of bis
testimony, it might wall sway the court that ho saw,during
ths; pario cl of conf iiouiiality and privilege,an event which %/as
so vitei to the public interest that he should fee required to
testify- anyway„
Q

Well, let’s redace the crime now.

killingt. it was just a serious injury.

Instead of a

Same procedure?

MR. PRETTYM&N: This is precisely, Your Honor, why
we suggest to you that there must be © balancing test,'and this
is< one of the factors? that undoubtedly a judge would take into
consideration in determining where the balance lj.es in this,
particular case,
How serious was the event that he saw?

Was there any

other source for getting the information? What was the public
interest in it?

Did he in fact have the relevant information?

And so forth.
These are the very factors that a court would
scr.sidar in determining whether he should be made to testify.
G

betid yon say the same result would obtain if,

while; there, he observed thorn packaging or processing heroin
from the raw state to a street-sale state?
MR. PRETTYMASJs

Precisely.

So long as -- so long as

ad this occurred during the period when the
privilege was in effect.
Now, the period here, we must remember, went into

?
offeci alien he went into the headquarters, not. beforehand.

Mrd up until the time that there was a police raid,, all
restrictions were off.

if anything occurred inside thereF

then that was privileged. Sut the Court might veil find, in the
given circumstances, that the public interest overrode
privilege, as it does in —■
Q
these people?

But what doss that do to his credibility with
1 suppose —.

MR. PRET’PYMANs

Your Honor, 1 thin!; that a relation"

ship of confidentiality that can come into affect for any
number of reasons.

1 can only say here that while he apparently

so far as the record shows, did not have a long acquaintance­
ship with the people, there obviously .wap something about his
demeanor and his seriousness at the time of the press
conference, which made them believe that they could trust this
man.

“lliey did not give the same privilege to the other five

nswSDen who were present.
Q

Mr, Prettyman, I take it then, that you say that

the balancing -goes..on on an ad hoc basis in each particular
case, on the specific facts of each case?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
Q

Yes, sir.

Without any general rules or standards.

MR. PRSWTYM.RK:

The general rule that I would lay down

hr. Justice White, is that there is a privilege and that there
a.

a presumption that the newsman is protected, and then and

only then can tbs government come in with its burden and attempt
to carry it by showing the various elements which we have
outlined in our brief.
f

Sell, what ivovlcl you require them to show?

1‘hey say w® need this evidence to prove a crime ? the packaging
of heroin or the making of bombs or a murder, or something
like that.
t®. PEJKJTYMhitfs

Well, let me emphasize first of all

that there5s absolutely no evidence in this record of any
02:200; occurring during these three hours.

1 want- to make,

tltft clear,, because this is not a criminal case,.
Secondly, assuming that there was a crime, then I
would, say that they would have to show that the grand jury is
.Investigating a specific crime.

2 would say they would show

that he had, at least probable cause to believe that he had
information relating to that crime.
b'o. 3» that there was no other available source for
receiving, obtaining the same information.
And, finally, that there was, as this Court put it
b ?b-bbtb: rTvs:'riding interest on the part of the public in
obtaining that information.
Q
nor.*

bell, on that latter point, just the necessity

criminal case wouldn’t be automatically enough,

would it?
tb. y: yoO'JoOM: .

bo, sir.

In my view it would not.

I a:,

1 confess that a rule could

In my own view, I think;, for

example, take ike mxmosborg ease, that it’s more vital that the
public know that a youngster can get a drink in that community

for carier tier he ere rat pot? he can/pot virtually by asking
for it, and that he caret get a drink.
I think it

3 mere important that the public know that

than that those boye be prosecuted.
On the other hand, I can well see chat in a murder
case, a desperate crime situation,'that the interest might lie
otherwise.
tout 1 suppose if you’re going, really, to

o

achieve. your purpose of maintaining the flow of information,
there must b*a ;omua predictability involved in applying these
rules you’re suggesting.

Mow, 1 just wonder if the rules you

Kv.ggosted wculd allow any person who is worried about dis~
cbootoo: to predict whether a reporter’s claim of privilege
mmole be rmspmeteti or not, in this particular case, on an ad
he c c a 3a -to ■- car a to al ancing approach ?
ME. FhElhhhihNYour Honor, X think there’s the same

So it would foe just sort of an odds thing? 1

Yes.

MR. PRETTWiABI:

I am afraid, Your Honor, that if the

Stricken?

MR. PRETTYMM:
Q

It hasn’t existed yet, has it?
If it was not allowed.

It hasn’t existed yet, has it?

MR.•PKETTYMA^:

— we would have a more serious

situation.
Q

Mr. Pretfcyman, you say that one of your standards

tlithe era.id jury must be investigating a specific crime.
at sevvade simple, but 1 think that, to me, it imposes some
problems• Sac-posing you have a grand jury convened to, say,
yafayate

ambulance chasing ring with police participa-

t:L n, as they recently had in Chicago ? or a widespread graft
corruption by an official.
of' that inv »

Now, l take it, at the outset

yatJ.cn yeai carat say that there was probable

11

causa to indict any ps.rtiiv-.ilax individual, you're not oven sure
fi crime was conuisitfced „

Would that come within your definition

of a specific crime?
MR. PRETTYMAN;

Your Honor, if you will look at the

Caldwell subpoena you will see specific crimes set out that the
grand jury was investigating.
On the other hand, if you would turn to our single
appendix, on the first page, you will see that the subpoena
orders Mr. Pappas to appear and "there to give such evidence
as be knows relating to any matters which may be inquired of
on. behalf of the Commonwealth before said grand jury."
Now, the Massachusetts Supreme

Judicial Court

hay said that Mr. Pappat carries a burden to show that the granc
jury inquiry is improper or oppressive.
X would like anyone to tell me how we can shot; that
this is improper or oppressive grand jury inquiry, when we

don’t even know what in the world they're investigating.
Q

Wall, what, then, is your answer to my question?

MR. PRETTYMMJs

My answer is that while it's quite

true that in many instances the grand jury will go from one

crime: to another or will go. from suspicion to fact, that where
you have a First amendment privilege involved, a heavy duty
. solved in the prosecution in trammeling on that privilege,
that there: there is a duty to indicate the kind of situation
that they're inquiring into.

12
As a matter of fact;? If you don't, do that, you are

not eve i sure whether tLa privilege covers the precise situation
that they1? re looking to.

Q

Well, suppose —

MR. PLETTYMAHs
Q

For example, —- if I might just —

Go ahead.

MR. PRES't’YMJl’dt

if it turns out that what they

were really investigating here was something that happened on
June 3th, when these disorder?* apparently were going on, as
opposed to July 30th, that would be an entirely different
situation than If they were looking into something which they
think happened during the three hours that he was present in
the headquarters.

X think there’s a duty and a burden upon them to come
forward with an indication of what it is that they’re investi~
gating.
Q

Wall, supposing they do come forward and say

that, We’re investigating allegations of an ambulance chasing
racket with police connivance and violations —■ which could be
violations of several State statutes, and say no more than that.
Boos that rivet your test of a specific crime?
ME* PhST1XYMMs

If they' cited the statute that they

gave a period of time and a place wher

ii ms ;.nr.::.,Qcsd to have occurs.vd, I would say yes, it would

vcyylc?

;; k-s to point out here, just by way of

a.rpmplo, tint tba M&«s&chusett$ Supreme Court took judicial
notice of the- fact that there was gunfire, but they never said

when, where, fey wheat, and certainly didnst say that it had
takan place during the three, hours he was there.
And this is the kind of danger I think you run into

if you don't Lave scene specificity in regard to subpoenaing
newsmen before a grand jury.
Q

Mr, Prettyman, is that the normal subpoena in

Massachusetts, in that general language?
MR, PRETTYMAN:

It’s my understanding that while

sometimes they are more specific, that this is ~~ as a matter
of fact it*s on a form, Your Honor, because it has a —
Q

Ivsll, that's what X assumed it was,

MR, PRETTYMANs
a blank-space:
Q

Yes.

It has, as you'll see it has

"said blank or the grand jury".
tall, what I was thinking was that Under that,

r.v vh like the question I asked in the first case, in Massachu­

setts everybody, including those with privileges, like
vvvc rno7~eXidnt, physician-patient, everybody else, with that

::cacr,:v,l subpoena, would have to go except the newsmen?
Mv, vkiithiliTs
it

Your Honor, it was not argued below

;vase that the nan did not have to appear before the
jury.

i well point one to you, however, that if there

vvv over v v.v;: uhziXt hits appearance would be a useless act.

14
it would be this one, for this reason —
Q

Well, that's not my point.

My point is, they

might be wanting to question him about a homicide by automobile,
which he happened to witness on his way to work.
MR. PR3TTYMAH s But that would not have been received
in confidence, Mr. Justice Marshall.
Q

But I mean — but if he was a newspaperman, he

wouldn't go.
MR. PRETTYMMJ:

Mo, sir.

I quite disagree.

He would

go, and he would be required to give testimony, like anyone
else.
Q
the peoples

Well, suppose on this day he -went there and told
Whatever you say I'll keep it in confidence.

And the nest day he witnessed a fatal automobile accident.
And he gets this general subpoena.

And he'll — I understand

your position to say ha won't go?
MR. PF.ETTYM&N;

No, no.

X was raising the generality

of the subpoena only in relation to the specific confidentiality
t.at has been imposed upon him. What I say is that in view of
the fact that once the confidentiality is imposed, you therefore
::m. right smack info your First Amendment problem, that the
■:y.ii‘±naz< duty of the Commonwealth is to simply order a •— to
L:: r.s a general subpoena, mm. : go by the boards because then,
since you're entrenching or First Amendment rights, they have

■r:f to be ncro specific and carry more of © burden ~~

Q

hall , why do they have to he more specific about

this automobile accidant with the reporter than with anybody
else?
MR. PPBSfPMAH; Because the judge is going to have to
make a decision —
Q

Why?

MR. PEETTYMAH j

Because he’s a reporter.

situation he witnessed a crime.
MR. PREOTYMAN:

Your Honor# I ~

So merely because he’s a reporter you have to

give him. some kind of a hearing.
MR. P • JETTYMAN s

X think you have to give him a hearing

Merely because he;s a reporter.

MR. PIIETTYMAN:
:

Merely because he is part of the press

in otior to rat the dissemination of information to the public,
tod without this kind of showing *—

Q

fall, hm does the grand jury know that he’s got

16

this confidential information?
MR. PRETTTMAN:

In my case.

He asserts it in the same way that a

grand jury doesn’t know that a fellow is going to plead the
Fifth until he pleads it.
Q

Wall, let's get our facts straight now.

He got

confidential information, and he witnessed a crime? two separate
things.

One wat in Boston, and one was in Cambridge.

he gets a subpoena to come to the grand jury.

And

And ha says,

Unh-hunh, solely because l*m a reporter, no go; you’ve got
to tell me what you want.
MR. PRETTYM&H:

Your Honor, if 1 understand your

question correctly, what he saw was not protected by the
privilege because he did not receive it in confidence —
Q

That's right.

MR. PRETTYMAN;
other man.

and he stands in the shoes of any

The problem arises only when, as a newsman, in an

attempt to gather, edit, analyze, write, and disseminate the
information to the public —
Q

Well, he hasn’t pleaded that yet*

MS. PRETTYMAN:
Q

Well, that —

So nobody even knows he's got it.

MR. PEETTYMUBs Well, the fact remains, Your Honor, —
Q

Then he still — he gets different treatment on

that subpoena.
MR. PRETTYMAN;

Yes, sir.

11
Q
HP;.

That's my problem.
oEBTTYHANs

Yes, ha dees, 'four Honor.

And I can

only reiterate that the privilege comas into effect when he is
obtaining information iv confidentiality from sources’which,
but for the con fidentiality, he would never receive the story
and the public would never receive the story,
Let ns take this particular case, for example.
assume there had been a police raid this night.

Let9

The fact of t

matter is that the police raid would never have been covered
from the inside except for this agreement of confidentiality,
i’ho public would never lave received the story about that
police raid from anybody5s viewpoint other than the police„
How. it so happens that the Panthers wanted their
0..1.3 at least told for once, not in a prejudice sense but to
have somebody not just take the word of the police as to what
hat happened.

And, notice, they placed no restriction on him

iv... regard to his reporting of the police raids

You are free

to report it any way you want to, to photograph anything you
want to.

And where, in the instance that yon

pose, you did not say that an element of confidence was imposed
upon him,

Q

Well , the newspaperman received information in

confidence, which he never published any place.
MR. PHSTTYMMJ? All right.

How, there is a lot of

information, Your Honor, which is used —
Q

hall, X mean, does th© fact that he has this

information, or is it the fact that he’s a newspaper reporter?
That*© my only point.
in. prsttymakt Can 1 draw this» distinction for you?
A reporter goes to a public press conference by the President
of the United States.

He is there like any other reporter,

no confidentiality applies.

He, like a reporter, is like

everybody else except that he's reporting.

The story goes out.

The next day the President calls the reporter in and
bo says, °l would like this off the record. But I'm not sure

tl'.k yoo folly understood the point that I was trying to make,
.A.,

l want to give you an in-depth look so that in your future

/

; orting, even though you do not report what I say, that you
ail

t.:.\:;'arst-uid and have a depth of knowledge about this that

will make your reporting to the public more meaningful."

And he therefore gives him the story,
Bov7» 1 say, without relevance to the Presidency# I

only way a grand jury is going to get out of him what the
Jx-rident has teld hiv.v is if it shows an overriding public

He did respond to the subpoena, as I understand

it.
MR. PRETTYMAN* That is correct.
The other point is that, in view of what, the Caldwell
court said about the Black Panthers, that would be equally
applicable hers.

That is, if he disappeared again into the

grand jury room, "it might be that a number of things could
happen, including his personal safety, as he testified.

Absolutely.

Mr. Prettyman, I'm not sure I track the analogy

tact you introduced about off-the-record background news
conferences.

Wes it your position that if, let us say a

Congressional Committee, to gat away from a court for the
:uuunt, called this newspaper reporter and said. What did the
President, cr some other government official, say to you in
background conference? that he would have this same kind
.£ a privilege not to disclose it?

MR. PYSTTYMAN;

But, yes, that's absolutely right.

What happens, as we see it, is this:

as in this case — What did you see and hear during your three
hours in the headquarters?

Did you sa© ammunition?

to rely on some analogy.

And then what happens is he refuses to answer the question, and
ae goes before the judge, if the prosecutor persists.

My

fe.sling is the prosecutor wouldn ‘ t have called him in the first
place, or won*t persist if the court rules the right way» but,
in any event, he gee a before the judge and the judge says, as he
die in this case — Pappas was asked questions, and he told
the circumstances under which he was at the press conference?
he told the circumstances of his specific agreement, how he
went in, how he was made to promise again, and how he came out.
Then the judge, having satisfied himself that in fact
a confidentiality was imposed upon him, that he is in fact a
newsman, during the course of his employment? then 1 would say
that the judge then turns to the government or the State and
says, All right, if yon persist, you now have the burden,
because of the First Amendment situation, you now have the
burden to prove various factors.

Well, don’t they have to come and- at least

MR. PI&TTYM&Ni

Your Honor, I thought 1 put that to

rest, in the sense that while t do believe that Mr. Pappas
should not be made to appear; 1 have to concede that it was
not argued below.
Q

You understand —

You're not saying here that these classes of

people you're reading don't have to appear —
MR. PRETTYMAN-«
0

Oh, no.

you're saying they may not have to testify?

MR. PRETTYMANs

Wo.

The argument has been made by

Massachusetts, and perhaps suggested by the Justice, that the
ordinary person has to turn up and testify, and that wa'r©
carving out of that, out of this inviolate right of the grand
jury some special case for newsmen.
Q

But all I'm saying is —

but none, of that list has a constitutional

That's absolutely correct.

that3s correct.

In Massachusetts, there is a list, which I

won't read, but which in quite similar to the one I’ve just
reach

For exanpla, a physician doesn't have a privilege, but

a psychotherapist does.

I mean there are all kinds of

exceptions that people have right now.
So the only point I’m making on this, that it isn’t
as if we are saying the newsman is the only one out of the
population who doesn’t have to turn up to testify.

X agree with you.
But, my brother Stewart, I don't sea why you keep

arguing that point? it’s your case.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

1 wonder if I can get to the point

sfcice Stewart made in the Branaburq case about
speech versus the press.
Mr, Justice, I think if these were essentially the
same interests, if they were equally protected, there would be
no need for any reference in the press —* in the Constitution
to the press, as such.

The press privilege would bs covered

by the speech privilege.
IC think that the speech privilege is not as broad as
tlvj funetitning process by which the press operates.

To put it another ways
than e: right to speak*

that the press right is more

The mere right fe speak without being

cRRUi to obtain information, for example, would be a meaningless
one.
Speech normally involves an individual or a group
attempting to express an individual view.

The press covers

29
insemination, not only the views of
news p:.:op;Lv\ and individuals bat the gathering and analysing
and publishing of the whole raft of news that gats before the
pub 1.1c,
1 think that.our Founding Fathers recognized that it's
one thing just to speak out, but that it’s also vitally
important to get the widest possible range.of information
before the public, and the way to do it is through a free and
untramme1ed press.
Q

My guestion didn’t suggest that they were

equivalent rights, but only that they were equally protected,
MR. PKETTYMAS5? Well.

1 think that there are

situations where they may well not foe equally protected.

There,

I could envisicn s, statute that’s passed ~~
Q

T/e 11, I don’t think you mean that.

They are

The lower, courts have

recognised that television is.
As a natter of fact, if anything, there should be
more of a right rather than a lesser one, because the figures
show that, ©s compared with the largest daily newspaper
circulation of some two million, CBS daily news in the evening

The State did not

put on a single witness? it gave no testimony; it offered
nothing in any way at the hearing. The only witness was Mr.
Pappas, to establish the confidence.
The State not only carried no burden, but Massachusetts
said it did not have to, that there was no right to be
recognised, and consequently the State carried no burden.
And it said that if we want to prove that the grand jury was
oppressive in some fashion, we would have to do that; but,
again, sin?:* we are totally at a loss to know what it is' that
they went and. why, it's impossible for us, obviously, at this

And ii

Is regard, I’d like to relate —

take just a moment to relate an incident that X guess sustains
this argument, because to me it drives home the importance of
what we’re talking to here.
Eugene Patterson of the Atlantic Constitution told
of an instance where his paper did an expose on narcotics in
the Georgia State Prison System.

They got the information from

a doctor, who had worked there, and who insisted, for obvious
reasons, that his information be kept confidential.
The paper published the expose, and immediately a
grand jury was called.

The grand jury wasn't investigating

the narcotics in the Georgia Price System? the grand jury wanted
to know the doctor's name.
And the publisher refused to produce the doctor's
name.

And at the last minuta, so as to keep him from going

to jail, the doctor revealed his own name, and the grand jury
was di&missed.
New,

HR* P8ETTYM&Ns

Well,. Your Honor, that's a large

m.::-V'M£tiont and X ha not sure yea can make that,

The point is,

that having received something in confidence and then having,
in effect., broken the confidence later, 1 think that that
newsman * s effectiveness could'well be damaged.

Q

Well, not only with that group but with others,

you*re saying?
MR. PRETXTMANs

Absolutely.

In his whole ability to

gather news, from whatever group.
Q

Mr. Prettyman, going back to your prior statement

about the, quote, "bad grand jury conduct” down in Georgia or
some place.

Do you suggest that the Court can engage in

constitutional adjudication on a very important matter, on
the basis that some grand juries sometimes abuse their powers?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

I think that the Court can establish

a rule that whan a reporter, part of the press protected by
the Constitution, receives, during the course of his newsgathering duties, information in confidence, that that brings
the First Amendment into play, and he is protected —

Q

Rut that doesn't get to

my

question*

You seem

place great weight on the fact that one grand jury, that
yo", recited, abused its powers, and I would assume it's true
that '.:ome grand juries do.

Is that a basis for constitutional

adjindication?
HR.

: Well, but, Your Honor, 1 think, in a

ias of cases the Court j

2one precisely that»

i

think in Lament, Bantam Books, Bates , Dombrowski, Talley, what
trie Coart has dene is not to say that in. this particular
tetany© there has boon a suprression of a First Amendment
right.

X think what the Court has done in those cases is to

say that if you are going to engage in the type of governmental
interference involved in those cases, it is going to have a
future chilling effect; and therefore X think it is incumbent
upon the Court to look about, look not only to the instant
case, but to look at the kind of abuse that could be inherent
in a refusal to recognise the privilege.

1 think certainly it can look to what is likely to
happen if you ck* not establish the privilege here.

You've

got to remember, we're not trying to set a set rule here which
a rvewsaau can, for all time and under any circumstances, simply

ori the privi lego and go home.

If he asserts it without

warrant, if ha asserts it in a situation he’s not entitled to,,
tks it can b • c.3 fee trained by the court, and that's the kind of
adjp.dication that’s constantly going on in all kinds of cases.
Butt yes, 1 do think that in determining chilling
wifect, project for the future, that the Court can look at
what «tight well go on.

In a case, for example, where the

State, you recall, attempted to make the pamphleteer's name
■ a ■

appoar on fcjl e pamphlet, the court didn’t say that

■ bat particular instanee it would hurt the individual, it

36
sale! that that ivcaXd deter people In the future from engaging

in this hind of First .amendment exercise of rights.
h;.tr X do think, absolutely, that you can look at the;
kinds of abuses that not only have occurred but might likely
occur.
Q

Mr. Prettyman, in the Georgia case which you

mentioned, and about which the Chief Justice questioned you a
moment ago, if it's demonstrable that the grand jury simply
is not investigating any criminal activity or any legitimate
act, might it not be that all persons including reporters
would have a privilege against testifying in that situation?
fhat that might not depend on a peculiar reportorial privilege.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

If it was totally demonstrable that

the grand jury was acting in an oppressive manner, it would
fall even under the Massachusetts rule.

But l»d like to

point out, in that case, that it wasn’t demonstrable until
the grand jury, as soon as it got the doctor’s name, dismissed.
’*■“ was dismissed.

It wasn’t until it was all over, and until

then, on the surface it apparently looked as if they were
investigating narcotics.
But the first question was: Who told you that?
And as soon as the name came forward, that was the end of the.
grand jury.
3ind how you would ever demonstrate that in advance,
I don’t know.

37
If I could save a few minutes for rebuttal»
KB. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi Very well? Mr. Prettyman.
Mr. Hurley*
ORAL ARGUMENT 0? JOSEPH J. KfJRLEY, ESQ,,
GSs BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT:
MR. HURLEY?

MASSACHUSETTS

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court?
Hay 1 aay at the outset that, in my-view, there’s no
quenticn here whether a newsman*s confidences are going to be
.

not.

The real question is:

To what extent and

La:-;.,, by what means, and in what circumstances?
2 do say, however, with respect to the contention
that Mr. Pappas makes, that, as I understand his contention,
a newsman, merely by virtue of being a newsman, as an
indispensable part of his job, if you will, must be given the
privilege not to give evidence that he has acquired about crime
because he has acquired it, quote, "in confidence”, unquote.
And that the reason for this privilege-and the reason
it rises to the constitutional level is that without this
privilege there will be substantial interference, substantial
impairment of the right of free press.
Mow, the Conraonwe&lth fe position is, with respect,
that this Court is not in a position to rule as Judge Zirpoli
in the District Court opinion in Caldwell5. that it is
incliFp/raiablf; that a newsman, all newsmen, under all conditions,

38

have this privilege, qualified though it may be? that it is
essential to tiv- operation of a free press that newsmen have
this privilege.
1 submit that unless this Court can rule that such
v privilege is indispensable to the operation of a free press,
this case does not rise to the constitutional level•

And it

then become a matter, at least so far as the State courts are
concerned, for the States to determine whether and to what
esitent newsmen will be privileged, whether it's a qualified or
an absolute privilege, not to disclose evidence of crime that
they have obtained in confidence»
A matter, in other words, for legislation in the
States, end, absent legislation, a matter for the same judicial
protection afforded to any citizen against improper, oppressive,
unreasonable inquiry, whether it be by a grand jury or whether
it be on the witness stand in the course of a trial.

1 think I should state a few additional facts of the
kappas situation, because some of the facts that mv brother has
.riven 1 think may alter my view of the legal problem involved

her©*
And particularly the point as to the terms and
v / hi.ons uncles which Pappas entered the Black Panther

..•aadouarters on this night.
Mv brother stated, if X understood him correctly,
tv t vi/, «c;/./:/curt was that Pappas would be allowed into the

39

irfcers with the understanding he would
roporc nothing except a. police raid, and that if there were a
police raid all beds va: a off? and if ray brother roe-ant that it’s
Ills understanding that the agreement was that if there was a
raid, ny question of confidence ended, I submit that *s not what
the record shows•
And I think this difference is important, for this
rviacon %

1 say the record shows clearly that what. Pappas

agreed to do was to keep in confidence, not to report, anything
he saw or hoard inside that headquarters on that night, except
a police raid.
In other words, what Pappas was agreeing to do is
not. the ordinary newsman-confidential source situation? what
bapprs was agreeing to do was to silence himself as to Event A,
namely, what might go on inside that headquarters other than
in tho course of a police raid, as the price of a possible
story about Event e, the police raid.
What A*m merely saying is that if this Court should
disagree and rule that it is indispensable to a free press
that a reporter have such a privilege, then certainly the

Court should rule that that privilege does not extend to &
situation where a reporter seals his lips not for the purpose
o f •3 e 11 ing i 21 fo rm at i on which he is going to use in one way or
another at: a reporter, but where he silences himself as the
price of a story.

40
Because 1 submit the two a its substantially different.
And the second situation, the situation that existed
is almost like ‘She situation postulated by Mr. Justice
Marshalls

the reporter ah© sees a crime merely as a witness and

not as a newsman.
Q

This case, in other words, General Hurley,

differs from the other two, in that, as you understand the
record, Mr. Pappas promised not to write any newspaper stories

or anything else, even- changing identities and so on? just not
to write any newspaper stories about what he saw there.
MR. HURLEY:
Q

He agreed to —

By contrast with the other two casea, where it

was the publication of newspaper stories that triggered;
apparently, the grand jury investigation.

1 would drew a distinction • Suppose Pappas had been

really writing about the Black Panthers, and, as my brother said,
for all that the record knows, unlike Mr. Caldwell, Mr. Pappas
is certainly not an expert on the Black Panthers-,

1 don81 cay

that to disparage him, but merely to point out a fact.
But let8s suppose he were engaged in becoming an
expert on the Black Panthers- and.he said;

Look, let me in,

and let me find out what you people really do in there, and I
won’t report ii: but it will be useful to me.
oat your side.

I want to find

'1 want to ha able to report your side.

Not

specifically what goes on in hare, but just to enrich my
understanding of the Panthers, as background.
If he had done that, X would not be making the point
.I’m. now making.

But he didn’t.

And I think it’s important to

keep that in mind.
X would also like to develop, just somewhat a®re, the
foot situation, because the suggestion has been made, not so
much perhaps in my brother’s oral argument as in his brief and
:.:eply brief, that there may be some suspicion here as to how
seriously motivated this grand jury was, whether it was a fishisn
expedition, or possibly politically motivated.
:: would like to point out to Your Honors that the
reword shows that in Mew Bedford, in July of 1970, and speciy.i rally os

tie

on the 30th day of July , Pappas was brought.

4
in from Providence because there ware fires going on? and
na, him elf? was told by his own station * quote? “They seem
to be burning the city down”? unquote.
That doesn't ire an that there was a rash of accidental
fires? the only inference is there's something going on.
Particularly when you couple that with — and these are the
words his own counsel used at the hearing in the Superior Court
there was turmoil there j you went to report on the turmoil?
the disturbances? the disorders,

tod Pappas said yes.

So he's obviously called in, not to report another
great Haw Bedford fire? because there's something in the nature
of? if you will? a riot? a civil disorder going on.
The barricades that are mentioned.

My bother, at

one point in his brief? wants the Court to infer that these
nay have been police lines.

Well? obviously? the language of

the street barricade is not that of the police line.
But 1 think we can infer from Pappas's own testimony
in the Superior Court? as it appears in the record? that he
tried to get initially to the point where he was told to go
for the conference? the Panther headquarters? and he couldn't
got there because there was a barricade.

That * s not a police

line.
;f. left? and ho reported this fact to his station?
r,tola a few minutes leter to go back? they will now
•.I.; ;; :• in,

Tl&:tnot the way wa identify public authority.

Ivai tfcio becomes even clearer because the statement
that wao road, which Mr. Pappas did hear outside in the street,
and did report, said, in part, that they, the area people, will
let the polios into the area —» not into the store, as my
brother said, but into the area —* provided they have a search
warrant, provided they're gentlemanly, provided they bring the
press.
&cv, this ic not the language of a police line.

There

is no question, as our court noted, that there ware serious
civil disorders, that these involved exclusion of the public
from various areas of Hew Bedford? not by the police.

We were

dealing, in other words, with a situation amounting to, or
smacking of anarchy, civil revolution, if you will.
And, indeed, while it’s not in the record, the grand

jury that questioned or sought to question Pappas did return
some indictments against individuals in connection with
Penses.

was asked about

rhether there was ammunition in the Panther headquarters.
And while I'm on that point, again 1 submit to the
Court that there could have been no question in Mr. Pappas*
what he was being interrogated about before the grand

jury.
verh&vr

It’s true, the form of the subpoena was general? but

occurred in Raw Bedford at this time.

TmrZ kappas waa masked, and did respond , Was he there ,
and. how he happened to be there, and the circumstances and so
forth.,

So there was never any question in his mind that what

they wanted to knew from him, and the questions that ha was
ntked that he refused to answer, all related to what ha sew and
hoard in that Black Panther headquarters in this period of
three hours that he was there.

There never could have been

any doubt in hie mind, certainly at that point, as to what the
grand jury wanted to know from him.
And the fact that he refused to answer questions,
and the indictments I have referred to were nolle pressed by
the district attorney subsequently because of his decision that
there wasn’t enough evidence? and maybe if they had gotten
Pappas* evidence there would have been enough.

But there

certainly can't have been any question in his mind as to what
he was being asked about.
So far as the facts are concerned, therefore, I

Now, what happened was this:

Pappas — and, inciden­

tal ly, Pappat: bad already eiabs one appsaranoa before this grma
jury previously

then was summoned again*

Pappas got.the subpoena, and there was a motion to
quash.

Now, procedurally, the question before the Superior

Court judge was whether or not Pappas had a privilege, as h®
claimed, and there's no question h@ claimed it from the outset,
a qualified privilege not to give his evidence because he was
a newsman and because he got that evidence in confidence as a.
newsman,
Th© Superior Court, in affect, said*
fc sb so.

Look, lot's

There is no law giving you that pii±vil€

At least until now, and 1 say until this day, until this Court

As a matter of fact, Your Honor,

with respect, 1

think the inference that you can draw from all the evidence is
whet there was a need.

She situation 2’va outlined:

Pappas,

the evidence is, was the only non-Panther in the headquarters.
therefore 1 t;culd say that there was no occasion, there

is no occasion for the Commonwealth to meet any burden,

then there is no burden.

So the answer to ray question is you did not?

The Commonwealth has not.

Right.

General Err ley,

W

sas , Your Honor?

does Massachusetts»; procedure provide for

mjcrhi ■ n to quash a criminal subpoena on the ground of

MR. -SURLEYs

Yes, Your Honor.

1 think' our court

has recognised that in its decision in this case.
Q

End would Massachusetts procedure there require

•— supposing some other claim, other than a reporter's
privilege, were asserted? would Massachusetts procedure require
that the State bear the burden or that the person claiming the
oppressiveness or burden s omene s s bear the burden?
MR. HURLEY: Well, if Your Honor please» I would say
this 2

That the burden is and should be on the one who claims

fho exemption.

X say that should be true of a newsman or

anyone.
Suppose X were subpoenaed, for example, to testify
before a grand jury in the western part of the State on a
matter about which, obviously, I know nothing?

1 think the

burden is on me to come to the court and say?

Look, they’re

subpoenaing me, and 1 have no knowledge of this situation? why
do 2 have to make this, trip?
But X think the burden is on me, and then it would
be up to the court, the burden would not shift, but perhaps
the burden of going forward would shift to the Commonwealthz

so
Why era you, subpoenaing this individual?

Anci X third this is so different, whether there’s a
question of invocation of a right to maintain a confidence or
that I have nothing to contribute, I'm being harassed, they’ve
got the wrong man.
Q

Our court recognises this*

Of course, X suppose Pappas's position is that

h© did make some sort of a showing, of the nature of burdensome*
ness or oppressiveness.

And, as Justice Marshall pointed out,

the State cam® back with nothing.
MR. HURLEYs
Your Honor?

Well, has he made a showing, really,

Or has.the press at all made a showing?

Beyond

the statement that it is necessary that we have this right or
our news sources: are going to dry up.
I mean, Pappas said that.

He said that, himself,

before the Superior Court judge who heard it.
what does that really prove?

But does that ~~

X mean, if you will, go beyond

■'

the record in this case, and X say there’s nothing really here
that proves that there is a need for such a privilege.
But let's go into the Caldwell affidavit, and if you
take the affidavits of the many eminent and respected newsmen
there, 1 was struck by this facts
jlaying

that each on© there is

of information in confidence.

':,X get a great deal

Unless you give me a privilege,

51

confidence.{s
But the short answer is, not to give a short answer,
there's no privilege now, as was pointed out this morning,
there never has been, and yet they're getting the information.
So that, to say wWa1re not going to get information
in the:* future unless you recognise this privilege14, it seems
to me is not a logical consequence from the fact they've
been getting information over the years in confidence, even
though there is no privilege.
2 wonder, as a practical matter, how much attention
does the informant pay to this question at all?

I wonder, for

example, if the Panthers had been asked that nights

Now, do

you really expect that not only is Paul Pappas not going to

testify about it?

Of if he's questioned, for example, there .

was mentioned, if there was a fight or an injury or a murder,
that he's not going to answer police questioning? is that what
you really mean?
They didn't say that. The language of the agreement
was "report", and X really wonder how much attention informants
pay to this privilege.
Q

And X want to point —

Bow much attention do you think the Black

Panthers would pay to Pappas if he testified?
MR. HURLEY:

I'm sure, Your Honor, that he- would- —

52
if he testifiedf the Black Panthers would be unhappy.

But —

■[Laughter. J
as was pointed out in the Caldwell case, and 1
think it's important here, that the Panthers present an unusually
sensitive news source, and it seems to me the Caldwell decision,

56

at the appendi:.-: in galdwell, ail the 121 subpoenas that were
served on NBC and ABC over 31 months — first, of all, only 72

of them were in sr'ir.iinal cases? 18 in grand juries.

And 43

of them in criminal cases were by the defendant, not by the
prosecution.

And out of all those that were served by the

prosecution, and: there are 121, excluding three that came out
of the Caldwell grand jury, there*s only one that X would
describe as possibly seeking confidential information from a
reporter.
And that was a subpoena to a station to bring in, in
effect, everything you've got on the Mafia, Cosa Nostra,, and
some other named individuals.
The only one that you could possibly say, of all these
.121, only seven of them were subpoenas ad testificandum, and
those ware all served by defendants in criminal cases.

Can it really be said that every newsman, to do his

Bsoarcs the r.awsman privilege would be greater than my

Thank you, Mr, Hurley.

Excuse me. We're

Mr. Reynolds.

Z t-xl,g it that you're going to focus your argument,
•;„3 a friend of the Court, specifically as it relates to this

OEM,

argument of william

Bradford Reynolds,

esq,

,

ON BEE&LP CP THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
ME, REYNOLDS:

Right.

Your Honor, I believe that;

my argument earlier will pertain equally to this case as it
did to the former case.

The general question of whether a

constitutional privilege should be recognized in the First
Amendment♦
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

All 1 had in mind is that

you need not repeat your former argument.
MR. REYNOLDS:

No, I really intend merely to make a

couple of additional observations, noting that my former
argument applies here equally.
Our position is, of course, that no constitutional
privilege exists in the First Amendment now, and on© should not
foe recognised.
2 -chink a point that should be brought out is that
even apart from that the arguments in these cases, talking

about the constitutional privilege, focus on a particular test
of some showing that the government must make.
Generally a balancing test that is exceedingly
difficult to apply,

balancing test which is found nowhere

with respect to any other personal privileges, privileges
pertaining to personal relationships,
Particularly a distinction is made between serious

zn€. less sarione crino-.-», between what are called major crimes

60
or victimless crimes, I believe, that5s how it’s characterized
in the briefs.

A distinction which, as far as. I can determine,

is wholly detached from legislative judgment.
If Congress has seen fit to make a victimless crime,
as it's referred to, that a crime as a matter of determination,
fchir legislative determination, and it’s constitutional. We
see no basis for drawing lines in formulating some
constitutional rule which would distinguish between something
that is a major crime as opposed to a victimless crime.
Also, this rule turns on a showing by the government
that no other sources of information are available.
Suppose you have an informer who’s unreliable, and
you want to call a reporter in order to show reliability? Or
supposing the informer is in fact reliable, but he would make
■

bad witness?

Is this a situation where we should say that

there are no other sources available?
And what about the whole notion of cumulative evidence,
and the importance of that?

How is a judge to measure whether

or not cumulative evidence is or is not important, in
determining the function of the grand jury?
1 think that these are extremely difficult questions
in trying to formulate a test of the nature that's proposed,
as a matter of constitutional law.
And then, moreover, Mr. Prettyman pointed out, the
trlrnoinc: tost in one that turns on the particular facts of

SI
each cas 3, ad hoc te?;t, wMoh o'-r^e; 0 to suggest that these wouXfl
always be a lltlgable i ts?i3 involved.» resulting in substantial
and considerable delay, and such delays, wa feel? weald make
an important difference , when you * re talking about the grand
jwry process.
The statutes of limitation run; you have problems of
questions of speedy trials, and determinations of that nature,
which make a difference, a substantial difference when you're
talking about a grand jury ao opposed to an investigation by a
legislative committee, where it is looking into. the matters
which result in legislation.

It seems that those considerations are important ones,
when you’re trying to formulate some kind of a constitutional

test „
I would just point out that such delays can be
avoided and probably would bsf avoided under the guidelines
that the Attorney General has proposed»

You would not have such

litigabis interruptions.
We think that that is an important distinction
between the constitutional proposition that is presented and
the guidelines that were spoken of earlier.
That’s all.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER* Thank you, Hr. Reynolds.
Mr. Prattynan, you have about three minutes left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.,
Or! BEft&LF OF THE PETITIONER
Ml, PRSTTYMMls

1 have only two brief points, Your

Honory in response to Mr. Justice Stewart.
My brother over here indicated that this was an
instance of Mr* Pappas silencing himself *3 the price of the
story*
There’s nothing improper in that.

There was a case

a few years ago where a camera crew want into a Massachusetts
mental hospital and agreed in advance to keep in confidence,
not to publish the actual faces and names of the people in
there; to reserve that confidence.
You can imagine a labor leader who’s still at home
and the press is clamoring for an interview, and he might says
Come in, you can set up your cameras and have an interview?
but not in relation to my family.

That’s anything you see

or hear is in confidence; they are not part of the story.
This hind of thing, where you impose a confidence in
regard to on® thing in order to get the larger story, is
very common, and part of getting and disseminating the news.
Q

But in this ease, Mr. Prettyroan, there never

was a story, larger or smaller.
MR. PRETTYM&N:

But that was only by the happenstance

that the raid didn't coma off, not
Q

Yes, yes, 1 understand.

63
MB. PKSTTYM&Nt

If there had been a raid that night,

could w© possibly say that the constitutional issue turns on
tha fact that the raid was there and he covered it and published
it, whereas, because the police

was there? I don't know — didn't
Q

My question didn't imply that I thought there

was any impropriety.

I was just differentiating this case from

the other two, insofar as that in the other two cases there
were stories published in the newspapers *
MR, PRETTYMAN:

No question about that®

The only other thing I want to say is that 2 submit
to you that it’s more important than an occasional indictment,
that an Earl Caldwell be allowed to do in-depth stories on the
Black Panthers, that Mr. Bransburg be allowed to show that
hashish is available, readily available to kids in two counties
in Kentucky, that Mr. Pappas be allowed to report a police

Why do you suppose, Mr. Prettyman —» maybe

you've indicated it already? but what, in your view, accounts
for the fact that this basic question is arising now for the
first time, after almost 200 years since we had a First
and had a free press and had grand juries?
vih PliETTYMANs
factors, Your Hc.nc-r.

Yes.

1 think there are a number of

In the first place, I think there has

been much agreement between prosecutors and newsmen over the
years in the pact,

1 think that, in addition to that, that there has
been a flood of subpoenas more recently, as we get into the
problem of minorities arid radical groups, we have our reporters
today doing things they never did before, reporters themselves
~~ X used to foe one -- will tell you that our reporters today
are much more investigative, more sophisticated, more daring,
tare's Pappas, who put his life on the life by being inside a
headquarters in order to report from th© inside.
This, I think, is of relatively recent origin, when
caahAaed, also, with the concept on the part of the prosecutor
that here is a man who's on the scene, and who could provide
,:i.. available investigative am of the government.

All these

things have come to the front at a sudden .time, just in the
ray that, perhaps in Griswold, the question which you think
fcuXd cjo back for a hundred years did not arise until that
particular case.

65

Q

It's a combination of things that have all

coalesced about the same time?
MR„ PE1YTYM&M* That5 8 correct.
&nd as

my

brother suggested a few minutes ago* here

in the course of a year and a half NBC and CBS were getting
four subpoenas a month recently.
of subpoenas back in the old days.

They didn't get those kind
123 subpoenas between

January 569 and July of 8 70.
.and if thin Court affirms this case, 1 can assure
you that reporters will bo spending a lot more time in grand
juries and courtrooms than they are in reporting from now on.
Q

Mr. Prettyman, another hypothetical, since we've

got to test all of these propositionss

Suppose on going into

the headquarters the reporter was horrified to find, as I am
sure he would be horrified if he found what I'm about to
suggest, a great arsenal that had 20 flame, throwers, SO machine
virus, a whole stack of automatic rifles, cases and bosses full
of dynamite for making bombs.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Prettyman.

Mr. Prettyman, if X can bother you with one

more question —
MR. PRETTYMANs Certainly.
Q

~~ X 'rendered about your reference to the

Wiseman case — and I think it was the Wiseman case
HR. PRETTYMAN:
Q

It was. the Cerejaonwealth vs. —

— as an example of the routine effect of an

off-the-record or, rather, an agreed private filming.
hero the newsman is relying on the confidential
•..grsfcscnt, the agreement as to. confidence•

There he broke it.

And, hence, I wonder whether your reference to it is rather an
unfortunate on©?
■ HR. PR3TTYHAR:

Mo, I think, if I may suggest it,

it5 s a very fortunate one because the confidence was deemed
j£ ouch order in that case that they actually enforced it.'

In other words, X'sa using tha case as an illustration that a

rather than being improper and a way to silence

thm reporter was, in that ease, a way of getting a larger

if they

Q

My point was the reporter made the deal and

ME. PPJ3TTYM&N:

Ho question about it.

That's right.

But I think the fact that he attempted to break it,
mil that the- court saw it of such a, high order to enforce it

by injunction -«*
Q

rut did you not have some other intervening

First Amendment rights of other people?

The rights of these

yrisonars not tv ba on television, standing around in the nude
e, herded almost in animal-like fashioi
r.’my other indignities.

& a great

There4s a very great difference with

the intervention of the individual rights of those prisoners,
MR. PSETTYMMt Quite true.

And you're going to have

instances of clashes in these cases occasionally, between the
•:»ixth i'uvssnd'uent right to call Witnesses, First Amendment right
of the reporter.

This is nothing new.

These kinds of clashes

out balances are quite common in constitutional adjudication,
the kind that the courts face constantly.
fx.C: the courts are facing them right now, below*

And finally, & might say, deciding them in our favor.
