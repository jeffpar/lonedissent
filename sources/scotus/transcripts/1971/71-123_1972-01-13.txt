PROCEED inns
MRc CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
•

We will bear arguments

'l

next in 71-123, National Labor Relations Board against Burns
International and Burns against the Board in 71-198.
Mr. Corae, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
■MR. COME;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case is here on writs of certiorari to the
Second Circuit.

/

It presents two questions concerning the

extent to which the duty to bargain under the National Labor
Relations Act survives a change in employers.
The first question is whether Burns International
Protective Agency, which took over Wackenhut*s job of furnish'
ing guard services to ^Lockheed is a successor to Wackenhut
for purposes of the National Labor Relations Board; and
second, if Burns is a successor employer, is it obliged
not only to recognize and bargain with the union represented
by Wackenhut*s employees but also obliged to honor the
collective bargaining agreement which Wackenhut had entered
into with the union, covering these employees.
Q

Mr. Come, perhaps this question is a little

too early, but if you will bear it in mind and answer it
when you want, if Burns had not employed any of the Wackenhut
people—they employed 27 I think, or some such figures—

if they had not employed any, would you contend they were a

4
successor employer because they moved in and performed the
••• v “

same function?
MR. COME:

I v/ould say the fact that they—well,

as I will develop further, the continuity of the employing
enterprise is the test and among the factors that are very
crucial, there is the complement of the work force and had
they not employed for non-discriminatory reasons, the
Wackenhut employees, that would be a big factor for holdincr
that they were not a successor.

Whether it would, he conclu­

sive or not, I will develop as I get to it.
The basic facts here are these:

Prom July 1,
-.1

1962 to July 1, 1967, Wackenhut, a nationwide guard service,
provided plant protection services for Lockheed Aircraft
Service Corporation, a subsidiary of the Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation, at its facility at the Ontario Airport in
California.

What Lockheed was doing there was maintaining

and repairing planes, and Wackenhut was supplying guard service
for the Lockheed operation.
On March 8, 1967, the Board certified the United
Plant Guard Workers as the exclusive bargaining representa­
tive of the Wackenhut employees working at the Lockheed Air­
port facility.
G

How large a unit was that?

MR. COME: It was a unit of about 42 employees.
On April 29, 1967, about a month after the

5
certification,, Wackenhut and the union entered into a 3-year
collective bargaining agreement covering these employees and
the collective bargaining agreements, among other things,
contained a clause making the agreement binding on successors
and assigns.

Lockheed’s then current service contract with

Wackenhut was due to expire on June 10,.1967, unless extended
by Lockheed.

In May of 1967,. Lockheed invited various guard

services, including Wackenhut, to rebid the job.

On May 15,

Lockheed -aclvisell the prospective bidders, including Burns,
that Waekenhufc's guards were represented by the United Plant
Guards Workers who had been certified by the Board and that
there was an outstanding collective bargaining agreement
between Waekenhufc and the Union covering those employees.
Although Wackenhut submitted a bid, the successful bidder was
Burns.
In the next month of June,

1967, Burns sought to

employ, when it took over on July 1, as many of the Waekenhufc
awards as possible for the reason that they had the security
and top security clearance that was needed for this type of
work.

The Wackenhut guards applied for jobs with Burns, as

they did so, Burns officials, in turn assisted the American
Federation of Guards, another union with whom Wackenhut had a
contract covering its employees in Los Ange3county.

The

contract did not cover these employees because this was in
San Bernadino County.

But none the less, Burns assisted the-

consideration of guards in obtaining membership applica­
tions from the Wackenhut guards as they carae to apply for jobs
with Burns.

Representatives of Burns told the guards that

could not get uniforms without signing American Federation of
Guards membership cards and that they had to join the
American Federation of Guards .in order to work for Burns.
On June 29, Burns' Branch Manager concluded that
a majority of the employees to be used at the Lockheed Airportjob had signed American Federation of Guards membership appli­
cations or were already members of that union, recognized,
the American Federation of Guards as their bargaining repre­
sentative.
Wackenhut terminated its guard service at midnight
on June 30 and Burns began to furnish such service on July 1.
On that date, Burns9 Lockheed force, like Wackenhut *s
consisted of 42 guards.

Of the 42, 27 or more than a majority

had formerly been employed by Wackenhut, and 19 guards wore
transferred from other Bixrns jobs.

The Burns guards performed

essentially the same tasks at the same stations that the
_

/

Wackenhut guards had performed.

Moreover, although Bxirns

used its own supervisors, theirbfunctions and responsibilities
were similar to those of their Wackenhut predecessors.
Both utilized area supervisors who performed similar functions
and both had full-time supervisors on the Lockheed job with
similar

funcfcions,

7
Q

And hov? many of the former Wackenhut guards

signed up with the other union? of the 27?
MR. COME:
Q

I believe all of them did? your Honor.

All 27?

PR. COME t Yes, your Honor.
Q

And of course 15 brought over by Burns were

already members?
MR. COME :

They were already members.

They were

apparently transferred from Los Angeles County and thus
were under the Burns contract with the American Federation
of Guards, which I believe had a union security clause in
it, as did the United. Plant Guard contract with Wackenhut.
On July 12, the United Plant Guard Workers requested
that Burns recognize it as the bargaining representative of
the Burns employees of Lockheed, and honor the collective
bargaining agreement that it had with Wackenhut.

Burns refused

and the union then filed Fair Labor Practice charges with the
Board„
The Board found that Burns violated Section R (a)
{2) and (1) of the Act, which prohibits i 1 lecra 1 assistance
by an employer to a labor organization by assisting the
American Federation of Guards in organizing and by recog­
nising American Federation of Guards when it did not represent
an uncoerced majority of Burns5 employees.

This finding

was sustained by the Court of appeals and it is not in issue

8

here„
The Board also found that a bargaining unit limited
to the guards working at the Lockheed Airport facility was
appropriate, that Burns continued essentially the same, opera­
tion at that plant that Wackenhut had, and therefore it was a
successor employer to Wackenhut. Accordingly, the Board held
that Burns violated Section 8

{a}

(5) and (1) of the Act by

refusing to recognise and bargain with the United Plant Guards
Finally, the Board, drawing support from this Court
decision in which Lee against Livingston, which I will get to
later, the Board held that as a successor to Wackenhut, Burns
was obliged to honor the collective bargaining agreement
between Wackenhut and the United Plant Guards Workers and
that by refusing to do that, that was an additional violation
of the bargaining obligation.
The Court of Appeals opinion by Judge Hays sustained .the .
Board’s findings as indicated, of illegal assistance, sustained
the Board's findings that Burns was a successor, sustained the
finding that there was a refusal to bargain and in Burns
refusing to recognise United Plant Guard Workers as the
representative of the employees, but held that the Board had
exceeded its powers under the statute in finding that there was
a further refusal to bargaining in failure to honor the
collective bargaining agreement.
Both the successor issue and the propriety of the

9

Board's findings requiring a contract to ba honored are before
this Court on cross-petitions for certiorari.
Nov as this Court knows, enacting the National Labor
Relations Act, Congress made the policy declaration? Section
1 of the S.ctf that protection by law of the right of employees
to organise and bargain collectively safeguards commerce from
interruption by removing a frequent source of industrial strife.
The way the Act implements

that policy is to provide a

procedure whereby the Board can conduct a secret ballot election?
to get the employees5 wishes concerning a bargaining
representative.

If a majority vote for them? it certifies

them as the exclusive bargaining representative and under
Section 8 (a)

(5) of the Act? its refusal to bargain? to refuse

to honor the certification.
Furthermore, since the Act also rests on the. premise
that industrial peace is promoted by maintaining stability
in the bargaining relationship, a Board certification is
normally

not subject to challenge for one year.

This Court

endorsed the Board’s rule to that effect in the Brooks case,
or longer if there is a collective bargaining agreement of
reasonable duration and under Board principles that have been
approved by the Courts, a collective bargaining agreement of
up to three years is normally regarded as reasonable duration.
Q

May I get this clear.

Under the Court of Appeals

decision, the only issue as to which we cannot agree with the

10

Board was whether although Burns has to recognize--is this
United Plant- Guards —
MR. COME;
Q

Yes, your Honor.

—and has to deal with the United Plant ; Guards

and not the old American, whatever it was, nevertheless it will
work out a new agreement, and that is between the Plant Guards
and Burns, and that Burns was authorised to simply carry on
the old agreement that the Union had made with Wackenhut, is
that it?
MR. COME:

That is right, your Honor.

f.

Q

And it“s the cross-petition of Burns that tills

agrees with so much of the order that says that Burns has to
deal 'with this Union?
MR. COME:
Q

That’s right, your Honor.

And are those the only two questions that v/e have?

MR. COME:.

Yes, your Honor, those are the only two

questions as I understand it.
Now in line with the general principles that I have
just outlined, had Burns remained the employer, it would have
been obliged to recognise’, the United Plant. Guards Workers
during the life of the three-year collective bargaining
agreement, notwithstanding any changes in complement of the
employees that occurred during the life of that agreement, and
if Wackenhut had repudiated that agreement or had unilaterally
modified its wage provisions or any other provisions relating

11

to the employees' terms and conditions of employment, it wow3d
not only have been subject to a suit for breach of the
•yjreement, under Section 301 of the Labor Management delations
Act, but it would have violated Section 8 (d) and therefore
8 (a)

(5) of the National Labor Relations Act as well, because

Section 8 (d) provides in relevant part that where there is in
effect a collective bargaining contract, the duty to bargain
collectively

shall mean that no party to such contract shall

terminate or modify such contract without giving prescribed
ic-fcice and waiting until the expiration date of such contract,
me! as I understand it, nothing in tills Court's recent decision
in Pittsburgh Plate Glass affects the. general principle because
this contract, almost exclusively, dealt with mandatory .
subjects of bargaining,
Nov?, I don't understand that Burns disagrees with
what 1 have just been setting forth as the obligation that
would have been imposed on Wackenhufc nor do I understand -that
there is any disagreement with the next point that X am going
to make, namely, that early in the administration of the Act,
■ho. Board evolved the doctrine and it has been uniformaly
approved by the Courts of Appeals, although this Court has
co:- .had occasion specifically to pass on it, that the mere
transfer of operations
on
Relations Act.

. ^frora one employer to another does nof

ch i;o, o o:o to bargain Under the National Labor
If such transfer leaves substantially

12
intact the identity of the employing enterprise, then the duty
of the original employer to recognize and bargain with an
incumbent union devolves upon the new employer as a successor
employer, and the rationale for the doctrines simply is this:
that if employing enterprise remains intact, continuation of
the bargaining obligation serves the policy of averting
industrial strife in that enterprise no less than by imposing
the obligation upon the successor employer' than did imposing
it on tlie original employer.

Moreover, where you have main­

tained the employing enterprise, there is little reason to
believe

that the employees’ original choice of a bargaining

representative would have bean altered by the mere change in
employers.
The point at which the difference between us develops;
is what

are the criteria for determining whether you have a

successor employer for purposes of the National Labor Relations;
Act , and it also gats back to the Chief Justice’s question.
Q

Before you go on with that, Mr. Come, what you

have said sounds as though you are talking about a case in
which Burns came in and took over and along with the take­
over of the activity, took over employees.

Nov/ my reading of

this record is that Burns is one of the competing bidders.
A great many people bid for this contract and these companies
awarded it to Burns as the low bidder, so they were competitors
of the Company you now suggest ia the Company to which they

are successor»
The 2? employees were then taken over on the open
labor market, weren't they?
MR. COME:
Q

That is correct, your Honor.

Than they were hired one by one?

I just wanted

to foe sure 1 understood that correctly.
MR. COME:

Yes, you have, your Honor, and it’s

Burns’ point that that does make a difference, that that
distinction should foe drawn between this kind of situation and
one where you have a more conventional transfer assets or of
facilities«
We submit and we believe that the cases in the Court
of Appeals support our submission, that so long as the new
employer ends up substantially with the,same bargaining unit
or industrial community, as it is sometimes called, he is a
successor employer for purposes of the National Labor Relations
Act, whether he does that as a result of direct dealing with
the prior employer, or he does it through dealing with a third
party, as was done in this case, because the important thing,
as I tried to indicate, the important rationale for writing
this gloss of the successor: employer on the bargaining
obligation, is that the change in employer has not made a
significant change in the bargaining unit which had originally
selected the Union as the employees5 representative and that
is what we had here, because irrespective of how Burns ended

14
up with the contract and the findings of the Board, as
sustained by the Court of Appeals, you had a situation where,
and X era quoting from the Court of Appeals Appendix, Burns
and Wackenhut are nationwide organisations, both.

Both perform

the identical services at the same facility, namely, providing
plant protection service to Lockheed.although Burns used its
own supervisors, their functions and responsibilities were
similar to those performed by their predecessors, and finally
jr

and .perhaps most significantly, Burns commenced performance
of the contract with 27 former Wackenhut employees out of its
total complement of 42.

Moreover, as shown by Burns’ assistance

to the American Federation of Plant Guards, it too recognized
this Lockheed operation as a separate operation, as a separate,
bargaining unit, so that we submit that since the change from
'bckenhufc to Burns left substantially intact the employment
conditions at the enterprise that is involved here, namely,
supplying of the guard services to Lockheed, -which was a
separate unit, the Board properly found that Burns is a
successor to Wackenhut, which brings me to the second question
as to whether Burns was not only obligated to recognize and
bargain with United Plant

Guard Workers Union, and prohibit

it from making any unilateral changes in existing working
conditions without first bargaining with the Union, but whether
it was also obliged to honor the contract,
Q

TSov; much longer did this contract have to run,

15

this collective bargaining agreement at the time Burns was
awarded the basic contract by Lockheed?
MR. COME:
I would say.

It had been about two and a half- years,

It was entered into in-—it’s Oven more ’than two

and a half years—it was entered into in April 29, 1967, and
Burns took over on
Q

July 1, 1967.

And it was a three-year?

MR. COME:

It was a three-year contract.

There would

be no question that Wackenhut would have been required to
honor the contract for the three-year term.
Q

Was it raopenable by either party at all during

that three-year period?
MR. COME:

As I recall, it was not.

These three-

year contracts are not uncommon in collective bargaining.
There was a time when a one-year contract was the rule, then it
went to two years and now three„years is very standard.
Q

The invitation to bids went out after the

agreement had been signed?
MR. COME:
Q

After the new agreement had been signed.

Any evidence that anyone knew there were going

to be invitations to bid?
MR. COME:

Before they signed?-

Yes, your Honor.

(Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.ra. the same day.)

16
AFTERNOON SESSION

£1:00 p.m
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
-

continue.

Mr. Come, you may

*

You have six-minutes remaining of your total time.
MR. COME:

I should like to respond to Mr. Justice

Brennan's question and reserve the balance of my time.
At the luncheon break Justice Brennan asked whether
there was any indication that bids would be let at. the time
the collective bargaining agreement was entered into.
So far as the record shows, there was no indication,
other than the fact that the Lockheed contract with Wackenhut
was a year contract that was subject to removal.

However, for

the last five years Wackenhut had been retained to perform the
guard service at this installation, and from, all that appears
in the record it had every intention of remaining.
Q

Had previous contracts included successors and

assigns?
MR. COME:

That the record does not show, Your

Honor.
Q

Do they show whether there was snv special

attention given to the inclusion of that provision in this
contract?
MR. COME: The record does not.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gregory.

17
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GORDON A. GREGORY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF UPGWA, RESPONDENT AND INTERVENOR
MR. GREGORY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The United States Chamber of Commerce, in its amicus
brief, stated, and I quote;

"In a service industry such as

the providing of plant protection service, generally the only
variable in which productivity of efficiency gains can be made
is labor.*
1 submit, Your Honors, that in this case the labor

gains that have been made have been made at the sacrifice of
rights that are federally protected and rights which this
Court sought to stabilise in its Wiley decision.
In my view, there are classic facts here of Wackenhut
Corporation having had a contract for guard services for a
number of years on an unorganised basis.

The guards that my

client represents organized those people, they were certified
by the National Labor Relations Bcord, they entered into
negotiations for their first contract, which did contain a
successors and assigns clause, and without at least a control
of participation of the parties Liclheed elected to let its
contract with Wackenhut up for bids„
Following the premise that the only commodity these
guard agencies have is labor, Burns then was in a position to
ignore the stability created by the bargaining agreement, and

IB
effectively then to bid on the basis of labor only.
The result was that the employees lost the benefits
of the gains they had made through the collective bargaining
process.
X suggest that a doctrine that a successor-employer,
and assuming for the moment that Burns was a successor, albeit
e non-consenting party to what has clearly bean held to be a
nonconsansaal agreement and rather a public obligation, does
not do violence to clear concepts of federal labor law policy
as they were established prior to the time of the Burns
decision.
Because prior to that time, in a successor situation,
it was held that the successor was bound to jreccgnise and to
bargain with the incumbent union.

It was held that the successor

was bound to recognize existent terms and*conditions of employ\

whether or not these term's and conditions of employment
were established by a bargaining agreement or otherwise.
Q

Weil, not in service situations, you have it in

mergers and purchases of assets.

Right?

MR. GREGORY: Well, Your Honor, if I understand the
question, I had understood that,in, for example, the Board8s
decision in Maintenance, the physical acquisition of assets was
not essential to a finding of successorship, nor was privity,
which was -Q

I know, but there was a deal — was there a deal

19

there between the predecessor and the successor?
MR. GREGORY:
Q

Not in Maintenance, Incorporated.

Well, what about in the government contract eases?

MR. GREGORY:

In Emerald Maintenance;. I don’t be­

lieve there was privity or an understanding between the
successor or predecessor in that case.
Q

I mean, what about the Board decision in

government contract cases, where, on government bid one person
replaces another, and the successor is held not to be bound?
MR. GREGORY:

Yes, that decision was subsequent,

of course, to the determination in Burns.

I believe the case

is on appeal, and —
Q

Well, it didn’t overrule any prior cases, did

it?
MR. GREGORY:
Q

No, it didn't overrule Burns.

Well.

MR. GREGORY:

It distinguished, I think, Your Honor,

on the basis of "unusual circumstances."

Of course I

personally disagree that there were unusual circumstances to
warrant a departure from Burns.

And hopefully that matter

will be set forth on appeal.
But i don’t see any distinction between Emerald
Maintenance, and what the Board had held earlier in Maintenance
Incorporated.
Q

And then as set forth in Burns, where they —
What would you say if Burns had a collective

20

bargaining agreement with another union that gave the other
union the bargaining rights with respect to any of its
installations in California, and then it won this bid with
Lockheed?
MR, GREGORY:

Well, that was asserted below, Your

Honor, and rejected —
Q

Well, I know it was rejected, but let's assume

that it was true,
MR, GREGORY: This, I would sav, would be one of the
numerous factors to determine whether or not initially there
was a successorship involved, and whether the collective
bargaining agreement of the predecessor bore a reasonable
relation to that of the predecessor,

I don't believe --

well, it's not the case before the Court, because here you had
a completely separate facility.
And if I might add on that point, first, Waekenhufc
and the plant guards negotiated a collective bargaining
agreement, which 3: think we can assume was tailored to the
needs of plant protection services at that facility,
Q

Well, was the wage scale of Burns actually

lower than Wackenhut?
MR. GREGORY:

Yes.

The record shows it was 10 to

12 cents lower, and then at the future date, some two months
after its takeover. Burns did raise the wages to the level of
its predecessor, and maintained them there for a time —

21
q

Was that wage rate higher than Burns® other

estahXishments ?
MR. GREGORY:

Yes, it was.

It was higher than the

so-called Ontario sub-office, that they would rely upon

as

being the more appropriate unit.
Q

What would you sav if the Burns ---- if the wage

rates at Waekenhut had bean lower than the Burns rates?
MR. GREGORY:

Had they been lower, the employees

would have beer, stuck with them. They had negotiated them, and
Burns could then pay those wages at that particular facility,
if, in fact, they were a successor.
Q

Yes.

But you wouldn't •— but I suppose the

union would have objected, but I'm not sure the employees would
have objected if they had been included in the Burns bargaining
unit.
MR. GREGORY:

Perhaps not, Your Honor, but a

companion case with Burns was the Dura Kota Division, wherein
the union desired not to be bound by collective bargaining
agreement where there had been a change in ownership? and the
Board has indicated that the rule set forth in Burns would
apply equally to unions as well as employers,

And I submit

that is a correct rule.
Q

Well, except that the Board, as I understand it,

has given itself a little leeway in the Emerald Maintenance
i.o that correct?

22
MR. GREGORY:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

lff in other words, the wage rates that Wackenhu

was paying were lower, as a result of the fact that Wadkenhufc
was a failing company or some other extraordinary reason, the
Board has held that this Burns doctrine will not be applicable:
hasn’t it?
MR. GREGORY:

Yes, it has.

I would point out, Your

Honor, that that involved an application of the Service
Contract Act.

In fact, I submit, a misunderstanding of what

that Act involves; basically it's a minimum wage or DavisBacon Actt for service industry employees working under
government contract.

And of course those factors were not

present in the Burns case.
Indeed, we had two sophisticated, well-established,
giant guard agencies.

And I would make the point that Burns

not only had advance knowledge, but with the sophistication
and experience was in a position to adapt to the situation
of the collective bargaining agreement that was present.
Q

Mr. Gregory, that language, "successors and

assigns", has that language historically been the kind of
language used to describe successors in this context?

Or is

that standard lawyer's work in contracts and documents of all
kinds?
MR. GREGORY:

Mr. Chief Justice, in my opinion it is

standard, it's been a form of boilerplate, I think we've placed

23
in bargaining agreements, although until Wiley, at least,
until Burns there may have been doubt whether, as a matter of
law, it would bind the nonconsenting successor or assigns.
More ideally in our bargaining agreements we
attempted to make it a condition, of sale or assignment that
the predecessor would see that the successor adopt it.
But, realistically, and in terms of placing this
Court's Wiley decision and the rationale there of promoting
industrial stability through arbitration, and of giving
employees some modicum of protection against changes in owner­
ship, I submit Burns is in harmony with that doctrine.
Because under Wiley if there has to be arbitration for the
successor, it's implicit there cannot be that arbitration unless
the bargaining agreement survives.
Q

Well, there’s a continuity factor from the

standpoint of the employeer» too, is there not?

That is.

Burns, having established relationship with other unions, or
anyone in the posture of Burns, might have seme real problems
if they had to divide up and deal with a .number of unions•
would they not?
MR. GREGORY:

If I understand the question, Your

Honor, Burns I don’t believe would be any worse off in that
situation unless you are alluding to the American Federation
of Guards

— or perhaps I didn’t
Q

understand the question.

Well, I’m speaking to this particular union?

24
tout assume they had a union that, was part of the American
Federation of Labor, an established, recognized, acknowledged
union, you have some jurisdictional problems then, wouldn’t
you?

If they came in with a contract that they were obliged

to recognise that union in any acquisitions that they came to,
if they acquired any hew plants or branches or agencies»
MR» GREGORY:

I don’t believe they would, Your Honor»

The client I represent has had experience with Burns throughout
the country where we have other units, and I know of my own
knowledge that Burns has other unions besides AFG and the
UPGWA.

But 1 don’t believe that potential threat, if it is,

can destroy the fact there Was continuity of identity of an
employing enterprise, there was previously an appropriate
unit certified by the National Labor Relations Board.
Moreover, I would point out that the Act contains
adequate machinery for dealing with jurisdictional disputes
as soon as they develop.
Q

Would your position be the same if five or six

or seven of the employees of Burns had gone over to Wackenhut
instead of twenty-some?
MR. GREGORY:

Yes, it would be, Your Honor.

I think

that the
Q

Well, then, how about none?

How about if

there were no employees?
MR. GREGORYs

Well, that was the situation in

25
Monroe Sander, for example, decided by the Second Circuit,
where the possible, either refusal to employe

or transfer to a

new location or to the successor in turn miqht be either an
unfair labor practice or, as I understand Wiley, a breach of
the collective bargaining agreement, or a matter subject to
arbitration,
So I would not state that a head count is absolutely
essential to the operation of the successorship concept.
May 1 conclude by indicating that in situations such
as presented here it would appear to rae a certain stability
is created, not only for the employees on whose behalf I
argue but for those employers who operate in the service
industry area which is highly competitive, but typified
generally by competition based on labor rates, rates of
people who, generally speaking, are barely above the minimums
to begin with.
So I would submit there could be stability for the
employer.

Moreover, sophisticated parties in the field of

labor relations so enter into voluntary adjustments to adapt
to such parochial changes as might take place with a change in
ownership; and, finally, this Court has made it clear in
Wiley that the arbitration machinery is to be fostered and is
of course available and binding upon a successor to correct
these situations.
1 submit that Burns has finally placed an entire

26
National Labor Relations Act in harmony with the federal labor
policy generally, which is to promote and foster bargaining
through agreements and informal arbitration of disputes.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr, Gregory.
Mr. Bakaly,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES G. BAKALY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT BURNS
MR. BAKALY:

Mr. Chief Justice, rnay it please the

Court:
I think the Court has zeroed in on the narrowness of
this case with respect to the successorship issue.

It does

involve service industry type businesses, and our position
before this Court at this time, which has not been answered by
the court below or by counsel, is that this facility operation
of either Burns or Wackenhut was not an employing industry
under either Burns or Wackenhut, and therefore there could not
be any continuity of the employing industry.
VJe're not contesting the general law that a successorship shall be found 'where there is no change in the employing
industry.

We're dealing with a particular service industry,

and what this facility was, which everybody has assumed, this
facility operation was just a small portion of Wackenhut’s
business in California, and it was a very, very small portion
of Burns' business in California.
■Nov;, the cases, unfortunately, have not dealt with

2.1

this question of what is an employing industry in the service
industry context»
And we say that an employing industry must foe of
large enough portion to where there is managerial authority and
skill which is necessary to run the business and make
decisions on matters that are critical to employees, and that
the employing industry is used to the purpose, therefore, to
determine the employees' desires about having a union»
Kow, as regards the facts in this case, as has been
pointed out, there was an annual renewal contract between
Lockheed and

Wackenhut.

There v?as not a term agreement

between Wackenhut and Lockheed.

And that the contract

between Wackenhut and the plant guards was the first contract,
so tnafc the successors and assigns clause had not been on any
previous agreemenfc.
Nov/, why didn’t this facility have the indicia of
an employing industry?

As we have said, it was a very, very

small portion of the business of each.

There was only one

supervisor there, part-time, when Wackenhut had it; when Burns
took it over there was one supervisor with limited authority*,
limited authority. The wages, the benefits, the working
conditions, ail other decisions were established at the
corporate headquarters, not at the facility.

With respect to

Burns, it was established at the Ontario base.
There were separate office staffs —• there was no

28

office staff at the facility for Burns.

There was no payroll,

no accounting staff; all that was handled at the sub-office
for Burns, and at the California office for Waekenhut.

And

there were separate manuals and procedure’s of these two
competing companies, of which this facility was merely a very
small portion.
In any event, there was a substantial change
primarily because of the quickness within which this operation
facility was integrated into Burns' regular Operation.
Because of Burns' practice of interchanging guards regularly,
to have the flexibility, to have a particular guard working
more than one location, where his services could be best
utilized, they had this practice.

And within six months, less

than a majority of the former Waekenhut employees were employed
at the facility.

So that immediately upon Burns taking this

over, it was integrated into this other unit.
From a policy standpoint, as the Chief Justice, I
think, pointed out, there would be serious problems to this rule
of successorship applied in the service industries to the
companies like Burns, and it would cause a lack of stability
in labor relations, because —
Q

Well, Mr. Bakaly, do you contest the decision

that the union was the bargaining agent?
MR. BAKALY;

We do — upon the takeover, yes; we do

not believe that Burns was a successor to Waekenhut, and, there-

fore,, the UPGWU was not the bargaining representative.
Q

Do you have to win on that?

HR. BAKALY:

We don't have to win on that for the

contract question, no.
Q

Why not?

Why not?

If the union is the bargaining

agent, it's that because Burns was a successor.
MR. BAKALY;

That’s right.

And that would be the

only •— that would be the only basis on which we would have to
operate.
Q

Then if he was the successor, how can you say

that the ~~ that Burns isn’t bound?
MR. BAKALY; Well, because, Mr. Justice White, Section,
8{d) of the National Labor Relations Act very precisely
proscribes certain powers to the Labor Board.

The Labor

Board, the National Labor Relations Board does not have the
power to tell an employer to become a party to an agreement.
This is a cardinal principle, and —
Q

Well, I know, but •—

MR. BAKALY:

this is what the Labor Board has

done here. They have —*
Q

I know, but by becoming a successor the employer

agreed.
MR. BAKALY;

In what regard, Mr. Justice White?

There was no --- there was no law at the time that the emnloyer
Leo vase a successor that he was obligated under this agreement.

30

Q

Well, he became a successor voluntarily?

MR» BAKALY;

That’s correct.

He bid for the job and

was awarded it by Lockheed and any relationships —
Q

Well, he said, "I voluntarily want to be a

successor."
MR. BAKALY:

Right.

But the law for 35 years to that

time was that a successor was not obligated to honor the
agreement.
Q

Even though he was obligated to

MR. BAKALY:
Q

To bargain —

~~ bargain with the union?

MR. BAKALY:

Yes, sir. That has been the law for 35

years until the Board, in this case, for the first time since
1934, changed that rule.
Q

And the parties, by saying successors and assigns,

couidn51 make
MR. BAKALY:

Couldn’t obligate a third party by the

mere successors and assigns language.

Nov/, the Court, in

Wiley, in a 301 action, did hold for the purposes of arbitration
that a successor was obligated to arbitrate; but that was a far
cry from holding that the person arbitrating was bound.

It was

up to the arbitrator to decide the portions, if any, of the
collective bargaining agreement to which the successor was
obligated.
Wow,

31
Q

Well, the Second Circuit opinion that we're

reviewing here held that your client was a successor and had
to bargain, but that it was not bound by the contract» MR» BAKALY:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice,

That's

correct.
Q

And you petitioned for cert on the first part?

MR. BAKALY:

On the first part, on the successorship

part,
Q

You say you're not obligated even to bargain?

MR. BAKALY; That's correct.
facility operation was not

Because this small

was not —■ an employing industry

as that term should be applied in order to have the stability.
Think what would happen to a service company in the
Greater Los Angeles area that has a collective bargaining
agreement with one union, that it recognises that union for
Los Angeles County, and they're competing constantly fox' these
jobs.

Now, if every time they take over a new job they're going

to take over a new union, that's going to cause serious
problems of instability, it's going to cause jurisdictional
strikes,

and it's going to put the employer in the middle

between two competing unions.
Now, this is the policy reason why in this industry —
we're not talking about successorships generally; but in this
service industry, where there is so much of the interchange of
employees and the changing of jobs so regularly.

32
Q

Well, if it were clear — if it were clear in

advance that in a situation like — that in a transaction like
Burns engaged in, that you ware (a) going to have to bargain
and (b) honor collective bargaining contracts, then I don't
know what confusion there would be.
was bidding on.

Burns would know what it

It's just that there wouldn't be as much

flexibility in one element of its cost and one element of its
bid as they thought there might be,
MR, BAKALY:

Weil, they couldn't interchange employees

You can't require employees to join two or three different
unions, Mr. Justice White, 1 mean, and require them to pay dues
in these unions, as a practical matter,

So you couldn't inter­

change employees from one job to another, even though you thought
that in order to do it you'd have — and to have efficiency,
you'd want to.
Q

1 don't understand that.

MR. BAKALY:

Well, because if over here at Job A you

have Union X, and over here at Job B you have Union Y, and you
have union shop agreements with both of them .requiring union
membership within 30 days —
Q

Yes?

MR, BAKALY:

you couldn't transfer an employee

from this job over here on a. temporary basis without requiring
him to be a member of the union.
Q

Well, that's true? but that is — that might be

a ~~ that is really no difference in kind from saying that you
have to recognize and bargain with one union one place and one
at another»
MR» BAKALY: We think it is in this small, minimal
area of service industries.

That's why we’re not trying for a

principle of law here that will stop the general rule of
successorship and obligation to bargain when you acquire a
factory, when you acquire a business that’s a going concern,
with an office staff and so forth; we’re not attempting to
alter that rule of law.
Q

You mean requiring you to bargain?

MR. BAKALY:
the agreement.

Requiring you to bargain as opposed to

I’ll gat to the agreement, because that's a

matter of great concern to us.
But on the successorship issue, we are net trying for
a — maybe our position is somewhat different from the amicus
in this regard, but as far as Burns is concerned we are trying
only here to show the Court the difference between a service
industry and industries generally in this area of successorship.
We're not trying to adopt a rule of successorship different
from the present rule of successorship except in this narrow
service industry.
Now, —
Q

Doesn’t this all depend on your right to shift

these men from place to place?

34
MR. BAKALY:
C

Well, I would submit that

MR. BAKALY;
Q

Yes.

Is there any reason why ~-

I would submit that on your hypothetical from

the plant end,, maybe if you tried to shift them the union might
have a good grievance.
MR. BAKALY; Well, it depends on the collective
bargaining agreement, Mr. Justice Marshall.
Q

That's what

you just don't want the

agreement.
MR. BAKALY;

Mo.

No.

Employers today, to get

flexibility, obtain provisions in the agreement permitting
transfer of employees, in order to have this opportunity to
utilize people at different locations.
Nov/, you might, because of economics you might
bargain that away in a particular situation, but generally
speaking employers have the right in service industries to
transfer people.
Now, let's suppose —• and here's

you have to --

I’m building -Q

Tell me, how broad is this service industry in

your mind?
MR. BAKALY:

I’m thinking particularly of the

maintenance contractor and the guard service primarily.

Take

% building that has a maintenance contractor, and the particular

33
employee servicing a floor gets into a fight with the tenant.
Now, thct building contractor — the owner of the building is
going to say to the maintenance company;
out of there."

And the maintenance company is going to transfer

him to another building.
Q

Now, this happens all the time --

Well, how about ~-

HR. BAKALY:
Q

"Move that fellow

-— where they have to do it.

— the Lockheed Company, if a machinist punches

a customer in the nose, does that take Lockheed out?
MR. BAKALY;

No.

Lockheed would discharge an employee

for that.
Q

He fd have to go through the grievance machinery

to do it.
MR. BAKALY:

Go through the grievance procedure.

I

suggest that this would be less of an impact, upon employees to
permit the maintenance company to say, "We know, Joe, that
your relationship with that company was bad,

but we think that

you could have a good relationship with another company, so
we're going to give you another chance", rather than firing
the mars „
Q

Well, 1 agree that probably there is a great
t

difference with tha service industry,
MR. BAKALY: We submit that there is a difference
because of the — primarily of the interchange, the integration,
the fact that you are operating at hundreds and hundreds of

36

different locations in the general area.

If every location

becomes a bargaining unit, there's going to be great instability
and difficulty, we submit.
Q

Well, I take it, that the Board indicated to

you that — that it would be a wholly different case if you had
decided to bring in your own employees; had not hired any of
the Wackenhut employees?
MR. BAKALY:

Well, Mr. Coma did not say that exactly.

He said it would foe a factor
Q

Well, he said it would certainly foe a different

case.
MR. BAKALY;
• Q

It would foe a different case.

Yeso

MR. BAKALY:

Mr. Gregory said that he would not find

it a different case if we brought in all of our own employees.
And, in fact, where you have this policy of integration,within
six months, Mr. Justice White, there was a majority of nonWackenhut employees there.

That's a relatively short period

of time.
And because of this Burns policy that I’m talking
about that happened.

Now, just because it didn't happen on

Day One ■— I;! 11 tell you just exactly why it didn't happen on
Day One, because of the peculiar requirement for security
clearances at Lockheed.

Burns did not have in his other opera-

tiono enough employees that had top secret security clearance

3?

so needed. And that kind of circumstance is the only reason
why they did not transfer in a majority of their guards from
other locations, which is their normal practice.
Q

So they had to be — rely on some sort of

continuity with the old organisation?
MR. BAKALY:

Yes.

X!d like to go — assuming, which obviously we do not,
for the purposes of argument — go to the second point —*
Q

Good.

MR. BAKALYz

— on the contract issue, and call to

the Court's attention the long line of authority that says that
the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act was not to
allow governmental regulations of the terms and conditions of
employment.
This Court, in H, K. Porter, in 1970, held that, in
Chicago and Northwestern Transportation Union the same principle,
the statute, the legislative history, all say that the Labor
Board, distinguished perhaps from a court, does not have the
power to order somebody to make a concession or to a particular
proposal or to the entire agreement.
And that it?s this section 8(d) which controls the
Board here and prohibits what the Board has done in this case.
The language of 8(d) is "but such obligation does
not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the
making of a concession."

38
Q

In Wiley, if the arbitrator had ultimately

decided that the successor was bound, —
MR. BAKALY:
Q

No problem with that»

No problem.

Then the Act doesn't, prohibit a

successor from being bound by a prior contract that he never
agreed to?
MR. BAKALY;

Section 301, and the policy created by

this Court that it favors arbitration as the method of resolving
these disputes is not circumscribed by Section 0(d); that 301
and 3(d), which regulates the Board’s power, are separate.
Q

But, nevertheless, in Wiley, the ultimate

result might have been that the successor was bound by every­
thing in the contract, even though he never agreed to any part
of it, and even though he never agreed to arbitrate it.
MR. BAKALY; That is correct.

And that ws feel is

in the interests of following the policy of promoting
arbitration and using arbitration as the manner and the means
of resolving these disputes.

But let the arbitrator who, as

Mr,, Justice Douglas lias said, is the person that has the most
competence in this area, that has the knowledge of the law of
the shop, let him be the one to decide that.
As. of course you know, the arbitrator in the Wiley
case, after deciding that the contract was binding for a couple
of months, was then not binding thereafter.
As Mr. Justice Hays has said in an extremely well-

39

reasoned opinion, that HK, Porter and the legislative history
of the Act really control here.
We'd like to call this Court's attention to a very
recent case decided by the Sicth Circuit on the 30th of
December, in NLRB v. Interstate 65 Corporation, which doesn't
have a cite yet, No. 7.1-1198, in which the Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit agreed with the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit, finding a sueeessorship in the particular facts
of that case, but ~
Q

What's the caption of that case?

I get the slip

Q

And that's December -—

MR. BAKALY:
for the Sixth Circuit.

30th.

No. 71-1198, Court of Appeals

It's a very short statement, that they

recognized that Burns.gave his opinion before this court, they

say :

We agree with-the Second Circuit's resolution of this

issue in Burns, That court decided the Board had exceeded its
powers in ordering a successor employer to honor a

40
collective bargaining contract they had not been a party to.
The Board had never, before Barns, found such a requirement to
exist, and we see no change in case law or statutory lav; which
would permit the Board to suddenly reverse itself upon this
question.

Any further discussion of this issue is unnecessary

in light of the Supreme Court’s pending decision thereon, we
simply hold that in our view the Second Circuit’s determination
of the issue was correct, and we adhere to it.
Q

That 'case was not in the service industry?

MR. BAKALYs
Q

Pardon?

That case was not in a service industry?

MR. BAKALYs

It was a motel.

It was a motel operation,

an entire motel, was the facts of that case.

And on the

successorship they found ~~
Q

Someone had bought out or somehow acquired the

motel?
MR. BAKALYt

Yes, they reacquired a motel and made

some changesj but the court agreed with the Board in that case
on the successorship, on the facts*.,of that case, that it was a
successor but, nevertheless, held that they were not bound to
the predecessor's collective bargaining agreement.
Q

Don't hotels regard themselves as being in the

service industry?
MR. BAKALY: They may well, Mr. Justice Blackmun; I
wasn't considering them.

I’m talking about the independent

41
contractor, maintenance company, guard service that operates
in most buildings and in a lot of plants.
Now, this —
Q

But your contract point is not limited to the

service industry?
MR, BAKALY:

Oh, no.

My contract point is not

limited to the service industries at all.

We don’t believe

the Board has the power to order any employer to be bound to
any contract at all.
And I should point out, of course, as the briefs show,
the Tenth Circuit, in an opinion which,<interestingly enough,
does not cite the Second Circuit opinion or Wiley, supported
the Board and found that there was power for the Board to have
an employer honor the collective bargaining agreement.
That case is in the briefs.
But there are three circuits now, that, two have
decided against the Board’s power and one in favor of it.
The Board’s reliance on Wiley is really misplaced.
It was not implicit in Wiley that the agreement was binding on
them, as the Board has stated in its brief; it was argued by
the amicus AFL-CXO that that ought to be the rule, but the
court did not held — they held it was up to the arbitrator to
decide in each instance.
Q

Yes, but the source of the arbitration was the

contract, wasn’t it?

42
MR. BAKALY:
Q

They ~

There would not have been an arbitration except

for the collective bargaining agreement that required
arbitration?
MR. BAKALY: That's correct.
Q

At least to that extent —

MR. BAKALY:
Q

To the extent —

Wiley held the successor bound by a provision

of the collective bargaining agreement.
MR. BAKALY:

Bound to arbitrate? I'm not talking

about —
Q

I know, but there would have been no obligation

to arbitrate except for that created by the collective
bargaining agreement.

Is that right?

MR. BAKALY: That's correct.
thi

But, as the Court —

is a critical point, as the Court points out, what they

are doing there is they are favoring the policy of settling
disputes by arbitration.

They are not saying that the Labor

board, which its powers are set forth by Congress, has the power
to do this„
Now, I —
Q

Well, that just wasn't a species of compulsory

arbitration, though?
MR. BAKALY:
Q

I beg your pardon?

Wiley just wf'..3n't a species of compulsory

43
arbitration which would be wholly contrary to the Act,

As

Mr, Justice Brennan says, it was becau.se, presumably, the party
was bound to arbitrate.

He was ordered to arbitrate, and it

was because of the contract provision.
MR. EAKALY: Well, that's right,

But the point that

I'm staking, though, is that we are not here now where a court
has ordered the employer to be bound by the agreement.

We're

here under an unfair labor practice.
Q

Well, suppose this contract did provide for

arbitration?
MR. BAKALY:
Q

It does.

What then?

MR. BAKALY:

And if there was arbitration requested,

Burns would be obligated, if they are successor, would be
obligated to arbitrate.
Q

Well, that's different from this one?

MR. BAKALY:
Q

No question about that.

Yes, sir.

It is,

Why?

MR. BAKALY:

Because of the policy permitting

arbitration, and the resolving of disputes and because Congress
has not given the Board that power.
Q

Well, I thought you said you were not bound by

the contract at all?
MR, BAKALY: We're not bound by the contract — we’re
not bound to obey the Board's order that we honor this agreement.

44
Q

Wellr I misunderstood you.

MR. BAKALY:
Q

Nov/, if at this

1 thought you said you were not bound by the

contract.
No — if I said that, Mr. Justice

MR. BAKALY%
Marshall, I'm sorry.

We're not taking the position, assuming

that we're a successor, that we would not have to arbitrate.
We would have to arbitrate if that — and we would have to
arbitrate the extent to which the agreement is binding.

What

they did in Wiley.
I'd like to -~
Q

Well, what about the other provisions of the

contract, other than arbitration?
MR. BAKALY:

Does it apply to all of them?

Only if the arbitrator would so order,

Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

Wiley wasn't an NLRB case, was it?

MR. BAKALY:

Not an NLRB case, and it's clear that

the principles of 301 are not necessarily applied to unfair
labor practice cases.
Three years ago I argued before this Court in Strong
Roofing, in which Mr. Justice White wrote the opinion against
us.

We were arguing in Strong Roofing that the Labor Board did

not have the power to order an employer to pay fringe benefits.
This was a subject of arbitration.

But because of a clear,

as Mr. Justice White said, because of the clearer provisions of

45
Section 10(a) and 10(c) of the Act , giving the Board large
remedial powers, in that case the doctrine of 301 applied
to courts, did not apply to the Board because of the provisions
of Section .10 of the Act.
We say that the same thing applies here.

The rules

with respect to Section 301 do not apply because of the clear
intent of Congress in 8(d) not to permit the Labor Board —
they were very concerned —
Q

Well, I take it from your argument, at least,

The Board went way beyond Wiley, in the sense that it ordered
you to comply with every provision in the contract?
MR. 3AKALY:
Q

Right.

And that any prevision of the contract that you

refused to comply with would be an unfair labor practice?
MR. BAKALY:
Q

Yes.

And contempt.
And whereas Wiley said, You * re bound to

arbitrate but we don't know whether you're bound by any other
provision of the contract or not.
MR. BAKALY: That's correct.
And they left it to the arbitrator and his expertise
to so hold,
Nov;, the Board really is overreaching when they say
ohat the result called fer here is to promote industrial peace,
and that there is a policy of maintaining collective bargaining
agreements.

The policy, in Section 1 of the Act, is to promote

46

collective bargaining, not the imposition on unconsenting
parties of collective bargaining agreements.
And that's what they have done here, and of course
the strike argument was made in H. K.. Porter, there it was a
flagrant case of the employer bargaining in bad faith and
refusing to a dues checkoff provision, where in other plants
it had a dues checkoff provision? it just didn't want to have
one here in that plant.

And no legitimate economic reasons

whatsoever.
And it would have saved economic strife, they wouldn't
have had so much economic strife possibly if this Court had
ordered the employer to be bound to the dues checkoff provision.
But it did not.

There would be industrial peace if there was

compulsory arbitration in this country, maybe.

Although in

soma European countries, where they've had co-determination
and government intervention, they've had national strikes.
They've had anything but industrial peace.

But maybe it would.

But that's not what Congress has intended here.
Plant closures cause industrial strifes;•->

But in Darlington

this Court held that you could close a plant for union
activities, because you didn't like — you didn't want your
plant organised.

And that kind of industrial strife is great.

So, under free collective bargaining, which is what
we have at this time, strife and strikes are sometimes necessary.
Of course, the fact that you have a collective bargaining

47
agreement doesn't mean that you5re necessarily going to be
free from strikes, All of us know the situations where
employees and unions have struck in violation of collective
bargaining agreements and refused to go back in the face of
court orders,
Q

In —

MR. BAKALY:
Q

Yes, sir?

going back to the successor point, the duty

to recognise that union and bargain with it might have existed
wholly independently of whether you're a successor?
MR. BAKALY:

I don’t follow that, Mr. Justice White.

1 don't know quite how to do it --

Q

Well, —

MR. BAKALYs
Q

-”-27

— if we were a successor •—
out of 42 of the Wackenhut employees were

already represented by a union„ and if they had demanded
bargaining, without even saying you were a successor, I suppose
you'd have had some obligations to bargain.
MR. BAKALY:

Well, no.

They could have filed a

petition and there could have been an election.
Q

If they won?

MR. BAKALY:

If they had won, yes, then we would

have it.
And that’s really where we are on the suceessorship
issue;; we're not saying that there isn’t a way for these

48
employees to have the union, we're just saying that we ought
to have an election as the way rather than having the union
imposed upon the employees and —
Q

Wall, certainly you didn't challenge — were you

in any position to challenge the unit at that point?
MR* BAKALY:

Mo.

We were not*

agreed to, it was consent —

Oh, it wasn’t?

MR* BAKALY:
Q

~ a consent unit*

No, but. the Board — there hadn’t bean a

certification?
MR. BAKALY s There was a certification based upon a
consent agreement.
Q

Well, based upon a unit, then?

MR. BAKALY:

But the parties, not the Labor Board,

agreed to the unit*
Q

Nevertheless, under the rule, you couldn't

challenge that unit?
MR. BAKALY:
unit.

Yes, we think we could challenge that

Yes, sir. And we so argued below, that we could

challenge that unit,

The third case in here is not all-

encompassing, that there are unusual circumstances.

And we

49

think that in this case this change of ownership, the integration
et cetera, would he an unusual circumstance *~~
Q

Did the Board rule against you on that?

MR, BAKALYs
Q

X believe so»

I believe so.

And you haven’t challenged that ruling, have

you?
MR. BAKALY:
Q

No, sir»

But we are going on the assumption here, anyway,

that the unit was fixed, and the only question was your duty
to bargain with a union that had previously been certified?
MR. BAKALY:

Yes, sir.

We're not contending that

the appropriate unit and the employing industry are the same
thing at all. We’re saying they are two different -Q

I understand that.

MR. BAKALYs

two different concepts.

And we did

contest the unit, and we did not raise it specifically, unless
it’s raised in our question No. 1 in our cert petition in
this case.

Q

Mr. BakaXy, the Board’s holding on unfair labor

practices, this as to the contract point, was that your refusal
to honor the contract was a violation — what?
MR. BAKALY:
Q

Yes, sir.

Well, 8(a)(5) as informed by 8(d)?

MR, BAKALY:
Q

—- of 8(a)(5)?

Yes, sir.

Not specially on 8(d), but just 8(a)(5) derived

50
from 8(d); was that it?
MR» BAKALY :
Q

Both?

MR. BAKALY:
Q

I think both —

— both were allowed, yes, sir.

Well, did you. make any argument below, or do

you make any here, based on the language of 8(d)?

As 1 recall,

8(d) says, "That where there is in effect a collective-"
bargaining contract" and so forth, "the duty to bargain
collectively shall also mean that no party to such contract
shall" and so forth.
MR. BAKALY:
Q

That's — we make that point, that

That you8re not a party to the document,

MR. BAKALY;

— we're not a party to the agreement.

And that the language >~™ Congress was clear in the language of
that part
Q

Well, doesn't the Board have to rely on 8(d) to

say you're bound?
MR. BAKALY: They are relying on 8(d) —*
Q

They just can't rely on 8 «— on 8(a)(5) ■—

MR. BAKALY:
Q

3(d)?

No —

MR. BAKALY: Because 8(d) defines (a)(5).
the section that tells us what (a)(5) means.
says, refuse to bargain in good faith.

8(d) is

But (a)(5) just

That 8(d) says what

that means'; so they go together, you can't separate them.

51
Q

Well, of course the Board's brief says that

their holding relied principally on Wiley.
MR. BAKALY: That's right.
Q
8(d).

And also concluded that its decision effectuated

They don't say — at least they don't in their brief,

concede that they relied on 8(d) to, for the 8(a)(5) finding
against you.
MR. BAKALYs

I don't see how they can separate the

two.
Q

But in any event you do?

MR. 8AKALY%

In any event we rely on 8(d) as a

proscription on the Board's power in unfair labor practice
cases to require somebody to foe obligated to an agreement.
Q

You have to be a party to the contract?

HR. BAKALY:
Q

You have to be a party.

Yes.

MR. BAKALY: The Board has no power to order you to

be a party.
Q

Well, that's true, but the Board, to hold you

guilty of an unfair labor practice in that respect, had to
find that you were bound to the contract and had modified it

without bar ga1ning?
MR. BAKALY: Well, they don't have to go with the lastpart.
Q

Why?

52
MR. BAKALY;

If we are successor, than if we have

unilaterally modified the agreement —
Q

I mean, where does the Board gat their juris­

diction to enforce labor contracts'?
MR. BAKALY:
Q

Well,, that's a good question —*

Well, it’s not an unfair labor practice to

breach a — automatically to breach a contract?
MR. BAKALY:
Q

That's right.

Well, you have to go to 8(a)(5} — there is a

provision wherein it says that you cannot modify —
MR. BAKALY:
Q

Modify; that's 8(d).

8(a).

MR. BAKALY;

And that's the provision that the Board

relies on to find a violation of 8(a)(5) for a unilateral
modification.
This Court, as you point out, has never so ruled on
that point.

In Strong Roofing there is some dicta that would

indicate in that direction; but this Court has not, on all fours,
ruled on that question. And the Board, in its most recent
Collyer case, while not conceding that it doesn't have tha power,
now it says that it is going fco defer questions of modification
to arbitration.

A position that many of us have been urging

the Board for some tia«*; and this most recent Collyer ease
indicates that that's the direction tha Board is going to go
at this time

53
Now, the purposes of the Act will be effectuated by
assuming a saccessorsh.ip, by requiring good faith bargaining,
and the arbitration that Wiley permits.

We are not asking

the Court to back away at all from the Wiley case.

The

arbitrator is more qualified7 and desirable, and quicker to
interpret these matters than the Labor Board.
And we submit that the Board’s rule of imposing
collective bargaining agreements will cause serious inequities
upon the parties.

As Judge Hays pointed outs- counsel alluded

to the Dura rule — as Judge Hays pointed out, it would be very
unfair to a labor union that made a collective bargaining
agreement with a failing company, let's say, for three years

on very favorable terms to then have that company acquired
by Sears, Roebuck, or some large company that is not at all

j

failing, and be obligated to that agreement for two and a half
to three years.
So that this would be a serious inequity, as Judge
Hays pointed out, —
Q

Mr. Bakaly, would you concede that the Board

could enter an order compelling you at least to arbitrate in
this situation, or would you say that that had to be done
through a Section 301 proceeding?
MR. BAKALY: Through Section 301.
Q

As there was in Wiley?

MR. BAKALYs

Yes, sir

No question about that.

54
Q

But the Board could have abstained for the

arbitrator?
MR. BAKALY:

1 don't follow that.

[Laughter„]
Q

But even if the Board was right in saying that

it was an unfair labor practice, or might be, they could have
abstained pending arbitration?
MR. BAKALYs

Yes, they could have deferred, deferred

to arbitration; and that’s why they’ve now done in Collyer.
That’s what they’ve done.
The Board’s rale, really, also, from a policy stand­
point in our view, would really unduly restrain competition
in this area.

The Board points this out in Emerald Maintenance,

and they point out that there it’s under a Service Contract
Act, that there’s a policy permitting the government contractor
to bid.
Lockheed is 99 percent government contractor.

While

it’s true that this contract with Burns was not under the
Service Contract Act, that the same policy applies of saving
•the government money, which is really what the Air Force
argued in Emerald Maintenance, that a policy of contract
honoring would cost the government because of its inability to
have lov;er bids.
That same principle would apply here.
Also, oftentimes the alternative for a company that

55
is in the place of being acquired is to go out of business if
it can’t be acquired.

Now, we submit that this rule of contract

honoring, requiring, imposing a collective bargaining agreement
is going to be a deterrent to acquisitions? because an
employer that comes in and wants to acquire a company, even if
he’s a successor, he has no — he doesn’t mind about bargaining
with the union, but ha wants to try to get some changes.

And

that collective bargaining agreement says it may well be that
collective bargaining agreement that has paused the company
to be in the position it’s in,
Now, if this is permitted,, we're going to have a lot
more industrial strife.

Q

You might as well say that rather than say it

restrains acquisitions, it restrains competition.
MR. BAKALY:

Yes, sir? it does.

And I’ve just said

that.
Q

In the service industry?

MR. BAKALY:
industry.

In the service industry, and in any

In any industry.

It would have that effect, if the

contract is — because no one could come in and bid any — and
particularly would it be so in these industries whore the
big bulk of the price is the cost of the service,
Q

Well, if you prevail, then the employer may

bargain with a labor factor in his bid?
MR. BAKALYs

He could bargain — if he were a successor

56
he could bargain with the union and may, depending upon economic
power, may get a better economic arrangement or not,,

And this

is the system that we've been under„
Now, we submit that Burns is not a successor because
of the peculiar industry involved here f and that, in any
event, assuming that Burns is a successor, that the Board has
no power to impose a collective bargaining agreement,
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr, Come, you have about seven minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COME;
Q

Thank you,

Mr. Come, —

MR. COME:
Q

Yes, Your Honor?

just what does the Board opinion mean?

This

is on the contract.
MR. COME:
Q

I refer your to Appendix 10, —

Yes, that’s what I’m looking at.

MR, COME;

-- in which the Board says, "We find,

therefore, that Burns is bound to thefc contract as if it were a
signatory thereto, and that its failure to maintain the contract
in effect is violative of Sections 8(d) and 8(a)(5)" -—
Q

But 8(d) is not an independent unfair labor

practice, is it?

5?
MR. COMEs
Q

Ho, you have to —

It’s only

a definition of the failure to

bargain collectively, isn't it?
MR* COME:

Yes*

Which is the unfair labor practice

in 8(a)(5)*
Q

In 8(a)(5)*

MR. COME:

Yes.

Which says that it is an unfair labor

practice to fail to bargain collectively*
Q

Right*

MR. COME:

Now, 8(d) defines in large part what

constitutes a failure to •—
Q

Well, I don't suppose it's that important, but

1 gather technically the violation is 8(a)(5)?
MR. COME:
Q

Yes.

MR, COME:
arbitration.

Yes, Your Honor.

How, to be sure, Wiley only compelled

However, the considerations upon which the Court

compelled a nonconsenting employer to the contract to go to
arbitration under that contract, we submit, are precisely the
same considerations that justify the Board in applying the same
principle to its interpretation of 8(d).
The Court relied upon the fact that a collective
bargaining agreement is not, in any real sense, the simple
product of a consensual relationship; it's a code governing an
industrial community that is negotiated under the principles

58
and requirements of the National Labor Relations Act.
It binds employees who didn't even consent to the
contract, or weren't even employed at the time it was negotiated...
He may not even be a member of the union which negotiated it,
albeit a member of the bargaining unit that the union has to
represent.
More importantly, the Court relied upon the fact that
the objective of national labor policy requires that the
rightful prerogatives of owners independently to rearrange
their businesses and even eliminate themselves as employers
be balanced by some protection to employees from a sudden
change in the employment relationship, because the employee
in the union usually doesn't have a say in these transfer
negotiations.

And we submit that that is a fortiori in an

industry like the service industry, which is subject to this
rapid turnover.
Finally, the Court relied upon the fact that the
industrial strife could be avoided by submitting the employees’
claims to arbitration rather than leaving them to & test of
economic powers.
Q

Mr. Comes, —

MR. COME:
Q

Yes?

— I take it your position means that the

employer-successor is bound by the contract, and, hence, he
ecuId not bring in his own employees if he wanted to?

59

MR. COME:
Q

Well, ~

I-Ie could not fire the existing employees because

there’s no clause under the provision of the contract?
MR. COME:

As to •— if the contract is applicable,

the extent to which he has to abide by the contract, the extant
to which he can make changes to meet his situation are all
matters that he is free to bargain with the union about and,
fa-ling agreement, to take to arbitration.
The Board’s decision hare, far from being in derogatio
of arbitration, permits arbitration to work. All the Board is
saying here is that if you are a successor under the National
Labor Relations Act, as we have defined it, you have taken
over —
Q

Well —

MR. COME:

— willingly this employing enterprise,

you just can't say that you're not going to pay any attention
to the —•
Q
does mean that.

Then your answer to my question is yes.

He’s not free to bring in his own employees

without following the contract provisions with respect to
discharge?
MR. COME:

That is correct.

He may be free at the

decision as to whether, before he takes over the business, as
to —
Q

So the other 15 employees of Wackenbut that he

60
didn't employ, if they had wanted to be employed and were
refused, had grievances under the Board provision?
MR. COME: They might have, although they were not
subject to that contract originally? but —
Q

Well, why weren't they?

MR.COMEs

Well, at the timeithat he took over, X mean

before —
Q

They were part of the Wackenhut work force, as

I understand.
MR. COME: Well ~ well, they —
Q

They were part of the union.

MR. COM2: There were 26 — there were 42 members of
the Wackenhut work force when Wackenhut shut down.

Burns

employed, 1 believe it was, 27 of those members of the work

Q

What about the other 15, if they had wanted to

fee employed and were ora fused?
MR. COM2: Conceivably they would have had a grievance
under the --Q

Conceivably?

MR. COME;

1 think that they would have, but at

that point, however, — tha reason I'm hedging is that they
ware discharged by Wackenhut, and their contracts of employment
were not renewed by Burns.
Well, that's what creates a grievance, isn't, it?

61
MR. COFIB; But, in any event, this is a problem for
the arbitrator.
Q

Tell me, Mr. Come, —

MR. COME;
Q

Yes.

— doss — do the decisions in Emerald

Maintenance and Collysr, which I gather is about a year later
than the decision here by the Board, do they represent some
retreat from the principles of this case?
MR. COME:

No, Your Honor.

In formulating the

principle in this case, the Board -Q

Well, the fact is that in neither case was the

employer held bound to the -MR. COME:

Well, the Board found successorship in

Emerald Maintenance, —
Q

But —

MR. COME:

— it did not bind them to the contract

because in Burns, as Mr. Justice Stewart indicated earlier,
the Board had a caveat in there for unusual circumstances.
Q

Certainly.

MR. COME; And the Board found that the peculiarities
of government procurement practice, coupled with wage
determinations under the Service Contract Act, created a
situation where, at least with respect to certain types of
government contracts, there wasn't the flexibility for negotia­
tion that was present in the typical civilian type of contract

62

which is what we have here*
We do not have here Lockheed’s government contract
involved in this case»
Now, if I may be permitted to just make one other
point o
Wiley also, we submit, disposes of the contention
that what the Board is doing here is writing a contract for
the parties, because the Court in Wiley specifically pointed
out that this case, where they had found the kind of continuity
that you had in Wiley, and the continuity here is much stronger
than you had in Wiley, the Court said:

this case cannot

readily be assimilated to the category of those in which there
was no contract whatever, or none which is reasonably related
to the party sought to be obligated.
There was a contract with Interscience, Wiley’s
predecessor was party to it.

We submit that is precisely the

situation here, a fortiori, in view of the substantial
identity with the original work force.
Q

Mr. Come, I have one question.

MR.' COM2:
Q

Yes, sir?

I guess you can deal with it with a very short

answer.
Bo I get your position correctly, the Board’s
position now, that someone taking over a large operation with
either its maintenance force or its security force, having a

63
large number of employees, and instead of the bidding process
such as we had here, Burns underbidding Wackershut and the
others, the basic factory or operator is terminating their
contract with the guard service company because they are
unreliable, untrustworthy, inefficient, that there’s pilfering
going on,all sorts of things that happen in these types of
service organisations®
Kow, is it your position that the "successor'5 who
takes over that function, either of maintaining the building
or protecting it, has got to take lock, stock, and barrel
all the employees in those circumstances?
MR. COME %
Q

Is it pretty close to that?

MR. COME:
Q

No.

Wo, I don't think so.

Then what did you have in mind when you suggeste3

in response to Mr. Justice White that perhaps the other 15 that
they didn’t taka might have a grievance for not being

taken

over by Burns?
MR. COME:
will prevail.

But the grievance doesn’t’ mean that they

I mean, if there were —

Q

Well, I assume you meant a colorable claim.

Q

Well, it means they’re still employees, though,

Mr. Come, until they're fired in accordance with the contract?
That must be what you meant.
MR. COME;

I think that this is a question that the

64

arbitrator would have to determine, as to whether or not —
Q

Well, they are employees until they’re discharged

in accordance with the contract, aren’t they?
MR. COME:

But clearly whether it would not be cause

under the contract for -Q

I agree.

MR. COME:
closing down

I agree.

— for Wackenhut to say that, "Since I am

my operation, I am terminating you as of five

o9 clock tomorrow."
Q

Whose employees are they?

Isn’t, that the

question?
They’re the employees of the first, the one in the
posture of Wackenhut hax*e.

But I took your position before,

as expressed, to say that for all practical nurnoses they’re
employees of whoever takes over that function, whether it’s on
winning them by a low bid or whether cancellation or termina­
tion of a prior contract.
MR. COME:

Well, they certainly were here, because

Burns voluntarily took over a majority of the Wackenhut
employees for reasons that were of advantage to its own
operation, these —
Q

But your friend, when he argued, said that even

if they hadn't taken over any, even if they hadn't taken over
a single employee, the legal situation would be the same.
MR. COME: We do not go that far.

We don’t think that

65
you have to go that far in —
Do you think it has to he a majority?

Q

MR. COME:

1 wouldn't say that it has to be a major it.'

I thinkit. has to be a substantial number.

It has to

be

enough to give you a continuity of employment conditions in
the bargaining unit.
Q

Well, Mr. Coma, I suggest that your position

means that they have to take over all of them.
in with just part.
andunless they are
MR. COME;
Your Honor.

They can't come

They have to take over all of them until
discharged in accordance with the contract.
Well, I'm not prepared to go that far.

I think that there may be a difference for

purposes of compelling arbitration under 301f and what would
be tiie rule for purposes of establishing a bargaining
obligation or representation status under the National Labor
Relations Act.
The Court in Wiley was very careful to indicate that
it was not passing on the question as to whether you had enough
there to impose representation status on the union.
