ORAL TEGUMENT OF REAL P. RUTLEDGE , ESQ. ,
OR BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MIR RUTLEDGE t.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it, please

the Court :
This a&Bo is on review of a decision of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which affirmed
a denied, of a writ of habeas corpus which was challenging a
conviction <- first-degree murder in the State Courts of
Florida.
The first-degree murder conviction occurred in 1958,
and became finalr that is, in the sense that the appeal
procedures were completed find the time expired for petition
for certiorari in this Court in 1960, after — I mention that
fact because this is after., of course, the decision of this
Court in Soano vs. Hew York, a 1959 decision which occurred
after -the conviction in the trial court and before that
conviction became final.
The facts involving the alleged crime itself are

his common “"lew wife, who was at that time pregnant*

On the evening of May 31, after he got off work, he
purchased

cheap used car for approximately $100, and then

that, evening he took his wife out for a joy ride, which ran
through t'o

Apparently there was some drinking durin

In the early morning hours of June .1, that is about

During this session on June 1.1th, he was questioned
active Holmes and Detective
felcCiure, and they resorted to the rather customary technique
of tanclrm cuasiianiyg, that ia on a man would question while
the other one was in a secret room adjoining, from which he
could

:rough a one-way mirror what wan going on, and

of course, unbeknownst to him, the room, was wired sc that
whatever ha said in there would be recorded,

And the man

in the secret room, behind the one-way mirror, could turn on
the recording device and record what was said,
the detective testified that he had only one horn*
cf tape, and sc, out of the entire time from 5:00 p.o, to 1:00
ethat hr was out of his cell, only one hour was put on

and the tape begins at a point where the petitioner
was saying that he wanted to confess, and that he proposed a
little charade, where he would go out of the room and then
knock on the door and come in and say, "I’m appearing here
voluntarily to confess,"

And it was stated that he had asked

that this little charade be gone through in order to demonstrate
that he was doing this voluntarily and freely.
He says that he had been coerced into doing this,
and that -once he decided he had to confess, why, he wanted to

on the 12tht they took him down to the scene of the incident
arid took photographs of him.

That was, in a sesse, the third

confession; the first one was on tape; the s econd one was a
transcribed, secratary-typed-up confession which he signed?
fcfea third was this incident on the 12th when he was taken to
the scene.
And then, again on the afternoon of the 12th, he
asked to change his statement, and

fourth confession was type

up, which he signed.
Only after that was an attempt made to arrest him
for any specific crime.

After these confessions were extracted

the detective went down to the magistrate and swore out a
warrant for his arrest for first-degree murder.
This resulted in his being transferred from the City
Jail to tha County Jail, and in the County Jail he was allowed
finally to make*-a telephone call.
a lawyer immediately.

He called out and obtained

Even though he had been arrested and

changed to the County Jail, he still was not brought before
any committing magistrate.

And the attorney that he was able

to contact by making a telephone call on the 19th of June
filed a h&L-aas corpus petition, which resulted in a preliminary
hearing? and at that time he was brought finally before a
saagiot.vat'e and was committed over to the grand jury.
lavi the grand jury indicted him for first-degree

murder on July 1, 1958.

'&v. was not able to post bail, and so he was held in
tl'.a County Jail pending his trial , which occurred in December
of 19555,
In July^ on July 18the the State, for some reason,
unexplained , feeling that it needed more information from him,
knowing that he was represented by counsel, knowing that ha
had been indicted, decided that the way to obtain this
information was not in a straightforward way by either
approaching counsel or even by calling him in and seeing if
he would voluntarily answer questions? instead they resorted
to the technique of taking a Negro police officer and dressing
him in civilian clothes and having him pose as a fellow
prisoner and one who

hnfi this polios officer, whose name it

Archie Langford, entered petitioner’s cell oft July 13th, at ..
•about

4*00 or 5*00 p.su, and then stayed in that cell

continuously

with him, except for one brief moment when he

was taken out, shortly after he entered the cell, on that
Friday, July

18th, evening.

Other

than that short time of less than five minutes

when no :•-3- taken from the call, Officer Langford was in the

The testimony of Officer Langford is clear that he

He went into the cell with

instructions to get information from the petitioner, and he
tried to gat petitioner to talk about his case»
Petitioner refused.

Petitioner told him that he had

1 ten instructed by his lawyer hot to talk about his case, and
na repeatedly , over and over and over again, said, *2 don * t
want to talk about the case•*
He didn't talk about the case that Friday, even
though that Friday evening he was waked up out of his sleep by

the officer, and still refused to.
The following morning he refused to talk about his
ease.

It wasn’t until approximately noon the following day

that the officer, by use of rather clever and adroit psycholo­
gical techniques, was able to get the petitioner to start
talking in little bits and phrases about the case, and then
if really wasn't until, in the wee, small hours of Sunday
mwrni.ug, that, as Officer Langford describes it himself, the
titione.r broke down under this continuous pressure, and
told, as Officer Langford states it, the full story about
why be went into the river, saying that ha had gone into the
:*d

, in order to collect the insurance, to kill his wife and

collect the insurance.
i

Mr. Rutledge, at this time, as I think I under-

11

«.toed you to have told ns, the authorities already had one or
more confessions, didn’t they?

MR. RUTLEDGE?
Q

They did, Your Honor.

Is there any

~ but what this confession did

was to supply motive, is that it?
MFu RUTLEDGE?

implied

By that method?

It certainly amplified motive, and it

this confession, this last .confession was the one

used and relied upon most heavily by the State in the trial,
The first one introduced*

And it was referred to repeatedly

in the final argument*
One purpose, obviously, that they used this last
confession was because the State was going for the death
penalty.

And in the course of this confession to Officer

Langford, the petitioner had commented to Langford, who
supposedly was being held for being involved in a murder with
a white man — actually a Chinese man, was his fake story.
Q

Right.

MR. RUTLEDGE;

Petitioner had said., "I'm being held

for allegedly killing a black man, and they don't care whether
' kill a black man*”
argument, was %

And this was the theme of the final

We want to prove

that it's as serious to kil.

a black man in this State as it is to kill a white man.
And, therefore, that was tha premise on which the
State vim as king for t he death penalty.
Q

But was there — except for that flavor, was

there anything additional revealed in this prison confession

to .the other officer that hadn’t been already confessed to?
MR, RUTLEDGE: There ware details, colaration in
detail, there was a much more graphic description than the
formal language that had been written out,
'Mem, X haven’t heard, frankly, the tape that was
recorded, so .1 don’t know how 1 could compare what was on fch;
tape with what Officer Langford said the petitioner had said

Q

And, finally, is there any indication in the

record or from anything at the trial as to why, after they
had two or three confessions, they felt the need to get an
additional one?
MR. RUTLEDGE:

X can speculate on that, but X can’t

say that there‘s anything in the record, Your Honor, that —Q

Well, what was the inference?

MR. RUTLEDGEs The inference is that the Stats was
worried that the confessions that it had extracted on the 11th
and the 12th would be held inadmissible because of the
description of the events that I’ve just described, that they
were afraid that they would be deemed to be coerced confes-

Q

Because of the circumstances that were —

MR. RUTLEDGE: Because of the circumstances, because
he had been held incommunicado, because he had. been cut off
from getting a lawyer during this period of time.

13
Q
Q

Yea.

1 suppose that speculation is somewhat diluted

by the fact that running afoul of not only the Massiah case but
Escobedo by these processes after the man had a lawyer.
MR. RUTLEDGE:

honor's question.

I'm not sure that I follow Your

Of course neither Messiah nor Escobedo had

been rendered at this time.
Q

No.

This is all pre.

MR. RUTLEDGE: All pre.
0

They're running afoul of standards of those

cases.
MS. RUTLEDGE:
Q

That's correct.

Which — I don't know that it's important, but

which do you regard as the more offensive, the extraction after
he uas a lawyer or the extraction before?
MR. RUTLEDGE: Well, Your Honor, no court, and it's
significant that no court has ever looked at the totality of
the situation involving this petitioner.
His appeal was taken
0
but he escaped pending his appeal, and that appeal was dismissed
without opinion and without review of the record.

Ha then

applied for certiorari to Florida Supreme Court, and that, was
denied without opinion.
He they filed a series of collateral attacks, but
-

of these presented the total situation before the court ?

and

:he total situation here is that the Sixth Amencfatenl

14
violationf that if the violation of the right to counsel, began
from the very day he was taken into custody on June 1, and
continued right through this July interrogation, this Officer
Langford interrogation. And that seems to me to be the most
. the fact that stands out in this case is that here is a man
who was blocked from having any legal aid and he needed it
desperately, until after these confessions of the 11th and 12th
were extracted.
Q

Are you really arguing that independent of

standards of Massiah and Escobedo, without getting into the
question of retroactivity of Massiah, that this case is one that
can’t stand?
MS. RUTLEDGE: Absolutely, Your Honor,

We certainly

contend, even if you were to take the extreme position, which
1 submit would be an extreme position, that the legality of
iis custody could be judged only by decision rendered by this
Court at the time that his conviction became final? that even
under those standards, his conviction cannot stand,
Q

Mr. Rutledge, was this argument made through

the Florida courts, this totality of circumstances argument
that you“re now making?
MR. RUTLEDGE;

Your Honor, he was ~~ he filed this

petition for habeas corpus

in. the Federal District Court in

Miami, and counsel was appointed for him, and the court
non sol dared both- and ruled both on the voluntariness of this

15
confession and also on the question of whether Messiah was
retroactive or not.
3u.t counsel, that is his appointed counsel, argued
primarily the retroactivity question,
Q

This was in the Federal District Court,

MR, RUTLEDGE: This was in the Federal District Court.
Q

How about the Florida State courts?

HR. RUTLEDGE;

1 can't answer that question. Your

Honor, because it doesn't appear.

The only opinion that

discusses the merits of this case is a habeas corpus case in the
Florida Supreme Court, State v, Cochran; all the others are
per curiam without opinion? so —
Q

Did he ever go for collateral relief in the

Florida courts?
MR. RUTLEDGE:

Yes, he did, Your Honor.

He appealed,

that appeal was dismissed? he applied for certiorari, that was
denied.

He then filed a series of habeas corpus and Rule 1,

which is a —
Q

Did he present the — as Mr. Justice Rehnquist

inquired, present the totality issue in those proceedings?
MR. RUTLEDGE:

In those proceedings, Your Honor,

so fa?, as 1 can tell from the record, he would attack one of
■•..hoconfessions but not the entire, the total picture.

T.n other words, as far as I can tell, his State, v.
loohrc-.n, ht attacked the voluntariness of the first four

16

confessions, these ones on June. 11th and June 12th.

In the

later collate r'al attacks in the Florida courts , as far as I

can tell, he attacked the admissibility of this July confession
as being involuntary; although I can't say categorically that
that's so, because the opinions don’t shed any light.
There is no doubt that the petition that he filed in.
the federal court below in this case squarely attacked this
July 12th confession.

And that the principal argument of

counsel was that it was inadmissible because of Mass!ah and
that Messiah should be the normal application.
Nov/,
Q

Mr. Rutledge, before you leave that point, are

you contesting here today the validity of the first four
confessions as well as the fifth?
MR. RUTLEDGE:

Your Honor, I stated in my brief that

I couldn’t say candidly that the petition in the lower court
presented.- as x matter of pleading or as a matter of argument,
the validity of these first four confessions.

However, the

evidence that was before the judge, which was the State trial
transcript, did contain all of this information, and we do
;.c. a.a .. that it is relevant in the totality of the circumstances
fchec you can51 simply sever this case into independent blocks,
and that the confession that was extracted in July by the use
Officer Langford was merely a continuation of a whole scheme
...privinv this man of his right to counsel.

But even if you look and address yourself only to
this confession that was extracted in July, we say, first of
that c.; j.>a.cly there is no way to distinguish what the St at
lid

in that case from what was held in Massiah to be

impe rm xssible.
Here is a man who was indicted on the most serious
charge, of all, involving a capital offense, and he had a lawyer
and by subterfuge and trickery the State seeks to go around the
lawyer and extract a confession, from the accused in a way
which, obviously, it could not have clone if he had been —
if he had had the benefit of counsel present, if there had
been notice.

New, the real question is whether that case, the
.fasslab case,should be given the normal usual application,
or whether it should be limited by what we say is a comoaratively now doctrina, the doctrine of nonretroactivity.
ico, this doctrine is new in the sense that up until
the Linblgtter case in 1965 no decision of this Court overruling
a prior decision, based on the Constitution, interpreting the
Constitution, had ever been limited to prospective effect
only or given less than the total effect that normal decisions
have

New, the doctrine of

dool

the LinkIutter doctrine, the

of nonretroactivity.of course has roots going back to

the Sunburst. Crv-..-.- of Mr. Justice Cardoso, which held that a

18
State court, a Montana court, could give only prospective
. il'e.’t to

. Maeinicn in a civil case without violating the due

process clauso»

And certainly it is now settled by this Court

that there is no constitutional impediment to giving a new
decision of this Court, a new decision, only prospective effect
or limited prospective effect.
And we don't propose to challenge that contention,
but we do say that one, the doctrine of nonretroactivity is a
new one; secondly, that there are obvious disadvantages to it
as well as advantages.

And these have been discussed at

length by the late Mr. Justice Black, the late Mr. Justice
Harlan, and Mr. Justice Douglas, who have dissented consistently
from the application of this doctrine.
Now, what are these disadvantages?

One is obvious,

and that is that, it produces an apparent inequality right
away*

In other words, as Professor Currier, in his, article in

'51 Virginia Law Review, cited in the Williams case, poses the
prospect of two men involved in the same crime in the same
cell, and one of them, simply by the chance that his case
was tried earlier, gets the benefit of a new constitutional
ruling and goes out, whereas the other man, at the same time
that the first man is freed on habeas corpus, the other man is
led down to the gas chamber.
Arid this inequality, this service inequality,
wtainly fa something that causes people to pause.

19
'

is also the fact that if the logic of the non-

■■ctiaity ;'o.f fa wa:.
iere

followed completely , that we would

y opini

iter diet* .

But th••» most important reason for not applying it,
>:e submit, is that the doctrine itself has the. potential of
doing serious damage to the image of this Court, in that the
power of this Court., from.Marbury vs. Madison, has been, the
respect of the people for this Court as the final expounder
of a constitution, as e court- that does not make law *

And when

the Court acts like a legislature and limits its opinions
only to prospective effects, the Court then is subject to the
charge, well-founded or not, of legislating like a legislature
rather than interpreting ana applying the constitution as a
court.
knd so we submit, for this reason, the doctrine

shcu.i.c not be applied unless there is a sudden new change in
the law; and Mass!ah, we say, was not a sudden new change.
Mar si ah, arAlabama.

the opinion itself states, stemmed from Powell v.
Xt was expressly anticipated by Spang vs, Mew York.,

And the Spjano case, as I pointed out at the very beginning,
came down before the conviction in this case was final.
3

Of course the district judge in this case quite

misstated the doctrine of Messiah, didn't he?

.-€1. RUTLkDGEs
3

I think he did, Your Honor.

I was just reading his opinion, he says that it

20

held"that confessions are involuntary, per se, if induced by
officers or their agents from an accused after his indictment
while ha is without assistance of counsel„"
And then he says the Powell case was quite different,
that the Powell case involved the Sixth Amendment.
Well, the fact is that Hass1ah involved the Sixth
Amendment.
ME. RUTLEDGE; Exactly, Your Honor,,
it did not hold that confessions were involuntary,

q

per se, did it?

It held that interrogation after indictment

deliberately undertaken by the government was a denial of his
Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
MR. RUTLEDGE;
q

Yes, Your Honor.

And then of course the Court of Appeals affirmed

this case based on the District Court's opinion.
MR. RUTLEDGE:
Q

That's incorporated —

*— by reference.

That could have been what led

the court into thinking it was new law.
MR. RUTLEDGE;

I think there was a confusion between

the Fifth and the Sixth Amendment.
Q

Right«

MR, RUTLEDGE: And We say, of course, that this was,
ov"u-i if you uuTudne this confession only by Fifth Amendment
standards. that it was not a voluntary -**.
Q

Well, that's your second point.

21
RUTLEDGE; That’s the second point , and I
certainly will leave that to my brief»
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Rutledge.

Thank you.
Mr. Olian.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP J. ROBERT OLIAN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. OLIAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
At the outset, for the sake of clarification, I
think that we ought to talk about the confessions, plural,
that were involved.

In fact, I think if you — and the best

way to look at these confessions is, one, the major confession
that*s being talked about in the petition for certiorari,
which was the confession which was elicited by Officer Langford
in the call of the petitioner.
Secondly, there is one other confession which also
was discussed by the courts at the State level, which is
referred to in the petitioner’s brief as four or five confes­
sions; in fact, what it is is one confession.

It was taped,,

it was transcribed, it was changed, it was initialed; but
essentrally we have two, and the second one 1811 refer to is
■that confession which was made to Officers Holmes and McClure.
Hew, there is in fact in the record, and 1 think

22
' Ii i;inet .it in our brief , one statement which might in fact
be con :

os a third, confession» and that statement has never

been challenged at any levelr and that is from the record on
page 148, whan Officer MeGraw arrived at the scene of the
crixrw.- he was asked:

"When you saw this defendant lying on the

pavement describe, if you will, what he was doing, what he
was saying, if anything.®’
lie replied:

"Well, he kept insisting that he drove

his car into the river."
Now, in. terms of our argument, this is quite
important.

So, again, there’s the Langford, Holmes and McClure,

and this other confession to Officer McGraw.

And I think that

these distinctions have to be kept in mind.
Q

Well, is there any question that he drove the

car in the river?
MB, GLX&N:

Mr. Justice, there’s no question except

the meaning of what he said.,

That’s what I am saying, that

the.ro is some — you could call that a third confession.
Whether he drove it in or not, the State’s contention —

Q

Well, a confession that he drove the car in the

river has nothing to do with murder, does it?
MR, OLIMJ:

Mr. Justice, the State’s contention at

the trial was he did not drive the car in the river, he jumped
out of the car before it vent into the river; so 7 think —

Q

Well, how does this confession help you on that

23
point?
MR. OLX&Ni Welly in this case he is saying, in
effect, that ha did drive it into the river, Whereas, at the
trial

,

I think it goes more to the question of credibility,

At the trial, what he said was he blanked out, he doesn’t
remember what happened, as far a» his story of what happened*
Here he says, ':5Yes, X did drive it into the. river."
Again, 1 think this is equivocal, 1 think it raises
;>am@ question about credibility of his own story of what took
place.

And 1 think that’s important in terns of the facts that

were presented at this trial, because there are constant
discrepancies.. In terms of the stories that were told? and I
think there are constant considerations hers of credibility.
X would like to talk about.those considerations
somewhat further,
hgcdn, that is equivocal as a confession, but it does
da tagree with the story that ha told that he blanked out, that
i io dossh* t rc&':omber what happened.

So, how this is interpreted

is not totally clear.
Hew, as far as the facts in this case go, there- are
number of things.

It was stated by the petitioner he was

crueefioned almost daily*

A couple of these questioning

periods had to do with cases which were in other jurisdictions,
hhry aokou

,

‘'Mould you hold him for investigation”, they came

lew», they did interrogate him.

U'hlongest questioning period was one where —» it
was wither Folk County, Floridaor Mississippi, 1 forget which
one of the too — they carae down and questioned him for six
hours about another alleged crime»
Few, they asked him at the State hearing, and this is
quite important, and it’s in our brief, they said to hiras
You weren’t questioned between the 4th and 11th."
low, you notice they’re saying "constant questioning”
"long questioning”, " a great deal cf psychological coercion
and pressure”, and this kind sf thing.
The petitioner was asked:

"You weren't questioned

between the 4th and the 11th?"
He answered:
"The Court:
you?

‘’I could have been.”
Mot could have been.

You were there, you know about it.

Were you or weren*

Yon are the only one

that can tell us."
And it's in — the petitioner:

"From, the fourth day

to the eleventh, X believe that I was questioned.
was trying to think.

I mean, X

X believe that I was questioned some

time, during the time from. the. 4 th to the 11th of .June", and
on it goes.

He can identify three periods. Your Honor; the

longest period being roughly one and a half hours during this
time that he was held for questioning.

So this matter of "constant questioning" in terms' of
all the confessions, now this goes to the Holmes-McClure

confession, -which is not the one which is the primary basis
for the petition here»
He says petitioner claims, well, he asked to write
to his wife’s family.
has another wife.

This has to be clarified*

He apparently

Minnie is not his real wife, as far as we

i

can tell.

?md he said, "No, 1 couldn’t.

I couldn’t.

X wasn't

even allowed to write to her.”
I think if you look at the Appendix you will find
three pages later, where he says, “Yes, I did v?rite to her.”
He said, ”1 wasn't even given stationery"? three pages later
he said, “Yes, 1 did write to her.”
Now, another point as far as facts goes, the petition r
points out that this is a common type of policy.

1 think it's

also worth pointing out that in the record John Tyler took
the stand, he said, ”1 was asked, by the petitioner where I coul
get, in his own words, a good insurance,"
X think it's also very important to note that the
petitioner was unable to sustain himself very effectively,
In fact, one witness took the stand and told of how he hocked
a suit for two dollars because, he was short of cash, yet he
managed to reap up the payments on these insurance policies.
Mov/, with that in mind, l5d like to get to the issues
in fcsrias of the structure of our brief.
first of all, as we pointed out in our brief, in
... .

to the Langford confession, if there is any error at all

26
and I’d like to get to this in more detail in

which we deny
a moment

but if there is any error at all, it is clearly a

harmless error *
First, we still have the Holmes-McClure confession.
Q

Of course,, that’s a matter that the Court of

appeals never reached in this record?
MR. OLXAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That was

naver brought up to that court, and I think that, as we pointed
ant in our brief, that cases by this Court have said, if you
don’t raise it in your petition that it perhaps should not be
considered by this Court.
But —
Q

Ko, no.

MR. OLXAN:
Q

You’re not the petitioner.
No, I’m —

You cars do whatever you want to support the

judgment.
MR. OLXANj

Right.

No, I’m talking about from the

petitioner’s side.
Q

Well, he’s not going to bring up the point that

it’s harmless error, is he?
HR, OLXANt
Your aonorr.
Q

No, I wasn't referring to that point.

He wasn’t bringing up these other confessions.
No.

Well, I’m talking about what you're just

beginning to address yourself to, the proposition that this
v;:„ ■ lam loss errorp the admission of this confession, even if

27
error, was lavaless„

Isn’t that what you’re going to say?

\

MB;, OLIfkK 5

Yes o

Yes .

That's the question, that’s an issue that the

q

Court of .Appeals and the District Court did not reach? isnst
that correct?
MR. OLIAM:

Yes.

hi: fur as the evidence,, though, is involved, we have

the ccafo.-j3ion, we have the evidence.

gc

As far as the evidence

in this Ccs.se, there was overwhelming proof of guilt.
Just to go through some of these facts very quickly,

because they are not all in the Appendix»
record.

It's a very long

But we did cite those facts in our brief.
First of all, the car was purchased nine hours before

this accident took place.

I told you about the insurance.

Much of this insurance would only pay in case of accident;
would not pay in case of natural death.
There is a lot of testimony about his relationship
toward the deceased., Minnie Clayton, that he doesn't
particularly care for her? that he has written to others,
telling them how he was going to corae into a great deal of
money, which would further his boxing career.

If you look -at the* record, on page 150 to 152, it
tells ua soms important things about the scene or the
It itfas; well lit.

There was good weather.

At most

there v;as ora space, with estimates ranging from 15 to 25 feet

28

opening, the rest was a solid line of boats.

So that if

someone lost control of a car, the odds on getting in that
particular 1.5 to 25-foot opening certainly weren't very great.
;k!

Your Honors, this is particularly important in

this trials the back'.windows in this car were closed.
deceased was sitting on the back seat,,

The

The back doors could

not ha opened, they were latched closed.
Mow, the previous owner of the car was asked about
the car, and what he testified to was this!

those ornaments

had never kept the back doors closed, that the doors rree^y
opened.

At the time of the accident, the police officers

pointed out that when they removed the car from the Mi«mi
River they had to use tools to get those doors opened.
At the trial they pointed out that there was no
evidence of any scratches or anything else on these chrome
ornaments, which indicated that they were force-closed, by the
collision, by going into the water at that time.
q

Well, I take it, what you’re arguing in effect

is that this convicti.on might have been obtained without the
use of the confessions?
MR. OLIAN:
q

In other words, —

MR. OLIANs
q

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

— it's a harmless error in that sense.

MR* OLIAN;

Yes, Your Honor.

29

X think that::s also true whan you couple it with the
oonfesaion to Holmes and McClure,, which was

at no point in

the Federal Courts raised again, on that particular regard»
Kow, I think that confession is particularly iraportan
and 1 think two things ought to be noticed, not. only about that
confessions, which I think adds to the harmless error argument,
but the confession to Langford.
2 think when you examine this trial fcransc: ipt you
find a tremendous concern of the trial judge for a fair trial,
a meticulous examination of all the parties involved«

He

used that procedure which was prescribed by this Court in
•Jackson v. Dauno»
detail.

They went into all the details in great

And it was not.

until then that it was turned over to the jury.

Q
were out in?

Zn your view, how many of these confessions
Was all of the material relating to his

admissions and confessions put in?
MR. 0LXA3J;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Both —

You began with the last. one.

MR. QLZAMs

Yes.

Your Honor, the Holmes-McClure was

put in and put in in detail, and the Langford testimony was
put in and put in in detail.

The petitioner suggested that,

the Langford was the most important.

I think if you examine

the transcript, examine the length of the trial, you'll
•' ever tiled, ••cr

clearly both of these confessions were put

30
i'rtc evidence with great fores.

So the Holmes-McClure

confession is just as important.
Your Honors, 1 think that if you also examine the
relation fcc the Ho lines-McClure .confession and the other con­
fession, the instructions of the judge to the jury, you will,
find again evidence of his very meticulous concern, that he
cautioned them that as to the reconsidering whether or not the
confessions were voluntary, and told them they could disregard
them entirely if they so desired.
I think that what also is important is some of the
evidence of other —
q

Did he instruct them particularly as to the

policemen5 s testimony?
MR. OLXAN:
q

Specifically —

Or was it just general as to all of them?

ME. OLIMJ;

Well, Your Honor, 1 think ha — he

didn’t separate the two confessions as he talked about
confessions ana their voluntariness.
Q

Wall, X mean, in the eyes of a layman wouldn’t

he think flat his talk with the policemen was voluntary?
MB,, OL1.1Ht.
he would think so.

I don’t think that a layman

Q

Well, why did the State get the last one?

what was the reason for it?
MR. OMAN:
Q

Mr» Justice, I have —

Well, let’s make this in two parts:

one# why

And then, why did yon. use it?

did you get it?

MR,, OMAN:

Mr. Justice, I have no idea.

This trial

took place in 1953, and I think the total atmosphere at that
ti.Ms was quite different.

What they did, I think, what their

motives were, are impossible to decide at this time.

I think,

as a matter of law, however, I do feel that these factors were
effectively handled at trial.
And that's the point that I’m trying to introduce.
Q

Mr, Glian, did you call our attention to any

cases hare in this Court where admitting an inadmissible
confession has been held to be a harmless error?
MR. GLIAN:

Your Honor, I cited Harrington and Chapma

.nd 1 think that they talk about tlie proposition here that is —
Q

Well, do you think either one of them held that

an involuntary confession could foe admitted and be held to be
harmless error?
MR. OLIA'ls
it's involuntary.
0

Your Honor, first of all, I’m not saying

I don't think it is.

Well, I. know, but your proposition is that even

M: i/.'ore, if these confessions were inadmissible, it was

htzml'ssz error - to admit them?

32
MR* QLIAUs
Q

Your Honor, 1 would make a distinction —-

I ffissne you wouldn't have to be arguing harmless

error if they were-voluntary.
MR, QLIANs Well, I would make a distinction, it seems
to ms, in terms of the case law, between a coerced confession
and a confessior which violates Messiah■>
Q

I see.

MR. OLXAN;

And I think it has to be one or the

other*
Q

I see.

Now, would you say — let's assume the

confession was involuntary -—
MR, 01,IAN:
Q

In the sense of coercion?

and it was — yes, and it was —

MR, OLIAN: Then 1 would not he arguing harmless error
in that'context.
Q

I see.

But if it's just a confession that's

taken with.out the presence of counsel —
MR. OLIANs

Yes, I think harmless error applies in

that context *
Q

you would say that —

Q

Helle do you know any —
Even though Massiah might be held to apply

re fero a c ti v e 1 y ?
HR* GLXMJj
haven't gotten to.

’Nell, that's another issue, which I

33
U

Yes, but you wouldn't have to argue harmless

error unless fcbissiah were retroactive?
Q

There’s no error.

HR. 0L2ANs That's correct, Your Honors.
0

Sc if Mass1ah is retroactive, you nevertheless

would say that the confession taken in violation of Messiah
could be admitted if it were —
MR. OLIhN:
Q

Yes.

Yes.

— if admitted, could be held to be harmless

error?
MR. QLIiUtf:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice? that's right.

Well now, do you have any precedents for that

proposition?
MR. OLIAN:
Q

Well —

Or for the proposition that the admission of —

the -wrongful admission, the erroneous admission of any extrajudicial confession can ever be harmless error?
IS. OLI£M;

Your Honor, I said that in our brief

we cited Harrington, and Chapman —
Q

Well, that *s not an extrajudicial confession.

MR. QLIJLM:

Well, it's not exactly the same, but we

do have —
Q

Ho *

MVi. OMAN s
Q

confessions which were inadmissible»

fell, my question is, do you know of any ease

34
in this Court that has held that the admission in violation of
the Constitution of an extrajudicial confession could ever be
harmless error?
Q

Any Klstsnda cases, for example?

MRc OLIANs

Any Miranda —• no. I'm sorry, Your Honor,

I didn’t cite any.

Q

Weil, do yon know of any?

Q

Do you know of any?

Q

Just for information.

MR. OLIAM:
Q

Offhand, I don't know, no.

Sorry.

Hasn’t this Court, and haven’t other courts

often commented on the fact that confession by its very
nature is so devastating a piece of evidence
that it just can't
?

be disregarded?
MR. Oil All;

Your Honor, my reading of the case which

suggests it to me is that where you clearly found that a
confession was coerced, in the sense of psychological, physical
and the like, that that is true.
ioh’t feel that in terms of a Messiah type situation
that that rule should fee applied.
kind of thing.

1 don’t think it's the same

I think what we're talking about is a situation

-and, again, I'm not granting that Messiah governs this, I’m
net granting that -Messiah should be granted retroactively.
But it seems to me that that abridgement of that
Sixth Amendment right, under those circumstances, should not

Jb

automatically result in a reversal.
ihirt: In that, context, yes, the harmless error
doctrine in that context should apply.
That is how I read the cases the petitioner is
primarily relying upon, and how I read the cases of this Court,
and that's what I'm urging»
2 think, perhaps, I ought to turn to the question of
Massiah and retroactivity»
•Tit •■.riwigarvi *

I've suggested in my brief, and I

would get to this quickly as far an the facts go, that I don't
feel that it is desirable to extend Massiah, and I think that
particularly we pointed out i-i this case that what you have is
situation where the prisoner volunteered his information to a
total stranger»

I think that's a distinction worth considering

Because 2 think if Masaiah •—
q

How do you get this "volunteered"? is that the

word you just used?
HR» OLIAft:

On the basis of this record?

MR. OLiaS;

MR. OLXAMs Well, what I’m saying is —<
Q

You don't really mean he volunteered, do you?

MR. OHM’}:

Mr. Justice, what I mean in this

situation is that what happened in that cell did not amount to
a coerced confession.
0

What did he do?

He asked him some —

Well, suppose when he was first arrested the

police questioned him when they first picked him up, and then
questioned him again later in the afternoon* and then the
next morning, woke him up in the middle of the night and
questioned him,, and then woke him up again in the middle of
the night and questioned him.

Would you think that would be

coercive?
MR. OLIPI-?;

Mr. Justice, there are cases -—

Would you consider that to be coercive?

Q

Wall, now, the only difference is that in my

hypothetical the man knew he was a policeman, and in this case
he didn’t know he was a policeman.
MR. QLXMf:
Q

No, Mr. —

Are there any other differences?

MR. OL1AN:
lot of differences.

Yesf Mr. Justice, I think there are a
1 think what has happened here is that

ha2s in the cell and he’s asking him some questions.

He makes

some absurd accusations.
He Scald,. "What kind of psychological inducement was
there?"
"Well, he shared his oatmeal in the morning.”

He

let him steal some candy bars. "And a few times”, he said,
"well, I. acted crazy.0
Now, I don’t think that that’s psychological
coercion of the petitioner.

As far as the petitioner goes,

said in his own testimony at the trial:

"No, he didn’t

wake me up at all.”
Officer Langford said, ”1 woke him up about twice.”
Woke dim twice»
Q

Wall, my final question is;

how do you explain

38

'officer Langford8s statement, that !,Iie broke down*5?
MR. Old if ?

Your Honor, I don't think we have to

«semine each word ’ that meticulously.

Why he u&ed those

particular words# X don't know.
But I think if you view the facts, even as Officer
Langford told those facts# that ifc doesn't coite close to any

of the cases where this Court has ruled that a confession was
coerced.
There As no constant questioning by a larga number of
officers for hours on end, in.the odd hours in the morning»
Officer Langford said, "Well, he woke up a couple times? he
woke up easily.w
interrogate him.

But he didn't question, he didn't constantly
He was in the cell, and occasionally, as

Langford tells it, the petitioner even denies it —- as Langford
tells it, he says,

"Well# I got back to the subject again; I

accused him of all kinds of things,1" and he said, MI acted
crasy."
But I don't think that this case in any sense com­
pares to the cases where this Court has ruled that a confession
was coerced.

Q

How dr you think it compares to the Massiah

MR. OLXSsSJ:

Mr. Justice, I think it -comes much

c lessor to
3

Which didn't have anything to do with whether or

39
not a confession was cberced,
MR, OLlAHs
Q

Right, it does not,

— contrary to what the District Court Said.

MR. OLIMIs

It doss not.

That’s right.

those two issues have to be kept quite clear.

I think

X think it comes

much closer to Massiah.
I think we have urged in our brief that Masslab
should not bo extended, because the implications are that,
for example, you could have the situation where you say. Well.»
the guard in the jailhcuse said to another prisoner, asked
bin if ha killed him; and he says, "Yeah, X killed hinr‘, to
the guard.

You say, Well, the guard can’t come into court.

Q

well, in that ~ my question iss

that this- comas within the Messiah case?

do you think

Quite apart from

whether Hassiah is retroactive, that, after all, is the basxc
issue in this case.
MR. OLXAN:

Mr. Justice, as I suggested, I think it

cornea closer to Hasslab than to coercion.

I don’t thank

Mansigh should necessarily govern.
q

You contend in your brief that Mass!ah is

distinguishable, do you not?
MR. OajIAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's correct.

X contend it's distinguishable, and the point I’m trying to maJ
is, l don’t think Messiah should be extended beyond its facts,
laid I set forth the re&tion&le.

40

X think perhaps the most important issue -*•
Q

Do you. know the . McLeod case from Ohio?

MR, OLX&K s

Yes f 2C do.

Yes, 1 do.

:.n that particular case, however £.. Mr, Justice, it
was

there was nothin? in what this Court said to indicate

the position of this Court.
Q

Kof I'm just talking about your claim that

Massian should tot be extended beyond its own facts,

It has

:>rjun extended, at least to the facts of the McLeod case? has it
not?
MR, OLI&Nt

Mr-3 Justice, it has? I would urge that it

should not he extended any more than absolutely necessary.
Q

Beyond Mass!ah and McLeod?

MR, OLIMs
Q

Yes.

Do yen know what the facts were in the McLeod

«as®?
MR. OLXAtf *
Q

Well, let it go-; you needn't find them.

Q

X have thorn here somewhere.

At the moment I can't recall,

Well, bit, Olian, no matter how much we under™

take to *— you undertake, X should say, to rationalize the

MR, OLXAM:

It was more than that? maybe 3S, 40 hours,

something like that.

Forty-eight: hours.

MR. OLIAJIj
Q

Yes,

He stayed there 48 hours, and got what he went

for?
MR, OLXAMt
Q

Yes.

lifter the man had a lawyer?

MR. GLXANs

Correct.

Correct.

I would like to point to the other issue that I think
that v/e’ve been talking about.
7 think if all of these —- I 've been presenting these
arguments as "even ifs"f 1 think that perhaps 1 have not made
clear to the Court.

I do fool that if you feel that this case

is governed by Messiah, even in view of what X *v© told you
before, that Massi&h should not be declared retroactively.
Up to this point four circuits have said Massiah should not be
declared retroactively,
Mow, the petitioner suggests, wall, that this would
..-a a normal application.

X don't think that in modern

vri'-jiaal law retroactivity is a normal application. And 1
think that the decisions of this Court have made that
absolutely clear.
You've stated the factors that are important.

You've

; v-.-,.thai: ±u the combinati on of those factors, and you've

42
ruled in a number of cases on whether particular decisions
should be retroactive or not.
And it seems to ms that the same rationale which
governed in the Johnson casethe name rationale which governed
in fact, in iinklatterr applies to this particular case.
We talk about the purpose to be served.

The purpose

to be served in this particular case is to deter the police
ibitinterrogating when a lawyer is not present.
How, that purpose has already been solved by Mas siah?
to make Massiah retroactive adds nothing additional to the
utility, to the practical outcome of that particular decision.
Q

Did Masaiah overrule any previous decisions?

Let's see, Mapp did, and which would *— you've
mentioned Linkletter.
MR. Qhim:

But did Massiah?
I don't think it did, Mr. Justice.

1' didn't feel, personally, reading the cases of this Court
1 don't feel, and X didn't feel, and I still don't feel that
that single explicit point is telling one way or the other.
X think the rationale —*
Q

But it has to do with reliance —

MR. OLIAKt

Yes.

The prior history, prior reliance,

it 'yds to two different doctrines, which have been stated by
this Court.

I don’t think that specific question alone should

tell, should be telling in terms of the final outcome of this
case.

43
X do feel that t'hs rationale is clear enough, again,
avid it*3 the co;abi nation of all these factors,

And 1 think

tins decisions in Johnson, the•decision in Linklatter, make it
clear enough that the purpose, first of all, the purpose would
n.ot ha served by making it retroactive.
1 think, secondly? that in this type of situation,
in a Ma-ssiah situation., in Messiah, the confession that was
elicited in Massiah was not one that was believed to be
coerced, it was not one that was believed to be unreliable?
in fact, it was believed to be all too reliable.
And sc the basis for getting rid of that kind of
evidence by making the rule retroactive, again, is not
necessary in this particular situation.

We're not talking

about right to counsel at trial, which so infuses the entire
trial with possibilities of error that you have to make it
retroactive to protect the right of the individual.
’ Third, ~
Q

But Massiah specifically said that this was

true since Pet-fell ,v. Alabama.
MR. 0L1AK:
distinctions there.
Q

Mr. Justice, I think there are some
1 think —

That’s on page 205.

"This view no more than

.reflects the constitutional principle established long ago in
Powell v, Alabama.,"
MR. OLIANs

And then it quotes from Powell.
Your Honor, I feel that what we*re

44
talking about in those two decisions are distinguishable.

In

the dread nease they5re talking about right fco counsel# but
Maseiah is vary socoifio, and Mass!ah is talking about a situat
where he’s in custody, he’s released, and they have this setup
with an informer.
Q

And he’s been indicted,

MR. OMAN:
Q

Yes,

Yes.

And he-’s been indicted.

And he has a lawyer.

In this particular situation what we’re

and in Powell what we’re talking about was th©

right to have an appointed lawyer in a capital case? and I
don’t think that, although they talk about. SiKth teendment
guarantees in the broad context,, I don’t think they’re exactly
the same#
And again in terms of the three criteria e-st up by
this Courtf I don’t think, X don’t ae©5 and in terms of the
decisions in Miranda and Escobedo, X don’t sea any other
possibility, logically, but to make Masaiah nan-retroactive.
The third factor is the strain on ‘the judicial
system, and here I think'in one of those two decisions, which
X ear just rsfsrrisg to* this Court pointed out th© problems
aslafad to hearings on • evidence long destroyed and hearings
bused on memories that are disused by time.

n

Mow common do you think «— how common a practice

*T:U3 this i do you suppose, before Mas si ah?
MR, OLX&N:
Q

Mr. Justice,

Going now to your point as to the strain on the

judicial system*
MR, GLIiWs

Mr, Justice, in Johnson and in Young vs*

United States, in the Fifth Circuit, there are comments to the
effect that these ware cowmen practices,

And I think that,

there’s another —
O

Post-indictment, after a man’s been indicted

and after he has a lawyer, for the government deliberately to
gat at him and interrogate him further.
MR, CSLlKSt

Mr, Justice, it's awfully hard to get

statistics on that.
Q

Well, I ask this only because ~~ 1 just relied

on my own recollection — 1 don’t remember that since McLeod
we've had a single — that this question has arisen here, on
the
MR. OLIAH:
Q

— retroactivity of Massiah.

MR. OLIAi!:
Q

No, Your Honor, this follows —

Yes.

And that's the reason that that suggests to me

Ibofc this is & vo,cy rare practice.
MR, OLXAl\Ti

X would hope it was.

Well, the other — those, two eases you

suggest, it is not a rare practice.

Secondly -- chf my time has expired.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Well, you may answer the
question, of course.
MR„ OLIAN2

Okay.

Secondly, I think that one of the problems in this
particular type of situation is that, whether or not there is
s great deal of reliance, a lot of petitioners are going to be
sitting there and thinking, Well, what I can say is that this
find s:;, whatever you want to call it, duplicity or deception
pas practiced on me? now let’s go and got an evidentiary
hearing,
How are those claims going to fas solved?
The reason that they’re going to do that is obvious,
They can’t get Miranda and Escobedo applied retroactively, sc
they’ll say. Well, I’ll change my story, so that it falls
within the aegis of Massiah, and therefore I can get an
evidentiary hearing and perhaps get a new trial and get it
dismissed*
Q

Kell, they could change their story to say

■they ware denied their rights guaranteed by Powell v, Alabama
or by Gideon v. Wainwright.
MR. QtiZMii Well, that’s true, Mr. Justice, but those

vr.; tif.::-.js which can easily be established one way or another
by the record .

This; type of situation cannot so easily be

■rtablished by the record.

He could say, Well, —

Q

Well, it was in

MR. OLIAN:
Q

It was in

Why wouldn't the

MR. OlIAN:

Well, whs

the broad purview of Mass!aha prisoner could say, Well, at
the time I was questioned this policsraan cold me he- was someone
else, not a policeman but someone else; now I realise that —
Q

The record would show that,, wouldn't it?

The record of the trial, whether or not a policeman interrogate!
a man after he'd been indicted and after he had a lawyer, and
then, further, testified at that man's trial on behalf of the
prosecution? and the record would show that for all time,
wouldn't it?
-

MR, GLIMJs

Mr. Justice, I think that record would

show it in 1970 or *71; but we * re talking about a case which
took place before Massiah, and those records would not have
•• ed this issue of deception, it seems to me, because I
don't think it was ever clear at that time, and this Court
points it out in Johnson —
Q

Well» if there had been any cross-examination

at all of the prosecution witness, it would have been brought
out, the circumstances under which ha —
MR. QLLM4:

Well, they might have, four Honor, but

not as a constitutional right which was —
Q

But the facts would be in the record?

48

MR. OLI AH:

Yes.

Oh, it's possible.

It8 a possible,

but not always,
We read many records every day where
Q

But we wouldn’t have any problem if the record

was like this one# would we?
MR. OLlANs

Mr. Justice, 1 think you still "nave some

problems, because there are —
Q

No, X mean about your problem, you wouldn't —~

MR. OLIAKf:

Not that problem, but. you still have

problems
Q

That's the only case we have right now is that

one.
MR. OLIANs

Yes, Mr. Justice, but we're talking about

the broad application of this rule.

And I'm trying to suggest

that, consistent with standards set forth by this Court,
Macslab should not be applied retroactively? and I’ve'been
trying to suggest why it should not be.
Q

All right,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Olian.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Rutledge?
MR. RUTLEDGES

No, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rutledge, you acted

your assistance to the client you represent.
