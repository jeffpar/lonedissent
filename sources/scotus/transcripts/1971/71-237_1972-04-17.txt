ORAL ARGUMENT OP MRS. MARIA L. MARCO;-;
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER'
MRS. MARCUS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court t
This habeas corpus proceeding presents the question
of whether New York is prohibited; from using a 1964 Tennessee
murder conviction as a predicate for increased punishment.
This Tennessee conviction resulted from a retrial where; the
prior recorded testimony of a witness was read into the recc,v
because the witness had since moved to Sweden.
To state briefly the history of the Tennessee and
New York proceedings;

The crime of which respondent Stubbs

nor; convicted, was a 1954 murder of Mrs. Alex Holm.

Stubbs

mot Mr. and Mrs. Holm, an elderly Swedish couple who were
strangers to him, at a roadside picnic table.

He kidnapped

thorn at gunpoint and ultimately murdered Mrs. Holm, end
seriously wounded her husband.
At Stubbs’ 1954 trial, defendant was represented bythree appointed counsel.

Alex Holm testified, as did Stubbs

himself,ani Stubbs was convicted of first-degree
kidnapping, and assault with intent to murder»
Nine years later, Stubbs move

rit of

corpus in the District Court in Tennessee, asking that ' la
conviction be vacated on the grounds that his attorney;;
appointed three days before trial.
The District Court, under a former Circuit Court
rule which required automatic reversal in cases of tardy
apointment of counsel, vacated Stubbs' first trial and remanded
him for possible retrial.
At the second trial, in 1964, the prosecutor sent
a subpoena'to Ales Holm's former address, a farm in Texas,
which was returned unsigned, and he also contacted Holm * s cor. ,
who advised the court, that his father was now a permanent
resident of Sweden.
His son took the stand and so testified.

The prioi

testimony of Holm was then read into the record, over objection
by counsel.
Stubbs was among the witnesses who testified.

How long had he served on the first sentence?

about two more years.

The dissenti

s
judge, Leonard P. Moore, called the majority decision an
extraordinary sample of justice dispensed by the federal courts»
We urge reversal of the decision below on three
grounds;

First, that there was no lack of due diligence in

obtaining the presence of the witness.

Second, that even

assuming that due diligence was not exercised, the error in
this case would have bean harmless.

And third, that tardy

appointment of counsel at the first trial did not in fact
deprive respondent Stubbs of effective legal assistance.
Baroer vs. Page was not violated by the use of
testimony of a witness permanently domiciled on a foreign
continent.

This Court, in Barber vs. Page, ruled that a good •

faith effort must be made to have a witness present prior to
reading his testimony into the record at another trial.
Q

Does it appear, Mrs. Marcus, whether any offer

was made to pay the expense

MRS, MARCUS;
indicate that.

Nothing in the —

There's nothing in the record to

Of course, this was not only before this Court

decided Barber but even before this Court decided Pointer.
However, it should be pointed out that it would have
been greatly to the prosecutor's advantage to have this
witness at the trial, simply because he was a victim to a very,
very tragic circumstance; his wife had been murdered; he, himself,

7
was shot twice in the face.

And of course the sympathetic

effect of such testimony on the jury would have been much
greater than simply —
Q

What was the purpose of the guest offense?

That

it was not a felony murder?
MRS.MARCUS;

Yes.

I think that's why the court

below seised on that,
Q

Was he convicted of a felony murder or of a

MRS.MARCUS;

He was convicted of first-degree

murder; the judge charged both felony murder and common-law
murder.
Q

He may have been — or that he may have been

convicted on a premeditated murder?
MRS. MARCUS;
Q

Yes.

And what8s the significance the guest theory?

MRS. MARCUS; Apparently the court belcw felt that
since Stubbs himself testified to the ownership of the gun*
and the fact that he kidnapped the Holms and compelled them
to drive to the spot where the shooting occurred; but he said
that —
Q

Well

,

would the evidence have supported -- did

the Tennessee Supreme Court indicate that the evidence did or
didn't support a first-degree common-law ~MRS. MARCUS;

Q

Oh, yes.

—- premeditated — it did?

MRS. MARCUS:
Q

Yes.

Well, then, you're arguing harmless error, or

suggesting it in any way?
MRS. MARCUS:

We*re arguing, in any event, that,

as far as harmless error is concerned, that the guest theory
has no relation because, in fact, for fcvro reasons:
all, in respect to the exercise of due diligence,

First of
’64 counsel

didn't indicate that if the witness had been there they would
have asked him any questions ’about the guest theory at all?
second, the guest theory was completely refuted by the record,
because —
Q

And you said he took the stand, in — what was i

the first, of second trial?.
MRS. MARCUS:
Q

He took the stand in the first trial.

Did the testimony indicate that he was a gut. 1.

MRS. MARCUS: Quite the contrary.

What Holm was

“Did relations ever be­

"No, sir, there was no friendly relations."

And he replied

So that the court

erroneously assumed that --Q

MRS. MARCUSs

No, this was — nov; we're speaking of

Alex Holm.
Q

Oh.

MRS. MARCUS:

He made this reply.

There was a—

9
Q

I know, but when Stubbs took the stand, did he

offer testimony from which the guest theory —
MRS. MARCUSi

The testimony that he offered was

that Mrs. Holm, when he was pointing a pistol in her face,
asked him to put the pistol down and that she would give him
no trouble.

And I think there was an attempt by 554 counsel

to say that this was an expression of friendship.

Q

Mrs. Marcus, if I might —

Q

So that possible friendship was at least hinted

at in the first trial?
MRS. MARCUS; It was hinted at by virtue of his <sa\
"They told me they would give me no trouble.81
Q

Mrs. Marcus, if I could bade up a minute.

The

first conviction was upset because of ineffective counsel?
MRS. MARCUS;

It was not — not any finding on the
'i

record that counsel was ineffective, but because of a rule
mandating automatic reversal in cases where counsel was
tardily appointed.
Q
average case?

Now, the period of —

Don41 you- think that’s different from the
Because, I would assume that if counsel had more

time, he might have been able to ask more questions.
MRS. MARCUS: Well, in this case —
Q

On cross-examination.

MRS. MARCUS;

— in this case, in the first place,

the record shows that the cross-examination was capably

.10
handled as was the direct examination.

Also, as the Tennessee

Supreme Court pointed out, it * s very difficult to ~~
Q

Did the Court of Appeals find that to be true?

MRS. MARCUS: The Court of Appeals?

It mads no

reference whatsoever to lack of preparation time, or the
kind of question that could have been asked, except for the
guest theory.

That was the only basis on which harmless error

was rejected.
But not only does the record show that Stubbs was
effectively represented by three counsel, by the way, not only
one? but this
0

We11, if I remember correctly, in the, Scottsworth

trial they had 20-some counsel.
MRS. MARCUS:
Q

Yes.

And this Court upset that, so the number doesn't

help.
MRS. MARCUS:

1 think the record helps a great deal,

though, because, in reading it, it’s clear that — in fact, I
think what makes it clearer yet —
Q

You see, 1 have great difficulty in looking at

a record and deciding as to what somebody would say on the
second hearing.

I assume that at the second trial the lawyer

looked at the record of the first trial ana finds, "Gee, 1
should have asked that question.ts
MRS. MARCUS:

Well, we were given

*

Q

And he then has the opportunity to ask it.

But

he didn't in this case.
MRS. MARCUS:

We were given a little assistance as to

what would have happened, because "64 counsel brought into the
record the questions that they would have asked.
It's first notable that they made no mention of a
guest theory whatsoever? and it's second notable that with a
lot of time to research into Ho Iron ’ s past life, they didn't
discover anything about his background which could have formed
a basis for cross-examination.
Q

Well, how do you know what they might have

wanted to ask him.
MRS, MARCUS?

They said — they read it into the

record, and it is — it's
Q

They read into the record that they couldn't

think of another question they would have wanted to ask him?
MRS. MARCUS:
Q

No.

If he'd been there?

MRS. MARCUS;

But hs listed the questions that they

would have asked and said — they further added, there might
have been other questions? but these were the ones that —
on the basis of —
Q

Are those questions in this record, Mrs.

Marcus?
MRS. MARCUS? They are, indeed; yes.

12
Q

Can you tell us what page?

MRS, MARCUS:

It’s on page 73.

Q

Pace 73?

Thank you.

Q

So what difference would it have made if ha

was a guest; how would that have helped the defendant?
MRS. MARCUS: Well, the court below felt that it might
have helped the defendant because if -— Stubbs? testimony,
since he said on the stand that he kidnapped the Holms at
gunpoint and compelled them to drive to the spot where the
shooting occurred, this evidence was rather overwhelming, and
the court below thought that the guest theory might show that
if there was a felony which had come to an end, that there
might be more to say about the circumstances of the shooting,
I think that's why they brought in the guest theory.
Q

Well, wasn't it a felony murder conviction?

MRS. MARCUS:
conviction.

Well, it was a first-degree murder

The judge charged both felony murder and pre­

meditated murder.
Q

Well, if the defendant was a guest, there

couldn't have been a felony murder; right?
MRS. MARCUS:
Q

Right.

MRS. MARCUS:
Q

That was the idea,—
So then how would —
— that 1 think the court below had,,

How would that have helped him?

MRS. MARCUS: Well, it would have helped him simply

13
on the felony murder aspect, but not on the first-degree
trturde r aspect.
Q

And they did convict him of first-degree

murder?
MRS. MARCUS:
Q

Yes, apparently so.

But i suppose it3s a matter of Tennessee State

law, if the judge charges the jury that they may find him
guilty of first-degree murder on either —
MRS. MARCUS;
Q

— the theory or —

MRS. MARCUS;
Q

On either ground.

It could have included either one.

And it turns out that one of the theories mir;'

not have been supported in evidentiary? that would be

reversible

even though the other theory were adequately supported?
MRS. MARCUS;

In Barber, this Court discussed the

reading of preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who was
in a federal prison

across the State border.

The Court

pointed out that increased cooperation between the States and
the Federal Government meant that State process could cross a
State border, and that States could issue writs of habeas
corpus ad testificandum, that Federal courts had the power to
issue such writs at the request of State prosecutorial
authorities„
This Court has, in fact, never ruled on the question
of what good faith means in the context of a witness who is

14
not in the United States or in a territory of the United
States, but is beyond the reach of compulsory process „ by a
State prosecutor»
However, a number of State court and lower court
*>

decisions, Federal decisions, indicate that proof that a
witness is living on a foreign continent at the time of trial
is sufficient to establish unavailability»
And cases in which it has been found that due
diligence was not exercised have been those in which the
witness might have been in the jurisdiction.
We ask this Court not to extend Barber vs. Page to
overseas witnesses beyond the State9s reach by Compulsory
process, but insted to adopt the rationale already set out by
many courts that good faith in an overseas witness is shew::
by establishing that he is residenced there.
Mow, respondent attempts two counterveiling argument i
hare.

First, that the
Q

You mean that's the rule that doesn't require in

any instance, then, that the State offer to pay his expenses
to come hare?
HRS. MAkCuS:

It would not establish a constitutional

' duty to do so, where the witness is beyond the reach of
compulsory process.
Q

Well, is it suggested that no inquiry ba made

of him at all, if it's discovered that he's permanently

residenced overseas?
MRS. MARCOS: The suggestion 'is that it would not be
part of the constitutional duty of the prosecutor to do so.
Q

Well, where does the?duty end?

What’s to foe

done fov the prosecutor?
MRS. MARCUS:

Well, as far as what the prosecutor

may — in cases, for example,where the travel expenses are not
too onerous, he may well feel that having-the witness present
would foe to his advantage, and he would pursue it regardless
of what the -~
Q

No, but what — l*m sorry, I don’t understand

what you’re suggesting would be the constitutional limit of
the- prosecutor -MRS. MARCUSs The establishment of his residence
overseas, as far as the —
' Q

Well, once that’s established, whether it’s

Mexico, Canada, no matter where it is ~
MRS.
Q
MRS.
Q

MARCUS:Right.
that that’s the end

ofit?

MARCUS: That it’s —
So ha can use the prior testimony?

MRS. MARCUS:

As far as his constitutional duty is

concerned, yes,
Q
and say;

It doesn't even require him to send a letter

"If you don’t mind, would y«3U mind coming over and

16
testifying"?
MRS, MARCUS;

I think that where’s there no compulsory

p rocess to back this up, we ask this Court to say that the limit
of the duty would he the establishment that the witness is
living overseas, and that is the rationale that these other
courts have adopted.
Q

That’s even if the witness is willing to come

over at his own expense?
MRS. MARCUS;

Well, if he’s willing to come, and the

prosecutor is aware of that, of course —
Q

Well, he wouldn’t know unless he —-

MRS. MARCUS;
Q

—■ he would bring him.

1 'm just saying that you wouldn’t even ask the

prosecutor to write a letter over and say:

"This case is

coming up, and if you could coma over, you'd be welcome"?
MRS. MARCUS:

Under the rule that these courts have

established, that would be in the prosecutor’s discretion
rather than a constitutional duty.
Q

Did the defense ask for an allowance to bring

Mr. Holm from Sweden?
MRS. MARCUS: ; Mo, they did not; they objected to the
witness not being there, but there was no reference to an
allowance of any kind.
Q

Did either side request a deposition?

MRSo MARCUS;

No.

No, Your Honor,

In other words,,

1?

the —
Q

Do you know whether, under Tennessee practice,

a deposition may be employed in a criminal case?
MRS. MARCUSs Well, the prior hearing testimony was
taken at a trial where the witness Holm was confronted, was
cross-examined, so that this testimony, I think, would have
been the most valid that they possibly could road into the
record.

It was taken at the first trial, under the usual

circumstances.
Q

Ten years closer to the event?

MRS. MARCUSt

It was directly after the event, yes,

Now --

Q

And the facts were that the State, in that soconc.

trial, served process on Holm at his last-known adress, which
was in Texas, in the United States of America?
MRS, MARCUS;
Q

Yes, they did,

And that was returned on — "moved"?

MRS. MARCUS; Right.
Q

And then was there any notification to him at

all in Sweden?
MRS. MARCUS; They then contacted his son, who
advised the court as to his whereabouts, and testified on the
stand as to his whereabouts.

Q

That he's moved to Sweden?

MRS. MARCUS;

Yes.

And —

Q

Was Holm himself ever notified?

MRS. MARCUS: There was a remark by '64 defense counsel
that quoted — referring to a newspaper interview where Holm's
son

was quoted as saying his father was not aware that the

trial was taking place, but even if this — of course this
i

was excluded as hearsay by the judge, but it’s interesting to
note that '64 defense counsel made no effort to cross-examir
*

the son at the stand as to whether or not his father knew.
So there's nothing,

in the record, really, no proper evidence

on this point.
Q

After the unsuccessful attempt to service in

Texas, *—
MRS. MARCUSs Right.
Q

that was the end of it, as far as counsel

was concerned?
MRS. MARCUS: As far as — except for the establish*!
of where he was.
Q

Through the son?

MRS. MARCUS: Right.
Now, respondent argues here that the Walsh Act, which
is 28 U.S.C. 1783, could somehow have been applied to subpoena
this witness.

That statute only empowered a Federal Court

to bring a witness before itself where the United States Attorney
or someone acting under his direction so desired.
It coulc not authorise a State prosecutor to bring a

19

witness to a State trial.

Indeed, our research, and a call

to the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern
District, has never revealed any ease in which it's been used
by State prosecutors to secure a witness in a

State trial.

Thus, it would have bean more than due diligence, it would
have been tfee height of ingenuity for the prosecutor to have
thought of that.

And it would have been unusable.

Here *—
Q

Mrs. Marcus, I take it that your position is the

State of New York is not bound by Judge Miller’s habeas corpus
ruling?
MRS. MARCUSs Right.

And this, there was an attempt

by respondent to argue that New York is in privity with
Tennessee and therefore this ruling would prevent us from
looking at the record at all, to determine whether counsel
was effective or not.
Nov;, this privity period might have some interest
if we were relying on the 1954 conviction as a predicate.
That was what was vacated.

But, in point of fact, we’re

relying on the '64 conviction, which was appealed to the
Supreme Court of Tennessee, and which included a ruling
that the cross-examination was effective.
Moreover, the district court never even considered
whether counsel in fact conducted a proper cross-examination
because it was operating on a par se rule that made that kind

20
of inquiry unnecessary.

So that it never dealt with the

question at all of whether the 854 counsel's cross-examination
was effective or not.

It did it merely on a per se rule,

which this Court, in Chambers v, 'Maroney, has since rejected.
This Court,in Chambersr held that the mere fact that counsel
is tardily appointed doesn't even call for a hearing
necessarily, much less automatic reversal.

It calls for an

inquiry into the record to find out whether, in fact, there
was effective representation.
Isd like to point out that even assuming that the
State should have sent a request to the witness prior to reading
his testimony in the record, the error in this case would have
been harmless, because the outcome of the trial would have
been the same whether the State had communicated with Holm
or not,
1

a better had been sent to Holm, and he had refused

to come to Tennessee, his prior testimony would have been read
into the record at the second trial.
Q

Suppose he had agreed to comp and pay his own

expenses?
MBS, MARCUS:

If he had agreed to come, I believe

hat it's beyond a reasonable doubt that he would have testified
the same way, for several reasons:
Q

First of all, the facts

Well, may I assume that the lawyer would have

additional questions?

«■•■i 0

d .£.

MRS.MARCUS; Well, as I said, he did list what he
would have had. But I think there are other reasons to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that he would have testified the same
way.
First of all, the facts were —
Q

My point is not on his testimony, my point is

on his cross-examination.
MRS. MARCUSs
Q

Ye3, I think that he would —

And 1 don’t think you can really, beyond a

reasonable doubt, determine what a lawyer would say in crossexamining a witness.
MRS. MARCUS;

I think, though, that looking at this

record and this witness, what we can say is that the witness
would have withstood cross-examination.
Q

Have you ever known every question he would ask

on cross-examination, before it started?
MRS. MARCUSs- No.
Q

No# Your Honor.

But

Thank you.

MRS. MARCUS?

— the question would be;

the witness have reacted to this cross-examination.
testimony was uncomplicated.

You mean Holm?

MRS. MARCUS;

Stubbs was a strong witness to e.

Q

How would

Stubbs had —

Stubb's identity, the

ownership of the gun, and the fact of the kidnapping were

22

corroborated by Stubbs himself.

And, moreover, Holm could

have refreshed his recollection by reading his prior
testimony from the earlier trial.

And 364 counsel, with plenty

of time to research into Holm's background, did not find
anything upon which to base new questions.
Q

At the trial, did Stubbs deny firing any gun?

MRS. MARCUS?

He testified at both trials, and ha

reiterated that when he was released from the Texas prison he

He had no money, no job prospects.

He said that he kidnapped the Holms at gunpoint.

This was all his testimony?

MRS. MARCUS:

Right.

arrested, arid a hospital room identification, in which Holm

Q

No gunshot wound?

MRS. MARCUS s There was some testimony that a bullet
might have grafted him, yes.
Q

Didn't Stubbs also offer the explanation, when

he was first apprehended, that he had fallen off a cliff wh?1
he was fishing, and that was how he got the blood on. him?
MRS. MARCUS:

Yes, he told that — it was the fin t

story that he told the police officers, that the blood was
there only because he had had an accident while fishing and
he had slipped on a cliff,
The disputed testimony of Alex Holm, of course,
paralleled that of Stubbs himself, as to the fact that Stubbs
had kidnapped there and compelled them to drive to the spot
where the shooting occurred.
Now, the hospital room identification was not
objected to, and the police officers testified in court, at

24
both trials, as to that identification,

Q

Mrs. Marcus, I gather, in this instance, the

only issue before us is whether the State did what it should
have done in bringing Mr. Holm back for the second trial?
MRS, MARCUS;

Well, whether — even if not, it

would have been harmless error in the context of the over­
whelming evidence in this case.
Q

But apart from that?

I just want to be clear.

On the basic issue?

Your position is that as far as the

State need go is to satisfy itself that the witness permanently
resides overseas, and that satisfies any constitutional
obligation it has?
MRS. MARCUS;

Insofar as the witness is resident

beyond —
Q

Yes.

MRS. MARCUS;
Q

— the reach of compulsory process.

Because he's living in some foreign country.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE K. CARPENTER, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR* CARPENTER: Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please
the court s
Perhaps in order to clarify the questions that are
raised, I should address myself first to what happened, the
facts of the case, at the Tennessee trial a little bit*
The uncontroverted testimony was that some 55 miles
away from the homicide, the place where the homicide took
place, in another part of Tennessee, Stubbs approached Mr. and
Mrs. Holm.

Now, Stubbs was hungry.

He had been without food,

this is Stubbs9 testimony, for some time.

He was desperate.

He wanted a rid®, to get up to New York where he had relation
He asked, he approached the Holms, asked them for
a ride? was refused? went away.
he had the gun.

And then he said he remembered

Ee came back, forced his way in their car.

He drove. They were in the back seat.

And away they went.

Now, at this point, of course, we have serious mis­
conduct .
Now, the testimony of Stubbs was that very shortly
after this trip began, the friendly relations began to exist
between him and the Holms.

They began to express sympathy

for his condition, and said, MI£ you'd only asked us properly
for a ride, we would have given you one.”

Or food.

So that

this, Stubbs said, happened about four miles after the trip

2?
began.
Q

Now, you say Stubbs said this. Did he so

testify at both trials?
MR. CARPENTER:
Q

Yes* he did.

Ha did?

MR. CARPENTERS

Yes,

Nowy the trip continued. They passed through towns.
Stubbs says they passed a polio© officer.
their way.

They continue on

And, all of a sudden, •—
Q

Didn’t he also say right at that point that h.:

put the gun down on the seat of the car?
MR. CARPENTER:
Q

Yes.

And that that was so that the police officers and

others wouldn’t see the gun?

Yes.

At the request of Mrs.

He had, had it, he said, in his

him,
Q

He didn't throw the gun away, though, at any

time, or offer to give it to the Holms?MR. CARPENTER?, No.

No, he did not.

But, at any rate, according to the defense point
of view, the gun is on the side of the seat beside Mr. Stubbs,
He feels that friendly relations have been developed.
feels at ease.

He

And then, they come across a place where there's

28
some people nearby.

According to Holm, Stubbs took the gun and

turned around and started shooting, while the car is still
moving? and shot the wife and shot Mr. Holm twice.
Q

They were both in the back seat?

MR. CARPENTER; They were both in the back seat.
Q

Did they both agree on that, Stubbs and Holm

agree that the two were in the back seat?
MR. CARPENTER:

Oh, yes.

Yes.

There's no question.

Mrs. Holms was sitting more or less in the middle, there was
some luggage off to the left, and Mr. Holm was on the far
right.
Now, Stubbs testified that he did not shoot anyone?
that, as he was driving, he was suddenly hit on the head,
presumably by the gun, and the car crashed and he struggled
out and got away, and escaped.
Now, the trial judge in Tennessee —
Q

But he says then he doesn't know how they were

shot?
MR. CARPENTER;

He doesn’t know how they were shot.

He presumes that — ha says Mr. Holm has the gun, and ha had
to struggle to get it away, and then
Q

•

That who had to struggle to get it away?

MR. CARPENTER; Stubbs had to struggle.

Q

And did he get it away from Holm?
MR. CARPENTER;

No, because the gun was found in the

29
ear„ in the back seat of the car.

The back seat.

When the

police officers arrived.
Now, the trial judge in —
Q

And did the ear crash in fact?

MR. CARPENTER; The car didn’t crash, it went off the
road and wound up in a ditch, pointing in the same direction
that it had been traveling.
The trial judge charged, and I have quoted this
portion in the appendix to the brief, it’s not part of the
printed record, that if this theory were accepted by the jury,
they should acquit.
So I think then that as to the question of whether
or not Mr. Holm's testimony was crucial or devastating, there
should be no question in the case as to that, certainly, there
was no other witness —
Q

Ha was the only eyewitness for the prosecution?

MR. CARPENTER;

He was the only eyewitness for the
t

prosecution, yes, Your Honor.

And he was the only witness, if

you include Stubbs’ testimony — Stubbs being present in the
car — who said that Stubbs had done the shooting.

Well,

certainly, this is different from those cases where confronta­
tion is considered in the context of a peripheral statement,
that may or may not have affected the outcome.
Q

But this subject of the alleged friendly

relations, the happy relationship' that developed, was explored

30

at the first trial, was it not?
MR. CARPENTER:

It was not adequately explored at

the first trial.
Q

Nof but it was explored, though?

MR. CARPENTER:

It was explored by reason of Mr.

Stubbs' testimony.
Q

Yes.

MR. CARPENTER: Now, I gather the —
Q

And then of course Mr. Holm was examined on the

same subject, and he said there were no friendly relations at
all?
MR. CARPENTER s

Yes.

Now, the transcript of the first trial, I just had
occasion to read it last week, is not part of the records of
this Court, 1611 leave the copy, the certified copy that I
obtained from Tennessee with the Clerk.
first, at the first Tennessee trial.

But Holm testified

He was the first witness-

And. my impression, in reading that transcript is that counsel
who cross-examined him then, and this part is reproduced
in the Appendix, were not aware of the defense that was to be
offered.

2 mean, my feeling is that they didn't

learn of

this until Stubbs testified, until he told his story.
1 think there's a clear indication of the fact
that counsel were unprepared at this first trial.
Q

Yov mean in three days, couldn't three lawyers

31
have found that out if that were a valid notion?
MR, CARPENTER;

Welly

they might have.

But this case

involved people who were from out of State, people that were
not local people? both the Holms and the Stubbses.

The

counsel perhaps might have learned? but they didn't.
At any rate, X
Q

Maybe it didn’t occur to the defendant until he

got on the stand?
HR. CARPENTER; Well, it's possible.

But his testimony

was straightforward at both trials to this, there was no
conflict over the years.
Q

I would think that all they would have to do

to learn of it was just to interview their own client.
MR. CARPENTER *

I don't know.

Yes.

1 should think they might have

You really need to have

What's apparent here as after-

sight when we’ve had plenty of chance to consider the record
and explore it don’t often — these matters which seem so
clear now are net so clear when you first get a case.
Q

But Holm came back on the stand in rebuttal,

didn't he?
MR. CARPENTER:
Q

Yes.

After the defendant’s testimony?

MR. CARPENTERs

Yes.

Yes, he was —

32
0

And ha was available then for cross-examination?

MR. CARPEHTERs

Yes, but no questions ware asked.

Oh, there were three questions that were asked as to a story
that — an attempt was made to impeach- Mr, Holm at this point,
an abortive attempt.

Three questions were asked as to what--

whether he had told a conflicting story to an undertaker.

And

it never really reached the point of impeaching.
Q

It may not, but certainly

a confrontation of

Holm was had when he took the stand in rebuttal, wasn’t it?
MR. CARPENTER §
Q

Yes .

Well, constitutionally, Stubbs can81 complain

that he didn't have an opportunity for confrontation.

What

you’re suggesting is it’s ineffective assistance of counsel,
aren81 you?
MR. CARPENTER:
Q

Yes,

Well, of course, what —

What did. Judge Miller later say?

MR, CARPENTERS What did Judge Miller say, Your Honor?
Q

Yes, when he — I gather —

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes,

Judge Miller said — and his

decision is printed as an appendix to our brief -- "The Court
is of the opinion that the evidence sad the record show that
the constitutional rights of petitioner Stubbs ware violated
at the time of his trial in. the Criminal Court cf Sullivan
County", that’s the '54 trial, "in that his court-appointed
counsel did not have adequate and sufficient time within which

33
to prepare the necessary defense prior to going to trial,
and as a result the petitioner we denied affective representa­
tion by counsel."
Now, earlier in his decision, he recites that he
considered the testimony of Stubbs and the entire record9 to
reach this determination.

This determination was not apparently

questioned by the Tennessee authorities.

They acquiesced

in. this decision in promptly awarding a retrial in 1964.
Q

Is it critical to your case whether or not

representation was effectivo or ineffective?
MB. CARPENTER:
Q

Well, there are two ~

Let's assume for the moment that there was no

question whatsoever as to the effectiveness of counsel at the
first trial.
MR. CARPENTER: Then, as in Barber v. Page, assume
that there was effective cross-examination, there still was a
denial of confrontation.

There was a denial of confrontsfei>n

because the prosecution needed to make a good-faith effort ;o
obtain the presence of this witness Holm at the second trial.
Q

You’re saying that it8s just as though Holm

was living ten miles away and they thought if would be more
convenient to use his prior testimony than call him?
MR. CARPENTERS

Yes.

In fact, there is an indica­

tion in the record, as my sister pointed out, that Mr. Holm
was not even apprised of the fact that there was a trial pending.

34
He didn't even know about it, let alone be asked whether he.
wanted to come to the trial, let alone be asked whether he'd
be willing to come and pay his expenses —
Q

But 1 gather New York doesn't deny this. There

was no communication directly with him at all, at least on
the part of any State official?
MR. CARPENTER;
deny this.

Yes. I take it New York doss not

It seems -Q

I thought Mrs. Marcus had ,(.answered some questions

asked, and conceded this,
MR. CARPENTER:

Yes.

Yes.

•There is a further indication in the Tennessee
’

record jbhat counsel had been informed by the Tennessee
prosecutor that Mr. Holm would be produced.

At least one

lawyer made a remark, and it's cited in — the page reference
is cited in the brief, that —
Q

j

With different lawyers at the second trial?

MR. CARPENTER;

Yes, different lawyers at different

steps.
Q

That waish51 really admissible evidence» was it?

It wasn't at the State level with counsel where the trial
judge was
MR. CARPENTER;
Q

Yes.

— the trial judge refused to consider?

MR. CARPENTERs

Yes.

It was a remark of counsel

addressed, I believe, when the jury was not present.
it isn't a matter ~ ''
It's not testimony.
Q

So that

it*s not in the evidence in any event.

■.

But at no time did the petitioner ask the court

to ask the prosecutor to produce the witness?
MR. CARPENTER:

No.

But I think that they indicated

most strenuously their desire to have the witness present in
order to be questioned.
Q

No, I thought ----

MR. CARPENTER:
Q

Yes.

— well, maybe I misunderstood? but I understood

your record to show that they didn't want the trial to go on
without the witness? but they weren't particular whether fch
witness cams or not.
MR. CARPENTER:
that counsel used.

Now, I don't recall the exact wording

I got the impression from the statements

of counsel that —Q

That he made —

MR. CARPENTER:
Q

Yes.

~~ they wanted the witness there.

Well, couldn't it be that what they

wanted was that the trial not go on without the witness?
MR. CARPENTER:
Q

Which means no trial.

MR. CARPENTER:
Q

I think so.

Yes.

That * s what — well, don't you think they should

36
have asked what was going to be done about it?
Ml. CARPENTEFs

I think they might have asked, but

this remark that I've mentioned, which is in evidence, may have
been an explanation as to why they airin't.
to be there.
Q

They expected Holm

When, in the middle of the trial, -Well, don't you think that they could have

raised that point and told the court that?
MR, CARPENTER:
Q

Yes, they could have.

And don't you think they perhaps had an obliga­

tion to do that before trial so as not to have a second trial
aborted by a mistrial?
MR, CARPENTER:

Yes, if they had known that the

witness Holm was not going to be present —
Q

Well, you’re assuming something on which there

is nothing in the record, onevway or the other.
MR. CARPENTER: Well, the —
Q

You said if they had known.

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes.

>

q

We don't know from this record whether they did

or did not know.

For all we know, they may have been very

carefully making it a point not to make a demand.

It’s just as

good speculation as yours> that they avoided making a demand
because they never wanted to see Mr. Holm in the courtroom.
MR. CARPENTER: Well, this, of course, would be
devious tactics by some counsel, perhaps it might be suggested.

3?
Q

You wouldn't ™“

HR. CARPENTER:

I have quoted the entire passage in

the record,» which is not printed in the Appendix, where
counsel, before the testimony was offered, made their
objections.
Q

This was after the trial was once underway,

though.
MR. CARPENTER: This was after the trial was once
underway.
Q

So the only solution would have been a mistria

if they were going to •— probably a mistrial if they were
going to wait for this man to be subpoenaed and determine
whether he would honor an extraterritorial subpoena all the
way to Sweden.
MR. CARPENTERs
Q

Yes.

And then if a mistrial occurred, 1 suppose it

would be open tc the defense to claim that the mistrial was
the fault of the prosecution and that he could therefore
raise a double jeopardy defense.
MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, but 1 would say, then, — the

passage, the only passage that addresses — in the record,
that addresses itself to this point, is the statement by Mr.
Mitchell, on of Stubbs8 counsel at the second trial, and he
says, anci I quote —
Q

What page is that?

38
MR. CARPENTER:
at the bottom.

Page 16a of the respondent’s brief,

It's at page 162 of the transcript of the ’64

trial.
"Your Honor please, I think it is the law and it is
t he law until the courts speak otherwise.

Now, as Your Honor

recalls, Mr. Wooten" — who was the -prosecuting attorney —
"state that he would have Mr. Holmes" -- and Holm and Holmes
are interchangeable spellings of the same word — "present."
And then there’s three dots to show a suspension.
That’s the only passage in the record that speaks of
it.

Q

Was there another conviction besides the

Tennessee conviction?
MR. CARPENTER:
Q

In Texas or some place?

MR. CARPENTER:
Q

1 believe there was, yes.

Yes.

And New York specifically relied on the

Tennessee one?
MR. CARPENTER:
this case was concerned.
Q

Yes.

Yes.

They relied on it, so far as

MR. CARPENTER;
Q

When opposing certiorari —-

Could they have gotten the same mileage out of

the Texas conviction?
MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, X thought that the case might ha

moot because of that, and that the Court might not want to
consider the case.
Q

But, at any rate, New York —

Was that in the record?

Was that offered in

the record —• was the Texas conviction offered?

How do'

they prove a prior conviction in New York?
MR. CARPENTER: Well, they have, following a conviction
by the fact finder —
Q

Yes.

MR. CARPENTERS

— the prosecutor lays an informa­

tion.
Q

Yes.

MR. CARPENTER: And it is possible to have a jury
trial on the question whether the defendant is the same perron
that was convicted.

And .it’s also permissible under the

effective New York statute to raise questions as to whether
the previous conviction was constitutionally obtained.
Q

Now, that practice, that went forward hare?

MR. CARPENTER: This.went forward here, following his
conviction in Monroe County, and the only conviction that was
used was the Tennessee murder conviction.

Q

But how does anybody know

how did anybody

40
know there was a Texas conviction?
MR. CARPENTER: Well, following the mandate of the
court below.
Q

What about his testimony that he was on his way

from the Texas Penitentiary?

If he was on his way from the

Texas Penitentiary, he was either a guard 02: a prisoner.
MR. CARPENTER:
Q

Yes.

There's no —

Didn't he testify to that?

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes.

I don’t know whether this

would necessarily make him a felon, but my information is
that he was in fact convicted of a felony in Texas, a burglary.
Q

But there’s ■—

MR. CARPENTERS Whether or not it was a valid
conviction is still being litigated in the New York courts.
Q

His counsel is claiming, I suppose, that that

kind of conviction, too, was unconstitutional?
MR. CARPENTER:
Q

Yes.

In what proceeding is the Texas conviction

being made an issue?
MR. CARPENTERs Well, there was no stay of proceedings
following the decision below.

In this cas

Q

I checked on Friday

Have you been assigned throughout this hearing?

MR. CARPENTER:

I*vs been assigned in the court below,

and X — realising X had spent a thousand bucks — excuse me,
Your Honor; dollars — I asked the Clerk to assign me here
this morning, in order to proceed.
X think,- to return to the analysis of the case, it's
a. complicated case, and we 'nave to go from here to here to
discuss parts of it, not that --- the effect of one part on
the other part.
1 think that you don't, this Court does not need to
enter into the question ’as to whether or not there was
effective cross-examination, or whether there was harmless
error in the representation by counsel at the Tennessee trial.
If the Court determines that the prosecution in Tennessee had
to make an effort, some kind of an effort, to obtain the
presence of the witness Holm -0

Mr. Carpenter, at that point, —

MR. CARPENTER:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.

— enlighten me? what kind of an effort, in

your estimation, would be sufficient?
MR. CARPENTER:

I think the only effort that is

sufficient, where you have an indigent defendant is an offer­
to pay the expenses back, and an application.
Q

Why not a deposition?

X suggested —

Why not schedule: a

deposition in Sweden?
MR. CARPENTER:

Wall, if this is possible, I suppose

it would be

if the witness refused to corae but would attend

a deposition, this might be an effective substitute.
Q

But that would be expensive? too.

MS, CARPENTER:

This would mean you’d have to

transport more people over to Sweden than you would back, but
Q

Isn’t Justice Brennan’s comment appropriate?

Wouldn’t the defense then be complaining of expense, either
in going over to attend the deposition or in hiring local
counsel, and wouldn’t we have another case here?
MR. CARPENTER! Well, I don’t know’ that they — I
think, if you’re representing an indigent, counsel probably
would be more prudent than I was, and would go ahead and mala
the application before going over there, and would apply for
reimbursement.
But, maybe all that's necessary is, as was suggested
from the bench, just ask the witness if he's willing to come
back at his own expense.
Q

Well, suppose the witness, instead of being

in Sweden, were in the front lines in Vietnam; would that, make
any difference?
MR. CARPENTER:
— what is the case?

The question is — I’m thinking of

A case arose in California where

exactly the same situation occurred.

The application was

made to the Marine Corps, and the Legal Officer told the

police officer investigating that he was unavailable.

And it

was determined that this a satisfactory determination that the
witness was unavailable.
X think one of the California cases cited in the
brief for the —

No, it wasn't —

But at least you don't disagree with that

An answer came back that the witness was

This is a far cry from what was not done in this

case »
Q

And yet the military authority could have

ordered that man back into the United States, couldn't they?
MR. CARPENTERs

Yes.

The case that X was mentioning which is in the br:l e£
is the case, X think, People v. Benjamin, which is cited at
83 Cal. Rptr. 764? an intermediate appellate court, decision.
0

Mr. Carpenter, —

MR. CARPENTERS
Q

Yea, sir,

X take it you5 re relying on Barber v. Page

for your main proposition, and there is at least a factual
distinction between this case and Barber, isn't there, in that
in Barber nobody cross-examined on behalf of the particular
defendant who later raised the objection?

m. CARPENTER t

Q

Yes»

Whereas here there was cross-examination on

behalf of your client in the 1954 trial»
MR. CARPENTERs

Yes.

There was cross-examination.

Of course the decision in Barber expressly made the effective­
ness of the cross-examination not a factor in it. but — so
that the precis® holding in Barber, as I read the case, is that
assume you, have effective cross-examination, or assuming crossexamination is not an issue, that is, whether or not the
transcript that you're going to use ofthe absent witness's
testimony is a good enough transcript to use.
Q

Well, is it a holding, though, limited to the

*— when you're speaking of a holding, you3re talking about
the facts in a particular case.
MR. CARPENTER!

Yes,

And another factor that

distinguishes in harbar v. Page is that the distance was only
225 miles, and .it was — there was just one State line.

But

these factors — I don't think the distance here, it's 4509
miles or so to Sweden, is a determining factor.
Q

But, Mr. Carpenter, if there had been the moot

vigorous cross-examination of Mr. Holm, when he took the stand
in rebuttal, after Stubbs had told the good relations story,

&nd there had boro the most vigorous

MR. CARPENTER;

Q

x ry

»

1 would think that Barber v.

You still think that an effort should have

been mad® to have Mr. Holm appear at the second trial?
MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, Your Honor, because the right

of confrontation involves not merely cross-examination, but
also the right of a defendant to have his fact finder view
K

the witness, face-to-face, consider the demeanor of the
witness as he’s giving his testimony, and determine,. You
might have to waive this, give it up, because of the
necessities of some case. But it’s something that you shouldn8
give up easily.
Q

Well, suppose it appeared

.’ hypothetically

now, that’s not this ease — but suppose hypothetically it
appeared that defense counsel in that posture consulted
with his client and said, “You will be much better off to have
this testimony read.from the transcript than to have this men
sitting in the courtroom, flesh-and-blood, on the stand with
the scars of the ballet wounds on his face® ? and suppose he
mad© that decision, would you think anyone could reasonably
say that was ineffective, that tactic was ineffective
assistance of counsel?
MR. CARPENTER8 Why, I don't think ~
Q

Or was it a permissible choice?

MR. CARPENTERS

I think that perhaps it's possible

for counsel to make that decision»

1 don’t think it would be

dishonest for counsel to advise a client to "better let the
testimony b© read'5.
In this case there was no hope ---Q

Well, I’m not suggesting that it was dishonest,

I’m simply Suggesting that it might have bean sounder defense
tactics not to have Mr. Holm there.
MR. CARPENTER: The only defense tactics that would
I

have worked in this case, in my opinion, is to show Mr, Eol. .
to have been a liar,

That's the only way.

And counsel railed

to do anything effect in the *54 trial? they had no chance to
do it in the *64 trial.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MARIA L. MARCUS,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. MARCUS:
Q

Yes, sir.

Mrs. Marcus, what’s the status of this hearing

on the' Texas conviction?
MRS. MARCUS:

He’s been resentenced as a second

felony offender under the Texas predicate, and he is appealing
that Texas predicate.
Q

However, regardless of the outcome —

An appeal where, in the Hew York State court?

MRS. MARCUS:

In the Now York State court, yes.

48
Regardless of the out«
still would be no saootness in this case, because this Court
held in Sibron vs, —
Q

No, but isn’t the condition satisfied here?

The condition was that he be resentenced, wasn't it?
MRS. MARCUS?
Q

Yes, but —

Well, doesn’t that satisfy the condition of

this judgment?
MRS» MARCUSi

It does not, for the considerations

that this Court discussed in Sibron vs. New York, and the
Morgan case, the fact of collateral disabilities, and,
more important, under New York law, upon a subsequent coredotion the judge has the right to considor the whole history
of the defendant and the kind of crimes which he has
committed before, and has the discretion to sentence him to
a live sentence.
And of course -~
Q

Weil, what did he sentence him to here?

Is

it any different sentence that he got her©?
MRS, MARCUS % The sentence hero is not different, but,
as this Court pointed out in both Sibron and Morgan, the
it must be considered what would happen on a subsequent convic­
tion.

And what would happen in that the sentencing court would

undoubtedly regard as crucial in determining what kind of
person this is, what sort of chances for rehabilitation, and

49
what sort of clanger he, poses to the public in being released.
A brutal murder of this kind committed seven days after
release from the Texas Penitentiary would undoubtedly be
central to the sentencing court, and so, under the considera­
tions that this Court set out in Sibron and Morgan f the case
cannot be moot,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
