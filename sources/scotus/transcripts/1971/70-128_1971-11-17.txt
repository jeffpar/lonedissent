MR,- C3IIEF JUSTICE HJIGERj

Vfe'll hear arguments next

in ito» 128, Dies against Carter.
Mr. Morehead, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. I-K3REHEAD, ESQ.,

ON IMIAIff OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. MOEElEADs

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
My name is John 1'forehead, and I am here on beiialf of
tiie Danocratic Party of the State of Texas.
Shis case involves the constitutionality of political;,
party filing fees as an absolute prerequisite to getting on the
.Primary ballot.
This is an appeal from a duly constituted threejudge court.

The court below held that filing fees violate the

First Amendment and the due process clause and the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, when used eifciier as a revenuecollecting device of when made an absolute requirement in order
to get on the ballot.
There were intervenors in this case who desired to
vote for tie candidates who did not have the filing fees.
Judge Taylor, writing for the three-judge court, decided
that since the intervenors wanted to vote for these particular
candidates, that this was really

a voters' rights case, and that

therefore, in order for the State to sustain its laws, we had to

4
meet the burden of shaving a compelling State interest.
Our position is that the primary question before this
Court is whether or not the traditional rational relationships of
tiie Fourteenth Amendment applies to this factual situation, or
whether or not tie State must shew a compelling State interest.
in order to sustain its lavs,
'I'd begin with* let me say that I consider the issues
involved in a nominating primary for political parties to be
difference from those issues which are involved in a general,
election, •
The reasoning of Mr. Justice Stewart in Turner v.
Fouche

•— X tliink that’s the correct pronunciation

seems fee;

me to indicate that a filing fee as an absolute prerequisite
to stand for office in a general election would amount to
invidious discrimination,
Tlie first question to be decided here today is
whether or not the primary should be treated exactly like a
general election,,
There is language in a 1944 case* Smith v, Allwxighfa*
which Mr. Justice Marshall is very familiar with* vh:,ch indicates
tint the answer to my question is yes.
Reed said;

In Smith* Mr. Justice

when primaries become a part of the machinery for

choosing officials* State and national* as they have here* the
same test to determine the character of discrimination

.as

abridgement should be applied bo the primary as are applied to

5
the general election»
The Court in Smith was talk;4 -re-jl :•»<«*-- -ate ns»

wMdh fenced off the rights of otherwise qualified blade voters
to participate in a Democratic Primary*

Since the decision of

this Court in Smith*-, many cases have come before this Ccurt,
which involve both voter rights and candidate rights*

The

issues and problems have been defirdtionally refined, to the
extent that I tiiink that if Smith ware to cone before this Court
today, I believe that the Court would probably, would obviously
reach, 'die seme result, but would probably use a little bit
different wording than was used in Smith.»
I feel that it would be much more similar to -'*■ for
example, the case of Kramer_vs. Unicai Free School District.
In order to get an accurate perspective of the issues
in tlds ca.se, a brief sketch of how Texas elections systems work
will ba helpful to the Court,
The primaries are held in May, and under the laws that
exist today the payment of the fee is an absolute requirement
to get on the ballot.

No write-ins at all are permitted on the

primary ballot.
In Hovei’ber the election is free, no fees are charged
at all .in the State of Texas»
Q

hho is eligible to vote in a primary election?

MR, MOREHEADs

Everyone,

You can only vote in either

—» there’s a law that says you can only tote in the Democratic

6
Primary or in the Republican Primary, but a3.1 qualified voters
are eligible to vote
Q

in the primary elections,

In one or the other of them?

MR, I-0?EHSADs
Ci

'that's right.

They don't have to siaow anything about their party

affiliation?
MR. £OREH£ADs

No, sir? they do not*

At the top of the ballot is printed the words Which

say tiiat "I pledge 'to support the nominees'’ , but of course no
way that that could ever be enforced.
And also in our November election we have a much,
much easier method for independent candidates or independent
parties to get on the ballot than the Court was faced with in
the recent case of Jenness y, Fcrtscn.
There this Court held that five percent was all right.
In Texas it's one percent of the people for a Statewide election
aid fee: local elections it's also one percent, except there's an
absolute maximum.

You can't ever have to have more than 500

signatures in older to get on the November ballot.

And so, as the

Court is aware, this is a consolidated case involving three
different candidates who desired, to get on the election.

The

two local candidates, the one for County Judge in Fort Worth
and the one for County Camdssioner out in El Paso, both of which
counties have population .in excess of 300,000 people? only needed
500 people on the petition in order to get on the November ballot.

7
Vte think tliat a primary

Q

Any — excuse me — any other substantial limit*-

tions or reguirenents with respect to the getting
petition.

on the ballot by

Do the signers have to be people who have not vc-iid

in

either primary, for example?
MR. tDREUEADs

No.

No.

They just get one percent of

the people that fonu to support an independent candidate.

Q

And by one percent of the people you mean one

percent of the eligible voters?
MR„ M3REHEAD:

One percent of the eligible voters»

not one percent of the people that voted in trie last election;
but one percent of the eligible voters.
Now, the State thinks that a political primary is
an extension of the right to vote, similar to which this Court
was faced in the

McDonald

case, involving the absentee ballot

for the inmates of the Cook County prison.
In a primary you get to vote a second time.

Not

only do you get to vote in November, but you also get an oppor­
tunity to vote in May, and we therefore submit tliat this is an
extension, end that also you can see the candidate gets 'the
right to run twice.

For example, Mayor Lindsay lost in the

Republican Primary, for Mayor of New York, and was able to eorae
back as an Independent in November, and still win the election.
<•

Vte submit that the footnote in 3raigrr<y«Psl-CrKC-a-Kranfer by Mr, Chief
■justice hfarren, which points out the distinction between a fencing-

8

off case, as happened in Kramer, where the man wasn't eligible to
vote at all, and the type of case that you have in -McDonald, which
is an extension of the voting rights, is a distinction which this
Court should apply in this case*
Md that the three-judge court, when they applied the
rational relation test — I mean when they applied tlie canpellincr
State .interest test to the laws of the State of Terar.they just
simply used the 'wrong test,
And that, 'therefore, if it were not for the press
of tire fact that we have new primaries coming up in 1972 and
new deadlines to meet, that the proper disposition of this
case is really a remand to toe three-judge court to apply toe
proper test to tlie Texas laws.
Vfe submit, of course., that the rational relation
test is the one which this Court should use»
Stow, even applying the rational relations test, we
are still faced with the problem of s does this filing fee, as
an absolute requirement to get on the primary ballot, which is
a part of toe election process, constitute .invidious discrimina­
tion?
If the rational relation test applies, then we
submit that the Court could lode — should look to the other
side of toe question and what purposes does the. fee serve.
Tlie fee serves too purposes to tlie State ofjTexass
!.

first, it serves tlie pu.ri.JOse of regulating the ballot? rnd,

9
secondly, it serves the purpose of financing the actual cost of
the election itself.

In other words, the candidates pay ail

tie cost of printing up the ballots, paying the voting officials,
all of the other incidental things, renting a place, we use the
public schools most of the time to hold the elections in, give
them the pencils, renting the voting machines from "die county,
and all of these matters.

This is taxed to the candidates and.

not to the States.
On ilie face of this, both of these reasons would
appear legitimate, but we still must look to the question cl.
whether they have the effect of classifying and effectually
excluding from the electoral procsss people who are unable to
pay the fee.
Q

Mr. Morshead, why wouldn’t you do iiiat on

the general election, then, too?
MR. MORUIIEADs

I5m sorry, I don’t understand the

question.
hi

Why wouldn’t you split the cost of the general'
l

election among the candidates who are can the ballot at the
general election?
MR. MOREHEADs

To me, inherent in our Const!”

tuticn, botli the United States Constitution and the State
Constitutiar-., we have an elective process; that’s the way we
select our public officials is through election.

The ul'

election, since that’s the way we’re going to run our govemaient,

it seems to be must be bem:;, the

cost, of that must be borne

by the state, and that someone who is Triable to pay the fee
there, ;4r» Justice, obviously must have the cjpartunity to
stand for ultimate election.

And it.might be a legitimate

purpose to help finance it that way, but you certainly could
not exclude someone from a general election in November because
of ids inability to pay this fee.
Q

Well, all l*m saying is, isn't your argons

equally applicable to the primary?

How do you differentiate

between the primary and the general election?

When you argue

•tids way, arid in addition you say that the primary is an
extension of the general,
MR»MCX?EHEAD:

Well, it seams to me that you first

need to look, historically at the problem of the priraaries.
The primaries weren't there when we first started to hold
elections in this country, and, as I understand it, sane States
still naninate through convention, as opposed to through
primaries.
And the fact that someone is unable to get on the
ballot in the primary election doesn't necessarily mean that Ire
can't get elected? whereas., if he's unable to get on the ballot
in November, he's —- tiie door is closed, he's foreclosed from
any possibility of

for election.

Does that respond, sir?
Q

That's the response 1 have.

fell, it's the only one I can think of, too.

.fed I just waadered what you -~*
Wall, I've teen thinking on '■
problem a considerable bit of time.
Q

If the costs were of groat concern, I

suppose the cost of the general election is substant; .ally
more than the cost of the primar
MR* tOSUEADs
sir.

f so?

In terms of total cost, it’s not,

The reason being that in. Texas vra hold two primary

elections and only one general election, . and therefore you5ye
got to lave too sets of officials, and — if you’re going to
bold them in. different places — and t«o sets of ballot
boxes, for example, or two sets of voting machines? whereas,
in the general election you. only have to hold one of these.
One of the problems which I tliink needs to be
considered is the rational relation test does apply, or what
are the alternatives?
Q

Well, what was the District Court's excuse

for applying a more strict test? Did it base its holding; bn
the First .Amendment?
MR. MOM&EAQ:
Q

Yes, sir„

Do you challenge the holding- that the First

Amendment is relevant to — it protects the right to run for
a State office?
MR. IOREUEAD: Wot the ultimate right to run, no,
sir, I don’t think — I mean I do think the First Amendment doe

12
protect the ultimata right -bo ran for Stats office.
Q

Are there cases like that here?

MR. tDREHEAD;
an abstract proposition.

Not that I have sevo, but it!s fast

iaaajnifcies clausa would get. the First Amendrvant bade ir, at id apyf ■

If I*iu saying that correctly*

Vhafc the three~judge court based their reasoning
on, sir, was this:
Q

They said that —
Well, I can understand why they did it if

they thought the First Amendment was involved.
MR. MOFEHEAD:

Right.

They said that this was a

voter right question, since voters wanted to vote for a
particular candidate# that# therefore, this was a voter question
and not a candidate question and that# therefore# the right to
speak and vote —*
Q

I would have thought that it probably

Tfc federal right to vote# under the First

Atnerjdnenfc# in a State election?
MR. MOREHEADs

I just would have to be frank and say

that I don't know the answer to that question.

On first blush#

I would think so# but I must plead ignorance to that.

in other words, you

have to show seme sort of modicum of support in order fco get on
the primary ballot because, otherwise, you. face the very real
problem of 500 people filing for the offive of Governor of the
State of Texas»

It’s not. quite the same problem as Mr* Justice

Blade said in Williams v. KS^ylgs,

There he talked about the

theoretical possibility of the proliferation — If I can get all
■those words right — of political parties.

Mid I

think that the theoretical possibility of

proliferation of candidates is a much more real problem than the
possibility of having a whole lot of political parties»
Q

Other States handle this problem wither'.;

MR. MOKSI-EADs
Q

Yes, sir; they do.

Ey requiring a certain number of signatures

on a petition or by —
MR. MOREHEAD;

Seme do it by petition, others have

just not ever met the problem..

The most serious situation, I

think, arose in the State of Michigan one time, where they did

end

up with 700 people on a primary ballot.
Q

These fees can go up to close to $9,000.

MR. MORSHEAD:

Yes, sir, they certainly can.

It’s

expensive to hold an election.

of this fee they set, I think you'd have gotten sons redress in
the courts of the State of Texas on that matter.
Q

Well, on that matter, ultimately they just paid

the actual costs?
MR. frX)REHEM>j

That's right.

Ultimately they just

paid the actual cost, and ultimately all of them divided on the
amount of payment made.

(Laughter.)
Rut that's the basic fee.

has to pay a $50 filing fee, and then later on, after you find

after tilt'; filing deadline, is

and so therefore the cost to run for a Statewide office scr-fxx
seems to be less than it does to .tun for the ethers.

And counsel

for Mr. Pate has said that this is a discrimination in itself.
They charge $150 to run for the state Legislature# $1,000 to run
for Governor.

That's the roaidnum for a Statewide office, $1,000.
And that goes to the —

Is there any accounting required by the —

MR. PDRSKEAD;
Q

Tliat goes into 'the Party cost.

Right.

The receipts and expenditures.

MR. MOHSHEAD:

Right,

18
The other alternative that I would like to pose
before I sit down is, if the candidates don’t finance these
party primaries, who must finance it?

The other alternative

is that of course you need make the counties and the State
itself finance these particular elections.

And to say that

the States must themselves finance it, and that that’s part of
equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment is quite a
different thing, as saying that the Legislature can finance it
itself if it so desires.
In other words, to say that the State must finance it
is to say that somewhere in the equal protection clause there
is some sort of affirmative language which say3 that the St-tvmust act, that the State must hold this primary election, antfinance it themselves.

Because I think that ultimately,

whether it's a $50 filing fee or a five-cenfc filing fee or a
$9,000 filing fee, that the filing fee itself, because you're
always going to run into that one person or that group of
people, that the $50 is just as important to as

or the

$5 would be just as important, or as Mr. Justice Douglas said
in Harper, that the $1.75 on the Virginia poll tax doesn't
really any valid relation to the man's ability and right and
qualifications to stand for office, or to vote for that
particular matter.
Q

Do you understand, Mr. Morehead, that the District

Court held that these, first of all, that these fees are

unconstitutional only as applied to people who could not
afford to pay them?
MR, MO REHEAD:

No, sir.

In their opinion, the

court said that it's unconstitutional in two respects:

No. I,

it cannot be used — they use the words f "revenue-raising
device".

It's not a revenue-raising device in the senes that

it goes into ’the State coffers like the poll tax used to.
Q

It's to pay the cost.

MR, MOREHEAD:

It's to pay the cost of it.

They said

you could not use filing fees to pay the cost of the election.
And, No, 2, they said it could not be made an absolute require­
ment to get on the ballot.
Q

Well, by the use of that word "absolute", do

you think they implied that a person who could afford this
fee could be required to pay it, but somebody who —
MR. MOREHEAD:
q

Filed a — excuse me.

— couldn't afford -the fee could file in

indigency?
MR. MOREHEAD:
Q

I read it that way, yes.

And on —

MR. MORGUEAD:

But, on the other hand

when you sea

the requirement that our State Legislature put on the affidavit
of indigency in their last legislative session, that's obviously
got to be bad.
Q

I mean they —
Mr, Morehead, I have difficulty with your answer

20
to Mr. Justice Stewart*

You said to Mr-

that the concluding paragraph of the opinion seems to rest
this squarely on First Amendment grounds, without reference to
any equal protection or other basis for the decision,

Am I

wrong about that?

Mow, he says in the second

We have limited our decision here to say that a

filing fee violates the First Amendment and the due process
clause and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment when it is used as a revenue-collecting device
that's what I thought the court really held.
Q

I see.

And this last paragraph says:

In

granting declaratory relief, there’s no difference.
Certainly the last paragraph rests, does it not,
squarely on the First Amendment?
MR. MOREHEAD:

Yes, sir.

And squarely on the voting

rights problem as opposed to -the candidate problem.
Q

And if it rested, on page 10a, on the First

Amendment and equal protection, it doesn’t help very much
that the equal protection is also added, if the payment, of a

fee violates the First Amendment.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE WISCHKAEMPER
MR. CROUCH;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
I would like to point out that the background of the
filing fee is that it was designed, along with the poll tax,
to exclude blacks from the party primaries in Texas.

The

poll tax was adopted into the State Constitution in 1902, and
the filing fee was adopted by the Legislature in 1911.
In United. States_vs. ...Texas , Judge Thornberry said
that one of the main purposes of the poll tax was to dis­
enfranchise the Negro voter.

And we maintain that the purpose

of the filing fee was to finance these white primaries,
which have been to the Supreme Court of the United States five
different times.

23
Now , -the very fact that words indicating race are
not mentioned in the statute doei i
in the picture, because the very act of adopting an economic
status standard for a person who seeks elective office is
automatically placing a race standard in effect.
Q

Well, are you arguing a different basis for

sustaining the judgment below than the court used?
MR. CROUCHs
Q

No, Your Honor, --

1 would think you shouldn't do that, but I

just wondered.
MR. CROUCHs

I pointed out in my brief that the

filing fees tend to keep indigents from filing.
Q

Now, this is an equal protection argument?

MR. CROUCHs

Yes.

But it also — when you talk

about indigeirits, you're talking more about minority parties
than you are whites, and you're talking more about women
than you are men.
I have some tables in my brief to illustrate that.
Now, in Texas, in addition to the blacks, we have
the browns, and Mr* Morehead pointed out that it's fairly
easy to gat on the election ballot in the general election
as a write-in candidate.
Well, in the brief filed from El Paso, there is a
table over in the back showing write-in candidates in November
1970 general election, the last page, 86, and there were 398

24
write-in votes.
So that is an exercise in futility to attempt to get
on the general election ballot as a write-in candidato.
Q

I think Mr, Morehead was not talking about

write-in votes at a general election,- but getting your ness
on ■the ballot in the general election —
MR. CROUCH:
Q

Yes, sir.

— by a nominating petition of one percent.

MR. CROUCH:

That's as a third party.

And a

group attempted that last year, called "La Rossa de Maltha"(?)
and the Supreme Court of Texas turned them down over a
technicalxfcy *
Q

What was the technicality?

MR. CROUCH:
Q

Yes.

And a dissenting ™— sir?

What was the technicality, that they had less

than one percent?
MR. CROUCH;

Mo.

They apparently had enough per­

centages, and at least one or two counties.

They were trying

to get on in five counties, if I remember correctly.
There was a dissenting opinion which indicated that
this group was acting in good faith, but they had conflicting
opinions of what the statute meant from two or three different
State officials, and nobody understood what 'the statute was.
And so they were not allowed on the ballot.
Q

But, in any event, Mr. Morehead was not talking

25
• about write-in. votes at a general election, but was talking
about a man8s ability, or,, as you say, inability to get his
name on the ballot at the general election —
MR. CROUCH;

Right»

In the- third-party column.
X

All right, now, bringing that down to the county
level, he mentioned the figure of 500 signatures as a maximum.
That’s true.

But since this case has been decided, the

Legislature of Texas has done a remarkable plastic surgery job
on the face of the statute»

They've enacted what's called

House Bill 5.
And I'm not sure when the bandages come off, but I
think January the 1st.
In that: particular House Bill 5, the requirement to
get on as a write-in candidate is ten percent of the people who
voted for Governor in your party at the last general election,
which, in Tarrant County, would be 6,211 signatures.
they have to be sworn to before a notary.

And

And the notary in

Texas is entitled to a 50-cent statutory fee, which would
mean over $3,000 just in notary fees to get the signatures.
How, that's not 500, which is all it requires to get
on as a third-party candidate? but over 6,000 to get into the
Democratic Primary as a write-in candidate.
And in addition to that, you have to sign and swear
to a pauper's oath, and humiliate and degrade yourself fay
helping to establish and perpetuate a caste system.

I don't

26

see any need for that, but there it is.
Q

There is legislation, conditional legislation

enacted by the State Legislature which comes into effect
depending upon the result of this issue —
MR. CROUCHI
Q

— by this Court?

MR. CROUCH:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

Is that set out in full somewhere?

I saw it

was referred to.
MR. CROUCH:

Yes, it's attached as an exhibit in

the State's brief.
Q

In the State's brief?

MR. CROUCH;

Yes, sir.

Now, it's also a temporary measure that expires at
the end of 1972, so nobody really knows what it means.
Now, with reference to Mr. Morehead's statement about
two sets of voting officials.

The Secretary of State himself,

who is the chief election officer for the State of Texas, has
recommended in a message to the last Legislature that a unitary
primary system be established and that it be paid for out of
tax funds by the county and by the State.
tod so we would eliminate some of the cost of having
the duplicating primaries, if that recommendation is followed.
Now, I maintain, and I have all througi%ut, that
the filing fee is a poll tax imposed on a citizen who wants to

27
run for office and vote for himself „
How, in Texas, you have what is called a coot deposit
of $50 for a person who wants to run for county office.

He

pays that at the same time that he files his application to
run.
Then, after th© executive committee has had a chance
to meet and make the party assessments, he has to

at that

time he has to ante up additional sums of money running up into
several thousand dollars.
This last year in Tarrant County th© filing fee
assessed by -felt© executive committee of the party was 32 percent
of the annual salary, which is a very large sum of money«
And, as Mr. Morehead pointed out, of the 23 Tarrant County
officials on the primary ballot in the Democratic Primary
last year, only two of them had opponents because of these
high filing fees.
And of the total of over $200,000 received by the
chairman /of the Tarrant County Democratic Party in. 1970, 77
percent of that money came from the incumbents themselves.
There was nobody els© who could afford to pay, and it's outside
of the record; but of course many of them found difficulty in
paying it, too.
Q

Do you understand the holding of the District

Court in this case to have been that these fees are
unconstitutional only as applied to those who cannot afford to

20
pay them?
MR. CROUCH:

I think not.

unconstitutional to everybody.

1 think they ara

Sven as the poll tax is

unconstitutional to everybody.
tod with reference to the poll tax once more, X would
like to remind the Court of Harman ve„ yorsa&nfrs.

In that

case, it was a Virginia case, the Twenty-fourth amendment had
been adopted outlawing the poll tax in federal elections, and
the State of Virginia, to gat around this ruling, passed a
statute that made it possible for anybody who wanted to avoid
the payment of a poll tax to file an affidavit instead,

tod

the affidavit testified that the person had been a resident
for so many months and that he intended to remain a resident
throughout — until the election was over.
How, you see, in our case we have Harman vs. Fprssanlvm
all over again, except instead of one affidavit we have to file
6100 affidavits,

tod X think that’s 6100 times as bad as

Harman vs.JForssen.lun.

Of course,- I'm prejudiced in the

matter, because I've represented these people who just flat
have not been able to pay the filing fees that have bean
demanded.'

Q

Well, so your clients, as I understood you, size

people who cannot afford to pay this?
MR. CROUCHs That’s right,
by the other side.

tod it, was so stipulated

There were three different plaintiffs in the case,
Q

And all the plaintiffs in this case, —

MR. CROUCHs Right.
Q

— in these three consolidated cases, were

people who alleged that they could not afford to pay the fee;
is that correct?
MR. CROUCH; That’s right.

Two of then are law

students, incidentally.
0

So that I wondered how you understood the court’

decision, just that the fees are unconstitutional only as
applied to those in your clients’ position?
MR, CROUCH:
Q

As applied to everybody?

MR. CROUCH;
Q

No, sir; as applied to all,

That’s my understanding, yes.

So you further understand the court to have

held -that all fees would be unconstitutional, even a ona-dollar
fee?
MR. CROUCH;
narrow fee.

Well, there is the question of a low and

There’s some sort of hesitation on the part of

Judge Thornberry, if I remember correctly, and he was
concerned about the Weatherington case over in Florida, which
held that reasonable filing fees may be constitutional.

And

I think he was trying to take that ruling into account, when
he said that possibly a low and narrow fee might be constitu­
tional.

He didn’t say it was.

30

Q

He didn't write the opinion, did he?

MR, CROUCH;
Q

Sir?

He wrote the concurring opinion,

Oh.

But the court's opinion doesn't talk about that,
dees it?
MR. CROUCH;

Ho, sir.

tod the Court asked a while

ago about — was there any First amendment case other than
ours, and the Duncanfcell case, which was decided in Houston on
October the 27th, specifically says that the right to run for
elective office is inextricably woven into the fabric of the
First Amendment.
And one of ray co-counsel here has pointed out to me
that Williams vs. Rhodes also was decided on the basis of the
First Amendment.
But it would seem to me that the First Amendment is
ranch more important in this particular —* pardon me.
Q

Williams didn't -- I might suggest Williams v.

Rhodos talked about the right to associate.
MR. CROUCH;
Q

Right.

But it didn’t put the right to vote on the First

Amendment.
MR. CROUCHx

Well, the right to associate is a part

of the First Amendment.
Q

2 agree with that, yes.

0

Incidentally, I notice at page 161 of the record

31
•the judgment of the throe-judge court makes it explicit that
the section was declared unconstitutional, and its enforcement
enjoined, 1 gather as to everybody? and that the declaration of
unconstitutional!fcy is rested only on, because they infringe
upon First Amendment rights without any compelling justification
in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments,

Is

that right?
MR,, CROUCH %
Q

Yes, sir.

So I gather, at least on the face of the

judgment that was entered hare,'it rested on the First
Amendment -« correct?
MR. CROUCHs
0

Yes, sir.

And secondly, it enjoins its enforcement as to

everybody, not merely as to your impecunious clients.

Is that

right?
MR. CROUCHs That's right.

The whole State of Texas

and the political parties are all enjoined.
Now, with reference to the standard to be employed.
As I understand it, there are three different standards that
can be employed. The first is whether or not the articulated
State goal can be accomplished in some less drastic means
than the one employed by the State.
And under Kramer that question needs to be answered
first before you go into the question of whether you apply
the compelling justifications test or the rational interests

O£

test.
And 1 take the position that there is another less
drastic way of regulating the ballot in nominating petitions#
and -there are 34 offices included on the Tarrant County
ballot in 1970# which is given in one of the exhibits in my
brief# and 21 of those offices "could come off the ballot if
we had legislation permitting single-member legislative
districts and single-member judicial districts for Tarrant

County.
That, coupled with the nominating petition# 1 think
would be a less drastic means than a filing fee to regulate
the ballot.
But coming back to Harper, the Harper claim they
say is that any fee is par se unconstitutional because it's
irrelevant, the man’s economic status has no relevancy
whatsoever to his qualifications as a write-in.
And Mr. Mcrehead pointed out the case from Georgia,
the Turner vs. Fouche case.

He mistakenly said that that

involved a filing fee, when actually it did not? it required
an ownership of real property.
But 1 think that the ownership of real property is
equivalent to the ownership of personal property, except in
Texas the State takes the personal property and the State of
Georgia allowed the man to keep his one square inch of real.
property.

33
Shelton vs. jpudcor# "the breadth of legislative
abridgement must•be reviewed in the light of less drastic
means for achieving the same basic purpose.”
Williams vs, Illinois,
Circuit opinion concurring:

Mr. Justice Harlan# in a

"The matris: of recent equal

protection analysis is that the rule of statutory classifica­
tions which either are based upon certain suspect criteria or
affect fundamental rights will be held to deny equal protection
unless justified by a compelling government interest”, citing
Shapiro# Harper# and Williams.
And in this case w© not airly have the fundamental
constitutional right to run for elective.office? but its
concomitant the fundamental constitutional right to vote for
the candidate who wants to run? and in addition to those two
fundamental constitutional rights which are involved# we have
also this suspect legislative criterion of poverty.
We have tha filing fee which limits the place on the
ballot to the man with money.

And, this means that his economic

status has become a qualification for office# and all of the
three offices involved here are offices where the qualifications
are set by the Constitution of the State.
And it's beyond the power of the State Legislature
to amend -the Constitution of the State and pass additional
requirements.

And economic status is absolutely irrelevant.

The Edwards case held this.

Recently the Graham case

34
has held it»

And in the Graham case? if S remember the case

correctly, there was a case involving aliens, and the court
said that an alien had this right regardless of ids nationality
to welfare benefits# and it was very important that he should
have it.
In our case we're not representing aliens, we're
representing American citizens, and American citizens who are
not asking for a handout, they're not asking to go on the
welfare rolls, they don't have any money but they're asking
for a job, they're asking for a right to b© considered for
elective office? which# under Turner vs. Fouche, I think they
have a basic fundamental right to be considered for elective
office without -these other qualifications which are
absolutely unconstitutional.
Q

I notice in Judge Thornberry's concurring opinion

that he says, among other tilings, "voters are deprived of the
opportunity to have their candidate considered for the
Democratic Party nomination if he cannot post the filing fee13,
and he goes on, "Since in the overwhelming majority of Tessah
political offices nomination by the Democratic Party is tanta­
mount to election, it is clear that restriction on entry into
the primary may significantly impair the right to cast one’s
vote effectively", and so on.
"And they are precluded by the high filing fee from
associating within the established .party."

m. CROUCHs That's right.
Q

Doss this imply that this law is only applicabis

to the Democratic Party and; not the Republican Party?
MR, CROUCHS

Ho, sir.

The opinion there says that

the political parties, plural, of the State are ®njoined.
But let me point out that in my candidates5 particular
race there were no Republican candidates at all*

If I

remember correctly, there war© only «*- the candidates in
Tarrant County, Texas, only fielded candidates in four races,
four County races out of 30-some-odd.

Q

That is the Republican Party did?

MR. CROUCHs That's right,
Q

Do they hold a primary, or do they do it by

convention?
MR, CROUCH % Well, they hold one.

If a party gets a

certain number of votes in the Hovesjnber election, they have
to hold a primary.

But the Republican Party is not able to,

collect these filing fees, because their nomination really
isn’t worth an awful lot, and they have to use volunteer help
at the polls, whereas the worker® in the Democratic Primary
are paid two dollars an hour-:.
Q

of the filing fees.

So the Republican Pasty doesn't require these

fees?
MR.CROUCHs

Tgs, they have fees. But quite frequently

they return the fees and don't use them,

But mostly they try

to use volunteer help,

ted quite frequently they don't us© the

voting machines * because the paper ballots are cheaper*
There8s a newspaper•clipping from the Dallas Morning
N&ga in the. El Paso brief, which I'd like to refer the Court
to,explaining the problems with reference to the Republic
Party,
But if the Secretary of State's reoonraendations to —
q

Senator Tower didn't have toe much trouble,

did he'?
MR. CROUCH %
Q

Pardon?

Senator Tower didn't have too much trouble,

did he?
MR*CROUCHs

Well now, this was a Statewide race.

The Republicans are able to win Statewide

q

y©s, but I mean you complain that there's only

one party down there.
MR., CROUCHs Except in Statewide races.
But if the filing fees go. out, and the recommendations
of the Secretary of Stats are followed by the Legislature,
and we have a unitary primary, then we would have greater
participation on the part of all? because everybody will go
to the same place to vote, just as in November.

The Republicans

will go to this machine over here, and the Democrats over here.
And it will all bo paid for out of tax funds.
Q

And this will be done if what?

MR. CROUCHn

If the recommendations o:t the Secretary

of State, who’s on the other .side of this lawsuit, are carried
out.
Q

Is that in the form of a bill now before the

Legislature?
MR. CROUCH?

It was a message, a special message, and

it’s included as pm exhibit in the El Paso brief.

Mid we

heartily concur with his recommendations.
Q

Mr. Crouch, X*m a little confused.

Is there

any division of opinion among the State office holders cf
Texas on this suit?
MR. CROUCHs
Q

Well, certainly.

Some are on one side, some on the other, are

they not?
MR. CROUCH: Well, nobody has intervened on our sick;.
To be perfectly frank about it, it’s not politically
expedient for an. office holder to become involved in a
controversy of this nature.

that it applies to everyone whether he can afford to pay or

MR. CALAMIA:
Q

The reason *—

No one can be required to pay a fee?

MR. CALAMXA:

• Well, the reasoning, Mr. Chief Justice,

is what I disagree with, and that it limited it only on First.
Amendment rights is what I’m saying.
My-position is that the right to run for office is
as much a fundamental right as the right to vote, under the
First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which
guarantees political association, and that that right should not
ba impinged upon.
That is my position, and I think that if that is
followed it would eliminate exactly what is happening in
Texas under -tills system? and that is a monopoly in government
itself is what exists down there.
There’s a monopoly because it is a government by the
selected, for the selected and of the selected.

And I submit

to the Court that the crux of the issue is whether the
classification here, which limits the right to vote or
seek public office as a candidate, is per se unconstitutional
under the First Amendment, which is the right to freedom of
political association and equal protection that candidates —

rights,
This was

like in Rhodes, there there was a

discrimination between parties, and in that case, as Justice
White inquired;

Is there a case from tills Court that talks

about First Amendment rights in connection with the right to
run for office?
And it did.

That’s the case where they talk about

First Amendment rights as a right to run for office.
Now? I agree that the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment permits the States to make classifications
and it does not require them to treat them uniformly;
nevertheless, it bans any invidious discrimination.

The primary election is an organ of the State and,
as stated in that case by ~~ in the Allwrlght case, when
primaries become a part of the machinery for choosing officials,
State and national, as they have there, the same test to deter™

as are applied to the general election.
The general election, Your Honors, and Mr.. Chief
Justice, merely confirmed hha discrimination that exists in
the primaries.

And the alternate about petition for

We nay there’s

We say there's First Amendment

rights violated, the right to political association, from the
voters' standpoint and from the candidates’ standpoint.
And we also say that the classification is in that
nature or neighborhood or criterion which is suspects

money.

It doesn't even say wealth or property? it says
money? cash.

And when that is involved, then this Court -oust,

under its test, give it a careful scrutinising examination
and the: State must show a necessary compelling interest forhaving such classification.
I dote81 think they can do

I think they say in their

brief, if that's true the ballgame is over,

1 say the ballgame

is over arid it's time to change.
And just briefly, interjecting House Bill 5 in here,
which was not in issue, 2*m going to ask this Court if it would.

if and when it makes its decision# to make it sc broad that
it5s in favor of the appellees that we won't have to be coming
up to this Court time and time again for relief# like we’
done when they were trying to keep the black people fro:::
running in the Democratic Primaries, where five separata suits,
one right after the other, had to be brought because Texas
doesn’t, give up that easy.
I submit to the Court that this is a suspect
classification, the compelling interest test applies.

I

further submit that -the excuses and reasons that they give for
this legislation are totally irrelevant to the .achievement of
the State*s objective, that'is of keeping the — they say c
will result.

They say the ballots will be cluttered with a

lot of non-serious and spurious candidates.

That’s speculative.

That’s remote.
The other States have worked that out, and the Statedcan do it the same way.

How?

By a modicum of support

petitions and not to couple it with alternativess

that one can

pay *—■ one candidate can pay a fee and -the other one can get
a petition to show modicum of support.

That's again violating

the equal protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment.
So I respectfully submit to the Court that if we are
to envision the two concepts of government of the people, by
and for the people, that the opinion of the lower court be
broadened; affirmed but broadened on the First Amendment rights

44
and -the equal protection rights.
That is, as to candidates , 'they have a right under the
First Amendment to run for office, as long as they possess all
other qualifications and there is shown a modicum of support
for them,
I believe that’s all I have to state.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.
•?

Thank you.

Mr. Bailey.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAT BAILEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BAXLEY?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to say initially, in rebuttal, a comment
or statement made in one of the briars filed by the appellees;
tiie statement says, "Texas, you finance your great universities,
your schools, your tremendous highway system? why do you fight
the financing of the most essential duty of government, when
you know that the primary ©lections, for the most part, are
tantamount to election?”
I think, that this is one of -Urie issues that comes up
in this case, because what, in effect, the trial court, the
three-judge court below has done is to completely do away with
the financing system in Texas that we have for all of our
election process, with the exception of the general election.
They have, in effect, said Texas can raise the revenue or can.

45
take care of it through some source.
Really, what in effect the court has dona is to say
that the State of Texas or lesser political subdivision in the
State will now have to take over this function, since the
political parties that wish to submit nominees for election on
the general ballot are now doing it, so, in. effect, forcing
the State to expend moneys, to allocate their limited tax funds*
or the local taxing

bodies, limited to another project which,

I think as yon. can see by the statement that they are rather
expensive at times.
Now, this case really started out, I think it’s kind
of moved around and jumbled around a little bit, where it's
really hard to see what we really have.

It really started

out with some particular candidates who did not have, they
thought, adequate funds to pay the filing fees, challenging the
right of this.
During the course of this case, certain voters
intervened that said that "I'd like to vote for a particular
one of these candidates".

And actually what the court finally

decided this case on was not the rights of the candidates here
as to whether or not they had a right to bs on the ballot
without paying some sort of filing fee, foot what tin •
that you’ve infringed upon some voting-right principle of the
voters.
Now, I think what you do here is that when we start

talking abeat these voting-right principles, we start talking
about compelling interest*:, and this is ™- again the court said
that there is no compelling interest for the State to have
allowed this type of situation in this particular case.
Well, I submit, in this connection, that possibly
the court had used the wrong test in this case.

They used

one of these voting-principle cases to decide whether these
fees

— was there any compelling interest to the State for

these filing fees?
Q

Mr. Bailey, could you charge for running in the

general election?
MR. BAILEYs
Q

They do not. Your Honor.

I say, could the State of Texas constitutionally

do it?
MR. BAILEY;

I think, Your Honor, that — you would

have a bigger problem there, or v/ould have one if you just made
a charge. And I think this — maybe it's tied in with what the
court below said. They said that, having a filing fee —
Q

But if you use the exact same filing fee in the

general election, would that be constitutionally permissible?
MR. BAILEY;

I don't know. Your Honor,that

think — well, I'll put. it like this:
maybe it would.

— I

I think that possibly,

I think that one that was based on cost, of

the election process would certainly be in a better situation
than one, as -the court below mentioned. They said a. small or

reasonable — they talk about e reasonable type of filing fee,
as if some lwer filing £e© would be constitutionally acceptable.
They said it would be permissible, it would be a legitimate,
possibly even compelling function of the State.
I think what happens here is that —
So is it your answer -that it might be?

Q

MR. BAILEYs

I think that if you, put some type of

filing fee on the general election —
The same fee as in this case.

Q

MR. BAILEY:

I think you might have some constitutional

question there. Your Honor, but I think that —
Q

Wall, don't you have the same constitutional

questions here?
MR. BAILEYs
Q

Mo, Your Honor, “~*

Where the primary is "an integral part” of the

election machinery of the State of Tears.
MR. BAILEY:

Yes, sir.

But another part of this

integral machinery is the fact that a candidate, if ho wants
to be on the ballot, in the general election, there is a
process for getting on that will not cost him this filing fee.
I grant it is not a —
Q

Well, won't it cost him something?

MR. BAILEYs
Q

Mo, sir, it will not.

Well, won’t it cost him the paper for the petition

MR. BAILEYs

I presume it would cost him this, and

48
possibly the stamp or some of the othex
nature# Your Honor,
But 1 think that when we start talking, as the
court below did, that some other type fee other than this
high one would be acceptable, to me this is Incorrect, .beca«aa
X think that what more compelling or reasonable reason could,
the State have and to say 13We5.re going to set these filing
fees to where they will cover -tile cost of the election.M
X think that to say it could be some other# lower
fee# that had no basis of this nature, then if. wouldn’t be
possibly even reasonable or compelling.
Q

Mr. Bailey, one more

Why did you give us Exhibit A?

question, aside from this

What is -die purpose of that?

To your brief.
It’s that new statute.
MR. BAILEY;

X think it was — X don’t know at the

moment, X think that we were — just put it in so the Court,
could see what had been done in connection with the situation
that the trial court had — or the court below had put us
into, that the Legislature had to taka certain action, and
this was <■—
Q

What did the Legislature have to do?

MR. BAXLBYs
Q

Well, X think# Your Honor, —

What the Legislature did was to say if we don’t

do something they’ll have already done something.

43
MR., BAILEY:
Q

Is that the only purpose of it?

MR. BAILEYs
Q

Yes, sir.

I think that —

I can understand why the Legislature did it, but

X was just wondering why you, as an officer of this Court,
felt obliged to bring it before us.
MR. BAXLEY:

You Honor, I think it's nothing more

than to show what the Legislature had done, because 1 think
we're in this area of filing fees in the election process,
for the Court to know what we’re trying to do, X think
sometimes we don’t know what guidelines to

use, and if we’re

wrong in something, then it does give the Court opportunity to
possibly see the way we’re handling it, the way the Legislature
is possibly going to handle it, and where, if we're incorrect,
the Legislature will know what, next time, possibly to do to
correct any of these things. And this is my only explanation
for this.
Q

The decision of the District Court was

apparently in december of 1970.
MR. BAILEY:
Q

Yes.

So, have there been any elections since that time,

or were there any this past November?
MR. BAILEYs

No. The primaries will be coming up

this spring, and than the general election in the fall.
Q

There haven’t been any primary elections since

so
the court’s decision?
MR. BAILEYs

That’s correct.

But we submit t kt the payment of —• wa think that
what we've go : here in this particular case is that there are
several methods that a person can reach above the caucus.

They

can do it under a banner of a particular political party? they
can run in a general election on a write-in ~~ X mean by
getting on the ballot in the manner provided at the general
election.
X think that the court below said that some right
of the voter had been infringed upon here.

Actually, what

the court has said is that a voter has a right to vote for
a particular candidate, and if the State, by its statutes in
regulating the election process, doss anything to keep a
particular voter from voting for a particular candidate of
his choice, if anything keeps him off the ballot, be it a
filing fee, or some other problem of having to do something,
keeps him off the ballot, then it is constitutionally bad.
We think that .what has been done here is actually *—
and the burden has not been put on the voter by this, by the
law the way it is, it’s been put there now because ultimately
this statute being held invalid, that taxpayer who is also the
voter is going to now have to pick up the tab for these
elections rather than the candidate.
Thank you.
