MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'IX hear arguments next

in No. 113, Ford Motor Company against the United States.
Mr. Seymour, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WHITNEY NORTE SEYMOUR, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OS’ THE APPELLANT
MR. SEYMOUR:

May it please the Court:

I’m going to try to reserve a few minutes for reply.
This is a direct appeal from the judgment of -the
District Court in Detroit, holding that the acquisition in
1961 by Ford Motor Company of the spark plug business and the
name of the Autolite Company to enable Ford to supply its own
needs for original installation of spark plugs, and also to
supply replacement plugs to others.

And the acquisition

occurred after Ford had been the customer of ‘Champion, a leading
company in the business, for 50 years.
The court held that the acquisition violated Section
7 of the Clayton Act.

He directed divestiture, and then entered

seven rather extraordinary injunctions.
First, he enjoined Ford from going into the business
of making spark plugs by internal entry for tan years.

The

judgment enjoined Ford from making any plugs under its own
name for five years —* from marketing any plugs under its own

name for five years.

And required Ford to buy half its

requirements for five years from the purchaser of the divested

4
— the person divested.
When the case was triad, batteries were also involved,
but they’ve dropped out, they are not now involved.

That

matter having been satisfactorily disposed of.
Ford challenges the decision of the District Court
as to the violation, and submits that even if there was a
violation, divestiture in this case was not the bast remedy,
because other remedies, which I’ll mention, were; better.
ibid challenges all the extraordinary injunctions, with
particular weight on the injunction against internal entry and
the injunction against the use of the Ford name, which it
regards as definitely anti-competitive.
Now, I think it’s important to understand the nature
of tills industry, because, as in other cases, ti-a impact of
Section 7 depends on the nature of the industry in the particulax
situation involved.
General Motors has made its own spark plugs since
1909.

In that year it acquired the then Champion Spark Plug

business, and has since marketed spark plugs under the name of
AC, -the letters AC.

And at the time of the acquisition, General

Motors had 30 percent of the spark plug market.
When I say the spark plug market, I’m talking, for
the most part, about the — not the original installations but
the market in the — the so-called after-»market, the replacement
plugs? that's where the large amount of the plug business is

5
done.
Champion went back into the spark plug business,
after selling to General Motors, and has supplied — or had
at the time of the acquisition supplied Ford for 30 years*
And in 1936 Autolxte came into the business and
began to supply Chrysler»

And Champion got 50 percent of the

business, had 50 percent of the business at. the time of the
acquisition.

That is, General Motors 30, Champion 50, and

Autolite about 15.
And the balance of a few percent was sort of — was
spread among small manufacturers, mostly in the private brand
market.

Now, the private brand market is the market served

by such companies as Sears, Roebuck and Montgomery Ward, and
other mass merchandisers, and some of the oil companies who
market spark plugs under their own tradenames.
In 1960-61, in those years, Chrysler got very
concerned — 2 mean Aufcolite got very concerned because it saw
signs that Chrysler might be getting ready to go into the
spark plug business itself, and that might leave it with an
expensive plant, which the court below described as a potential
albatross if it couldn’t do something about, it.
So it came to Ford and offered to sell the spark
plug business to Ford, and the Autolite name for spark plugs,
and other uses, and they worked out a deal, under which Ford
Bought these assets, including the battery assets which are no

6
longer involved, for a total of $28 million. And Autclite
became ElffiRA, so that there vis.s a new company with the noma of
ELTRA created, which carried or the portion of he business
not sold by iVxtolita to Ford, and EXTRA has built a spark plug
plant in Alabama and is in the business or supplying spark
plugs largely for the private brand market.
Ford, in connection with the sale, agreed to buy
12 million plugs from ELTRA over a period of two years, and
also to provide it with certain ceramic parts.

And thereupon

Ford was in the business under the Autolite name;

Champion

became Chrysler*s supplier; and it took a large part of a year
to change over from Champion plugs to Autolite plugs, and work
out the technical difficulties involved.

And also to foogin

the process of improving the distribution system.
And it took about the same time for Chrysler to get
started with its new supplier, Champion.
At the time of the acquisition, or just before the
acquisition, Ford had some 14 percent of the spark plug
business, and after the acquisition Ford’s percentage gradually
came up and Champion’s went down, and General Motors has
retained, or remained about the same, although it's gone up a
little bit.
Q

What was the Champion figure?

MR. SEYMOUR?
SO percent.

The Champion figure originally was

At the time of the acquisition —

7
Q

1961?

MR» SEYMOURs

I960 — yes,. 1960-61.

Just before

the acquisition»
And Ford's was 30, and Autolite‘s was about 13»
.And when Ford cam© in, the Autolite business be<|an to go up,
so that by about 19™ — in the late 196Q*s, Ford’s business
was up to about 19 percent, and Champion' s business had corae
down from 50 to about 40, and General Motors’ had remained
about the same.

That’s gone up a little bit.

It isn’t correct, as the government suggests, that
this was all automatic, that all 'dial: happened was that the
Champion business want down anc the Autolite business want
up, and it was just as a result of changing suppliers.

There

was active and intense competition in the after'-market, and
it was .as a result of that competition that these changes in
percentages took

place.

True, they seem like relatively small changes in
percentage, but each percentage point was about four million
plugs, and it’s a substantial amount of business

involving

thousands and thousands of transactions„
1 think Your Honors will be satisfied when I finish
describing the industry, that historically there have been,
since IS36, only three major suppliers to the automobile
companies, and that before that there were only two, and that
the business does not accommodate itself to more than three

8
major suppliers •

There is this private market business r but

inevitably there are» in this business, I think, only
is room only tor three major suppliers.

there

And that's because of

the special nature of the plug in the business, which I'll now
turn, to.
I

Without going into any detail of the mechanics, the
spark plug is a small but essential part of an automobile,
and a truck, and also is used in tractors, lawn mowers, and
sc on.

It has, as you know, two electrodes.

It's inserted

in the cylinder to jump the spark caused by power from the
generator to ignite the mixture of oil — or gasoline and air
in the cylinder, and cause the explosion which drives the
engine,
The plugs are carefully engineered to particular
makes and models.

It takes the plug manufacturers and the

automobile manufacturers, working .closely together over a long
period of time, to get just the right form and construction of
the plug.

And to make it deal most effectively with the

particular model for which it's used.
Just as an example, 1 think Ford now makes some 80
different motors, and has 80 different,.plugs for those motors.
The use of -die wrong plug can cause malfunctioning,
affect the exhaust fumes from the engine, and could cause
serious damage«
Now, the plugs are installed at the factory in what

9
is called OS installation, that’s original equipment installa­
tion.

And the automobile manufacturer! buys or makes these

plugs 4. and they are put in the car and then the car is sold.
And about six — about IS months after the car is sold, the
average car owner goes around and gets a tune-up and has a
replacement of the plugs, and the plugs are replaced about
five times during the use df the average automobile*

And that

means that on a six-cylinder car there are 3G plugs that are
bought over that period? on an eight-cylinder car, 40 plugs.
The facts 1 ara'stating Z think there is no dispute
about.

We’re at one about, 2 think, th« nature of the market

and the facts about the market? and, indeed, many of them were
stipulated.
The most replacement plugs are inserted by mechanics
in the course o£ a tune-up.

One doesn’t ordinarily take his

car around and says’, .”X need a new spark plug", but usually
he’s going to a garage or a service station or some other
place, to have the car timed up and gone over.

And it’s at

that time that the mechanice ordinarily inserts the new plugs.
And the new plugs are such a minor part of the cost
of that operation that really price and cost of the plugs
to the customer are of no moment.

So that there is little,

if any, price competition at that level.
The mechanic —
0

Well, -then, the customer doesn't really choose,

10
either, does he?

It's the mechanic that probably chooses the

plugs.
MR. SEYMOUR;
Q

; That's right.

What plugs to put in.

MR. SEYMOUR: That's right.

The mechanic, on the

basis of his experience and knowledge, ordinarily makes the
choice.
Now, he chooses the plug which ordinarily ■— the
plug which was originally installed.

This propensity of

mechanics to use the plug originally installed :ls called, in
this record,

sometimes the OB tie, which merely means the

propensity of mechanics to use the same plug in replacement,
that was there originally.

And he does this because he knows

about the fact that the plug was originally designed for that
car, and he doesn't want to tale any risks about it.

He

doesn’t want to think that he’s smarter than the engineering
departments that designed it.
Now, there are all-purpose plugs manufactured by
all these companies, and the average garageman or service station
man stocks some of the plugs, font usually not all the plugs.
Usually, if, the record shows, that sometimes the garage owner
of the filling station owner has only the AC plug or sometimes
only the Champion plug, but usually both of those because
they're so popular.
had then, at the time of this .acquisition, relatively

few of these places also stocked the Autolite plugs•

And one

of the great efforts here, in the competitive struggle, has
been to get more and more of these places to stock the
antolite parts, plugs.
If they don’t have the —
Q

Well, now, up to the time of this acquisition,

all General Motors cars had AC plugs?

MR. SEYMOUR:

That's right.

And all Chrysler cars had Electric — had

Chrysler.

But from '36 until the time of this

acquisition —>
MR. SEYMOUR:
Q

-•* what I've said is correct.

MR. SEYMOUR:
Q
•flie

That's right.

Correct. That's right.

And then if it's — if, as you ta 11 vuSf it, was

habit or practice of mechanics to install as replacement

plugs the original equipment plugs, why wouldn't they have

12
.-stocked all three, just 1 n the ordinary course of business'?
Became these are the so-called Big Three automobiles *
MR. SEYMOUR:

Well, generally speaking, there are

perhaps two reasons, as far as the Aufcolite plug —- or the Ford
Champion plug, to take that first.
Ford tried to distribute these plugs through its
franchised dealers, and the franchised dealers were no longer
handling that, or about the time of the acquisition, && Kl£M1^/
of the installations as the filling stations and others.
And the filling station proprietors and the garage proprietors
were concerned about not having too large an inventory.

And

naturally they would maintain an inventory which would do the
beat job in supplying plugs for the largest possible number
without too much of an investment.
So there was a tendency to have the major lines,
and the Auto11te line had difficulty getting in, as is
indicated by the fact that between about the time of the
acquisition and the late 'GO’S, the percentage of Ford sales
in the after-market crept up some 5 percent, which X think is
represented by lube increased stocking of these plugs in the
market.
Now, the — I mentioned the all-purpose plug. All
these companies make all-purpose plugs, so that if the
mechanic doesn’t have- the OE plug at ’the time, he can try to
do the best lie can by using an all-purpose plug, which is sort of

13
a compromise.

It's not as good, many people think, as the OB

plug, but it's Letter than a plug that was mada for a wholly
different kind of a car, and it's kind of a compromise solution,
Q

Didn’t I read somewhere in .the record -that there

had been testimony to the effect that in most of the filling
stations, they didn’t appear to want to carry more than two
different brands?
MR. SEYMOORs That was so for a long time, and the
business of trying to get them to carry three took a lot of
effort.

And that's what went on.
Now, the OE use is of such importance to the

manufacturer, that Champion, beginning in 1920, started what
is known as the 6-cent OB price.

It began to sell the plugs

for original installation at six cents.

And then everybody —-

all the other manufacturers followed suit.

So that all the

plugs for original equipment installation were sold at six
cents.

And the cost of the plugs was three or four times as

much as that.
So that "the manufacturer used this

low OE price

to get in arid get the business, and than he had to make up
for the loss on that same by a higher price on the sales for
the after-market, for the replacement plugs.
And so this is a very important part, of the getting
into the business end holding the business, and is a fact of
life which, is unusual in this industry, I think.

of the fact that the plugs ar-a originally installed as pof other work, that their price is of little cr no moment.
.tod this — one of the reasons that the price in the business
has been sc stable is that in 1953 all of the plug manufacturer
had cases before the Federal Trade Commission which involved
the question of whether they could distinguish in price between
the various types of distributors who distributed their plugs,
including the other companies who might distribute their
plugs, and the Federal Trade Commission held that they had to
give the same price to everybody in the distribution chain.
tod tills has naturally kept the plug manufacturers
from lowering their price because if they did they had to do it
to everybody,

tod therefore they couldn’t do it in the

ordinary* competitive way.
The court below regarded one of the important
factors as to whether or not 'the Champion

or Ford8 a

relations to Champion tended to moderate Champion*s price, and
he held that it did.

tod it was his view that somehow Ford

being a large customer of Champion moderated Champion's price.
Now, on this record, that’s just a theory.

There was

no proof, and there’s nothing in this record to show that there
was any such moderation.

1 would take it that the original

equipment price, given 50 years ago, is hardly a moderation
which would stil 1 persist in any realistic sense at the time of

the acquisition.
It was reality not. a moderationf it was a sort of a
payment for entrance, or an arrangement for entr anca«
And, aside from that, the record doesn * t show any
moderation»

Ford had to pay a higher price in * 59 and '60 for

its plugs than other people did, and -there isn't any evidence
of moderation.
The suggestion is made that — and the court examined
this carefully — that Ford was a potential competitor and that
under Fenn-OIln somehow this acquisition was bad.
Kow, the court took testimony, and the government
tried very hard to try to show that Ford was on the verge of
entering this business.

But the evidence the court found did

not show that Ford was on. the brink of entering this business.
There are certain memoranda in the record which indicate that
there was a study made of that subject, several studies.
but they never reached the point of top-leva1 consideration.
And the reason they didn't was that, and the tesfcimon
of Mr. Duffy in the record, which the court accepted, was that
plugs were available to Ford for OB installation at one-third
of cost? Ford didn't, have at that time any engineers who were
expert in the plug business. or even in the ceramic business
that they had no distribution system which was adequate at
that time to enable them to compete effectively in the
a. £ te r-marks t *

And then the undisputed evidence is, and the

16
court recognised it and everybody recogn ised it,

that after

original OS installation of a new plug, it fcfe'ces five to oight
years to have enough vehicles cn the rood with that plug in
them to really do a lot of business in the after-marketi
And so anybody going into the plug business, as a
major manufacturer, had to face all these difficulties;

the

problem of five to sight years before he could really rise
on the after-market? the problem of the loss which was involved
in connection with getting — having something other than the
six-oent price? the problem of working out the technicalities,
and

so on*
So, it’s clear, 1 think, that Ford was not a potential

competitor, and the court didn51 conclude that it was*

spent more tine over the industry than I intended to.
The court — I pointed out, I thinks that Ford
considered that making this acquisition would enable it to
get into the business and compete effectively? and that
expectation was realised because the competition has increased
since Ford made this acquisition.

And it * s perfectly clear

that it: was not just a slipping around of percentages* but it
was a genuine increase in competition in the market*
This acquisition* we submit, was pro-competitive
because it made Ford a — Ford was a stronger arid more
effective competitor than Autolite had been*

Where there'were

three companies before the acquisition, the creation of ELTRA
after the — in connection with the acquisition,- a company
which is now an effective competitor in the private brand
market, and the fact that Champion, having lost a portion of
its interest and its sales in the after-market, has had to
become a snore effective and active competitor, ir. the private,
brand market*

All, 1 submit, are contributions to competition*

And so, we submit, that it was a pro-competitive
acquisition.
Now, the court below, as 1 suggested, regarded the
fact that although Ford was not a potential entrant, it still
moderated Champion’s price, and also the fact that the
acquisition somehow foreclosed competition and perhaps also

18
increased barriers to entry as the grounds upon which it
decided the Section 7 case adversely to Ford.,
Now,, as 1 have said# there is no evidence in tills
record of moderation of Champion's prices.

There is no fore­

closure of anybody but Champion, and Champion has had to simply
get out and compete in a different way.
This is not. a case like Brown Shoo# where there were
sales being made by competitors in the market# and such sales

.

would have gone on but for the acquisition.
It’s not a case like many of your cases on potential
competition# where a potential competitor was acquired and
absorbed# and there was no substitute, as there was here? for
the absorption here, the acquisition gave rise to a stronger
competitor.
And as far as barriers to entry is concerned# I hope
I’ve made clear that any company seeking to go into the making
of spark plugs for use in automobiles had to face the barriers
to entry which were inherent ir. the business; that is# that they
had to Sell at a low price# at a loss# -they had to make up that
loss over a period of years through the replacement market.
They couldn’t get into the replacement market for five to
eight years.

They had to work out all kinds of technical

difficulties in arriving at the thing.
So that, really, -the idea that little companies were
in a position to come knocking on the door and get the business

19
is just a concept of an unnecessary charade.

It would be'just

a charade to suggest that small manufacturers were in a position
to come in and get that business.
Now, Champion, if this transaction had not taken
place, it. seems clear on this record that vrhat would have
happened would be that Champion would have continued, as it
had for SO years, to be Ford's supplier, and -the market would
have been just what .it was before.
Instead of that, -tine market has become more competi­
tive as a result of Ford's activity in it, and the creation
of ELTE& as a real competitor, and the fact that Champion has
had to scramble now for business by competing in the private
brand market all are contributions to competition.

MR. SSYMOURs

Sc the;".a may wall have been used for

original —q

Those were for original installation?

MR. SEYMOUR;

They might well have been used for that

purpose „
Now, I must come to the problem of relief.
Let me just# before I come to that, I really think
that the government’s position and the court's position here
was, without any -- kind of a sub silentio treatment; that
Ford being a large customer must, as a matter of law, be
regarded as having somehow moderated without regard to the
facts, and thus, that any acquisition involving such a large
customer must be regarded as, per se, illegal.
The court doesn't use those words, but I think that’s
the necessary implication.

And I submit that there are quite

enough per se rules now without adding one in this field.
And, furthermore, it would be very unsound, indeed, to treat a
customer in the same position as one, as Your Honor said, in
Penn-01.in, "waiting anxiously on the edge of the market to come
in*"
Now, on reliefs

If I've satisfied Your Honors that

there is no violation, that's the end of the case.
If Your Honors think — as far as we're concerned -if Your Honors think that there was a violation, we submit that
divestiture in this case was ar, improper remedy.

21
We know that divestiture is usually the remedy.

But

Tom: Honors have laid it down that it is not imucorebiy the
remedy, and here the effect of divestiture, as v?e5ve shown in
our brief, would have been one of two things;

either, after

all the effort involved in divestiture, all that would have
happened would have been that -the new Fostoria, the purchaser
would have become tied to Ford just as the old company — just,
as Champion had been.

The market would have been just as it

was before, and all the advantages, the proselytativa advantage
of tills acquisition would have been lost.
And the alternative to that, which is perhaps still
worse, is that after the five years, during which Ford had to
take half of its requirements from new Fostoria, 'the company
would not have been able to market? somehow it would have lost
its markets, and it would have failed,

And then the whole

thing would have gone for naught, with great economic loss to
the public.
Mow, let me leave that.
Ford made a proposal, which I think really was, in
this setting, far more fruitful than divestiture.

And that

was that for ten years; it should buy 30 million plugs from the
~~ from EKfM.
plugs.

ELTRA then had a capacity of about 20 million

.Annual purchases of 30 million would have put ELTRA in

a position to sell 50 or more million a year, and made it an
effecfcive competitor.

And that relief, in lieu of divestiture, would have
done more to improve the competitive situation titan
divestiture would have done.
Let me come to the injunctions, because these are
things in which 1 have a deep concern, and X haven’t left
myself any time to talk about them.
The injunction which the court granted forbidding
Ford, by internal entry, to go in and manufacture for tea years
is absolutely unprecedented, as far as I knowj it's clearly
anti-competitive? it’s effect would be to deprive Ford of a
right ‘that everybody else has, that General Motors had and
exercised; and there's absolutely no reason, except some
backhanded penalty,for

any such harsh injunction.

My learned friends say, Well, Ford — it would have
taken Ford a while to get into the business, and it wasn’t time
to go into the business anyhow.

That does not rake away, X

think, from an error in the court below in granting such a
sweeping, unprecedented and, unjustified injunction.
And in the same category is the injunction against
Ford using its own name, after ~~ for five years.
That means that Ford would have to buy not only
half its plugs from BLTR& — or from now Foster!a, but would
have to buy the rest of its plugs from somebody else under that
person’s trade name and not use the Ford name.

So that Ford

would be forbidden from really beginning to edge into this

23
market under its own name, for a long period of
is no precedent for any such relief as that.

'C3JEG ,

There

St is unnecessary

and clearly anticompetitive.
Now, I won't argue the performance contract, which is
the third injunction, because, in my own view, if
divestiture was proper, if there was a violation and divestiture
was proper- that injunction may have been useful in implementing
the divestiture and in insuring the divested company of
business for a period of time.
And while it's unusual, and I think unnecessary, I
won't press that.
It seems to me the other two injunctions, whatever
Your Honors do with divestiture and violation, are clearly
erroneous and the decree should be reversed on that ground
alone.

It is our view that it should be reversed across the

board.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR, FRIEDMAN:
the Courts
■

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

’
Section '7 "Of the Clayton Act, of course, deals with

probabilities not with certainties.

The statutory standard

is that acquisitions are condemned whose effect may be — may

24
be — subsi:.

tially to lessen competition.

And as this Court

has stated, and as the legislative history indicates, all that
is required is that there be a reasonable probability of an
anti -competi tive effect.
And in -the ^Philadelphia Bank opinion, this Court
stated

that a determination of whether there is such a

reasonable probability of anti-competitive effect, said t?requi
not merely an appraisal of the immediate impact of the merger
upon competition, but a prediction of its impact upon
comaptitive conditions in the future.”

And also added that

a prediction as to the future impact is sound ’only if it is
based upon a firm understanding of -the structura of the ,, .
market.N
That is. the impact of Section 7 is to prevent anti
competitive changes in the structure of the market, the way
the market operates.
Now, there is no question about the market in this
case.

It's one of the most concentrated markets that we can

find. '
For more than 20 years, the three leading firms have
had between 90 and 95 percent cf the market, in most instances

closer to 95, and that condition has continued since the
acquisition.
•

There are also, as Mr. Seymour has indicated, high

entry barriers in this market, primarily because of the fact

that due to the OB tie. a manuiacture:?: finds it almost
impossible to get into the lucrative replacement market unless
he has the OB tie, he can’t get the OB tie unless you can get
the business of one of the major automobile manufacturers„
Q

And in order to do that, you have to sell way

below cost.
MR. FRIEDMANS

You have to sell way below cost.

So what you have is, this is a market where there’s
a high concentration and very high barriers to entry.

And it’s

to b© expected in such a market, there’s a little price competi­
tion*

I'm not talking now of the price competition at the

service station or the garage level, where you go to have your
motor tuned.

I'm talking of the competition at the next

level, at the distributor level, at the warehouse level, Idle
prices at which the manufacturers and the distributors of
spark plugs put the plugs into the distribution channels.
Q

Mr. Friedman, do you agree with Mr. Seymour

that, as a result of the acquisition in *61, the giants Eire
less big and the lesser companies are bigger, have a greater
share of the total market?
MR. FRIEDMANs

We don't agree as he characterizes it.

Of course, as a result of the acquisition, Ford now

Autolite

in the hands of Ford now has a' greater share of the market than
Autolite had before 'the acquisition.

But of course what has

happened is that since the Ford account was a much larger

26
account than the Chrysler account# /vscessnriiy when Autolite
shifted its custom from Chrysler to Ford# it necessarily got
a larger share of the market.

And conversely, when Champion#

after it had lost the Ford account# picked up fie Chrysler
account# if had a smaller share of the market.
Now# we're not saying that the corresponder.es
automatic , but we think this reflects a major share of the
shift in the market..

But we don’t think the market is any

more competitive# Mr. Chief Justice.
We had an economist who testified on this# and the
fact of the matter is that even after the shift# there’s been
no basic change in the market.
listic.

The market is still oligopo­

The market is still — the Big Three have 95 percent.

There is still virtually no price competition in the market.
This new competitor that's bean referred to# the
ELTR& Company; the ELTRA Company# as the District Court
char notorized it# is a pygmy.

It has something new -«-/even

now something like 1.4 or 1.6 percent cf the market.

Xt has

its own name brand Prestollto# which has made very little
progress in the market.

It's basically attempting to sell in

the after-market, through the private brand labels # and it just
can’t get in to the market in any substantial measure because
of the original equipment tie.
We believe — we do not concede that the market is
any more competitive

27
Q

Who is at the top of the market now?

MR, FRX3DMAN;
Q

•

Still Champion,

But don't they have to try harder as a result of

this,, to hold their position?
MR. FRIEDMANs Well, they may have to

~~ they may have

to try harder;, they may have to sell more,, because, having
lost the Ford account, -they may find it necessary to fight
more vigorously for business in the after-market.

But,

never the 3.
shares among the firms in the market.

And we had an economist,

a distinguished economist, Professor Maim, who testified that
in a market of this type, a market of this type, the shifting
of shares, slight shifting of shares among the three leading
firms that together had S5 percent, does not really reflect
any greater vigor of competition in the market.
There's no price competition.

This has not injected
»

any greater price competition into the market.
Q

Thera's no —

Is price the only area of competition, or --

MR. FRIEDMANs

Price is not the only area of

competition, Mr. Chief Justice.

But one of the characteristics

of an oligopolistic market is the absence of price competition,
and price competition is, in a sense, the ultimate of
competition.

I mean, that’s what it's really all about is

prices.
And if you get: into a market of this type, Where you

28
have a rigid structure $ and I might mentior, in passing# -one
of the things that’s pointed out by our economist... and one of
the things that the record shews, is in this type of a market
profits are very high.

Although the average return of all

manufacturing enterprises in the country is 10 percent on
investment, Champion over a 15-year period had an average of
25 percent»
Q

Mr. Friedman, do you have any comment, perhaps

it isn't in the case, as to the very advantageous position
that GM occupies here?

Maybe there isn’t anything you can do

about it.
MR. FRIEDMAN*

I don’t think there’s anything, Mr.

Justice, that can be done about it here, except, I think the
fact 'that GM lias in effect tied up such a large share of the
market, because of its own manufacturing of plugs, is an
important consideration as to why it's significant and vital
to preserve the other forces in the market that tend to be
competitive.
And I would like to turn —
Q

But this is small comfort to Ford, 1 suppose?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That may be, Mr. Justice.

On the other hand, the fact that General Motors is
now engaged in the manufacture of its own spark plugs is no
reason why Ford should foa permitted to do the same thing.
Whereas, we believe — and X will come to this in a minute now

29
we think the effect of Ford’s acquisition of the Autolite
Company and going into the manufacture has definite anti”
competitive consequences.
Q

But you would not object to Ford talcing the

time to develop it internally, 1 take it?
.MR. FRSBDMANs

Shat is correct.

Mr. Justice, speaks of acquisition,
develop it internally.
Q

Because Section 7,

liny firm if; fras to

That's exactly —

Because Ford, under this decree, would be

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Undor this decree, and as X will

come to the reason for that, Mr. Justice, is that Ford is
prohibited frofei manufacturing for ten years in order to give
the divested company the opportunity to get on its feet
again.
Basically, it's an attempt ~~ Ford, for ten years,
has had the benefits of the ownership of Electric Autolite.

It has built- 'up

If

a staff of

It acquired Autolite * s entire distribution

system, its entree to these warehouse distributors who are
so important in penetrating into the after-market.
And the purpose of the ten-year provision, in effect,
is to put the thing back, put the thing back to where it was
before.

Once again, Ford, will be a customer, there will be a

large independent manufacturer, and to give thi

large company

the opportunity to begin. to dovslog.
Because —* if I may just say one other thing on
that# Mr. Justice — if Ford was permitted to go into
manufacture immediately, the likely — first, the likely thing
that would happen would foe this?

— well, and of course I

might mention that the provision for the decree are all
interrelated, because if Ford ware permitted to go into
manufacture itself, and there was no ban on the use of Ford’s
name, or even with the present thing, what probably would
happen is Ford would purchase its 50 pereant requirement of
the divested plant and put those plugs into the after-market,
to sell for the replacement in tin.® Ford cars that are already
on the road, and would begin manufacturing unde:: its own
name, selling under its own name.
hnd by the —* in a very short period, after five
or six years, when the market for the replacement plugs is.
exhausted, this new company would find itself with no basis
at all.

It would have no OS tie, because Ford itself would be

using its own brand on the plugs, and it would be left kept
of floundering, if this is the word, trying to break into the
after-market
And this is designed, this prevision and all of the
provisions of the decree are designed to give the new company
an opportunity to get a foothold, at least, in the marketi
to try to restore as much as possible the market structure the

existed

before the acquisition*
By the new -company you mean the so-called mm

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

The divested company.

Yea.

Mr.Friedman, would you care to speculate on

what impact this will have on Champion and General Motors,
if any, or isn’t there anything in that area that you can
.speculate about?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think it's dangerous to speculate,

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that presumably, what is likely to
happen is this*

The divested plant, the new Fostoria, under

this decree, knows that at the end of five years it. may or
may not continued with any part of Ford’s business.

It’s

obviously going to be under pressures as a result of this
decree.

First, to try to gain all of Ford’s business in the

initial five years, not just the 50 percent? and then to keep
the business after the five years.
It doesn't, know, however, what is going to happen.
Conceivably, after five years, Ford ray take its business
elswhere.

Or after Ten. years Ford may decide to manufacture."

('Ij

CS<i

So I think what's likely to happen is, from the
very outset, the new Fogtoria is going to do two things:
One, it's going to do everything it can to try to satisfy
Ford in terms of quality, in terms of fair pricing, et cetera;
secondly, it's going to be aware of the fact that at the end
of five years it has no assured market.

If. may have to start

fighting at this point in the after-market, and therefore it
seems to me, in the initial five-year period, the new company
is going to do everything it can to try to build its business
in the after-market.
And if it's going to be building its business and
competing vigorously in the after-market, 1 presume that
Chrysler and General Motors will also feel the impetus to
compete vigorously,
Wow, if X may, 1 would like now to — having gone to
the second part of the case in some detail as to relief, Iwould now like to go on to discuss the merits of the case,
the finding of violation.
Q

Well, 2 take it, Mr. Friedman, you've indicated

a while ago the market really hasn’t changed much?
MR. FRIEDMANs That’s correct,
Q

Has it become any more competitive?

MR. FRIEDMAN: We don’t think so.
Q

Then it remains about the same, -hen?

is after ten years?

And this

33
MR. FRIEDMANi This is after ton years»
Q

But you still think that it might get worse?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It's hard to say.

St could get

worse, I suppose it —
Q

Well, if it's hard to say, then what about —

what's the antitrust case all about?

I mean if: this really

hasn't changed the market much, it doesn't make much difference
one way or the other whether Ford doss or doesn:t own this
company.
MR. FRIEDMAN; Well, we —
Q

What — and perhaps you say we must ignore the

experience of ten years? soma cases perhaps indicate that.
But ten years is a long time for it to view the impact on .the
market, and you seem to indicate there isn't much impact at

Q

No, I didn't —

But nevertheless you want divestiture.

MR. FRIEDM&N:

No, 1 did not ~~ I'm sorry, Mr.

Justice, I did not intend to indicate that there's no impact.
What has happened in the market has been that the — two things
have happened in the market, and these were the consequences,
the basis of the District Court's decision.
First, the opportunity of other spark plug manufactur­
ers to sell in the large segment of the market represented by
Ford's purchases from Champion has been eliminated.

That's

34
the first thing.
Second!;/, —

T‘XX/ -

'

11

That's the wav it was before.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, there's the opportunity, there9!

a very great distinction, Mr. Justice ~~
Q

The opportunity for some company to beat out

Champion with Ford?
MR. FRIEDMANs That, is correct.

And that opportunity

was irrevocably lost, it was irrevocably lost by the
o

foreclosure.
I will come in a minute* as we've discussed in our
brief — there's evidence in the record that during the time
that. Champion was supplying Ford, close to the time of the
acquisition
Q

So the market, if Ford hadn't acquired this

company, the market might have improved in the last tan years?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

Might have improved,

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It most certainly might have improved

There's evidence that people were trying to sell to Ford.
AutoXite was trying to sell to Ford.

Another company called

General Battery and Ceramics Corporation was trying to sell to
Ford.
Once this acquisition took place, these companies

35
£ topped trying to sell to Ford, they had no m ore chance of
selling to Ford than they had of selling to General Motors.
Because that market was foreclosed.
Now, in addition to that, the other thing this
acquisition did was it removed the pro-campetitive effect,
the mediating influence that Ford had upon the market.

And

this impact on the market was twofoldi
First, Ford as a potential entrant into -the market;
and, secondly, the impact Ford had as a customer.
Q

But from what you5re saying now, 1 should have

thought you might have considered getting a divestiture decree
of some kind in the General Motors-Champion area, too.
Aren81 you dealing in speculation here —i

!

MR. FRIEDMANs
Q

Well, Mr. Justice, *--*

MR. FRIEDMftNs

Mr. Justice, a very significant •.

distinction. Champion was not acquired by Chrysler.

Champion

and Chrysler have a sales »•»
Q

I realise that.

But they've dominated the

market for all this period, haven't they?
MR. FRXEDMANs They are the largest in the market, and
perhaps at some point we should proceed against Champion, I
don't know. But that, it seems to me, again is no reason not
to overturn ~~ not to permit — no reason to permit this
acquisition, which is one we think clearly within the terms of

Section 7
Q

Champion is a publicly held corporation, isn’t

it?
MR. FRIEDMAN; Champion is a publicly lie Id corporation.
And very interestingly — vary interestingly, the question as
to whether Ford, whether Ford would itself become a manufactures t.
There are two things.

First, in 1960 'there were some studies

made by a high-level Ford group, which recommended to the
top management that Ford itself go into the manufacturing of
spark plugs.
And in addition to that, in 1958, —

management not to do it

37
MR, FRXBJDMAH:

But It dees indicate — it does

indicate, Mr* Justice, that Ford was thinking about it.

And

as the District Court said, Ford was the leading potential
entrant.

And I refer this Court to its decision in the

Procter a Gamble case, in which the Court stated -» there the
Court of Appeals had reversed the Commission’s finding that
Procter £ Gamble was a probable, likely entrant into the
household bleach industry on the ground there was no showing
that in fact it was going to do it.
And this Court, in reversing, said: That’s immaterial,
the important thing is that it was the most probable entrant.
And we think this is the most probable entrant.
Q

Well, except here you have an explicit

decision not to do it.
MR. FRIEDMANs

Like you just told us.
You have a decision not. to do it?

but, at least as far as people in the industry were concerned,
as far as the spark plug manufacturers were concerned, to them
it was certainly not beyond the bound of possibility that
Ford would integrate.
Let me just mention one other thing, Mr. Justice,
in connection with Champion.
In 1958, Champion, for the first time, went public
as a corporation.

Of course it had to file a registration

statement with the SEC.

And one of the things that came out

In this registration statement was the very high rate of

38
return Champion was making,
■ And a witness from Electric Autoiite said

that h©

thought it was not improbable that when Ford realised that for
all these years Champion has been making this average of 25
percent rate of return to a large erfcant, as a result of
Ford business, that Ford would very seriously think about going
into the business*
Q

that Ford may enter.
Q

Right,

MR. FRIEDMANi

That you've talked about.
I’ve talked about.

The second one

is that her© is Ford, a very large customer in an industry that
is very concentrated, and Champion knew that it had to satisfy
Ford in order to keep the business.
If
here.

1

may just refer, Your Honor, to one statement

On page 35 of the record, this is the testimony of

Champion’s vice president in charge of sales
of the page,

and he said;

We were concerned about Autolite getting in there,
because there were no actual affiliations» no financial
arrangements between Ford and Champion» it was just a year-toyear arrangement» and we had to sell them a quality product and
service them well to retain that business.
And if Autolite had been able to persuade them that
they could have done as well or better» our account would be
in jeopardy.
That is, Chrysler knew that in this peculiar
market it had to satisfy Ford among other thing; on price.
Q

Champion, you mean.

MR. FRIEDMAN;

I'm sorry.

Champion had to satisfy

Ford on price.
Q

price on the replacement parts.

It’s basically the

It's basically the replace-

ment plugs. which they sell for anywhere from 3.3 to 40 cents.

Because that's where the big profit is.
Q

Sell them to Ford and Ford sends them to its

distributors and dealers?
MR, FRIEBMANs They sell them to Ford ar to the
warehouse distributor»
Q

Yes.

MR, FRIEDMAN: And then? in turn* Ford sends them to
its dealers, and Ford itself distributes them through the ware­
house dealers,
Q

I thought — I thought in recent years a

majority of the replacement, the after-market, was distributed
through filling stations and service stations?
MR, FRIEDMAN:
Q

That is the majority of —

And not by Ford.

MR, FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

But Ford itself —

but Ford itself, in addition to distributing to its dealers,
also distributes through

the warehouse distributors.

In other words, the Ford Autolite plug today appears
not only in Ford dealers but also in service stations and
garages, and so on.

Q

I'm interested, in what he says two lines down

from where you read, in response to a question»

He said,

“We are very vulnerable that Chrysler" •**-* and he's speaking
of the relationship, the new relationship with Chrysler —»
"I mean we don't rest on our laurels any single day, because

Well, all that I read is that --

Doss that mean that under the new situation

they have to try harder?
MR. FRXEDMANs

Mo, X think that it's a recognition

on his part that they previously had to try to deal with
Ford, now they still have to try to keep the Chrysler account.
But the Chrysler account is, of course, a much
smaller account.
Q

MR. FRIEDMANz And also I think there's a recognition
that the — of course, as we've indicated, Prestollte at the
moment does not have an OB, any OE tie.

course there's competition here.

But •the important thing is,

what the acquisition did in terms of the prior competition.

in the market.

MR. FRIEDMAN;
Prestolite plug.
Q

Right.

MR. FRIEDMANs

Now, we were discussing the fact
♦

that Ford, on the edge of the market, was a mediating
influence because of the pressures that it could exert on
Champion, and the possibility it might enter.

There’s another

aspect of the case, another ground on which the District Court
rested its decision, and that’s the fact that the effect of
•this acquisition was to foreclose sellers of spark plugs from
the significant share of the market I have mentioned.
Ford, at the time it was buying from Champion, before
the acquisition, had approximately ten percent of the entire
spark plug market.

And this was roughly 40 million plugs,

and the value of these plugs was almost $10 million.
And the impact, of course, of this foreclosure was
even the greater because of the fact that GM, which made
approximately 50 percent of the cars, had in effect pre-empted
almost 50 percent, 45 percent at that time, of -:he OB market,
and thus the OE *— and this closed off this big share of the
OE market, and when Ford acquired its share of the market, th@r<

45
was a. fors closure of a greater share of fro CE market than the;
actual ten percent shows.
Now, Ford * s answer to this, to this foreclosure
point is saying, Well, there is really no significant
foreclosure here, because the market was really tied up with
We have been buying from Champion for 50 or 50

Champion,

years, and if the acquisition hadn't taken place, it would
have continued.
Therefore, there was no foreclosure because all
•these people were excluded from was a market they could never
have hoped to have gotten in any —
Q

Well, what percentage of the total market was

the OB market?
MR, FKEEDMANs

It's roughly — oh, I'd say about

15 percent, roughly.
Q

So Champion, say, was selling, in its prior

arrangement, selling 85 pereant of its plugs in the after-market?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
bit.

Roughly — well, it may vary a little

It may vary a little.

Q

Then, so we're really talking about when Ford

gets cut of a customer position, we're talking about fore­

What has Ford got, 40 percent of the -*•- 30 percent —

made prior to the acquisition.
Q

Well, I’m just trying to find out how much of

that market you. can really say was foreclosed.
is only 15 percent of the total market.
only a third.

The OS market

Ford's share of it is

That's 5 percent of the OE market that's

foreclosed.
How much perdent of the after-market has actually
beeforeclosed by Ford's acquisition, in the sense that
places competitiers used to be able to sell in, they could
no longer sell?
MR. FRXEDMM3s

Well, but they used to be able to sell

to Ford, they would sell to Ford and Ford, in turn, would,
distribute in the after-market, and they're foreclosed from
selling to Ford
market.

the products that Ford would sell in the after-

had that total, that plus -the OE market, comes to

ten percent of total spark plug production.
Q

When you say "they”, you mean Champion?

For 50 years, when you say "they" used to be able to sell to
Ford.

MR, FRIEDMANs
Q

No —

It was Champion that sold to Ford.

MR, FRIEDMAN:;

No, what 29ra suggesting is that a firm

like Autolita at least could try to sell.
Q

But, they weren't able to?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

They weren't .sisIs •—

For 50 to 60 years it was Champion and only

Champion»
MR. FRIEDMAN: They weren't able to, but they tr:' ad.
They weren't able to, but they tried. And that, it seems to us,
is the significant thing.

But this has foreclosed them, irrevocably.
out.

They can't sell.

They're

As 1 said, there's no more hope of

their selling to Ford now1’ than there is of selling to
General Motors.
Q

Well, is that necessarily so?

Suppose,

hypothetically, -that Champion now came up with a plug that
they could sell for three cents.

Wouldn't that give them -the

possibility of getting back into Ford?
MR. FRIEDMANt

It's unlikely, Mr. Justice, because

Ford is now —
Q

Well, who buys for six cents whan they can buy

49
for three cents?
X was testing

Xt*.s just

a very strong supposition, but

your absolute statement.

ME. FRIEDMAN:

Well, but, as a practical matter, -

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, as a practical matter, the
Champion, now, Champion now, under ordinary circumstances, is
effectively foreclosed from selling to Ford,

Xi5 s

I mean

there’s no point in their even trying to sell to Ford.
And even though, conceivably, if they could come up
with some revolutionary new plug, maybe — I don't know what

would happen.

But X think in dealing with Section 7 we have

to consider, consider what is the impact at the time of the
acquisition on -the competitors.

Q

But, surely, the government has no interest

in

trying to make Champion bigger or make its position more
secure, has it?
ME. FRIEDMAN:

Certainly, certainly not.

What we're trying to do — what we’re trying to do, Mr. Chief
Justice, is to restore, restore to this market, as much as
we can, the conditions that existed before the acquisition
took place.

Q

Well, that would mean, with Champion, a more

dominant position that it’s in now, wouldn't it?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

No.

When X suggest restore, what

X mean by restore is not to restore the Champion-Ford
relationship, what I mean is to try to restore the situation

50
that existed before the acquisition, where you had only oneautomobile manufacturer engaged in manufacturing spark plugs,
and where you had the other two manufacturers existing as
customers for spark plug firms.

That's what we’re trying to do

to restore to the market a second independent- not affiliated
with an automobile manufacturer, a second independent manufactn
er of spark plugs.

To give this company a chance to build up

and to develop.
Now, let me, if 1 may,

Who supplies —■

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Pardon me?

Just before you start again, who supplies

American Motors, or do they make their own?
MR. FRIEDMANi
Q

Champion supplies American Motors.

100 percent?

MR. FRIEDMAN;

100 percent.

Now, at one point they

divided their business between, I think. Champion and
Autolite, when there was a merger of Nash and another company

in 1954.

And the testimony indicates they' .decided they

preferred Champion, and Champion supplies, "them, all of their
plugs now.

Q

Aid there's something in the record to the

effect that American — there is some risk that American Motors

that might present some problems under the Robi:as on-Patraan
Act if they discriminated -- that would he a nice question?
whether they could discriminate and sell them below cost.
Q

In any event? they now do get this?

MR. FRIEDMANs They now do get that? yes.
I'd like now briefly to turn to the question of the
appropriate relief in the case.
We think that in light of the violation found in
this case? only divestiture would he an appropriate and proper
remedy.
Q

what is divested? just the plant?

MR. FRIEDMAMs
Q

Just the plant and the name.

And the name.

But how about — I guess Ford

acquired a distribution system?
MS. FRIEDMAN: That's right. That is not divested.
Q

What did they acquire as a distribution system?

MR. FRIEDMAN%

They acquired soma sales people? they

acquired contracts with distributors? they acquired? if you
might call it? an introduction to the distributors *—
Q

And'-this divestiture of just the name and the

plant is open to a new company?
MR. FRIEDMANs

It'S to he a new company.

Q

Capitalised by whom?

ME. FRIEDMANS
Q

That's uncertain.

It's

But this company hasn't — isn't getting —

isn't taking over any of the distribution system that Ford
acquired?
MR. FRlEDMANs

No.

No.

No? the company isn't,

Ford continuas to have the distribution system that it acquired?
and.of course -chat also includes —
Q

Although it can't make spark plugs or sell under

the Ford name?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

But it will have

its distribution system, to enable it to distribute the
spark plugs that it will purchase during this period.
And of course? eventually? if Ford wishes to get into the
manufacturing business? Ford will then have the benefit of
this distribution system that it has built up over the past
ten yecurs.
0

Would ELTRA be an eligible purchaser of new

Fostoria?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would suppose so.

I hesitate to

commit myself on that? because it might require a fairly
careful examination of all the circumstances in the industry,
and 1 just would bo reluctant to express an offhand opinion
on that,
~~

Q

As I understand it

ELTRA is what remains of the

original Auto .lite ?
MR. FRIEDMaH:

It5a what remains of the original

Autolite, plus a lot more.

ELTRA, since that time,, has

merged with a number of other companies —

But we*re just, talking of the single plant —
Q

What is meant by that plant being a fixad~output

54
plant?
MR. FRXBDMANs

The Foe; tori a plant?

Fixed-output plant is the fact; that it.ss a large
facility, and it needs to have a very substantial volume of
spark plug production, apparently, in order to r-vafee a go of it
economically.
It has the capacity of shout 175 million plugs a
year.

I don't, know how many it would have to have in order

to function.
Q

That’s a total sales volume of how much?

MR. FRIEDMANS
Q

Oh, I suppose —

$60 million?

MR. FRIEDMAN;

— 60, 70 million, something in that

range.
Now, we start, I think, with a basic proposition,
that the normal remedy for an acquisition that violates
Section ? is to undo the acquisition. That is, if it was illegal
for a firm to acquire another company, that the simple and most
effective remedy .is to require them to get rid of it.
In this© case there were two anti-competitive
effects that the District Court found, and of course, in
getting to questions of relief we must of course exhume the
correctness of tike findings.
And therefore what we had was two thingss

one, the

foreclosure of the sellers of spark plugs from the ten percent

share of the market that Champion was supplying to Ford, and
to the removal of these mediating or pro-competitive effects
■that resulted in Ford's remaining on the sidelines while it
was purchasing from Champion.
and it seems to us that the only effective way we
can remedy those violations is to restore as much as we can
the situation that existed.

That is, to have once again Fori­

as a customer, not manufacturing, sitting on the sidelines,
exerting the pro-competitive influence.
Q

Well, sitting on the sidelines . as a potential

And even at the time — even at the time while this is going

You will

Well, unless. ELT'RA does purchase it.

MR. FRIEDMaNs

Unless ELT'RA does purchase it.

But even if EUPEA purchases it, you will have a very different
market than you had.

You have a market comparable to what

you had before, not exactlys but you’d have a. comparable marks
with two significant independent spark plug manufacturers, and
only one of the Big Three automobile companies engaged in
the manufacture of spark plugs.
The

our economist indicated that tie only real

hope of ultimately achieving deconcentration in this market,
and I just pause to point out that in a market of this type,
an oligopolistic, very tightly structured market, with high
barriers to entry and no price competition, it*3 vital that
we do everything in the hope of procuring the deconcentration»
Every step that may load to da concentration that will lead ~
may lead to more vigorous competition, should be

incurred.

The only hope of any real deconcentration in this
market is breaking the OS tie.

That is, trying to persuade

the automobile mechanics that really they don’t have to use

57
the original equipment plugs.
Now.. Mr. Seymour ^suggested that while you have these
all-purpose plugs, they’re really not quite as good.

The

average service station or garage has charts which show
substitutability of plugs,

and it’s rather interesting that

Ford’s own witness testified that he recognised that the
plugs that Ford makes, the all-purpose — they all make, all
three of them, Champion, Ford, arid General Motors, that is,
Autolite, make all-purpose plugs.
And he testified, he said, well, he

ehphght that

the Ford plugs would do just as good a job as the Champion
and the AC plugs that were original equipment, in Chrysler
and General Motors cars, and he was asked, and he said,
I suppose you’d have to .acknowledge that the Champion and
AC plugs that are a substitute for your plugs will do just as
well? and he said, well, yes.
Evidence, for example, shows that Ford was much
elated when they discovered a few years ago that, at some
trials, automotive trials down in Florida, all the people who
were driving the stock Pontiac automobiles were using Electric
Autolite spark plugs.

They said;

This just shows hew good

our plugs are.
And the indication is that the real hope, -the real
hope of any deconcentration in this market is to break the.
OE tie and to persuade people that they don't have to buy the

so
original equipment: plug, that, the other plug will do.

if
And. of cour.se/there*s going to be an .automobile
manufacturer owning a spark plug firm, it’s going to be much
less likely to be pushing the sales of the private brands in
the after-market than an independent who was — particularly
this independent, the divested company, that knows its
ultimate future may depend on success in penetrating into the
after-market»
'Mow, Ford complains about the requirement that, it
purchase this half of its needs from Autolite, because it
says, This is going to cause all sorts of problems in terns of
pollution control, that %m won’t have adequate control over
the quality of the plugs, and this is going to be very un­
fortunates that we can do a much better job ourselves.
Well, first of all, the decree says that Ford in
purchasing the half of its requirements from Autolite, under
Autolite *s name, that the product must conform to Ford’s
designs, specifications, quality standards, and delivery
requirements, and to be priced competitively.
So that Ford is protected because the decree does
guarantee it, and then the requirements are; contingent on the
plugs meeting those, standards.
Moreover, as I have indicated, the divested company
would be under very great pressure to satisfy Ford, both in the
hope of getting more than 50 percent of the business and in the

59
hope of retaining that business after the five years,,
Q

But if all Ford could do about it, if the plugs
t, is to try to buy them from somebody

didn’t coj

They wouldn’t, be free to make them themselves, I guess?
MR. FRIEDMAN: They would not be free bo make them
themselves, but it seems, Mr. Justice, realist!cally,
considering the nature of the relationship, I’m sure that the
divested company is going to do everything it can to meet
Ford’s standards.
q

But just assuming that that’s true, are you

suggesting that that’s just as good as having either
General Motors or itself or Ford or Chrysler, or those
companies, to make and completely control their own develop­
ment and design and manufacture and research?
I

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think — the record shows

there’s vary close collaboration between the independent spark
plug manufacturers;prior, for example, to the acquisition
Ford, worked very closely with Champion, and they worked close
together.

It seems that Ford, for 50 years, was fully

satisfied with the product it was getting from Champion.
Even today Chrysler

has not, thus far, attempted to

integrate, and there’s no indication that Chrysler is not
getting satisfactory quality, and there is not — no
indication that Chrysler is not able to — If X may, Mr.
Justice, I’d like to just close with one thought, if X may,

60
which is on the question of the use of Ford’s own trade name
on plugs.
Ford makes the point that this is a harsh remedy,
that it’s a penalty,, that it’s unfair, that it’s unnecessary,
and they say this goes far beyond anything that’s ever
happened.here, because even prior to the acquisition Ford
was perfectly free at any time to manufacture under its own
trade narae, and now it is precluded.
And I think the answer to this intention is something
that this Court stated some years ago in Federal Trade
Commission v. national Lead Company, in 332 U.S.

And when the

complaint was there made that a decree subjected the defendants
to very strict strictures and was unfair, the Court said that
those caught violating the Act must expect soma fencing in.
I think Ford here has violated the Act through this
acquisition, and it, too, must except some fencing in.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Friedman.
Mr. Seymour.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WHITNEY NORTH SEYMOUR, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. SEYMOUR:

I would just take a moment or two.

In the colloquy there developed the basic question:
Did this acquisition substantially less competition, or have
the probability of doing so?

I submit that it’s amply clear that not only did it
not lessen competition or eliminate any competitors, it added
competition, it aided comp etition, it promoted competition.

Mi d what Mr. Friedman has told Your Honors points that out.
Chrysler and Champion are in a more competitive
relationship than "when Champion didn’t have to scrounge for
business.

Champion is also in the after-market — in the

private brand market.

EXTRA, which is the fourth company

in the business, and if this divestiture cook place there
would still only be four. There wouldn’t be a new company
because new Fostoria would just take -the place of Ford as a
supplier.
But the result of this acquisition was to create a
fourth competitor, and that’s EXTRA, which is active in the
private brand market, where it’s competing actively with
Champion, still the biggest company in the business, or having
the largest part of the business.
And ELTRA sales, the last figures in the record, were
1? million plugs.

Now, that isn’t very much compared with the

sales of General Motors and others, but it’s coming up.
ELTRA5 s president testified that he expected the market, by
1980, to be around 150 million plug ;.

This is a contribution

to comp© t i ti on.
Now, let me ex plain the way this private brand
market works, as X understand it in connection with automobiles.

f- 7

The mass merchandisers have put in repair bays in
many of their retail outlets in. the suburbs and so on» anci
you come in to shop at Sears » Roebuck» you puil your oar .*.«
there and get them to tune it up» and unless you tei.1 dis^. uP.at
what you want is an AC plug» what they

6.0

is to put .in a. oea.iS

plug.
And so tills business of overcoming the OB tie by
direction of the guy that runs the station is what happens in
connection with these private brand sales» and apparently
it*s happening on enough of a scale so that , it's getting to be
a more significant part of the market.
Now, I submit •that this was a pro-“competitive
activity.

If that’s so t that ends the case? and the judge had

to struggle so hard to get away from that inference» and X
must say it was clearer in 1969 than it was whan the government
brought the suit.

In 1961 it might have looked less proi

competitive than it turned out to be. But the judge had to
really take this concept of being on the edge of the market»
but h© transposed the notion of being on the edge of the
market from your potential competition decisions to a mare
customer status» where»
K

1

submit» it doesn't have any place.

customer is always on the edge of the market.

But he-s

not on the edge of the market as one anxiously waiting to come
in, which is what your cases deal with.
My learned friend has said that Champion was quite a

loss to business, people were nibbling at i
-'shewed no signs of concern.

h .it Champion

The testimony, including the

testimony quoted in our reply brief, shows that Champion
■wasn’t worried about it.

It felt that it would go on forever

just the way it had bean.
And Chrysler had some inquiries. But nobody ever
made a fold to Chrysler, and so when you talk, or when the
judge talks about the terrible thing being the denial of the
opportunity to try, -this is really, just as I said before, a
charade.

It isn't a real effort, because it isn't really open

to people to come in and make the sacrifice involved in
selling below cost and waiting eight years to develop the
market.
Now, finally, it's clear from counsel's argument,
I think, and 2 think from the opinion on relief, that the
court below really was concerned about the OB tie, and was
trying to find a way to break it. And that he thought that
with divestiture and holding Ford's head under water with
these injunctions, maybe something would happen to break the
tie.
But, quite aside from the fact that that was a
judicial experiment, which is beyond, I should submit, the
ordinary activities proper under the statute, there is no
prospect of breaking it that way.
is by

competition.

The prospec t of breaking it

Competition was encouraged by this trans-

64
action.
And just one word on the

:

Counsel says it took ten years to get the judgment
in this case# and therefore Ford should be banned for ten years
from entering the market,
1 submit that that doesn't follow at all* and that to
foe banned at all from entering the market is anti-competitive,
and there's no basis for it.
As far as Ford’s name is concerned, tc deny it an
opportunity, to delay the basis for ultimata entry in the
market fox' many, many years by preventing it from letting its
name be connected with spark plugs made toy others is quit®,
quite wrong.
Aside from everything else, those injunctions were
excessive beyond, I think, any proper exercise of the court's
discretion.
But, basically, my view is that this was a procompetitive acquisition, and the judgment should be reversed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, .Mr. Seymour.
Thank you, Mr. Friedman.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:44 a.m., the case was submitted.)
