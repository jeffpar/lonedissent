We will hear arguments

in No, 61, Securities end Exchange Commission against the
Medical Committee for Human Rights,
Mr, Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF TEE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:

May it pleas© the Courts

This case comes here on & writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit.

It arises under Section 14(a) of the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934 relating to proxy solicitation, and vzMx
the regulations under that Act? and it raises questions of
the reviewability of action or nonaction of the Commission with
respect to proxy materials.
The text of Section 14(a) is printed on page 49 of
tii© Commission's brief.

It makes it unlawful to use the

facilities of the mails or of interstate commerce or of an
exchange in contravention of such rules and regulations as the
Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriates in the
public interest or for the protection of investors to solicit
or permit the us© of his name to solicit any proxy or consent
with respect to any security*
But that is simply a delegation to the Commission to
mate rules with respect to proxies in the public interest or

4
for fcha protection of investors*
And at this point I would also 1:11?.© to bring to fcha
Court as attention Section 21(e) of the Securities: Exchange
Act of * 34, which is also printed on page 49 of fcha government’s
brief, which authorizes the Commission, whenever it appears
that there is © violation of the Act or about to be a violation
of -the Act, it may in its discretion bring an action in the
appropriate United States District Court.
Finally, X would call attention to the regulations
which the Commission has made under Section 14(a), specifically
those relating to proposals of security holders, which it;
Rule 14(a)”8 of -the Commission's rules? that: is rather long,
but it is set out in full on page 51 to 55 of the Commission's
brief.
With this as the legal setting, 1 turn to the facte.
The respondent her® is the Medical Committee on Human
Rights.

The record does not show whether it is a corporation

or a voluntary association, nor does it show how the committee
is made up, or how its spokesmen are authorized.
The record does show that early in 1968 it acquired,
by gift, five shares of the common stock of Dow Chemical
corporation, a Delaware corporation.
Even before the shares were registered in its name,
it made a request on the company to include a proposal in its
proxy material for th© 1968 annual meeting of Dow.

That

request related to the sal© of napalm by Dow*

But it cams too

late for action at the 1968 masting.
Early in 1969 the Medical Committee >senfc a new
request to Dow, asking that there to© submitted to the Dow
shareholders, in Dew’s proxy solicitation for the 1969 annual
moating, a proposal requesting that the company's charier be
amended with respect to the sale of napalm.
That appears on pages 10 and 12 of fch© appendix.
On the advice of its general counsel, Dow decided to
omit the proposal.

In accordance with Rule 14(a)-8(d) , Dow

notified both the Committee and the Commission of its decision,
stating its reasons and including an opinion of counsel sr
required by the rule.
The Committee then modified its proposal so ths.t it
would propose a resolution which would amend the company's
by-laws so as to prohibit the manufacture of napalm, and asked
the Commission staff to review the matter.

On February 18th, 1969, the Commission’s staff
informed the committee and Dow that it would not recommend any
action to the Commission if the proposal was omitted from
Dow’s proxy material.
The Committee's counsel than asked that 'the Commission
itself review the staff’s position.

And on March 24th, 1969,

the Commission, as shown by its minuta book, quote, "determined
to raise no objection fco the omission from the management’s

6
proxy statement of certain resolutions proposed by fchra Medical
Committee for Human Eights»**
Now, I would suggest this is a little like a denial

of writ of certiorari by this Court,» which amounts

a rt,ele­

ment that this Court will take no action with respect fee? a
decision below and is not in any way a decision by this Court

&& to the merits of the case»
On May 29th, 66 days after the Commission's no-action
determination, the Committee filed a petition for review of tha
Commission’s action in the United States Court, of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, and this brings us to r
threshold difficulty with the case.
The statute under which this proceeding was brought,
Section 25(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, printed on page
50 of the Commission’s brief, provides that a petition for
review may b© filed "within 60 days after the entry of such
order"*
Q

Mr, Solicitor General, I’m curious.

This is

brought up only in the Reply Brief, is it not?
MR. GRISWOLDs

It was re-ferred to in the main brief.

1 suggest that it i": jurisdictional, and I simply want to submit
it for the Court’s consideration on that basis.

It is certainly

novel to say that as order is not entered until written notice
of it is given,

Here notice was given by telephone on the

day the order was entered.

There is no requirement with respect

?
to tills Court's judgment or with respect to the judgments that
this Court reviews, that th® date of entry of the order, and,
after all, that’s what Congress said was the entry of the
order, is deferred until written notice is given, and if it
is jurisdictional, it seems to at© appropriate that I should lay
it before the Court for its consideration.
But assuming that there is jurisdiction, we com© to
tli® questions of administrative law which have been briefed by
tli© partias.

Thase are discussed at length in the principal

briefs which have been filed.

The argument can become rather

extensive and complex, and this has been developed fully, and
I hop® carefully, in our briefs.

X hope, for th© convenience

of th® Court.
In tills oral argument X want to try to focus on two
aspects which seem to m© to be of particular importance.

The

real controversy underlying tills case is between the Medical.
Committee and Bov? chemical Company.

Yet, Bow is not a party

hare, and will not be bound by the decision of tills Court.
Th® Commission has no machinery to adjudicat® proxy
disputes.

Nor could it, as.a practical matter, adjudicate such

disputes within the very short time available during the proxy
season.

Actually, th® Commission's staff reviews something

like 5,000 sets of proxy.material per year, mostly within a
period of three months, in fcha early part of the year,
Necessarily, th.® work is largely done by the staff

8
of the Commission.

Ifc is truly a matter of administration.

1 think it fair to say that the Securities and Exchange
Commission has & relatively high reputation for the quality of
its work, and it may well be because of the capacity it has
shown to develop these administrative activities within the
framework of its establishment.
Only a few matters can be referred to the Commission
itself.

Neither the staff nor the Commission has power to issue

any orders with respect to proxy.

Nor can the Court of Appeals

below direct the Commission to take any affirmative action
with respect to proxy matters.

By the vary terms of the statute,

that is committed to the Commission “in its discretion5'.
All that the Court of Appeals has purported to do here
is to require the Commission to make © statement with raopect
to a question of law which would not necessarily control the
Commission's action.

Indeed, the Medical Committes now urges

in its brief, at page 21 that its petition for review sought
to review only “the legal determination * that it presumes the
Commission mad© when it declined to institute an enforcement
action.
And that, I think, is a little bit like asking this
Court to certify what its view was as to the merits of a case,
when it denied — denies certiorari.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, would i t make any

difference if the parties could go to the Bis fcrict Court and

ask for an injunction?
ME. GRISWOLDs
Q

That “*~

Or do you think they could?

ME. GRISWOLDs

Well, that is the remedy, Mr* Justice.

The Medical Committee was entirely free to go to the District
Court and seek an order on Dow Chemical Company which co-id then
h® litigated with those two parties $ that, under Delaware law,
it was required to submit this and that under the proxy rules
of the Commission that it was required to submit these.
Q

So that their claim would be that the proxy

material was not adequate?
MR. GRISWOLD; Whose claim would be?
Q
Court.

The Medical Committee, if it. went to the District

They would claim that the proxy material was not

adequate.
MR. GRISWOLDs

The Medical Committee’s claim would

be that the proxy material was adequate and was required to be
submitted to the shareholders.
Q

Wall, I mean the proxy that was sent out, or —

MR. GRISWOLD;

That tbs proxy that Dow had sent out

was not adequate? yes, Mr. Justice.
Q

But in the sense that it didn’t disclose what

it -should have disclosed?
MR. GRISWOLD; And that would raise the questions under
both State law and 'under the proxy rules, which would fe© subject

to consideration by the Court and another remedy available to
the Medical Committe® is to send out its own prosy materials,
at its own expense; a large part of the problem here is simply
who's going to pay for it.
The Medical Committee is entitled, under the proxy
rules, to get a list of the shareholders and to mail out its
own proxy material and get its proxies and present them and
vote them at the meeting, and no one raises any question:

tboui.

•} •:

that..
Q

So the government isn't contending that the

Committee doesn't have standing or doesn't have a case of
controversy with Dow under the statute, nor that there wouldn't
be a federal question in District Court?
MR. GRISWOLD: There may well foe a case of controversy
with Dow, but it isn't here, because —Q

Yes..

MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

— Dow isn't in this case.

So it's a question of which court should it be

in, and it’s a question of reviewability?
MR. GRISWOLD:

It is in part whether the remedy lies

in tii© District Court, as provided in the statute, or, to put
the same thing another way, whether it is appropriate for the
Court, of Appeals to seek to review something or other here,
under a petition for review under Section 25(a).
What the Medical Committee now seeks is a declaration,

u
unrelated to relief, and to the only justiciable controversy
that has aver existed in this matter, that is between ths
Medical Committee and Dow.
Now, the only place where the Medical committee can
get that relief is in the State courts of Delaware or in ths
appropriate district court undor Section 27.,
Q

Wall# does the SEC regulations or procedure?

provide for securing any kind of declaratory relief?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Provide for — X*m ecrxy, Mr. Justice?

For getting any kind of declaratory r@li©ff?

MR. GRISWOLD:

Non® whatever, Mr. Justice# tvh ■, X

know of.
Q

There is no way that Dow, for example, can come

in and say, Wa want a declaratory order as t© the adequacy of.

proxy ~~
MR. GRISWOLD:

X suppose Dow could com© in, but the

Commission could properly dismiss that on the ground that
there's no provision in the statute for such © procedure.
Q

had there's nothing in the regulations which

would “~
MR* GRISWOLD:

Nothing in the regulations which

would authorise that.
Now, let ms go on to show the attenuated nature of
the Medical Committee's position, which I think is shown very
clearly by these facts *

12
Tm proposal was initially submitted for the annual

ma@ti.ug of Dow in May 1969,

That meeting was held two and s-

half years ago, prior to feh® filing of the petition for review.
And, second, subsequent to the filing of the petition

for Kdview, Dow
Does not now
do

ceased to manufacture napalm for the government»

manufacture it and

has

no plans for continuing to

so.
And, third, finally Dow did include th© Medical

Committal's resolution in Dow's proxy statement for its annual
meeting in May 1971»

Th® proposal received leas than three

percent of the vote of all th© shareholders.
Under Hula 14(a)~S(c)(4)(i) of the prosy rules, Dew
may exclude this 'proposal from its proxy materials for the*
next three calendar years.

Thus the issue cannot arise again

until 1975.
The question whether the Medical Committee will make
similar proposals at that time, and how Dow will treat them;
are entirely speculative,
\

Thus the Medical Committee has obtained everything
it sought in this litigation.

That Is, th© distribution'of its

proposal by Dow at Dow's expense, to enable the security
holders to vote on it.

All that it seeks now is a declaration

that it was entitled to get what it has already received,
And giving such a declaration after the ©vent is not the proper
function ©£ federal courts in our constitutional system.

13
Ev>m if there were & live controversy remaining hero,
the judgment of the court below would be wrong in our submissione
The basic question it* one of separation of powers or, more*
accurately, of allocation of powers.

W@ submit that the

administration of the proxy regulations is a matter which
Congress has committed po the administrative process without
provision for, or expectation of, judicial review as fco the
admini8trative action.
Not all issues arising in our governmental operation
have to be decided by courts,

tod where the problem is really

one of administration, Congress may well choose to allocate it
for administrative handling.

It remains, of course, subject to

th© continued review of Congress, through changes in tho
applicabis statute, a review which Congress has never found it
necessary to exercise in this area over more then 35 years.
That Congress deliberately decided to allocate this
matter to administrative handling without court review is, I
submit, shown by the language which Congress used in the
statute.

Section 14(a) of the Act laid down no rules, I

repeat, laid down no rules with respect to proxies.
it allocated the area to the Commission,

Instead

congress mad© it.

.illegal to us© the facilities of interstate commerce fco
solicit proxies contrary to "such rule© and regulations os
the Commission may prescribe".
The rules are the Commission's, by a complete

14
delegation and clearly intended allocation by Congress.
In an area so amorphous it seems reasonably clear that Congress
allocated to .the Commission not only the making of the rules;
and regulations, but also the function of determining their
administration md their enforcement in concrete cases»
Q

Well, this sounds as though, Mr. Solicitor

General, you would think that in allocating this job t© tha
Commission that Congress didn’t intend any party to have a
cause of action in the District Court
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Mo, Mr. Justice, not at all.

All right.

MR. GRISWOLD; The cause of action in the District
Court remains, but it is in no sense a review of the Commissiontaction.
Q

All right.

Thank you.

MR. GRISWOLD: And the cat©© of action in the District
Court is largely based on State law, and Congress

wsg

deliberately not enacting a federal corporation law, it was
deliberately leaving these, the underlying problems her®, to
the laws of the states,

congress was simply taking action

to provide for the protection of investors, and assigning to
the Commission the function of seeing to it that appropriate
step.® war© taken for the protection of investors.
Q

So you’re suggesting, then, that if the Medical

Committee could have gone t© the District Court, it wouldn't

15
have been going there under the federal question jurisdiction.
And it. could

not

assert a cause

o£

action under th© federal

statute.
MR, GRISWOLDs

On fch© contrary? Mr. Justice, I think

the Medical Committee had two choices»

It could hava goto into

the Delaware Stats courts as a matter of state law, staking
no reference to the federal statuto.
On the other hand, it could have gone into th©
appropriate District Court, which I assume is Delaware, but

X

haven't checked that, relying on th© proxy rules of the

Commission and also on the state law, in which case the
statute provides that the District Court shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to enforce these provisions.
Q

And their claim would be that under federal law

the proxy that's sent out must be adequate?

Is that it?

MR. GRISWOLDs That would bs the claim, yes.

But

they are — what we're really saying is that they sr© not
entitled to have the support* of the Commission in that-suit.
Q

Well, what if Dow had completely ignored the

had never submitted anything to th© Commission and purported
— although there had been submissions to it by the Medical
Committee, end they started to send out the proxies»

2 suppose

th© M@dical Committee, under — could go into the District
Court and say the procedures haven't been complied with?
MR. GRISWOLDs

The Medical Committee could itself

16
iS'u&i and X would think that under those ciraumstancos it would
bs very likely that th© Commission would pick up the ball and.
carry it itself and bring the suit, with the Medical Committee
perhaps as a party.
Q

Do you think the Commission has authority to

g© iato court for an injunction to enjoin the inadequate

proxies —»
MR, GRISWOLD:
Q

Oh, there isn't th© slightest

There's no question about that?

MR, grxswold2 There isn't the slighted doubt of
that, Section 25 provides that the Commission "in its discretion1'3
may bring a suit to enforce th© statute —
q

y©s.

MR, GRISWOLD:
Q

~~ or the regulation.

But X —

Could X — excuse me, did I interrupt you?

MR. GRISWOLD?

Well, all I'm saying is X don't think

that the Commission is under any obligation to bring such a
suit if, in its discretion, it thinks it should not.
Q

2 think X detected in Mr. Justice White's

question something ©f the case where the Commission was asked
to exercise its discretion m& declined to do anything.

What

would be the remedy if they paid no attention to a request?
MR. GRISWOLDs The remedy would b® to bring © suit
in 'the United States — for the Medical Committe© to bring a
suit in the United' States District Court.

Q

To require them to exorcise ~~

To require Dow t© comply with

Q

require it to exercise its statutory duty* its discretionary
duty?
MR. GRISWOLD:
Justice.

I was — you changed# Mr. Chief

There is no statutory duty.

Thera is a duty to

There isn't the slightest doubt that

it did exercise its discretion her®, adversely.
Q
to do anything.

Well, s was assuming

&

case where it refused

It did not. exercise its discretion at ull,

HE. GRISWOLDt

Well, that would be another cass#

Mr. Chief Justice, if the Commission refused to do anything *
That would be an extraordinarily negative-negative order, I
suppose.

But might be# might, conceivably be subject to

review as an utter abuse of discretion.
There*® no suggestion her© that anything of that sort
occurred.
If all questions under the proxy rules are subject to
review by the Courts, then they must fo© handled differently,
as I've already said they axe vary numerous.

If they're

subject fc© review, there must foe a thorough record, thar® must

b®

reasoned opinions# there must be © clear opportunity for

10
intra-Commi s si on review, for all of which there is no tin©.
I think it was Emerson who said that th© central tragedy of
life is that there are only 24 hours in a day.
Congress may wall have thought it hatter for th®
whole matter to bo handled by th® administrative process,
without judicial review.
And support for this is found in other provisions
of the statute.
in 14(a).

The allocation of th© are® to the Commission

It's found in the fact that Congress mad® no

provision for any order by the Commission in th© area.

And

it's found, finally, that it expressly allocated th® enforce­
ment of these provisions to the Commission in its discretion.
There is no provision that this essentially
administrative determination shall be made by the courts, or
even that the court shall have power to review th® Commission's
action or inaction, unless it shall appear to the Commission
that there is about to b® a violation, and the Commission, in
its discretion, brings an action in the proper court.
W© think that this comes within the —• well within
the language which th© Court used in the case of Schilling^
Rogers in 363 tf.s., cited on pages 39 and 40, of our brief.
Thar© are many reasons why th© Commission might
conclude that it would take no action, not every case taken to
a court will foe: decided by that court, as is ©vident in this
Court's certiorari jurisdiction.

Another Analogy that naturaliy occurred to m*j ie
that not every cas© can ba taken to a court, even though there
siay be a basis for thinking the decision is wrong and that
there should be review, as is evident in the function of fch©
Solicitor General to decide what cases to appeal and what
cases to bring to this Court on petition for certiorari.
These are discretionary functions, end it would be
hard to give a consistently reasoned justification for every
decision which frequently turns on other considerations than
fch© merits of the case, and there would not be time to give
such reasons if, for some reason, it was thought that it had
to be don®«
All of this, it seems to me, is nicely exemplified
in the present case.

Th® Court of Appeals was not in a

position to vindicate any right of the Medical Committee«
That can be con© only in a District Court, in an action to
enforce compliance with th© proxy rules.

The Court of Appeals

cannot order the Commission to seek enforcement.

There is

no provision for such a mandatory order in Section 25(a),
and fch© decision to seek ©nforcomant has been expressly
committed by Congress feo th© discretion of the Commission.
All that the Court of Appeals can do in this css© is
to express its view of th® law applicable fc© a controversy
between the Medical Committee and Dow that has not bean
presented by those parties for th© court’s consideration•

And

20
the decision of the Court of Appeals will not be binding on
the District Court if the Medical Committee soaks to on fore®
there its rights as a shareholder# if for no other reason than
that Dow is not a party before

the Court of Appeals# and is

not in any way bound by its decision.
Thus the present procedural posture of the case shows
clearly enough that the only and to which it can coma is an
advisory ©pinion by the tjourt below on a matter a a to which
the court can require no action to be taken and which is on®
that Congress has expressly allocated for good reason# for
handling by the administrative procsss and not by the courts.
And fch© judgment should be reversed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTS B. OWEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. OWENs

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please the

Courts
1 went to get fee- th© merits of the issue presented
for decision here as quickly as X can# but 2 think X should
deal with on© issue at th© outset# an issue which was
belatedly raised by the government# and which I -think desarvas
immediate attention.
Th© Court will recall that in the petition for

22
certiorari the government affirmatively took the position that
tills ease presented an important justiciable controversy which
deserved resolution here.
They affirmatively argued in those papers that ©van
if Dow Chemical Company should ultimately include our share­
holder propose! in the proxy material, and even if that
proposal should thus reach the shareholders and be rejected by
those shareholders, nevertheless, this case would not bo moot,
tod they affirmateXy argued, we think correctly, that the case
involved a continuing controversy between the Medical ccrsaltteo
and the

sec»

Now, in those certiorari papers they cited two
decisions of tills Court, to the effect that where, you have a
continuing controversy of this kind, the Court should go forward
and decide the question on its merits«

We agree that those

oases are controlling, and we rely upon them,
Now, against that background, both the government's
main brief on the m@ri.ts and our main brieff on the merit®
were directed exclusively to the merits of the controversy,
that is, to til® issue of administrative reviewability; we did
not discuss the>Mougios point, we didn't hay© an opportunity
fee do s®.
But five days ago, when the government filed their
reply brief, they changed their position, and suggested, for
the first time, that the controversy we have her® is in fact an

2?
abstract academic dispute*

They suggest that the action of the

Commission in this case vme without the practical consequences
which ara necessary to render the question justiciable*
And 2 think that if I can take just a jsoananfe to
describe hew the Securitas and Exchange Commission actually
handles shareholder disputes of this kind, I can show that
what w® have here is a hard, live, continuing controversy
between these parties, so that a judicial resolution of the
issue is entirely appropriate*
Now, in discussing what actually happens in the
Commission proceedings, I am going to be emphasising substance
and not form»

In a series of decisions of this Court, th®

Court has mad© clear that the appropriateness of judicial
review of administrative action depends on the real!tier; of
what the agency does and not on th© labels which th® agency
appends to it.

And that is th® spirit in which, I think, this

case has to be approached*
Mow, what we're talking about her® is a very
specific, narrow, factual situation.

This 1® a situation where

a shareholder of & company has submitted a written proposal
to the company and requested the company to include the
proposal in its proxy materials pursuant to SEC proxy Rule
14(a)"8*

That rule provides that, prima facie, ©very such

proposal mush bm included in th© proxy material© so that ths
shareholder® can ultimately considar it.

23
Th© rule goes on to provide certain, exemptions und&r
which a specific proposal may be excluded.
Now, we're talking about a situation here where the
shareholder has submitted his proposal to -the company, and
said, I want it included under the general rule requiring
inclusion *
And th® Commission or — I'm sorry, the company soys
in response, No, it falls within one of the exceptions in the
proxy rules, and it need not, as a matter of law, ho included
in ©nr proxy materials, and therefore w® do not propose to
include it.
Now, at that point you, of course, have a concrete
dispute between the shareholder and the company.
happen© next is this:

And what

The Commission rules require that that

dispute between -the shareholder and the company be brought
before the agency for its review.
We recognise, of course, that the Commission did not
have to promulgate the rules, saying that the parties must
bring the suit, the dispute before the agency.
has promulgated that rule.

But the agency

Neither the company nor the share­

holder can avoid having their dispute brought before the
agency.

Both of them have to submit, therefor®, to agency

review of their problems.
Now, specifically, the rules require that the
shareholder's proposal and supporting papers must be sent to

24
tts SBC# and th© company must also furnish the agency witha
statement of its position# and it must also serve those papers
on the shareholders# so the shareholder will know what hcs

happened»
Q

Could fch® company just ignore that# in the

s©ns© of defaulting?

25

absurd or valid it may bs, they hold it up ©gainst fcfe©
Commission '3 proxy rules, which say that certain kinds of
proposals must h© included and certain may foe excluded.

They

make a legal determination for themselves, whether they must
include or not, and they make a decision then when ttray will
or will not include.

Nov;, of course; if they agree to include It* they8ve
don© exactly what the shareholder wanted, and that's the end
of the matter.

No disputa.

If they decide to exclude it, then they must report
that decision to the Commission, and that triggers the
administrative procos® which X*m about to describe.
Now, let me make clear what tho nature of thesn
disputes is.

I think I've already gotten to the core of it.

We have on® factual survey, which bus bean made of what
happen© in the Commission, whan these disputes ar© brought
before it under the rules.

Thor© is a gentleman named Mr.

Clusserath, who spent several years in the SEC5s Division of
Corporation Finance, and h® actually surveyed th© papers that
are submitted to the Commission, and he surveyed what fcha
Commission did with those papers.

And he's reported the facts

in a publication upon which both sides rely in this case.
a© makes very clear from his survey that virtually
©very dispute, as framed between fch© shareholder and the
company, and which comes before the agency, is a pur® dispute of

26
law.

Just a disagreement as to the msming of th© proxy rules.
The company is arguing the proposal falls within one

of the exceptions, which allows us to exclude th© proposal?
and the shareholder is saying, no, we com© within tha general
rule and not within th© exceptions.

The proxy rules requires

the inclusion of our proposal.
Wow, th©. Court, X hope, will bear in mind that during
the agency proceeding, under the agency's rules, th© company
has the burden of persuasion on that issue,

it is the

principle in the agency that all doubts must be resolved in
favor of tii© shareholder, which is fee say, in favor of
inclusion of th© proposal in the proxy material.
Wow, when 'the legal issue has been posed by the two
parties to this dispute before the agency, it is first taken
under consideration by the staff, that is th© Division of
Corporation Finance.
determinations

And what the division does is make a legal

whether the proposal must be included oi whether

it may b© excluded tinder on® of th© exceptions.
In this case, for example, tha Division of Corpora­
tion Finance flatly ruled, as a matter ©f law,.and it's written
down in th© record, that Dow's legal position was correct,
and tost the shareholder's contentions of the law ware wrong.
Th© Division then notified both parties that they
had decided in favor of 'th© company cn trm legal issue.

And

they went on to say, in their letter, that in view of that

legal determination, they would not recommemd any action
against, the company, if the proposal were excluded from tho
proxy material*

Q

That, then, still leaves the option up to the

company, does it not?
MR. OWENs Th© company is still fra© to include or
exclude*

As a matter ©£ practice, it always excludesj once

it has been notified by the agency that the agency is not going
to take any action.
I will come.-back to that in a moment and show that
when it is in the reverse situation, the company always accepta
the proposal and includes it in its proxy material.
Now, following the staff’s determination as to this
legal issue, the losing party may, if he wishes, ask for the
full five-man commission to review the staff's .resolution of
the legal issue? and, as a matter of practice, when requested
t© do so, the Commission does review the staff’s action.
1 might, add, incidentally, that written legal
argument is submitted fc© the Commission by both sides, if they
want to.

That’s what happened in this case.

Dow presented, if

you will, a brief to the Commission and said, Wo. think we're
right on the law, end we can exclude?the shareholder responded
with written legal argument and said, ft© think Dow's wrong on
the law, via think they are required as a matter of law to
include our proposal in the proxy material.

28
Sc cow 1 com© to the vital question in th® case,
which is s What does th® Commission actually do in a disputes si
this kind?
Now, th© fact is that in practice th® Commission
actually docides the proper legal issue on its merits.

it

takes the shareholder proposal, which is involved, it in''Ids
it up against th® very precis® legal standards which ar®
written out in the Commission9ts own rulee, end it decides? th©
legal status,

if you

will, of that particular proposal*

And if you look at page 25 of the government’s main
brief, you will see confirmed the fact by a former Chairman
of the Commission fchfc they decide the status of th® proposal
under the proxy rules.

An essentially legal determination.

I might add that in Mr. Clusserath’s survey of
this whole situation, he recites decision after decision after
decision by th® Commission on th© marita of the legal issue
presented.

He doesn’t identify

a single case in which the-

Commission did not decide the legal issue on its merits,
r

'I

the government here has not cited a single
situation in which th©’ Commission did not decide that question
on its merits.
And thus far, I might add, there have, be©» five
courts that have considered such Commission action, and they
all treated it as a decision by the Commission on the merits
/

of th® legal issue presented.

29
Now, in tills case, the government, if X may say co,
focuses on form and not substance; they focus on the language
of the letter, which then cams out of the Commission aftr-r thsy
had resolved the issue against us.

Now, the language of the

letter was that they adopted the recommendation of tho Division
of Corporation Finance, and on that basis would taka nr, action
against Dow.
The emphasis that the government places hero is on
the no-action language, and they say, or they apoculat® that
possibly the Commission somehow bypassed the legal issun which
has been argued to it by the parties, and decided to take no
action against Dow without deciding that legal issue»
But I should emphasis© they are speculating only, as
to what the Commission may have done.

The government'in this

case has never come right out and asserted that the Commission
sidestepped the-legal issue.
And, in any event, it seems to m© that the sidestepping
speculation, if you will, is pretty unrealistic.

Obviously the

Commission is not going to decide whether or not to take
action against the company without first deciding whether the
company is right or the law or wrong on the law.

In fact,

as Mr. Clusserafch’s report makes clear, they always did decide
the legal issue; if they decide the company is wrong on the
law, they send the company & letter and say, We think you're
wrong, we think that the law, that, is the proxy rules, require

30
that you Include this proposal in your proxy material.
On fcii© other hand* if they dec-id© the company 1b
right on the law, they send out a no~actvion letter.
Now, 'feliat is what actually happens.
Now, 1st m& talk for a moment abbot the practical
impact upon th® parties, when © Commission decision has been
rendered.
Xn a case where the Commission decides that the
company is wrong on. the legal issue, a© a practical matter the
shareholder can relax, his worries are over.

Faced with that

decision by the commission, th® company knows it has two choices
it can ©ith®r bow to the Commission5s ruling on th® law and
include the proposal in its proxy material; or, on th© other
hand, it can ignore the Commission's ruling.

But if it does

so, it faces very sever# sanction.
In th© first place, in that situation, th© Commission
can institute an administrative proceeding, looking toward
delisting th® company's securities for violation of th® proxy
rule.
0

Isn't that discretionary with th© Commission?

MR. Owens

Entirely so, Mr. Justic©.

Yes»

I 'at not- saying that any on© of these sanctions must

be taken by feh© Commission, but the company knows they ®r©
at hazard, and they run this risk.
Now, on® risk is an administrative proceeding against

31
them for delisting of th® securities; another .is# in an
egregious case# possible criminal prosecution by the Attorney
General# at the request of the Commission.

But the most

likely# as a practical matter# is a civil suit by tha Commission
against th® company for injunctive relief to compel tha company
to include th© proposal in th© proxy material.
Q

Well, you're talking about practical facta ~~

HR. OWEN:

q

—

p£

Indeed.
th© way this works, and as a matter of

practical fact, if tha company does got that kind of word from
tii© Commission# it includes th© material, doesn't it?
MR. owkmi Absolutely correct, Mr. Justice,

in th©

entire history of the Securities Act there ha© only been ©no
company who ®v©r declined to abide by th® Commission*0
ruling.

That was Trans-America Corporation, they werepromptly

sued by tli® Commissioni they lost the case,
more than 20 years ago.

That was in IS47,

Mo company since that tins® has ever

defied th© Commission's ruling.
In other word©, no shareholder in history has ever
had to take any action to defend his rights, once the
Commission bass ruled in hi© favor on that issue.

And 1

suggest that, is entirely m it should be# on© of th© principal
responsibilities of th© SEC is to serve as the-, guardian of

How, 2 haw© discussed th® shareholder who wins before

32
th® Commissione, but compare bis situation with th® fellow who
loses.
If the Commission, let us assume erroneously, dsciefe-:
against the shareholder in this dispute, which they haws
brought, before themselves, then of course that shareholder has
been wronged, and he suffers a number of distinct -- in a
number of distinct practical ways.
In the first place, lie has been wrongfully deprived
of the Commission’s very effectivo help.
Secondly, if ha wants to vindicata his rights, fee.

He has no other choico.

That is invariably so.

That isn't true as to ICC review.

These

are many instances where District Courts haven't — albeit
three-judge District Courts — haven't given automatic

approval to an ICC ruling.
MR. OWENs

That la correct# and I suggest, Mr.

Justice, that there is a distinction between the situation where
the agency, of which complaint is made, is before the Courted
is arguing its case, and presenting its position.

In ©

situation ilka that, the Court is entirely competent to pass
on whatever feh© legal questions will be, or may be presented?
and no great weight, then, is going to be given to the
administrative interpretation of the law.
But the situation, I suggest, is otherwise, where
the Commission is not present.
