PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We’ll hear arguments next

in No. 70-72, United States against Charles Pfizer & Company,
and others.
Mr. Friedman, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
After a seven-week trial a jury, sitting in the
Southern District of New York, convicted the three respondents,
Charles Pfizer & Son, the American Cyanamid Company, and the
Bristol-Myers Company, under an indictment in three counts,
with violating Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, by fixing
prices and excluding competitors in a market known as broadspectrum antibiotic drugs.
Each of the respondents was fined the maximum of
$50,000 on each count; a total of $150,000 fine on each
respondent.
Broad-spectrum antibiotic druqs... are a group of drugs
that are unusual, they came in fairly recently, because they
.are effective against a wide variety of microbacterial
infections.
Each of the three respondents in this case, plus
another firm, Parke, Davis, that was not indicted, had a broad-

spectrum antibiotic drug during the period involved in this
case.

Each of these drugs was patented.

fairly well known.

Most of them are

One that Your Honors are nrobably familiar

with is something called Aueromycin, which is the drug of
Cyanamid,
The drug that is principally involved in this case,
the focus of this case, however, is the last of these broadspectrum antibiotics to come on the market, a drug called
tetracycline„
And the basic theory of the government's case in this
case was that the respondents, together with the Upjohn
Company and the Squibb Company, engaged in a conspiracy to
limit access to the broad-spectrum antibiotic market and to

fix prices on broad-spectrum antibiotics,,
A divided Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
reversed this conviction.

The court, held that certain errors

made by the District Court in its instructions to the jury
required a new trial.
And the government has brought, this case here on
certiorari because of its concern over the way the Court of
Appeals reviewed and evaluated the instructions in this case.
We think, as I shall develop, that the basic error committed
by the Court of Appeals in this case was in its failure to
view the instructions in their entirety, in the context of the

Q

Mre Friedman, are you asking this Court to simply

substitute its judgment for the Court of Appeals as a reviewing
court in the first instance?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Nof Mr» Justice, we think what we’re

suggesting •— we8 re asking this Court to hold that the Court
of Appeals employed the wrong standard in considering the valid.it
of this charge.

We are not asking this Court, of course, to

substitute its judgment for that of the Court of Appeals»
And the flaw we think that the Court

of Appeals

committed in this case was that it didn't look

at the thing in

the context,

it thoughtwere

it found particular phrases which

improper, it said that the judge had not stressed

certain

factors sufficiently, and had streesed others too much.

This

is the basic flaw we think that was committed, which I will
coxae to develop.
Nov?, there’s no question in this case, as the
Court of Appeals recognized, as to what happened. The problem
in tn.is case is as to what inferences should be drawn from the
circumstantial evidence.
Q

Well, Mr. Friedman, it will help me if you

would -- you’ve touched on it, but perhaps there’s more to it
if you would state what is the standard this Court is to apply
when it reviews the action of the Court of- Appeals of this kind.
You’ve said that they must look at the instruction as a whole
and not by bits and pieces.

That isn’t, for me at least, really

6
a standard,,

How do we —■

MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I think a fair way to put the
standard is to see whether, looked at as a whole, the charge
properly put to the jury, the job it was to do, explain to it
the basis on which it was to decide the case.

That is,

obviously, in hindsight, various judges, appellate judges
may decide that it would have been better to state ore thing
one way rather than the other way; that if they had been
charging the jury they’d have emphasized one thing rather than
the other.

But 1 think the basic question, the basic question

is looked at as a whole, it has to be looked at also in the
light of all the evidence before the jury, because the jury
obviously considered the instructions in the light of the
evidence that was presented.

Looked at as a whole in the

entire case, did this charge tell the jury what it was supposed
to do, what kinds of decisions it was supposed to make, on
what basis was it to make this decision, how was it to consider
this voluminous evidence before it?
I think that's the thing, and, if I may just say so,
with all due respect to the Court of Appeals, this is a lengthy
charge, the charge occupies 65 pages in the printed record,
this charge took the District Judge, Judge Frankel, three hours
to develop, to deliver.
I think it’s an exemplary charge.

it'a completely fair.

I really think

X don’t think it's a fair criticism of

it that it may sway the jury.

The judge tried to do everything

he could to be impartial in this charge,, he set it out in
detail? and, indeed, the Court of Appeals

at no point suggested

that there was any legal error in the charge., in the sense
that the court applied the wrong legal theories, or anything
like that.

It"3 just basically -— basically, it seems to us,

that what you have here is that, the Court of Appeals is here
substituting its judgment for that of the trial court as to the
emphasis to be given to tbs particular factors as to the way
in which certain things should be set.
And of course it was the judge who presided at this
case who saw all the evidence, who was really in the best
position to know how to frame his charge to the jury.
Now, if I may just briefly indicate what the facts in
this case show;
During the period of the indictment — the indictment
period covered from 1953 to the middle of 1961 -- Pfizer, which
had the patent on tetracycline, licensed only two other firms
to make tetracycline, to manufacture it.

That was the

respondent Cyanamid and the respondent Bristol.
It also licensed only those two, plus the two alleged
co-conspirators — the two co-conspirators, Squibb and Upjohn,
to sell tetracycline.

This is all alleged in the indictment.

In addition, there*s no dispute that during the entire
period of this indictment only one firm, Bristol, sold terra-

e
cycline in bulk c that is, not selling it to the drug trade in
the normal capsule doses as in other doses, it was selling it
in lump product, and that Bristol sold in bulk only to the two
co-conspirators, Squibb and Upjohn.
Now, in addition to that, the evidence shows that
during the period of this conspiracy, most of this period,
from 1953 to I960, and indeed for the two years before 1953,
the prices of all five of the conspirators on all four broadspectrum antibiotic drugs was substantially unchanged.
That is, the typical example, the most popular dosage
form was a bottle containing 100 capsules, and the pricing
system they used is they had a price to the customer, to the
person who gats the. prescription, and then they gave discounts.
Well, throughout this whole period, all of these
five companies on all of these four antibiotic drugs charged
$30„50 to lie druggist for this 100-capsule bottle.

And this

price remained static for a nine-year period, despite the
following facts;

that shares of the market shifted, one of

them, got more, the other one got less.
Despite the fact that, for example, Pfizer, who was
a low-cost producer, in the period from 1958 to I960, saw its
share of the market drop from 22 percent to 15 percent, while,
at the same time, Upjohn, that was a high-cost producer,
increased its share from 15 percent to 22 percent.
In addition to which, the evidence shows that there

substantial cost variations among the five co-conspiratorsv
a .cl, indeed;

he cost of producing these drugs during the

period was rapidly and substantially dropping, but, despite
this, no variation in the prices»
Kow, the government’s theory, as I will develop in a
minute, is that what you had here was a series of implied
agreements, the first of which was reached between Pfizer ano
Cyan amid, as the result of a settlement of a patent interference:
proceeding in 1953, and then another series of agreement*■, xoacJ•■•e.
between Pfizer, Bristol, Squibb, and Upjohn in December of 1955
when patent infringement litigation, that Pfizer had brought
against the last three of these people, was settled.
As I sav, there's no question what happened.

And the

government's theory of the case is that there were these
implied understandings and agreements under which the parties
agreed, first, that only the three respondents would be
licensed to manufacture tetracycline; secondly, that only those
three plus Squibb and Upjohn, would be licensed to sell it;
that only Bristol would be authorized — would be permitted to
sell it in bulk, and that Bristol would in turn sell only to
Squibb and Upjohn.

That's one element.

And, secondly, that during this entire period they
agreed to and did maintain identical prices.
Now, the question before the jury —■ the cruestion
before the jury — was whether this admittedly identical

10
conduct, in all of these things that happened, whether this was
the result of a conspiracy, of an agreement or understanding,
or whether it was the result of independent business judgment
by each of these individual firms, as they contended.
There was a vast amount of evidence introduced at the
trial on this issue.

This is one of these tynical big cases

that we get frequently in the antitrust, field.

The record that

is spread out here on the table before the Court contains 21
volumes of printed testimony? it’s more than 12,000 pages.
There was detailed and comprehensive evidence put in on
virtually every aspect of the case, evidence relating to
pricing, in relation to profits, relating to negotiations on
the settling of these patent suits, many meetings that the
parties had, there is a whole, great deal of testimony
relating to the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the
patent to Charles Pfizer & Son, in which the government
introduced evidence indicating that in connection with obtaining
this patent misleading statements had been made to the patent
office.

And that information mctterial to the patent office's

determination had been withheld.
Much of this information, of course, was technical.
It was highly scientific.

And, as to be expected, the

defendants offered detailed explanations as to why they did
what they did.
Wi rst, their officers denied there had been any

11
agreements or Understandings, and then they gave lengthy
explanations to why, as a matter of business judgment, they did
what they did.
And the court repeatedly told the jury that it was for
them to decide, on the basis of ail the evidence, of all of the
evidence, whether this was the result of an agreement, of
concerted action, or of independent business judgment.
I would just like to read one instance to the Court,
one excerpt from the charge at page 4987, which I think is
rather typical ofthe way the court put it to the jury.

And

this related to the discussion of the question of issuing the
bulk sales, making bulk sales, and what Judge Frankei charged
the jury was:
All relevant evidence and your recollection of it
will be part of your consideration as you undertake to consider
whether this situation concerning bulk tetracycline reflected
only normal and lawful business conduct by the several companies
involved or whether it tends to show the presence of the
conspirary the government alleges, or whether it shows nothing
either way.
And that same theme was reiterated by the judge in
his charge at least 15 or 20 times, as he took up each of the
12 means that the government had alleged were the way in which
this conspiracy was effectuated, each one, after he explained
the theories, explained the arguments, explained the

commented

briefly on the evidence,, he then pointed out that it was in the
final analysis for the jury to give whatever weight they thought
was appropriate to that evidence.
The charge we think was an exceptional charge, as X
have indicated, it was clear, it was fair, it was objective,
and explained to the jury on what basis they'll reach their
decision.
Now, we have lengthy briefs in this case, in which
are discussed at considerable length the various alleged errors
in. the charge, obviously it’s not feasible in the brief compass
of oral argument to deal with them in detail? and X will come
to two or three of them in a moment that are illustrative; but
I'd just like, X think it would be helpful in considering the
sufficiency and the adequacy of the charge to put a little of
this conspiracy into its proper factual framework.
The first broad-spectrum antibiotic drug came on
the market in 1943 and by 1953 there were three
drugs available.

broad-spectrum

Pfizer had one, Cyanamid had one, and Parke,

Davis, which the government said was not a conspirator and it
recognised that in this case, had the third one.
In 1953 •— and in 1952 the drug that Parke, Davis had
had gotten some unfortunate medical reports, as a result of which
its sales dropped sharply.

In 1953 Pfizer and Cyanamid together

had approximately 85 percent of the broad-spectrum antibiotic
market.

This business was extremely profitable to them,

13
representing a major if not the major share of their profits
and was also a major part of their total sales.
Now, in the summer of 1952 tetracycline was discovered
Word of this got around in the industry and it became quite
apparent that this was a great advance in the broad-spectrum
antibiotic field, and a drug that was likely to catch on very
quickly.

And within two years after its introduction, I think

it had something like 30 percent of the broad-speeferum anti­
biotics .
But the existence of tetracycline, of course,
threatened the market position that Pfizer and Cyanamid had at
that time, because if this were a superior drug and if in fact
this drug was not patentable or could not be patented, and
this drug came on the market with no patent protection, it

was obvious it would be promptly widely sold, and a number of
companies would corae into it, and "what you would have, basically
the record indicates, what you had in the case of penicillin.
Penicillin was not a patented drug, penicillin had a lot of
sellers, but price went down and down and down, and the result
of this is, for example, Bristol, at the time, we say, it joined
the conspiracy in 1955, that practically its whole business
was penicillin; it was losing a lot of money, it was in
desperate straits.
Pfizer, Cyanamid and Bristol, each filed patent
applications, on beginning in 1952 and continuing to 1953, and

14
Pfizer and Cyanamid had reason to believe that an interference
*

t

was about to be declared at the patent office, that is, the
patent office was going to determine which of these had
priority of invention»
Sc they got together and settled the case, and they
settled it on the: basis that they would exchange proofs of
priority, that whichever one turned out to be the winner would
get the patent, the winner would license the loser, they
would exchange knowhow, and, in addition, at this point Pfizer
had no tetracycline, only Cyanamid did, and Cyanamid agreed to
sell to Pfizer a very large amount of bulk tetracycline to
enable Pfizer to get right on tha market, because Pfizer was
concerned that if it did not have immediate tetracycline while
Cyanamid did, Cyanamid would get what they call leadtime, they'd
get their product onto the market, they would get the doctors
used to prescribing this and this would result in putting them
at a tremendous disadvantage.
They sold them a supply of many months, it came to
a total of $3,800,000, and they began shipping this drug even
before the interference was declared.
Well, things didn't, work out quite as they had
thought originally, after Pfizer — oh, let me go back
3.

bit.

con.

They did this, they exchanged proofs and Cyanamid
priority to P-fisser; Pfizer claimed the concession.

: this point Pfizer an icipated it would be shortly getting

15
the patento

And it was around this point that the chief

executive officer of Pfizer had a meeting in his plant with a
group of securities analysts, and after the end of the meeting
there were soma questions and answers and he was asked if he
got the patent, would they license others; and he said /'No,
we will not license anyone other than Cyanamid", a report that
was widely spread in the drug trade.
Well, things don't always work out as planned, because,
despite their best hopes, the patent office had declared it
interference, not only with two of these patents but also with
Bristol; and then, several months later, the examiner carae down
with a decision in which he said he was going to dissolve the
interference and rule that tetracycline wasn't patentable at all,
it was not patentable at all because, he said, he surmised that
tetracycline was co-produced with Cyanamid’s broad-spectrum
antibiotic Aueromycin, and the process by which these companies
were manufacturing tetracycline was to su.bj.ect Aueromyein to
some further things and, in effect, extract out of it the
tetracycline. They changed it molecular structure.
This of course posed a great threat to both of them,
and it was after this thing that Pfizer set out to try to
persuade the examiner to change his mind, that he was wrong,
that in fact the oroof being that tetracycline was not
produced together with Aueromyein; and this is where they made
the misrepresentations,relied on certain misstatements that

16
Cyanamid had made„
Now, under the licensing agreement that Pfizer and
Cyanamid had in settling the interference, when,, as soon as the
Pfizer patent was issued, Pfizer was to license Cyanamid and
Cyanamid was' to pay two and a half percent royalties on all
the tetracycline that's sold»
Well, one might wonder why Cyanamid, who would
immediately be subject to paying royalties upon the grant of
the license to Pfizer, would attempt to help Pfizer and to
press for license to Pfizer.

And Cyanamid!s patent counsel,

in his testimony, explained quite candidly why.

It’s in the

passage we’ve quoted at the top of page 16 of our brief.

He?

said the reason it was important to Cyanamid to see that the
patent issued to Pfizer was, ha explained, "We wouldn't have
people like Bristol in the market for one, we wouldn't have the
Italians importing it over here for another, and, of course,
anybody — with no patent on tetracycline, any Tom, Dick and
Harry with a little bit of money could get in the business."
And the government’s theory which was presented to
the jury was that this whole thing was part and parcel of an
implied understanding between Pfizer and Cyanamid when they
settled the interference proceeding, that they would limit'
licensing to the loser before the patent office, and that they
would set non-competitive and fixed prices on the sale of
tetracycline

17
Thereby in effect preserving the position they have.
Now, these different aspects of the case, of course,
were all interrelated.

Because the only way that the price

structure could be kept up, the only way that prices could be
kept high was if you were sure that you didn’t have any other
people coming into the industry who would cut the prices.

And

the only way you could be sure that no one else could get into
the industry was you could control it with a patent.
Howe this is, under the government's theory, how

Pfizer and Cyanamid began the conspiracy. The government —
what happened was Bristol, which at this point had no broadspectrum antibiotic and was in desperate financial shape,
although Pfizer had warned that it would sue anyone for
infringement who manufactured the drug, in the summer of 19134
began itself to sell tetracycline under its own brand, and
then in September of that year it gave licenses to Squibb and
Upjohn, the two co-conspirators -- I'm sorry.

It didn5t give

a license, it sold, it sold this tetracycline that it had in
bulk to these two firms.
The day that the Pfizer patent was issued, Pfizer sued
Bristol, Squibb, and Upjohn for patent infringement.

The

three of them filed answers, in which they challenged the
validity of the patent, asserting, among other things, that it
had been procured by misrepresentation from the patent office?
the response of Pfizer to this was to sue the three of them for

:is

tremendous damages.,

It sought $15 million from Bristol? $30

million from Upjohn? $6 million from Squibb,
At this point the suit was being contested rather
vigorously.
Now, later, in 1955, Bristol got word that Upjohn
had been talking to Pfizer about possibly settling the patent
suit,

Upjohn was quite concerned about this $30 million

potential liability? and then they had a series of agreements
which led to the termination of the Pfizer litigation.
First, there are agreements between Bristol on the
on© hand, and Squibb and Upjohn on the other, under which Squibb
and Upjohn gave Bristol the authority to settle and handle the
Pfizer litigation..
Q

Mr, Friedman, the Court of Appeals opinion

reversing the District Court didn't turn on the insufficiency
of the evidence, did it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, it did not.

Indeed, by

implication, the court presumably thought that the evidence
was sufficient, because it sent it back for a new trial; and if
it had felt that the evidence was insufficient — but I think
that these facts I'm bringing out and meaningful and helpful
in terms of some of the objections they raised to the charge.
So — and in the course of this licensing -- I'm
sorry; in the course of this agreement under which Bristol was
viuihorlzec to handle the Pfizer and Squibb interests in

19
settling — negotiating and conducting the litigation against
Pfizer

>

there was a statement in there that any license that

Bristol obtained for Squibb and Upjohn during the course of the
litigations during the course of the settlement, might be
\
limited, however, to giving Squibb and Upjohn the right, the
right to sell and use but not to manufacture.
So, in addition to which, Squibb and Upjohn were bound,
wore bound under this agreement, for the duration of the litiga­
tion with Pfizer, the patent litigation, and three years
thereafter, to purchase all their requirements of tetracycline
from Bristol.
So, at this point, Bristol

had the thing locked up

in the sense that it had control of the litigation, it was
protective and Squibb and Upjohn couldn't settle themselves
with Pfizer and perhaps purchase in bulk from Pfizer, and
therefore losing a customer? and at the same time it had put
in there a provision that would protect it from having to give
its two major customers, Squibb and Upjohn, the right to
manufacture and thus oust this important source of business,
Wow, ultimately, the litigation was settled, and
was somewhat precipitated by the fact that there was brought
out, shortly before'the settlement, the fact that a detective,
who was paid by the general counsel of Pfizer, had undertaken
to tap the telephones of Bristol and Squibb. And when this was
brought to the attention of Pfizer, Pfizer immediately said,

20

"Let's get together and settle it."
they settled it, as I have indicatedt

And they settled it, and
a license was given to

Squibb and Upjohn to make, use, and sell to the drug trade?
and a license was given to Bristol to manufacture, use, and
sell.
Slow, during the period thereafter, from —■ X mean
for the whole period to the end of the conspiracy, no one else
was licensed other than these five people, no one sold in bulk
other than Bristol, and during this same period there were ten
requests made for licenses or for bulk sales of tetracycline,
and they ware rejected.
Now, let me just very briefly refer to one or two of
*

the grounds on which the Court of Appeals said that the charge
was insufficient.
Let me tatethe major argument that the respondents
made here.
Parka, Davis was not a conspirator.

Parke, Davis,

during the period of the conspiracy, did many of the things that
the gofferrsaent said were done by the three respondents as part
of the conspiracyt they filed the same prices, they did not
grant licenses, and so on.

And the theory of the respondents

in this case, or:; of their principal defenses, was that Parke,
Davis vac doing the same thing, admittedly not pursuant to a
• - onory, as the conspirators had done, was strong evidence
that in fact that identical conduct was e result of independent

21
business judgment but not ~~ and not agreement or concerted
action.
The government of course pointed to the fact that
Parke, Davis in many respects has not done the same thing.
Parke, Davis, for one thing, was not in tetracycline; secondly,
Parke, Davis gave no licenses; Parke, Davis was not involved
in any of the patent litigations and the various negotiations.
The District Court charged the jury at length about
this issue.

It pointed out that they had heard a lot of

evidence with respect to .Parke, Davis; that Parke, Davis in
nose respects was similar, that in other respects it was
dissimilar; it pointed out that Parke, Davis was not indicted,
and it urged the jury, told the jury this was one of the
factors they could take info considex-ation„
The judge refused an instruction which the respondents
tendered, in which the respondents wanted him to line up the
dissimilarities —~ I’m sorry; the similarities between Parke,
Davis" conduct and. that of the respondents. The judge refused
tq do that.

He said that would be, quite correctly we think,

that that would be an unfair charge; it would be a loaded charge,
because if you have to charge on the similarities, I should
also charge on the dissimilarities.
They also objected because they, and the Court of
sals criticised the District Court for not permitting an
.

etc on. on V.tb presumption • of innocence. They wanted the

22
judge v.o

instruct on a presumption of innocence, that Parka,

Davis, not a defendant, was presumed innocent.
The judge said that the presumption of innocence
relates to the defendants, and' there was no occasion to
instruct on the presumption of other persons, that Parke, Davis
was not indicted; and that there was no need for the jury to
speculate on why they hadn't been indicted.
And had the judge given the instruction that the
respondents submitted, this could have engendered a further
problem of confusion because the jury might then, despite other
instructions, have drawn some inference ~~ drawn some inference
— that the fact that the respondents were indicted was itself
of some significance.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time,
MR., CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, Mr. Friedman.
Mr. Wood.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN E. F. WOOD, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
X represent Charles Pfizer & Company, one of the
three respondents in this case.

As to some matters in the

case, the factual situations of the respondents differ from
cross mother.

And my aim will be to present matters that are

common to the respondents, and at least are not inconsistent

23
with the views of any of the respondents.
At the outsat I should like to refer to the point with
which Mr. Friedman started, and that was the approach of the
Court of Appeals to this case, the nature of its review, and
the nature of the review that, as I see it, is being sought in
this Court*
The argument has been made in the government’s brief
that in this case, in effect, the Court of Appeals review was
over-aieticulcus, that it found slight errors on the basis of
considering particular language in isolation, and that this was
done without reference to the charge as a whole.
But, with respect, I urge that that is a wholly
erroneous evaluation of what the Court of Appeals did.

The

Court of Appeals tells us that their procedure was to review
the charge as a whole, and that they reviewed the entire
record, the whole of it.

They considered the different kinds

and. subjecte of evidence in relation to each other, and they
considered the court's treatment of these different kinds and
subjects of evidence, in comparison with each other.
And the Court was concerned that whereas the
instruction, when it. discussed evidence — and I *m not now
referring to the general parts of the charge where the basic
principles are applicable, but the parts
'\ioc-ansed.

in which evidence was

When the Court was discussing felt© pasts of the

uvidumcm upon which the defendants principally relied, it did

not give the jury much room to give weight to that evidence.
On the other hand, by, in effect, neutralising the
evidence upon which the defendants were principally relying,
the field was left for the inflammatory materials concerning
which much evidence had been put in, which, as the Court of
Appeals noted, really had the effect of converting this, in
the minds of a lay jury, to a trial for profiteering and patent
fraud.
The importance of the charge in this case was
fundamental, as the Court of Appeals expressly noted,

And of

course in reviewing the charge the Court of Appeals had to look
at the language of it, and, in commenting on the charge, it
had to comment on come of the language? but that is a far cry
from taking words in isolation. And I submit that the Court
will find that there was comprehensive review.

And the

conclusion to which the Court came was that because of errors
which it found, taken as a whole, not picked up one at a time
and laid aside, but .taken as a whole, these errors were
sufficient to deprive the defendants of a fair trial.
Now, that was, in the main, I submit, a factual
exercise and a. factual decision.

The Court of Appeals did not

cite a single case, as I remember it, in its opinion.
The question the Court of Appeals was addressing
itself to >/as having in mind the complexities of this case, the
different kinds of evidence that were involved, the

25

signiiiceace, In some instances very limited significance, of
some of the evidence that was most heavily emphasized by the
government j has this trial been conducted in such a way as to
have accorded to these defendants a fair trial?

And the Court-

felt itself forced to the conclusion that the answer to that
was no.
Mr. Friedman was asked what sort of review was
expected in this Court, I would respectfully submit to the
Court that the only review that could be done would be to go
through the same process that the Court of Appeals went through.
How, a word, if the Court please, about the basic
issue and the basic problem that the jury had to deal with
here.

It's been clear throughout the case, and conceded by

government counsel and stated by the court, that the govern­
ment’s sole reliance here, in its attempt to prove an implied
conspiracy, was on circumstantial evidence.

There were

agreements among the parties, written agreements? first
negotiated between Pfiser and Cyanamid in November 1953, a
later group negotiated between Pfiser on the one hand and
Bristol, Squibb, and Upjohn on the. other, in December of '55.
Those agreements regulated the rights and obligations
of the parties with respect to some of the subject matter of
this case.
There is no contention that any of those agreements
in itself unlawful*

It is conceded that the terms under

26

which these parties settled their affairs were lawful.

The

contention is, rather, that there were implied understandings
in addition fco what was put into these agreements, and that
the implied understanding was to be found on the basis of the
conduct of the parties after their settlements, and the
logical proposition asserted was that companies acting
independently and without conspiracy would not, in fact, have
acted the way these companies did.
Mow, as I've said, the Court found that some of the
evidence most heavily relied upon was,by the defendants, was
not given correct treatment in the charge.

Consider, for

example, the trial court’s treatment of the evidence as to
to
Parke, Davis & Company,/which Mr. Friedman has made some
reference»
Bear in mind, if-the Court please, that the proposi­
tion being put to the jury hare was that a company acting
independently and without conspiracy would not have done the
things that these defendants did, with respect to the pricing
of their products, with respect to sales in bulk, with respect
to the granting of patent licenses.
That meant, of course, that the jurors had to ask
themselvess

Well, what would an independent company not in

conspiracy have done?

And it happened that we had in this

case an independent, non-conspiratorial model, the second
Itr! -.-nf iy.r.nr,car? in the industry, one of the most successful

21
companies in the industry, which was assertedly not a
conspirator.
And the evidence showed„ without any question, that
as to pricing that company, Parke, Davis & Company, from the
beginning of its participation in this industry right down to
I960» acted exactly the same way these defendants did, with
respect to the levels of prices and all the other aspects of
pricing.
So far as bulk sales and patent licensing were
concerned, the evidence showed that Parke, Davis' behavior was,
if anything, even more niggardly than that of the defendants»
It granted no licenses to anybody»

It sold no bulk to anybody.

And the court and jury did not have to speculate as to why
this was so, the president of Parke, Davis was called by the
government and he testified about these policies of his company
and stated the reasons for them.
Q

So it was all laid out»

Were the counsel inhibited in any way from

arguing that evidence to the jury?
MR. WOOD:

Yes, Your Honor.

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'm going to come fco

But the key point is that an

important fact about the evidence was not put to the jury, and
X*m coming to that right now.
the key significance was that in this case government
counsel affirmatively asserted that Parke, Davis absolutely
was not a conspirator.

Xt was not merely said that, oh, Parke,

28

Davis was not indicted or has not been charged as a co-conspira
tor? government counsel said, and the trial court noted in the
colloquy which is quoted in our brief, that Parke, Davi
absolutely was not a conspirator» "And 1 state that on the
record,“ said government counsel»
Well, that meant that this company, the parallel
action of this company was the action of a company assertedly
not a member of any conspiracy.

We sought to have that fact

brought to the attention of the jury.

We asked the court, in

. *

its charge to the jury, to inform them of the fact that Parke,
Davis was asserted not to be a conspirator.

The court declined

to do that»
We then tried some other way.

We said; "Well, may

we argue, then, from a presumption of innocence?" And the
court said: "No, you may not.

1*11 stop you if you try that."

"Well, may we argue about the presumption of
regularity of business conduct?"

"No.

I’ll stop you if you

try that."
And the most that the court would do in informing
the jury about, this was to say that Parke, Davis had not been
indicted and was not charged as a ©©-conspirator.
And the charge went further and made greater

iifficulty for us because, after having limited the information
to the jury to just the technical fact that there was no
indi ctrvnt ago.inst Parke, Davis and no charge of being a co-

29

conspirator, the judge went further and told the jurors, in
emphatic terms, that the fact that Parke, Davis was not
indicted — and these are quoted from the charge — has no
relevance whatsoever in any direction as a fact in itself.
»

How, what could the jury make of that?
about. Parke, Davis is that it's not indicted.

"All we know

And the judge

tells us that the fact that it's not indicted has no significance
in any direction.

How can we weigh this evidence?"

And then the court took one final step — well,
before X — may X just refer to a passage, at page 70 of the
brief of the government in this \case, the main brief, it is
said there, inadvertantly, that there were constant reminders
that Parke, Davis was not considered a conspirator,

That,

the Court will find, is not what the record shows.
What we were trying to do was to get the court to
inform the jury that Parke, Davis was not a conspirator and that
we did not succeed in.
Well, the final words of the judge, about this
Parke, Davis testimony, said that, since Parke, Davis is not
on trial here and since the defendants are on trial, your
verdict, I quote, “must be based in the end on the law and the
evidence relating to them", to the defendants.

That left the

•Jury very little room to give weight to the action of Parke,
V,

They were told that what they must look at is not
!Wis' actions but the defendants.

30
How, my question to you earlier, Mr . Wood, was

q
this t

Was counsel for Pfiser inhibited in arguing to the jury

any of the evidence, the testimony that cape from the Parke,
Davis vice president?
MR. WODDs Wellf not
Justice,..

no, sir„

No, Mr. Chief

The limitations ~~ well, I've referred to the fact

that the — we were told that we could not. make certain
arguments.

We were told by the court also that we could risk

argument if we wished, but we were given the definite impres­
sion that the court was going to be very strict in limiting us.
And we simply did not know what to do.

We did try to argue it

to a limited extent, but since the key fact had not been put
to the jury,, and we were not free to put it to the jury, our
argument was necessarily much less effective than it could

have been»
Q

May I ask, Mr. Wood, are the arguments to the

jury reproduced in the record?
MR. WOOD5
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice, they are,

I don't see any page citations to them.

It's a

rather long record.
MR. WOOD:
Q

We could supply those.

Thank you.

'MR. WOOD:

Well, I have really, just as briefly as

I can adequately, on the Parke, Davis aspect.
I should like to turn to another part of the charge,

31
as to which the hrart of Appeals concluded that evidence
favorable to the defense was seriously undermined by the charge»
'And. that had to do with testimony by the principal officers of
the defendants
These men were called by the government as the
persons who made the decisions that were, alleged to be
nd they w -

examined at length by government

counsel. And they were cross-examined.

They gave detailed

factual accounts of the actions, their actions in determining
policies of their respective companies as to all of the
matters involved in the case.
They described the business and economic considera­
tions t many of them quite peculiar to the prescription drug
business, and many of them of special application to this
segment of that business that included these new wonderfully
popular wonder drugs»

And they showed how those economic and

business factors really governed their decisions and would
have not. indicated that other decisions could have been made
without loss of profitability.
in the course of this testimony, they told in
detail about the meetings at which conspiracy was alleged to
h .v

had its inception.

The meetings in November of *53

between Pfizer and Cyanamid, and the meetings in December of '55
at which Lristo?,

Squibb, and Upjohn were claimed to have

adhered to the conspiracy.

32
They described what these meetings were about, how
they came to be held, what problems they discussed, the
objectives of each party, what, was said and what was done by
the participants, very full, detailed, factual accounts of
what transpired.
Now, in the course of this, they made certain
denials, asserting that the agreements alleged to have arisen
by implication were not formed and that the parties remained
free, as to all these matters.
Now, this testimony was completely inconsistent with
any implied conspiracy.

And taken as a whole the testimony was

a cornerstone of the defense case.

But although the court,

in the charge tc the jury, began by saying that the juryshould give full consideration to this, the rest of the
discussion of this evidence — again I'm not talking about the
general parts of the charge but the parts where the court was
specifically addressing itself to this evidence? really
consisting, as the Court will see, of a series of reasons why
the jury should give that evidence little if any weight.
Now, time doesn't permit me to touch on —•
Q

Mr. Wood, isn't it the general rule in federal

courts that a federal judge can comment on the evidence?
MS. WOOD:

Oh, yes,

Yes.

But our contention, and

:ha decision of the Court of Appeals, was that the court here
commented erroneously.

33

Q

At the close of the instructions, Mr. Wood,

cry requests macta to the judge*, the trial judge, to
correct or supplement his instructions?
MR. WOOD:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, we spent several

hours with the judge, making exceptions, making additional
requests, urging the judge to correct some o£ the serious errors
that we felt were involved, and the judge did not change one
word of the charge.
Q

Now, again, is that colloquy with the judge

recorded in the record?
MR. WOOD:

I believe it is, Mr. Justice.

The *—

is this the colloquy?
5007.
Q

Thank you.

MR. WOOD:

X should note there that we had a

stipulation that all requests charged, and all exceptions, and
30

on, made by any one defendant would inure to the benefit of

all.

So the fact that one lawyer is speaking here and another

lawyer there has no particular significance.
Q

Now, X gather that during the deliberations,

the jury on occasion, maybe more than one, asked that parts of
the record be read to them?
MR. WOOD:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

They asked for the

Darke, Davis matter.
St's an interesting point there, which has some

34
significarce as to the effect of the charge and the importance
of looking at words.
The jury did not have to rely upon an impressionistic
recollection of something they had heard hours before.

We

followed here the unusual course that the court provided to
each juror a full copy of the charge, to take into the jury
room with him.

So they could taka it up line by line.» and

that they did so is indicated by the fact that when they asked
for evidence to be given to them they asked, for it by reference
to a specific passage.
Q

Was that by stipulation of the parties or at

least by consent?
MR. WOOD:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.

You did not object to that maneuver?

MR. WOODs That is correct.
Q'

In addition to the Parke, Davis matter, what

else, did the jury ask?
MR.'WOOD:
Q

I believe that's all.

That's all.

MR. WOODs Well, may X just mention a couple of
points about the difficulties with the charge; as to the
testimony of the officers.

I'll really limit it to one, in

view of the shortness of time.
After having suggested several reasons why the
testimony should be given perhaps limited weight or need not

*!> D

be given much weight, I believe that5s a fair characterization
of the effect of the charge, the court concluded on this
subject by saying that these assertions of innocence by the
officers may have included contentions of law; and off course he
had made it clear to the jury that they were to take their
law from the judge and not from any other source.
Nothing was said as to what part of this was
contentions of law.

It was simply said;

In considering this,

you must bear in mind that this may include contentions of
law.
Well now, this testimony was intensely factual, and
even in the denials it was factual.

The question here was

whether implied understandings had been reached by these men.
There was no question of lav/ as to what you can do under a
patent or what you can do in certain circumstances ? everybody
knew that if thss business was conducted independently, what
the parties did was lawful? if it was conducted under some
Implied understanding, it was not lawful.

So the facts of

understandings was the essential issue in the case.
And the factual nature off such testimony was
established by this Court in the Xnterstafce Cirealt case.
There the Court held, in a Sherman Act case, that inferences
adverse to the defendant could be drawn from the fact — drawn
as to whether there had been an agreement for concerted
action, because the defendants did not produce witnesses under

38
■their control who v?ere in a position fco testify as to whether
there had been agreements for concerted action.
Row, the necessary and explicit premise of that
decision was that this would be factual testimony, and it
would be anomalous, 1 submit, to hold, in the face of that
deedsion, that if such witnesses are called and do

:xxy,

the jury may be allowed to brush their testimony aside on the
ground that soma undisclosed part of it is regarded as making
factual contention — I mean legal contentions.
May 7 take just a few minutes on the subject of
costs, profits, unreasonable profits, unreasonable prices.
One of the most amasing aspects of this case was the
extent to which the prosecution was based on the constant
hammering at the proposition that these companies made too
much money, and that that necessarily meant that their
prices ware too high.
Whatever reasons were advanced for the admissibility
of the evidence about the coats and profits, those reasons
were not what was put to the jury by government counsel, the
hammering away, simply at the fact in itself, that these
profits were enormous and, as asserted by government counsel,
ware unreasonably high.
How, the technique chosen for showing that these

ware so high was to take the fair manufacturing cost
and comcnre that with selling price and say that the difference

3?
is profit»

The manufacturing cost included nothing for

research, or warehousing and. distribution, for selling and
promotions, for administrative overhead, taxes? so everybody
knew that this comparison did not involve a comparison which
could show true profit»
The government had available, had in. its possession,
accounting studies which were designed to show total cost, and
true profit»

It declined to use these studies, but hammered

away at this production cost, selling price comparison; and in
the opening to the jury, in the summation, with placards, with
magnified tables and charts, that was the subject that was
dinned into the jury, both into their eyes and into their
ears.
We tried as best we could to steer the trial away
from the question of the fairness of profits, because that
question has no bearing in this case,
Q

Well, did you put in opposing testimony as to

research, administrative, et cetera, costs?
MR, WOOD:

No, Mr. Justice, we did not»

Our plan, as

government counsel has .indicated in its brief, since the bulk
of the testimony upon which the defendants were going to rely
was being put in, had been put in by the government, we wished
to put in cur whole case, while, as part of the government’s
nasec so that we would not, in the eyes of the jury, be
protracting the trial with unnecessary carrying-on of what had

38
been deducted.
We did, in the course of cross-examination, seek to
have received these accounting studies
not finally but at that time.

They were rejected,

The one offered by Pfizer, for

example, was rejected on the ground that the government needed
more time to study it.
seven years.

The government had had it for over

And the argument that it should not be received

at that stage of the trial, because the government needed more
time to study it, frankly did not make any sense,
O

Did you reoffer it later?

MR. WOOD:

No, Mr. Justice, we did not.

We did not put in a case except to call one — one
witness to put in one exhibit.
Well, the —
Q

How much time was devoted to putting in your

case, Mr. Wood?

After the government rested.

MR. WOOD:
Q

Oh, half an hour.

Mr. Wood, incidentally, how long was the jury

out?
MR. WOOD:

It was out — hunh? — 14 hours.

A good

deal of which was at night.
Q

That is continuously, without a recess?

MR. WOOD:
Q

Yes, sir.

I gather, Mr. Wood, clearly what you say the

Court of Appeals held and properly held was that the things

you * ve been talking aboutf biased the jury in favor of the
finding of agreement, —
MR. WOOD:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.

— as to matters which, dene independently,

would not have been, illegal?
MR. WOOD:

Yes, sir.

And that these errors not taken separately, as
government counsel asserts, but looking at the conduct of the
trial as a whole, the charge as a whole, that the effect of it
was to produce an imbalance.

When the evidence favorable to

•the defendants was downgraded and undercut, when this inflamma­
tory evidence, principally relied on by the government, was
given much freer scope, the effect was an imbalance which,
in the judgment of the Court of Appeals, resulted in the denial
of a fair trial.
Q

Do you have any comment about Judge Hays'

dissenting opinion?
MR. WOOD: Well, only this, Mr. Justice Blackmun: —
Q

That you don’t agree with it?

MR. WOOD:

— he conceded at the outset that the

government’s evidence was not particularly strong, at least
not overwhelming, is the way ha characterized it.

As to some

:>f the errors, I submit, he did not disagree that they were
errors.

As to Parke, Davis, for example.

But ha said that it

appeared to him that it wasn't necessary to reverse on the

40

ground of these errors.
But 1 submit that the errors were fundamental and
fcnafc taken together they did result in imbalance, which was
quite hurtful to the defense.
Thank, you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Wood.
Mr. Friedman, your time was entirely consumed, but
if you have anything of great urgency, we*11 give you one
minute.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FRIEDMAN:

One minute?

Well, I’ll try to be

very rapid.
First, Mr. Justice Brennan, the arguments to the
jury are set forth at length at page 4719 to 4913.
Q

Excuse me, 47 —?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

4719 to 4913.

Secondly, I'd like to refer the Court to pages 60 to
65 of our brief, in which we argue that Parke, Davis and the
other defendants were not inhibited from making to the jury
the arguments on Parke, Davis; that we argue this was basically
a judgment, a strategy judgment made by themselves.
And, finally, I'd just like to say that we disagree,
disagree, with Mr. Wood’s argument that somehow this charge
denigrated the evidence that was favorable to the defendants

and stressed the inflammatory and prejudicial thing.

We

think this was a fair charge.
And all I can urge upon the Court is that when it
reads the charge, when it reads the charge, it seems to me it’s
completely objective, it discussed all of this evidence, it
recognised the problems on the costs, to which Mr, Wood has
referred the Court specifically? pointed out to the jury that
the cost figures were different between factory cost and
selling price; did not taka account of many other items of
cost, and that was extensively brought out in the examination
of the witness.

And the court charged the jury that those

were factors to be taken into account.
Thank you,
148. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Friedman.
Thank you, Mr. Wood.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:18 o’clock, p.m., the case was
submitted«]
