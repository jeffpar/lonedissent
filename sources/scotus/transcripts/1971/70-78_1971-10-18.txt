ORAL ARGUMENT O'iT PARKER M. NIELSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NIELSON:

Mr, Justice Douglas, and may it pleas©

the Courts
The matter now at bar involves the seemingly unrelated
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the ute
Termination Act of 1954.

These two seemingly unrelated

statutas are drawn into focus in this case because both of
them involve prohibitions against, overreaching, and both of
them create limited fiduciary obligations with respect to
those who are subject to their provisions.
The Uta Termination Act of'1954 had the effect of
dividing the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray

4
Reservation into two entirely artificially created groups, and
directing that all of the assets ©f the reservation, including
in particular, as far as th© facts ©f this case are concerned,
beneficial interests in th© mineral estate, were to be
divided between th® two groups and to be distributed to th®
Indians about to be terminated.
Now, l not® in passing that those who are responsible
for th© drafting of this law have referred to the group that
was about to b® terminated as mixed-bloods.

The term

^mixed-blood® is itself & slur, and it is offensive

to th©

petitioners in this case, who prefer to bo referred to by th©
term, Terminated ut.es.
Th® petitioner. Affiliated Uta Citizens of the State
of Utah, is th© authorized representative of all the Terminated
utsa, which was formad in th® manner specified in ,Section 6
of th© Ut© Termination Act by a constitution end bylaws,
*

which was duly ratified by th® majority vote of all of th®
adult Terminated Ufces at a special election called by the
Secretary of the Interior.
q

why do th® —th® statute, of course, talks about

mixed-bloods, and th© only Terminated Ufces ar© these who were

\
referred to in th® statute as mixed-bloods? is that true?
;

*%

/

MR. NIELSON*

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

When I made.'...• re fer©nc® to that circumstance, what I had in mind
is that in reality if we want to talk in terms of th® ancestry

5
of ths Indians on this reservation, all of them are indeed
mixad-broods.
Q

Thsy are misted —
Wall, while you were talking, I thought it might

be helpful to talk in terms of the statute.

HE, MXSLSQN:
Q

Yes.

&nd the statute does use that phrase throughout.

MR. NIELSON t

It &&®Be Mx, Justice Stewart? and my

point simply was that the term itself is offensive to the
petitioners, and they have designated themselves otherwise in
these proceedings.

Q

And yefc, I gather that full-bloods could become

by choice mixed-bloods? is that correct?
MR. NIELSON j

The statute did

bo

provide.

No on© in these proceedings disputes that the
Affiliated Uts Citi2©no was the organisation which was formed
in the manner specified by statute.

There is, however, a

rival organisation, which w® will discuss in som® detail in
those proceedings, known as the uto Distribution Corporation.
The Ufce Distribution Corporation is a corporation
formed under the corporate laws of the State of Utah,

It was

not formed by the adoption of a constitution and bylaws, .it
was not ratified by a majority vote of all Terminated Ute
Indians, nor was it. considered at a special election called
by the Secretary for that purpose•
Thus, the crux ©f the problem in this case, vis-a-vis

6
thaae two rival organisations, is the question of how tha
powers of the authorised representative could have been
transferred from the Affiliated Ute Citizens, who, admittedly#
were originally invested with those powers to the Ufc®
Distribution Corporation.
It is thus a conveyancing problem, plain and simple»
And I invite the Court to pay particular attention, to the manner
in which it is proposed that those powers wore shifted from
one organisation to the other.
The question tarns on the definition of authorised
representative# as contained in the Act.

We're not concerned#

for the purpose of that definition# with fch© question of owner­
ship of property.

Section .10 of the Ute Termination Act#

which is the section which defines the authorized representstiv® power» # refers exclusively to the question of powers to
manage th© jointly held and restricted assets of th® two
groups of Indians in the mineral estate.

It does not speak

in tanas of ownership of property.
The United States has proposed that the powers were
transferred from AUC to UDC by virtu® of th© provisions of
Section 13 of the Termination Act.

•Section 13# by contrast#

speaks only# and speaks exclusively# of powers with respect
to the ownership of property.

Th© authorized representative

powers were not powers that had any relationship to th®
ownership of property and in particular to tha ownership of

7
property by the individual mi scad-blood or Terminated Ufce
Indian# which is all that Section 13 relates to»
The individual petitioners in these proceedings are
of the Affiliated Ute Citizens who have brought a fraud
clai?; based upon their sal© of stock in the Ute Distribution
Corporation»
Now, for the purpose of their fraud claim# and this
distinction must b© kept in mind# the question of the
regularity of the formation of the Ute Distribution Corporation
is not an issue#

It is not m issue because the proceeds

from the management of this joint mineral ©state over the
period of time that wa*r@ her© concerned with has been paid#
in ■‘die form of dividends through the Ute Distribution Corpora­
tion •
The recognition at this point that the Affilited Ute
Citizens' is fch© proper authorised representative will not have
■ :

effect of restoring to the Terminated Utes the dividehue,

practices.

Thus# fch© regularity of Ufc© Distribution Corpora­

tion is am issue with aeespect' te the Affiliated ut@5s part of
the claim; it is not ah issu® v?ith respect to die individual
Indian * e fraud claims in the Royes side ©f this case»
The defendants in the fraud claims are th© First
Security Bank of Utah ©nd two of its officers.
States is not © defendant in th© fraud claims.

/

Th® United

s
The c:>nd-cict of the bank/» and its officers arises by
reason of it® conduct in executing its duties under a business
agent agreement which contemplated that they were to act as
stock transfer agent to Hoop the book® and record® of the
corporation and to perform certain incidental services•
It is the common elements of the conduct of the bank,
pursuant to that practice, which are important as far as the
fraud claires ar® concerned.
These common elements affected every Indian sale.
It doesn'*t really matter who the sale was negotiated with, the
common ©laments affected,necessarily affected every sale.
By common elements, I refer to the fact that every Indian stock
certificate, which had bold red-letter legends warning him of
its value and of restrictions on its transfer, were locked up
in the bank's vaults and the bank refused to make those
certificates available to any Indian prior to August 27,
1964, oven when he requested them.

And made no alternate

effort to convey the purport of those warnings to the Indian
■who desired to sell his, stock.
Thai practice affected, every Indian.

The bank and

: to officers were also acting in a capacity which w© could
loos/sly refer to as a market-making function? that is, fehoy ware
encouraging purchasers of th© stock, many' of whom wore located
throughout the United States, they were encouraging th© sale

of stock, and in many cases they were doing these things through

9

the a®divas of agents on both sidas.

That practice affected

©vary Indian sal©, notwithstadding who he may have solcl to»
In ©very Indian sal© there was also a deviation from

fell© regulatory provisions which had been promulgated by the
Secretary ©f the Interior.

Specifically,, the regulation®

require that any sale must be by endorsement of the certificate

itself; never in the history of the ute Termination hot, at
least prior to August 27, 1964, was © sale negotiated in that
fashion»
The regulations also required that the Superintendent
of the Reservation supervise the price and the terms of the
sale according to the terms of the offer, which require

payments- by cashier1© cheek, certified chock, or postal
money order; never was a sale supervised in that fashion.
Those practices affected ©vary Indian’s transaction.
Also, the bank and its officers neglected and failed

to disclose to any •'©£ these Indians that they were acting in
this dual capacity as market maker in relation to this stock.
Now, it ie true that there are also a large number
■ of otbar facto which, affected any particular Indian5® stock,'
and tfc-.s petitioners certainly take the position that those
dissimilar' facts, steading alone, would be sufficient to give
rise to a fraud claim.

And the bank, in its briefs in this

case, has attempted to focus on those dissimilar facts.

The petitioners tsk® th® position that it is not

10
necessary to get involved in the dispute over whether any
particular Indian got. a car, whether economic pressures war©
applied to any particular Indian, and, if so, in what fashion
fch© economic pressures were applied, for the simple reason that
the common element which necessarily affected ©very transaction
are sufficient to give rise to the fraud claim and were so
determined by the trial judge.
The claim against the United States, with respect t©
the sales ©f the Ute Distribution Corporation stock is bottomed
on negligence,

it is the claim of the petitioners that the

United States negligently permitted a deviation from the
regulations which had bmn promulgated, permitted a deviation

fxom

the requirement that the endorsement of the stock

certificate b© the only way in which this stock could be
transferred, substituted in its stead the transfer of the
stock by rasas® of a separate stock power.
That may seem unimportant on the surface, but the
affect of that deviation from the regulations was to withhold
from the Indians the warnings which were printed on that stock
for hi© benefits
The United States also, even though, as we read the
:V:v-;

£T*d regulations. Congress plainly directed that the

superir-tendent was tc regulate the price and terms of sale,

instead of doing so the superintendent adopted a practice of
r:?.©living s certificate from the Indian himself, the selling

11
Indianf who was legally in fch© position of a ward, that ha had
in fact received his money.
Thus, there was a complete abdication of the
responsibilities of the United States in that regard, and the
person who was legally in the position of: the ward was the one
who the United States looked to to satisfy those regulatory
obligations, whereas Congress, I think e fair reading ©f the
Act would bear m out on this, plainly contemplated that the
BIA should w*ot
q

isn't it true that that statute itself decided

that ward status?
MR. NIELSON: That is true, Mr. Justice Marshall,
•that was the dominant purpose of the statute.

But it's also

true that Congress recognized, in adopting this statute, as it
did in all of the Termination Acts, that these people were
going to have some trouble. They were not accustomed to
managing property, because they had been under the protective
wing of the United Spates for so many years, and so Congress
wisely, I think, directed that there be © phased period in
which services and protections would be withdrawn from them,
end that that period was to extend for a full ten years•
Mow, experience has proven that even that wasn't
enough, that these people needed protactions ©van beyond what
Congress contempleted.
But th© thing we're her® complaining about is that

;

r
12

the protections which Congress directed were not secured to these
people? and that, by reason of that, they were deprived of their
property»
Now, in many ways th® complaint of these petitioners
seem based upon fin© distinctions in th® law.

We'y© presented

an awful lot of complex legal arguments in the briefs.

In

reality? however, we'r© talking about a very fundamental
proposition, a very practical and fundamental proposition.
We could analogis®, I think, fee a situation where,
say, a person were to buy an annuity and pay for it throughout

hi© life, and when that annuity were to mature, instead of the
insurance company paying the proceeds of th© annuity fco the
annuitant, simply took th© proceeds and invested it for his
benefit, we'll say. in a mutual fund*
Now, it is not & question of whether that investment
is a good on© or a bad one, it's not a question in this case as
to whether th® Ut© Distribution Corporation is a good idea or a
bad idea, it5© not a question of whether ut® Distribution
Corporation was well-managed or whether it was mismanaged? the .
problem, really, is th© indignity of the Act itself to take ©
group of people, such as these terminated Utes, and say to
them, by way of congressional enactment, that we're going to
remove restrictions on your person and on your property and

you'r® going to b® treated like any other citisen in this
country? and yet before that property ever gets into that

13
Indian5?v hands to take it and assign it, to have Blh assign it
to this corporation, and not only to assign it font to make the
assignment, or purport to make the assignment irrevocable,

mo

that it would bind himself and his hairs forever»
Now, Congress plainly declared in the statute that
they were to receive their property in such a fashion that it
could be inherited and bequeathed.

That is the language of

the statute.
But BIA attempted to completely frustrate that, the
congressional intent, by making this assignment t© the uta
Distribution Corporation.
Nov;, turning to the Rule 10fo-5

aspects of the case,

this case represents the first time in which this Court has
had occasion to speck with reference to the fundamental
ingredients of a cause of action under Rule 10b-5.
X submit that the case is a very good on©.

It's a

vary good vehicle for this Court to consider the elements of
a fraud actiea undar Rule XQb-5, because of the wide variety
of misconduct which is alleged in -this case, which affords this
Court an opportunity to consider the whole array of possible
conduct which could b© considered as a violation of Rule lQh-5.
It's also a good vehicle because the petitioners
themselves have a peculiar need for the sort of protections
which arcs afforded under Rule 10b-5, and this Court many times
in the past, in the capital gains case and other cases which

14

it has considered on related issues, has said that the need for
investor protection is a relevant consideration which should he
taken into account in determining whether any particular fact
sifcu. tion. falls within the proscriptions of Rule 10b-5.
Would there be any other forum for claims of

Q
this Kind?

state courts, for example?
MR. NIELSON%

Not for the Rule 10b-5 claims, not

for the private claims.

The federal courts are vested with

exclusive jurisdiction under the Exchange hot, ©£ a cause of
action under Rule 10b-5.
Q

But does this alleged conduct — is that the

basis for any other claim in the State courts?
MR. NIELSONs

Th-sr® is no other claim pending, Your

Honor.
Q

But could there be?

MR. NIELSON:

Q

I don't think that — wail ~

In other words, could these petitioners have

a «-id in a State court on these claims?
MR. NIELSONs

s suppose it would have been possible

for them t© bring an action under the State Blu@ ;Sky law on \
tha fraud claims.

I think that it would have been impossible

t© bring the Indian law claims in the State court? even with
*

•

1

\

respect to the State Blm Sky law, however, the very reason
that most of these securities fraud cases wind up in the
federal court is because the remedy under the State Blu® Sky

15
laws is inadequate.

It's inadequate for a number of reasons.

First of allf the States ar© plagued with short
statutes of limitations, which frequently bar a fraud
claimant.

Secondly, the State procedure affords the oppor­

tunity for devices such as non-resident cost bonds, and things
of this sort, which are employed by defense attorneys to
discourage the bringing of a legitimate claim,
And so, in general, as a practical matter, —
Q

But did you suggest that* as an Indian claim,

that that fact, alone would he. a bar to any State court action?
MR. NIELSONs

No, 1 don't suggest that*

Now, as 1 read Rule lObr-5, it basically requires,
in addition t-o the jurisdictional elements, the showing of
two elements,, and they are as follows:
First of all, there must be one of. the prohibitive
actions.

That is, there must either be a deceitful scheme or

there must be a misstatement of a material fact, or omission
to state a material fact, or a course of business which, if
pursued, might result in a fraud.
Secondly, that conduct, whatever it might be, must be
accomplished “in connection with" the purchase or sal© of a
security.

Now, I stress the words “in connection with" because,

es Professor Bromberg has said in his treatise on the subject
of Rule 10b-5, the words "in connection with" ar© the loosest,
and w® must asstime intentionally the loosest linkage which is

16
prescribed in any of the Federal Securities laws.
Section 17(a) of the 1833 Securities Act, for
©xempl©, uses the term — the fraudulent practice, which is
substantially the same — "must be in the offer or sale of a
securitys; it must be Min“ the offer or sal©.
This Act says *in connection with" the offer or sale
of a security.

' .

The lower federal courts,, during the period of time
that inmHad liabilities have been developing under the
Exchange Act, Section. 10 &nd Rule 10b-5, have wrestled with
tja& question of whether additional elements may be engrafted

onto those prescribed by the rule.

They have considered a

wide assortment of additional elements, including scienter,
proximate cause, reliance, I -think ar© the principal ones which
they have considered.
ie error of the court below in this case was that it
went far beyond even what has been required in other courts
which have considered these elements and required, in this
case, that there be a direct participation as a purchaser or
sailer; and that direct participation must be for a profit.
Thus, the lower court in this case imposed upon these
plaintiffs a standard which is far higher than even that which

is pvvvcriwvd in Section 17(a) of th© 18 33 Securities Act, and,
X might add, even higher than was required at common law.
m submit that the limiting factors which are

17
prescribed in the statutes and rule itself ar© entirely
adequita and are the only ©nss which ought to he considered.
2 refer in particular to the requirement of a showing
of materiality.

The respondent bank itself has noted that

even the courts which talk in terms of reliance quite often
come up defining reliance so that it comas out sounding juste
about like materiality.
The other limiting factor which is proscribed by the
statute and rules is that of causation.

I note that the rule

itself does not use the term *causation”, but I have cited
some legislative history in my brief which indicates that
Congress, in considering the .1934 Act, did make reference to
the fact that any person who is injured by these practices, or
whose injury was caused by these practices, ought to be able to
recover? and therefore, 1 submit that' causation in the "but for*"
sens© v;culd be an appropriate limiting factor.
I think that that construction is born© out by the
language of the Act, and 1 note in particular that in this Act
Congress attempted to proscribe any misconduct of the type
which is defined by the rule in connection with any purchase
or sals of securities.
I think the use of the term "any" in both of those
c ontexts was a calculated one, end that it should be given
effect*
As X say, the common law in cases most analogous

IS
to the facts row at bar did not impose a requirement nearly as
high as that required by the Court of Appeals in this case»
,

/

>

/

.

I have cited in my brief seme common-law deceit cases, which
were — which arose in the context of market sales of
securities* and what those cases stand for*

And also some

writings of Professor Thompson* the noted expert on corpora­
tions . What those cases stand for is the proposition that if
a person makes a misstatement* we'll say by means of a
prospectus* and he distributes to the public afe large* in
©ne casce that is cited* by means of leaving it at a bank* so
that any member of the public could pick it up and read it?
if there are lies in that prospectus* any member of the public
should be permitted to recover, because it was directed to any
member of the public»

Thus* they come within the ambit of

responsibi1ity.
By contrast* if the misrepresentation is made to a
Halted group* why, then* also* the ©mbit of responsibility
would be further restricted.
That was the rule at the common law* and it is
universally recognized that Rule 10b-5 is an extension .of the
common law and therefore 1 submit that w® should at least read
this rule as broadly as the provisions of fch© common law.
Now* as X say* fch© facts of fcnis case and fch® legal
questions are complex, X would like to reserve an ample amount
of time for rebuttal, because X think that X will have a lot of

19
things that I -will want to, respond to,in relation to the
government in particular? if there ere

210

questions by th©

Court at this point# 1811 reserve th© balance of my time# then#
for rebuttal.
q

Mr. Nielson, I have on® question.

Pm X correct

in concluding that Judge Christenson at th© district court
level can» up with a figure of $1500 for th© shares?
MS. NIELSONs That's correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
Q

Do yon feel that there is evidence in the

record sufficiently supporting that figure?
MR. NIELSONs
Justice Blackmun.
Christensen did.

1 think there's no question, Mr.

I think we have to understand what Judge
Judge Christensen considered all of the

evidence which was presented, including, in particular, th©
evidence of tb@ appraisal of the mineral ©state, which# if
divided by the number of shares involved here, would have
ed — -would have given rise to a damage figure
in excess of $28,000 per share.
Mow, Judge Christensen felt that that would be —
that would not be a proper result because of the position of
those

©holders who had not sold, and he — I cited his

coiaasnts in th© Appendix, where he makes reference fe© this;
that it would seam unfair to# in effect, penalise those who
did not. sail by giving those less prudent# who did sell, the
full value immediately, whereas the others may 'have to wait

20
for decades # maybe centuries# to recover that amount.
Nov/# I think that was a wise approach.

The trouble

with it is that it leaves the benefits# the remaining value
of this mineral estate in the hands of the wrongdoers# and
that was the very reason why the Affiliated Ufce!s case was
initiated.

And it was initiated# I might say# prior to th© time

of judgment.

So that there would be a way that that windfall

to the fraudulent parties could be avoided and th© mineral
estate could ba vested in those — the remaining mineral estate
could b© vested in those properly entitled t© it.
Q

Well# then# I understand# at the moment anyway#

you're not complaining about th© $1500# are you?
MR. NIELSONs

I think that if th© Court were to grant

a remedy such as I have suggested# we would have to remand this
case for a further hearing on what th© proper amount of
damages should be,.

We’d have to have some evidence on what the

distributions ware during the period of time that -the terminated
Utes have not been in possession of their share of the mineral
estate.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS?

Mr. Randolph.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH# ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
MR. RANDOLPH?

Mr. Justice Douglas# may it pleas© the

Courts
These two consolidated cases raise quite different

21
issues with respect to th® liability of the United States.
The issue in the Affiliated Ut© case is whether the
district court properly dismissed th© action for lack of
jurisdiction, finding that it was an unconsented-to suit
against the United States
Th© issue in the Reyos case, on the other hand, is
whether the Court of Appeals proparly found that the United
States had no to prevent terminated mixed-blood Indians from
selling their shares at less 'than fair market value.
Although the cases raise quite different issues,
as conns©! for th© petitioners has said, both relate to the
Ut© Partition Act of 1954.

And I think the history of that Act

n& the working of that Act is necessary to an understanding
of th© claims in those cases.
In 1954 th© Ut® Indian Tribe of th® Uintah and Ouray
4

,

Reservation in Utah consisted of approximately 1800 members.
There were two distinct groups?
th© mixed-blood Indians.

the full-blood Indians and

The mixed-blood Ut© Indians consisted

©f approximately one-guarter of the 1800 members of th® Tribe,
For a number of years preceding 1954 there had been
considerable friction among the mixed-blood and full-blood
Indians.

The reason for this was quit® understandable.

Many

of oh© mixed-bloods did not live on the reservation? many of
th© mix&d-bloeda were already integrated within the non-Indian
society? their standard ©f living was virtually indistinguish-

22
able fro® fch® non-Indian society in which they lived, and their
educational status was the same.
The friction between these two groups reached its
peak in 1950 and 1951, when this group of Indians on the Uintah
and Ouray Reservation became entitled to 60 percent of a $31
million judgment against the United States,
The full-blood Indians, also quit© understandably,
wished to use this money to improve their reservation, fc©
build schools and hospitals.

However, many of the mixed-bloods

wished to have tin® money in cash, and had no interest in
spending it on the reservation where, of course* they never
lived, and had not lived.
The groups met in Tribal Council over a period of
approximately one year, to work out these differences.

The

Ute Partition Act of 1954 is the result of their compromise.
It represents, more than anything else, a treaty of peace
between those two groups.

Because the Act itself was drafted

@nd hammered out by the Indians, and then introduced, at their
request, in Congress•

And while the Act was being considered

by Congress, both representative® of the mixed-blood and fullblood group went to Washington and supported, fully supported
the bill, and said that it had been submitted t© a vote of
their respective memberships and approved overwhelmingly.
Tfeer® are three main features of the Ute Partition
Act.

Chit® is a division of the Tribal assets, and of course it

did not. affect th© individual assets held by the individual
xa-~Eib©.v:s of fch-a Tribe; only the Tribal assets.
Th® second feature is the termination of th® mixedblood Indians.

They were defined as having not more than one-

half Ute Indian blood.
The third feature is that th® full-bloods would —
that the trustee relationship between the United States and the
full-bloods would remain.
Tfos way the Act was administered,, and th® way this
partition took place, of course, was quite complicated.
The one thing that can be said about it is that it
was dsns by the groups themselves, because the Act provided
that the groups would, first of all, first th® mixed-blood
and full-blood groups would meet together and devise a plan
for dividing their assets between them on the basis of their
relative

numbers in the groups.
This turned out to be, whan th© final rolls were

published, 21 percent mixed-blood and 73 percent full-blood.
Th® next atejp in th© process was to have th© mixedbloods meet by themselves and determine a plan for distributing
these assets.
The plan of distribution and th© plan ©£ division arcs
contained in th© record in this case.
On© of th© difficulties, of course, the group ran
into vim how to distribute asset© that were not easily,

24
equitably divided» such as oil» gas» and mineral rights*
Whan the Ct® Indians wera considering drafting this
Act, they of course realised that it would b© inequitable to
split up just solely on the basis of geographical considera­
tions and mineral rights.

The Tribe owned at that time

approximately one million acres of mineral rights» which is
approximately the sis© of Delaware.
So what they did» and what they decided to do» was
to retain the mineral rights» the oil» gas» and mineral rights»
as Tribal property and to split up only on© thing, ox only
two things s

the proceeds from fch® minerals right® and the

management.
The management was t© be joint? fch© proceeds war©
to be distributed on a 2? percent and 73 percent basis.
As plana worked out, of course, both groups needed
representatives to negotiate the plans sad work them out for
them.

The Tribe had its own Tribal Council, and that was

no problem.

However, the mixed-bloods» first of all, adopted

a constitution and formed an organization known as Affiliated
Ute Citizens.
In the constitution of Affiliated Ute Citizens, it
provided for delegating authority irrevocably to corporations
in order to manage certain of the assets of the mixed-blood
group.
Three corporations were formed#

the Rock Creek

25
Cafetlo Company; th© Antalop© Shesp Range Company, which dealt
with grazing lands? and the other, the Ut® Distribution
Corporation, which is involved in this case.
The* Corporation was formed in IS58,

it issued ten

shares of stock t© each individual mixed-blood Indian; and
4

the mixed-bloods totaled 490 at that time.
This, then, is the posture of the case.

th© plan of distribution had, 1 believe it's Section 10 —
and it's printed in th© Appendis to th© amicus brief by th©
Tribai. printed in ■full ~ they contemplated forming a corpora*

That plan was unanimously adopted by the membership,
or at least @© it's reported in & resolution by Affiliated Ot®

Q

And it provided for the formation of Affiliated

ut© Citizens?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes? oh? yes; no question.

677® of

the Act provided specifically for that.
In the Affiliated Ut© Citizens case? the suit was
brought against the United States in name and form? and in the
complaint the claim was that the individual members of this
organization wore entitled to "an individual undivided pro-rata
share of 27 percent of approximately 1?200?000 acres of mineral
lands subject only to the right of the Association to manage
that property jointly with the Tribal Business Council."
Jurisdiction was invoked primarily under 25 U.S.C.

29

345.

The district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and

for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be
granted,
The Court ©f Appeals affirmed on the basis that this
was aa unconsented-to suit against the United States and that
Section 345 did not supply the necessary consent t© b@ sued.
Unlike many recent cases in this Court, where the
question was whether a suit against an officer ©f the United
States was really a suit against the United States, in this
case there is no such question.

Zt*s brought directly against

the United States in name and form, and it's long been held in
this court-, that a suit relating to government property against
the United states cannot be brought without the United States5
consent.
fills principle applies equally to Indian land held
in trust by the United States, and applies also when the suit
is brought by a group of Indians claiming the beneficial
interest in that land.
In this case there is no dispute whatsoever that
the United States holds title in trust to the mineral assat®
on the reservation•
Therefore, plaintiff's action, in order to g©
forward, fcv.s t© he based on some specific statute.-, federal
statute, authorising this kind of suit.
Section

25 U.S.C. 345*

They've invoked

30

Th&t section# which is set out on pages 90 to 91 of
our brief, providas that any parsons who are in whole or in
part of Indian blood ©r descent who are entitled to an
allotment of land under an Act of Congress, or who claim to he
so entitled, or under any allotment Act or under any grant mad©
by Congress, or who claim to be unlawfully denied or excluded
from any allotment or any parcel ©f land, to bring an action
in the district court to determine' — end the jurisdictional
section is after the semi-colon — where the district court
may determine any action, suit, or proceeding involving the
right of any person to an allotment of land.
W@ think this case does not fall within that statute.

MR. RANDOLPH*
law.

Allotment is a term of art in Indian

In the latter half of the 19th Century it was the policy

of the United States, as particularly expressed in the .
Gen-oral Allotment Act of 1887, to shift the rights of Indians
in real property from simply participation in Tribal property
to rights of individual ownership in particular tracts.
The land, or the mineral estate involved in this
case is th© very antithesis' of an allotment of land? because
it!s never been divided, it!s Tribal property, there's no
question about that.

There's no individual ownership of this

land involved.
In the usual allotment situation, a reservation would
bo surveyed, a tract of a certain number of acres set aside,
the Indian would make a selection, and th© Secretary of
Interior would issue a patent.
Section 345 relates only to those kinds of
situations.

W® think this is not a suit regarding an allotment

of land, by any stretch of th© imagination.
1 turn now to the Reyes case,

in Rayos there were

The whole point of the Reyoa case

was that the stock

had substantial value.
In the Affiliated Ute case» on the other hand, the

claim was that the corporation was invalid end that it should
never have bean given the assets to manage to begin with.
We think they're basically inconsistent.

That's right.

' t— i

'

In Reyoa, the. 12 designated mixed-blood plaintiffs
sold t.‘...I,r stock during. 1963, 1964, and 1965.

They sued th©

United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and their
curia was that th® government was negligent by failing to
prevent them from selling their own shares for less than fair/
market value.
think the Court of Appeals correctly held that the
trust relationship between the government and each individual
miac©d~blood terminated in 1961, before any of th® sales took
place, and. that the government therefor® had no duty to

33
The mixed-bloods formed UDC in 1958, and they issued
stock„
Under 677v of the Act, the Secretary of Interior, on
August 27, 1961 — and this is on page 40 of our brief —
issued a termination proclamation, stating that with respect
to each slid every individual mixed-blood federal restrictions
on the property have b@sn removed, the federal trust relation­
ship to such individuals terminated, and such individual shall
not be entitled to any of the services performed for Indians
because of his status as an Indiem; and all statutes of the
United Statas which affect Indians , because of their status
as Indians shell no longer be applicable.
We think that after this period the Secretary of
Interior head no duty to say, or had, indeed, no right to say
to an Indian, "You can't sell your stock for that amount" or
"I will only lot you cell your stock if you really need the
money at this tima" or even, as h© might have said if this
war© restricted Indian property, "You can only sell your stock
if you spend fch® mangy and proceeds for food and clothing for
you and your family."
We think that after 1961 ha not only had no duty to
do that, I think the mixed-bloods would have been infuriated
if he had tried to do that. .
The plaintiffs have claimed, however, that there was
a right of first refusal, and that they claim that this right

34
of first refusal, comehow created the duty on the part of the
United States, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs., to
supervise their shares even after 1961«
q

Well, what do they suggest as the source of

their right of first refusal?
MR* RANDOLPHS
Brermaus.

ItVe not entirely clear, Mr. Justice

Wo think, the right of first refusal stems from

Artio!© VIII of the Articles of incorporation of the Ufc©
Distribution Corporation, which provides that any mixed-blood
who sells his shares before August 27th, 1964, must first
offer them to members of the Tribe.

If there}s no acceptance

of: that offer, he may then soli at the same ore greater amount

under the same terms and conditions offered to the members.
The Secretary of Interior was required, under the
Articles of Incorporation to certify to one things

that the

"offer to members of the Tribe 'was mad© in accordance with the
low and regulations of the Secretary of Interior.

That is the

original offer, which, if not accepted, would allow fchev mixedt! i

. ;.! X to whomever he pleased.
This is contained on page 6 of the exhibit* also fcfea

regulations.•

*

Finally, I might point out, that under the Act, under
677n of th© Act, there is a similar right of first refusal for
land.

And so when the Secretary promulgated regulations

dealing with the right of first refusal for land, the very

35
last clause of those regulations stated that, as far as
!

practicable, these regulations should apply to sales of stock
in the corporation formed by the mixed-bloods.
The bank operated as transfer agent for the stock,
and tho Ute Distribution Corporation and the bank worked out a
procedure in September of 1963.

I might point out at this

point that there were no sales of stock until the lata summer
of 1963.

From the time tho corporation was formed until the

summer of 963 there ware no sales of stock.

The first sal©

took place, 1 think, approximately August of 1963.
But the Bank worked out a procedure —
Q

Let me ask you, just for a moment, sir, on this

right of first refusals

Looking at the summary of your

argument on page 23 of your brief, "Before a mixed-blood could
sail his stock to a non-member of the Ute Indian Tribe, he was
required first to offer the stock to members of the Trib© at
a price not less than that for which he intended to sell to the
outsider"?
MS. RANDOLPH s
a

Shouldn't that be "not more*?

MR. RANDOLPHS
Q

Yes, it should be.

"Not more0, isn't it?

MR. RANDOLPHS
Q

Yes..

That's right.

Ho could not sell it to an outsider for less.

MR. RANDOLPHs

That's right.

Right.

36

Q

Well, raay I tak© tfe® liberty of changing that

in pencil on ray copy*?
MR. RANDOLPHS
Q

Yes, will you please do that.

Thank yon.

ME, RANDOLPH:

1'm very sorry about that error.

In any event, the Bank operated as transfer agent
for the stock, and they worked out a procedure with the Ute
Distribution Corporation whereby — and this is contained on
pages 29 and 31, 29 to 31 ©f the Exhibit Appendix — whereby,
after the offer had been made and not taken up by a member of
th© Tribe, the seller, when he completed his sale, would furnish
an affidavit and a stock power to the Superintendent of the
Reservation, and then the Superintendent of' the Reservation
would issue this certificate stating that the offer, th©
origins! offer bad been properly mad® to the bank, who them
transferred the stock to th© buyer.
r,\'.

.

Apparently th© main thing, according to petitioners,

that the Superintendent did wrong her© was that he failed to
investigate whether th© plaintiffs in ‘this case war® telling
the truth in their affidavits.

The Superintendent apparently

thought that th® regulations in the ute Distribution Articles
of Incorporation required him only to certify that the original
offer was proper.
And X think maybe that was too strict an interpreta­
tion of th® regulations

37
However, the on© thing that seams perfectly clear is
that fcii© right of first refusal did not create any duty to
the people that wore selling the stock, and who apparently had
not told the truth on their affidavits.

Because the right of

first refusal, if anything, was for the benefit of the people
who would buy, was for the benefit, of the people who remained
in the Tribe and also for the mixed-bloods, so that they could
retain control of their corporation.
The seller., obviously, cannot accept his own offer,
and w-s think, therefore, that this created no duty to the
people who are bringing this suit, th© mixed-blood sellers,
who claim to have sold for less than fair market value.
W® don't; think they are entirely without protection,
however; and Part III of our brief deals with that question,
whether they're entitled to protection under th© Securities
Exchange Act.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN J. BERTOCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP RESPONDENT FIRST SECURITY BANK
OF UTAH, N.A.
MR. BERTOCHs

Mr. Justice Douglas, and if the Court

pleases
I represent the respondent, th© bank and the two
individuals that a.ra employed by th® bank, Gale and Haslem.
Of course it is our desire that this Court sustain th® decision

38
of the United States Circuit Court, of Appeals*
On© difficulty in this case from the beginning ha©
been this s

that counsel for the plaintiff,and now the

Securities said Exchange Commission, in connection with its
brief, has constructed hypothetical facts that do not relate
to the particular individuals who are the petitioners in this
case.
It is the suggestions made here today that seem to b©
that somehow we polluted the atmosphere with some kind of
fraudulent fluvium which is breathed by everyone who had this
stock to sell# by all of the mirad-bloods„
And the question, of course, is whether or not Gal©
and HasIsm, our employees, violated XOb-S,

And the only way

that can b© ascertained, whether or not that affected, whether
it Gauged damage to any of these 12 petitioners is to be found
in the fasts and the law related to those 12 individuals.

it

is not. to b© found out here in th© abstract somewhere*
Plaintiffs' counsel, or petitioners5 counsel has
consistently and repeatedly tailored a coat of many odious
colors, which has never been worn by, and which doss not fit
any of the particular petitioners in this lawsuit*
So I can only appeal to the Court in deciding this
case that it can only be determined whether or not these 12
individuals have bmm injured or any of them have been caused
desu&g© because ©f a violation of lOb-5 is by examining th© facts

39

and th© law with respect to ©ach on© of these individuals„
Now, let's go to the acts which have been considered
or which have been considered violations of lOb-5.

Today,

with respect to the wrongful acts ©f the Bank or its corporate
seif, my friend, coileagu®, Mr. Nielson has said that they
retained these stock certificates in the Bank so the Indians
couldn't read, the irdxed-bloods couldn't read this notation

on it that it was valuable.
Well, of course, that was done by 'the Bank at the
request of the Uta Distribution Corporation, at th© request
of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the agreement of all three,
believing that would b© helpful to the Indians so they
’wouldn't lose their shares of stock.

That is hardly a fraud

and hardly a part of this pollution of fraud which fills th©
air.
As far as the market-making is concerned, which has
been mentioned, the Circuit Court of Appeals specifically said
there was no evidence that the Bank did anything about making
market.

And on these gentle matters it is ©f no help to this

Court if Mr. Nielson and I just stand up her© and he says you
did, and I say you didn't? all he and I can do is refer you to
tii© record, and that is what I do.

I just categorically deny

that tlier© were all these actions by the government which
created an atmosphere of fraud.
But let's talk about specific things %

that even the

40
Circuit. Court of Appeals said they did impose a. possibility of
violation of 10b-5 in connection with the action of a couple
of these petitioners; and X think we ought to examine those.
And I'm willing to examine those where the circuit
said maybe you did maybe your men did violate Section lGb-S•
Let’s take Mr. Gal©.
It should be kept in mind, first of all, that of
these 12 petitioners, Mr. Gale bought stock from only two?
he bought five shares from Mr. Reed end five shares from Mrs.
Wopsocks and that's all he bought.
With respect to th© other ten, he didn’t buy any
shares from them; h© had nothing to do with encouraging th®
sale, with participation in the sal®, or getting any benefit
from the sale, nothing at all to do with them except in
connection with aoia® of them he signed — notarised an
affidavit or h© guaranteed the signature on stock bars.
that's all h© had to do with it.

And

And soma of them he had

nothing to do with at all; didn't ©van know about it.
With regard to Mr. Haslexa, on the other hand, he
bought from only two of these.
he

One ©£ them was again Mr. Reed,

bsught his other five shares, from Glen Reed.

Q

H© bought these as principal?

MR. BERTOCH8

As principal, yes.

Of course none of

thejs© wore bought by the Bank or sold by th® Bank; the Bank
got nothing out of it.

41
Q

How did all thes© used-car dealers get into

th® picture?
MR. BERTOCHs

Well, tli© used”car dealers got in fch©

picture on their own, and there were many used-car dealers in
on the pictura.
Of the approximately 1300 shares of stock sold during
the period of 8 63 and 864 and 865 — we're dealing with th©
1300 shares ©f stock sold — there were 32 different white men
who purchased stock.
As a matter of fact, Gale and Haslem bought 113 shares,
the two of them together? only 8 and a third percent of all
those that war© bought and sold.
But some of these were to used-car dealers.

Now,

the evidence doesn't show whether th© used-car dealers
themselves committed fraud on these people.

They may have.

But th© record doesn't show because th® used-car dealers paid
some money and ran, got out of th® case? were settled out of
the case.

So we cannot say.

But it may well be that some of

these used-car people did take advantage of some of these
people, and got some of their stock and gave them less than
desirable considerations.
Q

There was a total of 113 individual non-Indian

buyers of this stock over the period involved, is that right?
MR. BERTOCHi
buyers that l know of.

Ho.

No, there were 32 non-Indian

There were 113 shares of stock bought

by Gale arid Haslera.

I think th® record shows there

ware about seven of them who were outside of Utah.
Q

How far away,

MR. BSRTOCHs

for example?

On© from Illinois, one from New Orleans,

on® from Arisons, a couple from Colorado, that I can remember.
Q

How would people that far away be likely to know

about th© availability of these shares, to purchase them?
MR. BERTOCH:
relatives.

I don't knew.

They may have known from

I will say it wasn't the Bank who advertised it.

I don't know how the individuals found out.

I know that some

of them cams in and they contacted the Bank, because the Bank
was th© transfer agent; but 1 don't —

Y&s.

And wa. submit that that is just

utterly false, and the record will hot support it? and the
circuit said that specifically, that the record did not
support tii© contention that the Bank was a market-maker.
Q

Is th'&r©- any showing of how somebody from Illinois

would know about the availability of this stock for sale in a
little village in Utah?
MR. BERTOCH%
knew about it.

I don't know how the man in Illinois

Now, the Circuit Court of Appeals said that Gale,

I mention this because I think this is my most
If there’s a violation, .-it’s here.

That when he bought five shares from Glen Read, the
circuit puts it that he road©, they think, both a misrepresenta­

Ho bought the shares for $350 and ho sold them,

asometiros later, to another white-man for $530.

This is ten

Now, as the circuit says, and I certainly won’t

said;

And then the circuit

However, there is no evidence, even if this is a mis­

representation and a non-disclosure, which would b© in 'violation
of 10b-5, there is no evidence that there was. reliance her©, that
this was the cause,

this misrepresentation or this non­

disclosure was the cause ©f th© sal®.
Now, that — I'll go on with that, except I want to
put Haslem in focus here, too, because there is something that
h® did that th® circuit said might also have bean a violation.
They said that if Haslera indicated when h© purchased soma
stock that that was th© market pries, he mad® a misrepresenta­
tion e
However, with Easlem, there is no evidence in the
record that ho ever sold it to anybody ©Is© at any profit.
So there cannot be found to be a violation of 10b-5 as far as
ho8 s concerned«
But now going back to Mr. Gal©, the question — we
get down to th® real question that is raised by th© Securities

the real bon© of contention in this matter.

reliance to be assumed, if the representation or th© non­
disclosure is material?
Wow# the reason we brought that up is because of
th© case of Mills vs, Auto-Lifee# which is a case decided by
this Court last year# and it5s a case which deserves attention
on this subject»
It is a case which I believe is right, and with which
I do not quarrel at all.

It is just that th® facts ax®

entirely different in that c&s® and this one*
In the Auto-hits case, you will recall, it was a
matter of minor stockholders suing as a class to set aside a
merger, on th© grounds that a statement and a proxy — a proxy
statement failed to disclose -that those of the merging
corporation, th® directors of the merging corporation who
sent out th© proxies war© completely controlled by the
corporation into which it was to be merged.
And so the lower courts — well, as a matter of fact,
there war© thousands, according to Justice Harlan’s opinion.
There were thousands of stockholders involved? arid these were
minority stockholders.
in the circuit court;

And th© problem was, in the trial and
how are we going to determine whether

or not. they relied on the non-disclosure or they ware
influenced by the on-disclosure in the proxy statement?
Whether or not they would have voted otherwise# had this fact
been included in that statement?

And the circuit court, you recall, cam® up with a,
rather fictitious formula, saying, well, this is a tough thing

So we will

If it. appears from the evidence that the

Well, this Court, and I think quit© properly, said?
that doesn't prove anything and we're not going to accept that

MR. BERTOCHs

It started as a class action, Mr.

extensive than the common problems, and so then, in conference,
counsel with Judge Christensen, it was decided that w© should

MR. BERTOCHs

There are some common issues? that is

a representation the court in hist v.ra. Fashion Park, Second
Circuit, says;
"The proper test is whether the plaintiff would have
been influenced to act differently than ha did act if the
defendant had disclosed to him the undisclosed fact."
Now, that's in the css® of a non-disclosure.

In the

said;

They set what they thought the

measure of damage should be.

They said the cases to be

considered are those cases where a mixed-blood sold to Gale or
to Mas lent, and the measure of damages is how much — the
difference between what they sold to Gale and how much Gale
got from somebody else.

Now, let's — if an individual comes in and

wants to sell his stock and the Bank, an employee of th© Bank
is going to buy it himself at a certain price, and he knows

If the Bank knows that there's a thousand-dollar

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PARKER M. NIELSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NIELSONS

Thank you.

Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it please the Courts
Before I get into my argument as such, I might,
comment, for the benefit of Mr. Justice Stewart, that this
term "bellwether" is not a legal term as such, it's a sheep-

54
herder's term is what it is,

It refers to the fact that when

the sheephcrder discovers what -the lead sheep is , the one that
the other members of the flock follow, why, he ties a ball
around it, and than of course if it's dark or the weather i®
bad or something of teat sort, why, he can follow the sheep.
This really is a procedure which Judge Christensen has devised
to handle these — it's just another device to handle
Q

As cattlemen put balls on cows,

MR. NIELSON:

— multiple ~ Right.

Right.

Now, I not® from Mr. Randolph's argument teat h© had
nothing to ©ay about the Securities aspect of the case.

I

remind the Court, however, as I think the Court is aware, that
the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken & position
in this case.

I think it's regrettable that Mr. Randolph did

not speak to that issue, because I know that this Court has
expressed the attitude in the past, in cases such as the
National Sacuritlea case, that it is not desirable to decide
thes© important securities issues without receiving the benefit
of the thinking of the Securities end Exchange Commission.
However, they have appeared by way of their amicus
brief, and I invite the Court to pay careful attention to the
position which they have taken and which, 2 might say, X
subscribe to completely.

As, far as this matter of the legends on the stock,
which Mr. Bertoch referred to, and indicated that the stock was

55
locked up i» th© bank at th© request of th® corporation, 1 think
this Court ought to consider for a moment just what vms going
on hara»
Why would they ©v@r ©van put that, legend on th® stock
if it vrasn’t going to b© given to th© stockholder, so that he
could read it and understand it? why would they take the
position that these people were fully competent and capable of
managing their affairs and that they should b@ held to ‘the
strict standards of accountability that Mr, Randolph would
now like to impose upon them, and still at th© same time taka
•fch© position that they weren’t even competent to handle that
piece of paper?
115s almost as if there was some guilty knowledge
involved here.

It’s almost as if that legend .was printed on

the stock to try to mitigate the circumstances that these
people were being placed under.

Certainly that's the view that

th© petitioners take, and we feel that there was a complete
abdication of responsibilities hare that gives rise to liability
on tli® part of both th© Bank and th® United States •
Now, with respect to this matter of reliance, 1 don't
think we can gloss over th© matter of reliance as easily as
Mr. Bertoch would like to, and say that, well, it just ought to
b© an element ©f th® Rule? it ought to b® an element ©f the
statute.

Because if we look at the statute, the construction

of tne statute and th© construction ©f th© Rule, it seems that

56
Congress had a particular thing in mind.
Congress, if it meant to say reliance, knew how to
say that.

And did so in other contexts.

I have directed the

Court's attention in my brief t© the provisions ©f Section 18
of the very same Act that we’re talking about.
Q

Now, Section —

Do you suggest, then, that List is wrongly

decided?
MR. NIBLSONs

I think that the Commission's position

in the List case was substantially right, that, as I recall,
thay took the position that it. was not really a problem in
Liat as a factual matter.

I have cited in my petition for

certiorari, the brief that the SEC filed in the List case, in
which they took the vary position that I am now espousing,
which is that reliance should not be an element because it leads
to confusing doctrines.
How are you going to prove the negative of these
undisclosed facts?

That’s what Mr. Bertoch suggests that we

should do when wa g© back to the trial court.

How am:' I going

to ask one of these people if they railed upon something they
didn’t know about?
You s®e, that's the problem you get into, and that’s
why reliance is not. an appropriate concept.
But in Section 18, which deals with reports filed
with the Commission, there is cause of action that was prescribed
there for people who rely upon statements contained in thos©

57
reports,

How, that“a the very same Act, and in that context

Congress said that you've got to show reliance.
Also in Section 11(a) ©f the 1933 Securities Act,
which this Court has held is in pari materia. Congress said
that when a person bring© an action, based upon a prospectus
he must show reliance.
Hew, in this Act, in Section 10 Congress didn't say
*reliance", they substituted somathing else. They said what
you've got to show is that it was material.
How, "material." is a very nice limiting factor, too.
And, as Mr. Bertoch ha© correctly pointed out, sometimes it
means the same thing as reliance and sometimes it doesn't.
But that is the term which Congress selected.
«a® that this Court should apply.

1 think it's the

And I think that it isn't

the business of this Court to be writing terms into the statute
which Congress didn't put there, particularly when it appears
in the context that Congress know how to supply that term if
they thought that it should be an element of th® cause.
Mow, I'd like to turn to the Indian law aspects of
this ease, and I'd like to start off by making reference fee
th© dialogue between Mr. Justice White and Mr. Randolph
• relative to the authority for th© establishment of th© Ots
Distribution Corporation.
Mr. Randolph indicated that there was statutory
authority for th® formation of th® Ut© Distribution Corporation;

58
I submit that he was in error.
authority.

There was no such statutory

Randolph directed Mr. Justice Whit® to, does not.provide

It provides authority for the

different thing.

Now, that8s quit© a

A membership association is quit© a different

thing from & corporation.
A corporation, fch© stock in a corporation may b©
soldi on© cannot soli his right to membership in such an
unincorporated association.

It3s almost as if one were to form

a corporation for citizens of the United states and then permit
them to sell their citizenship to aliens who would come to
this country.
It's, to me, an absurdity, and X think that Congress
had a definite thing in mind-

by substituting the corporation

for the organization which Congress prescribed, a very substan­
tial change was wrought in the statutory scheme, and it was
one which resulted in the lose to these people.
Now, Mr. Randolph said that it was approved by fch©
Indians.

It was approved at a meeting of a quorum of 30.

Congress said that such an organisation must be approved at
a special meeting called for that purpose by tee Secretary and
by a majority vote of the adult mixed-bloods.
in excess of 30.

That was far

I’m not sure exactly what the number was,

but it was something like about. 140.

39
So, you see, by substituting the procedures under the
plan of distribution and the constitution of AUC for the
procedures which Congress prescribed, the intent of Congress
was emasculated.

Congress said a majority of fch© adult mixed-

bloods .
Instead of doing that, they used the provisions in
feh© constitution which permitted a vote of a mere 30.
Th©r<a8s another important tiling her©, too, Mr.
Justice Whit©, that I think ought to b© considered, and that is
Q

The Act did authorise the mixed-bloods feo form

a — to get together and have a constitution?
MR. NIELSON:

Constitution and bylaws.

Q

And —

Q

It was unincorporated, was it?

MR. NIELSON:

It doesn't

— well, the word

"unincorporated" is not in the statute.

X think that's a fair

construction of it, however.
Q

But it could have b©@n incorporated?

MR. NIELSON * Well, they use the term "corporation"
in other sections:

I suppose that if they meant corporation,

again they knew how to say it, and they said it in Section 13.
The fact that they'said it in Section 13 and they didn't say it
in Section 6 is persuasive that they didn't mean it in Section
6.
There’s another —

60
Q

So that the statute would authorize the

constitution to provide for the selection of authorized
representatives of the Affiliated Ute Citizens?
MR» NIELSON:

That is correct.

And that gets us into

a whole different question, which is brief —
Q

Well, the Tribe was authorised to form — or

th® iaiK©d“bl©ods were authorized to form a constitution.
MR. NIELSON s
Q

Yes.

Arid the statute authorized the constitution to

provide for the .choice of author!sod representatives.
MR. NIELSON:
Q

Yes.

And that was proved —

And your claim is that in using a corporation

as an authorized representative, that was inconsistent with
the statute?
MR. NIELSON:
Mr. Justice White.

If we want to consider it in that way,

I'm not saying, in that sense, that it*s

inconsistent with the statute; I*ai saying that, as a factual
raeeter, it didn't happen.

Because th® constitution and bylaws

provided that the authorized representative powers were those
defined in Article V, Section 1(a), and those powers were never
delegated to anyone•
Thus, if those were th© powers, they still reside
where they originally were placed, with the Affiliated Ute
Citizens.

There is n© showing that there was ever any

delegation of that power.

That's a factual question, however;

61
it's not a legal question.
But the point 1 wanted to get to hare, which 1 think
is maybe even more fundamental than that- and that is simply
this:

this statute provided that upon publication of the rolls,,

ovary terminated Ufce would have his rights in sever&lity,
inheritable and such a condition that they could b© bequeathed.
Mow, that's Section 10.

It says that just as plainly as can

be.
But, at the time ©£ this purported resolution, which
Mr. Randolph refers to, there was no power for the' general
membership to dispose ©£ any particular person's property,
because that had already vested in the individual, including
the beneficial interests in the undivided assets.
I'd like to just road that section, because —
Q

So the whole schema for authorised representa­

tive was just a mirage.
MR. NIELSON:
Q

Mo.

Well, you say the undivided interest vested

directly in the individual.
MR. WXELSONs

Th© beneficial interest.

All right.

no — well, the beneficial
