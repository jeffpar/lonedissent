MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this case, upon the challenge of the respondent
which is an operator of cable television systems in
Missouri, New Mexico, and Texas, the Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit held invalid a rule <£ the Federal
Communications Commission which provides that, a cable
television system having 3500 or more subscribers may:not
in the absence of waiver of the rule by the Commission--ifc
is not stated in the rule but it has become clear in
subsequent reports—may not distribute the signals of'
television broadcast stations unless it "also operates to a
significant extent as a local outlet by cable casting" and
by having available "facilities for local production and
presentation of programs other than automated

services."

Cable casting simply means the providing of
programming on the system without the use of broadcast
signals.

Most cable television service does originate as

4
broadcast programming that the system then brings in through
its antennas.

Cable casting would be programming that it

provides itself rather than from broadcast services.
background of the rule is this.

The

In June of 1368 this Court

in the Southwestern Cable Company decision, 332 U.

s.,

upheld

the FCC's authority to stay cable transmission of distant
broadcast signals into a community pending a hearing, the
situation there involving the 100 largest television markets.
The Court held in that case that cable television systems
engage in interstate communication by wire or radio within
the meaning of Section 2(a) of the Communications Act and
that the systems are therefore subject to the Commission's
regulatory jurisdiction at least to the extent that the
Commission’s regulation is reasonably ancillary, in the
words of the Court, to the effective performance of the
Commission's various responsibilities for the regulation of
television broadcasting.
With uncertainties about the Commission*s
jurisdiction in regulatory authority over cable television
thus dispelled, at least to this'extant,, which I will argue
is basically all we need here, the Commission has undertaken
a major effort to integrate the rapidly burdeoning cable
system into the national communications systems in ways that
will be consistent with and in furtherance of the public
policy objectives of the Communications Act.

s
Since the decision in Southwestern, the Commission
has so far devoted more than three years of intensive study
to cable television in a series of

rulemaking proceedings

which began in December of 1968 with the notice of rule­
making reprinted in the appendix which resulted in the rules
at issue here, and that notice announced that the
Commission would explore "how best to obtain, consistent with
the public interest standard of the Communications Act? the
full benefits of developing communications technology for
the public with particular immediate reference to CATV
technology and potential services.'5
Q

I take it there is nothing expressed in the

act that says that cablecasting

as such is subject to the

Let’s assume, which isn't true,

that a cablecaster carried no broadcast signals, he. just

MR. WALLACE:

There is nothing in the act on that

i n te r s t a te oomrri -:? 2 \ i cat i on s by w i r e ?
MR. WALLACE:
Q

Yes, it does.

If there are common carriers?

MR, WALLACE:

Well, under Southwestern we don't

think that that's limited to common carriers.

But this case

no more than Southwestern requires-—
Q

If there was some real statutory authority,

obvious statutory authority over just wire communications,
we wouldn't have this argument.
MR, WALLACE:

Presumably the Court of Appeals would

have decided the case differently,
Q

I agree with Your Honor—

The Commission would have decided it

differently too.
MR, WALLACE:

Undoubtedly,

The act, as you know,

was enacted in 1934 and has not been amended on this subject.
The Commission is proceeding as best it can.
Q

Has there been any amendment in this area since

cable television emerged as a real—
MR, WALLACE:

Not at all, Your Honor.

In

SouthwesterniCable, the Court reviewed the attempts to amend
the act that up to that time had occurred in Congress and
noted that none of them resulted in the adoption of any
legislation and since that time there has not even been a
bill considered in committee cn this subject, since the
Southwestern decision.

But we think there is some significance

7

in the close- scrutiny that Congress has been giving to the
development of the Commission's rulemaking proceedings in
tills subject.
The Commission has submitted several written
reports to Congress on its cable television rulemaking
endeavors during the period since Sonthwest-arn to the
requisite congressional committees, mostly the communications
subcommittees of the two commerce committees.

And members

of the Commission have at times been quite closely
questioned about these efforts at committee hearings.

While

this is certainly not dispositive of the case f we believe
that it's significant, because of this close scrutiny, that
there has so far been no substantial indication of any
congressional dissatisfaction with the way the Commission
has been performing its task in this area.
Q

Has it been a—well, it!s the ordinary rule-

making function, but has it been a kind of cooperative effort
trying to reach an accommodation among the various competing
interests?
MR. WALLACE:

The Commission has devoted a great

deal of time and effort to that, covering various subjects
in the course of these rulemaking proceedings.

I can broadly

characterize them as the carriage of television broadcast
signals by cable systems and the use of cable television
channels for the distribution of non-broadcast programming,

the main one at issue here, but' also minimum technical
standards for cable television systems, including minimum
channel requirements, two-way transmission capability, and
separate neighborhood program origination centers, and the
whole question of the appropriate distribution of regulatory
jurisdiction between federal and state and local levels of
government, and the question of limitation on local franchise
fees paid by cable systems.

And in the course of these

proceedings over the past three years, more than 700 comments
have been received from various industries, civic and
academic groups, and there were two lengthy rounds of oral
presentations and panel discussions held by the Commission,
involving more than 200 participants, one round in February,
IS69 before the orders at issue here were adopted, and another
round in March of 1971.

Altogether ten full

on these hearings and panel discussions.

days were spent

And following the

1971 consideration, the Commission in February of 1972 adopted,
a much more comprehensive set of rules on this subject than
the rules at issue here.

We have lodged ten copies of these

with the Court in this case.

In

addition to the reference materials that are

cited in the brief on the subject, there is a very lengthy
and comprehensive article on the subject coming out in the
forthcoming issue, the April issue, of the 'Metre Dame Lawyer
which should be brought to the Court’s attention, an article

9
by Professor Stephen Barnett of the University of California
Law School, which discusses very comprehensively the new
rules and also the issues .involved in the question of the
Commission’s jurisdictionQ

And the so-called new rules are these? as of

this February?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

You'll find after the initial part of it, which is
the report and order discussing them, on page 3278, if you
have it with you there, there is an index to the rules
themselves, which gives you some idea of the scope of them.
1 might add that while Professor Barnett does take
issue on policy grounds with some of the conclusions the ■
Commission has reached, he does say that in his view there is?
jurisdiction
The 1968 rules challenged in this case have three
general aspects, to get back to the rules at issue here.

And

these were summarized—this case is only under the 1969 rules,
which had three general aspects summarized in Commissioner
Bartley’s concurring statement at the time of the adoption
of the rule.

That is in the appendix to the petition.

covered petition.

On pages 55 and 56.

They

At the bottom of

page 55, Commissioner Barf 1-ay very briefly summarized what
was involved in the rules that were challenged in this case.
One is the provision the cable system may originate programs

10
without limitation as to number of channels.
on Januax-

And beginning

?ith 3500 or more subscribers is

required to originate programs to a significant extent or else
it is forbidden to carry broadcasting.
And then his B and C apply to the program originated
the cablecasting programs.

One was provisions that they may

sell advertising with respect to such

programs to be

presented only at natural breaks or intermissions in the
programs.

And C is this programming that they originatet

this cablecasting is required generally to comply with the
equal opportunity and fairness doctrine provisions and.
sponsorship identification provisions of the Communications
Act and of the rules.
The respondent here challenged all three aspects.
The Court of Appeals held that the program origination
requirement is invalid and then refused to pass on the
validity of the remaining rules on the ground that the
respondent lacks standing to challenge them since it did not
intend to originate any programming once the origination
requirement was struck down.
So, the only question before this Court is the
validity of the origination or cablecasting requirement.
The respondent correctly points out that no cablecasting was
involved, in the Southwestern case.

And 1 have already mentioned

that the rule at issue here applies only to systems that

11
carry broadcast signals, not to the presently non-existent
possibility of a system that does nothing but cablecasting.
So, there is no need for the Court in this case to reach any
question of the Commission's jurisdiction over cablecasting
as it stands alone.
Q

Will you tell me again what cablecasting is?

MR. WALLACE:

That is programming over the cable

that does not involve any broadcast signals or any broadcast
originating programs—
Q

Wholly originated then.

MR. WALLACE:

Wholly originated by the cahlecaster,

although it may not necessarily be local programming.

It

can he programming fchatfs supplied to him from elsewhere,
including networking possibilities here.

But it would not

be programming that originates through radio signals that
are being broadcast to other viewers.

It could foe

programming that is sent to him by radio signals that are
not really broadcast signals that go to the public.
Q

That no independent TV sets can receive,

MR. WALLACE:
Q

That is correct, sir.

Then the origination doesn't really have

controlling impact here, does it?

It could originate in a

network in New York and be delivered in Omaha, Nebraska by
cable, could it not?
MR. WALLACEt

That is a possibility,

The rule

12
contemplates that some of this -origination requirement could
be met by networking or other interconnected - programming,
although there is a requirement that there be local
facilities available,
Q

But the primary emphasis is to encourage

local production?
MR, WALLACE:

That is correct. Your Honor»

But

there is also the possibility of this networking , including
the use of satellites, which has been discussed in the course
of these rulemaking proceedings as a possible way of
networking cablecasting.

It’s not the primary purpose of

the rule, but a substantial part of the cable system's
obligations could be fulfilled by use of these services, and
it’s one consideration that we think should be taken into
account with respect to the Commission's authority here,
although it's not the basic, the heart of the Commission’s
rationale here.
All of the programs, whether broadcast originated
or not, are supplied by cable systems as they exist today to
their subscribers over the same cable.

And from the

standpoint of the viewer turning the dial from one channel
to another, cablecasting offered by the system is for all
practical purposes undifferentiated from the other services
being offered and indeed from broadcast services that he
receives.

For this reason we think it fairly clear that under

13
the ancillary standard, reasonably ancillary standard of
Southwestern Cable, the Commission must have some
authority to regulate cablecasting service; because if the
system were free to ignore its cablecasting, the fairness,
equal opportunity sponsorship identification requirements
that otherwise existed on the set, their overall effect would
be quite seriously undermined and there is also the problem
of the possible use of pay cablecasting.

This would be a

per program or per service fee rather than
subscription for hooking into the cable.

just the
And the concerns

that the Commission has had about the siphoning off through
pay television of programming that is now available free
to viewers could very well be undermined if pay cablecasting
could come in and perform the same siphoning off of pro­
gramming the Commission were powerless to regulate.
Q

Is all cable television pay television?

MR. WALLACE:
Q

It comes into your home by wire.

MR. WALLACE:
Q

Not the kind that I’m talking about.

There is a subscription fee.

It's a pay television then.

MR. WALLACE:

In that sense.

But now I'm talking

about the additional element of a per service or per program
fee,that you can't get the particular program unless you pay
a particular fee for it such as we have with pay broadcast
television.

14
Q

X noticed that Judge Gibson was somewhat

exercised about the problems of advertising.

Is there

advertising, on cable television?
MR. WALLACE:

Advertising—there isn't with respect

to the broadcast programming -that is carried.
Q

But not on those—

MR. WALLACE:

It is now—they just carry the

advertising that is already put on the air by the broadcaster.
Q

If they pick it up from a network or some

other station and then run it by cable into the private
home„ they take it as it is.
HR. WALLACEs

As it is, and they don’t interfere

with the advertising that is on.
Q

But the cable television as such does not

introduce advertising on the wire; is that right?
MR. WALLACE:

In their cablecasting operations the

Commission has authorised them to introduce advertising, but
only at natural breaks in the programming.
authorized to interrupt the programming»
that are now engaging in

They are not.
And those systems

their own originated programming.
Q

Does that mean that viewers are going to pay a

fee to get advertising piped into their homes and televisions?
MR. WALLACE:

They all do operate with subscribers’

Rut, of course, to the extent that they're programming

15
costs can be defrayed through advertising, they are then able
to reduce subscription fees, and the Commission considered
these matters and decided to authorise advertising to that
limited extent with cablecasting«
Q

Does that include political advertising?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, they have the option to carry

it just as broadcasters do.
Q

Is there anything to stop the cable television

company that operates in three counties of a state from
during the month of October carrying nothing but political
advertising?
MR. WALLACE:

There is nothing to stop them if they

choose to limit their advertising that w&y.

They do have the

fairness doctrine requirements and equal opportunity
requirements to comply with in the Commission's view and
under the Commission's rules, if the Commission has
authority to apply them.
they do.

And, of course, we contend that

But the question here is whether the Commission
\

had authority to apply the origination requirement to
cablecasters, to cable systems, that would prefer not to
any cablecasting.

That is the issue here.

do

And while we do

not concede that the reasonably ancillary standard of
Southwestern sets the outer limit of the Commission's
authority with respect to cable television, our position
that that standard is mat with respect to the origination

requirement also, which brings me now to the rationale of the
Commission, which is at the heart of this requirement that
they have imposed,

^

This Court in Southwestern recognised the
legitimacy of the Commission’s concern that local broadcast
service not be destroyed or foreclosed by unregulated
importation of distant, broadcast signals on cable systems,
and there are two reasons for this concern.

One is the

importance to the public of programming that deals with
local issues of public importance which can only reasonably
be anticipated on local service.

And the other reason is the

very practical problem that cable systems dc not serve many
persons in their area who are served by local broadcasting,
both because some of these persons cannot or will not pay
the subscription fees and because it is prohibitively
expensive tc extend the cable to these who are in rural areas
or other sparsely populated areas.
The development of cablecasting on these systems,
however, offers in the Commission's view compensating
opportunities for service to the community that cannot
otherwise be made available, both because it overcomes the
physical limitations of the broadcast spectrum on program
diversity’- and because it offers new possibilities for
specialized, local service.
For'example, if you have a system that brings New

,

I?
York City signals into a small community in Pennsylvania, as
we do, or you could just as well use a system bringing
Denver signals into small communities in Colorado or in
Wyoming, as we havef you have an illustration of the sort of
thing that X mean.

It may be that the ability of the local

broadcasters to continue serviing the small community and
other small communities in the area will be threatened by
the importation of these signals, and perhaps other
communities will also have their own cable systems.

But it

is also true that the cable systems which now—now they have
up to 20 channels on the cable--can provide many services to
the subscribers in this local community that really can't,
as a practical matter, be performed by broadcasters because
they serve only a very local community.
It's quite possible for the two candidates for
mayor to have a debate on one of the cablecasting channels
or a panel discussion to be held on local school board
problems or other matters of particular local concern.

It's

even possible for small merchants who want only a local
audience to advertise to, to have available to them facilities
that really are not available through broadcasting.
Q

There is no grandfather clause here?

MR. WALLACE;

There, are some grandfather provisions

involved but they are not at issue in the present case.
Q

There may be plenty of reasons for this, but

18

is it your submission in terms of power that because the
cablecaster dees use broadcast signals, that gives the FCC
power to order him or to control the rest of his program or
to supervise the content of the rest of his programs?
MR. WALLACE:

Our submission is that the power

derives basically from the fact that these systems do use
broadcast signals and what the Commission has concluded here
is that the impairment or the threat, the possible threat
here to television service that results from the Commission's
authorization of the use of the radio signals, that is, the
sustenance of these systems is offset, is sufficiently
compensated for by the new services to the community

the

cablecasting can provide so that it's only in light of both
aspects of the operation that the Commission is willing to
go ahead and authorise the services to the extent that they
have to use radio signals»
Q

where you have a voluntary cablecaster— and X

suppose are there are some—
MR. WALLACE:
Q

There are, yes.

—-a voluntary cablecaster originating programs

but also carrying broadcast signals, I take it you would say
automatically that the FCC has power to apply the fairness
doctrine right across the board.

Assume they had 20 channels

and they filled them all up and not only with broadcast signals
but with origination.

Do you think you could reach the

19

originating program, the fairness of the originating
programs, just because of the use of some broadcast signals?
MR. WALLACE:

The Commission’s rule does apply.

In

that case it’s largely because of the impact on the viewer.
To him the differentiation of whether it’s coming in as cablecasting or as broadcasting is not all that apparent as he
flips from one station to another.
Q

That may be true, but what about the

Commission's power and authority?
MR. WALLACE:

If the fairness doctrine is to

operate effectively or if the equal opportunity provisions
are to operate effectively, what is the Commission to do if
the cablecasting is all going to feature people from one
party?

Should the Commission then say that in compensation

for that that the broadcasters must weight their presentations
in favor of the other party.

It seems to the Commission

that the idea is to get an overall effect that’s fair through
the television set.
Q

Assume the non-existent cablecaster who

doesn’t use broadcast signals and assume that the Commission
had power over that broadcaster to license him or that
cablecaster.

Would you think the fairness doctrine would

have the same basis constitutionally as--MR. WALLACE:

The Commission has not attempted to

apply it that far, and that would present a much more

20
difficult question.

But at least the viewer there would

tend to be more aware that he’s listening only to someone who
is coming in with a cablecasting operation.

As it is now,

he is served by a single cable that presents a mixture of
broadcast originated programming where these protections
apply, and the other—he’s not very aware of which he is
getting at any given moment,
Q

Do you think the Fortnightly Corporation

decision has any relevance to the issues here?
HR. WALLACE;
respect.

I think it has relevance in this

Of course, it only decided whether there is

copyright infringement.

a

But it does indicate—it seems to

me that it goes somewhat, to the reasonableness of the
Commission's rule, and I am obviously not. going to have time
to discuss that issue at any length.

I think it's well

developed in the course of the appendix here, the
consideration that the Commission gave to financial
arguments resulting ultimately in the waiver that they
provided.

But the fact is broadcasters who do have to pay

for networking in other programs that they receive and who
do not receive any fees from their subscribers are all
required by the Commission to provide local service of a
public interest nature.

When it comes to the reasonableness

of the rule, what the Commission has done here is to say the
cahlecasfcers, who now have the capacity to provide additional

21
kinds of local service that are not available through
broadcasting should be required to do the same sort of thing
when they have the financial capacity to do so, and the
Commission has been very cautious on the question of the
financial capacity rather than just exist in a parasitic
relationship to broadcasting.

Q

Mr. Wallace, at that point we do have this

demarcation of 3500 subscribers, do we not?
ME. WALLACE:
Q

That is correct.

X suppose my question is, Is there anything

arbitrary about the 3500 mark?
MR, WALLACE:

It was developed in the course of

very lengthy considerations that are rehearsed quite a bit
in the appendix to the petition, if I may just refer you to
the relevant pages.

First is pages 38 through 45 of the

appendix in which the Commission originally arrived at that
figure on the basis of detailed information that was
submitted to it and especially noting that more than 70 percent
of the cablecasters now in existence of those systems now
cablecasting have less than 3500 subscribers and also in
light of the flexibility of their rules, they are not
required in order to meet this rule to engage in a high-cost
operation.

The chart on page 40 of the appendix to the

petition indicates that it's possible to get down to what's
called a small monochrome system or a minimum monochrome system.

It is much less costly for those who don't really have the
financial resources to do better.

And then if 1 may add

references to pages 58 and 59 where the Commission considered
this further on motion for reconsideration.

And then finally

on pages 66 and 67 of the appendix to the petition in which
the Commission set up procedures for waiver and said that
any system with less than 10,000 subscribers, when it applies
for a waiver, will get an automatic stay until the waiver
situation is clarified, until the waiver decision is made.
The Commission has been very cautious on the
question of financial capacity and burden here.
Q

As I read Judge Gibson's recurring opinion,

at least, he. doesn't question FCC power in the broadest sense.
I note in his opinion he uses the phrase "at this time at
least" perhaps three times in his opinion, and he addresses
himself to the particular order so that this question really
doesn't go to power but to the discretion of the Commission
in exercising pervasive power at this particular time and in
the particular way.
MR. WALLACE:

If I may say so, Your Honor, it reads

to me like a dissenting opinion of a Commissioner to this
report and order, rather than an opinion on review.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. WALLACE*.

Thank you, Mr. Wallace. .

Thank you, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY M. PLOTKIH, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PLOTKIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may .it please

the Court:
Essentially a very simple issue is involved here,
not the very complex issue that Mr. Wallace refers to,
because most of the things that he talks about are either
rules and regulations that have been adopted since this case
was before the court of the law and as to which the
administrative process has not yet even been completed and
the other aspect of which is what happens with voluntary
origination.

The rules and regulations of the Commission

"were not passed upon by the court of the lav/ before this
Court.
What's involved here is a simple requirement of
the Commission that says to a CATV system, "If you want to
stay in business as a CATV system, you've got to originate
programs.
effect.

You’ve got to become a broadcast station, in
If you refuse to do that, you’ve got to cease being

a CATV system."
And I think it might be helpful if I just backed
up a little bit and gave a little bit of history of CATV so
as to show how it fills in with respect to what the
Commission has done in this case.
CATV started when television broadcast stations

were not able to fill in and provide service to the entire
service area, principally communities located in valleys
where there are mountains in between the television antenna and
the community; whereas the television signal might extend for
miles

beyond this particular community, there on the bottom

they were unable to receive the television signals.
So, individual entrepreneurs undertook to put an
antenna on top of the mountain where the signal is available,
catch it, bring it down by cable into the community and
to distribute it.

then

It started off originally people doing it

for themselves and then making it available to their
neighbors and they suddenly realise that when their neighbors
came around, that this was a sort of service that everybody
wanted to have and it became a business, that they would
charge people for the opportunity of being able to get
television service that otherwise was not available.

While

the rates for this service tend to vary throughout the
United States, mostly they’re now between a low of four and
ahigh of six dollars per month for this service.
As the institution developed, what happened was in
some communities they did have their own television stations,
but maybe only had one or two.

By means of CATV, sometimes

by bringin in the signals by a high antenna or sometimes by
microwave, you were able to bring in the three networks and
maybe independent stations.

So that whereas people could get

some free television in their communities

from the one or

two stations there, they were willing to pay this four to

C'

dollars a month for the ability to be able to get three,
four, five, or sis? signals, which were distributed over the
same cable.
Initially the

Federal Communications Commission

paid no attention to this phenomenon; neither did the
broadcasting stations.

Quite to the contrary, the

broadcast stations were very happy with what CATV was doing
because it was really filling out the service area in a way
that, if geography and terrain had not intervened, the signal
would be available.

And obviously the more people who were

able to receive the signal, the better for the broadcast
station, .because the broadcast station was able to sell
advertising on the basis of its circulation.
But as this started to proliferate and the
Commission even said initially that it had no jurisdiction
over the subject matter—-but as it started to proliferate
and as the importation of signals tended to create an
economic problem for some of the existing television stations,
because obviously if you8re the only television station in
town with no CATV, you have a captive audience; people either
listen to you or don't listen to anyone at all.

But when CATV

brought in signals from two, three, or four stations, it
fractionated the audience.

People were given a program choice.

26

This is what the law and the policy of our government demands,
but obviously the local broadcaster was unhappy because ha
was losing his monopoly.

So, they began to complain to the

Commission about this process» and the Commission undertook to
regulate CATV systems to the extent that they imported
signals.

They adopted basically two types of rules and

regulations on the subject.

One was a rule and regulation

that said that a CATV system must carry all local systems.
In other words, if the signal is locally available
in the community, the CATV system must put it on its
system.

This seems

self-evident, but at least at the

outset whan CATV systems got started and when capacity on the
CATV system was rather limited, the local station was not a
particularly attractive commodity and the CATV system-would
bring in signals from outside that were more salable and the
local station therefore would tend to have difficulty in
getting an audience

once a person was on a cable? the local

station wasn’t on the cable.

That subscriber would have

difficulty in getting a local station.
So, the Commission said as a minimum matter you must
carry all -local signals so as to make sure that the local
station

is not prejudiced.
Secondly, the Commission said that we will restrict

the importation of distant signals, since distant signals
corse into the market and tend to fractionate the audience.

It might cause a problem so far as the local station is
concerned.

We will restrict it to make sure that you don't

overdo it.

We will undertake to strike a balance so as to

make sure that you are able to bring in enough signals so
that when added to the local signals people get adequate
service.

By that they generally meant that they are able to

get service at least from the three networks.

But beyond tha

they wouldn't permit it.
That was challenged, and ultimately this Court, in
Southwestern, did sustain the authority of the Commission to
adopt such rules and regulations because these rules and
regulations were ancillary to the Commission's authority
with respect to broadcasting.

CATV systems, the Commission

held and this Court agreed, are engaged in communication by
wire or radio within the meaning on the air.

And while they

are not broacast stations themselves, they are an instru­
mentality, a medium—
Q

That’s because they are carrying broadcast

signals?
MR. PLOTKXNs

That's because they’re carrying

broadcast signals, that’s right. :
Q

Even though at the tail end they are carrying

them by wire?
MR. PLOTKIN:

That's right.

They are really

performing no different function in that respect than you do

in your own heme when you put an antenna on top of your roof»

This is obviously a much more sophisticated wire.
are doing the same thing.

But you

They were also capturing the.

signal on the antenna and distributing over a long wire to
many people.
G

Did Southwestern uphold the power of the

Commission to force the cable TV’s to carry things they
didn't want to?
MR. PLOTKIN:

No.

That wasn't even involved.

Quite

the contrary, when-"
Q

What about the order to carry local stations.

MR, PLOTKIN:
Q

To carry what?

That the cable operators had to carry all local

stations even though they didn't want to.
MR. PLOTKIN;

Yes, that was what was involved there;

the Commission said that it's part of our authority—
Q

I know, but was that involved in Southwestern?

MR. PLOTKIN:
Q

The rule was involved in that case.

It was upheld?

MR. PLOTKIN:

That particular one wasn't challenged

but in another case which Midwest had brought in the Eighth
Circuit where that rule was challenged, the Eighth Circuit
did uphold that regulation and so the courts have upheld—

Q

Do you challenge that as well?

MR. PLQTKIN:
Q

Yes

If your position were sustained, would you say

the Commission couldn't force the cable TV people to carry
all local stations?
ME, PLOTKIN:

That's the position we took several

years ago,, and. we were not able to persuade the courts that
that was correct.

The reason we took that, just for a little

history, was this is a reception service and the Commission
only had jurisdiction over transmission service.

The courts

have agreed with the commission on that and said you can
adopt rules and regulations—*
Q

But I just wondered if your position were

sustained, would it also invalidate that rule?
MR. PLOTKIN:

No.

In this case, not at all.

Not

\

only would it not invalidate that rule, but it wouldn't
invalidate the rules and regulations that the Commission has
adopted that say that if you voluntarily originate, you have/
to comply with the fairness doctrine, you have to comply

/

with the lottery law, with all the other rules and regulations
with respect, to this.

There are difficult legal questions

I think that Your Honor was adverting to in questioning
Mr. Wallace as to whether there

is not constitutional

queasiheas about that.- but that’s not involved here.
Q

What is the collision, if any, with ,the stats

systems of regulation?

30

MR. PLOTEXNi

The states—the Commission is

undertaking in many areas to preempt the area of state
regulation,
Q

The states are fighting that.
Is that involved in this case?

MR. PLOTKXN:

The State of Illinois has filed a

brief amicus in this Court in which they assert that it is
involved.

I don't think it is involved myself, and 2 don't

think that the government feels that it's involved.

But

the states at least see where, it's leading to and getting
into this problem early.

I don't think this particular rule

and regulation does involve the divisions of authority
between the federal and state authorities,.

We think that

the power that compels someone to go into a business that he
doesn't want to, the state would like that power—•
Q

What I’m getting at, does any stata have

regulations covering origination?
MR. PLOTKIN:

Some of the municipalities—you have

to get a franchise from a municipality to operate a CATV
system because your wires cross? over alleys and streets.
Some of those franchises require the CATV operator to
originate programs„
Q

They would fall under this regulation?

MR. PLOTKIN:

Not automatically, because we think

that what's involved here is an absence of statutory
authority.with constitutional overtones, but we don’t think

31
you've reached a constitutional problem because there is
absence of statutory authority»

But the constitutional

overtones argument is involved; the same constitutional
limitations would be applicable in municipalities as
appli cable to the federal government.

But that is not

involved here because X think we don’t reach that; the
Commission has not been given this authority by Congress»
Whether Congress could give it the authority is not entirely
a clear question and would depend^entirely on the type of
statute that Congress drafted, the type of findings they
made as to whether they could—what would be involved»
that’s not involved here.

But

We think it very clear that Congress

has not given the PCC authority with respect to that.
What Congress did give the Commission authority so
far as reception activities are concerned is that you can
adopt rules and regulations rather reasonably insulated to
your regulation of broadcast stations.

And, for example,

with respect to your mandatory carriage of all local signals
since the Commission in Section 303(a) and 303(h) of the
Communications Act provides that the Commission has the
authority to classify radio stations and to prescribe the
areas to be served by them, well, obviously .it1 s ancillary
to their jurisdiction, says the court, for the Commission tc
require a local CATV system to carry local signals; because
if they don't, the area that the Commission has prescribed

or a broadcast -.■■t.s.t.ion is cut off.

By the same token, when

the Commission says that you shall not import distant signals
beyond where they are intended to be carried—for example,
if you®re operating a system in Casper, Wyoming, and you are
trying to import a signal from Denver, Colorado, it’s
obviously extending that signal beyond' the area which the
Commission prescribed that station is to serve.

The

'

Commission under certain circumstances did permit those
signals to be imported but only for the purpose of making
sure that the people in Riverton, Wyoming have enough
reception services.
So, that is the theory upon which the Commission
upheld authority in the Southwestern case because it was
reasonably ancillary to broadcast jurisdiction over
television stations.
Q

. In some of the maintainous areas out .West

they can't get television without this.
MR. jpLOTKIWs

That’s right.

<
That's right.

And

i

this is why this does perform a very important public interest
function.

And when they do perform their function of inter­

state communication by wire or radio, they are subject to the
jurisdiction that Congress has given to the Commission, to
make sure that it carries out the policies of regulating
broadcast station and is not inconsistent

therewith.

A CATV system in its essence is a very, very

33
3imple

matter.

It erects an antenna, cables come down and

distribute it to the people who pay four to six dollars a
month for that service.

The problem was relatively simple,

the personnel involved were relatively few in number and
unsophisticated personnel; people who string cables and
maintain cables, who hook up television receivers; and a
small billing department that goes on and bills the people
four to six dollars a month and collects it.
Sow, the Commission comes along and says CATV
operates in many small comunities that don't have their own
television station.
television stations?

Wouldn't it be nice if these had
And, therefore, the Commission said

that if you9re going to stay in business, since you're using
broadcast signals, if you're going to stay in the business
of providing broadcast stations, we want to—not only want
to, demand—that if you have 3500 or more subscribers, that
you must also become a broadcast station, and that's what
cablecasting means.

You must become a broadcast station.

You must originate your own programs.

You must have

facilities available for local programs and you must
originate it.
This is an entirely different business activity
from what CATV is involved in.
Q

Do you say that the Commission could never

require that development it's now reaching for here?

34
HR,. PLOTKIKs

Under the statute that Congress

adopted. they do not have the statutory authority.

Q

That is

Under any circumstances.

MR. PLOTKIH:

Under any of the present statutes.

Under present statutes they’re not.
I should point out to Your Honor that in a somewhat
related field, to wit, when television receivers were first
being marketed, they were being marketed with VHP channels
only even though there was both VHP and. UKF channels, the
television receivers were being marketed with VHF channels
only.

And the Commission argued that television was not

getting.off the ground so far as

UHF was concerned.

The

Commission went to Congress to get a statute passed that said
that if you manufacture television receivers, you must make
sure that they have all the channels.

The Commission felt

the need of going to Congress and getting some specific
statutory authority.

Desirable as the objective was, they

felt powerless to do anything about it without getting it
from the national Congress,

The need to

go to Congress to

get authority in this field is very, very clear, in the
reception field, where they have—where they had to get a
statute, Section 303, passed which specifically authorises
the Commission to prevent in shipment in interstate commerce
a television receiver unless it carries both VHF and UIIF so

35
that the entire spectrum can be utilized.
What the PCC is telling to a CATV system is you
must become a broadcaster.

The

Commission now comes to say, "Pine, you’re a CATV operator.
But we new want you to enter into an entirely different
business activity front you yourself undertook to do."
That’s what’s involved when you take origination.
The Commission in effect says that if you’re located in a
small community, even where there is no other television
station involved so you’re not having an impact on them, and
if you have 5000 subscribers, important as your service is
of bringing television service to those people who might not

38
MR. PLOTKIN:

If you remember the question that

Mr. Justice White ashed. What is the nature of the undertaking
of the Commission's jurisdiction?

And I'd like to address

myself to the quintessence of the question that we use
broadcast signals, because there's an implication—not an
implication but a direct statement of the Commission—that
there is a benefit conferred since we use broadcast signals.
But basically this is not a parasitic or exploitation
relationship.

It's a symbiotic relationship.

Broadcast

signals, when they're transmitted over the air, are worthless
unless there is something on the other end to receive them
and make use of it.

We are just as much a part of it, not

as a recipient of a benefit but as part of the symbiotic
process, as it were.

And we're no different than the local

dealer that makes television sets to make them available to
the people so that they can receive the broadcast.

Obviously

if no one is making broadcasts, there would be no market for
sets.
But, by the same token, if no one were making sets,
there would be no purpose in transmitting signals over the
air.

It's a duality of the process.
To tell us that just because we utilise broadcast

signs* la in a manner in which they are' intended to be
utilized and in a manner in which, unless we did something
with them they wouldn't be useful at all, that therefore we

39
should now undertake to become a broadcast

station in effect

is to be able to tell the manufacturer of television
receivers or to sell television receivers, "Since you are
making use of broadcast signals, you ought to do something.
You ought to go and open a broadcast station in your town."
We’re undertaking part of the process.

The

Commission has certain jurisdiction over one part of the
process and another type of jurisdiction over the other part
of the process.

Nowhere has Congress given the Commission

the power to say that if you do part of the process you also
must do another part of the process.
It's like in the case of Frost & Frost where we
cited in effect—where the State of California told this
gentleman, "If you want to use our roads, you've got to be
not just a private contractor; you must be a common carrier
for hire."

And the Supreme Court said, "No, you can make

reasonable regulations relating to the use of the road.
may even forbid the use of the road.

You

But you can’t say that

if you utilize the road, if you at the same time say that
since you're utilizing the road, you become a common carrier
even though that’s not what you intended to dedicate your
property to."
Q

Isn't the Commission saying here, Mr. Plotkin6

that in order to perform and fulfill your total public
function, you must do these additional things?

40

MR. PLQTKIN:

That’s what they're trying to say,

and I’m not saying that it's an unworthy thing that they’re
trying to do.

But in effect they are telling us who only

want to bring in—-to manufacture and sell receivers, to
install receivers, since we are performing that function, we
ought to do something else.
Q
receivers.

You are doing a little more than installing
You’re operating a system, the last stage of

which is installing a receiver.
MR. PLOTKIN:

That’s right.

If Congress had said

that this whole business of installing as a new business,
that if you install and so forth, that as part of that there
ought to be certain responsibilities
another thing.

to it, that could be

But so far as our function is concerned--and

as this Court pointed out in Fortnightly, true from a copy­
right point of view--what we do is perform the reception
part of this and not the transmission part.

It’s an entirely

different activity that they're asking us to do.

It’s not

like a broadcast station where the man who enters into
operating the broadcast station must operate in the public
interest„
The analogy, as I say, if you're going to be a CATV
system, you’re going to be a CATV system, which means that
you’re going to carry the local signals? it means that you
are going to carry them in such a way as not to degrade them.

But you must meet certain technical standards in your
operation of a CATV function»
the business we're in.

We have no problem.

That's

The Commission can lay down rules

and regulations that if we enter the CATV business f we must
do- it in the appropriate manner, and that's what Soufchwastern
was all about.
Q

And in the public interest.

MR. PLQTKXNt

In the public interest related to the

reception and as ancillary to the broadcast function. I don't
see how it’s ancillary to the broadcast function to tell us
that we must become a broadcast station in effect in a way
that might yield benefits to the public.

It does not help

the broadcast station in any event to have us become a
competitor by originating programs.

The whole theory of

regulation even in the broadcast field—those of us who come
from small towns who don't have any broadcast station would
love to have had broadcast stations.

The Commission has

never had the power to say to someone that you've got to go
in and operate a broadcast station in that particular town.
They say if you want to operate a station in that town, you’ve
got to live tip to certain rules and regulations.

But the

affirmative requirement that tells him that he must operate
a broadcast station is really what’s involved here.

It’s

imposing a duty on a difference of kind, not just of degree,
not just definition.

They can tell us how to operate a CATV

42
business, the quintessence of a CATV system,

But when they

say beyond that you now must undertake to operate in addition
a broadcast station, the correlative of this would be in the
area before there was a multi "'Channel war, let us say, when
people were operating either VHF or UHF television stations
and the Commission said, "Television is not getting its
maximum potential for the simple reason that there aren’t
enough either cheap receivers out or there aren't enough
receivers outstanding that are capable of receiving UHF.
And, therefore, as a condition of operating your television
’

station, we insist that you go into the manufacturing business
and manufacture receivers so that people will be able to
receive their signals."
Hot only didn’t the Commission undertake to do that
with respect'to broadcasters, as I mentioned earlier, even
with respect to manufacturers who are manufacturing receivers;
it took a specific enactment of Congress to enable the
Commission to be able to tell the manufacturer

that in order

to engage in this business, your receiver must carry all channel
and not just the channels that you want to put on.
When the Commission adopted its rules and regula­
tions which said that you can't have the luxury of carrying
only distant signals, if you're going to be a CATV system,
you must carry local signals, that was enabling them to
regulate the business that we have done to perform, in a

43
reception function*■

If they say that the signal must have a

certain quality to make sure that the public gets the same
quality of signal on the set as being transmitted by the
station, that also .is part of it.

But. to say in addition

that we must become a broadcast station is in effect the
analogy that we cited in our brief, like the distributor
of -the New York Times in Washington, for example, is
performing a function, he is taking advantage of a newspaper
function.

If some local authority said that in return for

that privilege, we don’t think there are enough local
newspapers in town, we think that you ought to publish a
local newspaper, this is what the Commission is doing.
We are not arguing with the desirability of the
function.

What we’re saying is under our system of

regulation, that you cannot be compelled to dedicate your
property to a business that you don’t choose, that when you
enter a business you are subject to rules and regulations?
and if we voluntarily originate, so far as this case is
concerned, we can’t originate and fail to comply with the
same fairness, equal opportunity, and other law as does a
broadcast station.
Q

I thought the basic question here was whether

or not this order of the Commission was within its
statutory authority, not whether or not it was good or bad.
MR. PLOTKIN:

That's right.

It is.

And that's why

44
X say we are not arguing that the line should be a 3500 or
6000 or 10,000.

We are not arguing that.

But we're argui:

it's not within the statutory jurisdiction to compel us to
do this.
I do want to mention one further fact.

It's not

crucial to the case, but Mr. Justice Douglas had asked whether
there are any grandfather rights with respect to this.
grandfather rights are not applicable here.

The

This is

applicable to all CATV systems no matter whan they started.
The grandfather rights that the Commission recognized in
this field pertained to the situation that you're permitted
to continue to carry the broadcast signals that you did
before.

But no grandfather protection has been called into /

this thing.

We don't think that's crucial because we think

the statutory jurisdiction is lacking for the new system as
well as old systems.

But 1 didn't want the record to be

vague on that point.
In summary, the position that we have taken is that
it's ci matter of statutory authority the Commission is
authorized to regulate broadcast stations.

They are

authorised to regulate CATV systems only to the extent that
it's reasonably ancillary to broadcast functions.

And that

relates to the type of rules and regulations as to the
carriage of broadcast signals.

We do not argue, because it's

not involved, as to whether if we’re going to take voluntary

45
origination that we are not subject to the same rules and
regulations as are applicable to broadcast stations»
not before the Court.

That is

We are not contesting this so far as

this record is concerned.

We do say, though, that we should

not be compelled to enter into a brand net?, entirely
different kind of business as a condition of performing the
function of making signals available that are dedicated to
the public by taking their signals and putting them to the
use for which the dedication was contemplated.
