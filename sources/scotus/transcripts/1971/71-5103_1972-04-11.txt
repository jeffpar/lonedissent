the Courts
1 am counsel
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Before you proceed, counsel,
let rsie mention one ether factor, that Mr. Justice Marshall is
unavoidably absent this morning, but he will participate in
the cases to be heard today on the basis of the files, records,
briefs, and the recording of the oral argument,
MR. BRITTIK: Thank you, Your Honor,
I was appointed by this Court to represent the
petitioners in this case, which are habeas corpus cases.

I was

likewise appointed by the United States Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit to represent petitioners in the cases below.
The opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit, which is under review in this case, affirmed
the orders of Judge Stephenson, at that time United States
District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa, denying both
petitions involved in these cases.
Petitioners had both been prisoners in the Iowa State

4
Penitentiary ant had both received paroles from the Iowa
Board of Parole.
Subsequently, each of those respective paroles were
revoked by the Iowa Board of Parole, such revocations having
been accomplished without either of the petitioners having
been afforded any type of evidentiary hearing to establish
the fact of parole violation.
Both petitioners allege in their petition for habeas
corpus, filed in the District Court, that their constitutional
rights to due process of law had been violated by the action
of the Iowa Board of Parole in revoking their paroles without
a hearing, and that such State action constituted a deprivation
of liberty without due process of law.
Judge Stephenson, in separate orders, denied the
respective petitions, holding that the applicable Iowa
statutory law did not require such a hearing, and that the
procedures followed by the Iowa Board of Parole have been
held sufficient fox* Federal constitutional purposes.
After granting the certificates of probable cause,
the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
head the cases en banc and, by a vote of 4 to 3, affirmed the
orders of Judge Stephenson.
This, Court granted certiorari on December of last
year.
The question then presented to review in this case

is whether or not the action of the Iowa'Beard of Parole, in
revoking petitioners* respective paroles, without providing
either of said petitioners a prior evidentiary hearing to
establish the fact of parole violation, denied petitioners
liberty without due process of law, in violation of the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the tonstitution
of the United States.
At this point I believe a brief factual review of the
circumstances is appropriate*
With respect to Petitioner Morrissey first:

he

entered a plea of guilty to a County Attorney’s Information
charging him with false uttering of a check and was sentenced
by an Iowa State District Court to the Iowa State Penitentiary
for a term of seven years.
After serving approximately one and a half years
of his sentence, Morrissey was granted a parole by the Iowa
Board of Parole.

After being on parole approximately seven

months, he was arrested for a parole violation, confined in the
County Jail, and shortly thereafter his parole agent filed a
written report of violation with the Iowa Board of Parole,
recommending that his parols be revoked.
Three days later an order was entered by the Iowa
Board of Parole revoking his parole and ordering that he be
returned to the penitentiary.
This order was entered by the Iowa Board of Parole

6
solely on tbs basis of the parole officer9s written report
without granting the petitioner a hearing of any kind to
determine the fact of parole violation*
Q

Mr. Brittin, as 1 understand the record, the

parole officer had talked to Morrissey, had ha not?
MR. BRITTXN*

1 believe you're correct, Your Honor,

but he had talked to Morrissey in jail at the time lie had been
arrested# after the parole agent got the warrant for his arrest
for parole violation.

Q

hs X understand, it is respondent’s contention

that Morrissey pretty well admitted the charges against him.
MR. BRItfTJSIs

You are correct in stating that it is

respondent’s contention» if I understand his contention
accurately, and 1 don’t wish to speak for him# but 1 do believe
that he contended that Morrissey admitted at that time that
he violated the conditions of his parole.
However, it is our position that he did not
unequivocally admit the alleged violations.

He admitted

certain acts which may have constituted violations, if there
were no explanation for them.

He did offer explanation for

certain of his acts, which, I believe, were in mitigation and
may tend to establish that he did not in fact violate his
parole»

Q

How about the automobile?

MR. BRZTl’IHs Sxcuse rae f Your Honor?

The auto*»

hi obi Is ?

Yes, tbs automobile.

MR. BRZTTXN:

Be admitted that he had purchased an

automobile under an assumed name.
1 might point out that —•
Q

Is that in violation of —

MR, BRITTIN:

I don't think that the parole

agreement specifically required

prohibited him from doing

that, but I think that that act was probably in violation of
his parole agreement.
Q

Well, he admitted that one act, anyway?

MR. BRITTXHs
Honor.

He admitted the act, that’s right, Your

He did not admit that he had violated his parole, but

he did *— you are correct in saying that he did admit an act
which would —
Q

Well, there’s no dispute about the facts on that

pa rti cm Iar thing?
MR. BRITTIN: About the automobile?

1 think you’re

correct, Your Honor.
Q

And it's just a question of whether or not that

should amount to a violation of a parole agreement?
MR, BRITTINs That's right, and whether or not. that
Q

That even if it was a violation, what parole

should bs revoked?
MR. BRITTINs That's right

Ana I night point out at this time that both with
respect to Petitioners Morrissey and Booher, and this situation
was similar with Booher, he was sentenced and served two and a
half years, was paroled, was out about nine months, and then he
was arrested for a parole violation»
written report*.

The parole agent filed a

The Board of Parole revoked his parole on the

basis of that written report»
The violations with respect to Booher were quite
similar to the ones in Morrissey.

He was alleged to have been

driving nr. automobile without permission of his parole
officer and while his license was under suspension.

He was

accused of leaving the territorial limits of 0'Brian County,
Iowa, without the parole Officer's permission, and he was
accused of not being able to keep a job.
These things — and I think that he admitted
operating the motor vehicle.

Apparently it was his wife's

gait operating the motor vehicle
without the permission of his parole officer.
I might point out that these violations, what we’re
talking about are what may be called technical violations.
They are filed acts which constitute —• the charged acts, if
proven, would constitute technical violations of the parole
agreement.

It is not alleged —
Q

You mean an automobile purchase is in that

category, Mr. Brittin?

9
MR. BRITTINs

I don't believe the purchase of an

automobile -Q

Under a false name?

MR. BRITTXN:

I don’t believe that that would be —

that that would necessarily constitute a crime, Your Honor.
It’s certainly deception -Q

It would constitute —• I thought you had

indicated to Justice White that that would be a basis for
revoking parole?
MR. BRITTXN:

Yes? 1 think I indicated to him that?

if proven, that fact would constitute an act which might form
the basis of a revocation of parole.

However? it’s a technical

violation ~Q

If it’s admitted? why do you need proof?

Is

it ~~ would you say that it would be unreasonable to analogize
that to a plea of guilty to a charge?
MR, BRITTIN:

1 think there’s a great difference,

Your Honor, because the only evidence in this record? and 1
think the only evidence that there is at all? whether inside
or outside the record, is with respect to what — the statement
that the parolee made to his parole agent while he was in
custody? and I don’t believe that the Board of Parole or
uu;j.v else should rely solely upon those statements when
submitted to the Board of Parole in written form? as a basis
for a parole revocation

10
1 believe that a parolee should ba given a chance to
bell the Board of Parole, to adsit or deny to the Board of
barrit, whether or not he's violated hie parole? and I think
he should hate an opportunity to appear before the Board and
. .

-an are making the

allegations against him, be it the parole officer or other
persons»
What wa're talking about is a situation in which a
parole, which is & *— v;@ don't want to call it a right or a
privilege, 1 don't think it's correct tc call it either.

It's

a status enjoyed by the parolee, and we're talking about a
revocation of that based upon a written statement by a parole
agent.
I think that the Constitution —
*

Q

And that statement, at least with respect to

Morrissey, appears at page 55 of the Appendix, does it not?
MR. BRXTTIN:
0

I think that's correct. Your Honor.

Is there a copy of the parole agreement in

here?
MR. BRITT It?: There is, it's at page 100, Your Honor,
of the Appendix.
Q

Page 100.

And is it a standard parole agree­

ment that both of these petitioners signed?
MR. BRITTIHj

In fact, the one at page 100 is a form

of parole agreement that was submitted to the District Court.

It was not ever established, and 1' do not know if this is
signed by either one of the petitioner

herein is that.
ease.

Those forms have never been produced in this

But this is, it is ray understanding, the standard form

of parole agreement which is used in the State of Iowa»
0

And this is, presumably, what each one of these

petitioners —•
MR* BRXTTIN:
Q

Presumably, Your Honor.

— signed. And then 1 suppose with respect to

individual parolees, other conditions may be added;?

or am I

wrong about that?
MR. BRSTTIW?

You may be correct. Your Honor,

except that I do not know that additional conditions were
added in either of these cases.
Q

Do you think that the parole officer's,

conversation with these parolees at least established probable
cause to believe that a violation had occurred?
MR. BRITTXN:

I think that they may well have

established probable cause to believe —
Q

That is, you don't object to the fact that,

having found out what he found out, the parole officer could
arrest them?

And defend

MR. BRITTXNs

them?
Ho, I don't object to that. Your

Honor«

Q

So that arrest and detention pending a hearing

would be satisfactory, as far as you8 re concerned?
MR. BRITTXNj So far as I'm concerned in this case,
Your Honor, that would be satisfactory.

What I ‘ia talking

about in this ease is the revocation of parole and sending a
paroles back to serve the remainder of his sentence, which
could be five or six years.
Q

Well, I'm not saying this is this kind of a

case, but let's just assume that there was no need because of
the admission of a series of events and acts, you call them
technical violations if you want to? let’s assume that there
is no need for an evidentiary hearing as to what the facts
were, and it's just a question of a judgment as to whether
parole should be revoked.
MR. BRXTTIN: Assuming that facts have been estab­
lished, and I would maintain that those facts should be
established by —
Q

Right.

MR. BRITAIN:

•*- a hearing. But assuming that they

have been established -~
Q

Well, you wouldn't have — X suppose if you got

a man, a probationer, for example, before a court, into the
court, and the judge says, “Did you do these things?"
/
said yes.

And he

Would you —
MR, BRXTTIN:

No, I wouldn't object to that, and I

wouldn’t, I don’t think, object to it if the parole board

13

would call the parolee in and give him a hearing.

What you9re

talking about, when you * rs talking about a probationer being
before the court is what I'm talking about;

a parolee being

before the Parole Board and having a chance to admit or deny
the allegations, to present evidence on his own behalf.
Q

But this would be after he had been arrested

and
MR. BRITTIN:
Q

After he had been arrested,

— been incarcerated.

MR. BRITTIN;

— and incarcerated, and if that time

was a reasonable time, that is not "what I’m talking about in
this case.
Q

So if the Parole Board — if he’s returned to

jail and then the Parole Board calls him before them and he
has an opportunity to say yes or no, to say whatever he wants
to j that1s enough?
MR. BRITTIN;

If he has an opportunity to admit or

deny the allegation, to confront and cross-examine the
witnesses who may offer evidence against him ~
Q

That is if he denies it.

MR. BRITTIN:

If he denies them.

If, Your Honor,

he admits the violation to the Parole Board, under circumstances
from which it is clear that he does so voluntarily and knowing
the consequences of his admission, then

1

have no objection to

a parole revocation in that circumstance, without further

14
proceeding.

Q

Mr. Britt.in, did the Parole Beard here, after

your client had been raturr.ed to prison , interview him with

respect to the alleged parole violation?
MR. BRITTXSSs

I think that they did Interview him,

and that word is very critical, Your Honor.

1 think the

word is Minterview” ? they did not give him a hearing.
Q

They —-

Well, how would you distinguish between what

was done and what you think ought to have been done in the
way of a hearing?

MR,, BRXTTIKs

Very frankly, Your Honor, 1 was not

aware until the respondents filed their brief herein that
there was any such interview at all, and I know nothing more
about that hearing —
Q

Nor were we.

MR. BEXTTINs

— than is in the respondents* brief.

So 1 don’t know vh&t happened at that hearing.

1 do know that

there is a thing called a post-revocation interview.
don’t know what happens there.

But 1

1 don's* know who is there. I

don’t know whether — of course, this occurs at a time after
the parolee is already back in prison, and I don’t think that

a hearing at that time satisfies the requirements of due
process.
Q

Well, how long after the arrest on parole

violation was this inf: a r v i e w p ro c © s s he 1 a ?

IS

M ■ BRITAIN t

From respondents' brief —

1 correct that it was about 29 or 30 days'?

o.

MR. BKi'Vx'ls-T; From respondents5 brief r I knew

it was not mere than two months after the revocation.

Now,

the arrest for violation was in another approximately week to
two weeks# depending on whether we * re talking about Morrissey
or Booher# prior to the revocation.
I think, Your Honor,

that any hearing, the kind of

hearing I'm talking about is a hearing prior to the order of
revocation.

Once the order of revocation, ones the parole is

revoked, the prisoner is back in prison# and I don't: think
a hearing at that time is sufficient for constitutional
purposes.
Q

Well# where do you think he should be between

the time he is arrested for the parole violation and the
tine of the hearing?

Would it be inappropriate for him to be

back in prison?

m.„ BRITT2N:

I think if he has a — there is

evidence that his presence in society as any other parson than
as a parolee would b© dangerous to society# that he should

I do not object to his incarceration ~~
Q

Wall# you said ha could be arrested because

of the probable; caune to believe that he violated his parole.
How# after —• you mean that constitutionally he can 'be

arrested but than h.

must foe released again?

IS
MR. BRXTTIN:

Ho, the point I was trying to make,

'x.j-ry Honor, is, that if this pero is a dangerous person, i
think that he should foe incarcerated,. pending the —

if

there's probable cause to believe that he is —
Q

Unless there is some finding that he's

dangerous, he must be — he has to be released after bail,
is that it?
MR. BRITTXHs

Ho, X really don't think that's

important to the case, Your Honor.
Q

Well, -would you rather have him in the city

jail than in some jail as to where the —
MR. BRITTXN; Well, I think that the hearing should
be held within a short time.

I'm talking about a week or so.

And in Iowa, only because the penitentiary is way off down
in one corner of the State, I think transporting a prisoner
back and forth may not be necessary, and holding him in the
county jail for a period of a week or so, particularly so he
can talk to counsel if he has some, so he can make prepara­
tions for the hearing would be appropriate to the case.

And

X don't think that it would be necessary to return him to
prison.
Q

You're not contending here that he’s entitled

to counsel at this hearing, are you?
MR. BRITTXH s

X think that once it is determined

that a petitioner is entitled to a hearing, prior to revocation

of his parole-, and considering the substantial interest, he
has in his continued liberty„ that there is authority for
this Court to hold that he is enli tied to counsel at such a
hearing.
Q

Wall, are you pointing to anything at this

proceeding that ha was entitled to counsel as well as to a
hearing?
MR. BRITTINs The issues in this case are, by the
record, limited to the right to a hearing and do not
include the question of a. right to counsel.

However, I do

believe that if this Court feels that the Constitution does
require a hearing prior to revocation of parole, that due to
the serious nature of the consequences to a parolee should
his parole be revoked without a hearing, and not in compliance
with the Constitution, that there is sufficient authority for
this Court to also hold that he snould be entitled to appoxivtea
counsel, should he not — that he should be entitled at least
to have retained counsel present.
That's — that, however, goes to the kind of hearing
that's required? and 1 think it's first most important for
fcho Court to determine whether or not a hearing is required.
And of course it’s our contention that it is.
In contending that a hearing is required, we-rely
principally upon that line of cases of this Court which have
held Plus process of law requires a hearing and an opportunity

18
to he: heard whenever important rights are substantially
affected by State action,

ted theeo cares I’m talking about

are cases like Goldberg, vs. Kelly, Bell vs» Burson, Groppi vs.
Leslie, and Greene vs» McSlroy.

These cases all held that a

hearing and an opportunity to foe heard are required prior to
•the termination by Stats action of various types of rights or
privileges enjoyed by these individuals.
And the types of rights that were involved in those
cases ares

not being disqualified for unemployment compensa­

tion? an individual’s interest in continued welfare benefits?
an individual’s interest in not having his name arbitrarily
posted on a public list of excessive drinkers? an individual's
interest in not being held in contempt of the State Legis­
lature? and an individual's interest in, an uninsured motorist’s
interest in not having his driver's license suspended after
an accident,
Mr. Brittin, would you contend that a hearing
is also required when the Parole Board sits to make a
determination as to whether parole should bs granted or not?
MR. BEITTIN:
Q

Ho, I would not, Your Honor.

Isn't that an equally important page in the

criminal proceeding, or doesn’t that equally affect the
substantial rights of the defendant?
MR* BKXTTXN:

It does ertend — you're correct that

it does affect his interests.

However, I think that what is

19

most

in that situation is that the Board of Parole

in sitting or determining whether or not to release a person on
parols is guided only by considerations in its expertise, in
examining the: conduct of the prisoner, to determine whether or
not they feel that he is a good risk for parole and should be
permitted to go outside of the walls of the prison and attempt
to continue his rehabilitationwhich they believe is, to
some extent at that point, on the outside of the prison.
After —
Q

Well, his conduct consists of factual matters,

and X .suppose it8 s conceivable the Board might be misinformed.
Shouldn’t he be entitled to cross-examine at least factual
witnesses at that stage on his conduct?
MR. BRITAIN;

If you’re right.

1 suppose an argument can be made

that if the Board of Parole denies a parole, when considering
whether or not to give a parole, denies it on the basis cf
allegations of fact concerning his conduct,an argument could
be made that he should ha entitled to appear before the Board.
As a matter of fact, as a matter of practice, most
— as I understand

most prisoners, at the time they’re

being considered for parole, do appear before a Board,.
2 think an argument could be made that he should be
entitled to some hearing at that time? but I’m not making that
argument, and 1 don’t, think it’s critical to this case,
because what we’re talking about is a parole®, a person whom

20
the Board of Parole has decided is worthy of this conditional
liberty or parole erd being permitted to go back out in
society and attempt to make a frill community and family life,
to contribute to society.

I'm talking about revocation Of

that status, which has previously been granted by the Board
of Parole»
And I think there’s a valid distinction there.
Q

Is the parole officer's report, on which the

revocation was based# at page 65 in the record?

Is that the

report?
MR. BRITTINs

That is the report with respect to

Petitioner Morrissey, and the report with respect to
Petitioner Booher is at page 106, I believe,
Q

Okay.

Thank you.

Q

When he had the interview that you've described

at the institution, does this record show that he then
admitted that he had bought the car under a false name?
MR. BRITTIN;

No, this record doesn't even show

that there was such a hearing, Your Honor.
0

All we know about that comes from your brother's

brief on the other side? there's nothing in the record about
any such?
MR. BRITTINs

Nothing in the record of the District

Court, the Court, of Appeals, or in this case concerning that
a11®ged hearing»

21
Q

Assuming now that at that interview, the facts

stated at the top of page 68, that he admitted that he bought
the 1960 Chevrolet, and so forth, and -registered it in a
false naias, and having in mind that one of the conditions of
his parole was that ho would.neither own nor operate an
automobile, and other vehicles, without the consent of the
Chief Parole Officer, would you think that would be grounds
for making the decision without hearing any further from him
after his admission?
MR. BRXTTXN: Well, 1 think that the Board of Parols
should, after his admission that he in fact purchased an
automobile under an assumed name, I think the Court should
hear from him his explanation, whatever reasons there may be
in mitigation.
Row, 1 can't think of what they would be at this
point for why a person would do that, except maybe to avoid
violating of a specific term of the parole agreementj but I
do think that that conduct constitutes a violation of the
spirit of it, if not the technical terms of it.
Q

Mr. Brittin, in your brief, you point out that

a parole hearing has a twofold function;

first *i to ascertain

whether or not there was a violation; the second, to determine
what * s to foe. done.
As 1 read your brief, you take the position that the
hearing rolatua to the first aspect of that only.

22

MR* BRITAINi

X think that that — that the hearing

relates to that part, most importantly? I would not concede
that prcssvca ox. tho- porolce at the time the Board may ha
soaking that second decision may not he of assistance to the
Board,.

But I think that for the purposes of this case a right

to hearing on the determination of the fact of violation is
whafc we•re talking about in this case.
Q

ted hearing could be terminated at that point»

under your submission here today?
MR. 8RITTIN:

I believe that’s correct, that the

hearing could be terminated once the Board of Parole has heard
from the parolee? he’s either admitted or denied the violation.
If he's admitted it, then he may have offered some extenuating
circumstances or other facts in mitigation.

At that point 1

believe it would be proper for the Board of Parole to adjourn
the hearing? to considor and deliberate in private with
respect to what action should b© taken once the facts have
been established.
Q

There is an overlap? as you suggest? however?

isn’t there? because you can show that the — well? for ©xamp.1©?
on© of the conditions of the parole agreement was that the
petitioner is not to leave the county.
MR, BRITVZKs That’s right.
0

&nd if you can show in a factual hearing? yes?

he did leave the county, but you could further show that he

23
i®ft because Ills mother war. dying and he tried to reach his
parole officer and it was a weekend and he couldn t reach his
parole officer, so in that emergency he left? and he returned
promptly.
MR. BRXTTXN:
Q

I believe that's —

That would show a violation of the parole, but

it would also show mitigating circumstances that would
presumably affect the Parole Board * s decision upon whether or
not to revoke the parole» would it not?
MB. BRITTIN: That is correct, Your Honor. And in
fact, in this case, the purported violation with respect to
Petitioner Bcoher shows that his parole agent was out of the
State for — on vacation during the period of time the al leered
violations occurred.
anyway.

So he did not know about them firsthand

That he was accused of leaving the county, to which

he was assigned, and that the violation sheivs that there are
two possible reasons for leaving the county.
One was, his wife went to Iowa City, Iowa, in
another county, to have a baby.

The other reason was that he

was having trouble keeping himself employed, and he left
the county fcc work.
Now, one of the conditions of parole is that he keep
himself employed? and another one is that he not leave the
county.

:ais parole agent was out of the State, and he left

the county to work.

24

at a hearing.

that circumstances like this can be shown
The parole agent, I5m not saying here, Your

Honor, that parole agents are dirty guys and we shouldn't be­
lieve them? but I'm saying that there are circumstances that
exist that where bias or prejudice or even honest misinforma­

He investigatas it to scrae extent.

He confronts the parolee

with it, as he did in this case, and gats whatever he has to

He writes up his report, submits it along with

his recommendation to the Beard of Parole, and on the basis
of this they revoke the parole or do not revoke the parole.

MR. SSUPERES.:

You're right, Your Honor,

The

attorney member, Mr, Beddel, of the Board of Parole, is the'
one I conducted extensive conversations with concerning this
matter once it came to ray attention, and he indicated that
only three times since he's been on the Board has any one
denied the alleged violation.
Q

X gather that must mean that not more than

three, if that many, have ever been released again on
parole?
MR, SEUPESERs That's right.

One of those three

was in fact released after further investigation. The other
two, they affirmed the action of revocation.

‘

ME. 82UPEKER? According to his comments to me.
Q

Now, all of this you’ve learned — what —

since certiorari was"granted in this case?
MR. SEUPERERs

In fact * Your Honor, since the

Appendix was prepared in this case.
Q

I came in —-

And from your conversations with Mr. Beddel?

MR. SEUFERERs

Yes.

I came into this case only

at the time certiorari was granted; was not familiar with it.
And looking through the Appendix, when 1 came across this
aspect about Mr. Morrissey, that triggered my talking to these
individuals, and that's where this information came to light.
I think it's unfortunate an evidentiary hearing was
not held at the District Court level, because that would have
undoubtedly brought these matters out,,
It is our contention, however,

that the question,

the posture of the question in this case is that a hearing
was not granted prior to revocation; and, in any ovent, the
hearing that was granted was most certainly after the initial
act of revocation.
There is a reason, a reason that was not unfavorable
to the parolee, as a matter of fact, as to why the initial
revocation tahes place at the time it does.

A section of the

Iowa Code, 247.12 , which is set out early in petitioners'

brief, indicates that a parolee is not credited with time

33
oervad while he's on parole

this is against his original

sentence — or while he’s away from the institution, if the
parole is revoked.
What this means is that if an individual, the
petitioners in this case, for instance, sat in the county jail
o r the local jail until such time as the Parole Board could
make arrangements to get there with all the facilities that
would be necessary for some sort of hearing, none of that time
would count against their original sentence.
What the initial action of the Parole Board does is
it provides that as soon as revocation takes place, they are
returned to the institution, and any time they serve subse­
quent to that, but still prior to any hearing that may be held
at the institution, is credited against their original
sentence.
Q

Well, it really wouldn't make much difference

to your procedure if the formality of revocation didn’t take
place until he was returned to the institution?
MR. SEUFERER:

Under the way the procedure actually

operates, it probably wouldn’t Your Honor.

It makes a

difference only in terms of — well, let me back up a step.
Q

It would bo merely a question of & label,

instead of calling the action the Parole Board takes when it
now revokes e. revocation, it could serve as sort of a preliminar
hearing?

That would be true on

However, if the parole is not revoked, the

individual would not foe sent back to the institution, and —
Q

He has to be revoked- before he gets back there?

MR. SEUF3RER: Before he gets back to the institu­
tion.

So what this means is that if we do not revoke the

parole, initially, —
Q

He just, sits in a jail.

MR. SEUFERER:

— he sits in a jail and the hearing

that is subsequently conducted would have to be conducted a 1.1

cause a considerable burden on the-? Board of Parole -Q

Yes.

MR. SEUPERER:

is there’s one, the State Penitentiary at Madison is the on®

most serious offenders are sentenced, and that’s naturally

Q

As far as you know, they weren't known to

♦

MR. SEUFERERs

I don't think they ware, Your, Honorc

because they certainly, the counsel that handled this case
at the Court of Appeals level certainly never gave me any

whether it is or not.

MR. SEUFERSR: This is the Federal District Court,
and
Q

Yes.

MR. SEUFERSR:

— for the Southern District.

3?
Q

Yes, the court.:1'9 order of March 25,

Well,

never mind —
MR, S3UFERER:

ZE1I tell you what might be

indicated *»0

— never minci? that's all right.

MR. SSUFSRSR:

Okay.

The record that would indicate a hearing was held
in this case would be a record held by the Parole Board at
any rate, and its central office in Des Moines may not — may
well not be a part of the total prison records.
Additionally, we feel that the question in this
case being a prior hearing, that there are severe! reasons
why a hearing prior to revocation is not necessary and not
advantageous.
One of the things is the aspect<£ detriment to the
parolee, we do not feel is there.

Obviously, if he’s taken

away from a job, if he's deprived of living at home with his
family and so forth, these deprivations are going to be there
whether we have a prior hearing or not under the system as it
works, and in almost all the cases; because the parole
violations, even though they may only be-allegations at on®
point, in most cases are sufficient to Justify the issuing of
a warrant end picking him up and holding him in the county

jail.
So whether he really sits in the county jail or the

penitentiary seams relatively immaterial in terms of his
iivh-ar-ests and remaining on his conditional liberty.
Q

Well, isn’t there a great deal of difference,

including a psychological difference, let along perhaps a
burden-of-proof difference, as to whether or not the hearing
is held prior to the decision of the Parole Board to revoke
parole, as contrasted with a hearing after that fait accomplir
after the Board has decided to invoke parole, then there’s a
very great burden, is there not, on the parolee to convince
the Board to undo what it’s done? I’m thinking of cases like
?
Armstrong v. Manso, you may be familiar with, and there are
many others, that emphasize the importance of a prior hearing,
before the decision is made.
MR. SEUFERER:

Your Honor, I think if the situation

was one where the parolee steadfastly denied the allegations
alleged, that that psychological difference might come into
practice.
Q

How about burden of proof?

I suppose there's

no formal principles that have been worked out in parole
revocation ae to burden of proof, has there?
MR. SEUFERER;

No, Your Honor, as a practical matter,

I guess it hasn't really proved necessary to, because there
are so few cases where anything changes.

There are- so few

cases where there's a denial of the offense.

And, in fact,

these two cases here, not only do the reports of violations —

which, admittedly, the comments in there are the continents of
the parole officer as taken from the individual parolee.*— but
in both of these instances, if they.

are carefully read, the

rules that he alleges were violated, the petitioners admit the
violation of those stales»

And I think the significant thing

about it is, nowhere in all of the proceedings of this case,
including at this level, have they ever denied commission of
those offenses, have they ever said, ”We didn’t do what they
said wa did."
Nowhere have
Q

Well, what about in the Booher case, though,

as counsel suggested, that in Booher's instance, he left the
county, all right, but he did it because his wife was having a
baby in some county, or because he bad a job offer?
MR. SEUFERER:
Q

Your Honor, I think that’s —

They may be violations, but might they not be

waived at a prior hearing, as not justifying, under those
circumstances, the revocation?
MR. SEUFEREPs

I think, Your Honor, that there’s a

point to be made in that respect.

However, I think that

there's a point that weighs against that, too.

In that you'll

notice, I think, in both of these cases, and in the majority
of cases- a parole is not revoked on the basis of one alleged
violation»
In other words, there are three in noth of these

40
instances, and usually, I think also, that the reported
violations indicates there are some p as i: problems.
ws

talking about here, the

parole
officers and
the Board of Parole, are interested in a.
e.
y
rehabilitative process„

It8 s an expensive proposition to

maintain a prisoner, and it's not as expensive to maintain a
parolee.

They’re interested in working with these people ,

and Q

And a violation means failure?

MR. SEUFERERs ■

A violation means — it's an

admission of failure, really, by the people that are trained
to help them.
And I think that the — 1 think there is something
to be said for the mitigating circumstances.

But I believe

this is a discretionary question that has to foe waived by
the Board along with this guy's entire past history, including
the psychiatry reports they have from the institution when
he was there, his performance there, everything else.

And

1 think in the sum total of things that this decision, the
second decision, if you will, as to whether or not the parole
should be revoked, once the fact of violation is established,
is such a discretionary matter and as such involves so many
non-legal, non-technical type considerations that it would serve
no useful purpose to have factual proof on some of these
things.

It had been brought to the attention of the Board o
Parole, at any rate.

In other words, they knew about it.

I think in the ease of fact for Petitioner

Morrissey, the parole officer submitted his report of violation
on, 1 believe, January 28,» '69? the parole was revoked, and
Morrissey was in fact in earcerated in the local jail on the
arrest warrant on the 31st of January, which would indicate
that, in that instance, —
Q

Well, tell me what the process is.

The report

is filed with whom?
MR. SEUFERER: With the Board of Parole and with the
— there arc actually about five copies of it, one goes, to
each, of the three members of the Board of Parole and the State
office.
Q

And then what's the procedure then which loads

to an order of revocation?
MR. SEUFERERs

The procedure then is that the Board

of Parols, on just *— really on the basis of the information
contained therein and on any past records of the individual,
vote individually, usually —Q

You mean by telephone or mail or --

MR. SEUFERERs

Normally it’s by mail.

They vote

by mail to the Chief Parole Officer, who is located in D&s

43
Moines, in the capital; and two votes out of the three
trigger the issuance of a revocation,
Q

And until that procedure has been completed,

the parolee is not picked up?
Q

Wo, he's in jail.

ME. SEUFERER: Well, he may be in jail.

Wo.

MR, SEUFERER:

Once the parole officer, parole

supervision ha3 information of alleged violationshe may
have a warrant issued for the man's arrest, holding him in the
local jail.
Q

And where does he get the warrant?

MR, SEUFERER: That comes through the local
authorities.

It's approved by the State parole officer, though.

In other words, it's —
Q

Well, then, I'm still puzzled.

MR. SEUFERER: This is correct.
Q

And who supervised him.

MR. SEUFERER:

Booher had a

MR. SEUFERER:
Q

That's correct, Your Honor*

Mow, then, how, what was the procedure which

led up to Booher's going to the county jail?
MR. SEUFERER:

The parole officer, with — usually

s a matter of informing the Chief Parole Officer in Des
Moines, who supervisea the whole operation, of the information
available to him, and that he wished a warrant issued to pick
up Petitioner Booher because he was in the process of filing
a report of violation on him.
Q

Now, the warrant, is it an administrative

warrant?
MR. SEUFERERi

It's an administrative -- well, no

Your Honor, it's not; it's a warrant issued by the local
authorities, but -Q

Thank you.

Let hs take you to the setting in which the

p a r o le o £ f ic e r has received some information/that violations
have occurred, hut before he has completed his investigation
and made his report to the State Parole Board,

Now, in that

setting, does lie contact the prisoner as a matter of practice,
the parolee, ami confront him with the suggestion of violation
and give him an opportunity to explain them or answer —
MR# SEUFERERs As was done in these cases, yes,
Q

Yes.

Isn't that always done?

MR. SEUFERER:

Your Honor, I hesitate to say always?

but the normal practice is that that's what they do»'

Unless

the parolee is — that they're unable to pick him up, because
in some cases he of course is gone from the State, and in that
case he does not.
Q

But the Parole Board is about to revoke the

parole without a report from the parole officer as to what
he5 s found out?
MR. SEUFERERs

No, they do not.

As a matter — they

just do not do that,
Q

It may say "'he's gone; I can't find him’5? that’s

all he knows.
MR. SEUFERERs Well, it depends on —
Q

At least that's what the parole officer says

to the Parole Board

46
MR. SEuFERER:

Yes.

Well, if that's without some

verification that he in fact is gone, I really don't know what
the Parole Board would do.

It's 'unlikely they would revoke

in that case,.
Q

But as a practical matter, what has the Parole

Board to act on except the report of the parole officer?
MR. SHOPEHER:

In essence, that’s what they have.

Aside frcmtyha tever past records they have of him.

They of

course have files on all of these people.
Q

Yes.

But, ordinarily, if there is a recommenda­

tion by the parole officer that his parole be revoked, I take
it that1s what the Parole Board does, does it not?
MR. SEUFERER: That's not correct, Your Honor.

As

a matter of — again we're talking about things on which I
don't have the exact statistics on it, but in ray discussions
with Mr. Bedclel, it was his indication that they reject a lot
of these, in other words turn the man loose, depending upon
their judgment in terms of whether he's still a cood risk to
remain on parole.
Xn this kind of situation, where you have three
alleged violations, all admitted. I would say almost always
they're going to buy that recommendation.

If you have one

allegation, it was Mr. Beddel's opinion that normally if it
is strictly u technical one, in other words he left the county
or something, --

47
q

Like the one you had with Booher, where he was

going to pick up a job in another county?
MR. 83UFERBRs

Yes.

Now, that's the type of thing,

if that was the only violation, the probabilities are they
would not
q

vhe probabilities are there wouldn't be a

recommendation? he's already gone.
MR. SEUPERERs That's right, the probabilities are
there wouldn't be.
q

We're now, however, talking about a situation

where there is a recommendation by the parole officer.
MR. SEUFERER: Well, it's my understanding that in
many of these: cases, in many cases — you know, “many" is,
S realise — I can't pin this down statistically? I'm sure
we could more closely from members of the Board of Parol®.
But in many cases they don't accept the‘recommendation, to
answer your specific question.
I could only speculate as to what cases —
3

This is from what Mr. Beddel told you?

MR. SEUFERER:

Yes, that's what he told me,

That

was verified by the Chief Parole Officer, who is right next
door to me, and I’m able to talk to, at any rate, on a daily
basio? but it's my understanding they do not accept the
recommendation in. every case.
Q

I glanced through the appendix to one of the

48
amicus briefs here, that indicates about 30 out of the 50 States
has some font, of hearing

Is that — have 'I counted that

correctly?
MR, SEUFERER:

I think there might even be more than

that, Your Honor» that have some sort of hearing.

Not

necessarily provided by statute or by ease decisions in the
State, but by a practice, as is the situation in Iowa.
Q

Nor necessarily before revocation?

MR. SEUFERER: That8s correct, Your Honor.
Nor necessarily before revocation.
Q

Well, do you know how many have them before

revocation?
MR, SEUFERER:

I do not have that figure available.

Your Honor.
In respect to what you've mentioned, the statistics
you’ve mentioned there, there is a publication that will,
I understand, be published this summer by the National Council
on Crime and Delinquency, which is called the Organization
of Parole Systems, and is prepared by the National Parol®
Institute, and they studied or —- not studied, but set out
the procedures of parole operation, both granting and
revocation in all the States, or attempted to in all 50 States.
There is a section in there on the State of Iowa,
which indicates ~~ I looked at some of these, the draft of
some of these, and they’re not terribly specific, but it doss

49
indicate that there is a revocation hearing subsequent to the
parole revocation — that there is a hearing subsequent to
revocation, 1 should say,
R

In your State?

MR. SEUP3&SR:

In our State, yes.

That is that the

Iowa section will cover —
Q

Bearing out what you've learned and have

briefed?
MR. SSUFERER:

Yes, bearing out the general procedure»

Not that these two specific individual is specifically had one.
Q
Appendix now.

Mr. Seuferer, I'm looking at page 6? of the
At the bottom of the page, under Roman numeral

XIIf "Parolee's Version of the Offenses”, and that is followed
by a summary of the effort on the part of the parole officer
to get a response.
MR. SEUFE3RER: That's correct, sir.
Q

And that's followed in turn by a recital of the

previous violations and his parole history.

Is this report,

if you know, typical of the types of reports which the parole
agents make to the Board in connection with a proposed
revocation?
MR. SEUFERER:

I think it's substantially typical

in tersis of what thay've covered.
terms of form.

It's not necessarily in

And in a lot of cases they may not know of

sora-a of the previous violations, and that sort of information.

But in ter ms of retting out the rules violated#
setting out some son c of stxmvn&ry of how they ware violated,

s e tt ing o ;;c s osvk3th i n g about the paroles's version of these
offenses# and a cone Ins;.an or recoiftmsiKiation,* that- I think,
is substantially wha t the bulk of them cover,

As far as this information about previous violation
and parole history# if they know it# if they're aware of it#
has been his parole officer all the time , they generally
will include something about that.,

If they don't# which

they nay not# they don't have to.
Q

&nd you've said in response to some questions

from the bench that before the warrant, the violation — the
parole violation warrant is served and the arrest made there
is some local magistrate or officer, a neutral officer who
issues that warrant.

Just who is that?

ME. SSUFERER?
Q

Your Honor, that's —

A municipal judge, or what kind of person?

MR. SSUFERERs
who issues that warrant.

Your Honor, I’m not really sure
It’s a —> it may be — I'm sure it8

not, in most instances, a judge.
Q

Some sort of —

It’s a person in the locality where the agent

and the violation —
MR,. SEUFE'ftEE:

X think that is usually the

hitu.afcion t but it' s on the basis of ~~ 1 think I should make

this clear.

it43 on the basis of the approval, really, by the

State, Chief Parole Officer in Des Moines'.

In other words,

the local - judge ox“ the local magistrate is not, 59 times out
of 100, going to refuse to issue a warrant•
Q

This is just, say, for all practical --

MR. SSUFERERs
Q

It's a procedure thing.

~~ for all intents and purposes it's a case

of a parole-police officer determining that the facts are such
that thereeo probable cause for arrest, and arresting?
MR. SEUFERER:

In essence, that’s correct, Your

Honor.
Q

And X suppose that down under 247.9 of your

Code, which makes a parolee subject at any time to be taker,
into custody.
MR. SEUFERER: That's correct. Your Honor.

Q

Would it administratively be feasible if the

process that's covered in this report of the parole officer
be presented to that, local magistrate or whatever other officer
may be involved on the warrant, and have him at least make a
preliminary determination and give the parolee ar opportunity
to answer to the specific charges before the revocation —
before the arrest was made?
MR. SEUFERERs

If your question is, would that be

administratively possible —
Q

Yes.

MR. SEUFERERs

~ I think it probably would. Your

52
Honor.

As to where —
Q

?
Remember in Kiser v. Reed , that was what was

ordered with respect to the federal system.
MR. SEUFERER:
Q

That6s correct.

That within a reasonable time after the

determination., of a probable violation, the parolee must foe
given an opportunity to be heard to show why he should not be
arrested and returned to the federal institution.
MR. SEUFERER: That's correct, Your Honor.

And the

only problem that comes to mind on that kind of process is
the local magistrate, if you will, is going to be considering
certainly only the facts that he has before him.

This is —

while thin would seem —> in the case where there is no questio
where the individual had admitted the violations, this would
seem unnecessary, unless there's some question of voluntari­
ness of that admission.
And at least so far as the cases of the Petitioners,
there ha3 never been any allegation that they were in any
way coerced in anything they did.
Administratively possible?

I think yes. Your Honor,

it would be.
We would then, in summary, — our contention is that
the Petitioners, Morrissey and Boeher, both admitted the
fact of parole violation? have never in any manner denied that
admission.

And in light of these facts, we would submit that

regardless of what may foe nice or better, maybe, in a general
proposition, the two petitioners here got all the process they
were due, ancl we respectfully request that this Court affirm
the lower court decision.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Seuferer.

Yota: time is up, Mr. Brittin, but I want to express
the Court’s appreciation for your accepting the appointment
in this case, and for your assistance to your clients and to
the Court.
MR. BRZTTIN:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
