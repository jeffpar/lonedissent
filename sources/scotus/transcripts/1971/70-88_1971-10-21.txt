ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY CRBYKE, JR. r ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CREYKEs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleases the

Courts
This case involves a 1361 federal construction
contract; in which additional work and extra work doubled the
original anticipated effort.

There was an administrativa

appeal pursued through the Atomic Energy Commission under the
disputes process, as it's popularly called, which was.won by
the contractor and accepted by th© Atomic Energy Commission.
However, on its own initiative, the General Accounting
Office blocked payment of this, forcing the contractor into the
Court of Claims.

And it’s from thence that the case is here.

In this Court the Department of Justice contends
that the intervention in this proceeding on the part of the
Court of Claims is not material.

We say it is the gravamen of

the entire situation, and only by a review of all of these
circumstances, and a consideration of the impact of this, as
well as all of these circumstances, can the Court properly
determine a solution to the problem which has been created by
this

4
Th© case, involve® the rights of contractors, it
involves the finality of the agency decision, it involves an
interpretation of the so-called Wunderlich Act of 1954, and we
ask that the Court hold that the findings by the Atomic Energy
Commission, accepted by it and not appealed by it as such, be
determined to bs the final action of the government and binding
on the parties in this case.
Reviewing the history, this was originally a contract
for $1,272,000 to consume 130 days, starting August of '61.
They wore to build a large concrete test basin at the Atomic
Naval Reactor Test Station in Idaho.

The contract was not

security classified, it was a standard Form 23-23A type of
contract with the usual boiler-plat© clauses, for equitable
adjustments, for changes, suspension of work, change of
conditions, and time extensions, and & regular standard
disputes clausa.
There were six change orders which were agreed upon,
c.nd increased the contract price by a little over $100,000.
However, the bulk of the claims for additional work
v/ere denied by the contracting officer.

The work was completed

and accepted 325 days after the original time, which of course
throw it into winter work, in the mountains of Idaho in winter.
The claims for additional compensation under the
then prevailing practice and rules of the Atomic Energy
Commission were referred to a hearing examiner, who, in December

of *62 conducted a 13-day full adversary hearing.

At th®
However, this

The costa of this

/era wore' bom© by fch© contractor, and they still remain unpaid
Tli© merits of the claims, a® such, are not in issue.
»

Rather, it is th® treatment of the disposition of thorn that is
in issue.
Generally speaking, they are very ordinary type of
claimss

delay in site access? additional concrat© work?

failure of the government to furnish steam? excusable delay for
unusually sever© weather; order to accelerate, to work around
■th© clock, alleging behind schedule when in fact the time
extensions would have put the contractor on schedule? and a
backfill claim.
Following the decision by the examiner for S&E
Contractors, ther© wes an appeal by the contracting officer
to the Commission itself, and there were two decisions of th©
Commission itself. In «essence affirming the decision of th©
examiner, making only on® minor modification.

That had to do

with the number of days in site access and the start.

In

other words, administratively, there was not only a determina­
tion by th® contracting officer and by th® examiner, but action
by th© full Commission itself.
This is at variance with the general practice today
throughout the government whore these cases are heard by

contract appeal boards? and there is only one administrative
determination.

But the case was treated in the Court of Claims

as being analogous to these types of casas.
While the negotiations were in progress with respect
to fch® amount of the settlement? as a result of these
determinations» a certifying officer asked the General Accounting
Office lor a ruling on $32,000 worth of items which were not
directly related to these claims.

However, the General

Accounting Office? on its own initiative, contending that it
had a right to review the determination as to substantial
■evidence, facts? and law, did so conduct a review, did block
the continuation of the negotiations and any payment; and,
after 33 months of consideration, rendered a 266—page opinion
in December of 1966, holding that s&E had no valid claim
against the government.

And, in its own comments in. the brief

of the government before this Court today, characterising this
as advances notice of disallowance•
Placed in this situation, the contractor brought
suit, in the Court of Claims.

The reference to the Commissioner

there resulted in his opinion recommending a finding for
Contractors.

s&E

This finding would be based on a breach of

contract? failure to pa:/ the administrative award, recognising
that the parties can contract for their own remedies, finding
that th© General Accounting Office was in excess of its author­
ity,

particularly stressing -that this was an ordinary type

?
of case in which there was no issue of fraud or overreaching
involved.

Mr. Creyke —

MR. CREYKE:

MR. CREYKE: Ccrrscfc.

Was there a reason why S&E waited so long to

That's almost three years.

MR. CREYKE:

Correct.

There was no legal reason why they had to with­

MR. CREYKE:

The law with respect to the right to

claim a breach of contract had certainly not evolved to a
point then when you could make a determination, in our judgment,
that, under those conditions a breach had occurred.
this was a judgment matter.

Perhaps

It involved, of course, the very

8
practical problem of a contractor in these financial circumstances
starting another action in the Court of Claims, which could
easily have resulted in even greater delay.
In hindsight„ it might have been better to do so,
Your Honor.
Q

One last Question while I have you interrupted.

Was tha advico that was sought by the certifying officer
chronol-.;, :;iq©lly ear 15or then tha decision by the Commission
itself?
MR. CREYKE:
Honor.

Xfc was between the two decisions, Your

Thure was a first decision in November '@3, where the

Commission granted a partial review and affirmed some of the
other claims.

The partial review had to do essentially with

tha timing statutes.

That was in November.

The request to the GAO was March of *63, and the final
decision of the commission itself was May 1963.
Following the decision of the commissioner, the
gavsimihfc sought request for review, review was granted, fell®
General Accounting Office filed an amicus brief in the Court
,;f C-.U'.;-; a, sind of course the Court of Claims opinion came down

on

:• to 3 decipiet, stating that there was no material

di.ffsvtuca h:M the non-payment came about, if th© case reached
'••'..Us court it would review it under the standards of the
Wunderlich Act.
Essentially the standards there would be th© standards

9

of supporting by sub^ranti.;al evidence the findings involved in
these claims.
tea tins opinion of the Court of Claims remanded the
case to its Commissioner for such a review.
The dissent saw the case in what we believe to be
the broader issues and feh® important issues? that is, that it
is necessary for the court to give guidance in -how the
machinery of the government in handling disputes processes will
work out.

It pointed out that the Atomic Energy Commission

Tha Genera1 Accounting Office was not a

pi-rty end not authorised to act. The Department of Justice's
attorney was not authorised to act in the matter, unless th©
agency delegated with the responsibility of carrying out the
function sought its intercession.
Also it was very strongly stressed that this would
have a chaotic effect on the operation of the disputes clause
which is so essential to the government as well as to
industry in doing business with the government.

And the people

were entitled to certainty, and that under thee© circumstances,
with doubt existing and with th© rights existing, apparently,

in various parties to take issue with the determination which
apparently had

over a long period of time, into a state of uncertainty.

contractors but upon bankers, their sureties, their supplier®,
their subcontractors, and others *
This developed vehicle of the disputes clause has
proved very workable and vary advantageous to government and
to contractors ©vex a period of years.

whereby the government's work can go forward, it can change

in our judgment, want to cover government work, or if they do

so they will set up large contingencies in any bids they make,
and it will disadvantage everyone.

Interpretation of this presents a very perplexing
problem.

This is so acknowledged by anyone who has had to

deal with it.
In the initial hearings, when it was proposed that
an Act be sot up, there was a provision in the bill then
proposed that the Comptroller General be set up as a layer of
review along with courts of competent jurisdiction.
Objection was made to this by industry, by attorneys,

by officials of tho government agencies who were concerned
with creating ar cs-5 her layer of review and impacting on their
abil

y to implrrasnt feta government's business•

That

provipioi was ti.k.-,n out of the bill and, in the summation of
fche report, the final draft of the bill, it is stated very
clearly that there was no intention to change the powers of
the General Accounting Office.
It's most difficult to separate the position of the
government and the General Accounting Office, and we say they
are inseparable. We say it was envisaged that the General
Accounting Office would have certain powers to intercede in
these proceedings.

We believe it was intended that they b©

13
limited t©'the papers that they had before the Wunderlich
Act in "54 was adopted. And w© believe that those powers only
relate to prohecfcir-.c: th© go©i5r:©:©sint from fraud and overreaching

before tha Court of Claims, end to which the answer nnd petition

ware addressed.
The General Accounting Office did not change that
decision.

The Department of Justice did not change that

decision. They;3 has br®n no review in the sense that th©

patitlcruvc «lie;,;®: which has altered or in any way interfered
va. tu ch-v :ca,mio E_a?i',:cy Commission, estcept to suggest that the
dec-i.vicn itself was not. final and, not being final, that
payment could

be mad® thereunder.

Now, ' .to Mramic Energy Commission may disagree with
that*

It may feel that the decision which it handed down is

16
sound*.

Even 30, it seems to me it is the height of prudence,

if a suggestion is reads to it by GAO, by its own general
counsel, by any respected attorney, that if there is doubt cast
on whether or not the criteria for finality, as enunciated in
the Wunderlich Act, have not been met, then payment should not
be made, as one way in which judicial review can be compelled.
So that the standards of finality may be applied to
that decision.
Furthermore, it might very well be suggested, if it

is: not so, that pryiaffinfc would have been improper under those
circum®t.tnces because payment is only required in connection
with a final decision of an agency or a board of contract
appeal.
Nov;, the General Accounting Office did nothing more
than review 'this.

They reviewed it in response to a request

from a certifying officer.

That certifying officer was acting

under a statute which gave it, gave him the permission and the
authority to seek

n advance opinion as to what the accounting

treatment would he in the event a payment which ha was asked to
make be made.
The General Accounting Office, in considering that

But I heart, bellsv© that it precipitated fcha suit
any mors than the certifying officer precipitated th© suit
in addressing an inquiry fc© it.

What did precipitate the suit

by tii© petitioner, instead of by the government, was the failure
of the Atomic Energy Commission fee make payment.
Now» the legislative history, which the petitioner’s
brief devotes a good deal of space to, is, in our opinion,
significant only in that it show® that Congress did intend
for access to the courts to test the finality criteria of that
Act, to he available to both parties and not to one.
She petitioner, it seems to me, peas far afield when
h© ..e.ei;-;.v.i.v5es his ^eaarks to the role that the GAG was at on©

ti ® *ntv^ded to play in this situation.

Soto of the* statutas,

not the initial one, but shortly thereafter, included th©
c&noral Accounting Office as a level of review equal to that

of’th© court.
At that point, there was much opposition to th©
inclusion of the General Accounting Office.

emm ixtm

The opposition

industry and from government and from the private bar*

tut 'this review is not the review that

%?m

ever granted it*

That review was the right to change that opinion, to modify it,

20
reverso it, to make a binding determination on both contractual
»
parties just as would a court.
Now, th:nk was eliminated.
It didn't do it now..

Xt no longer has that.

This raviaw didn’t change any part of the

decision.
That feeing so, the legislative history is only
helpful for the other aspect for which it is mentioned by both
parties, and that is whether or not Congress intended that
judicial review would be available to both parties, the govern­
ment and the contractor.
And in that connection there were proposals submitted
to the Congress expressly to limit judicial review or access
to the courts to seek judicial review to the contractor alone.
The Congress did not adopt any of those proposals•

Qrts -of tooo' proposals was made by the American Bar
Association.

Their proposal confined judicial review to on©

, d by the contractor.

This wasn't merely something that

wao : v--o'r'V-;f" to tea Congress which nicy have bean overlooked,
bacaut-a one of the leading witnesses before the committee,
Mr. franklin Schultz, addressed himself specifically to that
problem.

He pointed cut that the bill, as proposed and as

enacted, would on its face appear to make judicial review
available to both parties.
And whan Congressman Hyde asked him what was — pointed
out that that was precisely what it would do, Mr. Schultz said,

well, fchis'c1» whnt discvsfc-s r»«*»

Prscieely what disturbs him.

And then proposed that the ABA proposal, which confined it only

to the contractor, be adopted.

And that was not adopted.

r£h© congressional committee, at least, that was considering it

was wsll &;wsra of the request by some few people that it be
limited to the contractor.
Hot only tbsfc, Mr. Creyko says that at no time did

:inyc;v* asstm® tf• zi. anyone but the General Accounting Office
would be an avenue for review on behalf of the government.
sifca congressional history shows that Congressman

Willis was asked ^pacifically the questions Who, on the part
of the government, would ask for the judicial review?
And his response wass

The Department of Justice,

the Department of Defense, as 'well as the General Accounting
Office.
Share vma nothing here that wont by unnoticed.

And

i-h.3 testimony, even the report, indicates vary clearly that the

as it did to the contractor.
And that both parties should have a day in court,

ME. JAPPS?

Yes, if you use the word "review" in th©

Bens-s of making the litigat.lv© determination which ia the

We do not instituta ©wife at

in which an agency is sued.

Indeed, in a situation identical

to this one, not too long ago, where an agency did refuse to
make payment in accordance with a board of contract appeals
decision, and the contractor sued in the Court of Claims.

We did not answer that case, because our review, preparatory

Q

Mr. JaffeL ~~

MR, JAPFEs
Q

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice Blacknmn.

Is your ^--(the remark you just made, your

explanation of why this issue arises only in 1971?

It seems

to m it’s a lafce-date for it to arise.
MR, JAPPS$
. u-.i'ti-.. -

Well, it is,

And I’m not certain, Mr.

tliss I can give you an adequate answer.

: don't know why it has arisen in this form, or in any form

ai this time, because X had always been of the impression that
it was & generally conceded right for the government to challenge
a board decision that was favorable to the contractor.

Indeed,

in thti L&ngenf©.1 dsr case, fell© Court there, Judge Davis, in'a
footnote, or perhaps in the body, lists many cases in which
precisely that was don© since at least the Wunderlich Act.
It’s very difficult to go earlier than the Wunderlich
Act, because there was very little to review. And it worked

be.‘-a ways *

Neither the government nor the contractor could

upset a decision, except in case of fraud or overreaching.

Q
old?

Of course the Wunderlich Act is what, 20 years

MR. JAFPSs

Yes, it is *

Now, 2 would like to touch briefly on the role of
this Department of Justice in all litigation.

1 have alluded to

it already.
But, an this Court knows, the relationship between
the Department of Justice and its client agencies, if i may
pafar th&t way to fell© various. departments and agencies of the
government, is not the saias as the ordinary attorney-'client.

review of what is proton tod by any litigation, that, is either
defensive or prosecutive, ©ad that decision is on important ©ns.
Therefore, as in this case I wish to point out that
/

yha Department of Justice was not involved afe any stage in the
dispute process prior to the decision of the Atomic Energy

For the petition to suggest -that we

That is not

Now, 1 wish to point out here that some of the

case, is the suggestion that the board of contract appeals ™~

I should add that there is no suggestion,

Mr, Jaffa, if we assume that the Comptroller

MR. jAFFBr.

Ho amounts have been determined. Tim

Comptroller General determined no amount —

Negotiation?

MR* j&FFEs

in this particular case, assuming that

any of the claims of the contractor ar© upheld, either way,
either as a result of judicial action or by this Court saying
that the action has already been taken and no one can question
it, there still would have to be negotiation between the
ccvt:;v;\d-tfsr and tbs Atomic Energy Commission •

No amounts have

been determined.
I wish to add —

of events —»
MR, JAFFEs
Q

Yes, as a matter of fact —

— couldn’t it?

MR. JAFFEs

As a matter of fact, the Commission, in

its decision, in sending it back to the contracting officer,
did bo expressly with the subject to return ft© the Commission
if there was any objection or any dispute with respect to the

amounts.

Yes, that's quit© so.

I wish alco to point out that this Court and tha
e-'txrh f f CX&inrs will r.0ver knew, quite properly, wheit the

Now, the GAO opinion is before the Court in an

indirect way, because the court*0 commissioner asked for it,
and got it as © public document.
Q

Did he make any specific findings with respect

to my part of th® Comptroller General*» report?
MR. JAPFE:

No, except — no.

Not with respect to

No one he.® considered, and no one has ever

Do you see any ambiguity, Mr. Jaffe# or lack of

clarity between tbs main body of Section 321 and th© proviso?
Or do they — do they meet end to end, or is that a gap there?
MR. JAFFE:
Chief Justice,

No, I don't think there's a gap, Mr,

I believe that in the first sentence, or the;

clause before the proviso , is specifically Congress’ intention
to overcome, in so.many 'words, the Wunderlich' decision.
s@cti.on 322 overcomes, in so many words, as I see it,

I believe that is the cohesive whole, with no
incon©latency.

Yes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY CREYKE, JR, # ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CREYKEs

Thank Your Honor.

I would like to just question one or two things that
the Deputy Assistant Attorney General has said, and snake final

comment.
With respect to the. recitation of the history of the
Wunderlich Act and the exchange between Congressman Willis
and Franklin Schulfes, Esq.* we have on page 0 of our Reply
cvatdnvcd teo discussion which the government adverted
ho,

01:6.

pointed out there that in the final exchange Mr.

Kill is c;j±-:} to Mr, Schults:

"This judicial review referred to

in that postage fcaore referring to a review by the GAO, when
GAO has bean left out deliberately as compared to S.24?
"Well, that is persuasive, sir.”
In other words, the exchange was not concluded in
v

>

tlis government's brief or in Ini® government1 s comments here.
With respect to the opinion of the Comptroller
General, it is pointed out in that opinion, as wall as in its
own comments, which are in the Appendix to the government's

3:.i
brief in this cme, that S&E Contractors had no valid claim
against the govarnm-ant.

They are quoting in the Appendix

her© their determination.
♦

*

Also, ©3 I * T-s stated previously, they describe that
get!on -ts nn advance disallowance of payment,
Tbo goyarajasut has undertaken to state that w© think

h$t the government has no rights in situations other than
fraud.

Our position is not thus.

Our position is that the

government8s rights have been properly protected by the
agency with fully qualified persona®! and legal staffs under
normal circumstances to deal with the routine business, end
that the certainty and finality and the powers of that agency
to deal with the missions and responsibi11ties assigned to it
demand for the government asd for contractors that it carry out
those powers without being susceptible to collateral attack
in ordinary circumstances.

Departs **nt

has brought

out,

in the opinion of the Attorney

General in I960, that it has a coupon law right to pursue
vrhete^er raeacf, e:j exist for payment® und©£ .mistake of lew or
mistake of fact„
The reference to tbs Langenfelder case, I respectfully
disagree with, tea.

There are one or two cases cited in the

kangenfelder opinion where, in the dictum, Judge Davis did
make sent© comments with respect fee the powers of the Genera!

36

Accounting Offlae.
However, an examination of those cases will show that
in non© of them was there any such review as this, ever conducted»
In other words, a comprehensive review of ® complicated,
interrelated claim, essentially involving questions tinder the
contract*
f na of the c&sss cited in bangenfelder involved a
3-:s,;keasrge after termination? another required a right to
recover back interest from the Stats — excuse ms, from the
contractor, which he'd recovered from the State of California
under an agreement where there was a cost-plus contract.
But in no case was there a comprehensive factual
review such as this, and in fact in the decisions of the Court
of Claims, to the best ©f my knowledge, an is©tie has not been
raised with respect t© this point.
We raise the issue not because we'r® hare to fcsil th©

government how it ehowld be run? we would rather not.

w®

would rathor you’ collected our money in 1961 or '62, or at least

in 1964 and gens on about our business.
inotsed, we lie her© inert while other agencies
assert what wo conceive to b© essentially abstract power.

The

government has complete control over government contracts and
over regulation® and, indeed, through Congress, over th© laws
interpreted by this Court.
If they want to do, as th© Department of Transporta-

felon has recently done, and set up a precise echodele for

c

review of its board of contract appeals decisions, it can do
so.

But in doing so, X think it will destroy the efficacy

of the changes

clause and the disputes procedure, and it will

in effect detract from contractor’s interest in participating
in goverment v/ork.
X seriously question whether the agencies desire tha
result which fch© Court of Claims majority opinion would yield
in this case.
Where do th® powers stop?

This Court has said

clearly and unag.ui vocally, in tha Mason a danger, in the antecodent eesea, flat where there is a delegation of a factfinding function to a representative of the United States, it’s
not; to bo challenged by anyone in th© auditing departments, and
expressly ruled in that case.
a
This unprecedented action has worked a disaster on
this contractor.

He’s spent ten years flat on nis back,

unable to proceed, still not being paid for the money expended.
I ask this Court to deal with th© whole problem, to restore tha
disputes process to the manner in which it has traditionally
worked, and which would inure to tha benefit of th© contractors
and; .government alike.
Thank you very much.
