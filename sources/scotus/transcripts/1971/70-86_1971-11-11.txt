MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

in No. 86, United States against Tucker,
Hr. Tuttle», you may proceed whenever you8re ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITITIONER
MR. TUTTLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court:
This case involves the question of the propriety of
the use in a 1853 sentencing hearing and sentencing proceeding
of records of prior convictions in 1938, 1946, and possibly
1950, which were obtained in the absence of counsel, or
alleged to have bean obtained in the absence of counsel.
Tucker was convicted in 1953 of the robbery of a
federally insured savings and loan association.

He was

convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern
*v

District, of California.
Now, the evidence in the case, which consisted of four
eyewitnesses ana fingerprint evidence and testimony, is
conctededly overwhelming, and the validity of his conviction
and the strength of the evidence against him is not challenged
in this proceeding or before this Court.
Tucker took the stand in his own defense in these
proceedings, in that trial, and he was cross-examined with
respect to certain prior State felony convictions.

4
He was cross-examined with respect to and admitted
a 1938 conviction for theft of an automobile.

H© was cross-

examined and admitted a IS46 jewelry store robbery in Louisiana.
Me was cross-examined with respect to and admitted a conviction
for armed robbery in 1950«,
He was shortly thereafter convicted of the crime of
robbery of & federally insured savings and loan association.
Thereafter, the judge, the trial court conducted a
sentencing hearing, at which it took evidence with respect to
■the defendant Tucker,

With respect to these convictions, which

I have mentioned, certain further evidence was brought out.
It was brought out, with respect to the 1938
automobile theft conviction, that he had served seven of the
ten years which had been imposed.

With respect to the 1946

jewelry store burglary, that he had served 45 months out of a
four-year sentence.

And with respect to the 1950 armed robbery

conviction, that he had served no time because he had escaped
after a sentence of five years was imposed.
Other information respecting the defendant was also
brought out.

It was brought out, for instance, that he was

under indictment in Los Angelas for another federal armed bank
robbery, which was to proceed to trial immediately after this
sentencing.

It was brought out that ha was a suspect in four

other federal bank robberies and seven or sight armed robberies
of local savings and loan associations in the San Francisco

5

area.-

And the evidence with respect to those robberies was

elicited,»

That is to say, that there was evidence, eyewitness

testimony and

fingerprint testimony with respect to those

other charges and investigations against the defendant Tucker.
Tucker was sentenced to the maximum permissible term
under the statute providing for armed bank robbery of e federally
insured bank, which is 25 years.
Now, later on the same year, the State of California
brought proceedings against Tucker for armed robbery, and he
was convicted of four armed robberies under California lav;»
This proceeding occurred under the California recidivist
statute,

bo

that the indictment in that case charged the four

armed robberies and in addition charged two of the three prior
felony convictions I’ve mentioned, the 1938 auto theft and the
1946' jewelry store burglary.
Following this Court’s decision in Gideon vs. Wainwright, Tucker successfully attacked first his habitual
offender status in California and later on the underlying
California conviction for armed robbery, on the ground that the
us© of those two priors had been prejudicial, inasmuch as h©
had not had counsel in 1938 and he had not had counsel in 1946.
Now, following the State court's vacation of those
two prior, 1938 and 1946, convictions? that is to say, its
finding that there had been no counsel, Tucker brought a motion
undor 2255 attacking the conviction which is the subject of

6
this case, the bank robbery conviction, alleging that the us©
in cross-examination of those two priors which were concededly
uncounseled, and also alleging that the use of the 1950
conviction which had theretofore not been challenged as
counseled or uncounseled, had prejudiced him when it was used
for cross-examination and impeachment purposes.
Nov/, the District Court and the Court of Appeals
both found that -the use of uncounseled priors was improper,
but they found that the error was harmless because of the over­
whelming evidence against the defendant in the case.
The Court of Appeals, however, found further that
those priors had been used at the sentencing hearing, and at
the sentencing hearing the judge might possibly have relied
upon them, and the Court of Appeals said that the reliance
couldn't be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under Chapman
and remanded the case for resentencing without the use or
reliance upon the uncounseled prior convictions.
Tnerefore, the case is b@fo.re this Court now at the
request of the United States to determine whether the Court of
Appeals was correct in remanding that case for reconsideration
of sentence,
The question which this case presents in this Court
is whether a particular rule of evidence, specifically an
exclusionary rule of evidence, should b© applied to sentencing
proceedings so as t© deprive the sentencing judge of knowledge

7
or reliance upon prior convictions which w©r© obtained without
to© assistance of counsel prior to Gideon.

And it seems to be

common ground among all the parties in this case that a judge
should have access to and should be entitled to rely upon all
reliable relevant; information concerning a defendant’s character.,
background, habits, or disposition, which can be brought before
the sentencing judge.
Are th® prior‘conviction® which are at issue
here, were 'they pleas of guilty or not?
MR. TUTTLE: The IS 38 auto theft conviction was a: pies
of guilty.

Th© IS46 burglary, jewelry store robbery, was a

plea of guilty.
Before this morning X had been ©£ the impression that
the 1950 conviction had not bean challenged.

Within th© hour,

Mr. Reppy showed m© a copy of ‘the 2225 motion in District Court,
which was net made a part of the record certified to this Court,
which indicates they also challenged th© 1950 conviction.
Now, the 1950 —
Q

Was that a pi©a of guilty?

MR. TUTTLE?

I believe it was, but I simply dors31.

know, because X had thought that that conviction was not being
challenged before this Court.

We are informed by the clerk of

•the Dade county Court, because we inquired with respect to this,
that petitioner did have counsel during the 1950 proceeding.
1 should say that th® respondent Tucker alleges in his

8
brief tnat h© didn't, have counsel.

That question was never

decided, Mr. Justice White, because that, 1950 conviction was
not on© of the two priors that w.-js alleged in the California
racividist prosecution, and therefore not one of the priors
with respect to which a hearing has been held.
Q
say?

Wall, what did the Court of Appeals in this case

Did it just refer to the two?
MR. TUTTLE :

The District Court simply held that the

use of priors, uncounseled priors, without making specific
findings, but acknowledging the United States admission with
respect to the 538 and "46 priors, that they were uncounseled,

said that the use of uncounseled priors in cross-examination
would b© bad,
Q

Don't you think it makes a difference in this

cas© for your argument as to whether the prior convictions at
issue were pleas of guilty cr not?
MR. TUTTLE:

I don't think that that is a dispositive

consideration, Mr. Justice White.
and 846, were pleas of guilty.

I know that the two, '38

As I say, I had believed until

today that the 1950 conviction was not being challenged at all.
U

Did he deny the previous convictions or the

crimes at the trial?
MR. TUTTLE: At the-trial, and 1 think this is quite
significant# he neither denied the convictions nor, as I wanted
to say with respect to the 1938 and 1946 convictions, he not

9
only did not deny those convictions, he admitted those con­
victions , but h© went further, ha admitted the underlying
conduct.
Q

So ho not only didn! t deny the underlying conduct

but he admitted it by hia plea of guilty?
MR. TUTTLEs

H© admitted the underlying conduct and

I think that insofar as there might b© a question about the
reliability of uncounseled conviction, this cannot to© considered
in the facta of this case.
1 call the Court’s attention to page 24 of the
Appendix.

With respect to the 1938 automobile theft, the

question about that conviction:
"Answer:

It boils down to this, I was 1? years old,

broke into a man’s garage, took his automobile, went joy riding
in it, and received © ten-year sentence for it.”
So h© admits the conduct.

He says it was joy riding,

but he admits he took the car and went from the man’s garage.
With respect to the 1946 jewelry store burglary,
against on page 24:
page 25:

"Where?”
^Ouastions
"Answer:

"I broke into a jewelry store.”

And on

!5New Orleans."
Day or night?
At night."

So that with respect to those two convictions, th©
question of whether counsel — whether the absence of counsel
makes th© conviction unreliable doss not appear before this

10
COVtZt.

With respect to the 1950 conviction# we *— the record
as it now stands indicates that there had been no determination#
first of all, whether there was counsel or not? no judicial
determination.

We have made inquiries and we have bean told

and we recite in our brief that the Dade County Clerk indicates
to us that counsel was supplied.
The respondent Tucker# in his brief, says that he
didn’t have counsel, and there has been no determination of
that fact.
But we submit that it seems to us; that all of the
considerations ©f modern criminology calling for the individu­
ation of punishment require that a sentencing judge have all
relevant information before him which would help him in
determining that punishment; and that would include evidence of
uncounseled convictions.
The application of ordinary rules of evidence# or,
in particular, an exclusionary rule of evidence to the
sentencing proceedings would# it seems to us, deprive the judge
of valuable information concerning a defendant’s background, a
defendant’s character# and disposition.
Now, in Williams vs. New.York# this Court specifically
refused to apply ordinary rules of evidence to sentencing
proceedings# and specifically recognized that the application
of ordinary rules of evidence would frustrate the purpose of

II
individuation of punishment,
You will recall that in Williams the judge had a
report that, the defendant was involved in soma 30 other
burglaries» in addition to the murder which was the charge in
the indictment*
Q

Just hearsay information# too» was it not?

MR. TUTTLEs

Just hearsay information# Your Honor.

And this Court — and the judge relied upon it# said he reHad
upon it# acknowledged that there had been no convictions
.‘pastil,ting from those reports of other burglaries# and, as you
will recall# sentenced Williams to death.
Now# in this case also the sentencing judge had
before him substantial information concerning this defendant9b
criminal activity, which had not resulted in a conviction,
uncounseled or not, or an indictment..

There was the allegation

that this defendant had been involved in four federal bank
robberies# the allegation that he had been involved in seven
or eight armed robberies of savings and loan institutions#
and the sentencing judge was told by the witness he was
examining for this purpose that the evidence was substantial,
that it was substantially the same as it had bear, in this trial#
■teat is eyewitness testimony and fingerprint testimony.
And the use. of that, information, which is allegation
of criminal conduct falling short of a conviction# counseled
or not# is not challenged in this Court.

.12

It seems to us fch&t it would ha ironical if it war©
proper for & court to rely upon such hearsay infarctionhr*
Chief Justice describas it, rely upon that information in the
assessment of sentence, and yet would be deprived' of reliance
on the same information when it matured into a convie
merely because the conviction was uncounsalod.
New, v/o know

'in

this, case that there is no doubt thsfc

Tucker committed the .1938 and th® 1946 violations, bar-or. ..•• f
admitted that he did.
But we submit that even uncounseled convictions,
where there have boon no such admissions, are no more unreliable
tnan much of th© evidence which has historically and tradition­
ally been considered proper for a sentencing judge to rely
upon.
We also would point out to this Court that the use
of uncounseled convictions in this context, as some evidence
of criminality on the part of the defendant, is totally
different from the us

such convictions under ordinary

recidivist statutes.
There the- prior convictions -automatically increase
the exposure or

vasfe the mandatory mini

the

fact of conviction that creates automatically a.harsher
sentence.

And in that case, we submit, the conviction

operates to deprive the judge of discretion, with a mandatory
incre as © in--. s &n ten ce

13

Whereas the inform-:: tioa here- , fch© uncounscsled
conviction and the information suggested is merely being used
to inform the discretion of the court, to give the most
intelligent, individual treatment to a particular offender.
For this reason we think that this Cotart's holding in
burgett vs. Texas has no application to the facts at bar.
How, quite apart from the question of whether a
sentencing judge should be permitted to rely upon uncounseled .
convictions, the law seems clear that, a sentencing judge can
rely upon the conduct which underlies that conviction, and
any competent evidence of this criminal conduct, any reports
of this conduct would be permissible information for tint judge*
to us© even if he couldn't rely upon the fact of'ties conviction
itsalf.
Paid m submit that, any rule which would exclude the
reliance upon such conduct, falling short of a conviction, would
deprive the judge of much valuable information which courts
have traditionally, historically, end properly relied upon? a
charge might be dropped because a prosecuting witness didn't
appear, or it might be dropped at an exercise of prosecutorial
discretion.
y

Or by the suppression of evidence, some heroin

seized from his person.
MR. TUTTLEi That is
distinction, Your Honor.

1 think that's an important,

There are cases, even sentencing

cases? where suppressed evidence has not been used or permitted
to b» used as information before the sentencing judge.

Jind

the rationale of those cases is part and parcel of tbs whole
deterrent rationale of the prospective application.
The theory ©£ the courts that forbid the use of
illegally seised evidence in a sentencing hearing; I suggest
that if it were permitted, a prosecutor or the police could
deprive an individual — would be encouraged if they had
enough evidence to seise a parson for a narrow crime, would be
encouraged to ©nag© in rampant searches thereafter; figuring
that once .they could convict him of the narrow crin«s „ thoy
*

could, put in everything else on a sentencing hearing and
obtain a maximum sentence.
Q

Who was it who said that?

MR. TUTTLE*

Q

Who said that?

MR. TUTTLE:
Q

Your Honor, the case is —

Well, if you don’t have it, —

MR..TUTTLE:
Q

It's a Circuit Court case —

What Circuit?

MR. TUTTLE:
Q

I'm sorry?

— Verdugo —

' — at your fingertips.

MR, TUTTLE: And 1 can’t tell you the Circuit, but
it is cited in the respondent’s brief.
But it seems to me that the rationale that ««* the

deterrent rationale, vshicfc would prohibit the use of tb&t
evidence, albs.it significant evidence# is distinguishable from
this ca.ee# where we're only concerned about the issue of
reliability.
It’s commonplace in. presentencc reports., for instance,,
for a probation officer or the prosecutor in baling to fch©
probation officer, to try and put the defendant in a context of
criminality, which may not be revealed by the indictment or
the trial itself, to give the sentencing judge some idea of
tuis person’s place in the entire criminal scheme.

That hind

of information has always been included in presentation reports *■
out it’s information that may enhance punishment and is not
sworn, and is not usually subject to cross-examination• and yet.
it’s in formati, on which we feel ought properly to be before-» the
sentencing court,
Further, even regardless of the reliability of feh&
conviction, it seems to us that incarceration that results, as
a basis of — as a result of uncounseled convictions, are
information which a sentencing judge should have before him.
The Court will notice in this case, at the age of 17,
•*

.•

Tucker is convicted of auto theft.

He’s sentenced to ten years

in jail; he stays in jail until mid-1945, released in mid-1945;
he's promptly convicted again in 1946,
until mid-1949,

Stays in 'jp.il from 1945

Released in the middle of 1949, he promptly

commits an armed robbery in 1950,

He’s sentenced on that, and

16
he escapes.

But less than a year later, in 1951, fee commits

tae crime which is the subject of this case.
Thus, from the age of 17 and from 1938 to 1951 Tucker
spent the entire intervening period With months csxooptianc: in
jail.

Nov;, it seems to us the sentencing judge could not

rationally individuate the punishment or the treatment of
Tucker in ignorance of those facts.

And X think that

respondent Tucker really admits that when he suggests t>at
pernaps that information should be before the sentencing judge.
Now, 1 think, finally, Your Honor, there1 is no real
evidence in this case that the sentencing judge relied upon
fcnese prior convictions in imposing the sentence which he did
impose.
The judge was specifically told in this case that
Tucker was a suspect in four other robberies, federal robberies,
seven or eight other savings and loan robberies, and he was .told
the strength of the evidence with respect to those.
told about a pending indictment in Loa Angeles.

He was

Now, the j-udge

specifically said he would not consider the pending indictment
in Los Angeles, because, in essence, that case would take care
of itself.

It would be a sentence appropriate to that offenses.
Biit his statements — and these occur at. the and of

the sentencing hearing

indicate the matters which he truly

relied upon, and those are these pending investigations.

This

occurs on page 37 of the Appendix, and with the Court’s parmis-

It appears in the form of an order

in looking at the record that is docketed hare, I didn’t find

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. PJ5PPY, JR.» ESQ.»
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. REPPYs

Mr. Chief Justice» and may it pleas® the

Courts
Counsel for th© United States has characterised this
case as an exclusionary rule case.

But Mr. Tucker character­

ises the case» and I think the Ninth Circuit majority and
dissent did also» as a prejudicial

error case.

And that»

Your Honors» it is» so long as Gideon vn. Mains;right is retro­
active .
Th© reason that w© arc referring» both counsel» in
our argument sc often to the record and reading portions of the
record to the Court is that whether the Ninth Circuit correctly
decided this case turns on whether this record offers some
hint that an injustice occurred; that perhaps th© sentence
would have been lower if Judge Harris, in 1353, had realised
that there had been no reliable adjudication of guilt of the
three prior convictions» 1938, 1946 and 1950.
Q

Are these prior convictions the ones that

appear on 24 and 25; that is in 1938» breaking in and stealing
a. ear, 1946 the jewelry store, and 19- — a later period, not
identified, breaking into another store in Hew Orleans?
are you talking about those?

ms what difference it makes, what the circumstances of the
convictions were, when, at the time of this hearing, '•••he
affirmatively described his conduct to the judge?
MR. SEPPYs

Well, let me state at the outset that Mr

Tucker, as you will note in his •

in propria persona written

opposition to writ of certiorari, admits guilt of one of those
three priors.

Q

He claims innocence to two --Well, but is this incorrect, the Appendix pages

?A and 25?
MR. REPPYs

No, sir, it is not.

Now, you notice,

Mr.Chief Justice, that he does not make an admission as to the
1950 prior.

Our focus here is on his statement ,!I broke in

and stole a car.”
Undoubtedly it can foe read as an admission.

1 think

also, in view of what happened, and how this cams up, we can
construe this portion of the record as Mr. Tucker describing
himself as the defendant, describing what he' was charged with.
Her© was the quandary h® was in.

“What kind of car did you steal?"

“1946 I

"Where" — and so forth.

He goes on to describe the

cities and then still a fourth one, apparently not relied upon,
was his admission that he was a fugitive from tba State of
Florida because he fled his five-year sentence when ha was in
the hospital for som© medical treatment, away from the prison.
Now, do you suggest that the court, the sentencing
court can't take into account his conduct in sentencing as
distinguished from the recidivist factor?
MR. REPPY:

Not at all.

No, we do not view the

Ninth Circuit ruling in any way as precluding the court, upon
remand, from considering the conduct.

In fact the Ninth

Circuit's majority concluding paragraph specifically state®
that the resentencing is to occur without any consideration
of invalid convictions, And unquestionably, if his resentencing
hearing is held, the conduct involved would be gone into.
Q

Well, if the invalid conviction is supported now

by what amounts to a judicial confession in open court, at, a
time that he*a represented by counsel, would you still maintain
that?
MR. REPPYs

Yes.

For two reasonss

some judges in the

exercise of their discretion at sentencing simply do not
consider charges and proof of guilt other than a conviction.
The authorities which are recited in respondent's brief make
that clear.
The particular reason isn’t given»

It seeme to be

a compartmentslxsation by the judge, a rule-of-thumbs

I

consider convictions, I do not consider charges which hava not
■

resulted in a conviction*
In Connecticut, for example, th® judges do not
consider charges that have not. resulted in a conviction*
Now, how Judge Harris approached'this, we can only
speculate, as we know that he would not consider the Los
Angelas charge, because that was coming up to trial, and what
he stated, and what Mr. Tuttle read, on page 37, as to the
Northern California charges in State court, I would submit, is
simply ambiguous.

It may be saying, I know I'm giving a heavy

sentence on the basis of what occurred, and 1 do realize that,
it may bs increased, but I hope it won’t foe.
I think that the remand procedure would bring the
clarification that'we want? and finally, Mr* Chief Justice —
Q

As to the third of these convictions, the one

from which he fled, when he was in the hospital, fled to
California, he said right at the time of sentencing, as I
read it, that he was innocent of that*

I'm looking at page 35

•the defendant's statement to the sentencing judge.

MR. REPPY;

Mr. Justice —

Do I read that inaccurately?

MR. REPPY:

X do believe you do, Mr. Justice.

was going to ©ay the word "both” after the word “of',

Ho
If you

notice the content there, he describes the prior convictions —

Q

Yes.

MR. REPPY?

— "and the five-year santsne© that was

given ms", that's IS50, *1 was convicted by a judge — the smrr.c
judge that gave ms th© five, gave me th© ten to start with#”
— that's IS38 in Floride —
Q

Yes.

MR. REPPY$
Q

Then he says, "that's neither her© nor there".

MR. REPPYj
Q

— "and X was innocent of" *iind he: stops.

"That's neither hear nor there” and —

"But I mean h® found me guilty and subsequently

I escaped and came out h©ra."
MR. REPPY:

I think it's susceptible of th© interpreta­

tion consistent with his in propria persona opposition to th©
writ# that he considers both ©f his Florida convictions improper,
in that "1 was innocent of" both is what he was going to say.
But now that we have read this passage, which I planned to
read later to th© Court# I would like to consider why Mr. Tucker
stopped ,his explanation

on

allocution, he was beginning to give

evidence in mitigation, to explain, and he then stopped
suddenly, and he says,

"that's neither hem nor there", and

26
there seems to be only two possible

reasons that he stopped :

the first on© is that he realized, or believed that the
convictions than not subject to collateral attack, because
Gideon had not been decided, were conclusive.

And, as noted

in respondent’s brief, there was considerable authority at that
time that that was so, whether that be authority -that commends
itself to our .logic, it seems to be irrelevant because defense
counsel, who 'was there at sentencing, perhaps had told Mr»
Tucker not to get into that.
The other possibility is that Mr. Tucker felt he would
simply urge Judge Harris, by protesting innocence, of matters
for which he stood,as th© law then read, validly convicted»
And Judge Levsnthal of th© D. C. Circuit, in his concurring
opinion in the Scott, case, which is cited in respondent's brief,
states that the overwhelming majority of sentencing judges,
in his view, do not like to sea a defendant before him
protecting innocence after a 'lawful conviction.
So it*s quite possible that had Mr. Tucker had the
benefit of Gideon, Mr. Tucker and his counsel at that time, he
would not have stopped, and we would have soma explanation
here of these incidents, th© 1938 incident, when he was 17, and
the 1940 — 1950 incident in Florida.

And it is reasonably

possible that he might have convinced Judge Harris —•
Q

But he could.

was found by fch© District Court to be a Burgett.vs. Texas error
to receive these three priors at the guilt determination.
It was found by the ninth Circuit to be error.
Burggitt has been retroactively applied.

It’s not a matter *m

have briefed here, but this issue is before the Court, if it
lochs at page 24, of the transcript her©, to determine what
happened.

Because that is the poisonous fruit of that error,

in it earn© th® three priors, which wer® unreliable and un~
counseled, and th® poor man, trying to rehabilitate himself
in the ©yes of th® jury, in effect, confesses.

He might have

been lying — not likely, but he might have been.
He might have decided the best thing to do was to
tak© advantage of his age, which was 17, and to try to get some
sympathy from the jury by, in effect, confessing and saying —
Q

This testimony on 24 was — did occur during

th© course of th© trial bafore the judge —
MR. REPPYs
Q

Yes, and before the jury.

~~ and then what begins on page 27 is at the

28
sentencing proceedings t is that right?
Or at page —
MR. REPPYs

Yes, where they say that the agent is

present in court, this agent, in effect, delivered a verbal
sentence report.

So, as soon as — when that begins, the

sentencing proceeding has begun.
Q

Mr. Happy, if — I realise that time has gone by,

but suppose that the court had given him something less than
the maximum sentence.

Would you be .here?

Would the same

principles as in your case apply?
MR. REPPYs

1 don't — Mr. Tucker would be out of

prison, sir, to begin with. But assuming that, the time
difference
Q

Well, that's why —

MR. REPPY:

1 would be — 1 would be here, if he

was willing t© take the risk of ffgrth Carolina vs. Pg.ag.tey of a
higher sentence, and go back in there end ask for reconsideration,
I would be her®.

Because I think that the remedy that consuendis

itself to the Court, and a remedy which is followed, apparently,
in the Fifth Circuit, is that findings should be mad© by the
sentencing judge as to how he was affected by the improper
materials before him.
Q

Well, first of all, of course, if it were not

too much less than the maximum, he might still be incarcerated?:
MR. REPPYs

That’s correct.

29
Q

For 23 years *

But it is your position that

Worth Carolina vs. Fnarcc has application in this kind of a
situation?
MR. HEPPlfs

Oh, it is certainly not necessary to

decide, but I would as sura© so, that what the Court wrote there
permits a vary limited consideration of prison incidence, so
long as there is actual proof of thorn, and that they are net
hearsay.
On the procedural matters
Q

Mr. Reppy, do you really want us to hold th©

responsibility of State judges to make findings before they

santenc©?
MR. REPPYs

Q

Ho, Your Honor.

Well, 1 thought that's what you said.

MR. REPPY;;

Wo, Your Honor. The findings, I feel,

should be made upon a Section 2255 motion, if it's s federal
prisoner, or upon the State court habeas motion whoa a State
prisoner goes before the judge end says,

"Your Honor, you
i

considered information that was wrong.B
Since this Court decided Tovms&nd vs *. janrke -in 194 8
there have bean., perhaps, two do sen reported cases like this,
applying the Townsend vs. Burk®, principle that due process is
denied where there is substantially unreliable information
before the judge.

And uniform procedures s&em to be. Your

Honor, to send the petition back to the sentencing judge if ha

30
la available, and g-st some finding from him, if he can
reconstruct it, as to how he was affected.
And 1 would assume if he cannot reconstruct it, he
should make finding® as to his normal practice in dealing with
prior convictions and arrests.

Because, as noted, particularly

in the annotation A.L.R. that I've cited, where the annotator
went quite — picked up sentencing decisions from all parts of
the country, the majority approach seems to ba to simply
disregard unadjudicated charges.
Q

Well, 1 don't understand how we can require this

finding every time a judge sentences somebody.
MR. EEPPYi

It would ba useful if he made? it then,

but it is not necessary.
Q

I didn't say that, but how can we compel him,

just because it’s useful?
MR. REPFSf5

I would not compel it, Mr. Justice

Marshall.
Q

Well, don't you think w® should compel it in

the federal courts befor© we go over in the State courts and
compel it?
MR. EEPPY:

Well, it is not necessary that this

federal case her© be extended to the state.

Because this is

a federal conviction, and it arises under 2255, which allow®
for a non-constitutional collateral attack on sentencing.
Q

Right

MR o PEPPYs

And if your feeling 1b that you wish to

limit this principle to the federal judicial system, I think
it's quite proper to do eo, and that there is precedent with the-Law!s case- in the Court, of Appeals, which I have cited in
respondent6s brief
Q

Do yon realize that I would assume that every

district, every federal district ha® a different procedure as
to how to handle presentence reports?
MR. RSPPYi

I’m certainly sure that is so, but

1*ro not —
Q

Do you realize that in most districts today

the prosecutor doesn’t have anything to do with it?
MR. REPPY% Well, I "wasn’t aware of that, but I
think that the — regardless of what procedure was original Xv
used at sentencing the procedure mentioned in the Fifth circuit
decision of Putt vs. ..United States in 1966 is the desirable
procedure to handle a collateral attack.
wow, in the Putt case there was a Federal prisoner#
a Dyer Act prisoner, sentenced to a federal prison# and he
submitted a 2255 motion in which he alleged that the sentencing
judge had before him on the presentence report an entry that
this man had been convicted of burglary# and an entry that
this man had raped someone, a girl, and the judge took this
and I believe, although it’s not clear, without holding an
evidentiary hearing or without appointing counsel, h© changed

32
the record of tho sentencing and he made extensive findings as
to what he would have done or how he would have reacted had
the entries been false and had ha known That.

And hir eonolusio?.

hob that there was so much other criminal .activity on the

record that he would have given the same sentence in any event,
because the additional burglary and the additional rap© didn't
make that much difference.
Now, that may be true in our case.
of criminal activity.

There was a lot

But I don't see any reason why it's too

much, to ask of Judge Harris, who is still sitting, to make these
typ© of findings.

1 feel that he ought to have done so when

the motion originally cam© up to him, as Mr. Tuttle has
indicated, Mr. Tucker, the prisoner and respondent hare in
propria persona filed a petition under Burgett. vs, Texas
attacking the conviction-itself on the basis of what we've
read at page 24 and what preceded it when the priors ware.
f

introduced to impeach him.

He did not, in his original moving

papers, mention the sentence.

The government did not, in its

reply .papers, mention the sentence.
The judge then wrote the opinion, which is in feh©
«*»

Appendix, which doesn’t mention sentencing at all.

The opinion

relies heavily on the record to indicate that as far as impeach~
m@rs.fe went, there was harmless error, because the man was
thoroughly — Mr. Tucker was thoroughly discredited on rebuttal
evidence, and this is true.

And then, after this opinion came

33
down from Judge Harris# Mr. Tucker filed what he labeled a
petition for rehearing# which go©© on for several pages, laying
out what happened at sentencing and requesting resentencing*
and Mr. Tuttle has accurately described Judge Harris's
response to that.

A terse order sayings

R&hearing denied.

The petition raise© no new issue that warrants reconsideration.
And it was ® new issue# if the Court please, because
instead of weighing the prior© as impeaching devices against
the testimony ©£ guilt and the discrediting testimony, the
judge should have then weighed the priors as evidence of guilt
against the other evidence of guilt as was dor,© in the Putt
case, to m& if it would have made any difference.
Q

What would yon suggest if it were not the same

judge who tried him or sentenced him?
•MR. REPPY:

I would suggest that if that judge were

available# perhaps in retirement —
Q

Well# let’s say he is not# he's off the bench,

he’s deceased cr ~~
MR. REPPY:

If he's deceased# a sentencing judge or a

District Court judge hearing a 2255 motion can only put himself
in the position of a sentencing judge, and said, would it have
affected me?
Q

And I do believe, Mr. -well# why wouldn’t you just set aside the

sentence and send it back to the sentencing court for
resentencing, before whatever judge is available?

34
MR. REPPY:

If the opinion is — why should not this

Court?
Q

No, whywouldn't —

finds that uncounseled priors were

let’s assume a 2255 judge
usedP why shouldn't he

set it aside and require resentencing?

If the prior judge

isn't available?
MR. REPPY:

That would be proper.

And it would seem

if h® is the sentencing court/ he could do the resentencing
himself.

On the other hand/ he could

simply reach the sam©

result if the resentencing was not going to decrease the term Q

Well/ you wouldn't resentence him just in the

2255 proceeding/ would yon'?
MR.

REPPY; He would put on a new rob©, I would

understand —

I am not. certain how it is don©, but I would

think that if the sentencing judge was gone and we were in 'the
particular district and division, where he was sentenced
Q

I suppos© you’d have to get up the — I suppose

you’d have fco have —
MR. REPPY;
Q

a sentencing hearing.

MR. REPPYs
Q

and counsel would —

And counsel would be available.

Yes.

MR. REPPY;

The Putt case lends itself to the

point that no evidentiary hearing need foe required in cases
where the sentencing judge can state with assurance that he was

not affectede the procedure in the Putt case of the Fifth
Circuit,, and that perhaps this problem never would have arisen
if Judge Harris had only, Instead of denying that rehearing
petition, mad© some findings, they could have been so conclusive
on the point that Mr* Tucker would have had no basis for appeal.
Q

Well, if he hadn5t been of that opinion, how

could he have clan led the motion?
MR* RBPPYs
Tucker v?as seeking.

H© could have misunderstood what Mr*
I would — the papers are rather clear,

it would seem, but the statement there is no new issue is
wrong? and suggests perhaps a misunderstanding.
Wow, on the
Q

It was labeled, you say, petition for rehearing?

MR. REPPYi;
Q

Petition for rehearing.

Are you suggesting Judge Harris may have thought

indeed it was, addressed to the use of these on the issue of
guilt rather than on the issue of sentence, even though -MR. REPPYt
Q

if he had read it casually —-

Well, is thfc what you're suggesting?

MR. REPPY:

In all candor, though, Mr, Justice Brennan,

it!s a well-written petition for rehearing, and Judge Harris
should not have mistaken it for what it was.
Q

Well, on that, let's assume that he had just said

•petition for rehearing denied.

How could he deny that without

saying t© himself, well, this wouldn't have made any difference

anyway
MR. HBPPYs

1' think that’s procedural error in that

we simply don’t have a record for appeal, and it’s simply a
matter of the desirable procedure to cut down on the appeals
that go on in collateral attack proceedings.

It’s best for

this Court# and/ as the Ninth Circuit seems to indicate it
wants, to require the sentencing judge to take whatever time
it takes? 20 minutes, to —
Q

We don’t require that out of judges? passing cm

the voluntariness of the confession.

The confession is in a ~

if they say just denied, it's voluntary? we don't require any
exposition, and the Townsend case ©ay© we will

if a man

gives a clear ruling, the kind of a ruling he's supposed to
give, yes or no, you assume regularity of it.
MR. REPPY;

But that may be so wtugn it simply says

denied? but here v© have "raises, no new issue", and yet on the
face of it there is the potential for prejudice,

it is

possible that Judge Harris believed that Mr. Tucker was guilty
of these throe prior convictions and as to two of them, if he
had not felt that it was '''neither here nor there", if he had
known of his right to collateral attack, he might have
convinced the judge and received a lesser sentence.
Q

This sentencing was back in 1953?

MR. REPPYs
Q

That's correct.

Judge Harris, that’s George Harris?

37
MR. REPPYs
Q

And he’s still —

MR* REPPYs

Q

Yes.

MR. REPPY;

Q

Yes.

Ha’s still there.

We have checked.

And this was a 25-year sentence?
Yes, it was? the maximum.

Where is Mr. Tucker now?

He won in the court

of Appeals, and —
MI?.. REPPYi

He remains in federal prison in Washington,

and although ho states that he is entitled to release in 1972,

Mr. Tuttle advises that h© has checked with the Bureau of
Prisons and -that the mandatory release date appears to be
1973.

So there is some uncertainty about that.

Q

Hasn’t he been released in light of the judgment

of the Court of Appeals?
MR. .REPPY;

No, he has not been, as I understand it.

I have been receiving mail from him from Steilacoom, Washington.
Q

He's in prison on this same charge?

MR. REPPY;
Q

That, is correct.

On the eerne conviction?

MR. REPPY; That is correct.
Q

But he has — oh, excusa me.

Q

l .have the Appendix in my hand, I’its looking at

pages 24 and 25.

What judge was presiding over the. hearing

when this examination on pages 24, 25 end 25 took place?
MR. REPPY?

Judge Harris is the only District Judge

38
involved in this case at all proceedingsi
sentencing, the 2255.
Q

the trial, the

It's the saw® judge throughout.

Do I understand your argument to be that he

could not take into account the cumulative admissions and
statements made as reflected in those three pages?
MR. REPPY;

Not at all, Your Honor.

Had there

th«s

two points I'm making are that ha should have» taken into
account, under the proper context, if he knew that this man
was speaking about these convictions under the belief that ha
was conclusively presumed guilty, he might have discounted it,
because the fact that the man believes he is conclusively
presumed guilty rather limits his explanation. As he cut
himself off by saying “that’s -slither here nor there" when he
started going into an explanation.
Q

Well, i don't read this as any very truncated

inquiry, I thought his explanations of his criminal conduct
were very expansive.

He could hardly have described more

unless he gave an inventory of what he had stolen from the
jewelry shop.
MR. REPPY?

Well, Mr, Chief Justice, the man does not

contest his guilt of the jewelry store robbery.
Q

There w$re two jewelry store robberies.

MR. REPPY s The 1946 jewelry store» robbery «

He does

— and he never did admit at any point in the proceedings
guilt of th© 1954, the conviction? and, as Mr. Tuttle has noted.

39
Judge Harris has never ruled on its validity, although tlx©
validity question was before Judge Harris.

And for that

reason —
Q

Is he still subject to imprisonment by

California?
MR,. REPPY:

Ho, he is not.

if ho violates hi.?3 parol©, he io.

He is on parol® on -■••-

He is on parole on a

conviction of on© set of robberiesj as to the other set of
robberies, to© Appendix to respondent's brief indicates that
the charges were dismissed, and they cannot be brought again
because — to my belief, because of the statute of limitations,
in California.
Q

And these were the California proceedings

relating to conduct after the conduct for which he was *•**» for
which he is

now

in

prison?

MR. REPPYs

l am not certain.

I don't think th©

record indicates which bank robbery occurred at what point in
time.
Q

In any event, there —

MR. REPPYs
Q

On© of them was federal — excuse me.

In any event, they are the ones that Judge Harris

said h© wouldn't consider when h© was ~~
MR. REPPY:
Q

It'S —

— during the trial or at sentencing.

MR. REPPYt

It's extremely ambiguous, Mr. Justice

40

White, what Judge Harris said he would not considar.

It's

very clear that he was not going to consider the Los Angeles
charges.
Q

But he was convicted after sentencing here* he

was convicted in the California courts?
MR. REPPYs
Q

Yes* he was.

And he•s on probation — ha never served any

time there* I take it?
MR. REPPY:

I am not certain whether he was serving —

whether he was moved down to- a California prison to serve the
two federal and State sentences consecutively.

I do know that

the ones that he is not under parole about — on which he's
not on parole are those which are discussed in the Appendix
to tii® brief.
I would like to allude briefly in argument to the
point mad© in Part III of respondent's brief* and that is that
Judge Harris in 1953, when he was sentencing petitioner, had
no way to know that petitioner had previously spent 11 and a
half years in prison wrongfully, because of unreliable convic~
tions, convictions which were made without counsel.

Perhaps

the judge would have wanted — to have shown some leniency.
Now, we have his statement afc the bottom of page- 35 of the
Appendix:

"There is no room for the Court to entertain elements

of great sympathy because" Mr. Tucker was using a gin, even
though he didn't point it afc anyone.

41
But there was earn room, not for great sympathy, for
some. And if there was only sympathy of a matter of two years
or three, Mr* Tucker would now be — have finished his sentaince,
it appears.
The Third Circuit cases, tine District Court cases in
the Third Circuit have developed a theory of relief given on
2255 in habeas corpus that it is only fair and just to return
a sentence to the sentencing judge for reconsideration when
it appears after sentencing that the man, the defendant has
served tin® in prison on wrongful convictions. The thought is,
I believe, to give a littl© mercy to make vp for this wrong that
has been done to him, which cannot be righted in any other

way.
And certainly insofar as factors in retribution and
deterrence of others, two of the four factors that are
frequently considered at sentencing, so far as they are
involved, there is room for mercy, because of the prior time
in prison. And in Mr. Tucker's case, not only was h® in
prison, ha was on a chain gang for five and a half years.
And that that means, I do not know.
One other point in respect to the passage on page 24,
Mr. Chief Justice,, that 1© concerning you, is that Mr. Tucker,
in 1953, may never ham consulted with ®n attorney about his
criminal responsibility for this 1938 robbery.
Now, on the basis of my correspondence with hisa, which

42

1 am not, going to go into because they are off the record, I
think that he might have developed a duress defense, if he
had had a chance to talk with an attorney about this.

And

while he admits,. "1 broke into it, I stole a car**, it doean41
negate a possible defense that would limit the criminal
responsibility and make him seem less evil in the eye, or less
wicked in the eye of Judge Harris in 1953, when sentencing
occurred.
Certainly soma further explanation of what happened
might, have been proper*

And also, Your Honor, in respect to

the Florida conviction, the fact that he served seven and a
half years, a very severe sentence, might have indicated to
the sentencing judge that there was something terribly
wrong.

Wouldn’t it to you, Your Honors?

for a 17-year~old joy ride?

A ten-year sentence

Something terribly wrong scams to

be there, a very vicious crime,

Mr. Tucker may have fait that

he could not explain, as we know, "he felt my guilt"', "that's
neither hero nor there", and if for no other reason than to
allow him now to give hie chance to explain without feeling
that he's pr@clu.ded because of the conclusivaness of a
conviction, the remand order is appropriate, and a procedure
for the future that would bo appropriate is to require or
direct the lower courts in this type of case to go through the
motions which do not take very long end which do not.require
an evidentiary hearing of explaining, as was done in Putt vs,

43
United States in the Fifth Circuit., of explaining why there:; la
a denial.

And this will permit appellate review and we will

not have the speculation which the dissenting judge wan
bothered about in the Ninth Circuit.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Floppy.

You have five minutes more, Mr. Tuttle.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE, ESQ'. ,
ON BEHALF OF TEE PETITIONER
MR. TUTTLEs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

First, Mr, Chief Justice, you asked the citation of
the Verdugo case which related to the us© of evidence which had
bean seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
Ninth Circuit case, Your Honor.

That's c*

It's 402 Fed 2d 5S9»

With respect to petitioner's contention that at
the sentencing hearing he protested innocence and he meant to
say "both", that is to say both the 1338 Florida conviction
for auto theft end the 1950 Florida conviction for armed
robbery? as I read the record, and 1 have nothing outside the
record to rely upon, it seems to me. Your Honors, that what he
is saying with respect to the auto theft is that that was a
/

joy rids, that wasn't grand larceny auto.

I mean,

"I did it

but ife wasn't a crime of that magnitude”, and that's the sens©
of innocence which he is asserting.
Now, I'd like to address myself very briefly to

this notion of conclusiveness which Mr. Happy has raised.
Thera's an extensive portion of the respondent's brief
addressed to the notion and to the rule ©f law that for
certain purposes convictions are conducive evidences of guilt*
And that arises principally in impeachment proceedings where
a parson is often not. allowed to explain that "although I was
convicted, I wasn't in fact guilty".

That only arises in

context where rules of evidence apply, and I submit that in
importing conclusiveness into sentencing, respondent commits
the same error that he is attempting to do when he wants to
import the rules of evidence into sentencing generally.
Whereas we would claim that the rules of evidence do
not apply and any reliable information can be used, we would
maintain the same with respect to any doctrine of conclusive-

ness.
.

I can't conceive of a probation officer, if a

defendant being examined by him for the purpose of preparation
of a presentence report says, "Yes, I had the X conviction and
t

.

the Y conviction, but I didn't do it? I didn't have an attorney
or 1 didn't do it, or I was under duress".

I think that all

of the books which have been collected in respondent's brief
and all of "the learning that the Court may find on the
subject of sentencing and the preparation1 of presentence
reports indicates that these gentlemen, the probation officers,
are trained to be open-minded and trained to include every-

45
thing, anci. X don't think the doctrine of conclusiveness would
ever preclude a defendant in a presentenoe report from alleging
his innocence or circumstances in mitigation.

I simply feel

that conclusiveness has no relevance in this case.
Q

Of course this was back in 1953 when procedures

may have been, and apparently were, a little different*.

All

this oral report is something that i© not. very usual today.
MR. TUTTLE: That is correct.

In this case it appears

that the judge acquired his information orally.
I was addressing myself to the more general problem
of whether conclusiveness would create any bar.
With respect to the matters that Judge Harris con­
sidered, I would like to address myself to that vary briefly,
because, Mr. Justice White, you raised a question about that.
I think that if you read the record, it's clear that he diet
not rely upon the pending federal Los Angeles indictment, but
that he did rely upon the seven or eight pending State
investigations, four of which later, in fact, did result in
convictions, and which war© later collaterally attacked.
Bo I think that his -*■* the things that he didn't
rely upon was the situation where there was an indictment and
in the judge's eyes the indictment was going to take car© of

Q

But did I understand that if he were released

from federal prison today he would still be on probation from
California?
MR. TUTTLE:

I don't know the answer to that.

That's what —Q

Mr. Happy seemed to indicate that.

MR. TUTTLE:

— Mr. Reppy represented, yes.

Finally, X would simply repeat that it is quit©
clear to the government in this case that any problem about
the reliance on these sentences or questions has been answered
by the judge himself, when he said, when, he denied the motion
to reconsider sentence on the basis of the us® of those
priors. And I think no useful purpose could conceivably foa
