CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Today's orders of the Court

have been duly entered and certified and filed with the Clerk
and will not otherwise be orally announced.
Mr. Clerk, the Court will entertain motions for
admission to the bar at this time.
(Motions for admission to the bar.)
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments in

No. 70-29, Giglio v. The United States.

Mr. LaRossa and Mr.

Sachse.
Very well, Mr. LaRossa, you may proceed.
MR. LaROSSA:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
May I introduce Gerald Shargel of New York City,
who assisted me on brief.
Petitioner Giglio was convicted in the Eastern
District of New York of two counts of violating Title 18,
Section 2314 and one count of conspiracy in violation of
Title 18, Section 371.

That conviction was affirmed by the

United States Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit.
Thereafter, a motion was filed in the District
Court under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure*
That motion’s denial and its affirmance by the 2nd Circuit
Court is the subject of the petition before this honorable
Court,

4
The facts, briefly stated, are that, one, Robert
Taliento, employed by the Manufacturer’s Hanover Trust Company
in New York City as a cashier, removed the signature cards of
a depositor of the bank, one George Cohen, and on three
separate occasions deposited stolen checks, money orders, into
that account and withdrew the proceeds of the money with
respect to those three checks.
Mr. Taliento was apprehended by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.
Thereafter, he made an appointment with the
petitioner Giglio and met the petitioner Giglio who was
arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
A grand jury thereafter indicted Mr. Giglio and
named Mr. Taliento as a co-conspirator but not a defendant.
Mr. Taliento testified at that grand jury.
At the petitioner's trial Mr. Taliento was the
main witness against the petitioner and, frankly, without
his testimony, the petitioner could not be convicted.

He was

the only witness to describe in any detail the petitioner's
acts since the petitioner was never observed at the bank nor
did the Government ever allege that.
Mr. Taliento was the main focus of the crime since
he withdrew the money and allegedly gave the proceeds of
these checks to the petitioner Giglio.

So, without his

testimony, t3ie Government could not have proceeded against Mr.

5

Giglio.
As a matter of fact, referring yon to the Government's
affidavit in opposition to this motion, which is found at page
130 of the appendix, the Government states "Taliento was the
only witness to Giglio’s acts," the petitioner's acts.
QUESTION:

Mr. LaRossa, I have not yet looked at

the original transcript but could you tell me whether, on the
whole record, it shows that the jury was fully aware that the
witness x*as named as a co-conspirator in the indictment?
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Is it the practice in New York to send

the indictment into the jury?
MR. LaROSSA:

The practice in the Eastern District

of New York, Mr. Chief Justice, is to read the indictment to
the jury so I must, although not being trial counsel, assume
the indictment was read to the jury and they were aware he
was a co-conspirator, not a defendant.
I also should add that trial counsel for the
defendant, petitioner, argued to the jury that he x?as named
as a co-conspirator and not a defendant in the case, so
the jury was certainly aware of that fact, sir.
Petitioner's trial counsel at that time attempted
to show Mr. Taliento’s interest in this proceeding, that he
was an interested party, that he had bias and prejudice as
such a witness.

He tried to elicit the fact that Taliento

6

had an express agreement with the Government.

Taliento

denied this again and again.
Referring you to page 4 of the petitioner’s brief,
just making short reference to some of the questions and
answers that were given, the questions read basically as
follows — this is Taliento on cross-examination:
"Q

Did anybody tell you at any time that

if you implicated somebody in this case that you
yourself would not be prosecuted?
"A

Nobody told me I wouldn’t be

prosecuted.
"Q

They told you you might not be

prosecuted?
"A

X believe X still could be

prosecuted.
*'Q

You were told, were you not, that you

could be prosecuted in this case, is that
correct?
"A

Yes.

"Q

Were you told that you would not be

prosecuted if you testified against somebody
else?
"A

Not that X wouldn’t be prosecuted.

"Q

What were you told?

"A

That there is still a chance I could

7
be prosecuted,"
When asked about his grand jury testimony, he was
asked the following questions, which appear at page 45 of the
petitioner's appendix:
"Q

When you went to the grand jury, you

went there to help yourself, isn't that right?
"A

I was just advised that I was supposed

to be before the grand jury,
”Q

I can't hear you,

"A

1 don't know if I was helping myself

or not.
“Q

Did anybody ask you while you were at

the grand jury if you wanted to help yourself?
"A

Not that I recall.

"Q

Were you there in effect to help

yourself?
"A

The only reason I went to the grand

jury is because I was subpoenaed."
QUESTION:

I am not sure I get all the inferences

that perhaps you want to leave with us on that answer.
MR. LaROSSA:

Mr. Chief Justice, I am going to get

to the point of showing you that an Assistant United States
Attorney at the time that Mr. Talient© testified before that
grand jury gave he and his counsel an absolute assurance of
immunity.

8

QUESTION:

I am well aware of that but I am going

to the response that you seem to emphasise that he said he
was there because he had been subpoenaed.
MR. LaROSSA:
subpoenaed."

"I was there merely because I was

That was the only reason that he left with that

jury, that he was not there to help himself and he was not
there based upon any agreement with the Government that he
wouldn't be prosecuted, Mr. Chief Justice.

He was there

because he honored a subpoena that was served on him.

That

is basically the premise I am trying to bring to this Court
and I think is the absolute suggestion that the witnessc
testimony gave to the jury on that particular occasion.
But if Mr. Taliento's testimony did not leave an
absolute impression upon that jury that he still could be
prosecuted, then we need only look to the Government's closing
arguments.

At page 119 of the appendix, the Assistant United

States Attorney in closing to the jury said he, referring
to Taliento, received no promises that he would not be
indicted.
I most respectfully submit that the impression that
was given to that jury on both the Government's direct case
and the cross-examination by petitioner's counsel was that
the witness was taking his chances in coming before that
court and testifying, that he still could be indicted, that
he still could be prosecuted, that he had no assurances from

9

anyone, "anyone" particularly meaning any member of the
Government.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting the presence of any

perjury here at all?
MR. LaROSSA:

Yes, sir? I am.

I am stating that

there is absolute perjury with respect to this witness'
testimony and that is borne out by the Government's affidavit
in opposition.
QUESTION:

Well, you characterised it as perjury

rather than misunderstanding on Taliento's part.
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

Need you go so far?

MR. LaROSSA:
Blackmun.

That is correct, sir.

No, I don't believe I do, Mr. Justice

I don't think I have to.

I think whether he

misunderstood or not, certainly the Assistant United States
Attorney in that courtroom had no right to misunderstand and
as I will get to further in my argument, he should have had
an absolute knowledge that the witness, Taliento, was
testifying before that jury with an absolute grant of immunity
given to him by an Assistant United States Attorney.
QUESTION:

To carry that a little beyond, if, in

fact, the Assistant United States Attorney did not know and
was making the argument in good faith, then is it not true
that that weakens your position?
MR. LaROSSA:

No, sir, I don't believe so.

I

10
think that if our foundation of constitutional safeguards has
to depend upon the fortuitousness of the fact that the
Assistant United States Attorney trying the caser and the
Assistant United States Attorney who makes the assurances to
a particular witness is one and -the same, then we are on
rather weak ice»

I refer to Judge Palmeri's decision, a

District Court decision in the Southern District of New York,
in application of Kopotas where he said referring to the
Napue decision, "I do not think that an accused's right as
defined by Napue should depend on a fortuitous circumstance
that the District Attorney who condxicts the prosecution and
the investigation be one and the same»''
Since I am referring to that, Mr. Chief Justice,
may I also bring to the Court's attention the Hawkins
decision from the 5th Circuit which clearly states basically
the same thing, and the Circuit Court there at that time in
1963 decided at that time these witnesses so

estified the

Government must be charged with the knowledge that their
testimony was.false.
There is another factor here, too.

If we carefully

read the Assistant United States Attorney's affidavit wherein
he tells us that he made a grant of immunity he tells us
that it was agreed upon between Taliento, his attorney and
he, the Assistant United States Attorney.

It was understood

and he also tells us that this was after a conference with

11
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Now, those of us who have had some experience in
the Federal Court know that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the case agent who handles a particular
case — and in this particular case it happened to be Agent
Axton — who was a witness at this trial, would be the one to
receive this information, so not only does the Assistant
United states Attorney who gave the grant of immunity at the
grand jury know about this but we must assume that Agent
Axton and the FBI had the same knowledge.
QUESTION:

Did any record show the power of an

Assistant United States Attorney to grant immunity?
MR. LaROSSA:

Well, the affidavits in opposition,

Mr. Justice Marshall, state that an Assistant United states
Attorney has no authority to grant immunity and an affidavit
from Mr. Hoey suggests that this can't be done.

Judge Ryo's

decision was based in part of the fact that an Assistant
United States Attorney has no right to grant immunity but
I respectfully submit to this Court that if a hearing was
held at that time, I, as a former Assistant United States
Attorney in that district, could have testified, as could
any assistant in that office, that grants of immunity were
made as a regular course to get a witness to cooperate with
the Government.

It was a known fact.

QUESTION:

And the United States Attorney didn't

12

even know about it?
MR. LaROSSA:

At times he did, sir, if it was

important.
QUESTION:

I am saying you mean a United States

Attorney can grant immunity to a man charged with treason and
nobody has to know about it and it is effective?
MR. LaROSSA:

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I say

yes, it is.
QUESTION:

It is?

MR. LaROSSA:

Yes, sir.

Further than that, if that man under that grant of
immunity testified before that grand jury and then that
testimony v/as introduced against himself, would this Court
uphold that?
QUESTION:

I am not talking about the grand jury.

I am talking about prosecution.
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I understand your point.

You say that Assistant United States

Attorney can say that you are charged with treason but I grant
you immunity and you will not be prosecuted.
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall —

Let me ask you this —

MR. LaROSSA:

I don't know whether there is any

particular regulation on treason -QUESTION:

If an Assistant United States Attorney

13
told this man that you won’t be prosecuted,, could Mr» Hoey
prosecute him?
MR. LaROSSA:

I don't believe so, no, sir.

In

fact —
QUESTION:
prosecuted?

Could the Attorney General order him

Could the President of the United States order

him prosecuted?
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

I don't believe so.

You don't believe it.

MR. LaROSSA:

I think this Court would prohibit his

prosecution.
QUESTION:

What ground do you have for that?

MR. LaROSSA:

I may add the Solicitor General, in

his brief —
QUESTION:

What ground do you have for that?

MR. LaROSSA:
please the Court.

Due process and fair play, may it

One who gets the assurance of an Assistant

United States Attorney acting on behalf of the Justice
Department in that district, he should be allowed to rely
upon any promise that is made to him by any member of that
staff.
I respectfully submit to this Court that that office
is one entity and that any assistant acting under the
authority of the United States Attorney who acts under the
authority of the Attorney General —

14
QUESTION:

You and I know that the Eastern District

is not — hot*; many Assistant United States Attorneys do you
have in the Southern District?
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

I would guess 75 or 80.

And any one of those 80 on a well built-

up case that the Government worked on for ten years could
just on his own say I guarantee you won't be prosecuted.
MR. LaROSSA:

If that particular witness acts upon

that belief and understands it —
QUESTION:

My point is:

Can’t he grant him

effective immunity from prosecution?

You know what effective

means.
MR. LaROSSA:

Yes, I do, and I do believe he can

and so does the Solicitor General, because in his brief he
only states, Mr. Justice Marshall, that if an Assistant United
States Attorney did give such a grant of immunity the Govern­
ment would honor such a grant.
QUESTION:

Was Taliento prosecuted?

MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

No, sir, he was not.

Is it too late to prosecute him?

MR. LaROSSA:

Yes, sir, I believe it is.
f

QUESTION:

Is there any reason why he wasn't

prosecuted?
MR. LaROSSA:

Yes, sir.

In the affidavit in

opposition to the motion, the Assistant United States Attorney

15
States «I gave hira immunity."

QUESTION:

That is the reason?

MR. LaROSSA:
hearing on this.

I assume that is.

We never had a

A hearing has been denied throughout on

the issue of whether or not an actual immunity was given or
not, but I take the affidavit of the Government in opposition,
when an Assistant United States Attorney — and still an
Assistant United States Attorney at the time of the motion,
I might add — states unequivocally "I gave him immunity,"
it was understood and agreed by the parties, including Mr.
Taliento, that Mr. Taliento's counsel would not let him
testify unless he did get such a grant of immunity and the
fulfillment of the agreement according to that affidavit,
Mr. Justice Brennan, is that the witness Taliento would then
testify at the trial.
When Mr. Taliento testified at the petitioner's
/

trial, he completed the agreement.

There was nothing left

for him to do.
QUESTION:

Mr. LaRossa, let's assume that the

promise was made in the first place as you describe by the
Assistant United States Attorney, and then in further
conferences the United States Attorney said, "I understand
that there have been promises made to you but I want you to
know that there was no authority to do it and I do not affirm
that and I want to let you know that you will be prosecuted

16

or that you may be prosecuted, you have to take your chances,"
and that is the end of the conversation„

Then how should

the witness testify at the trial when he is asked these
questions?
MR, LaROSSA:
fully.

He should testify at the trial truth­

However —
QUESTION:

He was made a promise but it was

purportedly revoked.
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

Let's assume that he didn't.

Let's assume

that he testified exactly as he did here but nevertheless at
the time of the trial he thought he could be prosecuted.
MR. LaROSSA:

Then, Mr. justice White, he should

testify —
QUESTION:

He should have told the facts.

MR. LaROSSA:

He should have stated exactly what he

did and the Assistant United States Attorney should have
corrected the entire problem.
QUESTION:

The important fact for the jury, I

suppose, is whether or not he thought he could be prosecuted
at the time.
MR, LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

Is that the important fact?

MR. LaROSSA:
be prosecuted

Yes, sir.

Two things.

Whether or not he could

17
QUESTION:

I agree there is wholly another question

of whether he told the exact truth or not, but in terns of
the impact on the jury the question is whether or not he
thought he could be prosecuted at that time in terms of the
impact of his testimony.
MR. LaROSSA:

Yes, sir,

I have a tendency to agree

with you.
However, I do believe that the defendant would have
had the right to rebut this understanding that he had even
though it was — assumed that it was —
QUESTION:

Oh, it might have come up sometime if

they prosecuted him, whether or not the first promise was
binding.
MR. LaROSSA:
I am referring to.

Mr. Justice White, that is not what

What I am suggesting is assume, as you

-stated, that the witness had the understanding that he might
be prosecuted whereas in fact the truth is he couldn’t have
been prosecuted.

Then that fact should have been made knoivn

to the defendant and his counsel for whatever use they so
chose because I respectfully submit this had to be a close
issue.

It was a one-witness case and the witness’ credibility

is the only important thing in the petitioner's trial.
QUESTION:

I don't know how you tie that up with

credibility if he thought he could be prosecuted and still
testified.

It might have a lot t© do with whether or not he

18

would testify..
MR. LaROSSA:

That is correct.

Mr. Justice White,

we are assuming.that what he says has to be accepted as a
truism even though in fact there is no truth to it.
I submit to you that if he got up on the stand and
made any kind of a false erroneous statement whether it was
in truth something he believed to be true or not the Assistant
United States Attorney prosecuting that case would have the
duty to come forward and correct that false impression.
I refer very quickly to someone who makes a mistake
about testifying before the grand jury.

If a witness stood

before the court and when asked did you ever testify before
a grand jury answered honestly no because he forgot that he
testified before that grand jury, then I respectfully submit,
Mr. Justice White, that the Assistant United States Attorney
must come forward and say the witness is in error, he did
testify before the grand jury.
Here itfhatever the witness believed to be true, the
United States Attorney and the Government had the duty to
come forward and say here he did have a grant of immunity.
QUESTION;

Regardless, your argument is regardless

of its impact regardless of its significance in terms of the
credibility of the witness.
MR, LaROSSA;

Yes, sir.

I do believe that the

truth of the transaction would be extremely important.

I

19

believe so as a trial advocate, if for no other reason.

I

think that a jury seeing a witness testifying whether or not
he believed he had an absolute grant of immunity but that
that jury knew he had an absolute grant of immunity and
further that the agreement went one step beyond and said
you must testify at the petitioner Giglio's trial and then
they would have the right to believe that he was a biased
interested witness and they would have the right to look at
his testimony again and to determine whether or not they
should closely scrutinize it.
QUESTION:

Mr. LaRossa, had there been no reference

at all on this subject in the closing argument of the
prosecution, would your position be the same as it is nov??
MR. LaROSSA:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe it

would be as strong, quite frankly.
QUESTION:

Just a difference in the strength.

MR. LaROSSA:

Yes, sir.

I think the fact that the

Assistant United States Attorney uses this in his closing
argument, that fact alone gives it such a greater amount of
credibility to the jury because now the Assistant United
States Attorney is making the same statement that he did to
the jury, and we must assume that it is an unsophisticated
jury because under this Court's rulings with respect to jury
selection now we are getting unsophisticated juries, we are
not getting juries that had 5 and 6 times been jurors in the

20

past but we are getting jurors now that have only sat on one
occasion, so when the witness says I don’t know whether I
still could be prosecuted, and I think I may still be able to
be prosecuted, and then someone representing the United
States Government stands before that jury and emphasises the
very same fact, then the degree of truth I think is enlarged,
so I do believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that the fact that the
Assistant United States Attorney in his closing statement
mentioned this and accentuated it to the jury makes it a
much stronger situation than it would be otherwise.
QUESTION:

Was the United States Attorney who

first made the promise, if one was made, still with the Govern­
ment when the petitioner was tried?
MR. LaROSSA:

Yes, sir.

More than that, Mr. Chief

Justice, he was still with the Government"when he submitted
the affidavit, which was long after all the appellant process.
He was still with the Government up to a few months ago.
He was an Assistant United States Attorney, I do believe, this
year.

Sometime this year, he left that office.

But when

he made that affidavit stating — this is why I can puzsled
at the Solicitor General's question of the truth of the
affida%Tit, because it is an affidavit submitted by the Govern­
ment in opposition to the petitioner's motion for a new trial
where they state in that affidavit, one, that he is an
Assistant United States Attorney at the present time, Mr.

21
Justice White, and two, that the acts that he refers to were
done at a time when he was an Assistant United States Attorney.
Mr. Justice Marshall asked me the size of the
office of the Southern District in New York.

I think the

size of the office in the Eastern District of New York might
become more important because at the time this case was tried
I don't believe there were more than ten Assistant United
States Attorneys in the Criminal Division and Carl Golden,
the Assistant United States Attorney who tried the case, was
in a Civil Division and was brought over specifically to try
this case.

I have no absolute proof to give to this Court

that Mr. Golden knew of the existence of this agreement or
did not know of it.

I am in no position to dispute his

affidavit, quite frankly.

But it the petitioner's position

with respect to that that he should have known about it,
that he has an absolute duty to inquire, that if Mr. DiPaola,
the Assistant United States Attorney who granted this immunity,
decided not to tell him or forgot it or in any way made a
mistake here, this Court cannot pass that burden on to the
petitioner.
QUESTION:

Mr. LaRossa, in at least part of the

appendix that I have before me there is a gap that perhaps
you can refresh me on.
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

You will recall when there was examination,

22

cross-examination by defense counsel about Taliento's appeax*ance before the grand jury, wherein he was trying to elicit
from him the response that he went there to help himself, he
answered "I was just advised that I was supposed to be before
the grand jury," and then there is a break at this point and
the witness9 memory was refreshed as to the testimony he gave
to the grand jury and the Court asked "Does that refresh
your recollection"?

Can you complete the gap?

MR, LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I can.

What was said to him?

MR. LaROSSA:

What they did was show the witness9

grand jury minutes where he testified at the grand jury, Mr.
Chief Justice, that he was at the grand jury to help himself.
The question was asked:

"Did you tell the grand jury at that

time, or does this refresh your recollection that you told the
grand jury at that time that you were there to help yourself"?
He said:

"Yes, it does refresh my recollection

that I told the grand jury that I was there to help myself."
That question and answer was given during the
trial.
QUESTION:

Mr. LaRossa, it is of no significance,

I suppose, but where is the petitioner now?

Is he still

incarcerated?
MR. LaROSSA:

No, sir.

Mr. Justice Holland

released him on bail after this Court granted the petition.

23

QUESTION:

He has served some part of his sentence?

MR. LaROSSA:

He has.

This liras the first time he

had ever been involved with the law, I might add, and bail was
refused on the Circuit Court level.
QUESTION:

Mr, LaRossa, how do you deal with the

meeting between Taliento and the other Assistant United States
Attorney shortly before the trial of this case in which the
affidavit shows that whatever might have been said at the
time of the grand jury testimony, at this later meeting the
affidavit shows that no assurances were given either to
Taliento's lawyer or to the Taliento*s, father and son, except
that they would have to rely on the good judgment and
conscience of the Government.
MR. LaROSSA:

I do believe, Mr. Justice Stewart,

that this Court should ignore those affidavits completely.
They were submitted in opposition to the defendant's motion
without the right of confrontation under Pointer v. Texas
and we do not know whether these actually did occur but let's
assume that they did occur.

Let's assume Mr. Hoey said you

have no grant of immunity, you must go in there and testify.
But then, when the witness does testify, at the point of
that meeting he still has not completed his immunity.

That

is the petitioner's point with respect to this.
QUESTION:
against your client.

Quid pro quo was for him to testify

24
MR. LaKOSSA:

Exactly.

But the day he was sworn in

at the trial and testifies, then we go back to Mr. DiPaola,
the Assistant United States Attorney who granted him the
immunity, and we examine all of the conditions that he put
forth in that and we find that Mr. Taliento has complied
completely with them and therefore his grant of immunity is
whole, secure and should have been made known in that court­
room.

Whatever occurred with respect to Mr. Hoey at that

meeting — and we don't know what happened because we were
never given the opportunity to ask anyone —
QUESTION:

We do have sworn affidavits.

MR. LaROSSA:
OUESTION:

We do have sworn affidavits.

And that is the same quantity and

quality of proof upon which you rely as to the earlier meeting,
the sworn affidavits.
MR. LaROSSA:

But my sworn affidavit comes from

the Government's affidavits in opposition, not from mine, Mr.
j

Justice Stewart.
As a matter of fact, the Solicitor General,
interestingly enough, disputes the fact that this meeting
ever occurred and puts forth untested affidavits as truth
with respect to the Hoey meeting subsequent to the grand
jury.

I submit that an affidavit of an Assistant United

States Attorney at the time an Assistant United States
Attorney and under the pressures that he must have been under

25
when he did prepare this affidavit and submitted it to the
Court must be considered by this Court to be true.
would it be given?

Why else

Why was he retained as an Assistant United

States Attorney months and years after this occurred?
But again, I have never had the opportunity to ask
anyone these questions.
out.

The hearing has been denied through­

But I submit that going back to the affidavit of Mr.

DiPaola — and I only have a few moments left — where he
is very specific about this, 1 assume that this affidavit
was read and reread and everybody must have had a voice in
it.

Mr. Hoey was a very competent and good United States

Attorney and I am sure everybody sat down and read this and
just didn't submit it, but he talks about Taliento and
Giglio being arrested and arraigned before the United States
Commissioner.

Then he says in the last paragraph of the

first page subsequent thereto and after conferences with
Special Agent Alberto Axton of the FBI, the case agent at the
trial and a witness for the Government at the trial, your
deponent conferred with the counsel for the witness Taliento.
Present at the conference was the attorney for the witness
and the witness and Mr. DiPaola*

It was agreed that Robert

Edward Taliento would testify before the grand jury as a
witness for the Government, that he would be named as a co­
conspirator and would not be indicted.

His attorney would

not permit Robert Edward Taliento to testify before the grand

26

jury if he was going to be indicted,,
This is written by a lawyer, may it please the
Court„
It was further agreed and understood, and I submit
that those words become very important, that he, Robert
Edward Taliento, would sign a waiver of immunity from
prosecution before the grand jury and that if he eventually
testified as a witness for the Government at the trial of the
defendant Giglio he would not be prosecuted.

That is not

an unequivocal statement.
QUESTION:

This case comes here originated in a

motion —
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

For a new trial.

— for a new trial on the basis of newly

discovered evidence.
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

Was there a hearing?

MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Was there any findings?

MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

No, sir, it was denied.

Just on affidavits.

MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Yes.

I mean other than just a denial of the

motion»
MR. LaROSSA:

Judge Ryo filed that, No. 1, the

27
United States Attorney was the only one who could give such
an immunity.

I could question that,

QUESTION:

Well, there are some square conflicts

between the affidavits, aren't there?
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

As to the fact.

MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

With respect to what?

No, sir.

Our facts were —•

How about Mr. Golden's affidavit?

MR. LaROSSA:

Mr. Golden's affidavit has conflict

with Mr. DiPaola's affidavit, another Assistant United States
Attorney.
QUESTION:

There is a conflict between the two, isn't

there?
MR. LaROSSA:

No, sir.

Well, as I read his affidavit, he said

Mr.

DiPaoia further advised that Mr. Taliento had not been granted
immunity.

MR. LaROSSA:

1 beg your pardon.

There is an absolute conflict in fact.

You are correct.

28

QUESTION:

I take it,, Mr. LaRossa, that the essence

of your argument is that whatever understandings and agree­
ments and discussions there are about not indicting or indict­
ing must be disclosed.
MR. LaROSSA:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Whether there is in fact a binding grant

of immunity or whether there is not.

If there have been

discussions that would lead a reasonable man to believe that
the prosecution was not going to be pursued, even if it could
legally be pursued, that circumstance must be disclosed to the
jury.
MR. LaROSSA:

As this Court held in Mathew, yes,

may it please the Court.
Mr, Chief Justice, in Mathew this Court said just
t

the fact that consideration may be given to this man — and
there was a question about that, too, but in Mathew this Court
held that that should have been made known to the Court and
jury.

We go a lot further —
QUESTION:

I didn’t understand you to foe asserting

here because you don’t need to that the prosecution has a
duty on its own motion to disclose it to the jury but only
that upon cross-examination if the witness doesn’t tell the
truth in response to questions in that area then it is a
denial of due process.
MR. LaROSSA:

That is correct, ?1r. Justice Stewart.

29

At that point, the Government must come forward.
QUESTION:

You don't assert that the prosecution

has an absolute right on its own motion to disclose all this.
MR. LaROSSA:

Absolutely not.

If the witness had

admitted that he had immunity, I think that would be the end
of it and the Government would have no burden and the jury
would be able to assess the witness' credibility with respect
to that.
I see both my lights are on.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you very much.

Thank you, Mr. LaRossa.

Mr. Solicitor General.
MR. SACHSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I think the petitioner began by giving very selective
views of the facts of this case, though I think that now most
o: the facts are out on the table.

I would like to take

tie petitioner's contentions in this order:
First, the petitioner contends that the Government
witness, Taliento, lied.

That is really what it is.

He

d-dn't tell the truth in court that the Government, knowing
tlat he didn't tell the truth, failed to correct him and the
petitioner also urges that the case was in some way shaky
aiy way because Taliento was the only witness for the Govern­
ment.

I want to start with that second point first.
I think it should already be clear to the Court

30
that Taiiento did not lie in this trial.

X think when the

Court granted certiorari in this case it may have been under
the opinion on the basis of the facts that had been presented
to it in the petition and brief that there had actually been
perjury committed in this case and the Government had failed
to correct it.

If there had been perjury in this case on

a substantial issue and the Government had failed to correct
it, I don't think we would be here, but there was no perjury
in this case.
What happened was this:
was two years ago.

The grand jury hearing

A week before the case comes up for trial,

fir. Golden begins his preparation for trial.
States Attorney.

The United

He contacts the United States Attorney who

handled the case and the grand jury asks that United
States Attorney whether any immunity or promises had been
given to Mr. Taiiento and was informed that Taiiento had not
been indicted because he was a young man, he was 19 at the
time that this happened, and the Government felt that he had
been over-reached by the older man, Giglio, who really —
I could get into this later — set up the x^hole transaction.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

How old was Giglio?
Giglio was about 26 or 27 at the

time.
QUESTION:

What you are reciting new is what the

trial assistant, attributed in his affidavit, are you not?

31

MR. SACHSE:

That is correct»

This is for Mr.

Golden's affidavit.
However, it was also made clear to Mr. Golden that
it was understood that Taliento would be a witness for the
prosecution and that that was also a reason that he had not
been indicted.
Now, with this in mind, Mr. Golden contacted Mr.
Taliento, the witness.
would not testify.

Mr. Taliento told Mr. Golden that he

Now, if there had been any agreement

beforehand — and we only know of that from an affidavit
two and a half years after the event — but if there was any
agreement beforehand when Mr. Taliento said he wouldn't
testify that agreement was over.
Now, Mr. Golden asked Mr.Taliento if he wou3.d come
into his office and talk to him.
he came in with his father.

Mr. Taliento came in and

Mr. Taliento's father said, "I

would rather have my son alive than have him testify and he
is not going to testify in this case."

Mr. Golden then set

up a meeting with Mr. Darienzo — who had been Taliento's
lawyer at the time of the grand jury proceeding and who was
still Taliento's lawyer — Mr. Darienzo, Taliento's father
and asked Mr. Eoey, the United States Attorney himself, to
come to the meeting.

They had several meetings discussing

this point with the lawyer and with everyone involved.
result of these meetings was that whatever had been done

The

32
before , it was made perfectly clear to Mr. Taliento that if
he did not testify he could still be indicted and prosecuted.
Mr. Hoey said to him that he should have been and could still
be prosecuted if he wouldn't testify.

It was also made clear

to him in the presence of his lawyer that if he did testify —
and here I think I would like to quote Mr, Hoey's affidavit,
page 144-A, which said that Mr. Darienzo did not claim that
his client Robert Taliento received immunity or liras made any
promises.

No assurances were given to Mr. Darienzo or to

the Taliento's except that they would have to rely on the
good judgment and conscience of the Government.
So here is Mr* Taliento, the witness for the
Government, going into the trial.

It was perfectly obvious

to everyone he had not yet been indicted.
QUESTION?

What is your construction of the good

judgment and conscience of the Government?
MR. SACHSE:

I think the Government was holding over

Mr. Taliento's head the possibility that he could still be
indicted if he didn't testify or if he got up and instead of
testifying the same way he had in previous times changed his
testimony to make it more favorable to the defense.
QUESTION:

Couldn't Taliento construe judgment and

good conscience that if he was at least an extremely good
witness he wouldn't be prosecuted?
MR. SACHSE:

I think he probably did construe it

33
•that way.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Is that a promise?
I think what it was was something less

than a promise but certainly an indication to him that if
he testified the likelihood was that he would not be prosecuted.
Mr. Taliento testified that way.

He was questioned

as to whether anyone had made an absolute promise to him
that he wouldn't be prosecuted.

He said "No.'”

If you read his testimony, he made it pretty clear
that he understood that he would likely not be prosecuted
but no one had pinned it down tight for him.
You know, this was not an SEC registration.

This

was a scared witness testifying in a trial being cross-examined.

I submit that if the Court knows about the meetings that took
place before this trial and then reads Mr. Taliento5s
testimony all Mr. Taliento was doing was reflecting what
Mr. Hoey had said to him.
QUESTION:

What bothers me is a matter of the facts,

and that is what you are now discussing, that the witness
Taliento, on cross-examination, said this:
told me I wouldn't be prosecuted.

He said nobody

Then you look at Mr.

DiPaoli's affidavit and he said if he eventually testified
as a witness for the Government at the trial of the defendant
Giglio he would not be prosecuted.
Now, you say there was no perjury in this

case

34
but those are just two statements 180 degrees apart.
MR. SACHSE:

I don't think they are as far apart

as they seem if you keep in mind —
QUESTION:
the quid pro quo.

— quid pro quo, but he already delivered
He already testified on direct examination

for the Government against Giglio.
MR. SACHSE:

No,

What I was suggesting, Your Honors,

is that in the context of his testimony he is there on trial
being cross-examined.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Yes, after his direct testimony.
He may well have understood this to

be questioning as to whether he has a deal with the Government.
There are four or five pages about whether he had a deal with
the Government.

He did not try to deny that he expected

that —
QUESTION:

Well, his words were "Nobody told me I

wouldn't be prosecuted."

Then you have an affidavit from

an Assistant United States Attorney saying that he had told
him that he wouldn't be prosecuted.
MR. SACHSE:

But he also had within the week before

his testimony the explanation from the United States Attorney
that no promise had been made and Taliento may have interpreted
whatever had been said to him 2-1/2 years before differently
than Mr. DiPaola interpreted that,
QUESTION:

The word "nobody" has a meaning in the

35

English language, doesn't it?
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And DiPaola states under oath that he

did tell him that he wouldn't be prosecuted.
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:
be prosecuted."

That is correct.

'4 .<*■

The witness says "Nobody told me I wouldn't

You can't rely on that record and say there

could be no finding of perjury here, can you?
MR. SACHSE:

It seems to me that it is less than

perjury when the witness has spent a week with the Federal
attorneys just before this testimony in which they have made
it perfectly clear to him that he could still be prosecuted
and he apparently —
QUESTION:

If he didn't testify.

But by this time,

he had testified the way the Government wanted him to, so
he delivered his part of the bargain.
MR. SACHSE:

Mr. Hoey had also apparently made it

clear to him that even if he did testify he would simply
have to rely on the good faith and judgment of the Government.
What I have in mind is that it could be that
Taliento at one time thought he had an absolute promise, but
that after this week of discussions with the Federal attorney
he would no longer think he had an absolute promise because
they told him he didn't have it.
QUESTION:

Has the conflict which Justice White

36

focused on between the affidavit of the trial assistant and
the affidavit of the man who prepared the case for trial,
DiPaola, ever been resolved by the District Court?
MR. SACHSE:

I don't think the District Court saw

it as a necessary conflict.
QUESTION:

Don't you agree that there is a conflict

as Justice White pointed out?
MR. SACHSE:

I really think there is a conflict,

that DiPaola apparently told Golden that he had made no
promise, and that in his own affidavit he says he had made a
promise.
Now, whether this means that he had forgotten it
and remembered it again, or whether it means that he is trying
to give more definiteness 2-1/2 years later than he gave at
the time of the trial to whatever statements he made —
QUESTION:

What if on a hearing before the District

Court judge now Mr. DiPaola retracted his affidavit and said
that he had never given any such assurances for whatever
reasons we need not be concerned now.

Wouldn’t that have a

lot to do with the ultimate resolution of this issue?
MR. SACHSE:

I really don’t think so, Your Honor,

because I think even if we take this case at the worst for
the Government whore you would have an absolute promise of
immunity made to the witness, no knowledge of that by the
Government lawyers at the time of the trial, the witness

37
assured that he had no immunity, the witness forgetting or
thinking that his prior grant was no longer operative and
stating that he has no immunity, though making it clear he
hopes that he has not been prosecuted, that he hopes he
wouldn't be prosecuted —
QUESTION:

I don't buy your suggestion that the

hypothetical situation I posed wouldn't alter it.

Suppose,

to be more specific, the hearing was held and DiPaola was
called and took the stand and admitted that his affidavit
submitted in this case was false and that he had made it
out of sympathy for this petitioner and out of an old friend­
ship with their family.
MR. SACHSE:
would be over.

This is purely hypothetical.
I agree in that situation the case

There would be no question at all.

QUESTION:

It wouldn't be over.

You would have

to decide at which time he was not telling the truth, wouldn't
you?
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

That is right.
You would have to make a finding on

that.
MR. SACHSE:

But what I am saying is even if DiPaola's

affidavit is accepted as absolutely true, I don't think that
there was any perjury — perhaps Justice Stewart sees this
one question as a possibility, as perhaps perjury.

I think

in the context of this witness testifying in that trial with

38

what had been told him the week before at worst it was an
incomplete answer.
QUESTION:

As a representative of the United States

Government, which one of these three statements from another
member of the United States Government should we tales?
signs it the Assistant United States Attorney.

He

He doesn't

sign as an individual.
MR. SACHSE:

I think this Court should, tinless it

wants to send the case back for an evidentiary hearing, I
think this Court should accept Mr. DiPaola’s statement as
true that -QUESTION:
MR. SACHSE:

Which one?
His affidavit as true, that he did

tell Taliento that he would not prosecute him if he testified
in tli© trial.
QUESTION:

What about his statement to Mr. Golden

that he didn’t?
MR. SACHSE:
too.

I think that should be accepted as true,

When he spoke to Mr. Golden, he didn’t tell Mr. Golden

this.
QUESTION:

One of the two times he wasn't telling

tile truth.
MR. SACHSE:
QUESTION:

He may not have told the whole truth.
Should that not be resolved by a finding

of fact explicitly by the District Court?

39
MR. SACKSE:

I can't argue strongly against a remand

for finding of fact in this case, but I do believe that even
if we take these statements at their worst against the Governraent, what we are presented with is a case where the Govern­
ment had overwhelming evidence against Mr. Giglio, a case in
which if there was any perjury at all — it is doubtful but
— I think there was no perjury — a case in which if there
was any Government misrepresentation, it was honest and not
in bad faith, a case in which the likelihood that if this
case were tried over on the merits the results would come out
any different way is almost nil.
There are two facts of the case that I haven't
talked about that I think I should mention.

First is that

be found.

He told the FBI where Giglio could

He went with the FBI and they found Giglio with

the money in his pocket, $550 in large bills, which was
approximately the amount that was to be given to Taliento.
There is no real risk that any promises of immunity
one way or the other would have affected the substance of
this testimony in chief because it was all fixed before any
of this happened.
QUESTION:

This is a harmless error argument, is

that it?
MR. SACHSE:

Yes.

The second point on that is this jury knew ■— and
this is what the District Court found and I think the District
Court opinion is a wise opinion -- this jury knew the whole
time that Taliento was the Government’s witness, that two
years had passed and that he had not bean indicted, that if
he testified properly he probably never would be indicted.
The defense lawyer spent almost his whole argument on the
fact that Taliento was a biased witness.

There is nothing

that would be added by the fact that the Government had at
one time promised immunity and then taken that promise back.
QUESTION:

Something would have been subtracted

if the United States Attorney had not put in his argument
that statement.
MR. SACHSE:

That is true, that is true, but whether

41
that — tills was argument and — this was not evidence/ but
argument.
QUESTION:

What other testimony was in the record

that tied Giglio to all of this other than that one witness?
MR. SACHSEs

Other than Taliento, the fact that

the FBI went out and found Giglio where he was supposed to be,
found him with this money in his pocket, and that Giglio
presented no defense at all, introduced no witnesses, did not
take the stand himself.
QUESTION:
entrapment.

There is some suggestion here about

What evidence as distinguished from argument was

introduced of entrapment?
MR. SACHSE:
Your Honor.

There is no evidence of entrapment,

No evidence at all.

QUESTION:

Was it just argument to the jury?

MR. SACHSE:

It was just a wholly unfounded argument

that Taliento, to get himself off the hook, would try to bring
Giqlio in.

There is no evidence of that.

There is no reason,

just reading what happened, to suspect that.
all the other way around.
up.

The evidence is

It was Giglio's idea.

He set it

It wasn't a very bright idea and they got caught.

Then

Taliento, instead of being a good solid crook and keeping it
all to himself, talked.
The problem with a retrial in this case, if it
ever came to that, is that Taliento was a reluctant witness

42
to begin with and he testified and there is no evidence that
he testified any way other than truthfully,,

The thing that

would be bad is if somehow the pressure got to him and he
wouldn’t testify again*

Instead of being able to get testimony

that did correspond with the statements he made when it was
at a time, at an auspicious time, we have testimony that
would be altered to now try to help his friend Giglio.
QUESTION:

What is there to prevent him being

confronted with his testimony as a hostile witness if what
you suggest developed?
MR. SACRSE:
done, yes.

Unless he disappeared, that could be

Unless he disappeared.

But I think the crus: of

the case — and I will say this and sit down unless there
is some further question ■— is that the jury knew this was
the Government's witness.

They knew everything they could

know to know that the Government still had a weight hanging
over his head.

If the Government had no weight handing over

his head he would have been a freer witness than he was as
things turned out.
Further, his testimony was within what can be
expected of a co-conspirator in a criminal trial on his
testimony as to what he had been promised and what he had not
been promised.

There is simply nothing in this case that

raises it to the level of cases like Brady v. Maryland and
Mathew v. Illinois, where there was

real evidence that

might have changed the outcome of his case and where a
prosecutor had suppressed it or where there was no perjury
that he didn’t correct.

This is a kind of case that I believe

in which the District Court and the Court of Appeals should
have a certain amount of discretion and in which this Court
should be reluctant to undo what both the District Court and
the Court of Appeals# who to some extent were closer to the
case, have both found was correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you# Mr. LaRossa.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon# at 11:00 o'clock# a.m„# the arguments
in the above-entitled matter were concluded.)
