MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

We*11 hear arguments next

in No. 47, Diffenderfer against Central Baptist Church.
Mr. Pfeffer,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFPER, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF APPELLANT DXFFENDERFSR
MR, PFEFFERs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
This case presents the question, whether the First
and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution forbid govern­
ment tax exemption to extend to church-owned commercial
property?
The specifics of the case involve a Florida statute —
Q

Excuse me, Mr. Pfoffer,

begin, the Attorney

General

I wonder, before you

of Florida has filed a suggestion

which, as I read it, says that this exemption is no longer
available under Florida law and the issue to which I wish you
would particularly address yourself, says that under Florida
law this particular property is a reversal and cannot be
subjected to tax; is that right?
MR. PFEFFSRs

Yes.

Hot quite.

The —I have

addressed myself to the question of mootness in my reply
brief which X have filed with this Courty specifically to that
occlusive issue.
ease is not moot.

But 1 will briefly state why I believe the

4

In the first case,, -the new amendatory law is not yet
in effect.

It takes effect next year, December 3Xst of this

year, which means the next fiscal year.

So that the taxes

this year, at the very least, is before the Coart, so that it’s
not moot.
Q

Let me sea now,.

You man even if the tax

if

we were to reverse and the tax for the past year is not
collectable, you cay it is collectable for -MR. PFEFFER:

For this year, because the statute

itself, at the very last, says it shall not take effect until
next year.

You'll find that and the suggestion — you’ll find

that on the very last page, 15, of the suggestion of the
attorney General of the State of Florida, which has a text of
the amendatory statute.
Actually it will take effect December 31st, 1971,
which means the next year, not for the current one.
So that, at the very minimum, it’s applicable.
There is also a Florida statute which says that if
any tax which is not collected for any reason, is thereafter
determined to be payable, the taxpayer is liable for the
years past.
So that on the very technical —

Q

Well, that’s the one that concerned me.

I

thought tt 20 Stats was suggesting that there was no such —
MR. PPEFPBRs

Yes, there is.

Xt is contained in my

reply brief.
Q

Well, perhaps 2 should ask your adversary, then.

I won't take any more of your time.
MR. PFEFFER: And the statute does so provide.
Q

I take it, you would concede if there were no

tax collectable, in the event you prevail, then this case would
be moot, wouldn't it?

MR. PFEFFERs
reason.

Well, 2 don’t think so, for a different

1 think that under the decision of this Court, in

Plasfc v. Cohen, a determination that the plaintiffs here, as the
taxpayer, has standing to sue, means that they have been
individually harmed by the exemption? and while the State of
Florida can, if it wishes to, provide that in the future there
shall foe exemption, at least as far as the tax which has
accrued, while this suit is pending, at the very least — the
very least —- the plaintiff, by his factor, he has standing,
has been personally aggrieved.
Q

Even though the tax is never collectable?

MR. PFEFFER:

Oh, well, the tax may be collectable,

presumably, within the power of tills Court as a court of equity.
Q

Ho, no

MR. PFEFFER 3 What do you mean?
q

my hypothesis only was:

would this case be

moot if in fact you prevail, anet the property were taxable,
nev-ortheloss, the tax is not collectable under Florida law?

e,
MR. PPEPPERs

Well, I would say that under the First

Amendment the plaintiffs here would have a suit in the court
to compel this payment of tastes as a redress for a wrong
already committed.
Q

I see.

MR. PFEFFER:

An equitable part of the cau.se.

In any ©vent, the issue — it is collectable, as I
indicated, and the issue is one of national importancet else
the Court would not have noted if.
Q

Well, as you know, Mr. Ffeffer, I’m sure, Florida

has a rule that sometimes I wish many other States had —
MR. PFEFFERs
Q

Yes.

— which permits us to submit the State law

questions to the Florida Supreme Court before we decide a
constitutional question.
MR. PFEFFER2

We've den® that once or twice, ~~
Yes.

Yes.

a

Q

“-in the Aldrioh case among others.

MR. PFEFFERt
Q

Yes.

Y6u don’t think this might b© an appropriate

case for that —
MR. PFEFFERs

I don’t think it’s necessary, because

the amendatory statute is unambiguous ? it says it will not
take effect until next year.

So, to that extent, X don’t

think you should.
Q

You said you don't think it’s necessary.

Do you

7
think it would be an appropriate case?
MR, PFEPFER:

Mo, Mr. Chief Justice, X don’t think so.

Because X think if the Florida Court , as X indicated in my
brief, if the Florida Court would say that the tax is not
collectable retroactively, X would say that still raises a
federal issue, a federal question, whether the State of Florida
can deprive a taxpayer of that

equitable remedy any more than

it could deprive him of the right

just to originate.

It’s a

federal question, not a'State question.
Now, the question, to the specifics of this case, is
a Florida statute which, as I pointed out, has been amended.
Now, there is a difference between myself and the attorney for
the other plaintiff.

Wo do not challenge the constitutionality

of the amendatory statute.
The amendatory statute says:

when a piece of

property owned by a church is used partly for church purposes ,
and partly for

>commercial purposes, that part which is used,

there shall be a pro rata tax on that part which is used for
non — or the extent it's used for commercial purposes.
Mr. Hollander, representing the plaintiff Paul, is
of the opinion that any use of it destroys the entire exemption.
We do not go that far.

We concede, at least for the purpose

of this case, that to the extent that the statute prorates the
taxability, to that extent it is constitutional.
Now, the question presented to this Court is whether

8
this Court’s decision in Wals, which upheld the exemptability
of property owned by a church and used exclusively for
religious purposes, extends to property which is used for —•
at least in part, purely in the secular field of commercial
competition and enterprise, the sole relationship to the church
being that all the profits of it go to the church.
It is our contention that nothing in the Wala case
requires its extension to this particular case r and the issue
is specifically not before -the Court.
In Wals, the Court recognised and rejected the
argument there presented that tax exemptions represented the
first, step in an inevitable progression.

The Court Saids

the history of tax exemption for 200 years shows there has not.
been an inevitable progression in breaking down the wall of
f

separation between church and State.
,

/

i

If Your Honor please, this case shows that perhaps
tha Court woe a little too optimistic in Wals, because this is

a. further step.

Unlike the Wale situation, this does not have

tha support of 200’ years of uniform, universal practice upon
which the Court, both the Court’s opinion and concurring opinion,
relies in large measure on Wals.

It shows that ever sine®

our Constitution was written, in every State of the', Union,
including the Federal Government, land vised exclusively for
Religious purposes was exempt.
And tha Court pointed out, the concurring opinion

9
pointed cut, that this history is worth volumes of logic and
should be of great weight*
The history here is just the reverse.

The history

here shows, as I've pointed out in my brief, that even as far
back as 1217 there was this device of turning over property to
— religiously owned property for non-religious use as a
moans of avoiding the obligations of feudalism and what today
would foe;

functional equivalent of taxation.
JSaw, it is our contention that a statuta which

exempts a church from those burdens which every sector of
commercial institutions bears in its operation in the commercial
area, is inevitably a statute whose purpose, or certainly its
effect, whatever its purpose, its primary effect is the
advancement of religion.

To that extent it is subject to the

restrictions of the First Amendment.
Now, in Wals, the Court noted, aside from the hiatorical background of tax exemption, that the State was faced with
an alternative harss

tax the church, in which case there will

have to be some entanglement of the State in church affairs?
or do not tax it, in which case the entanglement, if any,
will ba considerably less.
And the rationale of the Court, as I see it, the
rationale of the opinion as I see it, is this*

that prima

facia, at the very least, a statute by the State which advances
religion or aids religion is prima faci® subject to constitu-

10
tional, at least, scrutiny, strong scrutiny.

And it's only

if you can show, as was asserted in Walz, that there is a
countervailing factors that to tax would impose another evil,
which the First Amendment sought to avoid, the evil of
entanglement, then.we;will allow the exemption rather than
invoke the entanglement.
How, in the cases decided since we wrote the brief
in this case, the Lemon, and DiCenso, and the Tilton cases,
the Court found that the Wals case did not intend, and it did
not expand the scope of government©!, of permissible govern­
mental aid to religion, but restricted? and the Court noted,
particularly in Tilton, which involved the college aid, and
the Court, held that that part of the federal law which said
that after 20 years a college which receives part fund® to
build a facility may use it for any purpose.

That part of it

the Court unanimously •— there was no Court's opinion in
Tilton, there was a plurality.
But there the Justices agreed that to that extent,
at least, that statute was unconstitutional.

There was some

value which existed after 20 years, and the State could not,
or the Federal Government could not aid or advance religion
to that extent.
Even though -- even though it would mean continuing
surveillance and entanglement after the 20 years.

Because the

statute, Higher Education Facilities statute, forbade the use

XI
of those facilities financed with federal funds to be for
sectarian teaching or religious worship.

So that the government

agency, after ?0 years, would still have to keep an eye on that
facility, to make sure it was not used for religion.
Thus quite clearly indicating, although there seems
to be an impression, which I do not believe is valid, that
the Everson rule had been buried, dead and buried, and that the
government may aid religion? 1 don’t know of any case that
so holds.

But it’s quite clear that Tilton and Lemon* -DiCenso

do not allow a government aid to religion absent some counter­
vailing factor, such as in Wals, entanglement in Everson, the
welfare of children who were protected from the accidents of
the haaards of the road, and that type of case.
Now, our contention here is that the amount of
entanglement involved in financing the commercial activities
of a religious group is minimum, and that it is far outweighed
by the other factors which call for constitutional restriction
upon that aid or benefit to religion.
One of the things which we believe should be
considered by the Court, and which the Court noted, both in
Wals and in Lemon and DlCenso, that one of the things, one of
the major evils the First .amendment was aimed at avoiding
was what the Court called the potential for political divisiveness along religious lines?

divisive political potential.

That the fathers of our — the First Amendment were

12
afraid, and they had a whole history of 2,000 years of
political .

control

and d&visiveness because of religion,

churches seeking certain benefits, and the church in return
seeking to control the — the State in turn seeking to control
tha church.
We contend that this type of legislation, which puts
a competitive advantage in the business world in favor of
churches, necessarily brings that type of divisive political
potential which this Court warned against, both in Wala and
repeated it in Lemon and DlCanao.

The acrimony, the bitterness,

the feelings of a garage plot owner across the street in
downtown Minneapolis, from that owned by the church, that the
church doesn't have to pay a tax and therefore can undercut
him, whereas he has to pay taxes.
That kind ©£ political d^viaiveneas, that kind of
reaction towards favoritism to the church is on© of the dangers
which 1 believe the First hns&ndment was intended to avoid.

S?ow “»

Well, a municipality could easily control that

competitive aspect, could it not, by prescribing rates?

Xs

the competitive factor really very important?
ME. PFEFFERs

Oh, yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice,

because the municipality — the State — the municipality

belong© to the Stata — the State could avoid it by simply
talcing..it.

The point is that it doesn’t.

It’s not that it

13
has the power to, the point is that if it has the power to it
would simply —* nobody contends, Mr. Chief Justice, that the
State could not impose such a tax.
Q

I just thought you were resting too much on

the competitive faetor, when the municipality could govern
that by firing all the rates for all the parking lots, so that
one could not undercut the other.
MR. PFEFFER:

But, as I have indicated, Mr. Chief

Justice, if the State does not want to give an unfair
advantage to the church, they could do it, or rescind it by
simply not making it tax-exempt, by simply not — by not
making it tax-exempt.

Which 1 do not believe that the appellees

here contend that there is a constitutional right to tax
exemption.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We*!! suspend for lunch.

(Whereupon, at 12s00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at Is00 p.m., the same day.)

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD J. HOLLANDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT PAUL
MR. HOLLANDER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The case is, of course, one involving separation of
church and State, and is in fact a progression of the Walz
decision decided last year by this Court.
I do not premise my thinking on this case on the
■Everson decision.

I believe that my position am he squarely

met in the dictates of not only Walz, but the three cases
decided this year, DiCenao, Tilton, and Lemon.
This Court has said, in those three cases, as well as
Wala, that there are three main evils

which the establishment

clause attempted to prevent, and that was;

financial aid,

sponsorship and active involvement.
And we measured those three evils by three tests,

15
we are told.

The tests ares

whether or not there's a valid

secular legislative purpose? the second was a test decided in
Schemppi which is whether or not the primary effect either

inhibits or advances religion? and the third test is whether or
not there is excessive entanglement or active involvement.
2 think that the case before Your Honors is clearly
one not involving a valid secular legislative purpose as seen
in the ’tfoi-s decision, where there was discussion in the Court
opinion concerning the pluralism of religions and the good
works of religions.

Certainly that's not involved, where we

have a commercial parking lot.

And that, incidentally, is

exactly what it is,
We * re involved with a square block in the City of
Miami, which occupies 127,500 square feet, of which 75,000
square feet is this commercial parking lot.

Monday through

f-y .urday —- this is all stipulation of facts, because it's

not contested? we"re up here on stipulation of facts — Monday
lb-cough Saturday, each and. every day other t&an Sunday, this
religious institution rants out this lot other than those
particular lots within the 230 which are used for persons who
might want to attend church that day for a choir meeting or
a directors meeting of some kind.

Other than the portion

which might be used for someone who might have some business
Monday through Saturday in the church, the entire rest of this
lot, 73,000 square feet, 290 parking spaces, is rented out

commercially, six days out of seven days a week.

This is

stipulation of facts.
Q

What do you mean rent it out commercially; is

there an operator on it?
MR. HOLLANDER?

0hf yes.

Drive your car in, you pay

your toll and go out.
Q

You mean this is operated as a regular parking lot?

MR. ■ HOLLANDERs Right.

You don't know that it’s

necessarily owned even by a church, it just sits — it’s just
a regular parking lot for anyone who doesn't have business in
the church.
Q

Are these church employees who are the

attendant?
MR. HOLLANDERS

lire they church employees?

really don’t know that, sir.
Q

l

I don't know.

The church hasn't leased the lot to a parking

lot operator who runs it as a parking lot?

It's directly by

the church, is that it?
MR. HOLLANDERS

X really can’t tell you that, sir.
\

I don’t know whether or not they lease it.

2 know that the

lots are used commercially six days out of seven days a week?
1 don’t know if there's anyone else that intervenes between the
church and perhaps the —
Q
all?

The stipulation of facts doesn't cover that at

1?
MR. HOLLANDERs
Honor.

X don't think it covers that, Your

But X don't really think that gets at the issue.

The issue is whether or not, in my judgment, the primary fact
of ranting out Monday through Saturday 290 spaces, or almost
all of that, or the active involvement of the government is
such as to transgress the restrictions of the establishment
clause.

1 think that is really the issue involved, and I don't
think whether or not the institution itself, or a corporation
which the institution has contracted with, actually runs the
lot.
Q

What would you say if the church just made the

lot available to the general public during the week, at no
cost?
MR. HOLLANDERS

I think it's constitutional.

I

think it’s constitutional.
Q

That would he a non-religious purpose.

MR. HOLLANDERS
not the case.

Q

X think so, but this lot is — that's

The stipulation of facta, of course, is —■
Wall, where are the stipulations with respect,

to this aspect of the rental?

Are there hare in the Appendix

somewhere?
MR. HOLLANDER*
They are —
Q

Yes.

The Appendix was dispensed with.

MR. HOLLANDERs

as part of the record, and they

are quoted, incidentally, at length in the appellees8 brief.
Q

Yes,

(Mr, Hollander leafing through pages.)
Q
time.

Well, I don51 want to take any more of your

I can find it if they're in the appellees' brief,
MR. HOLLANDERs

They are

well, it’s certainly a

stipulation of facts which all parties entered into.
Q

I understand that.

MR. HOLLANDERS And 1 don't — 2 don't think that those
facts are at all in issue.
2 do think that we have some vary important things to
decide, and that is, certainly the valid secular legislative,'
purpose is not there.

Then we come to the primary effect.

And I noted, the language in Tilton.

1 think that's

extremely important, because Tilton was decided on the basis
that the buildings were strictly secular.

There were no

religious symbols; there was no permeation of religion in
higher institutions.

It was strictly secular use.

So the Court was concerned with the use of these
facilities.

Well, what’s the use of this facility?

Six

days out of seven clays each week they rent out this parking
■ i

lot, an

a

they take in a profit? they're at a competitive

advantage because they don't pay taxes.
So if the use of the property is to be any kind of

19
criteria , as apparently it was in the Tilton decision tchsre the
buildings were strictly secular, and the Court dwelled on that
fact, then certainly the use of this property commercially
would, cast it within the terms of the establishment clause.
And certainly also within the terms of what this Court dis~
cussed in the Tilton decision.
X also think that the entanglement that we gat
involved in, which this Court discussed in the three decisions
this year, and the Wala decision last year, is present in this
case.
The kind of political divisiveness, which this Court
s&ys is not inherent

in our people, is certainly involved in

this case.
After all, we have a Circuit Court that attempted
to tax, we have a Supremo Court of Florida that got outraged
at the Circuit Court and reversed? we have a Legislature that
says, We don't like the Supreme Court's decision at ail?
threw out the statutes, and said that next year we'll go into
new statutes.

We have a raging controversy in Florida over

this lot, and a very political divisiveness which this Court
seeks to prevent is exactly what we have with the commercial
parking lot in Miami,

Row, is it a commercial parking lot, or is it
something else?

The District Court down there said it was a

commercial parking lot*

They held as follows?

20

"Does the holding in Wals vs. Sax Commissioner, supra,
that there is no establishment of religion and no inhibition
of the free exercise of religion in a state taxation scheme
which exempts from taxation property used ’exclusively for
religious purposes', i.e., 'religious properties used solely
fox* religious worship* — encompass the tax exemption in the
instant case as it applies to church property, used as a
commercial parking lot?

We answer affirmatively.”

So they concluded it's a commercial parking lot*
But why have they decided it’s okay,- a novel constitutional
i

principle?

They said, because the proceeds go to a worthwhile

charitable recipient, based on Walts, and the court based their
decision on Waistj and the recipient, we're going to hold that
it’s perfectly all right because there's a worthwhile recipient,
even though we hold it a commercial parking lot.
X think that’s a novel ruling, because I've never
Been any., establishment case, really, that looked at whether
or not the worthwhile recipient was such as to permit it
within the establishment clause.

And, incidentally, the very

kind of entanglement is inherent in that kind of decision.
After allf the sight of government auditors, govern­
ment inspectors, in daily surveillance, running through church
records each day to determine where the funds were traced to,
was it or not a worthwhile recipient?

That is the very kind,

X understand it, of surveillance which this Court says is

21
not proper under the establishment clause.
So the very decision of the U. 3. District Court
calls for the kind of surveillance which is "trace the funds,
and if it’s worthwhile, fine? if it's not worthwhile, then we
do something about it.65
How, 1 think, along these very same lines, and
counsel and I may have a difference here — I think we do —
the new statute which is going to go into effect next year
is even worse than this one, because the new statute says, —
well, we're going to break it off at 50 percent, and if it's
less than 50 percent we will prorate it, you see.
So the government auditors or inspectors, in their
daily policing, will go through the records of the church of
these 290 spaces, and will says

You used this apace Monday,

Wednesday, and Friday for commercial purposes? you used this
space Tuesday and Thursday for religious purposes.

And they

will have to go through how many spaces were used for religious
purposes, how many for commercial purposes, and the very
surveillance, the very abhorrent kind of degrading situation,
not only for the government but for the religious institution,
is inherent in the new formula.

It doesn't cure it, it makes

it worse? the new statute.
Q

Well, on this issue, I gather, you and your

fellow counsel, your fellow appellant, are are odds; am 1 right?
MR„ HOLLANDERz We are at odds.

X think that the new

22
statute is even worse than the old statute, because I think
it calls for greater entanglement even than the old one does.
Q

As I understand his position, he told us that

he doesn’t think the new statute produces an unconstitutional
situation.
MR. HOLLANDERS

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

W© are at odds

on that point.
Q

flight,

MR, HOLLANDER*

Now, 1 want to preface my remarks

in that regard.
Q

1 understand.

HR* HOLLANDER%

Right.

I wanted to direct the remainder of

my remarks to the mootness issue, because I think it8s specious
in all respect.

St’s specious for several reasons•

First of all, let's get to the back-taxing.
y is specifically permitted in Florida.

Back-

It is specifically

permitted by Florida Statute 193,052, and the two cases cited
by aooellees, which is the City of Naples case and the Blount
case, stand for the proposition that back-taxing is permitted.
In fact, the two cases say so.
Q

Mr. Hollander, do you think this Court has the

authority to tell the State of Florida that they must collect
the back taxes?
MR. HOLLANDERs

Yes, sir? 1 think it does, because

I think it's a matter of —

£3
Q

Under what authority?

MR, HOLLANDER? Under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, which tells us that the establishment of religion
is prohibited and that —
Q

Well, for hew many years back?

MR, HOLLANDER t

It’s permitted for three years under

the statute.
Q

Well, why couldn’t we ««> we’re not bound toy that

according to your opinion? we could, go back 20, couldn’t we?
MR. HOLLANDERr. Well, perhaps so,
Just hov? far do you go?

q

MR. HOLLANDERS Well, at least the statute permits
three years.

In fact, Your Honor, the case says — and these

are the very cases cited by the appellees in this point -—
the case says s

Although back assessments are specifically

authorised by Florida statute -—
q

Mandamus?

Well, specifically', what vehicle would that be?

An order?

Or what?

MR. HOLLANDERS

We 13., I don’t — I can’t tell the

Court what procedure to use.
0

I simply think that —■

Well, tell ms, who has authority to levy the

taxes in Florida?
MR. HOLLANDER: The county authority, the taxing
authority in Dads County.
Q

Are they a party here?

Dade County is a defendant,,

MR. HOLLANDER:

who collects there?

is he a party?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES M. WHELAN, ESQ,,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. WHELAN*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it -pleases

the Courts
The tax exemption that is involved in this case is
possibly singular in the' history of American tax law.
certainly extinct.

The statute has been changed.

But it's

This

particular tax exemption will not be available after the end
of this year, and this year’s tax year is already closed,
Q

What are your tax years?

MR. WHELANt
Q

Well, it begins in January arid by the —

Calendar year.

MR. WHELAN:

«*- first Monday in October, the rolls are

finished and nothing more can bo done, except —
Q

That is for the year 1371?

MR. WHELANs

That's correct.

Q

I see.

Q

Is that in the record, that October date?

MR. WHELANi

No, but it’s in the statute that

governs the assessments.
0

Well, is it clear that property inadvertently

omitted, or omitted for any reason at all, could not be placed
or after the October date?
MR. WHELANs

Ho, under Florida law, where there has

been simple inadvertence, or even positive neglect, back-taxes

can be assessed for a period, of three years

That’s clear from

the terms of the statute, and from the construction of that
statutet in City of Naples v, Conboy.
However,

where the taxing authority has positively

and affirmatively treated the property as exempt, as it has in
this case, since the decision of the Suprema Court of Florida,
then the taxing authority cannot change its position after the
rolls have been endorsed on the first Monday of October.

If it’s listed by the assessing authorities as

establish an estoppel-against the taxing authorities subsequently

MR. WHELANj

Q

'■ I see»

MR. WHELANs

c:.-

That is correct, Your Honor.

Mow, it is true that in the City of Naples

that the Florida Supreme Court allowed the taxpayers, who

v .v.'.g t?.o plaintiffs in that suit and were trying to compel the
City of .daplse to disregard the contract that it entered into

30
for an exemption for real estate development, it is true that
the Supreme Court of Florida said that while the city could
not be compelled to collect taxes for the three years prior
to the commencement of a litigation, that they could collect
taxes for the years during which the litigation proceeded.
So, insofar as the plaintiffs make the contention
that at least the current year’s tax is still at issue, at
least that much, because a court order could change the rolls?
my answer to that is that the doctrine of equitable estoppel.
as it has been applied in the Cop-pack case and the Cl tv of Naples
case, would clearly result in a decision by the Supreme Court
c£ Florida that, the tax commissioners here cannot change their

MR. HHBLANt
Q

Yes, 'four Honor.

Go we can write that out of the case, in your

view?
MR. WHELANj

Yes,

However, if the statute, the old

statute were still on the books, then it would seem to me that
the ~~ at least the question of the old statute would still be
around? but it’s not around.

And if the plaintiff — if the

appalXante are correct,which X do not concede, if they arc
correct in saying that Florida is really out on the line of
American tax tradition, you know, with this type of statute,
•w id that it goes irv the teeth of the whole history of AngloAmerican tax law, then clearly this case becomes totally
insignificant.

The statute no longer exists.

And if they’re

correct, Florida is the only, or almost the only jurisdiction
that has ever permitted this sort of thing, so there is no
significance to this case whatsoever.
However, the real issue in this case is not the issue
that the appellants have presented.

Arid the reason it isn’t

the issue that they have presented is that they have attempted
to put a label of commercial business on an activity of the
church which, while it has certain commercial dimensions, is

32
of a much more limited character and one recognised by all
American jurisdictions as being something that is different
from pure commercial activity.
Now, in the stipulation of facts, which is contained —
which is reprinted as an appendix to the motion to dismiss or
affirm, we have the following stipulated facts between the
parties.

On page 3 of the Appendix, stipulation that —
Q

Where’s the Appendix?

MR, WHELANs
Q

It’s in the Motion to Dismiss or Affirm,

Yes, I*vo got its thank you.

MR, WHELANs

Page 3?

On page 3, wo have a stipulation that

all of this church property is being used for church purposes„
On page 4, a stipulation of the use o£ part of the
parking area during the week by church members*
On page 5, particularly, we have a key stipulation*
In the paragraph at the top of that pages

that the church is

r

located in the heart of a great metropolitan area, and is
required to maintain the parking area for the use of the
congregation, and so forth.
Then, part of this parking space — this is in the
middle — is used every day of the week by people attending
church and church functions*

But rather than to permit that

portion not to used to lie vacant, the church rents the parking
area.

The church does directly operate this parking area.

There is no intervening lessor.

33
Q

Wall t tell rae, under the net'? statute ~~ you

knot?, that statute is not before us —~ notwithstanding all
this, the church is going to have to pay some part of the
taxes, some taxes'?
MR. VfHELMl:

That may be so, Your Honor.

Zfc

depends on the regulations that will be promulgated in
■interpreting that SO percent —
Q

Well, of course, it has to bo 50 percent or

something like that?
MR. WHELMS?

Yes.

Depending on what the church itself does, depending
on what the regulations say the church does —
Q

Wall, I was just wondering if —« it says so

flatly that this is an absolute essential to the church service
whether the new statute as applied to this may not render it
total.
MR. WHETJSH:

sill' have

Well, yes, there are questions that

to be answered about the new statute? that is clear,
Q

I take it you concede that Florida could

eliminate exemptions altogether?
MR. Mi ELM? s
Q

Yes, it could. Your Honor.

And now you suggest that this now statute just

gives a partial exemption to —
MR. WHELANs

That is certainly its intention.

Its

intention is to say that from now on we*re not going to follow

34
the 75 parcsnt rale,

Florida had tha statute, as is set out

in tha brief, where any charitable, non-profit organisation
could rent out up to 75 percent of its home facility, the basic
facilities necessary for the operations, the exempt operations
of that organisation» and it could take the rental and use the
rental income for esew.pt purposes,

Florida has now said, "We’re not going to do that
my mere,”

2£ you don’t use at least 50 percent of the

facility for exempt purposes, then you have to pay 100 pereant
of the ta&.

If you use mere than 50 percent, than we will

apportion the tax according to the amount of the property that
is used for non-exempt purposes.
So in this particular case the application that will
actually be made of a new statute to the parking lot will depend
on how that 50 percent is figured, and on what use the church
makes next year*

January 1st Is the status date in Florida,

so the me that’s made of that church parking area on January
1st will determine the —« he one of the principal determinanto
of the application of the now statute.

Q

Well, under that statute, would it be possible

for the church to just lay out tha square footage and carve off,
to be safe, 49 parcent of it and rant the 49 percent out?
MR.

WELPM s

Then it would have to pay tax on 49

percent,

Q

And it would reserve the others for church

purposes during the weak as well as on Sunday?
MR, WHSLAMs

But the State may taka the position that

the area to be measured is strictly the parking area, and not
all of the property owned, and that if more than 51 percent
of the parking area is rented, then the taxes have to be paid
on the entire parking area.
And we just don’t know what position the county
commissioners and the State will take on that question.
Q

But if they took the parking area and the church

reserved ’JX percent for all times during the week for its
church, under the new statute what happens?
MR. WHELAN;

They would have to pay tax on the

42* percent that they rent out.

Q

Is it licensed, the parking lot?

MR. WHELAN*

It doesn’t require a license, according

to my information. Your Honor.
Now, finally, there's a stipulation on page 12 of the
.Appendix, that this parking lot is as necessary to the church
as the roof»

So there can be no question but that in this

ca:".-: ra are talking about an income,incidental income-producing

mo oil a facility that is absolutely indispensable to the
oor/iuct of the exempt operations, and functions of this church.
ibid that’s why the issue in this case, simply cannot
be the issue that the appellants have- attempted to raise, the
broad issue of hew far the First and Fourteenth Amendments

3S
would prevent mistakes of the Federal Government, from granting
an exemption, wipe the exemption that used to exist in th©
internal Revenue Cede before the Tax Reform Act of 1969»
That exemption, the exemption of churches and certain other
types of exempt organizations, from th© tax on unrelated
business income is the exemption that appellants seem to be
attacking, but that exemption doesn't exist, either, except
to the extent that there is a typo of five-year clause in
which th© organisations that used to enjoy that exemption
before 1SS9 are given a grace period in which to dispose of the
property or start paying th© full tax.
Q

•

Mr. Whelan, how long has the parking lot been

there?
MR. WHELANs

Well, the parking lot was originally not

a part of the church* it was purchased mostly after the Second
World War* to make it possible for th© people to get to church.
As that area developed commercially and, you know, became quite
congested with automobiles, when they became available again,
after th© War -and gasoline was then available, then it was
*

necessary to secure this property; otherwise
0

1

was just thinking, you said it was as

indi f;p©jfi&:abl© as the roof.

I know some churches without

park lag lots; but X don't know of one without a roof.
MR* TSHELANWell, in this particular case ~~

Q

X

wondered, if you were pushing it a little far.

Mi, WHSLMJs

fell, X have not pushed it beyond what

appellante have stipulated —

Q

Yes,

ME* WHELAN?

— and what the Supreme Court of Florida

found*
Q

That’s right.

MB. WHELAN;

And what tha District Court in this case

also assumed.
Sor as X say, the question her® is simply not the
question of the constitutionality of an exemption that would be
granted to some totally commercial operation of a church.
The real issues in this case# as we see them# are# rather# the
permi-scibility of parity of treatment by the States and the
. •' "'.oral Government ox churches with charitable, non-profit
organizations.
That's the only question that’s before this Court#
because Florida did not give any special treatment to churches
in this case.

Florida treated churches the same way that it

treated charitable non-profit organizations in general.

There

is nothing specific# -there3s no preference here in favor of a
church# Florida treated the church in the same method just as
New York# in the Wals case, treated churches# the same w&v it
*a«;<ur.rx«2V9Ga

*“

tmterl other types of exempt organisations.
r&at apnollants are really asking this Court to say
Lr- t.b.:-.t

have to be singled out# they have to be

singled out and taxed? they cannot be included in this general
class of charitable non-profit organizations.
Q

Tell mi, suppose the church were ton miles from

this parking lot,

And the parking lot was because the church

need to' supplement its income* at th© least, as a cowaorcial
parking lot seven days a week, and the evidence was that that
income was absolutely essential to the church or it would
have to close down.

Under Florida law, would this parking lot

be exempt?

ME# WHELAN%
Q

No, it would not#

Suppose it were owned by a charitable corpora­

tion, would it then —
ME, KHELAN:

No, it would not be exempt.

It6a got to

fee useki at least 25 percent , or had to bo used at least 25 per-

cent of fcha tine as part of the home facility#

So if it5®

completely separate, and itis not used for the exempt purposes,

it simply is not exempt#
Now, I would draw the attention of th® Court to the
typical structura of an American charitable, non-profit organiza­
tion#

Think of any’,college or university, or any hospital, any

orphanage, ' of good size, most of these organisations have, in
addition to th® basic facilities that they are using, other
facilities which are also important and necessary, but which are
open to the public, in many cases, and for which a charge is

39
hospital cafeteria, the hospital parking lot,
the auditorium in a college? it’s never been a rule of American
tax law that the- only way a charitable f non-profit organisation
or a church can support itself is by frea-rule offerings that
are sufficient every year for its budget.
Every church in every State in the Unionr and hare
in the District of Columbia, churches and non-profit, charitable
organisations have been allowed to engage in fund-raising
activities of various types of a more or less commercial
character, without losing the property tax exemption.
fie*/, Florida, it is true, has adopted a rule that
is somewhat different,

la most States, so far as I have been

able to discover, if the property is rented, that is the end
of the matter.

But Florida permitted, for a time, 75 percent

rental without loss of the property tax exemption.
But there isn't any constitutional difference between
this kind of permission for use, income-producing use of the
basic home facility and the permission that has been granted
for such matters as dances end dinners and picnics and bazaars
of all kinds.

The rule has bean, in every American jurisdiction,
that the exempt organisation has to be non-profit, it has never
been that they have to be non-productive.

he

That they have to

a,.:'p lately dependent upon the free-rule offerings of the

public ro a method of financing themselves»

40
Slow, there have been,- in oar history, certain efforts
now and then to change this rule, and to require, particularly
the churches, to he dependent on frea-rule offerings made each
year and only on those offerings.

But no jurisdiction

has ever adopted the particular rule of law.
In this morning*» paper we read of the Johnson
Foundation, where a billion dollars has bean donated for the
charitable purposes off that foundation»

And this initial

gift will be administered by the foundation, in conformity with
the law, and the income from that capital gift will finance
many of the activities of the foundation.
Our law permits the creation of such activities and
entities, and has always done so.
X think that there is still another matter which is
of extreme importance in this case, and that is the attack by
ifca appellante on the doctrine of legislative discretion in
tho tax area,

This doctrine has been expressed by this Qtatrt

on :v\:.v occasions, notably in the Bellas Gap Railroad, v.
-cansylvania case, and it was also in Gibbons v. District of
-v-'vli

Columbia case.

It was also mentioned in the Wals cans.

That the Legislature isn*t frosen into every particle of the
tax laws.

There is ample opportunity for the exercise of

choice.
The Constitution set soma limits.

There are specific

limitations in the Constitution off the United States in the

4.1
taxing power» both of Congress and of the States,

But it the

absence of a specific prohibition* clear prohibition* this
Court has been*correctly, totally reluctant to imply limitations
on the exercise of the taxing powers.

Q
answer*

Mr. Whelan* I'm just curious* 2 think I know the

Does the church have any federal income tax complica­

tions with respect to this parking lot?

Is the income taxable,

42
Federal income tax —
MR. WHELANs

No, it is not, Your Honor, because the

definition of an unrelated-business excludes rentals.
Q

Churches.

MR, WHELANx
Q

Excludes rentals?

MR. WHELAN*
Q

Rentals? correct.

At any' time has it aver paid Federal income tax?

MR. WHELANs
Q

Not churches any more.

No, Your Honor.

And there is no State, no Florida State income

tax, or at least hasn't been for a while?
MR. WHELANs

Not that I know of*

So the rental problem, and, say, the unrelated business
income problem hare is that the

- or the answer to it is simply

that the Federal statuta excludas from the definition of an
unrelated business income derived from interest, from dividends,
from rentals, and from royalties.
But lot's Consider for a moment the choice that the
'

3

. :vbo fac; a in this

only two choices t

area of taxation

one, to tax? and

Appellants assert

and
the

?

exemption*

other,

not

that not taxing helps.

correct in that contention, despite

It

‘to

tax*

If they're

the language of the Wale

cmo, which rejects that concept,

that an exemption involves

sponsorship or active assistance,

that if they are correct in

saying that an

exemption helps, then it stands to reason that

taxation hurts.
In the doctrine of the Bversoa case, and of the
subsequent explanations and elaborations of that case, is not
that the government cannot aid the churches; it is that tho
government can neither help nor hurt.

Certainly not on purpose

Can neither help nor tort.
tod in the face of this mandate of the First
fonen&nont, what is the government to do when it can81 avoid
one or tho other?
How, I think this is a false dilemma,

X think that

the Wain opinion quite correctly rejected the concept that
the exemption amounted to positivo sponsorship of a church, or
direct active assistance to the church.
What the government is faced with, the Legislature
is faced with here is four types of organisations s

governments

organisations, privata for-profit organisations, charitable
non-profit organisations f and churches and religious organisa­
tions »
Mow, in the choice between taxing and not taxing,
when it comas to the governmental organisations, the government
is certainly not going to tax unless it engages in seats budget
bookkeeping, a shifting of the burden among different elements
of the government.
hi

t.

private for-profit organisationf tho Federal

Government and the States have elected to tax

44
And In the charitable non-profit organisations, the
Federal Government and the State Governments have elected not
to tax.
Now, when they found to the churches and the religious
organisations, which of these three categories are churches
most like?

Well, they’re certainly not governmental organisa­

tions, and they’re certainly not private fot-profit organiza­
tions, because if they were they wouldn't qualify under the
legal concept of'a church.

So they're much more similar to

charitable non-profit organisations than to anything else,
And in view of the fact that many churches do engage
in charitable activities in addition to the basic worship and
preaching that they do, it is eminently sensible for a Legis­
lature to treat churches and religious organisations in the
same way that it treats charitable non-profit organisations.
But there's more to this than just reasonableness,
because our historical tradition shows that this is the
choice that all of the States and the Federal Government have
in fact made. And if we have any reverence for the choices of
our ancestors, it seems to ms we ought particularly to
reverence those that they not only practiced but they
professed as being the right solution.
Ass far as the entanglement question is concerned,
it saoms to m© that that is entirely spurious in this
particular case,

'there has been no evidence whatsoever of that

45
entanglament, and there its no need for it under this kind#
which ie the only statute involved in this case, which permits
the organisation to do# to engage in this type of renting*
As far as policing the income is concerned, again
that is a spurious claim, because in order for you to qualify
initially as a church, the State has to be entitled to review
that, has to b© entitled tc make at least simple external
t$$bs of the uses to which the property and income of that
organisation is put? so we can’t have tax exemptions of any
kind, and we couldn't have taxation of any kind, either,
if the entanglement doctrine ware pushed to the point where
the State could not engage in simple external auditing at
definito periods of time*
the last reason that would really justify and increaeom
the justification for this ehoiea of all the States ie that if
they wore to single out churches as a special class, the
churches would, as a practical matter, simply restructure their
legal entities for holding their charitable non-profit
activities.
Xn other words, if the doctrine were that the church
could, be exempted with respect to these traditional

income-

producing activities of the home facility, then the churches
would s'^ia off all their other activities into other types of
A.

v*

corporations, and this seems to be an absolutely useless kind
of gesture to forces the churches to make*

WowPif'Jtfoc church whittles itself down to where it
ir-: simply conducting a house of worship, then w&ls is absolute
authority for-t th®' exesaptability from the property tax of th©
house of worship.
Q

And you arc assuming, for example, that in this

case the church could sell its parking lot to a corporation and
then retain the shares in th® corporation?

MR» WEBLAKs

Well# it certainly could do that? of

course the corporation that it sold it to would have to pay the
property tax and the income tax*

Q

Yes, but th© church would receive, as the

sole shareholder, the net income?
MR* WHSlAKs After taxes*

That's your hypothesis is what it had to

MR. WHijl-AM;

Q

»

Yes, but take

that the State could constitutionally do?

MR. WHELAN:

Sure.

It has every right to do that*

Well, 1 think in conclusion I can sum it up this
way:

The appellants are asking this Court to decide a question

that's not presented by this case.

They're asking the Court to

decide a question — to the extent that they're asking this
Court to decide the question that is presented, th© case is
moot*
