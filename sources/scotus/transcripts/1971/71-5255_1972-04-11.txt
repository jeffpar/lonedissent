ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. MILLIMAN, ESQ.,

MR, MILLIMAN:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
First, I would like to reserve five minutes for
rebuttal, if 1 may.
The facts of this case are as follows; —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

The signal for that,

Mr. Milliman, will be whan your whit® light goes on.
MR. MILLIMAN?

Thank yon, Your Honor.

The facts of this case are as follows;
The petitioner, Willie Mae Barker, was indicted in
September of 1958 for the murder of Orleans Deaton? a vicious,
heinous crime, in which he was accused of bursting into a
bedroom and beat her to death with a tire iron ? with an
accomplice, one Silas Manning, who becomes very relevant.
His case was originally set for trial in October of
1158.

However, there occurred a series of 16 continuances

granted the prosecution in this case.

Willie Mas Barker was

not brought to trial until October of 1963, a delay in excess

of five years..

Q

Excuse me.

Did counsel receive notice of the

motions for continuance?
MR. MILLIMAN;

Yes, Your Honor, he had full notice

of these motions for continuances.
Q

Does the record show whether or not he was

present, or were the motions simply filed by
MR. MXLLIM/vNj

'The record does not show whether

he was present, Your Honor, for these continuances.
There was no objection made to these continuances
until 1962, at which point counsel started objecting to these
continuances.
But Barker was released on bail.
Q

How many continuances were granted over the

objection of your client's counsel?
MR. MILLXMAN:
Your Honor.

of the Appendix.

And thereafter the counsel for Willie Mae

Barker at that time objected to further continuances.

There’s some confusion as to whether or not

it was ’62 or 563 when that motion was made?
MR. MILLIMAM:

Yes, Your Honor? the-Kentucky Court

of Appeals and the Sixth Circuit held it was 1963?that this
motion was made February 12? 1963, but —
Q

Right.

MR. Ml'LLXMfiN:

— the record — and where they

found this date? I have no knowledge? the record clearly shows
it was made on February 12, 1962.

In the Federal Government’s amicus brier it

goes into it a little bit, too; but —
MR. MILLIMAN:

Yes? Your Honor.

But the District

Court — it’s ironic —* the District Court? on page 22 of
the Appendix, pointed out that the motion was made February
26, 1962, then talked about the resulting eight-month delays
but the delay was the resulting nineteen-month delay.

So

there is confusion as to this date.
But petitioner was released on $5,000 bond in June
of 1959, and remained free under $5,000 bond until he was
finally convicted,
Petitioner then appealed to the Court of Appeals of
Kentucky, alleging he was denied his right to a speedy trial,
and ether errors in the trial court.
Appeals -4££irmec the conviction.

The Kentucky Court of
Then, later, petitioner

filed this habeas corpus proceeding in the District Court

for the Western District of Kentucky, which denied relief.
He appealed to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court
decision; and this court granted certiorari January 18th of
this year.
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decided
this case on two grounds.

They held that petitioner had

waived his right to a speedy trial by failing to demand trialf
that the demand rule states that, the right to a speedy trial
as guaranteed by the SiKfch Amendment is a personal right,
which may be waived.

So the Sixth Circuit computed only the

time after the first motion to dismiss was made, in computing
the length of the delay, which it found to he nine months,
using the 1953 date.
It also held that petitioner had not shown that ha
was prejudiced by the delay.
Petitioner has therefore raised two points on this
appeals

first, that the demand rule is inconsistent with

constitutional safeguards, and should not be required? and
the second issue is, where there is a five-year delay,
prejudice should be presumed as inherent in the delay.
It's important to emphasise in this case that two
amicus briefs have been filed.

Wa are concerned in this case

with a five-year delay, we are not concerned with a one-year
delay, a two-year delay.

This is correctf Your Honor.

Wall , then, how about the demand — why shouidn5

he have to demand it in order to trigger the right?
MR. MILLZM&Ns

Your Honor, in the present case, it

is contended that the demand rule as such chills his right to
a speedy trial.

We have a man here who was indicted for

willful murder.

Now, his accomplice had twice received the

death penalty.

This put him in the position of, if he has

to demand trial to protect his right to a speedy trial, he is
possibly aksing for himself — asking the prosecution to give
him the electric chair*

The result, if he is successful, is

MR, MXLLIMAf!; This is what we're contending, Your
Honor

What if he had asked?

What if he had asked for

all the continuances?
MS. MXLLXn&Ks

that?

MR. M1LLIMAN;

In that event, Your Honor, he would

have affirmatively contributed to the delay.

He would have

brought it about by his own affirmative actions, by merely
sitting back and doing nothing, he did nothing to contribute
to the delay.

And yon say that the State, nevertheless,

should he charged with that delay?
MR. Ml'LLIMANs

Your Honor, under our system of

jurisprudence, the burden of prosecution is on the State.
To require this man, Willie Mae Barker, to demand trial is
imposing the burden upon him to bring about trial, to prove
his innocence.

This is contrary to established principles in

this country.
He should not have the burden of bringing about

duty.

This is the burden of the prosecution.

It is their

The American Bar Association has disapproved of the

demand rule for this reason, that the burden is on the
prosecution to bring trial, not on the defendant.
But when does the defendant demand trial?

which can be waived, like venue, if you fail to demand it.
Q

Wall. you6 re treating it as something basically

like a statute of limitations', and this runs without regard
to the defendant, say, in a civil case giving notice , to say
that he’s invoking the statute of limitations.

He simply

comes in after it’s run and says —
MR. MILLIM&Ns
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

The problem, as I see it, with your position

is that there isn't any fixed time that you're talking about,
the way there is with the statute of limitations? at least,
the State has notice that if they don’t, for constitutional
purposes, try a person within a certain period of time,
then they’re through.
MR. MILLXM1Nt

Well, Your Honor, we submit that the

burden, since the burden is on the State to bring about trial,
that notice to the State is not nearly as essential as
notice to tha defendant as to when the demand must be made.
In this case, petitioner Willie Mae Barker had no
idea as to when a demand must be made.

He made a motion to

dismiss on February 12th, 1952? he filed another motion to
dismiss prior to trial, because it was denial of the right to
a speedy trial.
Q

But both of those motions —
He never did ask for a speedy trial? he asked

that the indictment be dismissed, isn’t that right?

13
MR. MILLIMANs

This is correct, Your Honor, and

this raises another problem.

The Sixth Circuit held that the

motion to dismiss was equated with the demand.

The Solicitor

General’s brief and other courts have held that a motion to
dismiss is not a demand.

MR. MILLIMAN?

But petitioner had none of these

Respondent, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, has

superfluous, that it wouldn’t have been granted.

It was a

useless act to require him to demand trial, and after

to prove his innocence.

Q

That is correct.

— in trying this one?

MR. MILLIMAN:

Now, this brings us to the second

issue, the issue of prejudice.

Looking at the bare record in

this case, there is no specific example of prejudice, except
for the testimony of one witness, Martha Barber, sioter-in-law
of the accomplice Silas Manning, who could not recall certain
specific events, but otherwise testified with certainty.
Q

What kind of prejudice are you talking about?

Evidence at the trial ~~
MR. MXLLIMANs
Q

Actual prejudice in the form —-

This was at the trial?

MR. MILLIKAN:

Yes, Your Honor, in the form of lost

witnesses, faded memories ~
Q

Well, what about other prejudice that the

speedy trial provision is supposed to protect against?
MS. KILLIMANs

The speedy trial provision, as this

Court has held, in each speedy trial case brought before it,
pretrial anxiety, hostility in the community, loss of jobs,
curtailment of associations.

There's even more of a specific

pretrial prejudice hers.
0

Well, how do you square that with your earlier

15
giuteat that ha really doesn't want a trial, and therefore
should not be put to the burden of asking for what he doesn't

want?
MR. MXXsLIMAHt

Simply because» that, he has the right

under the Sixt h Amendment to be brought quickly to trial,
whether he ask s for it or not.

Now, it may be that he

af£1rraative1y does not want ferial.

He will make the motion

for continuances I
As everyone knows, a defense lawyer could continue a
trial indefinitely, and if he had actually wanted or was
afraid of being brought to trial, he would have moved for a
continuance.
Now, it’s true that the reason for this delay was
the Commonwealth of Kentucky's desire to secure the testimony!
of the accomplice, Silas Manning,

And it's true that if Silas

Manning wore never convicted, Willie Mae Barker would never
have been convicted.

We concede this.

The Commonwealth admits it.
Q

Or if you had gone on trial before he did, he

wouldn't have been convicted?
MR. MILLXMAN:

This is correct, Your Honor.

So

that what the Commonwealth was doing was postponing Willie
Mae Barker's ferial until they convicted Silas Manning.
There is only one problem —
Q

Until they got the evidence and the conviction?

10
Mil, MILLIM&Ns

This is correct, Your Honor,

It

only took them six trials to convict Silas Manning.
And so there is prejudice even there, that if he had
been brought speedily to trial, of course the testimony of
Silas Manning would not have been available to convict hip.
But this doesn't appear in the black-and-white record.
More fundamentally, petitioner is now released on
parole.

He was paroled in August of 1971, after serving eight

years of a life sentence.
Now, had he bean brought to trial in 1959, and in
Kentucky the normal sentence is seven or eight years for a life
imprisonment, had he been brought to trial in 1959, it's
very reasonable to assume that he would have been released
four or five years ago to resume his rightful place in society,
Q

I'd say that it's even more reasonable to

assume he might have been acquitted, if Manning's testimony
hadn’t been available.
MR. MILLXMAN; Well, had he been brought to trial
without the testimony of Silas Manning, Your Honor, the
Common

Kentucky has admitted specifically, in its

response' to the mot Ion to dismiss, October 9, 1963, that they
could not convict Will® Mae Barker without 'the testimony of
Silas Manning.
Q

They admitted this.
Suppose the witness that was needed for this

conviction had been a fugitive from justice, living in Algeria

or Canada or some place where
brought

he couldn't be reached and

back, world you think that would alter the State's

posture on the delay?
MR» MILLIMAN:

If Silas Manning had been a fugitivef

it would have given some more sufficient reason for the delay,
whether it would have justified it for five years is highly
debatable»

In other words, there would be a burden on the

prosecution to make every effort to bring this man back.
But it certainly would be more sufficient reason than in the
?resent case

Q

Well, was his testimony in the circumstances

of this case any more or less available in realistic terms
than if he had been in Algeria?
MR. M JLLII-i&N:
at all times.

Yes, Your Honor.

If was available

All the Commonwealth of Kentucky had to do was

convict him.
With all due respects to the Commonwealth of
Kentucky, the only reason for the delay here was their
incompetence and their inability to convict this man.
errors they committed.

The

One conviction was reversed because

of the admission of illegally seised evidence; and the
admission of ar. involuntary confession.

Another conviction

was reversed because they insisted on trying the crime in the
venue where the crime was committed, amid pretri.nl hostility.
They made these motions. They tried Silas Manning

IB
Ta&y

committed these constitutional errori and procedural

errors , in an attempt to convict him for a procedural
advantage, for a strategical advantage? .but could net succeed
because the Court of Appeals would slot affirm the conviction
obtained under these grounds.
So ha was there. All they had to do was convict him
legitimately.
Q

Mr. nilliman, you state in your brief that

there cannot be a passive waiver of the right to a speedy
trial.

Do yen consider that failure of counsel to object to

these 16 continuances was a passive waiver?
MR. MILL IIIAH s

No, Your Honor, I do not,

I think

his failure to object was more on the grounds of perhaps of
procedural error, in the sense that an attorney fails to
object to a hearsay statement or a leading question and is
precluded from raising it on appeal.
Q

Are you suggesting that a continuance,

particularly one granted 16 times, is procedural so far as fch
right to a speedy trial is concerned'?
MR. MJLLIMMj

No, Your Honor, I believe that is

most substantive in a constitutionally defined area, and
that’s why Z say that his failure to object should not be,
and would not. be a passive waiver of any kind.

Bees this record show what happened to Mr.

Manning?
MR. MILLIKAN:

Mr. Manning finally, the Appendix

doesn't show, the transcript of record, Your Honor, would show
that Mr. Manning was convicted In March■of•1963 to life
imprisonment, and convicted in December — or March of 1962,
I’m sorry, to life imprisonment, and in December of 1962 to
Ufa imprisonment for the murder of the other party.

There

were two parties killed.
And he served, life sentence — I don’t know if
he’s still in jail or not,
0

And how many other trials were there?

MR. MILLIKANs
Your Honor.

Mr. Manning was tried six times.

The first trial resulted in a hung jury; the

second trial, he received the death penalty.

The Court of

Appeals of Kentucky reversed that because of the admission
of illegally seised evidence and the admission of an involun­
tary confession, I believe,
Q

Then I suppose one could argue that, with all

these trials, the memory of witnesses is indeed kept alive.
MR. MILLIKAN:

It is possible that the memories of

the witnesses would be kept alive, and it’s possible that
the hostile attitude of the community was indeed kept alive,

22
a 3. so»

This was a viclone. erim-s of two prominent people, in

a rural community»

And it is vary possible that the Manning

trials 3-capt alive the hostility of the community to the
petitioner in this case.
Q

We don’t know this, I’m speculating.

You’re not suggesting that the community

attitude would be more hostile in 1963 than it would have been
in .1958, are you?
MR. M2LLIMM?s

Yes, Your Honor, 1 am.

For the

simple reason, here we’ve had one indicted murderer tried
sis times.

The Commonwealth Attorney of Kentucky is going to

have a very difficult time explaining to the electorate why he
can't convict this man«

And the fact that this man is not

being convicted is going to stir the animositye£ the
community.
In fact, petitioner’s first two trials were tried
at the scene of the crime, the county of the crime.

His

third trial, he requested a change of venue because of
hostility, which the court refused,
Q

Barker got three trials?

MR. MXXillMM?2
Q

No.

I’m talking about Manning now.

Oh.

MR. M2LLIMAH;

So this leads me to believe that the

hostilities increased as time went by, because nothing had
been done to bring those two people to trial, or nothing
had been done to Convict them.

And w© have to understand the

23

attitude and the sircmatances at the time.
Q

Yet that attitude -seems to have not interfered

with his being placed on parole.
MR. MILLIKAN:
Your Honor.

When did he go on parole?

He went on parole in August of 1971,

And I submit to you that the attitudes of rural

Kentucky have changed greatly from 1958 to 1970.

Theres s &

possible explanation why -he•had -been paroled•in 1971, and why
there was hostility in the early 1960‘s.
Q

What was the situs here, Hopkinsville?

MR. MILLXMAN:

This was Christian County, Kentucky?

Hopkinsvile, the county seat, in southern Kentucky.
Q

That’s a pretty good-sized town.

MR. MILL!MANs

Yes, it is.

And we won't go into

things not in the record, Your Honor? but — thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Milliman.

ORAL ARGUMENT O? ROBERT W. WILLMOTT, JR., ES0.,
ON BEHALF OF THF RESPONDENT
MR.. WILLMOTT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The facts in this case are not in dispute.

The

Commonwealth did delay the trial of the petitioner for five
years.

And y. think a little more thorough explanation of

why it. delayed it is in order.
The Commonwealth chose to prosecute Silas Manning

first,

This decision, I don*t know why it was made, but the

Commonwealth Attorney did make it»
And,

33

stated by my brother, they did have some

difficulty in obtaining a valid conviction.
I don’t think it can be blamed on any incompetence
on the part of the Commonwealth Attorney,

And after — in

December of 1982, when Manning’s final trial was held, trial
was set for the next term of court, the February term of the
3.963 Christian County Circuit,
The chief corroborating witness was the sheriff of
Christian County, Sheriff McKinney.

He became seriously ill

with a stomach disorder, he was later admitted to the hospital
and portions of his stomach were removed, and he later under­
went a gall bladder operation.
Q

Well, when did that — that didn’t corns until

1963?
MR. WXLLMOTT:
Q
does it?

1963.

Well, that doesn't explain 9SB to ’63 at all,

It doesn't affect that, doss it?
MR. WILLMOTT:

Wo, it's just an' explanation of the

last ten months or so of the delay.

The first four years of

delay were duo to Manning being unavailable for testimony.
Q

Yes, if it were a ten-month delay, we probably

wouldn't be hare on this case, would we?

MR. WILLMOTTs Right, Your Honor

23

*

Q

Probably.

MR. WILLMOTT:

Right.

The Commonwealth submits that the real issue in
this case is not when the demand should be made, or if a demand
should be made? but narrows down to the fact, may the
Commonwealth delay a trial for any reason for this period of
time,
Nov;, there are several statutes from different
States which call for a dismissal of the indictment, similar
to the Federal Rule 48(b), if a trial is not had within so
many days or so many months or so many terms of court.

But

every rule or every statute also states, in the final line,
"unless good cause be shown."
And our contention is that the Commonwealth had
good cause in this case,

it's a simple fact, without

Manning we would net foe here today, because petitioner would
not have been convicted.

And without the sheriff, the

corroborating evidence would have been insufficient to support
the testimony of an accomplice.
Q

Did Manning

Manning didn’t testify — I mean

the petitioner didn't testify at Manning's trial, did he?
MR. NIXiLMOTT:

Ho, sir.

And Manning never took the

stand.
Q

Then the State, the Commonwealth had evidence.

other evidence against Manning, is that right?

2S
MR. v?XLLMCTTi

Yes» sir.

They had — they found

this cat, or the —
Q

You’re telling us that the petitioner could net

have been convicted without the confederate Manning’s testimony,,
MR. WILXiMQTT%
Q

Yes» sir.

But apparently Manning could be and was

convicted without his confederate8 s testimony.
MR. WILLMOTTi

Well» Manning came into the house

covered with blood» and there was tangible evidence to convict
Manning,
Q

All right.

MR, WXLLMCTTt
Q

But Manning was •—

And that clearly shows why the Commonwealth

chose to try banning first.

You said you didn’t know.

It's

very clear why they did» isn’t it?
MR. WXRLMOTT; Wellf yes. sir» X believe that is the
reason that they felt more assured of securing conviction of
Manning..

The evidence was stronger against Manning than it

was against Barker*
Q

So that unless they convicted Manning, they

couldn’t have convicted either of them.
MR. WILLMOTT:
Q

Right.

Initially they were relying on his confession.

Manning’s confession.

In the Barker case or the Manning case?

The manning case.
Wasn’t that one of the reasons for reversal in one

No, sir.

...

Sight.

So they did have a confession from Manning?
MR. WILLMCTT:
Q

Yes, sir,

But. not from this defendant?

MR. WILLMOTT: This -- there was an admission made by
Barker along the lines of, when the sheriff cams to arrest
him# he blurted out, before being ashed or told anything,

"1f

you5re wondering what happened to those old folks# Manning
did it."
And that was a major portion of the sheriff’s
testimony# was this admission.
Now# as stated# the reason for the delay in this
case is legitimate# in my opinion,

The interest of society

had to be balanced against the interest of the accused.

And

if there is a valid reason# if there can be any valid
reason for postponement of a trial for five years# this case
presents the asms.
Q

And you would argue this if Barker had, every

2e

week, demanded a trial?

MR. WILLMOTTs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

So I gather your submission is that we don't

have to view, not actually concession, I take it, but on the
premise that the speedy trial guarantee does not require the
accused to make a demand,

Assuming that premise, you say,

nevertheless, the State, for good reason, may continue a trial
until it's ready to go to trial?
MR, WILLMOTTs

Right, Your Honor.

demand issue is secondary,

I believe the

I do not feel that the accused

should bs allowed to play both ends against the middle, and
sit back and not take any affirmative action,
Q

But if the rule were that he had to make a

demand, we don't reach this point?
MR, WILLMOTTs

I don't think —- I think you have

to consider both of them, in a case such as this.
Q

You could prevail on either point, I take it,

if the Court were to adopt the line of reasoning favorable to
you?
MR, WXLLMGTTs Right, Your Honor.

1 think initially

there's very little guidance on what constitutes good cause
the government delaying the trial.

There’s ample

evidence as to the defendant filing dilatory pleadings or
shuffling hie feet and avoiding trial, being a fugitive,
being incompetent.

These do not violate the right to a speedy

29
tria!»
Q

Yes.

KB, WILLMOTT:

However, there is very little guidance

as to why the government may delay a trial.

Most decisions

have followed the Lutaman case, which necessitates a demand.
And if a demand is not made, waiver is presumed.
Q

And you could prevail, I suppose, still on a

third ground, with or without demand, with or without good
cause on the part of the Commonwealth, and the last, the
constitutional provision is not violated without a shewing of
prejudice.
MB. WILLMOTTt

Yes, sir? that is my position.

The

only prejudice that could he assumed, and my brother points out
*

in his brief, that possible prejudice may be presumed, in
that he suffered the scorn or the stigma of being under an
indictment for five years for a horrendous crime, such as
murder.

There is no actual, physical, tangible prejudice

shown•
All the witnesses testified. They were also wit­
nesses at Manning's trial.

And by the petitioner's trial

they were thoroughly versed in their testimony, and one has
but to read the evidence to see how concrete they were in
answering their questions.
Q
finally held?

But Manning did testify at the trial that was

30
MR. V.27sU-1CWz
Q

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor* at Barker's trial.

.and it was his testimony and the sheriff’s

testimony that were the two major factors?
MR. willmgtt:

Yes, sir. There was other corroborating

evidence, but it war not what one would consider the major,
key witness.
Q

Well,, 1 take it, Manning described the crime

that had been 'committed by the two man together?

And that the

sheriff's testimony with respect to the admissions was the
corroborating evidence?
MS. WILLMOTTs Well, the sheriff was also the one
that found the car

Barker's car parked in front of the

house next door, and ha had some other investigative facts
that he put in.
Q

To meet the Kentucky requirement of corrobora­

tion of testimony?
MR. WILLMOTTs

Yes, sir.

1 think his testimony

alone would have been enough; but 1 don't think the sum of the
other testimony would have been enough to corroborate Manning’s
testimony.
0

This was not a felony murder, 1 take it, burglary

or robbery, or something?
MR. WXLLK3T?: They initially were drinking and
needed roms r.:oasy# aac they had heard that Mr. and Mrs. Denton
kept large sums of money

Q

So that they did break in for that purpose?

ME. WXLLMQTT?

Yes, sir? they went in the window

with a tire . i • ;oi, and proceeded, I think they hit Mrs. Denton
first, while she was in bed»

Q

Mr. Willmott — excuse me.

MS. WXLLMOT?*
Q

Yes, sir.

Did /. interrupt you in your pursuing —

ME. W1LLM0TT:
Q

They -

No, sir? go ahead.

I understood you to say that there were one or

more Kentucky statutes that related to speedy trial, and in
each instance provided that just cause would be an excuse
for not going forward.

Are those statutes cited in the

briefs or in the record?
ME. WZLLMOTT:

Your Honor, I may have misled you,

3: didn't mean to say that Kentucky had some statutes.

There's

Other States.

Other States have enacted —

California and Illinois, for example.

MR. WXLXJ40TT:

And the Model Penal Code,

2 believe contains a provision.

May 2 ask this question on an entirely different

Would you refresh my recollection as to what motions

were mads after the petitioner's first motion to dismiss in
1962, I think it was February of

'62, and the date of the trial?

MR. WXLLMOTT i
Q

there ware three others

Three others.

MR. WXLLMOTT:

There was the initial one in February

of *62; there was one in the summer, 1 believe in July of *62«
Q

Right.

MR* WXLLMOTT: And then there was one in March of *63
in the summer of “63, June or July, and then at trial, just
before the trial started.
Q

The ground for all of those was unavailability

of witnesses?
MR. WXLLMOTT;
0

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, the ground for the motion was the denial

of a right fee a speedy trial, wasn't if?

Yes, sir.

It was the motion for continuances that I was

asking about.

Oh, I beg your pardon.

Mr. Willmott, the Court rendered an opinion in

United States v, Marion last December.

This is not cited in

your brief or in the other brief or in the main amicus brieft
it is cited in the government's amicus brief.

Dees this —

are you familiar with this case?
MR. WILLMOTT%

Your Honor, I picked up a slip sheet

on it this morning, when 1 became aware of it. We did not
have the advance sheet in our office before I came down to
Washington.
Q

Well, what I wanted to ask you, of course, and

Perhaps you can't comment on it, is whether you feel it has
any pertinency in this case.
I’ll ask the same question of your opponent when he
is up in rebuttal.
MR. WILLMOTT: Well, as I understand Marion, it was
a pre-indictment delay, and this Court held that the Sixth,
Amendment speedy trial clause was not applicable to preinclictment de 1 ays.
Now, the concurring opinion

J4
Under all circumstances?

Q
ME.

applicable

"O

WILLMOTTs

That was my opinion , that it was not

the pre“-indictment stage, because a person had

not become an eccussd»
rv’

Right.

MR. WILLMOTT;

Back : ii the prejudice argument, we

have stated that there were no lost witnesses, that the
witnesses5 memory was —« there, was no mnemonic loss, no lack
of testimony to align this cas* ; with a case such as dickey,
which states that if a person *! ; defense is impaired or it is
lost through some witnesses cy. Lngr disappearingj, or being
unavailable, then I think this would distinguish this case
from Dickey.
So, in the main, and 1 think the Commonwealth's
contentions can foe divided into three categories:

the first

is that if there is such a thing as a valid government delay,
that this case must meat the standards.

And we base this

on the fact that in applying the demand rule, the demand
was made after almost four years, three and a half years had
passed.

That the reasons for the delay were valid.

There

would have been no conviction in this ease if uhe Commonwealth
had been forced to trial earlier than it was.
There was no lack of diligence on the part of the
Corsnoawealth in this case.

1 am certain, that the Commonwealth

Attor:;iny in E opfc ia s Co m ty

- Christian. County, excuse ms,

got vary tired :>£ this case.

He was in court with it every

open term of court, or else Manning had an appeal pending«>
He wanted to conclude this more than anyone, I would assume»
Q

Mr. vJillmott. is the Kentucky State Court

setup such that a court is continuously sitting except for
vacation time in Christian County, or does it just sit on
circuit there, at certain times of the year?
MR. WILLMOTT:

In Christian County, it is not a

continuous ses sion,
Q

How many sessions of court do they have each

year in Christian Comity?
MR. WILLMOTTs Three sessions, I believe.
Q

And how long does an average session last?

Approximately?
MR. WILLMOTTs

I would say a month and a half or two

months.
Q

So a court would ba sitting in Christian County

maybe six months out of the twelve of each year?
MR. WILLMOTT;

Unless -- I think there is a provision

for a prolonged calendar if the docket load is heavy,
unusually heavy.

I don't think they're bound to a specific

termination date on each call.
So the prejudice resulting from this delay, that
hae been argued, was r.ot great.

Petitioner was not the object

of a prolonged delay in order to gain an advantages the

It went to

tec it is very

the petitioner was — came

very close to not being tried when sheriff McKinney want in
the hospita1.
Q

How soon after that was Manning tried the

first time?
MR. WILLMOTT s

He was tried at the first term of

court, in October.
Q

Within six months after the murder?

MR. WILLMOTTs
Q

Two months, three months.

Three months after the murders.

MR. WILLMOTT:

I think the murders were on July the

20th, and he was tried October the 9th, 1 believe is the date
of his first trial.

ted he was prosecuted every succeeding

term of court, or held an appeal pending in the Kentucky Court
of Appeals at every subsequent term of court.
So this, coupled with the fact that the petitioner's
defense was in no way impaired, that the demand was hot made
until very late in the time period, and no loss of prejudice,
and the good cause for which the continuances were granted,
the Commonwealth submits that these grounds are sufficient
and adequate to affirm the Sixth Circuit's opinion.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Willmotfc,

Mr. Milliman, yew h ave a fow minutes left.

Do you

have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. M1LLJMAN, ESC». »
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. MXLLIMAN2

yea, Your Honor.

I'd like to express my opinion on the reason for
delay.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did not specifically

decide this question.

They decided simply that from the

period of the time the demand, which they found to be
February the 12thr 1963, to the time of trial, that there was
a sufficient reason.

We did not specifically urge this point

on our petition for certiorari for the simple reason that the
Court of Appeals did not really decide it, and that this
Court could conceivably, if they wished, remand to the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals for further findings on that issue,
if they would strike down the demand rule and hold that
petitioner has shown or is not required to show prejudice.
It could remand to the Sixth Circuit for further findings as
to the reason for delay.
hs His Honor, I believe, Justice Blackman referred
to the C. S. vs,» Marion case, we would like to accept the good
and reject the bad,

The Marlon case is not applicable to this

case, for the. simple reason that in that case this Court
held that the defendants were not an accused, because they were
talking about a pre-indictment delay, and that the Sixth

38

&s: -mdsscnt applies only to an accused , and one does not become
an accused until he i-p indicted.
And there's no question in this case that Willie Mae
Barker fits the definition of an accused.
The Marion case would be applicable in that it
explained that the statute of limitations, for example, are
designed to guarantee against stale claims.

And of course in

Kentucky and most States there is no statute of limitations fo
murder.

So there is no statute of limitations to apply in

this case,
And it did point out again, it reaffirmed this
Court's position of the prejudice resulting from the pretrial
delays, the anxiety, the hostility, and so forth.

So in that

respect it is most applicable to this case.
Q

But up to February 12th, 1962, your anxiety

and hostility arguments really don’t square with your
argument that he didn’t want to have this confrontation with
society, and that that’s why he didn’t ask for it.
ME. MILL2MAH:

Again, Your Honor*, 1 would refer to

the American Bar Association project for minimum standards,
that this is no reason for delay, that his acquiescence or
the fact that he may desire to —
Q

But that doesn’t justify delay.

I simply was

addressing that observation to the weight of your argument
on that point.

39
MR. MILLIE?:

Your Honor, 2 would concede that

Willis Mao Barker probably

1 don5 t know this for a fact ~

probably did not want to be tried.

X don’t think any man

wants to be tried. land X don't, consider this a liability on
his behalf.

I don’t blame him.

What he was trying to do was, once he found Manning
had been convicted, than, of course, he wanted the ease
dismissed. There’s no question about this.
Q

The way

You’re not arguing that every accused person

is in the posture of not wanting a trial, are you?
MR. MILLIMAN;

No, Your Honor, I’m sure that some

accused people do? but even to someone who’s innocent, there
is always the specter that he may be convicted, even though
innocent, and the fact that he is going to come to trial
is going to cause him great apprehension, unquestionably.
Q

That specter might be more acute if he knows

that he’s guilty, wouldn’t it, so that you can’t really
generalise on that.
MR. MILLIMANs
acute or not, Your Honor.

I don’t know if it could be more
A guilty man may well be resigned

to his fate.
Q

Well, ara you making any claim that the counsel

was inadequate in this case?
MS, MILLIMAN:

Q

Well

Ho, Your Honor, I’m not.

he was counseled, and if the State

40

evidence was so weak, you would think there might have been
an interest in an early trial.
,

'

j

MR. MILLJMANs This is quite possible.
Q

Weil» how about if counsel makes the decision

that it's better to wait than to try now. that might fee a
gross error? but it might not foe a gross error.
MR. MlIiLXMAN:

Again, Your Honor, to answer this

question in the affirmative would be to require the speculation
from the record that he did take — make a strategical
maneuver.
Q

Well» counsel had the choicec£ either objecting

or not objecting.
MR. MXLLXMAN; This is true, Your Honor. This is
true.
Q

And he exercised that choice, by not objecting?

MR, MXLLXMAN:

We don’t know whether he did —- he

exercised that choice, but we don’t know if he did that for a
strategical purpose or not.
Q

Well, isn’t it reasonable to assume that ha knew

the problem cf the unavailability of Manning until Manning’s
conviction was definite?
MR. MILLIM&N:

Well, Your Honor, it’s possible that

he thought that they had other grounds to convict, based upon
the testimony of the sheriff.

Wow, looking at the scene of

the trial, it’s quite possible that he thought, under the

41
hostility prevailing at the time» if there was such, that the
man would have been convicted, based upon the testimony of the
sheriff.

We don't know his reasons for not demanding a

speedy trial, but we do know that it would have been superflu­
ous .
Q

But, isn't it reasonable to assume that when

the prosecution asked for a continuance, they were required
to give a reason, that the reason was that Manning was not.

MR. MILLIMANs
Q

Wasn't that a fact known to everybody?

MR. MILLIKAN:
Q

This was ~

This is reasonable, Your Honor.

To the extent that the

defense counsel's

consent to the continuances may have been based on the
possibility of the future absence of a witness, to the extent
that the sheriff wan important to the prosecution in this
case, it almost paid off, I take it?
MR. MLLLIM&M;

It almost did, Your Honor, except

for one thing, if I may state this*

It’s important to note

that Manning was convicted of the first murder in March of
1962, but they still didn't bring Barker to trial.
tried Manning again in December of 1962.

They

Thera is no reason

in the world they couldn't have brought Barker to trial after
the first conviction of Manningj but they refused*
Q

Well, do you mean that Manning would have been

42
a willing witness just because he had a conviction —
MR. MXLLlhhHs

Your Honor ,< the record shows that

Willie Mao Barker was keeping company with Mr» Manning * s
wife at the time, and whether that would have made him a
willing witness or not, I think it would have made him more
willing than otherwise»
