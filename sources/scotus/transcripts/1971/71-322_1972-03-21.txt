PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Bremen Unterweser against Zapata Offshore Company,
Mr. Kerr, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C.G. KERR, FRQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KERR:

Mr. Chief Justice, mav it please the

Court:
The Petitioner here is Unterwoser Reederei, a
German Corporation, Bremen, Germany, owner of the sea-goina
tug BREMEN.

The Respondent is Zapata Offshore Company, a

multinational drilling company, owner of the drill ricr, selfelevating drill rig CHAPARRAL.
Very briefly, the facts and circumstances which .
bring this case to this Court have their genesis in a drilling
contract executed by and between Zapata or through its
wholly owned foreign subsidiary, an Italian comnany by the
name of

&GIP

rig CHAPARRAL off

, calling for the presence of the drill
of Ravenna, Italy, in the Adriatic.

This necessitated of course towing the CHAPARRAL from its
situs off of Louisiana to the Adriatic, off of Ravenna.
Zapata solicited bids for the towaae voyage, and
several companies responded, including the Petitioner here,
Unterweser.

Unterweser was the low bidder, and subsequently

was requested to submit a contract, and did so submit a

contract to Zapata in Houston and several changes were made
in that contract* it was executed by Zapata in Houston,
and the contract was then forwarded to Bremen,, where the
changes were accepted and the contract was executed.
The tow voyage commenced on or about January 5,
.1968* from the mouth of the Mississippi and some five days
later, in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico* a casualty occurs-which precipitated a number of losses»

Very briefly, the

nature of the casualty was the collapse of the three drilling
legs and a parting of the tow line»

the tow was reestablished

by the tug BREMEN and on orders from Zapata, proceeded to the
Port of Tampa, Florida, which was the nearest port of refuge.
On arrival at Tampa, the tug BREMEN was met ,• by
a United States Marshal and arrested in conjunction or in
connection with a complaint which had been filed by Zapata
the previous day, alleging negligent towage and basically a
complaint in admiralty based on towage»

That is the first

litigation in this particular matter, and very briefly, the
complaint was filed, and that litigation as I indicated, the
day prior to arrival of the flotilla in Tampa, and subse­
quently Unterweser filed a motion in the District Court at
Tampa, soaking among other things, that the action in Tampa
ba stayed pursuant to a form clause in the towage contract
which provided that all of the suits should be heard by the
London Court of Justice in England»

'QUESTION?

Do X understand that that clause was

the subject of negotiation before finally agreed upon, was
it?
MR. KERRs

Yes, sir.

QUESTIONs

Between the parties—there was some

discussion as to what laws should apply, was there not?
MR. KERR s

The record is devoid of indication

that there was discussion between the parties.

The only

thing that we have in the record, Mr» Justice Brennan, ia the
fact that the Director of Unterweser said that without
that clause, they would not have enterediftto this contract.
The contract was submitted, as X have indicated, by Unterweser
to Zapata in Houston, was reviewed presumably by Zapata
in Houston; they made several changes and sent that to Bremen.,
That clause was not changed in any way.
QUESTIONs That clause was in the original submissior
MR. KERR: Yes, sir, it was in the original sub­
mission.

QUESTIONs

X thought X read somewhere that there

had been some consideration of other law, besides—
MR. KERR: What you are referring to, Mr.. Justice
Brennan, is the fact that the Director from Unterweser,
that’s the affidavit of Eric von Aswegen, in

which he said

that normally Unterweser applied German law and German forms
to their contract? her®, recognising that this tow voyage

would traverse many jurisdictions, as a compromise they
selected the London form and then submitted that to Zapata,
and Zapata executed it.
QUESTION:

That decision though was made by Unter-

MR. KERRj

Yes,sir.

weser?

QUESTION: Is it your view that the parties each have
one national court for which it would have a preference, and
agreed upon a neutral court?
MR. KERR: I believe that is what happened here.
I believe this was a neutral forum and it was decided
upon as a selection of a forum in recognition that this
tow voyage was after all going to traverse many jurisdictions
and be subject to many nationalities.
QUESTION:

Well, the courts of many nationalities.

MR. KERR:

Zapata filed its motion, as I have

indicated, seeking among other things, a stay.
QUESTION:

Well, did it state English law would

apply?
MR. KERR: Wo, Mr. Justice White, it merely said
all disputes would be submitted to the London Court of Justice ,
QUESTION:

So there was no attempt to specify a

MR. KERR:

We would contend that the intent was to

law?

1

specify English law as well, and that is how the clause has

been interpreted by English courts, which also had this
case before them.
QUESTION:

You mean normally in an English court,

regardless of the location of an accident or in any other
contacts, they apply English law?
MS. KERR:

Apparently the English law on that

subject, Mr» Justice White, is where they have selected a
forum, it is presumed they have selected the forum with the
intent of having it apply its own law.
QUESTION:

Would that include the English conflict

MR. KERR:

I can’t answer that question on English

laws?

law.

As far as HI know, in this case the English court has

indicated and this I believe was in the Judge Karminski
decision in the London Court of Justice that presumably Englisl
law would apply, but whether the entire body of English
law, including conflicts and whether you get into a
situation, I cannot answer that question*
QUESTION:

Shat would be the alternative, if this

collision, this accident occurred, if damage occurred in
waters of no particular nation, isn’t that true?
MR. KERR;

That’s correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

The alternative would be, you would get into contract here
as determined by what law should this contract be construed
and what law should govern, and I think ultimately you wpuld

?

s
get to the conclusion that the contract was executed in
Bremen, Germany, and this I think would have considerable
weight,» as I understand cases thathave dealt with contracts»
it's true you have an American national, but that's out­
weighed by a German national and German flag vessel»
QUESTION;

Outweighed or balanced?

MR. KERR; Balanced,

So ultimately you come to the

proposition that the contract was executed in Germany»
Following the filing of Zapata9s motion seeking
to have this matter referred to the London Court of Justice,
the matter rested in the District Court for some months.

Xn the meantime, the tug was released by agreement of the
parties, and Unterweser gave security in the amour it of
$3«5 million.

An action was instituted in London by Unter­

weser based on breach of the towage contract, and rlapata
appeared in that action and objected to the action being
brought in London.

Ultimately the London High Court of Jus­

tice ruled that the towage contract and its form provision,
particularly the form provision was a reasonable one, and
that was sustained on appeal in the Court of Appeals in London:,

QUESTION s

Was the appearance by Zapata there a

general appearance or does it make any difference*

MR. KERR:
ance.

Well, I believe it was a special appear­

They raised the question of the reasonable!ess of

the towage—of the form provision in the court, that it should

9

not foe enforced, that there was prior action pending in the

o„s,
QUESTIONs Prior action pending where?
MR. KERR; In the U.S.
court action in Tampa.

They were referring to

It was filed in January and the

action by Unterweser in London was filed in February.
That action was pending in Tampa and pending on Unterweser*s
motion to have the case referred to London in accordance
with—
QUESTION3

What other limitations actions followed?

MR. KERRj I was coming to that, Mr. Justice
White; that comes later.
QUESTION;

Not much later though.

MR, KERR; No, sir, not much later? about six months
later.

The next procedure here was the filing by Unterweser

of . its complaint seeking exoneration and limitation of
liability.
QUESTION;

It didn't have to do that, did it, to

ultimately prevail on the issue that's here?
MR» KERR;

We submit that it had to do that in

order to protect its limitation right; which was about to
expire.
QUESTION;

Only if the forum action didn't cancel

out the American action?
MR. KERR;

If the forum provision had been enforced

by the District Court, and that had been sustained on

10

appeal because 1 presume an appeal would have bean taken,
then they would not have had to file a limitation action in
the U.So
QUESTION:

Why didn'fc they pursue that then from the

time the District Court first issued the stay of action?
HR. KERR; Because the time it would be filed, the
limitation, the complaint limitation, the District Court still
hadnot ruled on our original motion filed on the original
action.
QUESTION:

Why was the limitations action filed?

MR. KERR:

Because the six-month statute

to run; if

was about

you do not file limitation within six months

of the first written notice: you may lose that right.
You may lose it,

There is some doubt, Mr. Justice White.

The respondents have argued here that we could have filed
defensive limitation»
with it.

This has two problems connected

Problem No. i is when you file defensive limitation,

you. don’t protect your security, because you may have mobile
claims and you would, have to go to different jurisdictions
and you'd have to put up the same security in each instance
where a lawsuit was filed, and so one of the purposes would
be defeated, the purpose of having the course of litigation.
The second danger or problem in filing limitation by
answer, which is what they suggested, is essentially that

11
there is some question in the law which was never decided,
whether since the 193? amendment to the limitation act, whether
or not defensive limitation can be filed after the expiration
of six months»

Text writers say the prudent thing to do is

file a petition affirmatively within the six months.
QUESTION:

Can you file an affirmative petition

in any way something like a special appearance without
prejudice to your forum claim under the contract?
HR. KERR: Mr. Justice Brennan, that

b

precisely

what we did.
In our complaint seeking limitations, we reaffirmed
the supremacy of the forum clause, pointing out that the
court had not ruled on it? that we were compelled to file
limitations, but we still maintain and assert that that
forum clause was supreme and governed the cause and that the
matter should be referred to London.
QUESTION: If the parties at the outset had both
acknowledged the forum clause of the contract,
been in ties Florida courts

would you have

at all, in the United States court ?

MR. KERR: If Zapata had complied with its con­
tractual obligations, there would be no lawsuit in Tampa,
that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Kerr, does English law recognise the

type of admiralty limitation proceeding that United States
laws do?

IP
MR. KE'ji&s

They do, Mr. Justice Rehncfuist, but

it is somewhat different.

It is different in amount

of the limitations fund? as Respondent points out, it is
considerably less.than in the U.S. and also they have no
statute of limitations under which to filer they don’t have
the six months.

In England you can only file your limitation

acts once a claim has been asserted against you in a court.
There is no limitation period, which brings up another
point that, we did not file limitation in England because if
'would have been premature under their law because we had
no claim against us.

The London action is not an issue,

Zapata never responded on the merits because the London action
was stayed by the United States District Court.
QUESTION:

Well, what if as you suggest, Zapata

had performed its obligation under the contract, to resort
to the British forum, what proceeding would Zapata have
sought?

Rather than the one it did bring in, in Florida?
MR. KERR: They would have filed a complaint in the

British courts alleging negligent towage, alleging I presume
the same breaches, same action,
QUESTION:

And in that circumstance under British

law, what about the limitation action?

How would, that-—

MR, KERR: Under British law as we understand it,
the. moment you have a court asset a claim against you, you may
then turn around and petition for limitation. In the United

States, you could petition for limitation without any other
action being filed, just within six months of notice that
such a claim might be asserted against you.
In other words, there is no statute of limitation
in England.

What triggers the limitation under British law

is the filing of a cerrolainfc against you in court, or a
cross-claim or what have you.
QUESTIONs
saying that

Wasn't there a provision in this contract
would not be liable in any event?

MR. KERR; Mr. Justice White, there are clauses
in the contract under genera1? towing conditions which are
incorporated into the contract by reference which have been
characterized by the British solicitor in his affidavit
in this case as exculpatory, and X don’t think it would serve
a purpose to be coy about it? I think they are exculpatory.
Under the laws of Great Britain or the English law, prima
facie these are in force; that is, a tug boat is permdfcfced
to enter into such a contract with its tow.
In the United States of course this is a critical
issue in this case,
QUESTION; That's Bisso, isn't it?
MR. KERR;

That's Bisso and Dixl&yn and. other

QUESTION;

So if Zapata had ever filed an action

decisions.

in an English court, it might have been useless?

14
FR. KERR:

We say this* it's premature actually

to determine that hut the possibilities or livelihood is that
this exculpatory provision or these clauses read all together
which provide exculpatory provision, would be enforced, by the
British court.

Of course we say, Mr. Justice White, that

this was part of the contract? this was part of the expectation
and this was part of referring the case to London which was
2apat.a’s contract and this is a natural—this flows naturally
from the entry into the towage contract.
This is what they bargained for.
QUESTION: Do you know whether those clauses are
enforced in. the C4erman courts?
MR. KERR: X happen to Know that? it is not in the
record, but they are.
There is no German law in this appendix, a1thouoh
we did plead notice of foreign law including German law,
because when we filed our complaint in limitations, we were
in doubt as to what conflict of law principle ultimately might
be applicable, so in order to be completely safe, we pled
British law, American law and German law in the alternative,
I would like to come back to that guestion on
Bisso, because X think in the final analysis whatyou have here
is a clash of policies that I think is Going to be inherent
in any decision this Court might make.

On the one hand,

we have the so-called Bisso-Dixilyn policy, wherein this Court

15
stated that as a public policy matter, tugs should not be
permitted to exempt themselves or insulate themselves from
liability *

We believe that in this particular case, there

are overriding policy considerations which basically are mak­
ing parties adhere or stick to their contracts, particularly
in an international context, where the parties have selected
a forum, they have done so for a variety of reasons
in an international contract, particularly for certainty for
the law that will govern their contract, and this

is par­

ticularly true, we submit, in a case where performance
of the contract will traverse, as was the case in this instance,
many, many jurisdictions and touch upon many different—
waters of many different nations.
So we feel that, No. 1, insofar as Bisso sought to
enunciate a U.S. public policy, it is not all-pervasive
because Bisso can he circumvented by routine, day-to-day
commercial insurance practices.
Justice Frankfurter,

This was recognized by Mr.

in the original dissent, and in fact

and indeed is circumvented on a daily basis, by simply having
the tow purchase Insurance and the underwriters waive sub­
rogation. against the tug.

The tug is completely insulated

except to the extent of a small deductible, perhaps.
And in other fields of law, this Court and other courts have
recognized the right to limit one’s liability by contract
or even to exculpate onself, so we don’t feel that Bisso

If
is an all-pervasive matter of public policy.

But more

importantly,, in the context of this case, we don't feel that
Bisso is applicable, because if you extend Bisgo to cover
this situation—and we feel it's distinguishable on its facts
and circumstance—but if this Court should extend Bisso to
that extent, it would have to do so by first of all adopting
what we consider is the modern rule on foreion contract
provisions? that is, that they are prma facie valid unless
unreasonable.
QUESTION: Mr. Kerr, 1 erather you are satisfied
that in the British forum proceedings, it is improbable they
would apply American law

on the merits of this—

ME. KERR? I think it's improbable, Mr. Justice
Brennan, and I can't give you a positive answer obviousIv,
but 1' think it is improbable because they have already
indicated and their case law reflects thafcin a situation where
parties select a forum, they also intend to select the law?
otherwise, there would be little purpose in selecting the
forum. That is the law of England.

So they would probably

try English lav?, and insofar as someone would argue that
they'd have to look for American law, 1 think they would come
full circle and say if we have to look to any law here, it
would probably be German law because that's where the contract
was executed.
QUESTION?

If it were tried under either British

17
or German law, then those exculpatory clauses would be
enforced probably?
MR. KERR: Yes, sir.
QUESTION: It's only if the Bisso rule were applied
they might not?
MR. KERR: Mr. Justice Brennan, it is only if you
extend the Bisso rule and say that it encompasses this
situation, and in order to do thatyou must say that it is
/

the Biaso

rule which makes this forum clause unreasonable,

and we submit thatyou get into a situation then when you've
got to consider, is it more unreasoncible to reform this
contract after the fact in favor of Zapata and thereby frus­
trate even Zapata's contractual intent when it entered, the
contract, and at the same time put Unterweser in a position
of economic exposure that it contracted to insulate itself
from.

is that more unreasonable

or is it mere reasonable

to form a contract and enforce Bisso, extend. Bis so to cover
the situation?
QUESTION:

What you are saying, 1 take it, Mr.

Kerr, is that it's hardly reasonable to assume that the
parties would contract for British courts if they intended
to enforce American lat^, for example, in which case it would
be in the hands of judges unfamiliar with American law?
MR. KERR: Yes, sir, well we think that’s true becaus?
why would a party designate a forum unless they intend that

28
foriam to apply its law, and furthermore, we have"—there is
evidence in the record we intended British law to apply.
Zapata

for its part, is accustomed to this.

The drilling

contract which is in the appendix, that is? a contract that
its wholly owned European subsidiary entered into with the
Italians, interestingly enough provides for a British forum
and the applicability of British common law.

So we feel

that they have demonstrated familiarity with that procedure
and that indicates that they do this as a matter of routine
with them.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr. Kerr.

Mr. Nance.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES K. NANCE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. NANCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Of ccnrso I Lave my program here, written out, btC

in view of some of the questions asked by several of the
Justices, I think 'I will reply to some of these questions,
while they're fresh in your mind»
As to the towage contract itself, the provision
that the Court was inquiring about, with reference to
negotiations for the forum clause, although Mr. von Answecren,
the man who is Director of.Unterweser, made the

,

. o-

conclusory statement that he wouldn't have made the contract

but for the forum clause, in the affidavit which was before
the trial court below, regarding the party that sicrned
the contract on behalf of Zapata, it states the fact that
after Zapata accepted Unterweser3s bid above-mentioned, the
contract for towage was drafted by Unterweser and mailed
by them in Bremen to Zapata in Houston.

The draft included

the clause any dispute arising must be treated in the London
Court of Justice.

Before and after such draft was tendered

to Zapata, for acceptance, there were no discussions between
Zapata and Unterweser whatever concerning paragraph 8,
Further he also denied Hr. von Answegen’s statement
that the parties "intended that the controlling law to be
applied would be the law of the forum, English law."
At no time did affiant Unterweser Reederei discuss what law
or mention what law was intended to control in event of liti­
gation.
Simply put, after the low bid by telegram was
received, and this is in the record, Unterweser drafted
this clause.

As Mr. von Answegen5s affidavit says, "ordinarily

we include an exclusive German forum clause, which means
an exclusion of any other forum," which I discuss later on as
one of the points in our brief, and also "We usually apply
German law?" so it is on this record here, there’s nothing
you cannot

rightfully say that the parties agreed the

English law would apply

QUESTION: Were there any insurance provisions?
MR. NANCE: No, "Zapata is uninsured,, This is an
uninsured loss.

QUESTION: Mr. Nance, Zapata did through its
attorneys review this submitted contract, and did submit some
changes, did it not?
MR. NANCE:

No, your Honor, so far as I knew, no

attorneys reviewed this.
QUESTION: Well, did Zapata itself review the
contract and submit changes?
MR* NANCE:

This is not in the record, but they

must have exchanged telegrams, and in the draft of the
contract that is in the record, it shows the initials R.S.T.,

MR. NANCE: Yes, they did.

MR. NANCE:

Well, I can answer the fact the

Zapata Offshore Company, all of its rigs were uninsured.

They

simply were self-insured..
QUESTION; But m hiring a tug, a tow, is it
characteristic you don't specify that the tower carrv

MR. NANCE:

Sometimes they do? sometimes it isn’t

done. It is not mentioned in this contract.
QUESTION: It’s not mentioned in this contract?
MR. NANCE: No.
QUESTION: I’m sure it’s of no importance, but what
was the purpose of this tow?
MR. KEPJ

(inaudible) ;

Just, one more question

and reply, and then I hope I can get to the main body of
my address.

About the applicable law, it’s simple, clear.

This event happened between two nationalities, an American
and a German.

It havpened on the high seas.

Starting with

the Scotland, they don't challenge it, affirmed by this
Court in the BelgenlaiJ , affirmed by Second Circuit in
The Gy life y. The Truj:: Ilo, and I can name you dozens of cases,
they don’t challenge It, when that occurs and there are courts
involved, the law of the forum is arpLied.

This suit, both

ours, and their limitation, i’ in the United States and it

22

will apply United States law, not only to determine the rights
but also under the Titanic, the limitation actions, the
amount, of the fund is determined by the American fund, in
this case $1» almost 4 million.
recourse to only $80,000,

In England, we'd have

This is important and I'll discuss

that later on.
But I do want to get that crystal clear. On
contacts,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we have detailed in our

brief, if the Court wants to talk about, Rodiadia or Rensen,
we have detailed that up to the point of collision, it
was all done in America? this rig was prepared here, the
Germans inspected it, seaworthiness inspections, seaworthi­
ness certificates, and so forth.

It was prepared in .the

American zone.
Now I would like to get back to my own speech here.
QUESTION?

Wall, then, at some point I

’hope you

will suggest your hypothesis as to why the forum clause
was included, and what the parties intended by it.
MR. NANCE: X will do that.
Now, just in order to get to the crux of the thing,
the end result of this, if this Court overruled the
suppressionary order entered by the limitation court,
in which he determined he would assert and retain his juris­
diction, it will necessarily relegate Zapata to London where
under London law, the exculpatory clauses would defeat our

2.3

claim, and American law being applied as outlined here
before, under Biseo ^ anc- pixiiyn, and in Dixllyn that
was a freely negotiated contract, where reduced rates were
given in exchange for the
and on Bisso

, this Court per curiam

reversed the law court and held the

exculpatory clauses void and invalid.
Now what we had here was a \?esssl as tail as the
Humble Building in Houston, 44 stones tall.

There is a

picture of it in the brief, in operating position.

This

thing had been carefully moved on 32 coastwise voyages
on 32 previous occasions.

Then it was decided to send the

ship ovei’seas on a drilling contract in the Italian sea.
Special devices called locking devices which
are on the deck were to be installed on this huge 44-story
leg rig prior* to a transocean crossing.

This rig with those

tall legs simply cannot take the roll without the legs
locked,

Zapata instructed the BREMEN to tow the vessel coast

wise in 250 foot water depths, so in the event of bad weather
it could jack down its legs, jack up the rig and ride out the
weather, as I am sure you have heard about, during the hurri­
cane season.

This was not a hurricane, but a norther came

through in January and instead of going coastwise ir# jack-up
water depths, the rig was towed directly across where in
2,000 feet of water, 150 miles from the nearest jack-up
water depths of 250 feet, this bad weather hit?

the legs

24

rolled, and finally all three broke off.

There is a picture

of the damaged rig in the brief.
Wow as I stated, under American law, the court
below is entitled to consider the contention of the party
when he gets around to determine where is the evidence, which
I am going to discuss in a moment.
Now let’s focus in on what is the condition here.
Here is a case where after we filed suit, we took, we noticed
and took 25 German depositions, including Hr. von Answegenf
the Managing Director, attended by Mr. Kerr and his firm.
Thereafter, they noticed, we noticed, and they cross-noticed
involking jurisdiction of the Tampa court and took depositions
of eight Americans on the CHAPARRAL.

After that, invoicing

jurisdiction of the court below, they took two more depo­
sitions of marine surveyors in New Orleans.

They also

filed motion for discovery, we produced documents and the
file in this casa, I could not put it all on this table.
This case has been deposed and it substantially was ready for
trial in the first suit which we filed when Mr. Kerr’s
client decided to file the limitation of liability proceeding.
Let me tell you what that is, your Honors.
He mentioned that he made a special appearance, when he filed
it.

Well, just read the complaint.

Under our rules of

practice, you cannot make a special appearance in filing a
lawsuit.

Let me tell you what a limitation of liability

■proceeding is.

25
Under 181 of 46 U.S» Code, Congress provides

that a ship owner may limit his liability to the value of the
vessel if he can show he is not at fault; 183 provides it
may file :

—a limitation of liability proceeding if it

does so within six months of written notice of claim, and
assert that it is entitled to limit its liability to the
value of the vessel.

Rule F of the Rules, the Rules of

Civil Procedure elaborate on that procedure and goes into
quite detail, as we mention in our brief, the procedure he
is to go through.

Not only does Rule F allow the petition:

shipowner to assert

limited liability, but he is entitled

to claim he is exonerated from any and i everybody's claim.
Now what happened here is this.

If he could have

filed this defensively, as the courts have held, as cited
in the brief, this case doesn't turn on that.

What he

did was to file this suit and in the suit he claimed these
things, it was all the fault of the CHAPARRAL, that there
were other potential claimants, and the crew members on there
somewhat'hurt getting off, and he wanted a concourse
where all these claims could come into the suit.
an injunction out, and enj'ty*.

He got

he suit being litigated

by Tampa District Court, eniosn«d it and cited up Zapata
to come in and file their claim.

We were served with a

monition. He’s the Plaintiff and we are the Defendant.
Now what is this proceeding? It is most important,

your Honors, that you look at this forum clause in the context
of the litigation that is before you.

There's not before

you what the trial court did, that is, the ruling in the
Zapata first filed suit, denying their motion to dismiss
the jurisdiction state.

What they did in their own suit was

file a motion to stay the prosecution of our claim.
Wow, if you look through this Court's decision
in British Transport, which is cited in the,brief, there you
have the question of the United States owning one vessel,
filing a limitation proceeding.

British Transport Commission

had a vessel in collision? it came in and filed a claim.
Other parties came in and filed claims, being a concourse
here.
QUESTION s Well, were there some claims against
Unterweser other than Zapata?
MR. NANCE: No, your Honor, there have been
no claims in the suit filedup to this point.
QUESTION; Well, why would Unterweser have filed
its own limitations actions if it could have done the same
thing in Zapata's suit?
MR. NANCE: Because, your Honor, in event some other
claimant were to file a separate suit against them then,
the six months having run, then of course they —
QUESTIONs

You think this was a way of eliminating

through this limitations action then with, as you call it, a

27
concourse, of eliminating ail other claims?
MR. NANCE: No, your Honor, it was to provide that
if anybody else wanted to come in and do it, they could do so.
QUESTION: But they'd have a limited time to do so?
MR. NANCEs Under the procedure, your Honor, the
court sets a time.
QUESTIONs Yes, that's what I mean.

But Outer™

waser this way could say anybody else who has a claim,
coxae in and file it?
/

MR. NANCEs That’s right.
QUESTIONS And if they didn’t, that was the end of it
MR. NANCEs

Well, your Honor, actually there are

no other claims filed, but other people could come in today
and file one now because no order of default has been entered.
But let me address myself to this point. In the British
Transport case, this Court characterized the limitation pro­
ceedings a a one th&t reconstitutes
it and the plaintiff.

as a cross-liable between

That was a case where the claimant

British Transport was cross-claimed against by other
claimants; it was cross-claimed against by the original
petitioner.

And this Court was confronted with the contentior

that the petitioner could not do that, said that everybody
that’s in it can cross-claim and sue each other.

But the

point of it is that in this case, the petitioner hare has
submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court.

There is

no rule for providing for any special appearance»

The basis

of his motion today is based solely on the basis of the
forum clause.

He has said, 1 am entitled to exoneration

from the world? he says 1 am entitled to limit my liability?
he has sued us, he has cited us to come in there, and we've
cross-claimed.

We followed cur claims.

Now he also counterclaimed against us for every
claim he had filed in the London suit.

In addition, he

put. it in terras not of breach of contract but in terms of
tort.

Furthermore, he filed a brand new thing called salvage,

salvage claim

in Count 2.

I-Ie claims that everything that

happened after the legs were lost, was outside the contract?
that he in other words, therefore, is a stranger who came
lip to the wreck, put a line on it, and towed it to the
nearest port of refuge.

He has asked the admiralty court

below to give him an award for salvage.

Well, the vessel

was worth about $3 million after the wreck, and it is not
unusual for an admiralty court to give, say, 10 percent or
something like that.

That would amount to S300,000»

The point is, may it please the Court, that he
submitted himself voluntarily to the jurisdiction of the court,
below.
QUESTION?

Well, would a salvage claim be a el

under the contract?
MR. NANCE? They have alleged, your Honor,

29

specifically, that it arose outside the contracto
QUESTION:

Anyone who had picked up the vessel and

towed it to port or engaged in salvage operations could bring
a suit, could they not?
MR, NANCE: Yes, your Honor, they could make a claim
for salvage if they rescued a wreck on the seas.
QUESTION:

I era a little confused.

You say it is

under the contract?
PR. NANCE: They claim it was outside the contract.
QUESTION: What do you say?
MR. NANCE: Well, we deny it, but that's for the
Court to decide. I am saying to you, your Honor, that he
has submitted himself to the jurisdiction of a limitation
court in filing the counterclaims, particularly the one
where he filed a counterclaim for salvage, and he has asked
this Court here, to give him an affirmative recovery.
QUESTION:

Let us assume Zapata had followed the

languageof the contract and had filed suit:in London—let's
just assume that—do you think it would have been inconsistent
with that forum clause for Unterweser then to file a limitations
action in the United States, to attempt to. have other possible
claimants file--surface their claim?
MR. NANCE:

Well, Mr. Justice White, whatever fchcv

wanted to do, they could do.

The question before this Court

is, having submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the

30
limitation court, and having invoiced it, he is not ashing
for affirmative relief of exoneration of liability.

He

is asking for limited liability and counterclaiming. He
has thereby fully submitted himself to the court and he's
not. in position to say just because of a forum clause,
don't let Zapata try to claim.
QUESTION: But he did all this, as X understand it,
in the limitations court ». expressly without prejudice to
the reliance on the forum clause.
MR. NANCE:

Well, your Honor--

QUESTION: And you are saying that reservation is
meaningless.
P'iR. NANCE: It's meaningless, your Honor. He has
either submitted himself or he hasn’t,

I want to call

attention to two decisions of this Court where a counter­
claim was filed—
QUESTION: Before you come to that, let me see if

I can try ona other thing, the same question I put to Mr.
Kerr.
Xf your client had. consented to the forum clause
and gone into the British court, would there be any proceed­
ings in the federal courts in this country at all?
MR. NANCE:

Your Honor, if we had submitted our­

selves over there, if we had, we have a right still to sue
over here

31

QUESTION: Well, this is hypothetical.

Would there

have been any occasion for Tfnterweser to go into the courts
of the United States, if you had complied with the forum
clause of the contract, and let this matter he resolved in the
British court?
MR. NANCE; Well, I don't believe they would have
done

it, your Honor, no, sir, if we ruled that litigating.

That case is not even at issue.

There's been nothing done

about that case, no depositions taken.

It is just sittincr

there.
QUESTION:

It is conceivable that they might have

filed a salvage claim in the court in Florida, because that
is wholly unrelated and did not involve any dispute arising
under the contract.
MR. NANCE;

Well, they could have filed it

wherever

they could find Sapata which is at Houston? that's where their
base is.
QUESTION: Mr. Nance, whe.t do you say Hnterwaser
should have dona in order to reserve its right, after your
client has the ship arrested in Tampa?

you feel apparently

they did more than they ought to have in order to reserve
their rights to go to 'London.
What do you think they should have done?

What

should Unterweser have done after your client had the ship
arrested in Tampa, and in order to fully preserve its right

32
to this action and still not avoid a waiver of its claim, to
have it submitted to the High Court of London?
QUESTION?

You may answer that question right

after lunch.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.m. the same day.)

33
AFTERNOON SESSION
[Is00 p„sn.}
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Nance, you may now

address yourself to Mr. Justice Rehnquist*s question, if you
wish.
Q

Would it be of any help, Mr. Nance, if I «—

MR. NANCE:
Q

If you would repeat it, yes, sir.

— triad to restate it or rephrase it?

It is ray understanding that the proceedings in the
federal court wore instituted by your client, by the arrest
of the tug when it arrived, and that your position is that as
a result of subsequent actions taken by Unterweser in that
action they have somehow waived their claim to assert the
forum clausa? or at least they've submitted themselves to the
jurisdiction of that court.
My question is, assuming either that they have a
right to take whatever precautionary steps that they feel
are necessary to preserve their rights in the Tampa litigation,
in. ca.se they lose on this point’, what would you have them do
differently, so that you wouldn't say they had submitted them­
selves to the jurisdiction of the court?
MR, N&NCE's Well, I’ll try to answer it this way,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

Of course, as it was stated, they had

the — or previously they wanted to assert it, to assert their
limited

liability defense as to us in the first filed suit

34

by Zapata.
How, before they filed their limitation action on
July 2, this case had been pending several months.

&s I stated?

we were all litigating by taking depositions and so forth.
Counsel for Unterweser had all the opportunity in the world to
file a motion with the District Court and apprise them — Your
Honor, I need to know whether you're going to overrule my
motion ao to jurisdiction, or are you going to grant them?
Because I’ve got to make a decision whether or not 1 need to
file a limitation of liability proceeding.
y The docket entries in the record show that no such
motions were made# and I'm certain the District Court, like
any other judges, where he's apprised of a situation, would,
if such a motion had been presented, ha would have ruled on
these things in order to accord them the opportunity to do
one of two things then?

They could plead it defensively, if

he overruled their motion of jurisdiction? or, as they have a
privilege to do, and there are certainly under no legal
compulsion to do, they could have filed, which they did do#
the suit which is before this Court today.
Q

hid they assert lack of jurisdiction in their

answer?
MR, NANCE;
Q

Yes, Your Honor,

You say they should have done it by motion

rather than answer?

MR. NANCEi

Ho, sir.

The record shews that after

wo. filed our lawsuit, and depositions- had been taken, they
filed a motion to address the court’s jurisdiction, saying,
one, that it lacked jurisdiction because d? the forum clause.
Well, that was overruled partly because

private

parties cannot fashion their own private rules of jurisdiction.
Parties by contract cannot say what the federal court or what
the State court’s jurisdiction will be.

Either it’s taking

jurisdiction or as to the subject matter.
That was presented, and ultimately it was overruled.
In that proceeding they filed a motion to stay, and to decline
jurisdiction on the ground of forum non conveniens.
The court, on July 29th, after they had already filed
a limitation action on July the 2nd, overruled those motions.
So those motions were presented to the court, and he over­
ruled them.
So he has entered two orders in this court. Your
Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnguist:

an order overruling the motions

in Sapata * s first filed suit addressed to the jurisdiction;
and he’s overruled the motion to stay, which is what is before
this Court today.
0

Well now, you * re quite right that he could have

made these motions.

The question in this case is whether he

was required to make them in order to protect the position
which' he is row trying to protect.

Sometimes judges don't

3C
entertain motions very cheerfully if the motion is telling them
to get along and decide some matter.*
I-IR. NANCEi

Well, it .certainly was a motion that '

he could have made, and he did not, sc I couldn’t prejudge
what he did.

I just presumed that the court would move on

such a motion.
But f Your Honor, that begs the issue, I think,
because there is no .legal compulsion for him to file this
limitation liability proceeding.

He did it for two reasons:

one was to get the injunction out to stop the litigation in
the first filed suit of Zapata? secondly,,

as he claims in

his petition, he says, t fear the filing of other suits.
There were eight seamen on our rig, that this was a terrible
accident, they were flooded, the compartments, they were
sinking, they got off, they came back and pumped it out, and
so there were people who got hurt.
Ho says in the limitation proceeding:

I fear the

filing of other claims.
how, one of the purposes of a limitation proceeding
is, as held by the case I've cited in the brief, is to provide
a concourse not only for the claim; where he has sued us in
the limitation —■ because he did, he got admonitions to come
into this Court; but in. order to Bring into concourse the
claimtants who got hurt on the rig.

And by doing that, he

has only one, they get just one piece of pie they can slice:

the value of the tug, which is $1,390,000 he .re.
tod this is most important. Your Honor, if you read
Hartford Accident tk -indemnity Company, which says;

The purpose

of limitation proceedings, being an equitable one, is one to
bring all controversies into one, so that the court can
administer and dispose of a many-cornered controversy.
That case has been cited in the British Transport
case, saying, where they said a limitation proceeding is a
cross-libel against the claimants. And so, Your Honor, I
submit that he's not — he's invoked it,

it's here, I'll

admit there is nothing to keep him from claiming it.
Q

Well, Mr. Hence, do you suggest that his

position would have been any different had he dona this by
way of answer in your suit?
MR. NANCE:

He could have pled anything, Your Honor,

under —
Q

Well, would his position be any different?

MR. NANCE: The difference, Your Honor, would be that
if these eight seamen, Americans, sued him for Jones Act,
where they're a third-party case, of course if he hadn't filed
within six months *—
Q

You mean not filed his answer within six months,

or what?
nance:

We" 1, under the cases, Your Honor, he can

file his answer — under the cases I have cited in the brief,

38
he can file these at any time before they go to trial.

Like

any other defenser you've always got the question of motive,
and
Q

1 know, but X don't quite understand.

Perhaps

I didn't catch it, Mr. Nance, but 2 gather your position is
he may not now claim the benefit of the forum clause, because
of what he did in fighting the limitation suit?
MR. NANCE:

No, I want to get that straight.

He has the privilege, in addressing this equity
court, to say, Your Honor, in whatever state it is send
Zapata a way there.
X do not think it's a matter of lav?,

He's waived it.

The point is he has invoked and submitted himself to this
equitable court, asking for exoneration from liabilities not
only to us but to the world, and also saying *—
Q

Wall, from that —

MR. NANCE:
0

And so he's _____........

in court.

And from that you conclude that he may not now

insist on sending Zapata to Tampa.,
MR. NANCE:

isn't that it?

So he is in the interesting position

to say that ”1 here invoke the court's jurisdiction? and not
only that but I counterclaim and sue.”
0

And, Your Honor, I —

So you're saying that you have the right to

participate in his limitations actions in Tampa?
right to assert your claim there?

You have a

39
MR, NANCE:

Yes# and I’m going to discuss that in

just a moment.
Q

Along with other claimants?

Along with other

claimants?
MR. NANCEs When X say what I think is the proper
interpretation of the

oh, is my light off?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Q

Well, Mr. Nance, —

MR, NANCEx
Q

Your light is on.

May I have five minutes, Your Honor?

Mr. Nance, I take it that if you lose on the

point you’ve been arguing, then you arrive at the question of
whether or not the forum clause is valid?
MR. NANCE:

• I want to get to that, and I would hope

you would give me five minutes, Your Honor? this is a — we've
been litigating this case for four years.

And I'm sorry.

I

mean? I think I could give my speech in thirty minutes.
X appreciate — and the Court should ask m© anything it wishes.

'tint X want to answer your question.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Under the circumstances,

we511 give you five more minutes, and enlarge Mr. Kerr's time
accordingly.
MR, NANCEs Thank

you,

1 want to — these two Supreme Court cases are not
in my brief, and one decided by Mr, Justice Douglas, Freeman
vs. S» Machina Company 'in 1943, that's 319 U.S. 448? where

40

this Court held that where a defendant filed a counterclaim,
he submitted

'**--* invoked the jurisdiction of the Court and

submitted himself for the purposes for which he was there,
0

Was there a —

MR, NANCE: There was not a forum clause, no, sir.
Q

Well, then, it doesn't help very much, does it?

MR. NANCE: Well, it does in this sense, tour Honor,
because it

we're not taking the position that the forum

clause has been — they're entitled to assert it, but the
limitation court sitting in equity had to take into
consideration all the factors, which I'm fixing to discuss on
the reasonableness of the forum clause in just a moment.
Q

You’d better get to that, then.

MR. NANCE:

All right, then.

The other case rolled upon in that case was
Merchants iHeat S' bight vs, James B. Clow &. Sons, 204 U.S. 286,
where the Court held that the filing of a counterclaim doesn't
that he waived all objections to the jurisdiction.

If it's

/

•.,ebC for that, it certainly won't say he's waived his right
to assert that we should ne sent somewhere, but the rationale
of that case is overbearing.
Now, X want to «tiros3 myself now, quickly, to the
forum clause, which reads: "Ary dispute arising must be
treated before the London C:urt of Justice."
A forum clwn»e

..s stl'ivtly construed in this Court

41
in the Carbon Black-Monrosa case cited in the brief?

here

the elected clause was drafted by the German company, having
usually put the exclusive jurisdiction provisions in it.
They did not in this case. And we submit — and we've got it
fully briefed here — that that forum clause, being non­
exclusive in nature, .should not be to bar or preclude
Sapafca. from prosecuting its counterclaim in this suit.

X

think the Court is called upon to pass upon that.

How, turning to this questions

The weight of

authority in this country is that forum clauses are unenforcible.
Ml cases hold that they are voided against public policy,
in so far as they attempt to deprive or defeat any court of
its j urisdiction.
There are a line of cases, referred to as the modern
rule, starting in the Second Circuit with w i 111 am.

XI..

Mu .1 let

and others cited in the brief here, which say that under
appropriate set of circumstances a court may decline to
assert' its- jurisdiction in a case where there is a forum
clause involved.
And they look at these factors, and Mr. Kerr, in
urging this upon the Court, said to the Court, among other
factors you. car. consider is whether or not the plaintiff -—
we were plaintiff there at that stage — would be deprived
of his remedy if he wore relegated to the foreign court.
In the Third Circuit, after — in the Second Circuit,

42
after this reasonable — the forum clause may be enforced if
reasonable; the cases in there held in situations cited in the
brief that where the plaintiff would be deprived of his
remedy in the jurisdictional forum,stipulated forum, that in
that instance that is a proper consideration, and that they
could keep the case.
How, the reasonableness of this thing, an& we have
covered this clearly, where they include nationality of the
parties, place of performance of contract, deprivation of
remedy, and then the balance of convenience of the trial.
How, I hope I can clear this in one moment*
Th© trial court found that the balance of convenience
is strong in his forum.

All the evidence off Zapata's liability

and damages is in America by form of depositions off 40
witnesses, total, because a tremendous amount of repair and
liability went into thin.
th©

t, as to

where it was surveyed.

All the evidence as; to the German,
lowing line that broke, is in Florida,

The salvage suit testimony has been

taken, by deposition, as to the services that were done,
That’s preserved in the depositions in Florida.
The only thing,that would be left to calculate would
be the hire off the. tug, which -it "didn't get because it didn't
finish the voyage.
1 think it’s most important that this Court, in
deciding the case, that I do believe you would find that, from

43
that standpoint, that the .forage clause is not ®nforcible,
ipso factos no case holds that.

They all say the Court

must look at all the circumstances, and we detailed very
mush in our brief all of those things, and there is a fact
finding by the Court that the balance of convenience is
strongly there.
This is equity court, he exercised his best judgment,
for what ha should do under the circumstances, and I don’t
think that Unterweser has shown to this Court any abuse of that
discretion.
X thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

Thank you.

Mr. Kerr.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT CF DAVID C. G. KERR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KERR:

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the

Court s
I have several factual points that I think should
b® cleared up that ware raised by questions from the Court.
But, first of all, in order to decide what the lower court,
the District Court, determined or held with respect to our
motion, our original motion filed in the initial action to
sr.tay this proceeding and have it referred to the London Court,
you must go to the court's original order, which, as I think
has L.aah pointed out, was filed or submitted or -entered some•

44
si2« months

after our motion was originally filed.
And in that order the District Judge committed what

we think is the fundamental error in this case, with respect
to how he approached the case,

tod he held, and I'm reading

from page 82 of the Appendix, which is Judge Krentsman*s
order of July 29, 1968, and I*ih reading from the next to last
paragraph on that page, and the last sentence of that
paragraph.

We think this is crucial to show the misunderstanding

that the court had of this entire issue.
"The balance of conveniences hare is not strongly
in favor of defendant” — that being Zapata — "and Plaintiff's
choice of Forum should not be disturbed.”
This means that as of that date, with the initial
action filed, the District Court found that the balance of
convenience was in Unterweser's favor, although not strongly,
and then it went on to say;
should not be disturbed.”

"and Plaintiff's choice of forum
Which is of course applying the

forum non conveniens rule.
But the difference between the forum non conveniens
rule, the critical difference and the difference between the
choice of forum situation is that the initial choice of forum
is not the District Court intent, the initial choice of
forum here is London.
So he first of all found that the balance of
conveniences were in favor of Unterweser, and then he said,

45
he applied the presumption that Zapata's choice of forum was
Tampa, which of course it was nots

by contract its choice of

forum was London from the yery beginning»
X make that point because I think it is critical
to the decision of this case»
How,, there were several factual points, X think, that
should be cleared up,

Mr. Justice White, you asked whether —

you asked Mr. Nance whether or not insurance was mentioned or
discussed.
Mr. Nance

incorrect when he said it was not.

Insurance was mentioned.

In the original telegraphic bid,

sent by Unterweser to Zapata, in response to a solicitation for
bids which appears on page 295 of the Appendix.

Unterweser

agreed or offered to arrange for insurance for Zapata,
And then subsequently in the towage contract, Clause
2(b) —- and the towage contract appears at several points in
this Appendix, but the one I'm referring to is on page 72.
In the towage contract it was stipulated that insurance would
ha for the account of the owner? that is, the owner of the
tow, Zapata.
So insurance was mentioned, and the decision to go
uninsured was here a decision made by choice, by Zapata.
So 1 don't feel that that really has, as far as saying it is
here uninsured, it was given the opportunity to get insurance,
it was told that insurance would be for its account? so

46
insurance was discussed by the parties and was mentioned in the
documents.
The second factual point is with respect to all of
these depositions.

It is true that a lot of depositions were

noticed initially when the tug first arrived in Tampa d© bene
esse.

We moved for protective orders twice.

In the second

protective order* when we were aware of all the facts and
had consulted.'.' with cur German clients, we specifically pointed
out that this cause might well he tried in London»

hxia there­

fore some of the discovery that, taken here, might well have
to foe repeated.
But the court ordered us to go ahead and we then
also engaged in discovery depositions, one© the court had sard
that it was not impressed with our argument; and, in any event,
we feal this is immaterial because we have stipulated that
all the discovery undertaken in the United States will be
admissible in th© London action subject to the ordinary rules
of evidence.
you say "we have stipulated", have both

q

parties agreed?
MS, KERR;
Q
kr.

We have offered this.

Oh, you have offered it?
KERR*

yes*

We have stipulated unilaterally»

Mr. Chi©£ 3uatice.

q

What did you any, -Mr. Kerr, was the status of

47
■that London proceeding?
MR. KERR: The London proceeding, of course, Mr.
*

Justice Brennan, is stayed by injunction, the parties have been
anjoined by the District Court from proceeding, which raises
the next point I wanted to mention.
The reason that ail the issues are not pending in
London is not because they could not be presented through
appropriate pleading in London, but it is because the District
Court has enjoined us as parties from moving forward with that
action«
Q

Well, let's assume you win this case, are you

going to abandon your limitations action?
MR, KERRs

Abandon the limitation action in the U.S.?

X suspect we will, Mr. Justice White, because then, under
English law, we will be compelled, as scon as Zapata makes
its claims against us in the English action, we are then
compelled by English law to assert English limitations.
Those are their rules.
Q

Well, X know, but do you think you can fores

other claimants to go to England?
MR, KERR:

So far as X know there are no other —

Well, let's assume some other claimant came

in hero, into this limitations action, you couldn't terminate
it then, could you?
MR.KERR:

No, sir.

'And of course those claimants

48
would not be bound by the forum provision, either.
Q

No, that's what I say.

MB.» KERR:
0

That's right.

And I suppose you're interested in foreclosing

other claimants?
MR. KERR:
Q

Yes, sir.

And if they don’t come into this limitations

action here in the United States, they are foreclosed, aren't
they?
MR. KERR: That is correct.

That's mv understanding

of the law.
Q

So my question again to you is:

are you going

to abandon your limitations action if you win this lawsuit?
MR. KSRR:

If we win this lawsuit, we would ask, as

we did, have already asked in the limitations action, that our
action bo stayed in the United States —
Q

Be stayed but not abandoned?

MR. KERR:

No, sir.

And the reason for that is that

wo have

one of the concerns hero, concerns in some of the

cases is:

whafc about Sapata's security?

After all, they

brought cm in r&m suit, and the purpose for bringing an in ram
suit is to obtain security.

And we did post security.

And

we posted a bond on the limitation action.
One of the reasons that action in Tampa would remain
on file 1® because we have offered to make that security

49

available to Eapata, not remove it.
Q

Well, your claim in the limitations action is

that every claimant except Sapata should be able to litigate
in that action against Unterweser?
MS. KERR:

That is correct.

That.8s the purpose of a

limitation action.
Q

But you say that for one claimant the forum

clause procludes his filing a claim?
MR. KERR?

2 say that the claimant that is subject

to a forum provision must litigate where the contract calls
for.

Obviously, we can’t bind people that weren’t parties to

■the contract.
Q

But you gave Sapata notice, though, X suppose?

And got an injunction against their lawsuit?
MR. KERR:
suit»

We got a restraining order of the initial

This is the traditional form that a limitation action

can take.
Q

2 know, but didn’t they get a notice and an

invitation or a direction to file their claim?
MR. KERR: And they did; yes, sir.
And they filed their claim in that, and that
action of course has all the issues pending in it that pended
in the original action.
Q

Mr. Kerr, 1 suppose there’s at least several

practical presumptions that if no other claimants have appeared

50
on the scene since the time of the accident, there probably are
no other claimants, is there?
c*

ME. KERR:

I think at this point that's a safe

assumption,. Mr. Justice Rehnguisfc,

It was not necessarily a

safe assumption at the time that this action was originally
filed.
We don't know whether there have been any settled
or anything?
MR. KERR:
Q

Not to ray knowledge, no, sir.

Is this situation different with respect to

colloquy you have been engaging in from what it would be if,
instead of a forum clause for the British courts, you had a
different type of forum clause with arbitration, binding
arbitration of a fixed kind, the American Arbitration
Association or whatnot?

KIR. KERR:

Mr. Chief Justice, evidently there would

be a slight distinction as a matter of law, because it appears
that arbitration clauses now are generally recognised and
enforced.

We submit, and we have argued in our briefs, that

there is no logical reason for making a distinction between
an arbitration clause, calling for arbitration in London or
>

any other forum, and a contractual forum provision.

And. that's

been fully argued, I believe, by both parties.
But there would be that slight distinction in law,
because I think generally arbitration clauses are enforced

51
without any exceptions nowadays.
0

Well, I'm not so sure that that's true.

There

have been recent cases which have failed to recognise
arbitration clauses, with finality, and elimination of judicial
review.

But that’s not really relevant.
MR. KERF.i

I wasn’t referring to the recognition as

far as the results or what the review might be, X was referring
to the fact that arbitration clauses, calling for arbitration
in a foreign forum,

are generally recognised and enforced

to that extent.
One important factor that we also want to make very
clear is with respect to the limitation action.

We were faced,

of course, with the -— where, the moment that action is filed
in admiralty, a claim in this country, limitation, a
petition for limitation or the party defendant seeking
limitation, this is almost an inevitable consequence of that
action.
So that we had to protect our security in this
country.

We had $3.5 million security.

So what we did was a

reactional protective measure, to avail ourselves of a
protective device at a time when the court had not yet ruled
on our original motion,

And therefore we reasserted in that

petition, as I’ve indicated before, and this is in the
Appendix, we reasserted the paramountcy of our forum provision
and the motion for stay.

32
Q

Could you have done the same thing , Mr* Kerr.*

by answer in the Tampa suit?
MR, KERR; We suggest, Mr. Justice Brennan, no? for
two reasons.
our security.

Ho. 1, we would not have had a protection of
We might then be called upon to post security,

if any other actions were filed. And secondly, and perhaps more
importantly, there is doubt in the law at the present time,
and we cited the cases and the comment by Gilmore s> Black on
that point, there is doubt at the present time whether
defensive limitation is permissible after the six months have
expired.
And that comas about as the Morro Castle amendment
in 1937, when the six-month provision was first introduced in
the law.

And it's not entirely clear at this point, in the

decisions since then, whether you can file defensive limita*"
hion after the expiration of the six months.
In any event, what Sapata argues is that in the
limitation proceeding we ara invoking the benefit of the
limitation action.

The privilege, as they put it.

You

invoke that by answer or by petition, so you*re subject to the
same objections.
There has been an urging here with respect to Carbon
Black, and our forum provision in this case is governed by
Carbon Black, There are several distinctions there, made in
the brief, but the principal ones are;

in Carbon Black, the

53
forum clause related only to actions against the master, owner,
or agent.

That is, it was, per se, stipulated who could not he

sued.
And the Fifth Circuit seised upon that to say that
this was directed to in per sonars suits, and not at in rear suits.
So that9a one distinction.
The second distinction is that Carbon Black is a
Carriage of Goods by Soa Act case, and therefore governed by
the provisions of that federal statute.
And that does make a difference, and that difference
X think is sufficiently discussed in the briefs.
Q

Do you think the forum clause would have

prevented you from bringing.a. limitations action in Tampa?
MR. KERR:

Yes, sir.

I think the forum clause

compelled us to go to London for all remedies available in
London, including limitation, and not in the

U. s.

In so far as Zapata Is concerned, Mr. Justice White?
now, .if there is a suit by a third person, not subject to
the provisions of the towage contract, obviously we could
file limitations —
Q

Well, let's assume somebody, soma other claimant

had arrested this shipment in Tampa, and sued you, and you
brought r limitations action.
including Sapata.

And you noticed all claimants,

Could you do that under the limitations

'clausa? ....................................................

54
MR. KERRi

Yes P sir.

And I think the limitations

court should say that since Zapata is compelled by contract
to.file its claim in London, they may file their claim in.
London.
Q

They may# but. —

MR, KERRs They can.

Or should.

Just like Unterweser would have to file its
limitation claim in so far as Zapata is concerned in London,,
because the contract is binding only on those two? rot on the
seamen that traveled on the CHAPARRAL.
0

You don't think you could make Zapata come

into the limitations action if it had been filed in the
circumstances X have posed?
MR. KERRs

No, sir, because it would have been a

limitation action pending in London, presumably.
0

Mr. Kerr, what's —

Q

Well, not if Zapata hadn't sued you there?

MR. KERR*

No.

Obviously, if Zapata hadn't sued

us there there would be no limitation action in London. But
if the contract had been complied with, the full, all of the
issues in this cause, including limitation£ would have been
before the London High Court of Justice.
Q

Well, put it this ways

What if, on my

assumptions, some other claimant had sued you and you had filed
th® limitations action, and Zapata had filed its claim there.

2ind you had objected to it?
Could you have done it?
MR» KERR: Successfully?
Q

Successfully?
I think we could have.

Sven though some other claimant arrests the

ship, you file limitations action in response to that, and
then Zapata files its claim along with other claimants, you
would gay you could make Zapata go to London to litigate his
claim?
MR. KERRs

Yes, sir.

Because we would net have filed

the limitations —
Q

1 guess you have to say that, in your position,

don’t you?
MR. KERR: Well, I feel I do, because
Q

Yes.

MR. KERR:

«— because the action

there would have

been a limitation action pending in London, presumably.
This could only have happened if Zapata had gone to London,
and they would have been engaged in all the issues in London.
Q
just ask this:

Mr. Kerr, I know your time is up, but may X
What’s the difference between this $8,000 fund

that Mr. Nance mentioned and what would be available here?
MR. KERRs This is just a difference in the limitation
funds in the two countries.

The limitation fund in Great

Britain is smaller than the limitation fund in the U.S.

Q

Well, is it as small as $8,000?

Q

It's eighty.

MR. KERR:
Q

Oh, eighty?

MR. KERR;
Q

— yes, sir.

/ind what's the amount here?

MR. KERR:
0

It's eighty thousand,. 2 believe —

It's —

8300-odd?

MR. KERR:

— one million three ninety; which is

presently the established value of the BREMEN at the present
-- the juncture of the proceedings we’re in.
