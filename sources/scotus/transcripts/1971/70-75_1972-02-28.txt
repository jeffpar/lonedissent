PROCE E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 70-?5, Moose Lodge against Irvis.
MR. WIENER:

Mr. Chief Justice--»

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Would you just suspend

for one moment, Mr. Wiener.
Mr. Wiener, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK RERNAYS WIENER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. WIENER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The substantive issue in this case is whether
anything in the Constitution of the United States requires
the virtual destruction of private clubs in this country.
But before I can reach that question, the rules require
that I reach the jurisdictional issue which tie Court
postponed.

Before I can usefully do either, l must briefly

sketch the facts.
The appellant, Moose Lodge, is a private club in
every respect, and the parties have so stipulated in
detail.

It has selective and invitational membership

procedures.

Admission to the clubhouse is restricted to

members and their guests.

It has never received and ;u«n't

now receiving any public funds.
iocubed on public property.

This clubhouse is not

It performs no public functions.

4
It conducts no community activity.

It has never asked for

public assistance either from courts or police in the
conduct of its affairs.
It has never sought; public patronage through
advertising.

It is not a recent transformation.

no sham or subterfuge here.

There is

It is a non-profit corporation

controlled by its membership, and the objects of its
bounty are Moose House, which is an orphanage and school,
and Moose Haven, which is a home for the elderly.
Here is all that Moose Lodge receives from public
bodies.

It has an occupancy permit for its building.

has an operating permit for its elevator.
permit for its restaurant.

It

It has a health

It gets also what every private

resident within the city limits gets—water, steam heat, and
trash removal, for which it pays.

And it has a club

liquor license from the Commonwealth.
Moose Lodge’s membership is restrictive as is
that of other clubs and organizations in this country that
include more than 70 million Americans.

Restrictions are,

first, mala; second, Caucasian and not married to a non™
Caucasian; third, belief in the Supreme Being.
I had better read from the Court's findings as to
how this case arose.
"A Caucasian member in good standing brought
plaintiff, e, Negro, to the Lodge’s diningroom and bar as

5
his guest and requested service of food and beverages.

The

Lodge, through its employees, refused service to plaintiff
solely because he is a Negro.

Thereupon, the plaintiff*

Mr. Irvis, who is the Majority Leader of the Pennsylvania
House of Representatives, brought this actio:

against the

Moose Lodge and the members of the Pennsylvania Liquor
Control Board, alleging the unconstitutionality of the
Pennsylvania Liquor Code as applied because it did not
prohibit the issuance of club licenses to clubs with racial
membership restrictions."
The three-judge court held that liquor regulation
by Pennsylvania was so pervasive that Moose Lodge's
membership restrictions were 'thereby transformed into state
action.

But it made a significant qualification which I

had better read in preference to characterising.

This is

from page 40 of the appendix.
"Nothing in what we hare say implies a judgment
on private clubs which limit participation to those of a
shared religious affiliation or a mutual heritage in
national origin.

Such cases are not the same as the

present one where discrimination is practiced solely on
racial grounds," and the judgment was that either the
Moose Lodge had to drop its racial restrictions or else
lose its liquor license.
Moose Lodge moved to modify that judgment so as to

6
permit Mr. Irvis guest privileges.
was denied by the Board.

He opposed that.

It

This appeal followed and Your

Honors postponed jurisdiction.

Under the rules, I must

argue that jurisdictional point first.
Q

What specifically was Moose Lodge's motion

to amend the judgment?
MR. WIENERs

Where in the record is that?
That is at page 42 of the appendix.

There is an answer at page 44, and the motion was denied.
Q

The effect of it would have been to-—

MR. WIENERs

Permit any member to bring Mr. Irvis

in as a guest.
Q

Only Mr. Irvis?

MR. WIENER:
Q

Anybody similarly situated.

Anybody similarly situated.

MR. WIENERs

Yes.

Now, one of the points on which we agree with
Irvis is that the complaint did indeed state a cause of
action within the jurisdiction of the three-judge court,
because it was an action to enjoin statewide legislation on
the ground that as applied it denied the plaintiff the
equal protection of the laws.

It was not like that Texas

University case where the legislation wasn't c£ statewide
application.

It. wasn't like that Native American Church

case where some of the members of the court couldn't find
an allegation of unconstitutionality.

Here that allegation

7

1

was made»

don't think it would be profitable or helpful

to the Court for me to discuss the cases in detail.' They
are all set out in our brief.
We think that even though jurisdiction originally
attached—-ands of course,- the touchstone is the complaint-it was thereafter lost, and. it is our view that there is
no present case or controversy because the decree gives
Irvis no personal redress but, to the contrary, is a
judgment punitive in character and legislative in its
application.
It was stipulated that the loss of a liquor
license would seriously impair Moose Lodge’s ability to
contribute to the benevolent purposes of the Supreme Lodge»
Irvis didn't ask for damages.

He didn't sue as a taxpayer.

He didn't bring a class action.

He doesn't seek membership.

He repeatedly conceded here and below the right of the
Moose Lodge to exclude him.

And he repeatedly said there

was nothing illegal in its doing so.

And he rejected

modification of the judgment which would have let him in
as a guest.

So that all he wants is to have the Moose

Lodge lose its liquor license, and we say he has no personal
stake in that anymore than any of the other 12 million
inhabitants of the Commonwealth.
Q
controversy?

You are saying there is no longer a case or

8

MR. WIENER:

Yes, Your Honor.

And having done on;: duty by raising the
jurisdictional question, I pass to the substantive issues.
But by way of essential preliminary I must deal with the
District Court8s suggestion, that there is somehow a.
difference between racial restrictions, on tie one hand,
and religious or ethnic restrictions on the other.

How,

that, to put it most gently, is completely mistaken.
There is no constitutional distinction whatever
between state action that discriminates either
or religious or ethnic grounds.

or

racial

It is simply not true

that the Constitution sustains the anti-semite while
denouncing the anti-Hamite.

It is simply net true that

some groups are entitled to more equal protection than
others.
What this purported distinction really does is
a picking and choosing among associations and groups on the
basis of their beliefs and preferences which seems to me

a most glaring denial of due process, because all three
restrictions are equally bad if the membership requirements
are indeed state action.

And, interestingly enough, that

is one of the few points on which the Attorney General of
Commonwealth agrees with us.

He says they are all

equally bad.
Therefore, if the private club with the racial

9
restriction can't have a liquor license because those
restrictions are state actiont then neither can any other
private club with religious cr ethnic distinctions»

So

that if the judgment below is correct? scores of millions
of Americans now associated in all manner of private clubs
can’t have liquor licenses either»

And since precedents

invariably build on each other, the next will, be they will
risk losing building permitsr restaurant permits, and all
the rest»

Irvis says they are all different, but there is

i Maine statute that makes the racially restrictive club
lose its restaurant permit also while not taking it away
from, the religiously or ethnically restrictive club.
Fortunately for the continued pluralistic
existence of the Republic, and the Elks’ brief amicus
documents the statement that we are indeed a nation of
joiners, the decision below is wrong for three separate
reasons which 1 shall discuss in order.
First, the First Amendment right of associational
privacy protects private clubs and fraternal organisations
from any and all state effort directed at the full exercise
and enjoyment of that right.
Second, the issuance of a liquor license does not.
and cannot transform the acts of the licensee into those of
the licensing authority.
A?d, three, Congress in

the Civil lights Act of

.10
1964 has twice drawn a line between these apparently
competing constitutional rights by excepting from the
public accommodations title private clubs not in fact open
to the public and by forbidding the Civil Rights Commission
from investigating the membership practices and the
internal operations both of private clubs and of fraternal
organizations.

And I will take first the right of

associational privacy which, it seems to us., can be viewed
either negatively or affirmatively»
Negatively it is the proposition that social
rights are not enforceable in the courts or by law; and for
this proposition I draw on the dissenting opinion of the
Elder Justice Harlan in the civil rights cases.

I had

better give that citation because it3s not in the brief.
109, 0» S., at 59.
“I agree that government has nothing to do with
social as distinguished from technically legal rights of
individuals.

No government has ever brought or ever can

bring its people into social intercourse against their
wishes.

Whether one parson will permit or maintain social

relations with another is a matter with which government
has no concern.
"X agree that if one citizen chooses not to hold
:ocial intercourse with another, he is not and cannot be
.

-I- amenable to law for his conduct in that regard.

For

11
vva::. upon grounds of raeo ic legal right of a citizen is
violated by the refusal of others to maintain merely
social relations with him."
That,, as I have indicated, is the dissenting
opinion.

But it is in an area where the dissents of the

Elder Justice Harlan have now more weight than those of the
Court.
Affirmatively there is a right of—a constitutional
right of liberty of association which is documented by
many decisions of this Court and which amounts to this,
that in my home and in my club and in my choice of business
associates I can act on my prejudices, even those of race.
My preferences may bs enlightened, they may be eccentric,
they may be bigoted, they may represent prejudices, they
may represent postjudices.

5 at in my private domain X can

exclude whom I want and for any reason.

And as indicated

therb is no doubt here about the.—
Q

Wouldn’t the logical conclusior from that

affirmative statement of the right of privacy be that the
state couldn't choose to prohibit the type of discrimination
that was found here?
MR. WIENER3

X think very clearly so.

The analogy

that we used in the brief was the doctrine c£ unconstitu­
tional conditions.
■tvitutas.

Your Boner will recall anti-removal

b&si .; the rat ionale, for striking down those

12
statutes was that the state cannot Interfere with the
exercise of the federally guaranteed right»

So that the

answer is—the short answer, Your Honor, is yes.
can't interfere.

The state

The right to pick one's associates from

among those like-minded? is an area beyond governmental
cognisance and the result below really strikes a wounding
blow at human privacy.
Q

You wouldn't carry that to the extent of

saying it would be illegal for Pennsylvania to deny a
liquor license to establishments that discriminate?
MR. WIENER;

If they’re private, I would.

Oh,

definitely, definitely? because if it’s private, you can
discriminate.

If it is a public place, no, clearly not.

But this is private.
home»

The club is just an e?tension of the

In ?3van-g v» Newton the Court said that if you have

a golf club that’s all white or a golf club that’s all
black, that’s the right of private association.

But if you

have a municipal golf course, then you can't discriminate.
So, I would say as long as it is private, the
state can no more lift the license of Moose because it is
limited to Caucasians only or to those who aren't agnostics
or atheists than it. can lift the license of the Knights of
Columbus Council, which is restricted, I am told, to
practicing Catholics, or the liquor license of the Knights
Peter CXaver, who are black, male, and Catholic.

So that

13
if it is a bona fide privata club—of course, I am
excluding the shams and the subterfuges and—
Q

So, you would treat the liquor license like

water or electricity?
MR. WIENERs

X would.

There isn't much difference

because, Your Honor, once you say the liquor is special,
we get to the restaurant license.

Now, my brother says

the restaurant license is different.
says no.

The State of Maine

Irvis in his last brief espouses the proposition

from a recent three-judge court case that anybody who
discriminates can't have solace from the government.

That

means that where you cut off the water, because how many
homes in this country get water from other than public
bodies, and you would cut off power in large parts of the
west, urban and rural, because of the vast proliferation
of municipal power plants.

So that if you can cut off a

liquor license, you can step by step cut off all the rest
if you agree with the three-judge District Court that no
discrimination can receive any solace.

And I want to

emphasize there is no difference between racial, religious,
or ethnic.

After all—
Q

Is this position essential to your prevailing

in this case?
MR. WIENER?

Well, X have three positions.

And

:: second one is, which r?.11—one is the affirmative right

14
to privacy and the inability :>£ law or government to dictate
social relations.

The second proposition for reversal is

that the issuance of the license doesn't transform or
transmute or metamorphose the acts of the licensee into
those of the licensor.
1 want to emphasise the shaky and i. ideed sandy
foundation on which the notion of state action was erected
in this case.

A Caucasian member in good standing brought

plaintiff^ a Negro, to the Lodge's diningroom and bar as
his guest and requested service of food and beverages.

The

Lodge,, through its employees, refused service to plaintiff
solely because he was a Negro.
Well, this is an action against the Liquor Control
Board to lift the liquor license.

What did tie Liquor

Control Board have to do with the refusal to serve food?
And there is nothing in this finding by the Court that
says that the Commonwealth had anything'to do with this
refusal of.-service.

Because, after all, you can hardly

exist nowadays without some kind of—a whole series of
licenses from state, and federal authorities.

If I may interject a personal note, I need four
licenses to be here at this lectern speaking so Your Honors.
First 1 had to be admitted to a state court.
be admitted here.

Then I had to

Then I had to be admitted in the District.

And now every year X have to pay a professional license fee

15
to the District to be able to practice my profession and
gain my livelihood.

If you drive an auto on the highway,,

you need a driving license, you need a car registration,
and in many, perhaps most, states you need an annual safety
inspection.
If you operate a teetotaler club o:. a locker system
club, you need an occupancy permit, an elevator permit, and
a restaurant permit.

Those essential licenses' don't turn

the lawyer or driver into a public utility who is required
to serve all comers.

And those licenses don't turn a

private club into a place of public accommodation.
Q

If your adversary is correct, Mr. Wiener, in

your view is the so-called bottle club in the same category
as the licensed liquor dispenser?
MR. WIENER;

I am told that having a locker system-

that is, every member having his stick a stock of liquor in
your locker, not selling liquor, not buying liquor from the
club—that that would not require a liquor license.
Q

But the state has a monopoly on the liquor

and it's selling it, isn't it?
MR. WIENERs

Yes, hut the state doesn't say that

if you buy a bottle of DM Oberholt and take it to your home
you can't exclude people you don't like.

Q

I know it. doesn't say that, but it is neverthe­

less selling the liquor to enliven a party that may

Well, that’s the extent to which

state action here.

And we think there just isn’t any
And as I've said, if any benefit is

the touchstone, nobody can have electric licit or electric
power if you are going to discriminate in your home.
Q

Isn't your argument really that there may be

state action but there is no state action that denies
equal protection of the law?
MR. WIENER;

Exactly.

In other words, the

position that we take on that, is the position that Your
Honor and Justice Black and Justice Harlan took in Bell
against Maryland, that you can't attribute to the licensing
authority discriminatory acts on the part of licensees.
It's too big a jump.
Q

Mr. Wiener, you have said that Pennsylvania

doesn't call for any license of a so-called locker club.
Are there some states that dc require it?
MR. WIENER;

Your Honor, I am not an expert on

liquor regulation in the several states.

But if you say

■Ard:. St-imsylvenia is so pervasive, you are going to have to

17
test the other 50 states to eae whether there is a
difference.,
Hie notion that the Court below espoused that
liquor regulation was more continuous than other regulations,
the bar isn't regulated any more continuously than the
restauranto

And as far the so-called pervasive regulation,

what is pervasive?
building codes.

Look at building codes; look at

This is the Pennsylvania Liquor Code.

This is the Building Officials' Conference of America—BOCA—
ba@!c building code.

My figures are that some 800

municipalities have adopted these codes in whole or in
part.
Howf 1 don't think that one is more pervasive than
the other, and I think you're going to have an awful time
if you are going to try to compare every area of regulation
against liquor regulation to see whether one is or is not
pervasive.

1 just think that to say that the pervasiveness

of a regulation transforms the acts of the licensee into
those of the licensing authority is just to rewrite the
Constitution.

The Constitution says no state shall deny

to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the law,

It doesn't say no person licensed by a. state,

it doesn’t say no person pervasively licensed by a state,
■ indeed. Your Honors, our entire recent constitutional
od story warns against- toe great departures from the text*

Take liberty of contract.

What a sorry chapter that was

from Lochner v» New York through Moorehead against Pep® 11»
Or take the immunity of governmental instrumentalities
which emphasizes the value of looking to the text rather
than its exigesis.
Sir. Justice Frankfurter, when that, doctrine was
overruled, said this;

"The judicial history of this

doctrine of immunity is a striking illustration of an
occasional tendency to encrust unwarranted interpretations
upon the Constitution and thereafter to consider merely
what has been judicially said about the Constitution rather
than to be primarily controlled by a fair conception of the
Constitution.

Judicial exigesis is unavoidable with

reference to an organic act like our Constitution drawn in
many particulars with purposeful vagueness so as to leave
room for the unfolding future.

But the ultimate touchstone

of constitutionality is the Constitution itself and not
what we have said about it.™ And the Constitution says no
state.
The third ground for reversal is the congressional
action in the Civil Right;; Act of 196 4.
provisions.

There are two

First, is Section 203(e) which exempts from the

operation of the public accommodations title private clubs
vhat
■ -

e not in fact open to the public.

And then perhaps

ora sigaificantly, the Section 504 (a) which forbids

19

the Civil Sights Commission from examining the membership
practices and the internal operations of private clubs and
fraternal organisations.

&nd that is the commission, if

Your Honors please, that Congress directed to collect
information concerning the denial of equal protection and
they weren't to look into private clubs.
Congress, as the legislative history shows,
wanted to protect the constitutional right of private
association from interference: by the commission, and that's
clear from the legislative history.
Finally, there is a 13th Amendment, point which
has been raised.

Up to page 39 of his brief: here, Irvis

said, "The injury suffered by Irvis was not just that a
private organization, barred him because he was black.
xt was entitled to do,“

This

But 70 pages later he contends

that to have barred him was a badge or incidence of
slavery.

Well, now, that just doesn't wash because the

Moose restriction is Caucasians only.
Indians.

That .bars American

American Indians not only were nevsr systematically

enslaved but they had Negro slaves of £heir own, the
freedmen of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole Nation.
clearly Caucasians only is not a badge or incident
of slavery.
So that we say jurisdiction isn’t lost or if it
•■av.tt be regained by amendment, the judgment below must be

20
reversed with directions to dismiss for failure to state
grounds for relief.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Wiener.

Mr. Rubin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J. RUBIK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF X» LEROY XKVXS,et al.
MR. RUBIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Like Mr. Wiener, I would like to begin with a
brief discussion of the preliminary jurisdictional issue
which the Court has asked us to argue.

And I would like to

note, as Mr. Wiener did, that both parties are agreed that
three-judge court jurisdiction was proper in this case and
therefore approach the issue from another angle.

I would

like to approach it from the standpoint ©f what this case
is not with respect to the three-judge court problem, and
I would take my text from the citations which appeared just
a little over a month ago in this Court’s opinion in Board
of Regents, the citations twice, as I recall, to the case
of Phillips v. The United States or, I believe in this
Court, The United States v. Phillips, in which Justice
Frankfurter discussed the three-judge court problem in some
depth and pointed out that the touchstone in these cases
where we have legislative action or administrative action
is whether or not there has been some lawless exercise of

21
authority by some administrative agency of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania in this case or some state official in the
Phillips case.

And I think vhen you phrase or cast this

case in terms of whether or rot there has

cr has

not been

a lawless exercise of authority* you realise that this is
not the Phillips case..

This is a case in which the state-

liquor board, acting pursuant to powers granted to it only
by the state liquor code and acting strictly in accordance
with the provisions of that state liquor code, has granted
and renewed a license to a private club in conformity with
the provisions of that state liquor code.
Consequently, this case does not involve the type
of lawless, unauthorised administrative action which the
Court in the Phillips case held would preclude three-judge
court jurisdiction.
1 think it goes without saying, of course, that
this is not a case like Board of Regents.

This is not a

case in which only a purely local issue is involved.

This

is a case in which a statewide statute affecting statewide
policy of statewide application is presented to the Court.
X think we need not dwell on that particular aspect of the
three-judge court problem.
X would point out that this case gees further
an a case in the area of liquor regulation in which this
pheld three-judge court jurisdiction.

In the

22
case of Xdlewild v. Epstein,, the New York liquor case
involving the store, at the New York airport, the Court
upheld three-judge court jurisdiction there in an attack on
a special provision of the New York liquor law which
applied only to one particular complainant, the Idlewild
Liquor Shop at the New York airport, that shop claiming that,
it was not required to get a license because of its
peculiar operations in which it sold only to passengers in
foreign commerce.
Well, our case is much broader than that.

Our

case involves a statewide application of Pennsylvania's
liquor laws to hundreds of statewide and local club
organisations.

Consequently, if Phillips is good law,

if Idlewild is good law, if hoard of Regents is good law.
as 1 urge that they all are, then this case does present
a case for three-judge court jurisdiction and does present
a case for appeal to this- Court from the decision of the
court below.
Q

Could I ask you, what happened to the

litigation in the Pennsylvania courts?
MR. ROBIN:

Yes, Mr. Justice Whit*.

The

Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission—anc I speak only
from hearsay, we have nothing to do with that case nor did

ray client have anything to do with that case--the
ornsylvan!a Human Relations Commission itself brought an

23
action in -state courts seeking to hold that this private
club was in fact a place of public accommodation 1 believe
on the ground that because it allowed guests to enter it
should then be so held to that extent.
Q

Under the Pennsylvania law.

MR. RUBIN;

Under the Pennsylvania law.

That

case; that argument was rejected by the Court of Common
Pleas of Dauphin County in Harrisburg.

On appeal of the

Pennsylvania Superior Court it was again rejected, and
the decision of the court below was affirmed.

It was held

that this was not a place of public accommodation.
Q

Did it go to the Supreme Court?

MR. RUBIN;

I understand that the Human Relations

Commission has filed a petition to the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court requesting the Supreme Court to hear it and as best
1 know, no action has been taken on that petition.
Q

Sot that issue is still pending in Pennsylvania?

MR. RUBIN:

That issue would be considered still

pending.
Q

There was no constitutional issue involved in

that case?
ME. RUBIKs
Q

There was none.

Any issue under the state law as to whether or

not it's a place of public accommodation?
MR. RUBIN;

As the human Relations Commission has

24
brought it, under Pennsylvania's Human Relations Act»

Q
statute»

Right, X understand»

Under the state

And in this case, as I understand it further, it

is conceded that for purposes of the constitutional issue
before us that this is a bom. fide private club,
MR, RUBIN:

That is correct, Mr, Justice Stewart?

■we have uniformly taken that position from the beginning of
the case,
Q

Would this require art all-black club—

Mi. RUBIN:

I think an all-black club whose only

purpose was to provide social and fraternal amenities to
its membership would be in the same position,
Q

And—but you do—anything to do with rates.

How about an all-Italian club?
MR, RUBIN:

Mr. Wiener has raised She question

based on the lower court statement about ethnic clubs,
religious clubsf and we have answered it thi3 way at great
length in oar brief.
Q

Well, you just say no and—

MR. RUBIN;
White.

The answer is yes and no, Mr. Justice

And the answer is this way.

There are bona fide

private clubs whose purposes involve ethnic distinctions.
That is, in the brief that has been filed by the Elks there
■ii/.e

xr

ter ally hundreds of clubs of, say, ethnic Americans

who are together in private organizations for the purpose of

25
furthering their ethnic histories, their ethnic traditions,
their ethnic backgrounds.
once we have

If that club is 3>;.>na fide and

passed the special scrutiny that race

requires in these matters, than there is no reason why that
club cannot discriminate or. those grounds as we see it,
because the purpose of the discrimination is a rational one;
it is not what this Court has called invidious discrimination.,
It is true they may exclude someone who is not
of that ethnic origin.

But the purpose of the club being-

in existence is a reasonable one.

It is not. just a social

purpose,
Q

What about all-male clubs?

MR. RUBIN:
0

All-male clubs?

Or all-women clubs?

MR. RUBINt

We still don’t have a constitutional

amendment, as I believe, forbidding discrimination on
grounds of aex,
Q

That’s the equal protection clause though.

MR. RUBIN:

As far as I know, there has been no

ruling on that point.
Q

What’s your position on it?

MR. RUBIN:
Q

On all-male clubs?

Yes.
RUBIN:

I would have to rely on the feeling

-hat since we do not yet have a constitution*

amendment

26
specifically stating that, the equal protection clause does
not provide that type of protection.
Q

So, that’s just across the 'board.

-Say a

restaurant refuses to—
MR. ROBINt
place.

Ho. a restaurant is normally a public

The person Who is entitled to go—
Q

So, the equal, protection clause would

protect-MR. RUBIN;

The restauranteur has waived any

rights to privacy.
Q

I’m just saying the women would, have an

equal protection claim there.
MR. RUBIN;
Q

Yes, in that respect.

I got interested years ago in the Moslem

religion and in Moslem churches around the vorld, but I
have never been able to get into the Black Moslem Church.
They always stopped me at the door.

Is that, unconstitu­

tional?
MR. RUBIN;

I would probably have to ask further

why you were stopped at the door.
Q

Because I was white.

Q

The answer is they're Muslims, not Moslems.

[Laughter]
iROBINj
lf

m-

Like Mr. Wiener in his discussion of

1 ** SOia» to have to retreat to the point of

27
saying X know little enough about 'that to try to expound
on the depths to which that, would go.

We know how far we

would go when we're .discussing this particular problem»

I

am not sufficiently familiar with the Black Muslims»
X do want to mention one other thing, however,
in connection with'the preliminary issues or what I would
call the preliminary issues, and that is this question of
whether there is or is not a case or controversy here»
Mr. Xrvis initiated this case seeking only one thing.

He

was only seeking to preclude the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
from giving solace or support or comfort to the
discriminating private club by issuing this liquor license
to it.

He never at any time requested membership in the

Moose Lodge because we respect the right of Moose Lodge
as a private club to determine its own membership
requirements.
He did not seek damages because the nature of
the deprivation that is involved here would make redress
by way of damages insufficient and inadequate.

This is a

continuing type of discrimination that takes place which
would involve the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania over and
over and over again.
Therefore, it seemed to us—and we assume the
lower court agreed*—that the proper redress here is to

ever the relationship between the discriminating private

28
clubs and common law.
Q

Would you say then that if he had never been

denied entrance to the club and nevertheless brought
this suit,, that he would have.; a proper case?
MR. RUBINt

Yes.

I think that result inevitably

follows. Your Honor.
Q

So that you*re saving that any black person,

any Negro, could have brought this suit and should be
given the standing to litigate this action.
MR. RUBINj

That's correct.

The problem would

then only be one of proof—-that is. Does the Moose Lodge
in fact exclude Negroes?
no proof problem.

There obviously would have been

Here our proof was supplied by the fact

that Mr. Irvis was excluded,so we didn't have that problem.
Q

His being denied entrance was just a way of

proving the discrimination.
MR. RUBINi

It was the catalyst which proved our

point.
Q

What about a white person raising the same

issue?
MR. RUBIN:

I think the white person who was the

member of the Moose Lodge—
Q

Any citizen could raise it, I suppose.

MR, RUBIN:

I'm not that certain.

I think that a

Iere person, any person who is discriminated against, has

29
a special standing*

Q

Whether he was discriminated against at the

-club or not, I take it.
MR. RUBIN:
Q

Yes, X think that’s true.

Did Mr. Irvis want his drink?

MR. RUBIN:
white member.

Mr. Irvis was taken to the club by a

They sat down at the bar.

X understand that

they requested food and beverage and were refused.
Q

Why is that not in the stipulations?

MR. RUBINs

I believe it is, Your Honor.

Q

Xs11 take your word for it if it is.

It is?

MR. RUBIN:

Yes, on page 32 of the appendix,

Mr. Wiener points out in the opinion of the Court food, and
beverage were requested.
Q

I just read the stipulation.

MR. RUBIN:
Q

Food and beverage were requested.

My whole point was all you want was to get the

liquor license.
MR. RUBIN:
Q

That’s correct.

And how much good will that do .It. Irvis?

MR. RUBII-I:

Xt will put Mr. Irvis in the position

of being a Negro citisen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
who knows that, a private club is not being aided by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in its discrimination.
Q

-Ihat about the restaurant license?

30

MRc RUBIH:

The re;: taurant license?

The

restaurant license like—and I would answer Mr. Justice
White’s point on this same thing—we think of the
restaurant license, the building permit, the supply of
water, the supply of electricity, as being in a totally
different category from this liquor license, and there are
several reasons for that.
First of all, the restaurant license, the building
permit, are supplied to the Moose Lodge as they are supplied
to any pub lie—any person, any organisation, for the
benefit of the public.

It’s for public health and safety.

They are open to all persons.

Water and electricity is

supplied to all persons generally.
government.
Q

The function of

The liquor license is not in that 'position.
X was talking about the restaurant license.

X didn’t say one mumbling word about—
HR. RUBIN:

The restaurant license, Mr. Justice

Marshall, as we understand it, is only a sanitary license.
That is, when we use the phrase "restaurant license," we
were talking only about that license which indicates that
the City of Harrisburg has inspected the restaurant
kitchen facilities and found them to be sanitary.
Q

And must continue to do it.

MR. RUBIN:

And must continue to do it.

But that

too is for the protection of the public, protection of those

31
persons who us

■■

the restaurant»

It is not the type of

license that has a special benefit to it.
Q

What I’m really driving at is the motion that

was made to modify.
MR. RUBINs

The motion that was made to modify

was a motion which would have allowed Mr. Irvis to he
admitted as a guest.
Q

And any others?

MR. RUBIN:
be any others.
Q

I would assume that it would have to

Mr. Wiener so stated.
Will you explain for me why you oppose the

motion to modify?
MR. RUBIN:

Yes•

I can answer both of those

questions I think at the same time.

The motion to modify

which would have allowed Mr. Irvis or any others to he
admitted as a guest would have done nothing to remove the
Commonwealth' of Pennsylvania from the discriminatory
.actions of the Moose Lodge.
That is, it still would have been a matter of
being dependent upon a white member of the Moose Lodge to
invite him there.

It will would have been a matter of no

particular Negro being sure that the Moose Lodge would or
would not discriminate.

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania

would still be issuing that license to a discriminating
v: v..i iai: >

iind I think it8 3 worth noting that at the

32

time this motion to modify was being presented, the Moose.
Lodge was in the process of amending its bylaws to forbid
Negroes from being guests.

So* at the same time they were

saying let us modify the decree so that we can admit
Mr. Irvis as a guest, their bylaws were being amended to
say no Negroes can come in as guests, let alone members.
We feel that the idea that he should then be
allowed to cams in as a guest through a modification of
the decree doss not go to the heart of the problem.

It.

does not supply the type of redress that we think cuts
through the- problem of state participation cr support for
the discrimination of the Moose Lodge, and that is why we
oppose it.
Q

If X understand Mr. Wiener correctly, at no

time did he ask to be a member.
MR. RUBIN:
Q

Legally or otherwise.

MR. RUBIN:
Q

That is correct.

That is correct,,

And this case has never been tried or the

membership point raised.
MR. RUBIN:
requested membership.

That is right.

We have never

We would not, request membership

because we respect the argument that the Moose Lodge a® a
private club is entitled to select its own members.
Q

But it can't serve liquor.

33
MR. RUBIN:

We are only asking that Pennsylvania's

liquor licensing participation he removed from whatever
Moose Lodge wants to do.

There have been references made

to the bottle club problem.

Like Mr. Wiener,,

1 would say in

Pennsylvania that does not pcae any issue of state
involvement at all.

A person can take a bottle to another

place * sit down with his friends, and have a drink of
liquor, if he wishes.
we have here.

But that is not the same thing as

And just so that there is no misunderstanding

of what we have here, I trust the Court understands that in
Pennsylvania liquor licenses are not just something freely
available.

There is a quota system to the number of

licenses that can be given.

There is local option which

prevents licenses from being given out in certain places,
it has been stipulated in this case that the liquor license
■provides special benefits to the Moose Lodge because the
Moose Lodge has stipulated that it would suffer damage in its
membership and operation if it didn't have this liquor
license.

And that is why, to go back to what I was saying

before and what Mr. Justice White raised before—
Q

Before you go back, does the record show the

uumbsr of private clubs licensed to serve liquor in the
state of Pennsylvania?
MR. RUBIN;:
Q

No, it does not, Mr. Justice Powell.

Do you know?

34
MR* RUBINs

Offhand?

No.

I would have to say

that it is in the hundreds.
In the brief for the Attorney General—this is not
in the record, it is in the Attorney General's brief“"there
are 4238 clubs licensed under the Pennsylvania Liquor
Code .
Q

Mr. Rubin, am I right in thinking from your

earlier comment about the proposed amendment to the bylaws
that at the time Mr. Irvis sought service ir.. the Moose
Club he was not refused as a guest personally from any
written provision in the bylaws?
MR. RUBIN:
Relinquish.

That is my understanding, Mr. Justice

That he was simply refused service and he was

told that he was refused service because he was a Negro.
There was nothing written in the bylaws that said guests
could not be Negroes.

That came during the course of

these proceedings.
Q

I suppose you're aware that in some states

the so-called locker clubs are regulated under the same
licensing authority as other liquor licenses.
ME. RUBIN:

I would have to answer that, Mr. Chief

.Justice, by saying I an* not really aware of it.

And I'm

not sure we were really talking—locker clubs is one thing,
and I think the reference that Mr. Wiener gave was to a
bottle club.

I was thinking when I read that of someone

35
who would leave-his house with a bottle in his hand, go to
his club, meet with a few of his friends an! have a drink.
To that extent I don’t know of any regulation.

But 1 would

not preelude that from being the case in other states.
Q
proof.

Mr. Rubin, 1 have one little problem of

Are you satisfied that the record shows that

Mr. Xrvis cams as a guest of a member?
1 read it, does not so allege.

The complaint, as

I realize the opinion

below states this.
MR. RUBIN:
Q

It clearly states that on page 32.

Paragraph 11 merely says the plaintiff

entered the premises and requested service ol
beverage.

food and

I find nothing there indicating he was accompanied

by a member.

You can do it later.

MR. RUBIN:

X would have to look.

I know that

the Court's opinion below very clearly stated that point.
Q

I know it did, but I’m looking for the proof.

MR. RUBIN:
Q

Yes.

Would you say that the parties litigated the

issues on that assumption?
MR. RUBIN:

Oh, yes, there was no question abort

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

That was a matter of public

record, I should say, because it was in the newspapers at
the time.

,,

No one had any question about that point.
I do want to finish the point I was making about

36

whether or not this license is like water or like
electricity.

I would sum that up simply by saying that

when you have the government providing or through the
governmental process something that is being provided to
everyone, You don’t have the same thing as you have with
the liquor license in Pennsylvania,
As I mentioned, Pennsylvania has a restriction
on liquor licenses,

They aren’t freely available.

In

addition to that, the liquor license confers certain special
benefits, as this record very clearly shows, by the Moose
Lodge's own admissions.

It would have trouble maintaining

itself, according to it in its membership and in its
operations if it didn’t have this liquor license,
Q

That would certainly be true if it didn’t

have any heat or light too,
MR, RUBINt

That's true, but the 1 eat or light

is supplied to you, to me, to everyone else,
Q

In this case it is supplied to a club that

discriminates racially,
MR, RUBIN:* That’s correct.

We think the proper

constitutional line is that the government is doing
something on a special basis, if there is seme special
bouafit not-freely available to all, and this is the case
with- the liquor license,
j

Wasn't it rather freely available to all

37
clubs, the liquor license?
MR. RUBIN:

No.

There are many places in

Pennsylvania today where there are no licenses available.
Q

With 4000 club licenses it doesn't seem to me

that they are very scarce.
MR. RUBIN:

I can only go outside the record,

Mr. Justice White, on that by telling you that in a recent
case of which I am familiar when a new municipality elected
to have licenses, there was such a rush for dub licenses
that everyone was trampled.

So that there seems to be no

end to the desire for these restrictive licenses in
Pennsylvania despite the fact that there are 4000 now in
existence.
Q

Out of all the clubs seeking them, you think

it is permissible to disqualify those clubs who discriminate?
fc

MR. RUBIN:

I would disqualify those who

discriminate on grounds of race?

and I want to make it

perfectly clear I had previously indicated in my answer to
your question that there are certain clubs which
discriminate, in which racial discrimination nay take
place as a consequence of the nature of the discrimination,
an ethnic discrimination.

It may or may not take place.

But if that ethnic discrimination is reasonable in relation
to the purposes of the club, we are satisfied that that’s
permissible.

And 1 don't want to overlook, in all candor,

38

something that is not mentioned in the brie:.' of Moose
Lodge, and that is there are many clufos~-what I'm saying
is that there are many clubs in that list that the Elks
presents which, in our opinion, would not be precluded from
getting a liquor license.

But there are many clubs which

are not in that list, the local social clubs, which have
no purpose in life except social.

There is no basis for

their discrimination except they don't want Negroes.
Those clubs would be affected by this decision in
Pennsylvania.
Q

There is no question about that.
What would you say about a club like Moose

which served the person in rhe position of your client but
then struck the host club member from membership; had no
v

direct action with respect to the person that served but
the conduit?
MR. RUBIN:

There is a case, as I recall, the

Barrows case, in this Court in which you would have stated
that the white person who was affected by the discrimination
practiced against his black brother would have a cause of
action against his club, would have standing to raise that.
Q

What if he didn t raise that though?

MR. RUBIN:
well as to raise it.

He has the right rot to raise it as
But we would have indicated that

Mr. Englehart, who happened to be the white member who took
/

Mr. Irvis to the club, would have been able to bring a

39

case under those circumstances.
Q

That is not the direct issue.

MR. ROBINs
Q

That is not the direct: issue here.

So, you’re indicating, I take it, that that

kind of sanction against the members for bringing
inadmissible guests would be something that the guest in
the position of your client could not reach? is that what,
you’re suggesting?
MR, RUBIN:

I don't think that Mr. Irvis is

harmed by a sanction against a guest because there was no
sanction.

If in fact the Moose Lodge said-Q

Isn’t he harmed in the sense that this fellow

can’t take him back to the Moose Lodge again?
MR. RUBIN:

That’s true, and I think that would

be Mr. EngMiart’s right of action to raise it.
Q

Mr. Irvis, I’d like to go back to the

discussion earlier as to the distinction you draw, if you
do, between risk and sex as a basis for discrimination.
And I have in mind the numerous court decisions which do
not allow states to discriminate on the. basis of sex with
respect to admission to state institutions, schools and the
like.
ai

Is it your position that a club could discriminate,

men’s only club or women’s only club?
MP.» RUBIN:

It really is my position that we are

slowly reaching the point where that will not be allowed.

40
X do not know if the* decisions of this Court; have yet
reached that point.

But it would seem to me; that if the

purpose of the club has nothing to do with maleness, to be
consistent with my position with respect to vhe reasons
for the club's existence, if it has nothing to do with
maleness as such and there is no reasonable ground for the
exclusion, then the club would have to be pvt to the test
of admitting the female or

giving up its license,

But. it

would not be ordered out of hand to admit the female.

That

is the basis for the distinction we are making here
between a private club and a public organisation.
Q

Would the. Whosis Whatsis Male Sauna Bath have

a reason?
MR. RUBIN:
question.

I'm going to just have to avoid that

I suppose the reasons for it in on3 culture are

different from the reasons in another.

I understand in the

Orient they don't find those distinctions as difficult as
we do.
Q

Could a reason be for this large number of

club licenses the fact that they're much cheaper?
MR. RUBIN:

The license itself is not expensive.

Mo license is expensive itself in Pennsylvania , Mr. Justice

H xshall.
Q

What is the difference between the regular

license and the--

MR. RUBIN;

The differences are only in the fact

that basically the club has more freedom in the use of its
license.

It can stay open on Sundays.

on election day.

It can stay open

Stay open on Sundays a greater time now

in Pennsylvania since we’re open elsewhere.

But there is

no other great distinction between the licenses.

Q

That’s the value, that it can stay open

longer.
MR. ROBINs

That's one of the values, certainly.

One of the values.
We think that what we are dealing here, if it
please the Court, with is a matter of grave concern to
the country.

It's a matter of whether or not state

supported, state aided discriminations should be permitted.
A member of this Court I think has stated it
anyone.

is well as

"The state action doctrine reflects che profound

judgment that denials of equal treatment and particularly
denials on account of race or color are singularly grave
when government has or shares responsibility for that.
Government is the social organ to which all in our society
look for the promotion of liberty, justice, fair and
equal treatment, and the setting of worthy norms and goals

f.o:

social conduct.

Therefore, something is < niquely amiss

;• society where the government, the authoritative oracle
•••'•.unity values, involves itself in racin'- discrimination."

42
*

We see this case as a case in which Pennsylvania,

by granting this license to this private club and to other
racially discriminating private clubs has involved itsel:c
in the racial discrimination of the private club.

And we

urge this Court to affirm the judgment of the District
Court.
Q

Mr. Rubin, hew does the state share, in terms

of that language, share in the discrimination?
MR. RUBIN:

The state would share, Mr. Chief

Justice, in the same way that the state woult have shared
in Burton.

It helped make possible the existence and the

actions of the organisation which does the discriminating.
Q

Suppose -they give up their liquor license

and continue to do just what they are doing?
MR. RUBINs

That*s perfectly all right.

The state

would then not share in the discrimination, and that’s all
we're seeking.
