ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK G. WHALEN, ESQ,,

ON BEHALF OF SHE PETITIONERS
MU SIAL®:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

this Court:
Two questions aro presented her© for this Court1 s
consideration.

The first question is, considering the

implication oi the questions, the circurastancos, and setting
trader which they were asked, were the Petitioners justified
in planting the Fifth Amendment under a state immunity statute
... n> p 0:? -i. j J2-V t o af for d tr an s acti onal immuni ty ?
And the second question, must the state affirmatively
its, when testifying pursuant to the
Illinois i rsvaity Act, that an immunity as broad in scope as
■iro Fifth Amadment Privilege is available and applicable to
them?
3.963, the Illinois Legislature created the
