ORAL ARGUMENT OF VAN OF 3, LLCOLFL

-it;, .

■ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIGM3F
MR, LA.COUR;

Mew it. please the Courts

This case is hare, on certiorari to the Mryrerr
Court, of the State of Louisiana*

The sole irrrr Ledcrr:

the Court is whether or not the denial of V?orka;Ls
Compensation to dependent illegitimate children of a single
family unit solely because they are illegitimate deprives
such illegitimate children of equal protection under the
14 th Amendment,
I'll sketch the facts of the case briefly,.
Henry Clyde Stokes was the father of four legitimate
children horn of a marriage with a lawfully wedded rifr
from whom he was separated.

He became the paramour or

common-law husband of Willie Mae Weber.

He moved his £om:

illegitimate children into the house with her and lived
there as a family unit.
‘3

When you say Mcommon-law" —

MR. L&COUR:
may put it that way.

i mean out-of-wedlock wife» if 1

Q

He could not be a cowmen-*law husband—

MR. LACOUR:

There are no common-law marriages

in Louisiana.
Q

And his lawful wife is still living?

MR. LACOURs

His lawful wife was still living,

but they were separated, not judicially separated or
divorced*
While living with Willie Mae Web or, there was
born one child of their illicit or out-of-wedlock relation
ship.

Then while they were living, he was employed as a

truck driver and was killed on the job in the course and
scope of his employ.

But there is no dispute but. that he

was covered by Workmen's Compensation under Louieiana law.
And some time after his death there m- Lorn to
Willie Ma® Weber another child, conceived, oat of the
relationship with him prior to his death.
Q

Is there any question, Mr. Lacone, about tha

second child, if that second child had been a legitimate
child although a posthumous child?

Would that child have

been counted as a child, under the Workmen's Compensation
Act?
MR. LACOUR:

Yes, it will have.

If he is a

posthumous child and an illegitimate child, even though it
isn't involved in. this case, Louisiana does draw a
distinction between a posthumous illegitimate and a

posthumous legitimate.
will

The posthumous legitimate child

;ake Workmen's Compensation but not a posthumous

illegitimate, which is another discrimination not emph«
in the case, hwevar* because there are larger discrimina­
tions here and we may not even get to this.
Q

Is that partly related in a practical sense

to the problems of proof?
MR. LhCQCR;

I suppose so.

However, without being

facetious, I suppose the proof of paternity—you prove it
by outward manifestation of family membership in•this
instance in the posthumous child.

The mother could sec

the child, she was pregnant; there is no doubt in the
record, it is not in dispute but that Henry Clyde Stokes*
the deceased employee, was the father or the child*
0

Has Louisiana in any case you know of ever

given any special status to extrajudicial acknowledgements,
that is, letters, affidavits, things of that kind,
acknowledgements of paternity?
MR. L&COUR:

Not of paternity, of maternity.

Even though Louisiana law requires—-well, it's unsettled in
Louisiana as to whether or not what we call an informal
acknowledgement of an illegitimate child lift that child
from the abject lowest level of which—-the Civil Court
says it's known by the appellation basket, whereas the
child acknowledged either formally by notarial act or some

formal act or informally , the mother because o;

informal acknowledgement of maternity is accepte i whereas
there is some reservation with respect to informal?
acknowledgement of paternity.
Q

k%

Lacour, in the amicus brief 1

a statement that these out of wedlock children

think io
utld not

have been acknowledged under—is 'it Article 204 of your
code?
MR. LACOUR:
Q

204 of the Louisiana Civil Code.

Do you agree with that?

MR. LACOUR;

That is correct.

That is correct.

The provision for acknowledgement, for formal acknowledge­
ment, has a restriction.

The restriction is that a parent

may not acknowledge a child, either informally or formallywe're dealing with formally here—if at the tinti of
conception there was an impediment to the marriage of the
parent of the illegitimate child.

In this instance, it

would have been a bigamous marriage at the moment: of
conception.

The impediment was that Henry Clyde Stokes was

lawfully married to another woman and therefore these
children could not have been acknowledged.
Q

And this is a. distinction from last term's

case of labine v. yincent?’
MR. LACOUR:

If we are going to focus our

7
attention tap on

Is argued as being the distinction

between Labine and Levy,, wherein Labina apparently is
saying that there was an insurmountable barrier in. bray,,
whereas there is not an insurmountable barrier hvjre in that
the children could be acknowledged.

Of con::; so, yea will

see that there is an insurmountable barrier here when you
look at what is said in the amicus brief and rhar the
Louisiana Civil Court actually provided under
is an insurmountable barrier hare because, huau

couldn’t even be acknowledged.
Q

What is the purpose of that barri

codej, do you think?

I don't know of its being ;u auurt in

common-»law states, anyway,
MR. .bkCCuRs
the civil law.

As X recall, it’s a carryover in

I guess it's something to diacourage-'-which

was rejected in Levy to discourage the illicit relationship
we would produce or also to prohibit the briaginc into this-.

up to the status of a child a child where the parents were
actually married to each other.

It also--the law, whether

it5 a constitutional or not—an incestuous marriage would
prevent the acknowledgement of a child.

Also to the

extent, the time when it was constitutional a miscagenous
marriage, a miscegenous relationship, a difference in race
would have been an impediment to the marriage.

Consequently

we had a long line* of cases where mulatto children couldn’t

be acknowledged.

Q

1 conceive that than, is a rational

What we are raying here, ae take the position the

the thrust of Levine v. Vincent is not to reject or overrule
Levy, that Levy which held that under Article 2315, which
is the Louisiana basic tort law—all of our law for
negligence or other tort claims arise or get its source
from Article 2315 of the Louisiana Civil Code, which
provides that whoever is injured as a result of the actions
of another, they are entitled to reparation.

Art then

Louisiana through the years added wrongful death to as to
give an action for death to survivors.

As the Court knows,

in Levy the claims for. illegitimate children of. the mother
who died as a result of an alleged fall, and the denial of
cause of action to those children was held to be violative
of the equal protection clausa.
What we are saying here, if Levy is still the
law and Labina, it seems to m-3 too fain to say that Levy
is still the law.

And what Labina is saying is that the

9
clevis! of inheritance rights is not the ;oa:o kind of
leuivi and deprivation.

Under Louisiana law the Work-r.errs Corpse:::.sties lr;;
is the replacement for the tort law.

So, 2315 cannot be

used against the employer here. '1 need to go into just o
little more. explanation of the facta, because chore -u.
tie-in between Workmen’s Compensation and the Louisiana
Tort law.

What happened further in this case r e; chat

the grandmother of the four legitimate children brought a
t

tort action against a third party tort feasor who one
responsible for the accident in which the employee was
killedc

But you still have your cause of action against

your third party for a tort, even though you have your
Workmen's Compensation; but whatever Workmen5s Compensation
you recover from your third party tort feasor, the
beneficiary will ©we it to the employer or its insurer
under the right of subrogation.
So, the tort suit was settled.

The maximum

compensation payable in Louisiana in any instance at that
time was $14,000.

The tort claim exceeded $14,000.

The

four legitimate children then came back into the state

10
court and dismissed their claim for Workmen's Compensation
on the basis that there was nothing for them to recover
anyway because if they recove:, u
Aetna Casualty and the truck driving concern, the employer.
Then the employer and its insurer moved to dismiss the
suit on the ground that the Workmen's Compensation bed ■
exhausted.
We have, of course, pleaded that the denial of
Workmen’s Compensation to the two illegitimate children
would constitute the denial of equal protection.,

And the

trx-a.I. court held that they were entitled to Workmen's
Compensation but only if there was any left after the
tour legitimate children had used it all up.
appealed on up.

So, from that

And what happens then is the Supreme

Court of Louisiana, interpreting the Workmen's Compensation
Law of Louisiana is saying that you have six children born
of a man, who are his dependents, they are supported by him.
They are members of a family unit which he is maintaining
at the time of his life and at the time of his death, is
a family unit consisting of six children.

The out-of-

wedlock wife or the mother of the two illegitimate
tne step-mother of the legitimate.

So, everything

is also
is equal

insofar as the nexus or
<~ue relationship between the father
and the six children.

The only difference between the fonr

“ho yot the H°rkmen's Compensation and the. two who did not

11

.is that the four were legitimate and the other two were
iIlegitimate.
Q

Assuming that the record supports that

statement; Mr. Lacour, in this ease, unat would ooc
necessarily be true- with respect to all xllegitimate
children, would it» as a general proposition?

They aren't

always under cover and protection of the father.
MR. LACOUR:

No.

If they were acknowledged

illegitimate children, would be beneficiaries under the
Louisiana Workmen's Compensation Law, formally acknowledged
illegitimate.

If those children had been acknowledged,

they would have been entitled to Workmen’s Compensation,
if I understand Mr. Chief Justice’s question correctly.
I think I have just about covered the essential
features of the case except perhaps to re-emphasis3'that
we believe what we’re arguing here is exactly what Labine—
that is, the Louisiana case involving inheritance - the
reservation of Labine.
We believe also the insurmountable barrier is the
distinction

if 1 am clearly pointing out what has happened

in this case, there is no opportunity for the two
illegitimate children to get any Workmen’s Compensation
unless by sheer accident.

Because, if I may point out, the

$14,000 maximum Workmen’s Compensation was never paid by
the compensation carrier.

It was paid by the third party

12
tort feasor.

The compeneation—the employer and the

insurer oret credit for it bscavse autcm-ivca.cai.lv raey would
get credit for it under the Louisiana Workmen's Compensation
Law.

Ordinarily Workmen’s Compensation benefits are paid

weekly and would have $35 a week here for 400 ;•/:

Here it's

And so the court just effectively do ni the

door against the two illegitimate and taking six children,
living as one family unit, all equally siipporten by the
father, no apparent difference in his treatment :u. what he
would have wished for them to have.

But because the two

are illegitimate, the four get all of the Workmen’s

Compensation and the other two are left to go on whatever
way they can.
Q

Mr. Lacour, would your case be any different

if 204 were not present* if the barrier of 204 were not
there and he had just not acknowledged his children?
MR. LACOUR:

Yes, it would have been? it would

have been different, yes.

Yes.

There’s 204—-if there had

not been an impediment, he could have acknowledged them.
If he had

acknowledged them under Louisiana Workmen’s

And if they e

way equally dependent upon the father, sod it

is established and undisputed in the record that they are
his children, then the exclusion of them from participation
in Workmen's Compensation along with the other children
who had no more dependency upon the father than they had
would still be an invidious, arbitrary, capricious—without
any basis at all other than that they are illegitimate and
the other four are legitimate.

Q

Except that he had a way to acknowledge them

MR. t-kCGUR:

You would say thou that id;at would

he

ay. but I am not willing and my argument t ere is

that that- I think is more eye-catching than the t eal
distinction of Labine.

X don't think that that

insurmountable barrier which was pointed out by the court
there is as really

the real reason as when you real,

underneath here, that inheritance does not involve the s.rus
kind of nexus in attacking the human relation between
people that parent and children do, and that when you de .
cause of action to a child whose parents’ life has been
snuffed out, you are denying reparation for a deprivation.
But when you deny the parent the lav; of succession and the
state says you go this way or that way, the state is not
pinpointing and saying you lost something but you can’t
get any reparation because you’re illegitimate.

The state

is just saying you don't fall in that class under whose
rules you would get the right of inheritance.

And I think

the real distinction between Labine and Vincent is not the
insurmountable barrier but the real invidiousness of tellingone who has lost his parent you cannot get the reparation
that one was entitled to from the loss of a parent merely
9

because you're illegitimate.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. K3HSOM MOOREr ESQ.,
ON BEHALF 01? THE RESPONDENTS
MR, MOORE;

Mr. Chief Justice end insv it plento

the Court;
The counsel in this case looked at this particular
case before yea as somewhere in a grey area either between
Lew v. Louisiana, Labine v. Vincent or perhaps in the
grey on either of the extremes of these two cases.

It's

the opinion of -the respondents that there is no invidious
discrimination in this case.

I*d like to try to contrast

this case with Law and Labina.
First, in the Levy case you had a tort situation.
The Louisiana law has drawn this distinction and has not
extended Levy beyond tort.

In the Labine decision this

honorable Court noted that this was a distinction.

Levy

applied to tort.
Secondly, in the Levy case it was pointed out
quite forcefully that a wrongdoer was about to go scott
free.

No one was going to recover.

No tort feasor was

going to have to pay for the death of the mother in the
Levy case.

There is no question of someone getting

However, I might point out an interesting
corollary.

Under Louisiana * s Workmen * s Camponsaticn Law

the employer is entitled to recover Workmen's

benefits he pays to an employs© frcsa -the tort feasor, if
there is a tort feasor who injured the employee.

We nor as

respondents have lost that right because of one-year
proscription in Louisiana law.
1967.

This accident took place in

Therefore—
Q

But you have gotten a complete set-off„

haven’t you, from the recovery by the four legitimate
children?
MR. MOORE:

We got that, hut I don't think it's

clear at all that what should happen is this honorable Court
should reverse this decision.

It may well be we've got to

turn right around and pay the two children Mr. L&cour
represents their fair share and then try to recover that
back from the tort feasor, which we can no longer do.
We're barred by one-year proscription.
Q

Isn't 65 percent of the wages the maximum,

whether or not there are four children or six children?
MR. MOOREs

That’s correct.

That's the maximum

amount of wages paid under Louisiana law.
Q

And the four recovered more than the maximum

and you got a complete set-off? am I wrong?
MR. MOORE:

A complete set-off as to those four.

Your Honor.
Q

Isn’t 65 . percent the maximum?

MRi, MOORE:
0

That’s right.

And whether there are four or sir: or twelve

children,
MR. MOORS;

What I am trying to say, Your Honotr

is it's not clear at all whether or not 1 v/xii still he

errs a hi on.

The set-off I got applied to the four people under
Louisiana law at the time this case was decided who ecu. 11
recover compensationi

Mr. L&cour1 a clients could not.

•So, .it's not clear in our law.

In other words, if you

reverse this case, it may well be that 1 have to now pay
his clients; and the set-off I have against the fear
legitimate children is no protection to me now as to these
two children.

And, therefore, the tort feasor- ■•cm:* year

has gone by, and so this is an interesting corollary; if
this, case is reversed, the tort feasor would gat off scot
free as far as the liability for compensation of two more
children.
The next point I would like to point out, and
distinction, is the fact of this acknowledged or
unacknowledged illegitimate children situation,

lades: the

tort law of Louisiana prior to Levy, whether you acknowledged
or unacknowledged, made no difference.

If you were

legitimate children could born .in.wedlock or adopted„

This

thru

applies in this case, that you are not excluding from.
Workmen!s Compensation by law; you are ranked but not
excluded.
Q

In other words, had there been no legitimate

children in this case, the illegitimate children that
hr, Lacour represents would have been entitled to some
share of Workmen's Compensation?
MR. MOORE:
Q

That's correct, Your Honor.

But only as a lower preference, isn’t it?

MR. MOORE:

As a matter of ranking preference,,

Under Section 1232 of our Louisiana's Workmen's
Compensation Law which I quote verbatim in my brief, there
®re

classifications or ranking of which dependent in

which situation in which situation gets what percent of the
«rlowable wages to be paid Workmen’s Compensation benefits.
Ine illegitimate unacknowledge children are treated as
other dependents under the eighth ranking, meaning in order
of preference.

They are eight in the line of preference,

Luc of those the eight, the first, second, fourth, fifth,

19
and seventh all have situations whore there may be
somebody in a higher ranking that does not use up the full
65 percent.

The balance then goes down the line which

to the eighth rank, illegitimate unacknowledged children.
In other words, I'll give you an example.

Under

Section Five—Subsection Five—it says if there are two
children, meaning legitimates or acknowledged, these two
children recover forty-six and one quarter percent of the
wages.

The difference between this forty-six and one

quarter percent and sixty-five percent would go down the
line to the next order of persons, all the way to the end.
In this case the illegitimate children would recover ihn
difference between forty-six and a quarter and -sixty-five
percent.
Q

Or if the decedent had no illegitimate

children, no widow, but had one parent-—
MR. MOORE:
Q

That's right.

--then thirty-two and a half percent would go

to the illegitimate children.
MR. MOORE:

Correct.

So, we are trying to point

out here that there is no absolute barrier for illegitimate
unacknowledged child to recover compensation as there was
in the tort law of Louisiana dealing with 2315.
Mow, in the case of Labine v. Vincent, the same
thing is true .

An illegitimate unacknowledged child has

20

absolutely no right to inheritance under Louisiana lav/.
This again, as. we just pointed out, is not true in our
compensation law.
Let’s take a situation of the acknowledged
illegitimate child.
Q

How is it treated?

Right there, Mr.; Moore; you conceive that

these children could not hare been acknowledged ur l:r 204°
MR. MOORE:

At the time of the deceased’s cl

no, they could not; that is correct,

of course,

the law-

goes on to point out that should there two persons
subsequently contract e legal marriage, they than vu

dept.

And so the restriction there is not one for all i;ue.,

it

worked out that way in this case because obviously the mar?,
died before he had a chance to properly divorce his first
wife and marry the woman with whom ha was living.
In the case of the acknowledged illegitimate
child, once again under Levy ha had no right of recovery.
As you point out in Labina v. Vincent, he does have a right
of succession, a right to be in a succession, but he is not
ranked equally with legitimate children.

Even in Labine

v. Vincent he comes in a preferential order.

He semes down

the line ahead of the State of Louisiana and several other
miscellaneous persons-™way down the line in order of
succession.

But an acknowledge illegitimate child is not

treated equally with a legitimate child under Louisiana

21
succession law,
Mow we come to Louisiana’s Workmen * s Compensation
■'•aw :.ud ww so 3 that an acknowledged illegitimate child is
■created equally with the adopted or children born to &
legal marriage»

Therefore, once again m

that

looking for similarities Louisiana * & Workmen1 s Ccptig......
Law door not have anywhere near the barriers fount in
Levy and is indeed far better off than those this honorable
Court pointed out in L-ablne v. Vincent»
Further, as I pointed out, in the case of whether
a child could be acknowledged or not, if those two parents
subsequently marry, they can then acknowledge a child.

I'd

like to also point out the discrimination here as to the
illegitimate children is no different than discrimination
or the ranking of all persons in the eight subcategories
of dependents.

In other words, the ascendants are ranked

over the collateral relations, and the descendants are
ranked over the ascendants.

And so this is just a whole

schematic lineup of rankings here.
discrimination in any of them»

There is no invidious

The idea is to give a

preferential order of how the support is to be parceled out.
A question was asked a moment ago as for the
reason for this ranking or why this was done.

And 2’d like

to point out that on page 76 of the appendix, the
Louisiana Supreme Court summed it up as best as we can find

anywhere in print.

The Louisiana Supreme Court raid

’For ourselves,-we find not

,U3 in the distinction

made in the compensation statute which would protect such
legally recognised family relationships, any more than the
preference given legitimate dependent children (even
illegitimate ones when they are duly acknowledged) over
dependent parents.”
What the court is saying here is that th.a
Legislature of Louisiana has felt that this protects the
existing family order by parceling out the cospr: ration
based upon, first of all, the question of depend
secondly, the question of the family relationship.,
I'd like to point cut too rbio ■>enorar ■ o Ocurt
in the Levy decision noted the fairness of Louisiana*s
Workmen’s Compensation Law in Footnote No. 7.

So, I would

like to point again to the fact that Louisiana's Worsen*&
Compensation Law does not have absolute invidious
discrimination or an absolute barrier to recovery.

It's

just that this particular case it appears that this time the
two

illegitimate children will not recover anything,
If subsequently before the four weeks expires—

and I've got to assume by this time it has expired—if one
or more of the legitimate children had died, then there
wouldn't be this

balance or overflow; it would go down the

line to the illegitimates.

And so even after the court

23
rendered ite initial opinion in this case, it was still
poeeible for the illegitimates to come into some Workmen's
Compensation benefits»

It was noted and preserved in the

judgment of the trial court»

Q

Mr, Moore, had these children born born out of

wedlock but the- impediment not bean there to actual
legitimation, had they been legitimated * they would have*
recovered as lawful children under the compensation law*
MR. MOORE:

Correct, under the compensation law.

That Vs not true—was not true under the tort law and it's
not true still under our succession law in Labine v. Vincent»
But it is true in the Workmen's Compensation Law„
Now, Your Honors, I'd like to point out in the
language in Labine and Levy which leave to Louisiana's
discretion or its power to do what it has done in set ting
up this Louisiana Workmen's Compensation Law»

In Labine

this honorable Court pointed out and I quote:

"Levy did

not say and cannot fairly be read to say that a state can
never treat an illegitimate child differently from
legitimate of f spring. '3
And, further, the Court noted, and I quote: 11 The
choices reflected by the intestate succession statutes are
choices within the power of the state to make.

The

Federal Constitution does not give this Court the power to
overturn the state's choice under the guise of constitutional

24
interpretation because* the Justices of this Court can
provide better rules."
Under Levy the majority opinion, and I quote:
"In applying the equal protection clause to social and
economic legislation we give great latitutde to the
legislature in making classifications. '*
I want to say; of course, Louisiana:s borlvoihs
Compensation Law is very definitely social and economic
legislation.

And we ask this honorable Court to find that

the State of Louisiana has had this latitude in making its
classifications, that they are not invidious, and that the
state can in this case treat illegitimate children somewhat
differently in a ranking because it has not absolutely
prevented them from recovery.

And we ask you, therefore,

to find that there is no invidious discrimination and to
affirm the judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court.
Q

Mr. Moore, may I ask you a question.

The

classification that you have been discussing applies in the
case of death.

Is there a similar classification under

Louisiana law that applies with respect to Workmen's
Compensation benefits resulting from an injury?
MR. MOORE:

No, sir, Your Honor, in the case of

injury, the benefits are paid directly to the injured
employee.
Q

And regardless of his disability?

Probably to a commentae—

MR. MOORSs

He'd have to have someone appointed

as a tutor—not a tutor but an administrator of his estate?
the money would be paid to that person.
Only if you indicate a death situation do you run
into this classification of who are the beneficiaries of
the compensation benefits.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, Moore.

Bo you have anything further, Mr. Laceur?
MR,. XdiCOUR:

Yea.

May it pleas a the Chief

Justice and the members of the Court;
The argument is made here thvf the employe:

its compensation insurer would perhaps be prejudiced by
an unfavorable decision in that now proscription has nan,
has it net, and would be without their remedy of subrogation,
But the record will show, however, that the circumstances
in which the employer and its insurer find themselves

mow

are really part of its own doing--! want the court to knew
that the illegitimate children were brought into the suit by
what we call concurrences in Louisiana, by

It rasit nearly be

In my

brief I footnote that point and when. I first read it when
Levy was first decided, X was mindful of the fact that it

was not called to the attention of the Court thru the
fairness or the permission, of the allowance of Warn a a.. J a
Compensation to illegitimate children such :n
found there was not because they were children, and I want
to get it clearly understood and try to get it a.cross that

illegitimate children, when they come in under claryificatic.n

dependents»

And anybody else who might ba a member of the

happen to be dependent and they are not respected an
children who had that neerr.s that we were talking about,
'that the Court was talking about in Levy, and. that is
really Workmen's Compensation replaces 2315 here.

And to

disregard the children as they did on the claim, 2315 or:
the tort, is an invidious; discrimination.

You are taking

from their kids the very same thing—denying to them the
very same thing under the guise of Workmen's Compensation
that is being denied them under Levy.
Q

Under Subsection.Bight a complete stranger—

that is, a complete non-family member—could qualify as a.
dependent, as I understand it.
MR. LACOUR;
Q

Yes.

If he had proof—

If he proves the fact of the payments—

MR. LACOUR:

These children would have paid them—

even though they are all acknowledged, incapable of being
acknowledged, illegitimate--would have paid them whatever
probably would have been left if there had not been enough

It's your claim that whataver Bight may or

may not provide, the equal protection claims of the 14th
Amendment entitles your clients to be treated as children.
MR. LhCCUR;

Right.

Not only or a probable basia

but in these particular facts under this particular curs
where there is one family unit, and there is no other reanor
to mistreat these two children here, as they were mistreated
in that they were illegitimate, judging this particular
case as invidious as any case that now exists.
see how we can escape seeing a

And I don't

in the treatment

of the children and agree that the Supreme Court of
Louisiana ought to he referred and the case remanded for
appropriate relief.

Thank you. ,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, Mr. Moore.

Thank you, Mr. Lacour.

The case is submitted.
