ME, C-IIEF Justice BURGER:

We will hear arguments

against Tatum and others.'
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GRISWOLD:

May it. please the Court:

This case is here on the government's petition
tor writ of certiorari to review a divided decision of the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit.

The question before that court was whether the

District Court had rightly dismissed the complaint filed in
that court on February 17, 1970, by the parties who are
respondents here..

The complaint was dismissed by the

district Court without the production of any evidence.
Thus the case arises here on the complaint in the District
Court of the motion to dismiss and certain affidavits which
were filed in connection with these matters.
In their brief, the respondents say that, and I
quote, ‘‘The government has persistently attempted to convert
rhis case into something other than the case brought by the
plaintiff&,"

I’m afraid that’s the way we feel about the

respondents.

We think that the case is in the appendix while

they try to present it on the basis of two volumes of
hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Civil Rights.

4

oho Yiii:,xom

o.L;,:i

fiwlley's case when he said that it is one

.

thing ho put the cage in a nutshell and another thing to
beep it there o'
The complaint filed in the District Court was'
filed by four individuals and nine unincorporated
associations.

It is framed as a. class action on behalf of

all other individuals and organizations, and I read from
page 8 of the appendix:

“«..all other individuals and

organizations who wish to exercise their right under the
First Amendment of the United States Constitution to engage
in peaceful political protest, demonstrations,■marches,
rallies, church meetings and other forms of constitutionally
protected expression and assemblies without surveillance by
defendants' agents and without becoming the subject of
dossiers, reports, and files, defendants * data bank and
intelligence network."
The complaint then contains allegations that the
Army had been conducting surveillance of lawful and peaceful
civilian activity within the United States and that this
information is stored in a computerized data bank.

In

Exhibit A attached to the complaint they give a sample of
the sort of material which has been compiled.

This appears

•n pages 13“-.? 1 of the appendix, and I would like to read a
14

,

5
Hartfordj Connecticut, March 11, 1968:
Aoproxiraately 20 persons picketed outside the U. S, Federal
Bii lining.

The protestors carried placards denouncing the

war in Vietnam and the payment of income tax.

The

demonstration was sponsored by the Voluntovm, Conn., Chapter
of the New England Committee for Non-Violent Action."
And on page 16s

"San Jose, Calif.:

An Anti-Dew

Chemical Company demonstration was held in front of the
Administration Building at San Jose State Collegfe.

A crowd

of about 400-500 persons were present, but approximately
30 percent of these were spectators or curious onlookers.
At 1230 hours the demonstrators moved to the Morris Daily
Auditorium where they were refused permission to hold a
rally.

San Jose State College officials, however, -permitted

the protestors to use the music building for an afternoon
rally.

The. rally received very little support and attendance

was light.”
I am not going to read others of those items, but
it’s apparent that they are the kind of items that
constantly appear in the newspapers, information of very
little significance and not at all repressive in its nature.
There is also attached to the complaint as an
curlibit e. copy of an article by Captain Christopher II. Pyle,
which appeared in the January, 1970 issue of a publication
called The Washington Monthly.

There can be no doubt that

6
the p-ublicc.tion of this article was the immediate - reason for
the. bringing of this suit,

There are no allegations in the

complaint that any specific harm or injury has been done to
any of the plaintiffs, either individuals or the unincorpor­
ated association.

It was alleged'that this type of

activity has a chilling effect-on the plaintiffs and others
seeking to exercise their First Amendment rights»
There is no allegation in the complaint that there
was any surveillance of any Wholly private activity; but
it is charged that members of the military went to penile
meetings and rather elaborately recorded what they saw.
Before proceeding further, I should call attention
to soma background facts.

There is no rigid dichotomy

between the military and civilian in this country.

Both

the Constitution and the statutes provide for the use of
the military in domestic, civilian contexts.

The military

is at all times subject to civilian control through the
President as Commander-In-Chief and the Secretary of
Defense and the secretaries and other civilian officers of
th

three branches of the armed forces.
A high, proportion of adult American males,

in ; lx:ding many members- of Congress and the courts has served
in the military for a time.

Many of them retain -their

civilian outlook as is shown clearly by one of the amicus

on the Monday after the death of Martin Luther King with
..-melee in the air and a soldier on every street corner as
I passed.

The Court sat but a number" of the persons whose

admission I was to move that day did not get here.
We can recall too that the Warren Commission
reported that advance intelligence had not been adequate
for the protection of the President and

recommended that

greater steps be taken to compile data about persons who
might be inclined to violence.

A similar recommendation was

made by the Earner Commission in 1968.

Or perhaps to put it another

waythere was an absence of adequate civilian control.

One

of the problems of an array is that yon ordinarily have far
more people than you have any vise for" because you have to
have enough people at the right place when the need arises..
Here the Army had a lot of people in intelligence.

‘They

spent more than 90 percent of their time in investigating
people who needed clearances for military or civilian
employment.

But they had men remaining, and they received

directives’ that they were to build up intelligence for use
in case the military ever needed it in connection with
civilian disturbances.

So, they built up the material we

And they had a computer and they put all of this

on the computero

And from the computer they built up a list

of the names which appeared in the data, which the plaintiffs
call a "black list."
From my point of view, it was poor judgment, an
inappropriate use of military resources.

As JSecretary of the

Army Froehlka has said, and I quote, "From the vantage point
of hiriaighv

the guidance and direction to the military for

rbance information was too often

Or in Senator Ervin3s words:

"Soma people charged

with responsibility in this, especially at the local level,,
got a, little bit too zealous in their activity.”
With this summary statement of the facts where the
case arises on the complaint, the motion to dismiss, and
the accompanying exhibits and affidavits as included in the
appendix, X would like to summarize our legal position.
First, the complaint does not allege a justiciable
controversy.

And, related to that, the plaintiffs do not

have standing to maintain.the case.

There is a controversy

all right, out it is not a Case or Controversy, with
capital "C 3", in the Constitutional sense.
t-:,; T-. % what was done, as alleged in the complaint,
unwise as it may have been, did not violate the Constitution
or any statute.
Third, if there was anything done that was legally
wrong and the case is justiciable, it has been stopped.
And, fourth, in this situation, I do not claim
this in the strict sense, but the case is not one now, if
it ever was-, in which there is equity jurisdiction, that is,
in which it is appropriate for a court of equity to
intervene by way of injunction.
Let Mv turn first to the question of justiciability„

10
As 1 have already said, no plaintiff alleges that anything
has been done to injure him.
rests on chill.

The whole cause of action

1 know of no decision of this

has been based on chill alone.

Court which

In every case in which chill

has been a factor there has been a criminal prosecution
either in process or immediately threatened, or there had
bean governmental attempts to compel

disclosure of

information as a prerequisite to entitlement to government
employment or benefits.
There was an individual before the Court who said
that he was injured in some immediate and concrete fashion.
Here the complaint proceeds only on the broadest of
generalities.

It states on page 10 of the appendix, and

I quote, that ‘The purpose and effect of the collection,
maintenance and distribution of the information on civilian
political activity described herein is to harass and
intimidate plaintiffs and others similarly situated."

Yet

they do not allege a single instance or harassment or
intimidation.

They do allege generally an invasion of their

privacy, damage to their reputations, and an adverse effect
on their employment.

But they cite no specific instance or

example.
The dissenting judge in the court below called
there indefinite claims of highly visionary apprehensions.
They do not, we submit, have the concreteness and sufficiency

of focus to make the claims justiciable.

There is no

assertion here that the activity complained of has caused
direct injury to these plaintiffs or to others similarly
situatedi

Instead, they appear here, as they have said

various times

in their arguments below and in their briefs,

on behalf of millions of people.
But wren you appeal" on behalf of millions of
people, the case is no longer concrete and specific.

That

is the sort of thing which is appropriate for consideration
by the legislative branch or the executive but does not
present a case for decision by a court.

The case is much

like the situation in United Public Workers against
Mitchell, a case which they cite once but skip over very
quickly,where the court refused to find a generalised claim
as to the validity of the Hatch Act to be justiciable.
Justiciability is not a mere technicality.

Elusive

as it may be, it is an expression of one of the basic concept
on which or:

Constitution rests, the separation of power.

The courts exercise judicial power under the Constitution.
This is not the power to decide all the questions of law
which arise in she course of the administration of the
government.

It is the power to act as a court to decide the

concrete ano specific issues which arise between men and men

General questions arising with respect to the
structure and the administration of the government are best
resolved by the other coordinate branches established by
oho Constitution.

The executive adiwiniaters bettor than its

courts are equipped to administer.

And the congress

formulates general policies with more responsiveness to the.
democratic pro- »ss than the courts can.

The courts * with

their independence, are better qualified to deal with

Many of the problems here are very suited

to the sort of general policy making which the Congress
can do»

If Congress can devise appropriate means to

regulate the military in this area, it has the power to dp
so.

The Senate already has held extensive hearings on this

specific question, and a number of bills have been
introduced.

And I shall indicate below, the executive has

also taken clear and specific action.

plaintiffs have adequate standing, then we say that or. a

in which the Court can find the text of official actions
which show that the practices which the respondents here
complain about have been stopped.
Q

I see references in the report of the Senate

Judiciary Committee to this case and the problems.

Can we

take judicial notice of that?
Mid GRISWOLD;

Mr. Justice, I think you cannot take

judicial notice of the evidence and testimony which was
presented before that hearing.

I think you can take judicial

notice of the official actions which, among other places,
are recorded in volume two of those hearings.
As I '."save said, the surveillance has been stopped,
the computer banks and print-outs have been destroyed.

The

index list of names or black list have been destroyed.

In

each case, one copy has been retained for the purposes of
this litigation.

We did not want to destroy all for fear

that someone eould say that we had improperly interfered with
'the due adifi i u is hration of .justice.

But that one copy is in

1?
good hands

and will be destroyed as soon as this litigation

is terminated or the courts give us authority to act.
It’s true that the respondents say that we cannot
certify that every single copy has been destroyed.

The

ar that there has
been a bans, fids effort to recall and destroy every copy
and orders have been given against the utilization of any
copy.

I do not think that more can be done even under the

ardors of a court.
In this circumstance, w© do not say that the case
is necessarily 3Root.

In some situations past action is

sufficient to obviate mootness, even though the action has
been stopped.

We do say, however, that the actions taken

by the Army are sufficient to destroy equity jurisdiction
in the District Court.

We sometimes forget that equity has

a jurisprudence of its own, and one of the principles of
equity is that it does not utilize the mighty remedy of
injunction wren the conduct complained of has been stopped
in the absence of extraordinary circumstances such as a
substantial risk that the conduct will be resumed if this
Court does not intervene.

This is essentially the basis of

this Court’s recent decision in the Medical Committee on
Human Rights case.

Here there is no such risk.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK ASK IK# ESQ. ,
■ON BBEAX.P 'OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ASRXN:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Courts
Senator Ervin will take the final ten minutes of
this argument and will deal mainly with the ultra vires
nature of the military conduct.
X agree with the Solicitor General that the only
materials before this Court are the plaintiffs’ allegations.
But with all due respect# I believe the Solicitor has again
misstated and misrepresented those allegations in the
circumstances of this case.

And it is the plaintiffs’

allegations which are here# not the allegations as the
defendants would like to rewrite them and not some state
of facts as they might appear in the light of hearsay
assertions offered by defense counsel nor the Solicitor’s
efforts to justify the Army's conduct with respect to smoke
in the air and soldiers on street corners.
The sole question for this Court to decide is
whether the plaintiffs were entitled to a judicial hearing,
whether their uncontested allegations of unauthorized and
unconstitutional conduct by the Array earned them to right
to their day in court.

It was defendants who moved to

dismiss this complaint, who said, in effect, construe
plaintiffs* allegations most favorably, give them all the

abt and' all the inferences? they said

there is still no set of facts which night be proved which
would entitle plaintiffs even to a hearing- on the merits.
The trial judge acted on defendants‘ advice; he decided that
taking everything into consideration plaintiffs alleged
had no right tc be in court.

s

they

The District Court was in

error about that and Judges Uilkey and Tamm in the Court of
Appeals were correct, as I believe a. review of the plaintiffs1
al legations wi 1.1 demonstrate.
1 don't want to go over in great detail the factualsetting in this case.

We are dealing, it's true, with a

public issue that has been discussed and reported upon very
widely in the two years since plaintiffs filed their
cpmpXsinfc.

But I do want to point up the facts which make

these allegations justiciable.
Plaintiffs set forth a pervasive system of military
spying and data keeping on the political

activities of the

plaintiffs and other law-abiding Americans.

Over a thousand

Army agents around the country helping to keep track of the
political assemblages and speeches of citizens unassociated
with the armed forces, citizens like plaintiffs and members
or plaintiff organications who had done no wrong, people

Army belatedly .-Invoked to justify its lawless behavior.
Other information being gathered by (Hurlk and Gestiri?)

and uridercover methods of operation.

And X must point out

that the Solicitor General is wrong.

He has not read

plaintiff's complaint,

There are allegations of electron! e

a 11 r ve i 11 an c*i n p 1 a i :i \ 11 f fs8 complaint.

Paragraph Eight

says very specifically that much of the information which
is being gathered by the Army was gathered both through
anonymous informants and through the use of photographic
and electronic equipment.

So, this was not wholly public

activity we wars talking about.

There were uncontested

allegations that clandestine, undercover operations were
taking place in gathering this information on the political
activities of the plaintiffs and others acting similarly.
Q

The allegation as I have it before me is a

little ambiguous.

Electronic equipment, of course, could

include a tape recorder at a public meeting.

In its context

here with the use of photographic electronic equipment,
that would almost seem to be the meaning ascribed to it,
wouldn't it?
MR. ASKIN:

I don't think so, Mr. Justice.

I think we have to construe this complaint broadly,

Again
we were

making allegations that they were using a variety of means,
both photogruphing people at demonstrationsand I would
aay that the allegation includes both taping meetings and
use of other kinds of electronic—
Q

There, is no allegation of any specific or

22
explicit allegation, wiring tapping or'what has become known
a- bugging or anything of that nature that I have been able
to find.
Ml0 illKINs

No, there is not, Mr. Justice.

We did

have witnesses at the hearing in the District Court, formerArmy agents , who were prepared to testify about some of the
undercover activities they had engaged in.

They were not

permitted to go on the stand.
Q

In short, X an», right, am X not,

this complaint as not relying on the Fourth Amendment but

23
Q

There was no answer here? only a motion to

MR. ASKIN:

That's correct, Mr. Justice Douglas.

Only the motion to dismiss.

And plaintiffs' complaint,

its exhibits, its affidavits, in support of its

motion

for preliminary injunction which went on at the same time
as the motion to dismiss was heard.
The complaint states that the Army was using a
teletype system similar to the onesmaintained by news
services, reporting the information it was gathering to a
central intelligence command at Fort Holabird and out again
to military intelligence units all over the country.

Data

banks, large and small, at various military installations
themselves storing and often computerizing the data on
plaintiffs and others for their own use, further dissemination
of the data to both military and

civilian federal and

sttbe governmental units all over the country.
In short, we put forth a chilling system having
nothing to do with a military function.

Indeed, until it

was revealed to be part of the operations of the United
States Army, this was a kind of system which Americans
associated with someplace else, not with the United states
of America.

All had been the subject

of the Array's intelligence reports.

The government's

assertion that the plaintiffs do not allege the Army spied

on selected individuals or groups, it’s double-talk.
Plaintiffs * allegations are as clear as can be* that
information about them was collected, was transmitted over
the Army's teletype network, was fed into its data bank, was
then dirseminated further around the country, indeed to
military installations around the world.
Plaintiffs allege that this program invaded, not
only invaded their privacy, threatened their reputations in
employment, but also caused immediate and irrentedial injury
to their First Amendment rights, both because they themselves
were forced to become more circumspect about their speech and
association and, more importantly, because others were
deterred from associating with them in•pursuit of political
objectives and frightened away from membership in their
-•ssedations and organisations.
The nation has since discovered in fact that
plaintiff’s complaint described only the very tip of an

thing we have.
MR. aSKiN:

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, our

allegations we believe are complete and state clearly a
bl© claim.

We do believe that in construing our

complaint and liberally construing it, as this Court many
fc: mac has said must be done, indeed ia useful to examine
other information which subsequently was revealed about
this system as illuminating what in fact this complaint was
talking about.

The complaint, in accordance with the

federal rules, was a short and plain statement.

It did not

give evidence or detail of the allegations.
Indeed, what we’re talking about is the evidence
which would later be used to demonstrate in fact that the
plaintiffs could prove their complaint.

We do not believe

*

that that information is essential to the question of
justiciability except insofar as it does illuminate what
the plaintiffs were complaining about.

Q

I thought you were going to say you might put

evidence on along the same line.

MR. bSKH$;

Mr. Justice Marshall, it was our

They were not permitted to testify.

MR. ASKIN's

Yes, Mr. Justice,

at v;o are explaining

a generalised system which

Togo not focus concretely on these plaintiffs.

Indeed,

hois system did focus concretely on the plaintiffs.
;•>!; ...n.nfiffs vane 'atched by military agents.

The

You might take

koa situation of: one of our plaintiffs, Mr. Conrad Lynn.
A military agent apparently went to a meeting at a
Unitarian church in Philadelphia at which Mr. Lynn spoke.
He filed a report over the Amy teletype system to Fort
Holahird which, among other things, identified Mr. Lyrm as
the author of draft evasion literature.

We allege that that

information goc.u into the Amy’s data bank at

'Holahird,,;

Ti:.it information is then picked up, sent out over

the Army's teletype system on their weekly summary, which
is what it at‘inched as an exhibit to the complaint, to other
military installations all over the country.

And it’s then

taken and put in their mini-banks at these various other
military installations.

So, this is something other than

plaintiffs «>. r;>ly complaining about soma generalised

system.

Th.ir; is a s, -ten which', in fact, very intimately affected
them and foci's .sed upon them.

That' s why I believe the

Solicitor General has in fact misrepresented our allegations
us indeed with the other.allegations we said clandestine
operations.

28
In cur erbibits to the complaint, for example,

it is s-'ic' but. amosg other 'things tie military went fco the

rngistrax at a university to gather confidential information

But indeed we were limited ini our knowledge,

Of

We saw,

an has been said before, only the very tip of the iceberg.

We did not have the full details as they ultimately emerged,
of course, in Senator Ervin’s committee.

We could only put

forth in our complaint as much of the detail as we in fact
knew at that time in addition to the breed outlines of the
system as it was functioning.
Q

Mr. Askin, suppose that if instead, of sending

agents the military t'er whatever reason relied upon
newspaper clipping services and just identified certain
people and certain organisations', and had a clipping service
and fed them into their data banks.

Would you feel that that

had violated some constitutional rights of the persons
affected?

Q

Of course, Mr. Chief Justice.. that Pi

On the merits it would be a different case.
these were all public meetings, ware they not?

MS= &3KINs

Well, the mootings we're talking about

in the exhibit to the complaint were public meetings.

We

h'i'v'G made allegations! -chat they were also gathering
ij

'

deer kinds of clandestine methods*

If th

ware

ily moirg the kinds of clipping you were saying—but

still if they were maintaining data banks and were still
disseminating information on individuals and still compiling
what w& referred to as a blacklist, what they've called an
index list, i would believe that still would be a justiciabl
controversy.

The ultimate result on the merits might turn

out. different, but 1 would say that there would still be a
justiciable controversy if in fact this system did focus on
those particular plaintiffs .

They would have a right, claim

' a i i < ’ 1 \: <:i u'Li1 b c j 'i: a t i o:. a;J:s 1 o and then would have to go back
for a hearing on the merits as to whether or not the Army
indeed could do it.
Based on the cl.aims that we have put forth, our
vmconfcested allegations, we insist that there is really no
qu aation that p1aintiffs are entitled to a hearing, that the
to the justiciability question must be the same one
given by this Court in a series of celebrated, cases over the
past dozen years, in each of which government defendants
argue that this Court should close its eyes and close its
ears to serious violations of constitutional rights.

We

refer to Baker w. Carr, Kwlckler v. Koota, Powell v„

If is unlikely' we'll ever be more right, that anyone else

So, despite the Army5& denials- it is

asserting that the military surveillance operation is in
fact unreviewable.

And such a result would make

constitutional rights a nullity.

And, Hr. Chief Justice, as you yourself reminded
us in your dissent in Biwins last year, without some
effective ssnccion constitutional protections aged, nst

MR. AS KIN t

Well, Hr. -Justice Stewart, on the

question of—first of all, it is unlikely that any
particularly plaintiff, any particular individual, is ever

He would never know, Mr. Justice.

in many of the decisions of this Court.

If he were denied

coin Id show that he was hurt.
MR. Af-KIN:

But indeed it's very unlikely that

ouch a person would ever know why it was that he lost that

job.

This system operates in such a way that they don't

have a

justiciable controversy here that is right for adjudication.
But that question of whether the Array may do it is not
before the Court at this time.

Of course,

I would say this issue

And indeed to hold otherwise, to grant the Army the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAM J. ERVIN, JR., ESQ.,
OK BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ERVINs

There are laws on the statute books

which make the use of the Array for the purposes for which
it is used in talc case illegal.

Article I, Section 8,

of the Constitution empowers Congress to make rules for
■tire government

md regulation of land and naval forces and

to provide for tailing out the militia to enforce the laws
of the Union, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion,
Article IV, Section 4, of the Constitution provides that
ted Stat

■

1 protect each state against domestic

so cl one s if if is requests^ to do so by the legislature or
o

the governor in nose the legis lature is not in session.

Cc Agrees. ha;? etsrcieed this power to lay down rules for the.
goverrment of the armed forces in the posse comitatus act
which war enacted in 1873 as a result of the use ci the
carry in 70 communities in South Carolina to enforce laws
ar.d as a result of the practice of United States Marshals
fcc call on the Army for contingents to assist, in the
enforcement of laws.
This? statute says this;

whoever, except in cases

and under circumstances expressly authorized by the
Constitution or an act of Congress - willfully uses the Army—
and it has .or; been amended, the Mr Force, any part of the

Army or Air L'-crco-'-as a posse comitatus or otherwise to
execute the 1pm shall be fined not more than $10,000 and
imprisoned rot pore than two years or both.
New, manifestly that statute forbids the use of
the Army foe police purposes and police purposes including
detective work.

So, it forbids the use of the Army for

detective work.

There are three statutes which Congress has

passed.

Sections 331, 332, and 333 of Title 18 of the

United States Code which allowed the President to use the
armed forces to suppress rebellion, insurrection, and
.o lence of a higher magnitude..

The first of these

.t 1j3 is in h&l'i&f with Article Tv f Section &f of the

35
Cono

j rid provides the President c'an use the armed

forces to suppress an insurrection against the state if
it's requested by state authorities so to do.

The second

provides that the President can use the armed forces to
suppress a rebellion against federal authority which
impedes the enforcement of the federal lews by the normal
force of action in the judicial proceedings.

And the third

provides that the President can use the armed forces where
there is such domestic violence within the borders of

a

state that it impedes the execution of federal and state
laws to such ar. extent that a class of citizens is deprived
of a right named in the Constitution and secured by law
.and the state refuses or fails or is unable to suppress the
insurrection or the domestic violence.
These statutes are subject to limitation which is
ample here.

It says before the President can invoke any one

of these three statutes to use the armed forces, that the
President must issue a proclamation calling upon the
insurgents, it calls them, to disburse and to return to their
places of abode within a reasonable time.

That's the

conditions under which the Army can be used, and these
conditions didn't exist with reference to these plaintiffs.
Manifestly, if the President can’t use armed
fevuw; v-"- the issues of public proclamation, the Army cannot
be used as a detective force as it was used in this case,

continued as follows.!

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Senator, you may

proceed,
Ha.» e:,'C/IN s

The government * s argument and brief

Cakes & leaf out of the notebook of the old lawyers who used
to file speak and demurrers.

They ask this Court to

determine the sufficience of the complaint not on the
allegations of the complaint but on the allegations of some
affidavits which were originally relevant to opposition to
the motion cf the plaintiffs in the District Court for a
preliminary injunction.
presented to this Court,

They are not relevant to the question,
When the complaint in this case

is interpreted in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs
art! all doubts are resolved in their favor, as the rule
applicable to a challenge to the sufficience of a complaint

requires, this complaint makes these allegations.

First,

Second,

that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated are
aceful fashion their First
rights to freed era of speech, association, assembly, end
petition, to expires their dissent, convert others to their
views, and persuade government to alter the policies to
which they dissent.

Third, that although the plaintiffs

and others similarly situated are exercising their First
hr'eriament rights peaceably, the Array has required 1,000
ligenc

300 at

throughout the nation and additional intelligence units
where all the substantial forces of the Army are stationed
to exercise surveillance both overt and covert over the
plaintiffs and that these military intelligence agents and

stated, and ifh's damaging their reputations and imperiling

hands of the federal government or o

Fifth, that.the

activities of. the Army exceed any legitimate needs of the
Army and are not authorized by law.

Sixth, that plaintiffs

have no adeguata remedy at law, and unless and until the Court
