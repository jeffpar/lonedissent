OREL ARGUMENT OP JACK GREENBERG, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GREENBERG;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case is hare on certiorari to the Supreme Court
of Georgia, and it raises, in another context, the questions
of the two preceding eases, and that is, whether the imposition
and carrying out of the death penalty in the case of one
convicted of the crime of rape constitutes cruel and unusual
pun.' skment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments
to. the United States Constitution.
The petitioner, Lucious Jackson, was sentenced to
death for the crime of rap© by the Superior Court of Chatham
County, Georgia, in 1968.

The conviction was upheld by the

Stave Supreme Court against the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment
challenges.
Petitioner is a 21-year-old black escaped convict,
who had been sentenced to a three-year term for automobile
theft.

He was out of captivity for a period of three days,

G ::. while out of captivity he allegedly committed several
vr:GG:S as well as the rape for which he was convicted.

4
The State’s evidence was that he broke into the home
of. a ahite housewife, the wife of a physician, threatened her
with a p; ‘

of scissors, stole five dollars and some change,

engaged in a physical

struggle with her, raped her, escaped

whan the maid arrived, and hid in a neighbor's garage for
several hours, where ha was found.
The prosecutrix, in addition to having been raped,
suffered some abrasions and lacerations, but no additional
injury appeared.
The petitioner was indigent and represented by courtappointed counsel.

Apart from pretrial motions asking for

appointment of a psychiatrist, change of venue, and a continu­
ance to allow time to prepare the case, the' defense presented
no evidence.
The trial, including a separate proceeding held in
the morning to determine petitioner’s competence to stand
trial, lasted one day.
The jury knew only the State’s evidence and that
petitioner is a Negro.
to death.

And on this record it sentenced him

The jury acted under Georgia law, Section 26-1302,

which appears on page Xa of our brief, which is that — it
■was at that: time? it’s been changed slightly — that:
‘The crime of rape shall be punished by death, unless

r? jury roccu.uends mercy, in which event punishment shall fee
i:-E.v-,r for life:

Provided, however, the jury in all

5
cases may fix the punishment by imprisonment and labor in the
penitentiary for not less than one year nor

more than 20 yearn»

In the. two cases just argued, Aiksns and Furman, the
petitioners urged that the death penalty in cases of homicide
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment»

Here, too, in this

case we urge that the death penalty in the case of rape
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment»
And for a moment 1 would like to focus on the word
“unusual".

Infliction of capital punishment for rape is indeed

■'•.ha most unusual of punishments for any crime in the United
States or, indeed, in the world.
lit this point I am going to speak for a moment about
racial statistics.

There have been some questions about racial

statistics and statistics that may or may not be judicially
noticeable.

All the statistics that I will relate come from

'national Prisoner Statistics, a publication of the United
States Department of Justice.
The figures are so overwhelming that? at a minimum,
if they're not conclusive, they cast the burden upon the
respondent to explain them.

This is not strange in a racial

..seise, in cases involving juries, schools, employment, voting?
figures speak, as the Fifth Circuit said in another context,
and judges listen.

And sometimes the figures are not

persuasive, sometimes they3re conclusive.

At a minimum, if
i

they're sufficiently persuasive, they cast the burden of

6

explanation upon the other s5.de.
Our opponents have said in their brief and have
said in argument, with regard to other aspects of statistics
in these cases, that there are many questions that the
statistics leave unanswered.

For example, in a rape case,

has the death penalty been inflicted because the defendant is
a particularly vicious person?

Was the crime committed by a

group of people? Was a weapon used?

Was an injury inflicted?

Did the victim have a particular reputation for chastity?
Was there a child, involved?

And so forth.

We have attempted to answer these questions in
another litigation in the State of Georgia, Williams v, Georgia,
in which petition for writ of certiorari is now pending before
this Court.

The law of the State of Georgia, as declared by

the Supreme Court of Georgia in the Williams case, is that the
explanations are inadmissible.
Wi3..llama v. Georgia, 1 might say, is reported at
173 S.E. 2d, 72„
The explanations of the statistics, which we have
attempted to put into evidence by testimony, an analysis of
a representative sample of the rape cases in the State of
Georgia over a 20-year period, is that it is inadmissible.
wo vould say that the figures that I'm about to discuss
are probably, undoubtedly conclusive on their face; but if

th .*

. . s- any explanations to be made they should come from the

7
State of Georgia not from the respondents who have made an
effort to answer these figures»
The crime of rape is punished capitally in fch©
Southern States only.

There is or was an exception in the

State of Nevadaf which punished rape by death where bodily
harm was done.

That statute has been invalidated. And so it

is a Southern phenomenon only.
Q

How was that statute invalidated, by court or

by special ~~
MR. GREENBERGS By Court.
Q

Upon what basis?

MR. GREENBERG:

1 believe it was invalidated on

something that came to the U. S. v. Jackson grounds.
Q

Yes.

.i. GREENBERG:
the South overwhelmingly.

It is visited upon black people in
There have been 455 executions for

rap:: since statistics have been kept. And of the 455 men put
to death, 405 have been black.
At the moment there ara 73 men on Death Row awaiting
execution for the crime of rape.

Of the 73, 62 are black, one

is a Mexican, one is an Indian, and the race of three is not
known to us.
That means that historically, since figures were
kept, and at the present time the execution rate, for the
crime of rape runs approximately at the rate of 90 percent

8
black defendants put to death or being held on Death Row to
be put to death.
In the State of Georgia.. 61 men have been put to
death for the crime of rape since statistics were kept.
those 61, 58 have been black.

Of

The Georgia statistics run

somewhat higher, at about a rate of 95 percent.
Now, in the case of Williams v, State of Georgia,
and in two other cases pending in the State of Georgia, there
have been efforts to examine these statistics in considerably,
more detail.

All of these matters are pending in the courts

in the State of Georgia, and the Williams case is pending
here as a matter of fact.
In the case, Mitchell v. Smith, pending in the court
of, I think, Tattnall County, the statistics ware developed at
vary c ot sic1.arable length. And it was demonstrated that in
cases where a black man rapes a white woman, 38 percent, of the

defendants ware sentenced to death.

In a case where any other

racial combination was involved, one-half or one percent of the
defendants were sentenced to death.
.low, these are the States where, as is well-known and
I need not elaborate on this, where there has been for many

years, until outlawed by this Court and other courts, racial
segregation in schools and various aspects of public life ware
required v,. permit it, these are also the States, and I think
it's much, .-ore cXcr-.lv to the point, which have antimiscegena-

3

ticm laws,- until they were outlawed by the Loving cage, and
there5s a long footnote in the Loving case which details which
of the States had those laws. These also considerably overlap
the States which have capital punishment for rape.
Nov/, in the rest of the world, and I. think that's not
an inadmissible consideration to take into account, capital
punishment for rape is authorised only in South Africa, Malawi,
aaci Taiwan.

That is, throughout the entire world, certainly

throughout the entire Western World which shares our culture,
throughout the entire English-speaking world which shares our
jurisprudencef throughout the entire United States, throughout
the Southern part of the United States with the exception of
black men, very slight exception for small handful of white
men who suffered that penalty, capital punishment for rape
is a penalty so rare that X think the word "unusual* is
perhaps an understatement of the frequency with which it
appears.
It's difficult to think of a punishment which is mere
unusual than capital punishment for rape.
It’s unusual, when looked at from another point of
view:

in Ralph v. Warden, the ease decided by the United

States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which invalidated
capital punishment for rape in certain circumstances, Judge
Butzner sets forth the fact that between 1960 and 1968 there
were 190,730 reported cases of rape.

Now, by 1971 and 1972,

10
of course, the figuras are higher.

Yet at that time there were

only 70 men on Death Row for tits crime.

And the disproportion

is, to say the least, staggering.
And so the punishment if cruel and unusual in any
sense of those words.
Now*, the State of Georgia particularly, the outcome

which I have described here, may not be strange, in fact may be
entirely to be expected.
Here is a legislative history of the Georgia statute,
which casts considerable light on its reasons for its enactment,
and the way it is operated.
Before the Civil War in the State of Georgia there
were two sets of statutory penalties for the crime of rape.
If a slave or a free person of color raped a white woman, he
was to get the death penalty? any other rape was punishable
by a term of one to twenty years.
After the Civil War, the statutory scheme which was
on the boohs of the State of Georgia was repealed and
essentially the statutory scheme that we have at this point
was re-enacted to talcs its place.
statutes

And we have all these

-1 forth verbatim in the appendix at the end of our

brief.

And the discretionary death penalty for the crime

of rape was enacted into Georgia law.

And what has happened

the administration of the statute, thi s <3 i s creti onary

11
statute, has been essentially what was requiret under the
particular language of the Georgia legislation that existed
prior to the Civil War,
Looking at. capital punishment in general, that is,
for the crime of rape and the crime of homicide, we find that
while it is authorised for one purpose or another in most of
the States, it is in fact almost never applied, except in a
random, unstandardised way against the poorest, the least
educated, ana disproportionately against racial minorities»
The figures can be put together in various ways»
It might be said, as has been said fey; some counsel this
morning, that most of the States authorise capital punishment
for one crime cr another.
Another way of looking at it is if one takas the
past decade, in 1962, and takes tha States where there have
been no executions, and going to the past decade one does not
one is not confined to the period of time in which judicial
stays have been dominating the picture; if one takes the past
decade, one finds 24 States in which there has not been an
execution /here executions might be permitted. One finds nine
States in which capital punishment has been completedly
abolished i making 33 States or 65 percent of the States of the
Union which yeither have exercised nor permit capital punish­
ment for any crime.

And the overwhelming number of juris-

X think we have —

death. Do you know, of those 42?
MR, GREENBERG;

I think we have a table here.

are so many statistics in all these cases.

MR. GREENBERG;

C'

— say —« my question was on what you’re talking

about right now, as to what there are.
MR. GREENBERGYe s.
Well ~~
Q

I can get it later.

MR. GREENBERGs

Yes.

Having spoken of the question

of unusualness, just a word or two about the issue of
cruelty.
We would submit that if the word means anything at
all in plain English, and an analysis of a constitutional
legislative provision, while it doesn’t end with — or may end
with, but must start with the reading of the plain language.
The taking, the intentional taking of a life of ex
prisoner who is held in captivity and has been held, there for
years, it is, by any plain understanding of that, cruel.
And I think tot the framers of the Bill of Rights
recognized that.

They may not have thought it was unusual,

but Mr. Livermore, in the debates on the Bill of Rights, in
our brief it’s set forth on 7d, and seme of the — very little
legislative history — spoke about the cruel and unusual
clause, and he said?
be inflicted»

“No cruel and unusual punishment is to

It is sometimes necessary to hang a man, villain

-."?ften deser.'ve whippings and perhaps having their ears cut off,

14
but are we, In the future, to he prevented from inflicting
these punishments because they're cruel?”
They were recognised to be cruel, whipping and cutting
off the ears was not recognized as being unusual»
Now it is unusual, unusual for any cause and even
more unusual for .'the crime of rape»
As to sometimes the meaning of the terra is confined
to mode of punishment', that is, is gassing or electrocution or
hanging cruel?

As to that there are materials set forth in

our brief, .but if the case is to be reduced to the issue of
whether or not the particular mode of execution is cruel,
there, at a minimum, ought to be, we submit, an evidentiary
hearing which has been asked for in some of these cases, and
discussed somewhat at length in the last footnote of the brief
in the Alkans case»
In some casea, and. indeed historically we have looked
at the* question of proportionality or disproportionality t
it excessive to take a man's life for any crime or for the
crime of rape?
And that raises the question, we submit, of the
common view of the death penalty for rape throughout this
country and throughout the world, that is of the fitness or
the unfitness of the punishment,

And even in this sense

cruelty ana unusualness? we believe, marge, and we get back
to the question, particularly in the rape cases, of.z

Is it

Is

disproportionate to take a life for this crime whan so few
countries in the world

no other, countries in the world, and

so few States use this punishment for this crime, and then
confine it essentially to the black people»
I was handed a note here saying that on Death Row
there are now

30 men. >

one man in Arkansas and 105 in California»

Thank you.

' Bow did the one in Arkansas come to be there?

Is that since Governor Rockefeller's amnesty?
MR. GREENBERG i
Q

His amnesty covered what?

MR. GREENBERG:
Q

About twenty —

I think it was 24 men, yes.

— more or less.

MR. GREENBERG:
Q

1 would think that must be, yes.

Twenty-four men.

I suppose commutation would have been a more

accurate terra.
MR. GREENBERG:

Yes, X think so.

Yes.

These cases, while they involve the issue of capital
l.a :-yvt, also involve the role of the. Bill of Rights in
cue. const! tut Iona I scheme. They are fateful cases for racial

.Minorities, and not only for the reasons of the vast dispro-

More than the life of a

miserable handful of individuals is involved.

Ho matter how

these cases sosse out, if they are lost there will only be a
few unfortunates put to death, out of our national population
of more than 200 million souls.
’the question is, to what end?

Taking a life in the

It's a symbolic act.

Perhaps a

kind of a ritual sacrifices that tells many things.

But to

racial minorities, to black people, it tells something of
how much the law values their own individual lives.

It would not he strange if the oppressiveness, the
unov&nnesa, the cruelty, the unusualness with .which the
supreme penalty is inflicted works, in effect, on how those
minorities view the legal system.

Mrs. Beasley*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. DOROTHY T. BEASLEY,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRS, BEASLEYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

•the Court s
This Court has said, in Fahy vs, New York, in 1947,
that it would not apply the Fourteenth Amendment to standardise
the administration of justice and stagnate local variations in
practice.
And in 1959, in Williams vs, Oklahoma, it was saidt
Neither the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor
anything else in the Federal Constitution requires a State to
fix or Impose any particular penalty for any crime it may
define, or to impose the same or 'proportionate” sentences
for separate and independent crimes.
That was in 1959.
If the death penalty for the crime of rape is cruel
-and unusual, then I would submit that it is an imposition
upon the legislative enactment which has been enacted and has
been the law in Georgia since before 1851.

Rape has

consistently taken the death penalty in Georgia, and just in
I960 the Legislature again considered the penalty for rape.
1 think It's significant to note that when it did

consider the penalty in 1960 it was not whether it should or
:f: via not do

c..?e.y

with the death penalty for 'rape; but, rather

should it leave it to the discretion of the jury to make it an
alternative sentencing of one year to life, or should it be,
rather, ore to twenty years or life? and the latter was what
won out:
But there was no question, even in I960, as to
wlr.:thv;r the rrciir.r.r penalty should be the death penalty or not*
That i s the will of the people of Georgia, and there has been
nothing crown in this case which would indicate that that will
should be overborne by a construction of the United States
Constitution«
The main argument that's made is that the legislative
history of the raps statute in Georgia shows that it must be
baaed on racial considerations,

And I would submit that what

hr. Justice Blacler.ua said in Stephens, when ha was a Circuit
Judy..:, quoting Brown vs. Alias?, a 1953 case, is applicable here
The quotation was:

"Former errors cannot invalidate

future fcria1s•”
Tnd I think that’s very legitimate here, because most
cf the statistics that are taken by petitioner to allegedly
show that the only factor which goes to indicate the death
::nn&lto for rape in Georgia cases must be raca.

I think that

factors and those statistics are used from the period of
, in tThirtior and the Twenties, and the Forties, the

19

Fifties, worr perhaps there was racial discrimination , we
her1 r know? feat the cases are not looked at aa to what their
circinas•*• ancen are , or h :s heinous they are in comparison to
other rapes.

Or the proportion of persons, white or black, who
conit rapes, and mat the factual circumstances of the eases
are.
And. I think that they cannot make the presumption,
which they indicate here, that the juries are looking at rape
cases and determining that a man should suffer the death
penalty in the last analysis because only of his race.

And

that8 s the presumption which the petitioner asks this Court to
make.

I think there's no valid basis for that whatsoever.
Moreover, they don't apply it to the circumstances

in this case.

Their argument is based on generalities, that,

well, there are so many Negro men who have been executed for
rape in Georgia, and there are so many Negro men now on Death
Row in Georgia for rape, that it must be because they're black.
I think that they offer no support whatsoever to
forward that contention.

Moreover, 1 point out that among

those who arc now on Death Row *— or really not even on Death
Row, they're kept cm a different floor? we don't have a Death
Row for prisoners until they have a date sat ~~ there are two
kite men that arcs :;g : inder death penalty for the crime of
rape in Georgia.

And x would question the petitioner whether the
penalty should be imposed upon them, because, after all, their
race couldn't possibly have been involved.

So£ is it not

cruel and unusual p&hiehraient to them, too?
It couldrft be if the consideration is only one'of
S' C> Si -U

Moreover, if it is a racial consideration, the

c

contention is against a lack of equal protection, perhaps, a
discrimination that has arisen.
not proved.

But that is not shown.

It‘s

They don't meet the quality of proof that's

required* to make a prima facie case of discrimination.
Secondly, it would be, instead, an indictment
against the jury system.

It would be a presumption that the

jurors are using a prejudice against race to indicate what
4

would be an appropriate penalty.

That again does not speak

to the death penalty, per ae? but, rather, attacks the jury
system.

And I think there is no basis whatsoever given in this

case and in those briefs by the petitioner to show that that
would be so.
I'd ilka to point out also that he makes no claim of
discrimination in this case. There certainly would be many
opportunities to show it.

We have the voir dire in which any

indication-., of prejudice could have been shown. There was a
tfj.cn for

now trial, and that would have been an absolutely

r .refect place to show that the penalty was excessive under the

21
circttir.stexices of the case.

It is the usual practice to file

a motion for a new trial to indicate that the penalty or the
verdict was unjust or that it lacked equity, so that the Court
would have an opportunity to look at the penalty and see
whether# in the circumstances of the case which was before it,
it was very lively before it, not on appellate record# the Court
itself could, measure whether the penalty was excessive in that
particular case,
C
'

Can that be done in Georgia?

MRS. BEASLEYs
a

In other words, —

MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

Yes, sir.

And it's the usual practice,

In other words, if the jury comes in with a

finding of — a conviction and then imposing a sentence of
19 years in the penitentiary, counsel for the defendant can
say that it8 b way too much under the circumstances of this
offense.

He can say that
MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

Yes, under what we call the —

— after he files, and the court has power to

Chang© the verdict, does he?
MRS. BEASLEY:

It would be under what we call, the

general ore- mik; for a notion for a new trial, which would be
that either the verdict was not supported by the evidence, or
the verdict
Q

/as contrary to the evidence, —
Ho, I'm talking about the sentence? I thought

22

-

you were»
MRS» BEASLEY:

Yes»

Well, the verdict, of course,

woald be both the finding of guilty and the sentence, and that
it was unjust, or without equity.
Q

And does the trial judge have power to change it,

or only to grant a new trial?
MRS. BEASLEY:

He would have to grant a new trial

in that circumstance.
And also, of course, that would go up on an appeal,
in an appeal situation, the same *~Q

But the jury's — the sentence imposed by the

jury is final so far as it's a sentence? the trial judge doss
not have power, does ha, in Georgia, to change the sentence
as such?
MRS. BEASLEY: That's right.
is province of the jury.

That's correct.

That

And cf course the statute was written

that the penalty for rape would foe death unless it was
reccmended by the jury that it be life or that it be between
one and twenty years.
Q

Oh, I thought alternatively it could be from

one to twenty years in the penitentiary.
MRS., BEASLEY:
G

Or life.

It would be the particular —

As I understand Georgia, it's this — and you

toll re if 1*2» wrong -- if a jury finds some defendant guilty
o

rape, it can impose a sentence of imprisonment, anywhere from

23
one to twenty years in the penitentiary or it can impose a
death sentence or it can impose a sentence of life in the
pen .1 tenfciary.
MRS. BEASLEYs 'That's right.
0

Isn't that right?

MRS. BEASLEY: That's right.
Q

But it starts off

Nothing between twenty years and life, so far

as imprisonment?
MRS. BEASLEY:

No.

That was the question that arose

in the Legislature in •*■Q

That9s what I thought; in 1960.

That's what I

thought.
MRS. BEASLEY:

~ 1960.

Right.

And, moreover, not only was the question raised in
I960, but we had a complete Criminal Code revision in 1968,
.o that the question of penalties and the appropriateness of
penalties was again taken up by a Special Criminal Code
Ccmmissidn. which was reported to the Legislature.

And of

course: penalties for each of the crimes was considered by that
Commission, so that there was a reflection, certainly, of the
will of the people in that instance.
I think that you. would have to also presume, if you
agree, with the presumption that race is included, that the
juries have seme kind of conspiracy against Negro rapists, for
it to be consistent with that reason only.

But I think that

24
petitioners show no dissimilarities between those cases which
would make the only factor being race, to show that it was that
factor which made them impose the penalty.

And again I would

say that that would not go to the invalidation of the penalty,
per sor but as to the invalidation of the penalty in the
particular case.

And there has been no evidence whatsoever

in thin case which was in 1958, when Witherspoon was applied.
And certainly there would have been an opportunity to show any
jury discrimination in this case.
Petitioner says — and, by the way, one of the white
men under the death penalty in Georgia proposed, made the
position that the penalty of death was discriminatorily
imposed upon him because he was a white man, and only three
out of 65 white man had been executed for rape.
So that it just goes the other way, too; it just
depends on how you want to look at it.
And his sentence, of course, was upheld.

I had understood Mr. Greenberg's argument on

this branch of the case to foe directed primarily to the
submission that this is a highly unusual punishment; highly
unusualf and that that's, after all, what the grant of
certiorari was in these cases.

We don't have here before us any

equal protection claims —
MRS. BEASLEY:

That's right.

— but whether or not this is a cruel and unusual

punishment.

And his argument in this branch of the case was

directed, an I understood it, to submitting to the Court what
an unusual punishment it was, that it was so rarely imposed,
that when it was imposed it was imposed on an identifiable
faction of defendants.
MRS. BEASLEY:

X think his argument with regard to

it being unusual is that it’s unusual because most of the
nations of the world and most of the States in the country don't
impose it for rape.

But I think that it has to be taken into

what do they impose?

If they impose life imprisonment, that in itself is
a very severe penalty, and is the distinction between life
imprisonment and death so great that the death penalty
const!tunes a grossly disproportionate penalty for the crime of
raje?

Is rape

you have to look at the nature of the. crime,

anc I think that's one of the great fallacies in the arguments
that have .been presented by the petitioner in this case.
They looked only at the criminal, they don't look at
the totality, at society too; and I think that Mr. Justice
«%
Cardoso, in Bnydar vs. Massachusetts, pointed this out very
cl-.arly.

He said:

But justice, though due to the accused, is

argument and doesn’t have anything to do with the abstract

Q

That's not here.

Q

What percentage of defendants who are convicted

of rape are given the death penalty in Georgia?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Mr. Justice White, I don't know what

the percentage would be.
£

Let’s assume it was one in a hundred.

MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

I think that —

Let's just assume that it was one in a hundred

rapists, convicted rapists, who got the death penalty.
MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

Unh-hunh.

I'm not saying those are the figures, but let's

assume it.
MRS. BEASLEY:

Xf there were true, then I think we

would have to look at the circumstances of the crime.

The

Well, let's make a further assumption that in

all —the circumstances of all 100 cases were identical.
MRS. BEASLEY: That still leaves it up to the jury,
under our system.
Well. 1 know it does.

But would you say then

tnb:- infliction of the death penalty was unusual?
MRS. BEASLEY:

1 think not

It would depend on what

tfc . other impositions were.

I think if all of the other

punishments that were given were a term of twenty years, then
perhaps the death penalty would be unusual for that one case,
0

Wall, then, —*

MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

But if —

else was given twenty years,

that everyone

We're not talking equal protection

hers but 2*m just talking about whether the imposition of the
death penalty is unusual.
MBS. BEASLEY;

It may very well ba if there was only

one out of a. hundred, and that was consistent throughout
history.
Q

Well, why would you deem that unusual?

MRS. BEASLEY:

Because it was so rare that it never

came up except once.
Q

Well, but wouldn’t you say --

MRS. BEASLEY:

Again I would say that that would not

naJcn it constitutionally unusual, cruel and unusual, because
again it would be within the legislative boundaries that were
set for that punishment.
, So you would say no matter how rare, no matter
how ro.re the imposition of the death penalty is, the State
has the power to invoke that?
MRS. BEASLEY:

accorded.

Yes.

So long as due process is

o

Well, 1 assms due process in the sense of

procedural fairness.
MRS. BEASLEYs

Vo'; » sir.-

Then 1 think it would not

be constitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.

Do you give any separate context to "cruel1" as

distinguished from " unusual **’?
MRS. BEASLEYs
meaning.

Yes.

I think it has a different

It indicates pain rather than how often the particular

punishment is imposed.

I think the context in which “cruel”

is used is one indicating lingering death,, for example, or
torture«
Q

Well, what ' about — what about banishment?

MRS. BEASLEY: Since that's not used at all, it would
foe unusual.
Q

Xf it were used once out of a hundred times, if

the State would have the power to do it?
MRS. BEASLEY:
11'

I'm not sure whether it would or not.

.Fourteenth Amendment says that the State may not deprive

a parson of life, liberty, or of property without due process

of law, which means, to me, that it may deprive him with due
process of low, of life or of liberty or of property? and
banishment would not be included.

It would not be an acceptable

form of punishment in the context of our system of justice.
Q

So your

MRS. BEASLEY

Mb; t type, it would be a type of

31
punishment that is outside of our scheme.
So your answer to the rarity of the imposition

of capital punishment for rape is# first, that even if it's
very rare., the State has the power to retain it?

MRS. BEASLEYs

I think that was in a Southeastern

basis or on a national basis? but X haven’t seen figures on
Georgia itself. State by State.

Q

Well, he purported to give us the figure on

Georgia, 1 thought.
MRS. BEASLEY:

I don’t recall him saying so.

If he

did, I'd like to know what it is.
I don’t expect that there is — has been a recent
figure. And of course it would only be a recent figure that
would show how unusual it would be. in terms of this case.
Q

But oven if it wore one in a hundred, only one

in a hundred, you would say the State has the power to impose
it?
MRS. BEASLEYs
Q

Yes, indeed.

X understood you to say that you did have a

second string to your constitutional argument, Mrs. Baaslev?
perhaps I misunderstood you.

But in response to the question

When

ynn said that: yes, it would be, if it were only one in a thousand

that would be with extra; rciinary rarity; but that that didn't
mean it was unusual within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment,
And 2 gather that you meant that that word in the Eighth
Airiendiaent meant something other than just rare; that it meant
something like some sort of an exotic or offbeat sort of
method of punishment, and you —*

MRS. BEASLEY:

X think it does.

you mentioned banishment.

•‘1

add a second string to your bow.

MRS. BEASLEY;

No.

I thought you did

Did I misunderstand you?

I think, indeed, that's exactly

what it means.

Q

3; thought so.

MRS. BEASLEY; Because we talked in both the Fifth and
the Fourteenth Amendment, of taking life and taking property
and taking lib arty, which of course means imprisonment.
we don't talk about anything else,»

But

So it applies the limitation

to those things under the terms of our system of criminal
justice, and other things, like torture or banishment, would
be outside of it..

In most instances.

But, by the same token, the things that are within
in

deprivations of life or liberty or property would not be

unusual unless, of ecmssR, it was never used for that particular
crime.
?©r example, if you used the death penalty for
■ y,

only one State used it, that might be unusual;

34
because it was not at common lav; — well, it was.

That's not

a good example.
But 1 think you see what X mean.

The usefulness of

the three types of penalties was taken for granted and was
certainly, even more than that, was put right into the
Const!tution.
Q

By three types, you mean deprivation of life,

MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

— deprivation of property, —

MRS, BEASLEY2
Q

Life, —

— liberty, —

and deprivation of liberty?

MRS. BEASLEY2
about deprivation of life.

Right.

And then it becomes only a matter

Tha petitioners here nay that it5a excessive for rape,
although they rlo go a step further and say:

MRS. BEASLEYs
Q

Well, in the abstract principle.

Yes.

MRS. BEASLEYs

That's right,

But he doesn’t go so

far as to say, well, if it’s not excessive in all cases, then
it*s excessive in this one,
Q

Yes,

MRS, BEASLEY;

And 1 think for good reason, I don't

think that he could show that it was.
Q

What would bs your answer if the statistic in

Georgia showed that the only people in the history of Georgia
ever given the death penalty in rape -were Mexicans or Negroes?
Would your argument be the same?
LRS. BEASLEY;

If there were true, X would say that

.a would again have to look at the circumstances of the crime,
that if ho could show -** make out what this Court has termed a
prims facie case of discrimination in sentencing, then, of
course, it would be on an individual case basis; the penalty
would be invalid.
And if, aa a result, no jury •

• convicted or sentenced

a white man, or no jury sentenced a black man again for the
crime of rape ~-

Q

Wei1

my cas a is that no jury has ever sentenced

36

any white man for rape, and every Negro convicted of rape had
been sentenced to deatht

Yea wouldn't have any problem with

that ?
MBS. BEASLEYi That probably would be a prima facie
case.
Ci

Safe that's not this case, that's your point.

MRS. BEASLEY! That's not this case, and, moreoverf
it has nothing to do with whether the death penalty is cruel
and unusual punishment.
I think in all of this, I mentioned just a moment
before, that we have to look also at the crime and not only at
tho criminal.

As was said in a recent case of State vs.

?

Basacla in New Jersey in. 1371, X think this is pertinents
"The first raght of the individual is to foe protected
from attack*

That is why we have governmentv as the Preamble

uo th-s Federal Constitution plainly says.

In the words of

Chicago vs. Sturgas, a 1911 United States Supreme Court case,
primarily governments exist for the maintenance of social
order«

Hence it is that the obligation of the government to

protect life, liberty, and property against the conduct of the
indifferent, the careless, and the evil-minded may be
regarded as lying at the very foundation of the social compact,
''The Bill of Rights was not intended to deny that
primary mission.
*- i 1 i ii*

This is not to belittle the inestimable right

consecrated, but rather to say that those rights may not

•***

a

be road to defeat the very reason of government itself."
The government in these cases has determined that
rape and murder, under the circumstances of these cases,bear
the death penalty as the maximum; and we maintain that they
should be retained as penalties.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JACK GREENBERG, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GREENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Counsel for respondent has conceded that if, of the 61
'persons put to death for the crime of rape, all 61 had been
black, then she said there would be what you call the prima
facie case, that there was some sort of specific racial
incidence to the penalty.
Well, the facts are 58 out of 61, and I submit that3s
a difference that is just de minimis.
Q

Well, Mr. Greenberg, didn't she add to that

Nov?, what kind, Mr. Greenberg?

MR. GREENBERGi Well, we conducted a very extensive
study of capital punishment over the past twenty years in
most of the Southern States, including the State of Georgia.
And every possible factor that could occur to human imagination
that might affect a juror in coming to a conclusion on the
penalty was put into the study of every single record in all
ef these cases. They were all examined.
The viciousness of the crime; whether a group of —

MR. GREENBERGs

This was subjected to statistical

My question was only prompted by what, 1 am sure

you would concede,that the crime of rape covers a very wide
spectrum.

It can go from an extremely heinous sort of a crime

to the other extreme involving, let*s say, an adult woman and
her former boyfriend, or something like that —
MR. GREENBERG: Right.
q

— which is — and that, and as I've — and at

the heinous extreme it doss generally involve a stranger,
Right?
MR. GREENBERG: But on the matter of evidence that
goes to the penalty, in Georgia's single-verdict procedure, that
sort of evidence, as we understand the Georgia law, is not
admissible.

What may ba considered on a motion for new trial

is the evidence in the case in general —

The circumstances of that particular case,

MR. GREENBERG: The circumstances of that particular
case.

But other evidence might possibly go to sentencing,

such as, let's say, the mental state of the defendant in the
