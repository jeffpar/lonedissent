ORAL ARGUMENT OF IELAND R. SE1NA, JR.. ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SEINAs

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please

idle Courts
Hie Sierra Club brought this proceeding against the
Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior, and their assistants,
to establish

that their plans to authorize a huge private recreational

develcpnant at Mineral King in Sequoia National Game Refuge, and
for a State highway across Sequoia National Park to reach that
development were illegal.
The Club argued that unless temporarily enjoined, the
implementation of those plans would cause irreparable harm to the
special conservation interests of the Club and to the public.
The District Court, after two days of hearings, granted
a preliminary injunction.

The government appealed, and the Ninth

Circuit reversed it, denying the Club standing end then finding
the District Court erred in upholding the Club m tha merits.
The order dissolving the injunction has been stayed
pending ihs outcome of this case? and this Court granted the Club's
petition for certiorari on February 22, 1971.
The case presents several key issues, including, firsts

4
whether the Sierra Club may have standing for itself and the
public to challenge violations of laws which would injure, its
long-held aesthetic and canservational interests in Mineral King
in Sequoia National
Seconds

Park?
Vhether -the Secretary of the Interior may

permit the State of California to build an operate a new cx^necting
link freeway across Sequoia National Park, when it serves no park
purpose?
•Ihirds Whether Congress has limited the sise of long­
term developments in national forests to SO acres?
Fourths

Whether the Secretary of Agriculture may

authorize a huge recreational development in a game refuge?
Mineral King is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
appro^dnatcly 225 miles north of Los Angelas.

It is a portion of

a 15,000-acre game refuge which Congress created in 1926 —Q

Now, is the 15,000 acres the large area that you've

got outlined, or is it the white area?

The road — the smaller road is an

The road that is in heavier mark is that which is

proposed to contact the State highway here# across Sequoia National
Park team, to dead-end at Mineral King here.
Q

And when yon say that it; serves no park purpose,

do you mean that it is — its only purpose is to serves the white
area which is not part of the park?
MR. SHU';A;
Q

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice»

Merely an access?

MR. SHLNAs

That's correct,

Walt Disney Productions has described Mineral icing,
and I'm quoting from the Appendix at page 52a, as "unsurpassed in
ui'-

.1 splendor,

perhaps more similar to the European Alps

than any other area in the United States."

And "generously

endeared with lakes, streams, cascades, caverns and matchless
mountain vistas."
In 1969 the Forest Service accepted a proposal fran .
Disney for a huge resort development at Mineral King. Disney
was to construct hotels, lodges, restaurants, and other permanent
facilities so that 14,000 persons could ski at Mineral King at one
time.
Sane of those permanent features, including ski-lifts,
parking and sewage disposal facilities, and roads, among oilier

6
tilings c would not fit on the 80 acres, which is the limit of
Agrieiilture's tsxm authority, under 16 U. S. Cede 497.
The District Court found that up to 1,000 acres would
be occupied and affected by the development.
Agriculture planned to get around tliat limit of 497 by
issuing a second interlocking permit, relying on 3.6 U. S. Cede
Section 551, xvhich authorizes him to make rules and regulations for
the National Forests,
Not, the read tliat we spoke of tliat*s in existence is
only partially paved.

It was in existence when the park was

created, and has served Mineral King for 90 years.

To solve the

problem of transporting 14,000 persons at one time to Mineral King
was a problem, and the State of California agreed to construct a
high-standard freeway to dead-end at Mineral King, provided tliat
it could cut across the park.
The State rejected other avenues as longer and more
costly.

The Secretary of the Interior finally acquiesced in the

highway, although it would not serve a park purpose.
lie also was prepared to issue a permit for a highvoltage transmission line across the park to serve Mineral King»
The Sierra Club has worked to preserve the lands at

h
Sequoia National Park and Mineral King since its founding.

It

helped draw tin boundary lines and to work out the compromise
which established the game refuge in 1926.
As an incident of the Club5 s interest in the area, same

7
of ite members use Mineral King.
Q

Dees the record shew that?

MR. SELN&s

Mr. Justice Blackmun, tlie record contains

a letter iiidi is written by

a member of tee Board of Directors

of the Sierra Club, in. wliidh he in turn refers to his trips to
Mineral King.
The public record, which is referred to at page 30 of
our brief, in footnote 3, refers to testimony in 1920 before the
house Ccmraitteo on Public Lands, in white Stephen Mather, Director
of the Park Service, refers, down about halfway in the footnote,
"The Sierra Club members probably knew that area better now than,
any other living people.

They go in there nearly every year, a

club of about 2,000 members, and they know every nook and comer
of it.*'
Q

But there isn’t any direct testimony by members

of the Club anywhere in the record, is there?
MR. SELNAs
Mr.. Justice Blackmon?
Q

Direct testimony concerning their use,
Mo, there is not.

And this goes bade to tha days of John Muir,

doesn't it?
MR. SELMA%
Q

Yes, it does.

All right.

MR. SELMAs

CcFutvsncirg in 1963 the Club sought public

hearings to challenge tlxe project, white threatened to seriously
impair its conservation program, and to harm tee public interest

8
in conserving these special lends.

But the Secretary of

Agriculture refused to conduct those hearings, and without them
he promised to issue tlie two interlocking permits to Disney.
Those permits were to become effective when the State of California
let a contract for hiyliway construction, and with -chose permits
Disney would have canmenced -the bulldozing and earth-^voviny
which. would have caused irreversible change at Mineral King.
The Secretary of Interior inns about to issue that
highway permit, which would have triggered the entire project,
when the Sierra Club filed this action,
Vfe first argue that the Sierra Club had standing, too.
Our success on this issue, though, without more, would leave
unresolved significant national questions of public land manage­
ment.

It also would leave intact the Ninth Circuit’s predisposition

of merits in this case.
Vfe therefore argue fhatthe highway across idle park and
tire Disney development would be illegal.

Vfe will not argue

orally concerning the failure of the Secretary of the Interior
to

ccskfcct hearings on the park highway, concerning the transmission

line across the park and concerning the standards supplied by the
Ninth Circuit in dissolving- the preliminary injuction.

lh.ese

matters have been fully briefed.
This Court decided in toe Data Processing case in 1970
y.

aggrievcuicct to aesthetic cooservaticnal, recreational, as

well as economic values could sustain standards.

The Court in that case cited the Scenic_lit torn,Prt^rva*-»
i'i.ca Ccaiference and Office of Ccxmynicafcj.m of the United Church of
Christ cases.

Those were cases in viiich organisations , aestivetic

or ccnservational , or recreational interests were sufficiently
aggrieved to permit them to represent the public interest.

Cases

very comparable with this*
This Court, this year, granted the Sierra Club8 s standing
in taking jurisdiction of the Citisgris to Preserve Overton Park ys.
Vbjxe case, to enforce the conservations! proposes of Federal Highway
Aid statutes.
All of these cases confirm the Sierra Club’s standing
here*

The Club meets the standing tests of Sato Processing.

It

provides a more chan adequate assurance of concrete adversity*
The Club would be aggrieved or injured in fact by the
threatened acts against its conservations! interest in these lands.
I refer to its long-term efforts and to its — it’s 'had a long-term
program to preserve these lands through educational programs,
writings, and advocacy, which would have been impaired if the
development had occurred*
At the same time the development threatened the public’s
interest in preserving our natural .resources for present and future
generations.
The Club is within the zone of interest of toe relevant
statutes.

Vie will see that 16 U. 3* Code Section 1 protects

Sequoia National Park in its present state, in its natural state.

10
Section 437 protects the national Forests against
overdsvelqsgnent.

Section 688 protects wildlife and its habitat

in 'die game refuge.
All of these are conservation statutes.

All of then

protect the public interest which is shared by the Club.
Third# none of these statutes precludes judicial

review.
Q

Hew old is this Club?

MR. SSUSlAs

Q

It‘s over 70 years old# Mr. Justice Stewart*

It has about 78,000 marchers?

MR. SEIKae

It had at the time the action was filed.

X believe at this time -there are over 100#000 members.

Q
go,

I was just wondering how far your argument: would

7Jm. reminded of these so-called clubs that get chartered

airplane flights across the Atlantic Ocean# these ad hoc organisa­
tions*

Could I form a club# Friends of Walt Disney Productions#

and. cate in cn the other side as a party?
MR, SBIHAs

The question, of anybody’s standing# Mr.

Justice Brennan# ought -to be an evaluation that a court would make —
Q

My name is Stewart.

MR, SEIiSLA:
— ought

I’m sorry# Mr. Justice Stewart.

to be an evaluation which any — which the

court would have to make'on a casa-by-case basis.

a
MR. SELMA*

A variety of criteria! might be appropriate.

II
As;

Has the organization bean in existence, and has it

taken a stand over an extended period of time that's consistent
with its stand?

Has it done anything which gives it special

expertise in the area that it tries to argue about?

Does it

have an educational program?

Does it write on the subject?

Do its members use the area?

Is it adequately staffed, so that

it can present a case in a way that a court can understand it?
Q

You think all of these things would heave to be

tried cut and litigated and decided before one could decide
whether or not this organisation was a proper party?
MR., SED®.;
Q

Mr. Justice Stewart, you —

3 must say. using my analogy, like all analogies,

is not very exact perhaps, but of these clubs that charter airplanes
across the Atlantic Ocean* even with all the force of the scheduled
airlines, trying to implement policing of them, they haven't —
there hasn't been very successful policing of them?
MR, SSLHA;

Mo, Mr. Justice Stewart, but if the

concern, as I understand it ought to be, is that the Court be
assured -chat a case or esmtroversy is presented, then while an
exhaustive trial should not be necessary, or an exhaustive
litigation of the quality of the Club's position should not be
necessary, there are these criteria, which I think rather quickly and
■ather ©^sily could be determined fcy the court.
Q

Even if the club were brand-new, if it were a

club of association of people interested in

say. Friends of

12
Bigger Highways.

That was all in favor of these new highway

craiing into Mineral Fang - and. they were all friends of great
big, broad, paved highways, and they were Iona fi.de, couldn't tiisy
associate and become a party and bring a lawsuit to —
MR. SELM&s
Q

It's conceivable that they could.

In idle United Church case that you've cited,

wasn’t there a suggestion that the principal test of such an
organisation is whether it's -truly representative of the
/

interests that it seeks to assert.?
MR. SELMA?
Q

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and -»»

You claim that Sierra is truly representative of

the interests that it asserts in this case?
MR. mi
Q

We do.

Vfe do.

And the —

Then it wouldn't make any diffemice whether it

was organized last year or 70 years ago, would it. really?
MS. SELMA s

Except to the extent that the question as

to whether it's truly representative might be reflected in its age
and
Q

The 70 years tends to reinforce your claim that

it’s ~'"“
MR. SEirn:
q

—* and the 100,000 members?

MR. SELMA*
Q

Truly representative,

Yes, it does, Mr. Chief Justice.

Thy does it have to be an association?

Vvhy

couldn't it be a nan, let's make-him an old man, who, for 70 years,

has had a very genuine interest in what the Sierra Club is
interested in.

He's new 75, and hefs had this very genuine interest

f3.ijo.cE ha was five years old, for 70 years.
the satisfaction of a court.

Has had exactly the same interests

that tills bierra Club lias.
MR. SEIN&s

And he can show it to

Why couldn't he taring this lawsuit?

Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that he

could,
Q

Yes.

Q

John Muir, fear instance., if he ware still living

today?
MR. SEUffic
Q

Right.

He could do it.

Now, I take it, Mr, Selna, fron early March

you concede there is seme limitati.cn other than a broad ~~ and
that a bread general interest in the problems of ecology is not
enough.

To be more specific, if there were a controversy about

the .installation of a nuclear power plant on the Mississippi
Rivet, would you feel 'die Sierra Club would have standing to
sue in connection with that?
MR. SELNA s

Mr. Justice Blackmon, I am not at this

Moment familiar with whether the Sierra Club has a chapter or an
expertise in that area,

I would have to consult with the Club

before I could answer your question.

Bat it would have to have

competence in the area in which it sought to represent the public
interest or it wouldn't be able to do it.
New, the Ninth Circuit denied standing in this case,

14
because# and I quote frqa its opinion# ”The Club had not asserted
that any of its prc,v\. r/ Mil l > v da^oad# that its arganizaticn.
or members will be endangered# or that its status will be
threatened. *

That's in the Appendix at page 217.

These injuries to property organization of status have
nothing to do with aesthetic can^^rvational or recreational values.
They are not redressable under a. conservation statute, because while
the litigant beautifully satisfies the first test, of gate Processing»
he's injured in fact.

He's not covered by the conservation

purposes of the statute# and he's outside Ms sore of interest.
How# because the Sierra Club represents not only
itself but the public interest# the government is wrong in its
argument that injury'to the public demands a special statutory
grant in order to permit standing. The Data Processing case
almedy answered that argument# wlieh it recognized that widely
held aesthetic conservational and recreational values, which# by
their nature# affect the public# could be a basis for standing.
Its zone of interests and

reviewability tests

«apply only to vases where no special statute confers standing.
'ibid -the fact, that the interested group is bread dees not bar
standing#.- as this (Mart lias recognized .in Flast vs. Cohen in
1968 end Baker vs. Carr in 196?..
Or». t- e contrary# it's because the Club represents the
public interest that any questions regarding standing should be
resolved in its favor.

Because in this cassi;' cortervationists*

15
organizaticais may be the only people who v?ill step forward to
challenge the illegality.
The Sierra Club does not seek to review authority over
the exercise of the administration

does not seek to liave its

own review authority over toe exercise of the administrative
discretion# but asks the court to do that in which it is export#
namely, to decide whether the federal administrator stepped outside
the bounds of their statutory authority.

That review should not

be barred at the. courthouse door.
Vfe argue that the Disney development at Mineral King
would be illegal on several grounds# but# in any event# the proposed,
new high-speed access highway across the Sequoia ‘National Pork is
independently illegal.

Congress has expressly protected these

parks in their natural state, and has severely limited the use of
parklands.
The organic Act of 1316# which established the National
Park Service, included Section 16 U, S. Code Section 1, as quoted
at page 66 of our brief.

That section permits the use of parks

only — and I quote —

"By such means and. measures as conform

to the fundamental purpose of

toe

said parks, monuments,

end

reservations, which, purpose is to conserve toe scenery and the
natural and historic objections and the wildlife therein and to
provide for the enjoyment of toe same in such manner and by such
means as would
generations

leave

them, unimpaired for the enjoyment of future

16
This statute requires that any changes in parks from
their natural state ought to be in oonfomity with the park purpose.

Q

Mr. Selra, are you telling us now that there

are no roads in Sequoia National Park?

Is it just for hiking and

horseback parties* and that sort of thing?
MR. SELNAs

Mr. Chief Justice , there is a road which

is tha State highway that traverses Sepoia National Park and serves
the purpose of providing access to the park.

There is a Mineral

King road, which existed prior to the existence of the park.
Q

The one that more or less parallels the proposed

new road?
MR. SELMA?

Parallels it but on an entirely different

route.
Q

Mr. Selna, let ms ■—* l*m still struggling- — let

rae ask my question in the reverse, although I realise it’s one
that perhaps I should ask the Solicitor General.
If an. organization Mice the. Sierra Club is not qualif ied

to bring litigation of this kind, who would be?

To protect, alleged

overr.-aching by the gcwerszaent in an area of this kind where, I

take it, private plots of .land are not anywheres near the Mineral
King development?
MR. SEJ2-IA:

Mr. Jisstioe Blackmon, 5n fact there are

private holdings
Q

In there?

MR. SELNAs

—» in Mineral King.

In fact, this is an

\
17
instance where it is conceivable that there are people who —
individuals who would have an injury of a type that would cause
theft), in theoryj, to step forward.
on their doing this?

Store are practical limitations

One is that often people in these holdings

are benefitted econanlcally by the development that's about to
occur.

And any aesthetic impulse they have is overpowered by

the contrary economic impulsa.
In many ins-fences, and in the case of Sequoia National
Park itself, it's a good example.

Rkera aren't users in the sense

of people who have private holdings that would be affected one way
or the other by the deveioxxnsnt.
So, in answer to your question, if not the Sierra Club,
in many instances nobody^ or if not an environmental organization,
nobody.
Q

But in this specific case there are private

land owners up there, aren’t there?
MR. SEIN&*
Q

Yes, there are*

I was —* you can take pack trips out of there,

and they, as I've done, and there are outfitters and. so on.
MR. SELMA;

Mr, Justice Stewart, they’ve been there for

many, many years.
Q

I Icncw.

ME. SEINAs

Now, in order to give the highway a park

purpc.ce, the government argues now that the Mineral King really is
part of the park,

‘that -the statute is clear that Congress did not

include Mineral King in tbs park.
need for the highway, because the Disney Development could not be
built in Sequoia National Park.
tocl in that park*

16

u.

S« Cede, Section 45(b) , which is

set forth at page 16 of our Reply Brief, bars the use of more than
ten acres for more than 20 years for this type development.

Disney

Development violates both the space and time Hmitatxans of that
section.
51 je government urges us to disregard all of these
statutes, because the Secretary*-of the Interior ought to be able to
cooperate in such a • way 33

provide access to sanetliing that* s

legal outside the park.
In the first place, the route across Sequoia National
Park is net the only available route of access to Mineral King.
But if it ware, this argisnjant must fail.

It would permit Interior

isregard all limits on its power as long as he was acting in
aid of another governmental official.
Hor is the fact that there is a road in existence, a
legalising effect for the proposed new highway.

'Che new highway

would be huge by contrast, it would be on a different route, with
new cuts, fills, and structures, and the record shews that its
effect t;ould bn to wipe out 220 acres of virgin park land, to

err-anger Sequoia trees, and to create a barrier for the free
travel of man and midlife.
Q

Will you tall me what the distance is from that

19
main highway to the development?
MR. SSINAs

This is from the State Highway to Mineral

King is approximately 25 miles.

The highway distance across

Sequoia National Park is approximately nine

miles.

Concerning

Mineral King itself, Agriculture would not have authority to allow
it, even if it were ordinary national forest land, which it?s not»
16 U» S. Code Section 497 permits the term use of only 80 acres of
that land for recreational purposes.

Hie Disney Development at

Mineral King is so large -that it spills over those 80 acres, and
it’s permanent facilities extend beyond team.
The Secretary of Agriculture's attempt to get around
497 by issuing a second permit for indispensable acreage violates
teat law,
16 U. 3, Code Section 551 is not authority for the
expanded term use* teat statute, as this Court found in United
States vs. Grimaud in 1911, delegates Congress power only over
administrative detail.

It is not the necessary express delegation

of power to transfer term interests in federal land.
Q

And yet it has been 'used rather widely, hasn't

it?
MR. SEIJMAs

Mr. Justice Blackrnun, it’s been used

widely for permits, which the government lias represented in every
case were terminable at will.

And those permits have been for

structures in many instances.

But in every instance the government

hte naid, Bvfe're in a position to take this use away immediately

20
and restore the public’s rig3.it in that land.'1
1:17.;;.. :."-<33ctiXr; difference, tlis difference bare is that the
term use is set for 30 years under the 80-acre permit, and
other uses are absolutely indispensable,. to the use that’s mads
on the 80 acres, and it results in a tying together of a use which
is one for permits for a period of 30 years for acreage exceeding 80.
The government correctly argues

—

Section 497

previously had a five-acre limitati.on, and that was amended in
1956*

The government correctly argues that the motivation of those

who wanted to expand five acres to 80 acres was to obtain certainty
of tenure and increase the national support for larger developments*
But tills explanation of what happened in .1956 is
inccvnplete.

Because it considers only the goals of tliose who

svcrht relief fraa the five-acre limit by disregarding the reason.'
for any acreage limitation at all.
Congress was concerned over the averse effects of
large developments on national forest Lands.

The Forest Service

•told Congress that 80 acres was necessary in order to include
all the facilities in modem developments, including ski lifts*
s

It calmed Congress’ fears by-saying that 80 acres was
■the maximum

limit.

This is set forth in cur Reply Brief at page

11, footnote 25v
Congress did not make the amendment which would have
been in order if certainty of tenure had been its only concern,
it didn’t just wipe out the five-acre limit?

21
instead it set a new limit of 80 acres.

In the entire history

of: this case, no one has explained the purpose of that limitation,
if not to restrict developments -bo SO acres.
New, when he was campaigning for relief from the fiveacre limitation, the Secretary of Agriculture did reveal that lie
liod used combined permits to get around the five-acre limit.

He

cjid not say that any of these combined permits exceeded 80 acres.
The key to this matter is that he was not seeking to have Congress
ratify his practice of combining permits, rather he was repre­
senting fcliafc if he could grant permits for up to 80 acres, the
practice would be discontinued.
'hie Ninth Circuit erroneously decided that the inter­
locking supplement permit to be used in this case need rot be
terminable at will.

Several Attorneys General, including Harlan

Fisks Stone, liave said otherwise.
The government admits at page 48 of its brief that
the supplemental permit is essential to the viability of the
project.

It is correct.

Revocation would destroy the $35 million

Disney investment, a major portion of which v/ill be within 80
acres,

the terrific impact on Mineral King of tills development

would make it impossible to restore it to its natural state.
Ihe supplemental permit is rot even technically

revocable.
Now, the government lias said that if the Court finds
that all of this is illegal, it will affect 84 existing ski resorts.

22.
Uiie fact of the matter is that it used not do that.
This is not a consistent administrative practice.

Satie regional

forces have used the practice ansi others have rejected it.

And,

in any event, there is no general department policy or regulation
on this subject.
Hiesa illegal acts don't legalize Mineral King, and.
they don't require tills Court to choose between closing teem down
and making Jlineral King legal.

'Hie Court may make the operation

of its order in this case perspective only.
Now, tbs Disney development as it stands on a national
forest, but it's doubly illegal because it was attempted to be
placed on a game refuge.
In li>26, wlon it created that game refuge, Congress
said tiiat its purpose was to protect fra?, trespass the public
lands of tlie refuge and the. game animals that may be

an

it.

"Which may be thereon" is tie language of the statute,
Hie impact of the Disney Development on the game's

ORAL Aim-SENT OF EKW3H N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.»
ON LEHftLF OF THE RESPQ®ENT
MR* GRISWOLD s

May it please the Courts

It is important, I think, to get the setting in this
case.

Mineral King is not a wilderness area, and has not been for

nearly 100 years.
Lack in the 1870's.

There was substantial mining activity there
The road in to Mineral King was built by the

County of Tulare in the 1880's and has been continuously maintained
since tint time.
That is the road ~ this is the main public highway in.
to Sequoia Park, and tills is the road which has existed since the
1880'sj for nearly 30 years, in to Mineral King.
In the early 1900's a hydroelectric facility was built
at Mineral King, which is still in use there.

There are many

cabins, 60 summer homes, two small resorts, a corroercial pack
station, and three public campgrounds located in Mineral King,
as the record shows at page 80.

24
There is indeed a great deal of wilderness area in
Sequoia National Park.

That is wall shown by the map vMdi is

near the end of the brief filed in this case by Tulare County,
which is essentially the sane area as the map on the board behind
rae.

But the enormous gray areas on that map are wilderness areas,

had been so designated by the President and recamended by him to
Congress for establishment as wilderness area.
The publicly occupied part of Sequoia Park is entirely
to the west, in here where the big trees are.
aver here is wilderness area.

MX of this area

Mount Whitney is here (indicating)

and that is full of pack trails and things like that, but is
wilderness area.
Mount Vfliitney is in the national park?
MR. GKESWOLDs

Mount Vihitney is an the border of the

park, about here (indicating), Mr. Justice.
Q

Yes.

I see.

MR. GRISWCED:
in preparing this case.

VO have been in something of a dilemma
It's been our best judgment that a

decision on tlie merits of the case would be in favor of the
respondents, and of course we would welcome such a decision.
Nevertheless, a decision on the merits could be
readied only after it was concluded that the petitioner liere had
adequate standing to .

ise the questions on the merits in the

District Court.
The question, of standing is important to the government,

25
and to the Court, too, I believe, for fids case, in a very real
sense, is the ultimate case on standing.

If the? petitioner here

has standing, then I believe it’s fair to conclude that any one
who asserts an interest in a controversy has standing.
In. our judgment, we would not meet our responsibility,
either to the government or to tlie Court, if we accepted such a
position without fully canvassing the problems involved.
The Sierra Club —
Q

As you know. General, I think the State of

Michigan enacted a lav; giving standing to any citizen in environmental controversies such as this.
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice, and

There is a bill before Congress doing the same

tiling.
MR. GRISWOLD s

There are bills pending before Congress.

We refer to them in our brief.
Q

Has it been reported out of

MR. GRISWOLD:
jjflporfcant.

They liave not been adopted.

That vould certainly be irrelevant and,

I*ra not sure that even Congress has the power to

create a case or controversy which is within the jurisdiction of
this Court.

Although it is certainly relevant and could press

the ’.ratter further than it would be wiiY.out the Act of Congress*
Certainly Congress can, in certain circumstances,
authorize what have been called by the Attorneys General.
The sierra Club is the only plaintiff here, in this

26
respect it is different

from

what, —- for example, in Overton Parle*

there were many other plaintiffs, and we didn't hare to question
the position of the Sierra Club.
In its cauplaint in the District Court* it did not
allege that it had any financial interest in the controversy.
It did not allege the ownership of any property involved or any
interference with any activities it: is conducting.

It did not

even allege a special interest in Mineral King.
The whole basis of their standing is in paragraph 3
of ihe c a-plaint * at the top? of page 4 of the Appendix, and it
is ~~ its sole allegation is that it lias a large niariber of members
and that it lias eadvlbited a special interest in the conservation
and sound maintenance of the national parks* game refuges and
forests of the country.

And that vmid include Mew Ilanpsliire

and Maine as well as California.

With particular reference to

tie national resources of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
And that, is the ooaplete allegation in the canplaint*
page 4* paragraph 3,

yellow.

I have that one,

MR. GRISWQLDs

And the red one, I believe, leave to

file was granted by consent of both sides.
But the Wilderness Society says that the Sierra Club
really lias more specific grounds of standing, and in its Reply
Brief and in the oral argument here, the Club now adepts the
position of the Wilderness Society*

But there are no allegations

in the ccmplaint to warrant such a decision.
The complaint was based solely on the baldest grounds
of

-c:

r-i iy of ini tost.

It's not inappropriate to conclude, I

28
think* that the Sierra Club took, this position for two reasons,
and one «*«•» the first of these reasons is now disclosed in — on
page 6 of their Reply Brief* where they says

“The government seeks

to create a 'heads 1 win* tails you lose' situation in. which either
the . courthouse door is barred for lade of assertion of a private*
unique injury car a preliminary injunction is denied on the ground
that the litigant has advanced private injury which does not
warrant an injunction adverse to a carpeting public interest.
Counsel have shaped their case to avoid this trap -13
Khat they say is that if they had a real plaintiff
here* he couldn't have shown irreparable harm because whatever
damage he suffered would be met by the government»

They could

not* on that basis* have got a preliminary injunction.

So they

had to appear in the most general terras in order to get a
preliminary injunction* which they got.
And then, the second ground of their proceeding as
-j-hyy have* I think* is that in the hope that there would be a
decision on the merits* and that such a decision would thereby
establish the proposition that the Sierra Club and numerous
other worthy organizations * old and. new* have standing to raise
in court any legal question in which they assert an interest and
without more*
If such a result is reached* I believe that any
individual* whether he be citizen or alien* and in the Amchitka
cav e we had a Canadian club of a few hundred members as a party*

29
would have standing to raise any question in court in which he
assarts he has an interest without «ore*

I

don't think there's any magic in the fact -chat the

Sierra Club is a club* or that has members, ca: a long and
distinguished history, many of which members may wall share the
interest which its rtanagsment new advances.

If it is the fact

that it is a group that gives it standing, tew big a group must it
be?

Three members or five or fifty?

Or fifty thousand?

VIhat reason is there for picking any number?

If any

group has standing because it has an intellectual or ©notional
interest, does it not inevitably follow that any individual who
asserts an interest likewise has standing to raise these legal
questions?
If the Sierra Club has standing, as Mr, Justice
Blackman suggested, would not John Muir have standing?
If the Sierra Club has standing, why does it not
follow that John Gardner, and my estimable former student Ralph
fteder liteidra have standing to raise in court any questions of
law which appeal to them as being in the public interest?
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, in the United Church case,

which was not treated in this Court but only in the Court of
Appeals, the standing was rested on the idea that television and
radio broadcasters reach into the private hopes of every, virtually
every lit barer every day.
standing.

hnd on that ground listeners were given

Would you quarrel with that kind of a concept?

30
MR. GRISl^OIsDs

No, Mr, Justice, although I think it is

very close to the line, bat I think it’s on the proper side of the
line.

that’s a little complicated because it arose out of an

administrative proceeding and, as I understand it, the United Church
was a party in tlie administrative proceeding, and thus might well
be a

aggrieved under the statute authorized by Congress,
here there has been no administrative proceeding, and

the Sierra Club claims no standing as a party.
I can accept the United Chinrch^of Christ case, perhaps,
because I happen to like the outcome.

But I think it is very

close to the line, and not quite the same as this one.
If the Sierra Club has standing, why would rot the
Wilderness Society and the other amici likewise have standing?
There’s no reason ~~

Q

By the wav, did any of then seek to intervene?

MR. GRISWCIDs

No, Mr. Justice.

There! s no reason that X can see why such cases would,
have to be brought in the Northern District of California.

The

suits are against government offi.ce.rs, and they can now be served
anywhere in the United States.

Theoretically ws could have a

thousand suits brought by interested individuals and organisations
in tiie S3 Judicial Districts of the United States, with resulting
vast confusion.

This could probably perhaps be helped by

transfers and special procedures for multi-district litigation,
bafc it would be complex at best.

in court any legal issue which he is moved to raise? At least,
if he is moved enough to litigate about it, do we not have, as
this case shews, -the vigorous thrust of the adversary systaa, so
that this Court and the lower courts will be. fully informed on
the issues involved? Was that bridge not crossed in Baker vs.

in Article III of the Constitution*
Analytically one could have a system of government in
which every legal question, arising in. the core of government would

More important* it is not the system which was
ordained and established in our Constitution* as it. lias been

cape that I thought it worthy of bringing to ‘this Court. .

The

position there is that the plaintiff can maintain, that suit as a

but they bring it on behalf of other citizens who might be
intimidated if they didn’t stand up and talk for them.

a brief in which they said that oemmon cause intends to litigate

it. is much interested in the questions of standing involved in
that case.
If there is standing in this case# I find it very
difficult to think of any legal issue arising in government

In

The issue here, in that respect, is a basic and

fundamental one.

It is the appropriate limit on the judicial

function under our constitutional system..
Should judges be dealing almost continuously with
heated social, and economic controversies?

Will not the courts

be in a better position to decide the many difficult and Important
questions which only the courts can effectively resolve in our
constitutional system if they do not undertake to decide all

game refuges and -the function of that is that hunting is not
allowed in a national game refugs # although it is allowed in a
national park.
There is nothing about making it a national game
refuge which means that it must be kept a wilderness or that
people may rot use the park freely.
As long ago as 1949, the Secretary of Agriculture
designated the area as a recreation area "hereby set apart and
reserved for public recreation vise”.
And in 1960 Congress enacted the multiple-use
sustained-yield Act which provides for recreation use.
There are two statutes# one of which now authorizes
term permits for 80 years# the other of which authorizes
term permits for 80 acres up to 30 years; the other of which
authorizes revocable permits without limitation of area, but
always revocable.
And the legislative history makes it perfectly
plain that when Congress extended the term permit area from
five, acres to 80 acres in 1956, both committees in both houses
of Congress recorded in the ocamittee reports -that the
Department of Agriculture now has adequate authority to issue
revocable permits for all purposes under the Act of June 4,
.

39

1897»
I do not see that there is any basis for saying that
there cannot be both term permits and revocable permits, arid,

as the Appendix in our brief shows, there are 84 situations
'where that has been done over a period of many years, and both
the practical construction and the fact, that this has been
repeatedly called to the attention of Congress leads to that
conclusion*
Now, with respect to the highway through the park,
that beoones the Interior Department rather than Agriculture
Department.

16 U.S.C. 8 expressly provides that the Secretary

of the Interior shall have power ”to construct, reconstruct,
and

improve roads in the national parks.”
This is either a construction of a new road or a

recxaistruction.

It is in part on the sane right-of-way and in

part elsewhere.

There is nothing in the statute which says

that the road must be for park purposes.
road does have a legitimate park use.

More important, I an advised that it will

Perhaps the superficially most difficult problem in

the case is the provision with respect to the electric line.
This is a 66f00G~^/o3.t transmission line which, however, is to
be buried in the road* no lines and no cables, arid we do have a
statute, Section 45(c), which says that no permanent license,
lease, and so forth, for conduits, reservoirs, dams, powerhouses,
transmission lines, or other work for storage or carriage of
water shall be granted or trade without specific authority from
Congress,
And if that statute is read alone, if becomes very
difficult to deal with*
However, the legislative history shows very plainly
that this language first appeared in the Federal Power Act and
was intended to prvsnt the Federal Power Cemmission from granting
licenses to build hydroelectric establishments, dams, water power
and transmission lines in national parks,

This was dona an 1921,

has ran pack trips in 'Mineral King, and it’s also true that
that specific indicator of its interests in the area was not
part of the allegations of the complaint.
Tho.se pack trips are a non-profit activity.
are not for any private purpose.

They

Their purpose is to acquaint

people with the natural features of the area, so that they in
turn will he workers to help to preserve it.
My interference which the Disney plan would have
with those pack trips would not haw teen of sufficient impor­
tance

-bo this Club to undertake the litigation that has ensued

fcsj.e., hr'. bee: vro i'v.;a r-.-cf-- trips# though they are non-profit#
and though they are in fur’cherance of its interest in the area?
could have been n&suaisrstood as an ©canonically oriented or other
privat- i interests not directly related to the public interest# they
ware not alleged„
Mov# concerning vhether the courts will be . inundated
by the granting cf standing in a case such as this# I should only
say that the experience which many# many cases have. alluded to his
been not that the courts have been inundated at all# but that the
number of lawsuits brought by environmsnta?i.sts and consex'v’p.tion
greets has been significantly limited by the practicalities and
•liie realities of carrying out litigation of tills type.
Mow# oDncemisg injury# it’s true that injury to
aesthetic causerva-tional and recreational values is different
in kind than an injury iso a voter11 s rights cr an injury to a
fcaspayar’s rights# it's nevertheless a concrete injury# and it
should serve every bit as strongly as this Court has already
noted in the Data Prccassing ca.se as a basis for statutory
agreement

aggrievement under the Administrative Procedure

Act: as those other types of injury.
