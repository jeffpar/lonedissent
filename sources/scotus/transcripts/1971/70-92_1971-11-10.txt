CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

We will hear arguments

Trucking Unlimited,
Mr, Lakusta# you may proceed whenever you're ready
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BORIS H, LAKUSTA, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF .THE PETITIONERS
MR* LAKUSTA:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court s
The issue in this proceeding in whether the facts
in a treble damage antitrust complaint constitute a violation
under the Shaman Act,

In this case, a group of 15 certificated

motor carriers brought the complaint against a group of 19
certificated motor carriers, alleging that the defendants had
violated the Sherman Act,

The complaint was amended, and the

first amended complaint is the one with which we are concerned,
I shall refer to it simply as "the complaint.”
, They moved to dismiss it on the ground that it
fails to state a cause of action under the Sherman Act.
Judge Sweigert of the Federal District Court agreed with our
position and wrote an extensive opinion in support of his views.
He gave the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend.

They did not

avail.themselves of that, and instead appealed to the
Circuit.»

The Ninth Circuit reversed bv a two to one vote .

The dissenting judge, Senior Judge Hamlin wrote a dissenting

4
opinion,
We then petitioned for a. writ of certiorari to
this Court o
How X turn to the complaint, and X will summarise
the. facts which it alleges»
It alleges that these defending carriers got.
together in early 1961 and agreed on a program of protesting
all certificate proceedings which might result in competition
to the defendants , all certificate proceedings brought before
either the Interstate Commerce Commission or the California
Public Utilities Commission.

Tho program was to include court

review in the event the protest before the administrative
foody should prove unsuccessful.
The allegation is that the defendants agreed to
finance the program jointly under an arrangement under which
each carrier would contribute monthly a sum based on his gross
annual revenues, rather than according to his interest or
participation in any given case.
The agreement was that the program should be pub­
licised through the carrier industry.

The complaint goes

on to allege, the agreement was carried out and has been
carried out consistently since 1961»

As to the purpose, the

allegation is that the agreement and program were designed
to reduce or eliminate competition, and that to achieve that
anticompetitive result, the complaint alleges if we accept

plaintiffs’version, as I think we must? for the purposes
of this case, that defendants* primary intent was, to use
the words of the complaint, to discourage and deter the plain
tiffs and others in like position -from filing certificate
applications or from pursuing those applications, which they
did file.
In this connection, the plaintiffs say that the
defendant carriers intended to make as effective a presenta­
tion in each case before the relevant commission' as possible;
in fact, they recognized that such an intent was essential
to the primary purpose of giving authority to the desire to
discourage or deter plaintiffs and others in like position
from coming before the Commission.
There is no suggestion in the complaint that the
defendants were at any time guilty of dishonesty or deception
There is no suggestion in the complaint that the defendants
at any time offered false or irrelevant testimony,
I would like to turn now to the reasons why we
believe the Sherman Act should not he extended to the facts
as alleged.

The two cases on which we chiefly rely are

Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr, decided in
1961 by this Court.

It was a unanimous decision, and Justice

Black wrote the decision.

The other cs.se is United. Mine
».»

usnrtnMrv«.i>tHiin

Workers versus Pennington decided four years later in 1965.
Mr. Justice White wrote the opinion for the mngox'ifcy in that

6

ease*
We start with a proposition in Ncerr that a
restraint imposed by government is immune from the antitrust
act.

That has been held in Parker v. Brown and in U.S. v,

It would seam to follow reasonably that the

efforts to influence government to impose such go var nmen. ta 1
restraint should also be immune from the Sherman Act.
think that is, at least in broad terms* the holding in Hoerr
and Pennington.
The joint efforts involved in Kfoerr

were efforts

to influence at least one state governor and more than one
state legislature, and also certain law enforcement agencies.
The joint effort in Pennington involves joint efforts to influ­
ence the Secretary of Labor and officials of the Tennessee
Valley Authority.
The Nosrr case sets forth three reasons for holding
that the Sherman Act should not apply to these joint efforts.
The first reason was essential dissimilarity; in
other wards, that appeals to governmental bodies are essen­
tially . dissimilar from the kind of trade-? restraint which
Congress had in mind when it enacted the Sherman Act.
The second reason given in Nosrr was that there is
indeed a strong policy of government to encourage the
free flow of information to government officials charged
with adopting or imposing restrictive action»

7
The third reason given was that if the Sherman Act
were extended to apply in these joint efforts, it would raise
serious questions of whether the First Amendment right to
petition would he jeopardised.
The second reason deserves our particular attentions
namely, the strong policy of government to encourage the- free
flow of information to governmental offices charged with
action which may have a restrictive effect.

The concept is

that in such an area, the government can do its job best
in this very discretionary sphere if it can call upon the
information of members of the public who have an interest,
As noted in Koerr,

it is those with competitive interest

who can be best counted on? they are the most motivated to
furnish the very kind of information which will he of assist­
ance to the government,

I suppose it is paradoxical that

that should be true, but it is true that those with an anti­
competitive motive can often be most useful in assisting the
governmental body make its determination»
Mr, Khourie, counsel for the Plaintiffs, recognizes
that, reason in the Noerr case, but he says the doctrine
should apply only to legislative and executive activity, and
in any ©vent, not to applications for certificates of public
convenience and necessity, the general certificating process
engaged in by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Pub­
lic Utilities Commission.

He goes to great efforts to say

that their activities? are judicial

hure and he

to the fact that certainly the procedures of those bodies
have many of the overtones of proceedings before a court;
the calling of witnesses, the swearing of witnesses, the
receipt of evidence which is not hearsay, and so on.
Then he tarns to say that what these bodies do is to adjudica
in the realm of certification.

He then turns to the patent

eases which he relies ora very heavily for the proposition
that efforts to obtain a restraint of the use of judicial
machinery may be actionable under the Sherman Act.

X submit

that the patent cases which involved the grant of an absolute
monopoly have little relevance to the case we have here, and
that all of them can be readily explained to the extent they
do present any conflict with the Noarr~Pennincrton doctrine.
Well, X submit that it is immaterial whether the
•action of the Public Utilities Commission and Interstate
Commerce Commission ..be described as adjudication or adjudicatory or by any other name.

The pertinent question is whether

the agency is Substantially aided by the kind of information
which competitive interests can be'expected to produce,
they are protected by the Sherman Act.

if

I submit that the

answer is yes, vis-a-vis the ICC and the puc.
So to substantiate that, 1 point out. what the
certificate regulating function is.

Senior Judge Hamlin,

the same judge in the Ninth Circuit, correctly characterised

9
as

0*1 e akin to policy making•"

The concept of public

convenience and necessity commands a very broad discretion.
This Courc has .copesteci3.y said sc.

The content can varv a

great uS3j, according to time and cix'cumstancss.

I would

suggest that in practical effect, there is very littledifference between what I might describe as the public
interest standards which a legislature or a governor employs
when he ;tak<ts action of a restrictive nature,, and the
public convenience and. necessity standard, which an agency
such as ICC or PUC applies»

The agency, contrary to what Mr,

Knourie would say, does not adjudicate rights? there is
no such thing as a right by Carrier A to a certificate.

On the contrary, the agency is regulating in the public
interest, and the grant or denial of a certificate is simply
an incident *co that overall regulation of one segment of the
public utility industry.
Now, with such understanding of the certificating
function, it is perhaps no surprise that ..protests from exist­
ing-carriers are sanctioned and encouraged.

The Interstate

uoremerc© Acc and the Public Utilities Cod® both"contain pro­
visions which indicate an anticipation that the protests
it, p&i.ticip&tjuon of competitors in the form of those already
holding certificates shall be entertained,
Then very specifically the procedures of the two
agencies provide tor the intervention of competitors.

Every

10
compatitor is, so far as the California Commission goes at
least, required to, entitled to receive notice of the applica­
ticn, if the application is tor certification in his area,
and such carrier is entitled to come in and protest and say
his piece»
Indeed, it is customary before both the ICC and the
PUC for groups of carriers to come in and protest as the
defendants are alleged to have done here.

The only difference

that I can see is that in this ease, the program was' a
concerted program to participate in all proceedings that
come along, rather than sporadically.
To comment on the concept of probable cause, the
complaint alleges that protests were filed in all cases, and
it goes on in the same vein to say, "with or without probable
cause and regardless of the merits."

1 suggest, your Honors,

that the concept of probable causes simply has no place in a
proceeding which involves the issue of public convenience and
necessity. It is not the adjudication of a private right.
Probable cause is a concept which applies, for instance, in a
suit on a contract involving the payment of money and most
of the time if cam be determined very quickly whether the
complaint, is frivolous or whether there is probable cause.
Q

Mr. Lakusta, we are, 1 take it,— you are approaching

this case on the assumption that the allegations in the
complaint are true?

MR. LAKUSTA:
Q

We must

ycur Honor , yes.

So we take this to mean in advance the defendants

agreed to oppose every petition of the kind listed in the
complaint?
MR, LAKUSTAs
G

Without ever having seen it,

Yes, and I take it you think they did regardless

of what it said.
MR. LAKUSTA:
Q

We accept that allegation.

If they had agreed

to bribe one of the Commissioners

in order to monopolise commerce, would you 'have a different
outlook?
MR. LAXUSTAsicertainly wou1d,
Q

Well, X know they’d be guilty of bribery, but would

they be guilty of a Sherman Act violation, if they got it
by subverting the adjudicatory process for the purpose of
achieving a monopoly?
MR. LAKUSTA.;
0

I should think they well might be,

Then you accept the Wood case?
MR. LAKUSTA: 1 accept the Wood case,
"«v. -~ec- *

Q

Where they agreed to file falsa information?
MR. LAKUSTAs

Yes, assuming that the facts are as

they were found by the Court of Appeals ir. that ease, then X
accept the Wood case,

I say that in a proceeding before the

Interstate Commerce Commission or the Public ut. lities Com­
mission, which has its own procedures and which is designed

12
tio get at facts ? the presentation of false .information should
very well come in a different category.

Presentation of facts

which arc relevant and bear on that overall concept of
what is in the public interest, on which any two people can
differ*—*
Q

How many defendants are there?
MR. LAKUSTA:

Q

Nineteen?

There are nineteen.

They don’t all operate in the same area,

I take it?
MR. LAKUSTA:
Q

No, to some extent they do, but

Would you say every single defendant whoda named

would really have a substantial interest in every single
petition any time that was over filed before the PUC or the
ICC?
MR. LAKOSTA: Well,- you will observe, your Honor,
that the complaint alleges the protests were* filed in every
case where there was a competitive interest, not in every
conceivable case.
Q

1 know, but what interest would A operating in

Southern California have in agreeing with B in Northern
California, for B helping him to oppose and jointly finance
the opposition before the PUC tc a transfer of some operating
right in Southern California?
What interest does the Northern California man have
in contributing?

13
MR. LAKUSTA?

Well. I think 1 understand your

question, Justice White, and the answer lies in the fact
that what the Commission does is to regulate a whole industry

unix it is very much in the interest and was very much in the
interest of these defendants to make an effort to persuade
the Commission to apply a more restrictive policyy so that
in every case since the Commission does determine policy on a
case by case basis,, it means that every case that cases along
dees involve an issue of the overall policy of the extent
to which certification would be in the public intereat.

Q

But it is hard to conceive, if there were 500

petitions filed, that there wouldn’t he a single on© of them
that was meritorious? that every one of them deserved joint
opposition.
MR. LAKUSTft:

Well, X think we have to bear in

mind that the opposition was only to the extent and as
permitted by the regulatory agency-™
Q

X understand.
MR. LAKUST&:*—If there is no allegation of abuse

of the administrative process, so 1 would say that the
interest of every carrier who participated in this program
arises from the fact that he has an interest in the overall
way in which the Commission formulates its continuing policy
in determining the scope and content to be given.
0

In this respect, is it basically fundamentally any

different from collective enterprises by working men or
collective enterprises of trade associations?

This is in

effect a trade association,
MR. LAKUSTA% Yes, it is* Mr. Chief Justice.
0

It is a trade association of the in’s against, the

out * s „
MR. LAKUSTAs

It is not altogether the in’s against

the out’s because it is certificated carriers.
0

Rut it is cast in this case.
MR. LAKUSTA;

Yes# it is# Mr. Chief Justice# out

I think basically it’s what trade associations do when they
group together to produce a joint result,,

I believe that

so long as the evidence offered by these protestants is
honest and relevant* and they are helping the agency to
formulate the policy# their activity should not he allowed
to fall under the Sherman Act.
Q

Don’t you have to argue to make your case that

the First Amendment right which underlies the case includes
the right to act in bad faith?

And for improper 'motives?

To find under the Sherman Act?
MR* LAKUSTA; Well# it includes the right to act
for that kind of motive, yes, provided the intent, the one
intent# namely to influence the governmental body it genuine,,
Now* in the Noerr case# all sorts of devious means were used
Mne»ruiMB*«iviUpin

to influence the legislature and governor.

That kind on thing

would not be allowed in an administrative bddy sueh as the
ICC or PUG,

I would say that in that category# it has to be

shown that the intent was to foe as effective as possible with
honest evidence and relevant evidence# in order to corae within
the purview of the Noerr doctrine,
•naewMsawa

Q

And also isn't that the base of the matter# the

question of whether the PUC # if it in taking the action can—
well# I'll put it this ways

How can the stats PUC body do that under

Yes# you have the Parker case holding#

Q

They can't authorise private individuals to viol-,

MR, LAKUSTA:
Q

No.

But it can take action that isn’t reached by the

antitrust laws?
MR, LAKUSTA:
that the action:

That is quite:true.

Now# I suggest

in this case, any restraint in this case

is fundamentally imposed because the final result of what
the Commission does# based upon evidence in granting or deny­
ing certificates# as to the value of participation by the
defendants# the complaint makes the markedly revealing allega­
tion that there were instances in which certificates were

io

denied only because the defendants and only because the
defendants were present,

X think Judge Sweigert put his fingar

on it when he said that if yon don’t have protests* these
applications otherwise become one-sided affairs, the Com­
mission is rendered more or less helplessf it does not have
the manpower to go out and make all the .investigatione 'which
the defendants are motivated to com in and give evidence
oily and unless you permit them to come in, the Commission is

in the very unhappy position of having to give certificates
based only on what they see in the application»
Q

So we don’t have in this case an instance where

there is joint effort to persuade a governmental body or
®o administrative body to do something it. dees not have power
to 6c?
M9, I-.&KU5T&: No, there’s no allegation of that kind.
I think that is the fatal weakness, in this complaint.
There is r,o allegation that the administrative body ever lacked
complete power to control their processes- that prevent abuses
in the form of redundancy or excessive protest*

There's no

allegation that the agencies lack power to make determinations
upon the merits.
Q

X see in the comment in the California Law Review

in this case; that what this amounts to is the defendants--!
am reading just one sentence here—that the defendants
substituted themselves for the Public Utilities Commission,

and regulated for their own profit. the registration of
certificates—is that correct?
MR» L&KUSTA:

Well, I don’t think that it is correct

unless you—
Q

It was fortified by the decline in applications.
MR» LAKUSTA*

Yes, well, the decline ir applications

is most significant because it shows that the agency was—
first of all, that there was an effect of discouraging and
deterring those from coming before the agency v?ho did not ~~
who were not willing to stand the chance of making a presenta­
tion.

I submit, your Honor, that the real cruse of the matter

is that a person who comes in and presents an application
to the Commission should expect to have to undergo the burden
of having to prove up»

Wow the effect of the program of the

defendants was to keep out those who did not have the
responsibility or the sense of responsibility to be willing
to prove up? what they wanted, in a sense, was a free ride»
They wanted to take advantage of the situation that had
obtained before, when the Commission had nothing to go on
but the application, and therefore was granting certificates
sacre or less freely, and. X think —
Q

Did your organisation intervene in those PUC cases?
MR. LAKUSTA;? It did, yes,.

Q

7 mean prior to the time you were doing the things

you are charged with doing here?

15

HR. LAKUSTA?

Iof prior to the fine of the activity

alleged here? there were virtually no protects.

In fact#

X think that's alleged in the complaint# certainly in the
Plaintiffs brief? there were virtually no protests and the
Commission was granting certificates, as they say# under a
liberal., policy •

The Commission does not have any liberal

policy as such# on the books?- contrary to what Hr. Khourie
says# there was indeed a grace period to cleanup a bad
situation# but after that# the policy mis public convenience
and necessity# and during the period until the defendants
came# the certificates were-granted very freely, not baeacre
of any liberal policy but because of the absence of the kind
of counter-evidence which is very useful to the governmental
body in making its determinations.
Q

Are there allegations of conduct on the part of your

clients to discourage applicants ever

going after certificates

and threatening them if they did, they .would be involved
with the kind of resistance which would make it very# very
expensive?
MR. LAKUSTas
Q

But aren’t there allegations of that?
MR. LAKUSTA2

Q

Well# if X read 'the factual context'

Yes.

Is that within the defense you are making?
MR.LAKUSTA; Well,

the allegation is that the way

in which that threat occurs was# say# to publicise. c,We will

go and we will protest,” so X say any discouragement ore deter­
rence is a result of governmental action.
Q

Do you think that is within —
MR.LMUST&s Yes, 2 think it is because unless this

kind of activity is protected, it means the agency is deprived
of the kind of information--*
Q

1 thought this was conduct, as I understood the

allegations, to discourage applicants from ever going to these,
by threatening him if he did he was going to be met with the
kind of resistance which would make the proceeding a very, very
expensive one for him?
MR, LAKOSTAs Wall, there's nothing wrong in imposing
upon an applicant the requirement that he make out his case.
Certainly he has no right to receive a certificate without
proving up his case, and 1 think that that is what justifies
whatever discouragement or deterrence may have arisen in the
program,

Q

Certainly the fact situation (inaudible) to include

that aspect,
MR, LMUSTAx No, it is quite true it is different
in that respect,
Q

There is much more here than merely your practice

of intervening in the cases.
MR, LftKUSTAs 2 didn't understand, your Honor.
Q

As Justice Brennan points out, there's much more

20
than merely intervening in these PuC proceedings?
MR. LAKUSTA2

Mo, on -the contrary, your Honor,

the factual allegations,Mr* Justice Brennan has referred to
conclusions, but the factual allegations fco support, it are
simply that the defendants publicized this program and said
if you come in? we shall protest.

Now, the expense can always

be controlled by the agency'itself; there’s no problem of
an inability on the part of the plaintiffs to complain to the
Commission and say that this proceeding is becoming too bur­
densome, the evidence is being repetitious. I've seen many
a case where such allegation has been made, and the proceeding
has been carefully restricted, and there's no allegation here
that the defendants or that the agencies in question were
rendered powerless to control any abuses„

Q

Are you suggesting that this is essentially the same

as though a newspaper carried a box on the. front page saying
if anyone sues us for libel by virtue of what we say, we’ll
keep them in litigation for years, and it will not be profitable
to sue us for libel?

Something of that kind?

Are you

suggesting this First Amendment right is the same as this
hypothetical X am giving you?
MR. LAKtJSA:
far.

if they say,

Ho, your hypothetical goes a little bit

'If you sue us for libel, we’ll fight you

and fight you hard all the way, " then X would say that is
perhaps what we have hare.

21
Q

And you say that is what your clients are doing?
MR. LAKUSTA: That is the allegation.

Q

Tae allegation as distinguished from the conclusions

and inferences drawn from those allegations?
MR. LAKUSTA* Yes, 1 think it's true to say that the
allegation is that the defendants would protest in every
casef but always with that caveat that the protest would be
within the realms of the administrative processes and would
not. transgress those processes, and that the protest would be
for the purpose of offering honest evidence and never falsify­
ing o

x say that that caveat is there because there is no

allegation in the complaint to the contrary.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER2

Very well, you have

consumed your entire time, Mr. Lakusta.

Mr. Khourie.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL N. KHOURIE, ESQ„
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KHOURIE:

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, may it please the Court:
1 think from Mr. Lakusta*s remarks about the content
of the complaint, it certainly emphasizes in say mind that, a
trial is needed in this case to determine what this plan
embraced? whether it embraced as you posited this ad in the
paper saying, "We'll sue anyone," or whether it said in
effect, "If you sue us, we'll defend on good grounds,"

because although we admit in our complaint, in our brief
•chat no lies were told, because we ■■don't know of any,
we do not' say that relevant information was given in all
protests because many of too protests were made witHeut--any
cause at all.

We have alleged, this agreement was made in

advance at one point, the Coronado Hotel in 1961, ir. San
Diego, which said that we world protest each and every applica­
tion, irrespective of what it is, where its location is,
which is hereafter filed by any applicant.
Now I would ' like in a moment, if X may, to review
what X believe the allegations clearly say, but X think it
is important that at least 7. communicate to this Court what
the charge is here, that there’s an abuse of processes by
which government receives information by these defendants
for anticompetitive? purposes.
Now, the processes in this case are the processes
which follow, happens to be the way it was set up, for
certification? the processes are in the judicial model.
We have filled our appendix perhaps over-full with regula­
tory processes and rules which show that it is in the judicial
model, and of course this is the way the California and the
United States Congress and legislature has
tion.

set np certifica­

This is done because these"'are

cases based upon, as Judge Browning said in the Ninth Circuit,
standards of more or less generality, but they still are

23
individually decided -jases which «such more arc in the— ■
not in the political rough-and-tumble which I believe is all
Nperr dealt with# and all Noerr meant to deal with.
Nov the processes I am speaking ox are not govern­
ment action.

They are self-actuating.

In other words, just

like all court processes, ycu file a protest and things start
happening without any government official making any kind
of decision, and those things are things which cause delay
and expense, and it is knowledge of these things and their
impact on competitors which the defendants relied upon to
harass and make expensive any protests.
New when a notice of appeal is filed, that

gats

things in motion, and no government official or authority has
made any kind of decision, so —
G

Isn’t every adjudicatory body possessed of inherent

powers to deal with what we might call abuses of its process?
MR,, KHOURXE3

It certainly is, Mr, Chief Justice

Burger,
Q

Isn’t that the factor that backstops this situation?
MR, KHOURXE: It is. It’s the—

Q

Why isn’t that enough, then, without the Sherman

Act?
MR. KHOURXE s

Because the abuse of the judicial.

process was designed to restrain competition.

Now*, I don’t

think the law is that if there is another remedy, that the

Sherman Act is thereby ousted of jur isdiction* I believe that
unless there’s a specific exemption in legislations, as in
some of the Interstate Commerce Comission Acts,. exemptions,
the Rebul-Winkle {phonetic) exception9 et cetera, or unless
there is an implied immunity. as there was in the Pan American
case,, where there is a collision between the regulatory
scheme and the antitrust laws, or unless there is a Parker
against Brown type of immunity, which is s judge-created
immunity which holds the Sherman Act not to apply to valid
state action, or unless there’s the kind of immunity given
in Hoerr-Pennington, I do believe sincerely there is no
immunity for tortfeasors who commit other torts, and as
against whom a competitor may have a tort action that that
tortfeasor is thereby entitled to immunity from the Sherman
Act.

I believe the Sherman Act is a law of general applica­

tion, and you can violate it by lawful means and unlawful
means.

The mere fact, for example, that slander is perhaps

a remedy which is available, perhaps the Pul'?lie Utilities
Commission, although I don’t think is within their______
to remedy this situation, because they’d have to have a
hearing on standing first to see if there is probable cause
for this person to be there.
But to answer your question, us X see it, I don't
believe the mere fact that the regulatory body, may have and
prospectively, X might 3ay, the right to remedy this situation,

can be used to deny these defendants the right to certain
damages, if they’ve been found to be damaged, and 1' don't
think it ousts the federal courts of jurisdiction » 1 don’t
think that was the Congressional intent *
1 think these rules, these rules which are actuated
byprivate citizens, because in hoary you had two things in
Hoerr s

you had genuine attempts to influence government for

the purpose of restraining trade, and that’s what was pro­
tected.

Here there are no genuine attempts, in our view»

The plan can not foe segmented between those applications which
are protested, in which there is probable cause, and those
applications which are protested, in which there are none.
What the defendants3 plan embraced was to protest everything
and to appeal everything and take everything to the highest
level without exception, and the thing that separates the
plan from Hoary, I think, is that they knew that these
government processes they were using would act directly upon
the applicants, and they also didn’t let the Public Utilities
Commission know of their plan, nor the public, nor others?
they let their competitors know.

They let their competitors

know that as we say, they would appeal all the way.

The

plan we «ay was a plan which was devised solely to .deter the
filing of applications. It wasn’t devised for any other
reason, and Mr. Lakusta is incorrect in saying that we allege
the plan was to provi.de information to government in every

#

and. believe we can prove that the plan was to deter other
people ...from informing government and from coming before
government, and to intensify the

and here again we

admit there is a burden to litigation# there’s a burden to
meeting the legitimate protests of your competitor, but the
plan here was to intensify it to such a degree to let
competitors know the wealth and the determination and the
binding agreement that these 20 or so carriers had to take
every protest and to protest it to the degree that they did.
This was made known immediately after the 1951 meeting.
Q

Does a protest automatically entitle the protester

to intervention?
MR. KHOURIE: To a hearing, yes, it does.
Q

That is true of the ICC and is also true of the PUC?
Mr. KHOURIE:

That’s correct.

It entitles him also under the rules, to rehearing,
entitles him to bring it before the full Commission, entitles
him to go into the court system, entitles

him to appeal to

the highest courts, and that was ©"feature of the plan.
what they said they were going to 'do.

That’

It was in effect a use

of the processas to terrorise, X believe, the competitors, the
smaller competitors by use of this gigantic force.
Q

Do you conceive it to be part of the burden if you

go to trial, to prove that there were prospective applicants

who did not apply because of this?
MR. KHOURISt If we desire, Mr. Justice Brennan*
to obtain damages for them, wo will have to prove under the
applicable rules of damages that they did not apply.
0

You ask for an injunction*, too?
MR. KBOUEIEs

Q

Yes.

lit least you want that?
MR. KKOURIEs

Yeo, we want an, injunction„ --

• '.r,, wo

do, because we. believe that the policy of the PUC has not
changed.

The policy is still a liberal policy.

That is why

we say they have subverted the policies of the PUC.

They

have dons it by employing mechanisms which merely are
expensive irin coping.
Mow the point is made that they made the bast case
possible in every case.

Obviously the?/- did, because we

believe that part of their plan*—and the plan could not have
been effective unless they went before the Commission with
competent counsel.1,, which they did—they made every argument
conceivable which they did, and I submit that even if there
is no probable cause whatsoever to opposition, that

counsel

can always think of arguments, always arguments but the basic
purpose was there, and the result on the policy basis was
that information stopped flowing to government.
In 1961, if you can take that breadth of hands, there
was this many applications, and there was the right to protest,

28
and the

information was flowing to government.

In

1952 there

were that many applications, and information to that extent
was flowing to government.

In 1964 and 55, there were this

many applications, and to that extent information to government
was being curtailed.

It got to the point where no information

was flowing to government.
«

0

Yon mean it was so effective that no applications

were filed?
MR. KHOORIE:

Extremely few.

C can tell you that

we can prove, in my opinion, that applications went from a
level of pure competition, because,. the policy of the Public
Utilities Commission

was that’they were going to grant

virtually every application upon a showing of fitness.

They

had adopted and in our brief

Public

we cite opinions

of the

Utilities Commission, whereby they have adopted a policy of
open competition»
Q

They have never changed that policy?
MR. KHOURIE:

changed that policy.

We do not believe that they’have
We believe that applications have dried

up, and we believe that we can prove that applications have
dried up.
Q

We can prove that applications have dried up.

Are there any allegations in the complaint that the

defendants agreed to agree upon what transactions not to
oppose?

Let's assume there was a merger proposed betweein one

of the defendants and some smaller carrier or something, did

J-»

ii 'J*

they agree among themselves not to oppose certain transactions
or you just don’t allege that?
MR. KHOURXE:

We allege, Mr. Justice White, that

they agreed to oppose applications for certificates, applications'
to transfer certificates, and applications to register
certificates

with the Interstate Commerce Comission, and

they agreed to oppose all of their applications and as far as
we knew, they didn’t agree to do anything else,
Q

All right.

2 suppose good arguments could be made,

if you advance to trial in this case, on the part of your
opponents, that it is not in the public interest, to grant all
applications and have this enormous number of people holding
certificates, arguments emphasising that?
HR. KHOURXEs
Q

Well, they could.

To that extent, further argument could he made that

they serve 'public interest by keeping the operations confined
to strong carriers.
MR. KHOURXE:

Well, any monopolist X suppose could

take that position and perhaps they sincerely feel that that"
is the correct position.
Almost the history of the railroads in the United
States, isn’t it?
MR. KHOURXEs

That is correct, your Honor.

However

1 think that is the job of the Commission and net. the
defendants .

These defendants have, X believe, in California,

taken over the job of regulating carriers, and thu-y have done
so—they don't have to bribe? they’re too powerful to have to
bribe, they’re too powerful to have.to lie, they have taken
this power and they have used and abused a procedure, a delicate
proceeding of government which is not the Moerr-Pennington
type of behavior.
Q

Well, in Mogrr, X suppose it was the prerogative

of the Governor

to veto or not to veto that so-called bill,

but the allegation in that complaint was that defendants
by their 7political clout and power had forced the Governor
to veto that bill, and the complaint in Noerr

was that whole

course of conduct by the defendants was according to the
complaint, vicious, corrupt, and fraudulent and that their
whole purpose was to absolutely destroy their competitors and

allegations, there was no violation

My understanding is that your argument in this case

MR. KHOURIEs

We know of none.

We do not say by that

that there was always relevant information given as Mr. Lakusta
has argued.

It would be very strange if there were.

There

never has been a law suit where everything was relevant.

Would the legi*lature of California have the power

to meet your problem by providing that after one hearing,
a decision of the Utilities Commission should be made and that
would be unreviewable and then there could be no harassing?
Would they have that power?
MR, KHOURIBs

Yes,

As a. matter of fact? the Public

Utilities Commission is a creature of the legislature,
Q

That would foe a solution to the harassment by

representative appeals and that sort of thing# wouldn’t it?
MR, KHOURIE:

It would be a prospective solution

which «might be achieved by lobbying and persuading

tried to achieve this liberal policy, tha shortening of the
liberal policy they objected to,
