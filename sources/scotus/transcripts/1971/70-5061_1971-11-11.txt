ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P.SBNG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SENGs

Thank you? Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

pleas® the Court.;
The issue presented in this ©as© is a narrow one.
This court granted cert on whether due process requires 'chut an
accused bo advised of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel
prior to a pre-indictment show-up held at a police station
several hours after the accused*s arrest and soma 48 hours
after the alleged crime occurred«
Illinois has held that.counsel is not required at
any pre-indictment show-up.

We subject that this rule is too

broad and that under ths narrow facts of this case counsel
should have been provided.
The fa0ts in this case are not complieatel„
On February 20th, 1968» at about 4s30 in the afternoon,
Willie Shard was walking down a street in Chicago, when he

noticed two men following about 15 feet behind him.
paid no particular attention to them.

Ho, however«

As he turned to enter a

restaurant, a man grabbed him from behind, while another man
took from his pockets $30 or $35 in cash, $145 in traveler's

4
checks, hia wallet, and all his .1 dentificati021 papers»
rih®. rae.il 'then went one way, and Shard want: another.
It was not until the next day that'Shard notified the police
m-d gave them a general description of tbs height, wsight, end
v

complexion of the two men.
Two days later, or. February 22nd, at about 11:00 In
the morning, Thomas Kirby, the petitioner in tills action, and
Ralph Bean 'wore walking down a street in Chicago.

At the

®am© time, two Chicago police officers, Biaggio Pan®pinto and
James Rizsi, were cruising in an unmarked squad car.

Officer

Panepinto remarked to his partner that Kirby resembled
Alphonao Hampton, a man supposedly wanted by the Chicago police
i>.ox perpetrating a con game.

Th© officers then stopped the

two men.
When asked for his identification, Kirby pulled out
his wallet, and as he pulled cut his wallet the officers
noticed traveler's checks bearing the name Willie Shard,

when

asked to whom these checks belonged, Kirby responded that
they were play money, or that he had.won them in a crap game.
Ths officers than searched Bean and found identifica­
tion papers bearing the name Willie Shard.
Q

Bid these arresting officers, at. the time of the

arrasfe, know about the Willie Shard, robbery?
MR„ SENGs

Ho, they didn't, Your Honor.

It. was not

until after they returned to the police station and had checked

5
police records that the officers first learned of this robbery,
and that fact l think is uncontented in this matter,
Q

So that finding the traveler's checks of Willie

Shard wasn't in any way incriminating from — in viaw of ids.®
officers' than knowledge; is that — wall, I’m just trying to
piece together this thing,

I mean, on© of these people

arrested, the petitioner, might have been named Willie Shard;
is that correct?
MR. SEMGs

That’s possible. Your Honor.

We argued probable cause for arrest-in the Illinois
appellate court, and that -Q

That’s not here to be argued,

MR. SENGs
Q

— court decided against ’us.

Right.

MR. SENGs

Right.

When the man were taken to the police station, the
officers, after learning that Willi© Shard had been robbed,
telephoned Shard end told him that they had two suspects whom
they wanted him to look at.

Another officer was sent to pick

up Shard.
When Shard arrived at the police station, Kirby and
Bean, who happened to b© black, war© seated between Officers
P&nepintc and Risssi in a largo squad room.
When Shard entered the room, the officers asked him
if these wore the two men.

Shard responded affirmatively.

6
Wo lineup vms ever held in this case, this was the
only identification that took place before trial.

ht

no time prior to this identification show-* up was

either Kirby or Bean advised of his right fe?

conns®!,

In facts

the Public Defender was not appointed until approximately taven
weeks after their arrest, and eight days after an indictment
was returned,
Prior to trial, Kirby's counsel filed a pretrial motion
to suppress the identification testimony.

This motion was

denied.
At trial, Shard testified that the men in the court­
room on that data were the man whom he identified at the police
station.
Bean waived his privilege against self-incrimination,
and took the stand and testified that

h®

and Kirby found the

traveler's checks strewn in an alleyway several hours prior
to the time of their arrest.
We respectfully submit that this case is directly
con-trolled by this Court’s decision in United 5takes„.yB«_W&de,
and Gilbert vs. California.

The State, at least in its brief,

appears to recognize no meaningful distinction between these
decisions in the case at bar, and therefore urge that Wade and
Gilbert be* overruled.
It is certainly our position that Wade and Gilbert
were rightly decided.

Petitioner should have bean advised of liis right to
counsel in this case.
hours«

H© had fcc.cn at -fell© police, station several

The alleged crime had occurred two days previously.

The State points to no evidence or to no prejudice -that it
would have suffered had counsel been appointed.

Indeed,

i

Illinois statute provides that an accused is entitled to
counsel, to consult with counsel immediately after being
arrested.
Beginning with Powell

Alafcams, this Court has

consistently held that counsel is required

at all critical

stages in the criminal process*
In Wade, this Court reviewed the history of ths Sixth
Amendment and. found that counsel is necessary to assure tit
accused a meaningful defense so that, the accused shall not. be
required to stand alone at any critical stage in the criminal
process*
Recognizing the vagaries of identification testimony,
fch© Court realised that for all practical purposes, that an
accused's guilt may be' determined prior to trial.

The Court

therefore held that an identification confrontation is a
critical stage and that the accused is as much entitled to
counsel at that stag© as he is ©t the trial itself.
Now, fch© Supreme Court of Illinois has held that
counsel is only required at post~indictxnent lineups.

We submit

that this rule exalts form over substance and makes an accused's

8
rights depend upon the timing of the identification confronta­
tion .
Furthermore, w© think kh© Illinois rule alleys” the.
polio© to circ«avent Wade by holding all identification
confrontations prior to indictment.

I think this Court wc«l v

probably be in good company if it decided to overrule the
Illinois rule# in fact all the federal courts, lower federal
courts, and the majority, except five, of the State courts haws
held that the pre-indictment/post-indictment distinction is
meaningless.
This Court recognised that, identification confronta­
tions may b© surrounded with suggested influences.

And. we

submit that these suggested influences may occur either prior •’
or after indictment, but the return of an indictment has
really no relationship to the problem® with which this Court
was involved with in Wad©.
Q

What Illinois wants us to overrule is Wad?,

The United States,
MR. SENG:

va.

[sic1
That's right. Your Honor.

The State make:-

no argument, so far as I can see, that Wade is impossible to
apply? it makes — its argument basically la the fact that
counsel performs no meaningful function at the identification
confrontation.

This Court held in Wage that counsel's pro^ene.:-

will avert prejudice and will assure a meaningful confronta­
tion at trial

3

I think just taking the facts of this case,
readily see that counsel would have had a function»

can
First of.

all# counsel probably would have objected to the fact that
these b>®« were: seated between two police officers, that when
the victim came into the room, that he was directly asked to
point out the accused.
Q

The accused were Negroes?

1®. SENGs
Q

Were the police officers Caucasians?

MR. SENG2
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And in uniform?

MR. SENGs
Q

Yes, that’s right, Your Honor.

1 am not sure that the record —

Doesn’t have to Jmh

MR. SENGs

states that exactly, but 2 think that

they
Q

I meant Gilberts. California is the applicable

case here?
MR. SENGs
Q

Right.

MR. SENGs

Right.

This is a State ~«-

Yes.
Counsel probably, had he been there, would

have requested that the men bt put in a lineup.

Now, fcbs state

argues that the police will not coop©rate with counsel, or that,
even if counsel is present the police will employ sugg@st.iv®
procedures outside th© presence of counsel.
It is our position that# after all the police have

10

no interest in convicting an innocent man, but if counsel is
present and suggests fair procedures, that the polio© probably
»

will cooperate.

Even if counsel's presence is restricted, to a

passive role, we think that his mere presence will indues the
polic® to be mere careful, and especially in this case the.ro
was some conflicting testimony at the trial ®3 to what actually
happened, whether/ indeed, Shard even recognised the man when
he first entered the room.
Q

And these were all Chicago police officers?

MR. SENG:
Q

That’s right, Your Honor.

Has that police department adopted any regula­

tions governing lineup procedures?
MR. SENG:

No, Your Honor.

The State, in it® brief at least, seems to argument
that this Court should concentrate on procedures than on 'the
right to counsel., but Illinois has adopted no p:

tee wbi

bring your statements in gad© into effect, I think.
G

Is tills a Gilbert, or a Wad© case?

Q

Gilbert, I believe.

MR. SENG:
Q

. This is a Gilbert? it5a a State cassa.

Where th&re was reference to the prior identifica­

tion at the trial?
MR. SENG:

Right.

In fact, in the direct testimony

the witness was directly asked by the prosecutor:
th© m©n you identified at the police station?”

“Axe these

XI
Q

So it wouldn't b* 4 question of taint or anything,

it'd just be exclusion?
MR. SENG*
Q

Right, Your Honor.

Par se.

MR. SENG* Right.
Q

And I gather th© only ground on which Gilbert

was not applied was that this was a pre-indictment shewup or
whatever it was?
MR. SENG*

That is th® only ground. Your Honor,

And before this, case was argued in the —Q

Was there any suggestion in the Illinois courts

that but for that fact Gilbert would have been applied?
.MR., SENG;

Well, this case was decided by the

Illinois Appellate Court, and prior to this case th© Illinois
Supreme Court had ruled on People vs. Palmer that counsel is
not required at th© prs-indictmant lineup,

So that tines Illinois

Appellate Court mainly relied upon th© Illinois Supremo Court's
judgment.

The Illinois Supreme Court's opinion is vary brief

in this case, it jusfc simply states that they are going to hold
Wad® and Gilbert to its narrow respects, and that is to

&

post-

indie tmenfc s i fcuati on.
Q

What's the procedure in Illinois?

You arrest

someone, do you file a charge against them?
MR. SENG*
Q

Normally —• yes, the complaint is —

Th® compalint is filed, and then there is an

12
indictaa&nfc lator.
MR, SENG:
Q

Right.

And this was post-arrest, in-custody, post-

charge?
MR, SENG;

Yes.

Well, I don't, think, from the

record, there would probably be a complaint •*- a compl
been filed yet.
Q

There is no evidence in the record.
But it was post-arrest, and there is no challenge

by anyone that there was & probable cause to arrest?
MR, SENG;
Court.

This was argued in the Illinois Appellate

No, I think it's significant that in the State’s

brief in this Court, the State, for the first time,.states that
Kirby was arrested on suspicion.

Now, it was our position in

the Illinois Appellate Court that if ho was arrested on
suspicion that that would not b-a probable cause. And I think
if the State had taken that position in the Illinois Appellate
Court, the appellat® court might havs dons the same thing that
it did in the companion case of Bean, where it was held that
there was no probable cause for the arrest and suppressed the
identification on that ground.
It i® our position that the function of counsel at
the identification will aid in the administration of justice.
If the accused is innocent, it will aid in establishing his
innocence? if he’s guilty, by having counsel at the identification,
at 'the earliest opportunity, it will, I think as this Court.

13
recognised in Wade, it will help remove the taint from tas
prosecution's evidence,, and ramybe focedcee many of the
arguments at trial and posttrial motions that were brought up
in this cas©.
Furthermore, x don't think requiring counsel at pre~
indictment showup in any way will delay the cenfrontatic-n.
The state points to no empirical evidence that this is so in
any of the majority of jurisdictions which require counsel.
Q

You aren't urging the rule that goes prior to

arrest and custody, are you?
MR. SENG:

Honor

That is not involved in this case, Your

o

Q

But arc? you urging the rule that would?

MR. SENG:

No.

The majority of States havs

recognised an exception for immediate on-fche-sceno confronta­
tions, but that really .-isn't involved in this case, because -—
Q

Then you are not wring the rule that would

reach those?
MR. SENG:
Your Honor., no.,

Not — not on the facts of this esse,

2 don't want tc preclude an argument in
The distinction the majority of courts have

mad© is the pro — immediate on~the-sc@n© confrontation?
counsel may be excused in that situation.

But beyond that,

then counsel is required —

MR. SENG3 That would create some problems in my mind.
I think you would still have a suggestive —
Q

So you really aro pressing for a rule that would

reach these pre-custody cases, then?
MR. SENG;

Well, I don't ‘think that has to be

15
decided in this case, but 2 think *— my own feeling is that
if th© police had done this t that this would bo a situation
where probably they should coll tha man to the police station
and give him the procedures# Your Honor»
y

In other words, you’re going to require him to

have a lawyer.
Let's take not the case at the police station* but
take it just the way Justice White gave it to you.

They -tak

the witness to go out with a plainclofchesman .and view this mm
while he's cutting his lawn or shopping in the supermarket,
whatever.

Have to go up to him and say# "Sir, waits about

to have asm© witnesses look at you, and it’s our duty to warn
you that you are entitled to counsel before they look at you."
Is that the procedure?
MR» SENGs

I don’t really se® a great deal of difficulty

in. a procedure like that# unless there are# you know# .compelling
circumstances or something like that.

I think very possibly

that the police could inform the accused that he had a right to
counsel in that situation.
The Court in Wade seems to indicate that an accused
can waive the right to counsel# too.

And I would imagine that

would be a question under State procedure# as to how h© would
waive the right.
Q

I'm not sure# but —

I suggest to you that most innocent people

would resent the idea of a policeman approaching them while

16

they're cutting their law» or at their work or in some other
such place.

You're telling them to get a l.awyar before they

have some witnesses look at them.
MR. SENG:

Well, I don't think 'the rule, would to,

you know, that they'd be required to get a lawyer or anything
like that.

I think it's just
Q

-*•

Or a warning.

MR. SENG:
Q

&

— you know —

VJhen a policeman gives a warning to anyone,

this puts him in a rather special kind of class, doesn't it.?
MR. SENG:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

But I think the Court —

I submit a suspect class.

In the sense that we

us© that term here.
Q

Wall, Mr. Seng, in the Chief Justice's case,

you corns up with the two witnesses and they say, they give
them all the Miranda, and all of the other warnings, and he
says»

"1 won't do anything until

1

se® my lawyer. •'

Could

those two witnesses forget that they saw him?
The man's out mowing hia lawn —
MR. SENGs
Q

Right.

— and three people com© up, fch© detective and

the 'too witnesses, and the detective says, "I have two witnesses
that I would like to identify you or not identify you, or whathave-you; but you don '-t have
a lawyer.®

And he says,

to

submit to this unless you have

"Well, I won't submit to it."

Now what happen»?
Those two witnesses can't testify?
MR. SENG:

Wall. 1 would suggest that probably in a

situation like that, that maybe the police shouldn't hsw& taken
tiia witnesses right to that man initially.
Q

There is —

So thay get two demerits; what else?

MR. SENG:

Your -- under this Court’s ruling in Wade,

if direct evidence of the confrontation wan not admitted in
trial,, 1 think there’d have to be a hearing that this identifi­
cation confrontation was, you know, given by independent
evidence at the identification ■—
Q

Th® reason I raise it, because in this case they

were under arrest.
MR. SENG:
Q

That’s right, Your Honor.

For what?

Is there anything in the record to show what they
were arrested for?
MR. SENG:

Not really, Your Honor.

because thay resembled another man.

They wear® stopped

Between the time that they

were stopped and the time that they were taken to the police
station, the officers found these traveler’s checks and
identification papers.
Q

But they weren’t — he wasn't the other man

that they were looking for,
Q

Not the con man?

18
ME. SENGs

No.

No, sad. that — therefa no issue.

«ado of that in this case, that —~
Q

There’s nothing in the record to show what they

ware arrested for?
ME. SLMG;
Q

No.

But the record does show clearly that they ware

in custody and were carried to the station?
ME. SENG;

That’s right, Your Honor.

And I think that’s really all that this Court has
to decide in this case, really, is that they were in custody,
they had been there for several hours, and the crime had
occurred two days previously.
1 would just like to summarize by stating that it
is our position that Wad® is rightly decided, that these are
very — the right to counsel is a fundamental right? that the
Illinois pre-indicfcmenfc/posfc"indictment distinction really.'is
not a meaningful rule when you’re considering the rationale for
this Court’s decision in Wade.

AFTERNOON SESSION

MR. CHIEF OtfciTXCE BURGER:

Mr. SageX? you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUTENT OF JAMES 3» ZAGEL? ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, ZAGELs

Mr, Chief Justice? may it; please the

Court:
Before discussing the merits on the legal principiet
involved? I’d like to clarify two or three of the factual
situations involved in this case.
The arrest occurred? as counsel for the petitioner
indicated? because two police officers thought that the
petitioner here looked like a man wanted for a con game? a msus
named Hampton.
The two police officers stopped the two people? the
petitioner and his partner.

They asked the petitioner if he

was Hampton, he said no? he was not Hampton.
.if ho had any identification.

The police asked

When the petitioner pulled, out

nis wallet? the officer noted traveler’s chocks in the
petitioner’s wallet.

He said? ”Who do the checks belong to?”

At which time the petitioner said? *0h, that’s- play money.”
After that? the officer said, “Let me s.ss the?*.**
And the petitioner handed the wallet to the 'officer, who looked
at th® traveler’s checks which had the name Willie shard on
them? and said? “who is Willi© Shard?”

To which the petitioner

20
responded, ”1 won them in a crap gam®.”
Th&

appellato court of Illinois uphold that initial

arrest on the grounds that the contradictory explanations for
the possession of the property plus the absence of any
identification that this man was in fact Willie Shard.
Now, during the course of our brief, vie discuss
several rules of application for Wad©, United States vs. wade,
and when I refer to United &tatea va„ Wade, I of course includo
Gilbert vs,;California? but for convenience I referred in the
brief and will refer in the argument to Wade.
We point out that there is one exception, at least
the Second Circuit has recognised that for investigatory
©howups or investigatory confrontations.

When that, argument

■was advanced, the petitioner replied thats

well, this means

that my client, the petitioner, was arrested on grounds of
suspicion? that an investigatory ©stop of this nature was not
based on probable cause, and if that position had been taken
below then this case would not be here today.
I have to differ with petitioner’s counsel.

It seems

to mat that Hof fa vs. United Stafes, in 385 U.S., definitely
rejected the proposition that investigatory

investigative

steps cannot be said to occur after probable cause existed*
I think in this case that 'there was probable causa, and that,
as far as this showup was concerned, that it still constituted
an investigatory showup.

I'd also point out with respect to this c&so, w©

rais® two points t

the fi

. is that we cs dofvvd- tvivjdtc

the petitioner’s assertion to the contrary, tha limitation of
Wads to post-indictment cases, that is Point 1 of our brief.
We also attack, as is our right sines we are defending a
judgment; we also raise the broader ground of the overruling
of Wad®.
I’d address myself first to the question of overruling.
I’d also point out that when w® asked for the overruling of
Wade, we are not asking for the overruling of Stovall vs.^
Penn©, which recognised explicitly a due process, a right
under the dm process clause to attack unnecessarily suggestive
pretrial confrontation.
If Wade, United States vs. Wade, is overruled by
this court, it does not put out of the reach of the federal
court and of this Court questions of suggestive confrontation•
Those, of course, can still be reviewed under the dm process
clause insofar as that right was recognised under Stovall vb,

tec,

MR. SAGIsLj
Q

— Illinois provided counsel in the ■—

Well, that was a matter of State law, wasn’t it?

MR. ZhQhhi

Yes.

And of course the State requires

that i wouldn't be in a position to ask.
U

I was wondering where you draw the line under

the Sixth Amendment, as applicable by the Fourteenth?
MR. SAGLLs

Well, I would *— it is at that, point,

Mr. Justice Douglas, that I wish fco express myself directly.
The Wad® case, the Wade-Gilbert doctrine, adopted the right fco
counsel at lineups under a critical-stage theory, which of
course is familiar, at least the language is familiar.

The

essential basis of the opinion was that, v/here the action ©£
counsel might affect the reliability of the fact-finding
procedure.

That is a critical stage, and the right to counsel

attaches.
Now, my first submission is that that is entirely
too broad a standard.

Because the presence of counsel, at

least if you assume that counsel's interest is in a fair
investigation, and 1 think there is some doubt of it.

But

All of these cases present instances in which the

And I think that counsel for the petitioner is quite,

correct in his reluctance to state that he would net contend
that the right to counsel attaches to these points.

not wish to reach these issues, because, frankly, under the

2 think Kirby was entitled to counsel,

under Coleman vs» Alabama, at the time of his preliminary

That was how many days later?

MR. ZAGELx

I don't know how many days later it was,

but it was after the identification.
When was h© charged with robbery?
MR. ZAGEL2

I think he was charged with robbery

after the identification by Shard.

X don't, think there was a

formal charge entered, and it —

Q

Well, what were you holding him on?

MR» ZAGELs

I think they were holding him because

they had probable cause to believe that he had stolen the
traveler’s checks.

But of course they didn't know until Shard

made the identification»
Q

So, so far as this record is concerned, we don’t

What does the record show?

MR. ZAGELs

own, and we know that he gave two totally inconsistent
explanations for his possession of those checks.

27
U

And what crime was that?

MR. ZAGELs

Well, I think it gives probable: causes to

believe that ha may have stolen those checks.

MR. ZAGEL?

Q

Yes, he was under arrest.

And so the cases you give about immediately

after the crime, they don't apply — wasn't it two days after
th® crime?

29

HR* ZAGEL:

Well, except ray point is that I don’t

think you can draw a distinction based on the fact that the man
is under arrest.
Q

I see.

MR. ZMiEL:

if it is possible,-if identifying a man

who is under arrest, in a single shcwup, standing with two
police officers standing on either side of him, is critical,
has potentiality for suggestivsnaoa, which requires the right
to counsel, it's no different if it occurs shortly after tsw
crime.

it’s no different — the same potential for suggestion

exists,

Th® same potential for suggestion exists when a man,

who is not in custody, say a man is working at a gas station

&nd the police suspect him of the crime and bring a coupIs of
witnesses by and point him out.
Mow, I*m .not saying that it’s important —
Q

But isn’t it true they didn't have the slightest

idea about the crime when they arrested him?
MR. «AGEL;

In a sense.

They did not know that Willie

Shard had been robbed, but it would be a very dense police
officer who, faced with this — 'these two conflicting explana­
tions plus th© lack of any identification of the person ia
possession of th© checks as Willie Shard, it would be a very
dense police officer v;ho would not have pretty good reasons,
at least legally sufficient reasons to suspect that this man
had stolon that property,

Or at least was in the possesion of

30
stolen property.
Hew, I don't know, perhaps if only one of the explanafelons had bean given — although the "play money" on© seems
incredible — that maybe the officer might not have had
probables cause.
Q

• Petitioner hasn’t challenged the arrest here,

has he?
MR. ZAGBLj

He has not challenged the arrest hare.

Now, I point out also that in Wade the' court was
concerned with the potential for deliberate police suggestion#
deliberate police misconduct.
that:

But yet the court in Wade said

Wo’re not going to hold that the taking of a blood

test or the taking of handwriting exemplars as a critical stage.
I would point that there is almost, although not
quite the same potential for abuse in those cases, requiring
idia presence of counsel as there is in the eye-witness identifl*

cation cases.

It’s at least theoretically possible that the

police, if they were mailicious, might use improper methods of
taking blood, or they might just say that the blood taken from
— that they testify was' taken from the defendant was never
taken from the defendant.

And counsel, of course, had h©

witnessed the taking of bleed, would b® in a position to insure
the reliability of the fact-finding procedure.
The final point made, I think, with respect t© the
rational© within Wad®, is that the petitioner in a lineup, when

he challenges the lineup, has a horrible' problem reconstructing
v/hafc occurred *
Now, X don't know that the problem exists.

For

example, there didn’t seem to be a great deal of difficulty in
reconstructing what occurred in. Wade or what occurred in Gilbert
or what occurred in Stovall.

There doesn’t eeem to have been,

although there is minor disagreement, there doesn't seen fee
have been much difficulty reconstructing what occurred in til if
case«
And furthermore, that problem of reconstruction
exists in ovary on© of the excepted cases under Wade.

The same

problem of reconstruction of prompt identification, the same
problem of reconstruction ©£ photographic identification, all
exist.
The theory, the critical-stage theory of Wade, I
submit, is without rational limitations.

Q

Sixth?

MR. ZAGELs
Q

Of course.

MR. ZAGELs
Q

— Sixth.

The more important, and I think it is —

It seems to me one possible reason for conetruing

the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments as requiring the presence
of counsel at a lineup is the sort of preventive — preventive
reasons.

With counsel there, ever, though he may never have

to testify or never have to say anything about the lineup or
■fchat may never com© up, but just his very presence may serve
to assure a fair lineup.

Isn’t that — could that possibility

be —
MR. ZAGELs
Q-

Yes.

I didn't notice that in your brief.
\

MR, ZAGELs

No, we

have considered that,

w® have

considered that —
Q

But now in your oral argument you ere agreeing

that that could be.
MR, ZAGELs

Yes.

We considered that expressly in

the brief, and our concern with that point is that you have ©
difficult problem if you assume that — if either assumption
is taken, in fact, that counsel is present and he doesn’t
effectuate a fair lineup, or if counsel is present and he does.

33
If be doesn't, effectuate a fair lineup, he's in a
position where he must testify as a witness, which may
disqualify him from representing the defendant at counsel.
Furthermore, as Professor Read points out'in his article,
there's really no reason to believe that the attorney, on behalf
of the defendant, is likely to be viewed as any more impartial
when he testifies than the defendant himself is.

So I think

that —
Q

Well, I'm assuming in my question that ha never

will testify, he'll never need to testify, and he'll never naac
to refer to the lineup, because the lineup was fairly conducted
because of his presence.
MR. ZAGELt

tive, which is to say that the remedy is effective.

The

problem with that is that he may still have to testify.

What's wrong with him testifying to th© truth?

MR. SAGELi

Well, that brings the next point;

if he's

successful and he either has to testify against his client or
he says to his client;

And that is why 1 think

counsel is a particularly inappropriate vehicle for the regula­

We point out that the regulation of lineups can be
accomplished under the due process clause under Stovall, if
it is thought -that there is a sufficient danger of improper
identification procedure.
But counsel is not the appropriate technique to use»
Q

MR. 2&GEL:

Would you repeat your question, Mr.

Justice Marshall?
Q

You wouldn’t have to call defense counsel as a

You are so interested in protecting the

He could only be a witness if the

Ineffective assistance of counsel.

MR. SAGELs

~ ineffective assistance of counsol.

Or, to- put it in the vernacular of a client, as he
once addressed it to me when X said I wasn’t going to raise a
search-and seizure question,, he said, "Whose side are yon an'?"
And that is not. going to benefit the administration
of criminal justice*

X might also add that this has to be

viewed in context of the fact that there is very little in the
way of legal resources;?,, that; is to say, lawyers to meet the
problem of counsel at lineup.
In fact, in on® case, the Randolph 'case which is cited
in our brief, ‘the District of Columbia which has a provision,
the Legal Aid Agency apparently provides counsel.

Counsel was

happened?"

In effect, what counsel did is that he testified
from his notes.

Now, I don’t know why hie notes are going to

be better than a photograph at the lineup.
Q

Well, isn't the photograph of a lineup a

practical way of assuring the fairness?
MR. Z&GELs

1 think it. is a practical way of assuring

all of the fairness -chat the presence of counsel is supposed
to assure.

There are some questions of fairness that

admittedly not even counsel can assure.

Per example, before

the lineup the police can say to a man, to the witness, "The
man who’s the third one from the left, w® found your stolen
property in his house, and he's got a record as long as your *
arm, and he's done it many times, and several people who saw
him come out of your house have identified him."
Now, that's a clearly suggestive practice, but that's
not something that is reached under the right to counsel in
any event; that’s reached under the -due process aspect of
Stovall v. Oenno.
Q

I was merely going to ask is photography of

lineups in practice in many places., to your knowledge?
MR. SAGEIis

No, it is not. Thero is a — tiisrs was

language in the opinion in Hade that suggested that perhaps
administrative regulation would obviate the necessity for
counsel. Th© problem with that language, and the problem with
asking States 'to rely on that language, is that thro® of the
Justices who concurred with the majority opinion explicitly
rejected that/ the fourth Justice who concurred said nothing
on th© point.

And so far ©s I know the only case which has

dealt with administrative regulations is the Fowler case in the
Supreme Court of California, where they just simply said that
the regulations would have to he so strong as to insure that
there is no suggestiveness.
Q

Tell me, has the police department adopted any

kind of regulations to assure fairness of lineup?
MR. 2AGEL:

Yes.

But there's an existing regulation

which existed before th© time of. Wade, Gilbert, or Stovall,
which prescribed certain procedures for lineups.
enough, defense counsel have not used that.
they haven't.

Strangely

I don't know why

They have never called the police in aha used

I-.don't

know why.
Q

provide methods for assuring that the regulations are
provided.

But Chicago hasn’t dene anything on that?
ME. 2AGEI.S

Wo.

Wo, there was, prior to the time

of the Palmer decision, there were some draft regulations
concerning right to counsel, and many police officers, of
course, were aware of the decision; and there are a fair number
of cases involving warnings, as to right to counsel, and even
a few in which counsel was present at the lineup.

But there

have been no formal regulations promulgated as a .result of those*
decisions.
I point, out that -~
Q

But X think the opinion in Wade suggested that,

the prescriptions of that opinion might be supplanted by
equally effective regulations.
MR. S&GEL %

Yes, but I would submit that it would be

difficult for me, for example, advising the police, to say
that that aspect of the opinion was holding the court.

iSo far

as I could infer, Mr. Justice Brennan, you were the only
Justice of the Court who definitely committed himself to that
proposition, although perhaps Mr. Justice Clark did, as well.
But three of us who joined with you in the opinion did
not adhere to that.

That is why, if it had been a little more

41
clearcut, perhaps, we might be arguing a different issue today.
ted that, l think, is responsible for the reluctance of the
California Supreme Court to approve the regulations in the
Fowler case.
Q

Mr. Sagel, do you draw any —■ am I right that

this identification as mors:- for the purpose of arrest —■ X mean
I 'm trying fco get to my problem with, the two arrests — was
for the purpose of holding him on this robbery charge, not
for the purpose of convicting him.

Do yon make any point of

that?
MR. ZAGELs

No.

I think that it was investigatory

in the sense that X think if Shard had said,

"No, that’s not

the man”, they would have been released,
Q

That’s what I mean.

MR. ZAGELs

It was

I think it was investigatory

in nature.
Q

And that takes it out of Wad® and Gilbert?

MR. 55 AGE L:

I think 'that that is. an additional reason

for taking it out of Wade and Gilbert, if Wade and gilbert is
the stance.
Q

I see <.

MR. SAGELs

In conclusion, I simply state that as

far as Wade is concerned, and Gilbert involves the insertion
of counsel into a role in which ha has neither the capacity,
authority, or ethical obligation fco fulfill and fulfill

adequately ♦

And that insertion cf counsel into that situation

require it, ought to b© overruled.

The

The crime had occurred two days

There is no contention in this case but that the

do not think that this is a proper rule.

I

Now, counsel for the

State has cited several rules in oilier jurisdictions.

The

immediate on-the-scene confrontation; the leading decision in
that area, I think, is Russell vs. United States, in th© D. C.
Circuit, where the court distinguishes that situation from a
later confrontation on the grounds that in that case the
witness's memory is fresh and that makes the identification at

They called Shard to causa down to the

police station.
I think it has passed from the investigatory stage
into a specific focus of guilt upon these two ia©n if they
commit this robbery, and X think that's the reason by Shard
was called down to the police station.
Q

What if, as your friend has suggested, Shard

had said, "Wo, these are not -the men"?
MR. SENGs Well, Your Hon©r, 1 think that points to
the critical nature of the identification in this case, that
that was really what the State was relying upon to convict

I think in tills case» where they were being held down

down to identify two suspects, that I think the focus is

had been the same day?
MR. SENG:
