This o-ss© is before th© Court upon appeal from a
tb?®o~judge court of th® District of Oregon, affirming a
of the Interstate Commarca Commission.
Tho jurisdiction of this--Court is conferred by 20
U.S.C. 1253.
Tide ersej arose when two of th© four railroads
serving Portland filed an application with th© Commission for
aritho*’ity to acquire control of th® Peninsula Terminal Company,
undor Suction 5(2) of th© Interstate Commerce Act.
Th® two acquiring railroads were Union Pacific and
Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway.

anticipated that within the foreseeable future

ttial new traffic and revenues would be derived from
PeniEsula Terminal# as a result of the development of 'the

It is this substantial new traffic and revenues which
will b© generated by Rivargat® that has prompted the great
interest in this case.

iuuy bring their vehicles to their customers' doors in Rivergate*
So, also, it is our contention that the public
interest requires that all four line-haul railroads serving
Portland must also have direct, access to Rivergate shippers and

receivers.
Accordingly, when Union Pacific —

MR. TATUMs There are three lines, the red.one, the '

vx zzr. ono, and the yellow one, which indicate the interchange
b: rwc.sn Union Pacific, Burlington Northern, and Peninsula
Terminal.
There is considerable controversy in the case of
whether or not mere equal ownership of Peninsula would permit
Southern Pacific or Milwaukee actually to get tc Peninsula.

So, to b© very careful, counsel for both of those
lines filed applications under Section 3(5) —

I think in attempting to make our

These linas that you

actually ©11 joint~own*rship lines, they are owned jointly by

10
Burlington Nurkharn, Union Pacific, and Peninsula; or combina­
tions of them.
So that under the language of Condition 24 of the
Northern Lines, which starts outs

To the extent that the

new company is unable to do so, they will grant trackageThey now take the position that because Union Pacific
is a partner in this, Burlington Northern does not. have the
right, under Condition 24 of the Northern Lines, to grant them
access.
Q

You mean from Point 3 on the Burlington

K-"?rtiarn. all the way to Point 8, Milwauke has no rights now?
T&TUMs

Yes.

They can go over it, Your Honor,

but the testimony is that in order to get a car from Milwaukee
•

Peninsula they will have to bring that car into Point 3

and then turn it over to Burlington Northern to switch it back
to Peninsula Terminal.
This is on© of the real arguments in the case.
Q

Well, that isn’t — I gather that isn't exactly

what your opponents say isn’t so, is it?
MR. TATUMs Well, I -Q

Well, all right, go ahead.

MR. TATUM:

I’m sorry.

Our opponents say it doesn't make any

difference.
v

11 out continue further with the discussion of

how the case get: here; I think the Court is informed of the

1.1

facts of how w© ar® here.
When v?© want into the district court with then
complaint by the Port and the Public Utility Commissioner,
Southern Pacific and Milwaukee joined us„

The United States, as

nominal defendant, filed a brief in support, saying the case
should be remanded; in this case the United States has likewise
filed a brief, in support ©f remand.
Let's turn to the Milwaukee ownership which we
discussed under the Northern Lines case.

Wa contend that by refusing Milwaukee a part owner­
ship in the Peninsula Terminal, the Commission has turned its
back on what it said In approving the Northern Lines Merger,

namely, a- vl competition lost between Great Northern and
icrkh/ra Pta.Lfic would bcs substantially offset by greatly

enhanced competition from Milwaukee.
And hart:, in th© very first time this comes up,
in the vary first context, as they com® into Portland they’re
told you have
to go right by and go down to Hoyt Yard and com® •
5
back „

The entire purpose of Condition 24, as I read it,
in the Commission’s decision and in this Court’s decision, was
to permit Milwaukee to become a line-haul competitive carrier

with hi . . caw Burlington Northam, replacing th® Northern
Pacific end Great Northern.
thlc c

g-.’ing on at exactly the ©am® tin® as th©

£

12

Ia faci., we extend, and it*s set forth in vary
brief summary in the Justice Department's brief on page 14,
that this agreement and this acquisition of Peninsula Terminal
may well have been den© to thwart what if as coming in Condition
24 of the Northern Lines agreement.
Q

Now, does Condition 24 assure Milwauke of

trackage rights on that green line, from 3 to 8?
MR. TATUM;

Q

Yes, sir.

It assures them of trackage

yes, sir?
Kell, isn't 3 to 8 also jointly owned by

MR. TATUMs

No, there1s some joint use, but it’s not

Q

Oh, The only one that's jointly owned is which?

Just Peninsula?
MR. TATUMs

Mo, some of those — those throe turnouts

that we have, by Peninsula Terminal, ©11 of them are jointly
owned.

MR. TATUMs Aud it's because of that joint ownership
that they say they can keep it out,

But in that they agreed that they

So they have effectively foreclosed Milwaukee at

that point.

And certainly it's apparant to us that this was well in the
Riiad of ©11 feh® parties at th® time fch© transaction was being
taken up with Peninsula Terminal.
q

Well,'are you saying that they are now giving

effect to both agreements that predated the final Burlington
Northern Lines Merger agreement?

MR, TATUMs

yes, sir.

u
And tho condition, as I said earlier, starts out
with the .parenthetical statements

r.:;--'

To the extent that Burlington

■ \s ok loojco is permitted to do so, it shall permit

HiIwauke® in.
on.fi yet their hands in Portland have been effectively
tioflr certainly as far as this great public industrial
development at Rivergata is concerned-, by these restrictive
o.oooo.o.cixts that they have entered into•

And we contend that

therefore Milwaukee, in this acquisition case, should be
granted fch© right to control Peninsula or have a share in -the
control of Peninsula, and also should have a right to get
trackage rights to get in there, under the Wortham Lines
decision.
We also feel that the public interest requires
Scnttv.vrn Pacific to get in there, so that all four major
; '.i

■ .

l coxof ooo will ba able to serve Portland.
q

Mr. Tatuw, if you prevail here, would this be a

cedant with respect to any other industrial developmen
r:ravGjc instituted?
KP. TLTXMt

W® fe©l that eas@s that we b®va cited

in ear brief, and which Justice has cited in theirs, that
similar kinds of port developments have been granted equal
access by all ©f the line-haul carriers in there.

The Calumet

Port case is one which comas to my mind immediately that was
citad.

15
Q

W3.ll,, suppose, as was sot the cas© here , on®

railroad was instrvKsentai in creating the industrial developmani, would it have to share, than, with everybody

MR. TATUM;

q1b&?

Th&t is a circumstance that we don't

have, and therefore I don't know, This is not a. railroad
di-vo^pv'xnt, this is a public development.

The railroad just

to go fey ut the feline» end it's only through uhe io“
fusion of public money that this lowlying land is being able
be developed into this excellent port and industrial
facility.

So therefore it belongs to no railroad.

This is

an® of the points that the Commission got off on m deciding

that this was an invasion of Union Pacific and Burlington
Northern5 s territory *
q

Let sn@ ask on® on the other side of the

question,

1 take it that River gat a was very little

developed, if at all, at the time of the Northern Lines

dgresaaent.
ICR, TATUM*

It. was just getting underway, Your Honor;

that is correct.
Q

no you think that if it had been brought along

four cr five years further in its development at that time it
would have been taken into consideration an the Northern Lines

agreement?
MR, TATUM*

I don't knew whether it would have been

taken into consideration in the Northern Lines case, but I

16
think had. the Peninsula Terminal acquisition com® up four or
five years after the Horfchsrn Linas had been implemented# the
Commission would have taken more cognizance of Rivergate and
its importance than it did in its decision.
It’s on© of our contentions that all that the
Commission did was concentrate on this little 3.79-mile railroad with a declining number of cars — I think only 2700 in
1967, the evidence year*

Of which Southern Pacific had but

17 prxr^nt, and Milwaukee had hut one percent.

And the ICC

— the Coev-aissicn said, Well, such a little railroad as

this and such a small amount of traffic, lot’s not worry about
this industrial development.

And in so doing cut Milwaukee out

of fcfe.e single biggest industrial are© that possibly could b©
in Portland.
Q

well,

you’d b© making the same argument, I

suppose* if Milwaukee end the Northern owned jointly that track
age from 3 to 8?
MR. TATUM$ Well —
q

You'd hi making th© same argument that it is

ontih2.3d to jointly own the Peninsula?
MR. TATUMs

Yea, sir.

It not only is access, but

jplnfc ownership enables thorn to participate in routes and
divisions and rate3, which they could net do if they merely

had access.
q

well, isn’t Peninsula obligated, as a common

17
carrier, to serve Milwaukee like any other road with the same
rates?

MR. TATUM:

Yes, sir? but this is a peculiar hybrid

typ® of railroad, and —
Q

So they could get. into it. -- so they can get the

©witching service to get into Rivergate *—■
MR. TATUM:
Q

from Peninsula?

MS. TATUM:
Q

Yes, sir.

At fell® saiae rates as anybody els©?

ICR* TATUM:
Q

Yes, sir.

Yets, sir.

They can switch

Moll, then, what’s the importance- of the joint

ownership?
MS. TATUM: Well, thay can go to Barnes *-«**
Q

I know that one advantage is; if it’s © profitable

railroad they’d share in the profits? -that’s for sure. But
MR. TATUM: They cmi g© to Hoyt Yard and switch back
to Peninsula and absorb the switching charge and lose a day’s
advantage over the other*
Q

Well, now, let’s talk of — let’s just assum®
mC *v?.lv’a';ks© jointly own th© track from 3 t© 8,

T-r.

yt’-ird still be making the same argument —
HR. TATUM:
Q

Mo, that’s not —

~~ ©bent jointly owning this one?

MR. TATUM?

I’ll try to address myself to that.

18
The Peninsula Terminal Company, as th® record shows#
does not get its money by a switching charge.

There is a

switching charge from Point 3 to Point — to Peninsula Road?
that's the switching charge.
Q

1 ses.

MR. TATUMs But when it gets to Peninsula# then it's
a division rate# which is a negotiated rate.

Now# there is a

lot of confusion in this in the Commission's brief.
Q

Well# but doesn't it. have to have fche equal

terms with everybody?
SIR. TATUM?

’ No# sir.

No, sir.

I'll cite a case to Your Honor# the LfiN Railway
Company v. The United States# 242 U.S, 69# which holds that a
railroad in this situation does•not have to treat others on the
same* basis as they treat their owners.
Q

So# what you’re saying is it will cost —

because of fcho joint ownership of Union Pacific and Northern#
it may cost the Milwaukee more to get that switching service
than —
MR. TATUM:

And also joint ownership will permit

©very industry that locates in Rivergate and is served by
Milwaukee to fo© an on-jin© Milwaukee industry# if there is
joint ownership.
Q

Well# y©a# but that isn't — it's only on-line

in t's-ryr^G that they jointly own another railroad company.

19
MR. T&TUM$ But they are then entitled fco publish
their through rates.

They issue the billing.

It’s handled as

if it’s their own ear* and it's — I’m getting into different
parts of my argument ahead of time.

Q

Well* that's all right? I’m sorry.

MR. TATUM:

1 didn't —

Well* that's all right.

It’ll be single carrier routing, it will be improved
terminal service if they're a part of the owner.

Common

ownership assures the use of modem railroad technology* and
there will b© rate benefits by them, all three, being common
owners.
I should also like to comment on the strange
rv furt that Burlington Northern and Union Pacific adopted
in this case.

In the brief which is filed to this Court, they

m:x'.3 a settlement offer fco Milwaukee, which is sn extremely
strang© place in a proceeding to try to make a settlement
offer.
We contend it’s a last-minute recognition of the
f

fact that the Commission was wrong* whan it decided ther$- would
be no detriment to the public.
This offer really doesn't give Milwaukee anything
other than the saving of m unnecessary switch charge — tills
goer: fco hr. Justice tritr’s question.

to deliver cars to

Par-iasuis, sad possibly a savings in time.

tr-.-vcrc, Burlington

Northern and Union Pacific, under

:■

thn o-> fer they m-a&s, will still control Peninsula.

They can

ca.akar l its davalopmsmfc, as wall as the development of Rivergate.

They have still been able to insert themselves between

Milwaukee and Rivergate by this controlled company.
We think that this recognition of their — their own
recognition, certainly demands that it be remanded.
Now, I’ve spoken a great deal about Milwaukee in this
argument, because they are in a slightly different factual
situation because of the Northern Lln&s Merger case.

But we

feel the public interest equally requires Southern Pacific to
have access to this industrial area.
The same benefits of single routing, improved terminal
service, modern technology, end rate benefits would apply if
ths Sourhern Pacific was equally there.
The testimony in this case is that there is an

•:;;'P-:lliisg, over 30-hour delay in delivering a Southern Pacific
car frarn Point 6 to Point 7.
traverse that 5*2 miles.

It takes them over 30 hours to

Now, obviously, that traffic isn*t

being handled as expeditiously as it can, even on this little
small volume that the Peninsula Terminal carries now.

How

can they possibly handle five to six hundred care a day with
delays like that?
Mr. Chief Justice, l would like to reserve the

balance of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well.

is ;.r: wore to assume that the Rivergate

that this railroad. Peninsula Terminal Company, will be the
access into North Kivergat©*
For one thing, Peninsula provides only on® of three
routes into the area.

Th@ first rout® to reach the North

Rivergat© area would be an extension of an industrial spur
that in already through the Hlwsgato property, the industrial
spur 1:, t already serves most of the plants presently situated
there.

and that’s owned by the Port of Portland?

Yes* Your Honor.

.

And the land for

that las been ®equi:s»d, such of it has been filled, and graded,

to parrait fcfc© construction,
The witnesses for fch® Port ©f Portland readily
acknowledged that th@r® were these alternatives * and that no

24
selection of the route into North Rivergate had been. mad®.
The condition of the Peninsula Terminal Company and
i fcs structural limitations suggests that it really will never
become the route into North Rivergat©.

Its tracks, which are

of relative light weight, are built upon sand.

Its clearances,

passing as it does through a trestle and carrying the main line
of the Burlington Northern overhead, is of limited dimensions.
Finally, the line itself is limited by the heavy curvatures.

m the Peninsula line leave© the trestle beneath the
Burllayvan Northern, it crosses at grad® and without electric
WJ.:\ :ii;: ;r device the North Portland Road, which connects, just a
few blocks away, with Interstate Highway 5.
Indeed, the leading witness for the Port of Portland,
Dr. Grosvenor Plowman, acknowledged that Peninsula could not
handle tta projected traffic to and from Rlvergnftej h©
acknowledged, on cross-examination, that Peninsula would have
to be redesigned, rebuilt.

And the fact established that

the 100-car trains, which ha indicated the development of
Rivergafc® required, could not even fit upon the tracks of
the Peninsula Terminal Company•

tha'- x
owiw

I. assume now you are going to gat to a point

in doubt on, how this relates to whether it should be
. a limited v/ay or © broad way.
MR. KAHN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Tbs significant thing in this case, really, is that

25
not require
ownership.
Joint, and equal ownership of a terminal company has
never been required to enable connecting trunk-line railroads
to effectively servo industries upon that terminal company,
just within the Portland area — and I would like at
this point to refer the Court to the map which is at Appendix
355

~

q

You are talking about the stock ownership?

i3S. ShHH:

■.i--

Stock ownership is not required to permit

q

The Commission went further than that, did they

not, in its decision?
ME, KhB.Fii

In this case, Your Honor?

It simply

hold that the Southern Pacific and Milwaukee should not be
included as equal owners together with the Burlington northern
and fell© Union Pacific.
q

Only the stock ownership is involved?

ME. KAHN:

Thar® is not th© slightest suggestion in this case
that these terminal companies perform any less effectively for

for their owners•

and this comes about because th© trunkline

railroads serving Portland, in cooperation with the terminal
railroad, has entered into what vm term-a reciprocal switching

For its

Vv’ -L2., (Ms .s fcx'Sfis.U’r occurs at ttm so-called Albina Yard.
And th© cars, as they ar© turned om* by the Southern Pacific

to the Union Pacific, include cars destined for other points,
other industries on the Union Pacific line, they #,r© mingled
in th® transfer trains with ether Union Pacific cars.

Th©

trainmen proceed to effect the deliveries to th® various
Inbrsnricjs along th© line and goes to th© Canton Yard and
evv;ntm'.Uy deny wind up at Peninsula.
Kc-;y, at such time as the Southern Pacific tenders

28
stiff.Ud©ri traffic to justify it, the. Union Pacific is perfectly
a :

more rapidly.
Finc.lly, X submit, Mr. Justice Blackmun, there simply
wv.s n. c:-::apl-nint by cay shipper on the Peninsula of the service
currently being received.
I started to say that the Peninsula, in its dealings
with the trunkline railroads reaching Portland, will be no
different following the ownership by the Burlington Northern
and tte Union Pacific than obtains presently on the Portland
Tracking Company ©r the Portland Terminal Company.

And the

Southern. Pacific and the Milwaukee, no less than the Burlington
Northern and the Union Pacific, will be able to publish singleij.n?; .• y.v-c-3 to end from Portland, and under such rates render

I

v

r

As I hop© to develop

Pacific has participated to the extant off

20 percent of all Peninsula's traffic.
I think that the appellant railroads misconceived
what ar© the rights and the opportunities afforded the Union
Pacific and the Burlington Northern as a result of their
ownership of the Peninsula Terminal Company.

And the simport

of tbr public bodies I think is equally incorrectly premised.
First, they contend that as owners of the Peninsula,
Burlington Northern and Union Pacific will b© able to oparate

2D

their trains on the Peninsula tracks, thereby avoiding a timeconsv ■" i:,-■] inter change and a switch of equipment*

Section 5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, and protestants
will have an opportunity to be heard at that time.
Q

Apparently the Department of Justice disagrees

with you on that.

Secondly,

They 5d have

•PR, KAHN:

NOf

conceivably, even in. the absence of

30
Q

Then, are you saying that , stock ownership

MR. KAHNs
Q

They file for those in a separate ICC proceeding.

MR. KAHNs
Q

Yes, sir.

Under Section 5(2), or whatever It is.

MR. KAHNs
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

Right.

Even though they do solely own.

MR. KAHNs That is correct, sir.
Q

They don’t give trackage rights, because it's

a separate corporation.
MR. KAHNz
Q

Yes, sir.

Is that it?

MR. KAHNs That is it exactly.
Although Burlington Northern and Union Pacific
jointly own Peninsula, they will not be able to operate on
the* Peninsula track, because they will not have gotten trackage
rights.

MR. KAHNs

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

They would,

nothing.

Then they would appear to bo exercised over

31
MR. KAHN:
Q

I’m afraid so.

Yes, but if the Union Pacific and the Burlington

Northern applied for trackage rights, it may be that Peninsula
isn't going to oppose it very much.
MR. KAHNs

Well, I suspect that's right,and —

I suspect it's right, tooj end yet if the
Ki.7.-.?arkt3 appli:v for trackage rights, it may well be that
Peninsula will oppose it.
MR. KAHN %
Q

Right.

And I think the —

Wall, isn't that a rather major difference?

MR. KAHNs

I think the record shows, Mr. Justice

Whit®, tli at ~~
Q

It may be — it may not bs much in the light of

Condition 24.
MR. KAHN:
Q

Condition 24 —

I mean, isn't that Intended to get Milwaukee

into this port fully?
MR* KAHNs

Milwaukee is there.

Sts trains run daily

into Portland.
Q

I know, but if it were cut out — if it ware

' -..f

rights over Peninsula tracks equal to that of the
'•

r i

X

rr io; vsr a'id the Union Pacific, wouldn't that b©

riti.c-Aiable und-ar Condition 24?
MR. KAHN:

Very possibly.

In fact, if that circum­

stent -a over arose, the Commission would be receptive to reopening

t

32
tha Northern Linas case,

It expressed & reserve in that in

this report; in the report and, order,
X started to say that a second advantage that th®
appellants claim, end that the Burlington Northern and Union
Pacific will have through their ownership of Peninsula, is that
somehow Peninsula will accord them more favorable rates and
mors favorable divisions.
But I think,as Mr. Justice Whit®, I believe it was,
point*:1 cut, Peninsula will remain a separate railroad; it is
•••u'. joct

all fch© provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act,

and fchs Commission has many times held ■— and we discuss that
fully at paga 23 of our brief — that a terminal railroad
simply cannot, under Section 3(4) of the Interstate Commerce
Acte assess on® connecting carrier a higher charge than another
for like

services.
Finally, with respect to the suggestion that

somehow Burlington Northern and Union Pacific, as owners of
the Peninsula railroad, will be able to more favorably allocate
traffic, I beg to invite the Court's attention to the fact that,
in connection with attached conditions, conditions which require
K" past policy of neutrality in the allocation of traffic#
t g-r.

'■

morality tc which the n©v7 owners have committed

fchemselvo:>, must b© observed.
xi.y.-:o conditions are ©nforcible, and, if need be, they
can be strengthened by the Commission.

33

Q

'it this is the law of the situation, th© legal

posture of these parties, why do they need any agreement about
neutrality?
If the statute requires that it give the «am© service
to strangers as to their corporate parents,
MR. KAHNs
Chief Justice.
Q

This was just to pin it down further, Mr.

Just to —
But that did not satisfy your friends.

MR, KAHNs

1 doubt very much that they ar© that much

about the allocation of traffic,
this

I think ultimately

/ " Ox-up to th® pries at which th© Milwaukee gets on to

ft-3 tojitn;;-ula,

This, as we see it, is the essence of the case.
As it pays th© switching charge®?

Q

MR. KAHNs

it pays th© switching — it doesn't pay

© ©-witching charge to reach the interchange tracks? that work
is being done for the Milwaukee by th® Burlington Northern under
contractual arrangement that they entered into, it's a so-called,
joint facility contract charge, considerably less than the

switch charge.

And of course, as Mr. Tatum has indicated, the

Southern Pacific and the Union Pacific had agreed — have

MR. KAHN :

MS. KAHN 2

The share going to Peninsula, approximately

$30 por car, is identical.

For everybody?

MR. KAHN:

Everyone.

Then the Commission’s answer is it doesn’t cost

them a penny more than it costs other lines?
MR. KAHNj
Q

Yes, sir.

Well, of course there is an interest.

Is the

Peni-.sula going to be a profitable railroad?
HE. KAHN:

I — fehar®*8 no —

And I suppose

r-vw&«;JwruXd have :~n interest in sharing those profits.
That r.v:y not have much to cl© with serving this Rivergate area,
but it certainly would foe an advantage.
MR. KAHNi

I don’t think the case was postured

before the Commission, nor is it being presented to this Court,
in terms of deriving an ownership profit from the railroad.
Q

Well,

MR. KAHN:

—

I think the real concern is in whether

Milwaukee and the Southern Pacific can reach the Peninsula

35
Indus'tries and hopefully the-

Rivergate upon equal

competitive terras.
Q

Well,, wh&t

i-ms

the basic approach here?

Kor I mean the purchase ©f the Peninsula by

the two railroads.

Now, is the Commission's approach that, well,

v/© have to approve that unless there is something illegal about
it?
MR. KAHN:
Q
i: '

No, sir.

Well, what would be contrary to the public
letting the Milwaukee have a share?

MR, KAHN %

Oh,

tete w-is the reason the Commission decided

ag airc fc the Mi lwaukee?
MR, kahn*

Th© articulated reason of the Commission,

in the report of th© Commission beginning, 1 think at about
page 31, was to tli© effect that Peninsula and the Union Pacific
and Burlington Northern had developed this ©area and they should
not b© deprived of the fruits ©f their labors, if yon will*
Q

You mean the profits?

MR. KAHNs

Yea, sir

36

Q

Well* that's — profits from what?

MR. KAHN s

Profits from the operations of the

Peninsula.
But certainly in —
2

x Gathered9 though* that you were purely coming

i:c iosiuse there weren’t going to be any profits from the

It’s a sloppy railroad that can’t carry

any traffic anyway.
MR. KMN i

I would not have invested in it —

[laughing] — but the Onion Pacific and Burlington Northern

felt they should.
Q

Surely they must have had. a reason.

the profit® they might realise?

Was it only

Is that the only reason they

want to invest in it?
MR. KAHN*

That, and ©f course* in the ©vent, that the

MR. KAHN:

Q
Rlvergate

And get control of another possible entry into

37
MR. KAHN %

But th© selection of the two other alterna­

tives would be beyond their control.
Q

Well, that may b© true, but this is still a

third entry that they could decide whether or not to spend the
money to make Peninsula an effective entryway ©r gateway into
Rivorgate?

MR. KAHN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, now, why shouldn’t ..Milwaukee have a share
in that decision-making?
Q

Or, to put it another way, why is it in the

public interest to keep the monopoly just in th© ‘hands of two
connecting carriers?
MR. KAHN;

The response of the Commission was that

the close-working relationship between Peninsula and th©
Burlington Northern and Union Pacific, extending back to the
turn of th® century , entitles these carriers in th© area to
the prsia&nt and potential traffic so long as the Milwaukee and

:i Pacific were not disadvantaged in their competing
: • 1

'• traffic; in and out of the Peninsula industries or the

Eiverg:

fee Industrial District»
Q

Yes, but as Mr. Justice Douglas suggested, the

in whether it’s in the public interest, not whether

fchoy’ra entitled to something so long as others are not
disadvantaged.
MR. KAHN:

Right.

Th© Commission viewed it in terms

38
of the National Transportation Policy and assuring that
Peninsula and th® railroads connecting vjith it will remain
viable industries — railroads.
Q

Beg your pardon*

Wall# th© details of the Northern Lines Merger

are certainly not in the front of my mind right new? but
Milwaukee of course# as I recall it# was very much concerned
about a great many factors# including things just like this.
Ana their opposition was# finally# as I recall#drawn away by

a conditions# including particularly Condition 24.
Isn't this generally within th© reach of the kind of
■

Th® promise the Northern Lines case mad©

to th© Milwaukee# mad© to this Court# we submit# has been kept.
&s*.d Milwaukee is in Portland, it is in Portland as an effectiva

MR. KAHN:

Y©s, Your Honor.

X was going to say that the Lake Calumet Harbor case ,
Itr. ?urr.

er•

you z,n the Illinois Central vs. Norfolk £ Wes tarn

case, 335 O.S. 57, is distinguishable in that there, as tills
Court noted, one trunkline railroad actually operated into
the port area under consideration.

And all other trunkline

railroads seeking to serve that port had to depend on the
facilities of that one railroad.
That situation does not here obtain.
The Burlington Northern and the Union Pacific will
not ©par&fc© on the tracks of the Peninsula and their cars,
just as the cars of the Milwaukee and the Southern Pacific,
will r

V

• to be interchanged and switched to the Peninsula,
vi--■:;ifca:o

efforts of the four railroads each will

stand Cv.i m equal footing.
The S cithern Pacific, as I indicated earlier, hereto­
fore has participated in 20 percent of the traffic to and from

m
Pemrwwv,.

ee:i

with the disadvantage of its lines terminating

five, six miles from Peninsula, at East Portland, and its
being dependent on intervening moveraant by the Union Pacific
or the Burlington Northern to reach the Peninsula industries»
I think the hard facts of this case show that wo
have a little railroad with light traffic and little prospect for great expansion.
And the Commission, on balance, determined that there
simply ware not sufficient advantages in four-part ownership
to b-$ able to find that the inclusion of the Milwaukee and the
Sc.tv--'

Pacific would b® consistent with the public interest.

to operate, and of course that was part of the application, it
had decided disadvantages of congestion and disruption of the

MR. TATUMi

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it pl©as® the

Courts
I will just very briefly answer a few comments.
I refer fch® Court, in the length of time w© have
allotted, to our brief and the Justice Department brief,
which points out what the Commission did and did not find as
contrasted to what the Commission now argues before this Court.
They mads no findings similar to what is being argued
her© today, and 1 commend our briefs to you on that point.
counsel ht.s made much in his brief and much in his

i fn-- of r--.stt.3rs that are entirely outside the record in this

H© spends & great deal of time, in his brief and in
his argument, ©n the reciprocal switching arrangement» which was
not entered into at all before this case was decided and on its
way up here.

So how can the Commission have taken into account

the reciprocal switching arrangement, when it wasn’t even

entered into?
I am also advised by counsel for Milwaukee that my
::;i,fcot tist X nv

■"•0

on Peninsula insisting upon a division of

rslos: is alsolutely accurate.

And it. has had a great deal of

42
•'ifniculty in publishing fchoso r&fcaa upon its entry to Portland.
That is outside the record.
But v/o hava bs»an arguing outside the record*, as

Any reason why they didn’t, write an opinion?

MR. TATUM:

Did anyone ask the three-judge court, after

they cmm down with that order for rehearing, for an opinion?
MR. TATUM:

No, sir.

I practice before that court, Your Honor.
