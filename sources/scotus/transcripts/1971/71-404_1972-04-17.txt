MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

Mr. Goldman, you may proceed whenever you're ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALVIN L. GOLDMANf ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GOLDMAN;

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts
The appellant in this case, Lewis Colten* was
convineted under the Kentucky Disorderly Conduct Statute,
Kentuekcy Revised Statutes 437.016.

He was convicted under

provision (£} of that statute, which can be found on page 2
<

of the brief.
The provision under which he was convicted would
read as follows;

"A person is guilty of disorderly conduct

if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or
alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he;
“Congregates with other persons.in a public piece
and refuses to comply with a lawful order of the police to
disperse.”
Two issues are presented in this case with respect
to that provision.

One, whether the Kentucky Court of Appeals'

construction of that provision has rendered it unconstitutional
under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The other, whether the

application of that statute to the facts in this case is

4
unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.

\

The proceeding under which Hr. Colten was cdnvictefi,
under which he was convicted,,in the judgment from which this
appeal is being taken, involves a two-step trial procedure.
Xn Kentucky, misdemeanors carrying potential penalty of up
to 12 months imprisonment, and up to $500 line, can be tried
in an inferior criminal court, as was Mr. Colten tried in an
inferior criminal court in this situation, the Quarterly Court
of Fayette County.
The only way an appeal can be taken from that
inferior court is by filing for a trial de novo in the court of
general jurisdiction, the Circuit Court.

' .

This is what Mr. Colten did in order to bring his
constitutional challenges? when he was convicted in the ini' rior
court.
When he was tried the second time, he was again
convicted, but this time the penalty imposed upon him was
increased.

That aspect of the act raises the third issue

presented before this Court.
Q

Mow? what was the increase?

MR. GOLDMAN:
in

In his case it was a five-fold increase

a’ monetary penalty, an increase from a $10 fine to a $50

fine.

Another case pending before this Court on a petition

for certiorari, the case is Sell vs. Commonwealth, Mo. 70-5304,
involves a much more dramatic increase in penalty.

5
In that case, the man had been fined in Quarterly
Court one dollar plus costs, costs being a statutory require­
ment in Kentucky.

When he was retried in the Circuit Court,

ha received a penalty of a $500 fine and five months and 28
days imprisonment.

That case also was brought tinder this

Disorderly Conduct Statute.
Q

Mr. Goldman# it may be of no significance;

are

the inferior court magistrates lawyers or laymen in Kentucky?
MR. GOLDMAN;

In the particular court in which Mr.

Colten and Mr. Bell were tried, the Court Commissioner is
lawyer.

The situation with respect to the Quarterly Courts

is that they are adjuncts of the County Court.

The County

Court is, for the most part, an administrative position.
The County Judge is, in essence, the county administrator in
Kentucky«
The vast majority of County Judges in Kentucky are
not lawyers.

In the case of Payette County, he happens to be

a lawyer? and in the case of Fayette County, the Quarterly
Court Commissioner, who is appointed, is a lawyer.

It is my

understanding, though, that frequently the County Judges who
are not lawyers try these cases themselves, and that where
Commissioners are appointed, sometimes they are not lawyers.
Q

Is Fayette County where Lexington is?

MR. GOLDMAN;
Laxington is situated.

t

Fayette. County is the county in which

Q

Are transcripts, kept of these lower court trials?

MR, GOLDMAN:

\

for transcript.

S?o, they are not.

There is no provision

My conversations on that matter with the

prosecuting attorney in Payette County is that the defendant
can secure a transcript by bringing his own court reporter,
and then it's a matter of the court reporter’s certification
being acceptable to any court which is later to review the
matter.
I would point out on that account that the appeal
from the Quarterly Court is automatic

strike chat

not automatic, but is a matter of right.

■

Or.

One does not have to

apply for permission to appeal? one does not have to show
grounds for appeal.

One can appeal as a matter of right.

And I think that probably the reason for the rule
being that way is a recognition that the nature of the Quarterly
Court proceeding is such, the nature of the structure of the
Quarterly Court is such that it is readily presumed that
errors can and are frequently committed with respect to
constitutional rights and even statutory rights? and, indeed,
in the opinion of the Court of Appeals below, the court
recognised specifically that the nature of these inferior
court trials are such that all of the constitutional rights
of a defendant are normally not protected.
0

Mr. Goldman, I gather from either the respondent’

contention or yours that one can even plead guilty in the

7
Quarterly Court, and then appeal to the court of general
jurisdiction on a trial de novo; is that correct?
MR, GOLDMAN; That is correct, Mr. Justice Eehnquisfc,
The rule, the rule of the court does permit that.
I would point out, though, that to say to a defendant,
"all you have to do is plead guilty” is to say to a defendant,
"all you have to do is waive your Fifth Amendment rights,"
That there are decisions from this Court, I believe, with
respect to the plea bargaining cases, suggesting that it is
not proper for a court to accept a plea of guilty unless
the court is satisfied that indeed the defendant

'

and admitting his guilt, that where the defendant feels that
he is not guilty, it is improper for a court to i mpose any
form of pressure on the defendant to come before a court and
falsely swear, falsely say in open court, "1 am guilty."
Q

But in this case, your client did not plead

guilty in the Quarterly Court, did ha?
MR. GOLDMAN:

He pleaded not guilty.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Ho, Your Honor, he did not,

He had a lawyer.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, he was a

Locally, there in Lexington?

MR. GOLDMAN:

Locally, at the University of Kentucky.

And counsel was provided for him, voluntary counsel through the
American Civil Liberties Union.
Q

Did the same witnesses testify at both trials?

But there was one witness,

telling me — that appeared at the Quarterly Court that did

The police officer who testified at the Quarterly-

Court who did not testify at the Circuit Court.

We did not

choose to call that witness in the Circuit Court.
Q

How long did it take you to try the case in the

Circuit Court?
MR. GOLDMANs The equivalent of approximately one day.

How long did it take in Quarterly Court?

I don't think I can answer that

Quarterly Court trials.

I have sat in on many

I was present at the trial of Mr.

Bell's case in Quarterly Court, the matter that's on petition
of certiorari.

That case took all■ of about ten. minutes.

Most trials in Quarterly Court run somewhere between 10 and 20

minutes»

Can you get a jury in Quarterly Court?

You can.

The Kentucky Constitution

jur/. The jurj; is yrii hr rho ferire

It’s my understanding that in criminal proceedings,

therefore, where the defendant is found guilty, the jury costs
are appended to the other costs charged to him.

And, for that

reason, it’s my understanding, that when one seeks a jury
trial in the Quarterly Court, that person has to p«;st a bond
or some other form of security for the payment of the jury fee
which works out to be, X believe thirty dollars,

No, Your Honor, he did not ask for a

And the reason for that is that ray client is a

young man, who at that time had quite long hair, a rather
long moustache, and as the trial judge in the Circuit Court
remarked, in words or effect,

"he dresses in the sort of way

that's different from the general way .in which we are used to
seeing people dressed."
The nature of the typical juror's attitude:.in
Fayette County is such that counsel felt that we could get a
fairer trial from the court in this situation than from a jury

And he didn’t ask for a jury trial in the court,

10

ME. GOLDMAN;

No.

I might point out that the way

t he procedure is set up, when you go to Quarterly Court you
have to affirmatively request a jwry trial? in Circuit Court,
the jury trial is the npna:,

and one specifically waives.

In fact, there are a number of situations,

iding the

case, this companion case, in which the Court will reject the
waiver of jury trial *

Bell was tried by just the judge in

Quarterly Court? he was tried by a jury because the court and
prosecutor both insisted on a jury trial when it came for the
trial de novo.
Q

Did the Ball case arise from this — from

events occurring on the same day of Mrs. Nixon's .visit to —
MB. GOLDMANs

No, Mr. Justice Stewart, the Ball case

arose about SO days later, as a result — in relation to a
campus demonstration connected with the Cambodian incidents»
And —

It was at the University of Kentucky.

Bell was arrested when, a curfew
And a group approached the State

Police and said they wanted to go on their campus.

And, in

effect, submitted themselves to arrest as a form of protest
against what they thought to be, what they contend in court to

11
be an unlawfult.ly imposed curfew.
Q

Well, we needn’t go further into the Bell case.

In any event, it didn’t arise from anything related to these
events, on the occasion of
MR. GOLDMAN;
Q

— Mrs. Nixon’s visit?

MR. GOLDMAN;
Q

Ho, it did not.

x see o

MR. GOLDMAN;
Q

No, it did not.

Nov?, —

Mr. Goldman, in Kentucky, may a jury in the

Circuit Court determine the sentence as well as guilt?
MR. GOLDMAN; The jury does determine the sentence as
well as guilt in Kentucky.
Q

Within the statutory limits?

MR. GOLDMAN;

Within the statutory limits.

The only

control that the court has on the sentence,, when there’s a
jury trial, is through the probationary proceeding.
In the Bell case, because the matter is still being
litigated, the court has not reached the point of having the
probationary :iIssue addressed to it.

The facts out of which, surrounding the arrest of Mr.
Colten are, I think, of some considerable significance.

In

the background we have initially a meeting of Mr. Colten and
the officer who eventually took him into custody, Trooper
Harlows.

At the airport terminal area, shortly before Mrs

Nixon's plane departed
At that time Officer HafIowa'testified that Mr» Colten
came tip to him sand said to him, s,We* re going to have a party
out here»'1

And Officer Harlow

in effe

©fc over

here you6re not."

He said they then went off and conducted, a scene
somewhere nearby.
In this connection, he testified on cross-examination
to the effect that he was offended by Mr. Colten5s appearance,
that, in substance, words of substance', he testified to the
effect that he "thinks it's quite improper for a group of
people looking like Colten looks to be hanging around an
airport entrance where", in his words, "an awfully lot of
important people are going in and out.
He did not make any arrest at that time.
Shortly thereafter, a group, the'group that was at
the airport, was departing along the access road *

One of those

departing was driving an automobile with an oufc-of-State
license plats that had expired.

Trooper Miller pulled the car

that was driving with the out-of-state license off to the
3Me of the road, pulled completely off to the side of the
access road.

Trooper Miller pulled in behind that ear, and

Mr. Colten, who knew the driver of the car that was pulled
over, pulled over behind the Trooper's car.
1H« got out of the car.

He learned that the car that

13
had been pulled over was to be towed away»
of five passengers in that car»

There were a total

Mr» Colten had some room in

his own automobile, and at least one of the police officers
confirmed the testimony of the defense witnesses that Mr,
Colten said* when told to leave by police officers, that he
wanted to give a ride back to Lexington to these people»
The officer who apprehended Mr. Colten admitted that
Mr. Colten indeed may have said that.
In any event, some other cars pulled over to the side,
and there was a number of people, variously estimated from
about 12 to 18, throughout the area where the cars were pulled
over.

One officer testified that there was, at one point at

least, 15 persons in the access road.
The captain who was in charge of the detail out at
the airport pulled up in the access road, blocking that road,
got out of his vehicle, and told these people to leave:

"(Set

in your cars and leave".
Other police officers stopped and similarly qot
out of their cars, went over to the crowd and said, "heave;
get in your cars and leave.
Q

You have no business here."

Does the evidence show that, except for the

police officers, most of the members of the crowd or group were
the same people that had the whooping and hollering party out
the airport?
MR. GOLDMAN:

No.

The evidence only shows that they

14
were people who ware out at the airport.

One of the

individuals who testified for the defense, for example, had
not known Mr, Colten until he accepted an offer of a ride in
Mr. Colten*s ear, riding hack to Lexington„
So it would appear that at

least some of the people

who pulled off to the side, who were there at the side, had
nothing to do with -Q

It was not a regathering of t he same group?

MS. GOLDMAN:

No, it was not, Your Honor.

There is

~

at least the record does not indicate clearly one way or the
other if anything in the ~~
Q

How about Mr. Mendez?

Had he been a member of

the group?
MR. GOLDMAN:

Itss not clear in the record,

Mr.

Mendes and Mr. Colten knew each other, but where Mr. Mendes
was is not revealed in the record.
Q

They just knew each other.

MR. GOLDMAN:

Now, at a point at which Mr. Colten

was clearly off of the road, on the shoulder, Officer Harlowe
came up to Mr. Colten and told him to leave.

Colten, according

to Officer Harlowe, said, !!1 want to stay around and see what
happens."
On the constitutional issues', I think we5 re perfectly
willing to argue the case strictly in terms of Mr. Colten having
said nothing more than "I want to stand around and sea what8s

happening.55
Officer Harlows

teld Mr. Colfcen to leave several

times, and then grabbed Mr. Colten and started to lead him
toward the road.
At that point a group of other police officers car
over • any. the record is fairly clear that Mr.. Col ten was at
that point roughed up.
I point that out, not in any effort to win any
mpathy for Mr. Colton,* after all, if he has any course
complaint about that, he has a civil action.

But X think it

is of significance in this case, because one of our contentions
is that the interpretative gloss placed upon the statute by
the Kentucky Court of Appeals renders it excessively
vague and overbroad.
And this Court has frequently pointed out that one
of the deficiencies, constitutional deficiencies of penal
statutes, which are excessively broad and oyer-vague [sic],
is that they provide an invitation to abusa
authorities.

by law enforcement

And I think there is good evidence to suggest

that in fact that is what happened here? that when we look
at the situation realistically, what we have here is a group
of people who cause these police officers to have a loner, hard
day of duty.
This was a group that, as the record showed, had been
following Mrs. Nixon around.

They were clearly not sympathetic

16

to Mrs. Nixon's presence.

/The police officers had just

finished a long , hard day of duty.

There is soma indie

ion

in the record, the trial court gave some recognition that these
police officers may not have felt too kindly to these
individuals.
Q

Who had been following Mrs. Nixon around?

The

police officers or ~MR. GOLDMAN: Well, both the police officers and these
individuals who had been out at the airport.
Mrs. Nixon had a tour of the Lexington area, and this
group had been going from place to place demonstrating in favor
of their — a gubernatorial candidate.

The oabernetorial

candidate being, in effect, a protest candidate; and they
explained that the reason they were demonstrating for the
gubernatorial candidate was to overtly ignore Mrs. Nixon's
presence»
Now, the police officers, after this long, hard day,
are confronted with a situation in which a fellow officer is
issuing a citation, a group of these people are standing
around, and they come over and do what, 1 think our experience
tells us, is a normal police practice.

That doesn't

necessarily mean it's a constitutionally valid police practice.
They come up to the crowd.

They don't say, “Get

off the road"; they don’t say, "Give the officer some clear­
ance”.

The particular officer who was issuing the citation

did not complain about Mr. Colten to the captain, who came over
to him to ask what was going on? he did not seek to arrest Mr,
Colten, he did not ask anyone to arrest Mr» Colten.

He, in

fact, issued his citation without any serious problem.
Q

Well, X thought he had to go back into Mendes’s

car in order to do it?
ixat. GOLDMAN:

he testified that he rent back to his

own patrol car, closed the window and proceeded to issue the
cifcation.
Q

I get it.

MR, GOLDMAN:

There was some suggestion made by him

that he had to do this because of Mr. Colten.

Nevertheless,

when his own captain came to him, after he went to his patrol
car, and asked him what was going on, the captain's testimony
shows nothing, nor does Trooper Miller's testimony show any­
thing to the effect that Trooper Miller said "That man is
interfering with me?'-’I'm have a problem issuing the citation."
The fact is that Mr. Colten was convicted, not for
interfering with the police officer, he was convicted for
failure to disperse upon the, quote, "lawful",, unquote, order
of the police.
So we have a situation in which the police say
"disperse5', and this individual declined to disperse.
thereupon arrested.

He is

X think that in most respects this case

is really very close to recent decisions of this Court in

18

Does the citizen have to jump

Or is the burden upon the police arid the prosecutor
to show that:

No, you were ordered to leave because there was

a compelling need to order you to leave.
In this situation, I' don't think the evidence shows
any such compelling need to leave.
Q

Haven't the courts sometimes said there is a

constitutional right to privacy, the right to be let alone,
the right not to be harassed?
MR. GOLDMAN:

Yes.

When there is such

• . stitution

assembly and expression.

Those rights have to be balanced.

A police officer performing his duties, though, Mr. Chief
Justice, I do not think has a claim to a right of privacy.
Q

I wasn't thinking of the police officer, I was

thinking about what you called overtly ignoring, someone by
following them around all day.

And I think that demonstrati on,

though it was not involved in the facts giving rise to this
arrest, the arrest in no way had to do with the fact that they
were following Mrs.. Nixon.

At least not directly.

That was

not the purported cause justifying the arrest.
But certainly that demonstration is an exercise, 1
think, in." the most important sense of the freedom of expression.
If it please the Court, we would like to reserve
whatever time we have left for rebuttal.

flow, not to let anybody stop on the road; X think this is
normal precautions when you have a dignitary visiting.
And Trooper Miller pulled Mandes's car over solely
because it had expired license plates*
for Colten to stop, but he did.

There was

no cause

He got out of his car, he

proceeded up and asked Trooper Miller why he had stopped the
Mendez car*

Trooper Miller explained to him why he had done

this, that the license plate was expired? then asked him to
please leave as it was none of his concern,.
Colten's reply was:

"Well, 1 want to stay around

And he keep a badgering, in

Trooper Miller’s words, he became obnoxious to the point that
Trooper Miller had to return to his cruiser in order to fill

Captain Mayes was in the next car to stop, the next
police car to stop; he came up and tapped on Trooper Miller’s
car and asked him what the problem was» and did he have these

MR. WILLMOTTs There is disputed testimony.

How many people?

MR. WXLLMOTT:

And they were scattered all over the road?

MR. WXLLMOTT:

The testimony, depending on which side

you look at it, puts them in the roadway or on the right side
of the cars? some of them still in the cars.
Q

But the Captain didn't find any fault with them

until he asked the Lieutenant what was going on?
MS. WILLMOTTs

And the Lieutenant told him, "That man there is

what my trouble is"?

And then he got arrested.

Trooper Brown was the third State Policeman in

And finally Trooper Harlows came up to Colten and
said, "Are you going to leave?"

And then

he grabbed him by the arm and cays, “Not?,

MR. WILLMOTTs

X don’t personally know why he

Did he deny that he slammed him up against the

MR. WILLMOTT;

I don’t think he denied it.

No, Your Honor.

That is, after the arrest.

MR. WXLLMOTTs And I think that in this case we’ve
got to apply the standards of vagueness and ove.rbread.fch to the
actual facts.

Ke*s asked to leave.

Now, the statute, on its face, can be divided into
three parts;

the first part is, Was there an intent to cause

a public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, or recklessly
create a risk thereof?
Now, 1' don't think that there is any great alarm
here, any great annoyance, no tremendous inconvenience.

But

the fact that Mrs. Nixon was at the airport, where we assume
that there was a fairly substantial crowd or well-wishers
wishing Mrs. Nixon a happy trip back, and that they were
leaving the airport at this time.
Now, when you take six cars and pull them off on the
shoulder, and three police cars in the roadway, so that only
one lane is open, you've severely congested the traffic.
Now, the main objective of the police was that they
wanted to break if up.

They weren't trying to arrest anybody.

They weren't looking to bust anybody.

They just wanted to get.

And X think the intent is clear, by Col ten5 s stepping

And other than a road that winds

And in that case the Alabama Supreme Court interpreted the

case, so as to make it constitutional.

Colten was'standing when he was arrested»
HR. WXLLKOTTs

Yes, Your Honor. When he was physically:

placed under arrest, he was on the right side of the cars that
had pulled off the road.

MR. WILLMGTTs

MR. WILLMGTT» By which officer, Your Honor?
He was told by four different officers.

The officer who arrested him for —

At least ten times.

him for disobeying his order to move from what place?
MR. WILLMOTT;

I believe the record will 3how that

Was that on or off the road?

MR. WXLLMOTTs The Mandes vehicle was off the road.
Q

Well, where was he?

MR. WILLKOTT;

Off the road?

He was standing by the right rear

fender of the car. The car was off the road.

Q

So he was off the road?

MR. WILLMOTTs
Q

So ha wasn't blocking traffic?

MR, WILLMOTTs
At that

Yes, Your Honor.

Ho, sir, he was not out in the street

- at the time Trooper Harlowe arrested him.
Q

And he was' arrested for not dispersing?

MR. WILLMOTTs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

When he was convicted, of course, the judge

said specifically he was convicting him for refusing to comply

32
with the lawful order to disperse.
MR. WILLMOTTs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

I take it, under Kentucky law, a refusal to

disperse following

any of those instructions would have

supported a conviction?
MR. WILLMGTT:

I think it would., Your Honor.

In regard to the increase in punishment from the
Fayette Quarterly Court to the Fayette Circuit Court, I think
that the Pearce decision, as set forth in the opinion, applies
to retrials in a case where a man secures a reversal and fchers
were errors committed at the trial? his appeal is from errors.
Now, the spirit of Pearce seems to be that a person
should not be in fear of following an appeal.
"

r

Now, I think
,

that the trial de novo system should not be governed by that.
Because here there are no errors to appeal from, the judgment,

duced at the Quarterly Court ---*
Q

Is there a transcript of proceedings in the

Quarterly Court here?
MR. WXLLMOTT:

Just the transcript above?.

MR. WILLMOTT:

So you don’t know whether the evidence was the

people do that?
MR. WILLMOTT;
Q

No# Your Honor.

That was the fine here, $10?

MR. WILLMOTT:

Ten dollars in the Quarterly Court.

Yes.
There's nothing used in the Circuit Court
Q

May I just ask one more question?

I take it

that the Circuit Court — is that your upper court?
MR. WILLMOTT:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

I take it the Court knew — this was a trial

without a jury, was it?

The Court knew that the sentence

imposed in the Quarterly Court was $10, did they not?
MR. WILLMOTT;

I am sure they did.

Yes.

Mrs.

Wilson, in her closing argument, mentioned the $10 fine in
the lower court.

So whether he knew it from any other source

or not, I am sure he got it from that.
Q

He didn ? t say why he chose to impose a $50

rather' «than a $10 fine, did he?

guilty and say, "Your Honor, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do

The Circuit Court would hava been

Constitution and statute.

The majority of the lower courts are adjuncts of the county

In Lexington, we are fortunate enough to have a judge

But they just merely provide an outlet for speedy

And yet some States do so provide, provide that

start out at parity.

That you're hamstringing the prosecution

if there is a very low fine, or a suspended sentence, or e’,

The prosecutor is not going to want to try

a case where even a jury cannot impose any punishment.

And

this is either going to force the Quarterly Court out of
existence,

except to hear maybe guilty pleas, or it's going to

result in the Quarterly Court handing down maximum sentences.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Willmott suggested that if the Pearce

doctrine is extended to petty cases ox- is construed as applying
to petty cases that it will have a tendency to have these

So that he was not causing the blockage.

The blockage was caused by a police patrol car which could
