MR« CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 70-22 3 f Central Hardware Company against the Labor
Board .
Mr» Mattern? yon may proceed whenever yon9re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP KEITH E. MATTERN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MATTERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
We are reserving ten minutes of cur forty minutes
for rebuttal in this case.
This case involves Central Hardware, the petitioner,
barring a union organiser from a single retail store's parking
lot in Indianapolis back in 1968.
The National Labor Relations Board found a Section 8,
unfair labor practice, violation for this act.

We appealed

that violation to the Eighth Circuit on the basis that bacau.se
the employees were reasonably accessible to the union
organisers in many places other than the store's parking lot,
that this Court's rule of National Labor Relations Board vs,
Babcock s Wilcox controlled and therefore the Board’s decision
should have been reversed.
However, the Eighth Circuit found that because
Central had opened its parking lots to the public, that these
lots had become quasi-public in nature, and consequently this

Court's rule in Logan Valley applied.
We feel that the question before this Court is
basically?

in the situation involving a union organiser

coming on a single retail store’s parking lot, do the rules
of Bafoc6ck a Wilcox apply, or do the rules of Logan Valley

apply?

Especially in this situation where the organizer

comes on. that lot not to -— not to picket or do anything
except solicit a“crchorization cards.
We feel there are two main issues in this case.
The first issue is;

were these employees accessible to those

union organizers some place else in Indianapolis besides our
parking lots?
And I'll discuss that and how it applies to the
Babcock situation.
We feel the second aspect of this case is;

are our

parking lots quasi-public in nature'so that they have the
rightf ruder Logan Valley, to come on those lots?
Mr. Aylward, my co-counsel, will discuss the quasipublic aspect and why Logan Valley in this case does not apply.
Now, as you can probably see from the briefs, the
facts are highly disputed as far as the briefs go.

But it's

our position that these facts are crystal-clear as far as this
record goes.

The facts that are in there.

We feel that not only the physical characteristics
of these parking lots are critical in this case, but we feel

that the actual facts involving the union organizers;' activity *
both on the lots and their lack of activities away from the
lots are very important.
There are two stores in Indianapolis,

There’s one

on the east side of town and one on the west side of town;
both on 38th Street,
on a five-acre tract.

The store on the .east side of town is
It’s a store that sits on the back

side of the tract, with all the parking lot out front.

It faces

on a main street here? a side street over here.
On one side of the East Store’s parking lot there's
a car wash that has a six-foot cyclone fence around it.

On

the other side of the East Store’s parking lot there is what
the trial examiner refers to as a truck service station, which
is separated from the East Store's parking lot by a wide muddy
;'r

strip —- we would like to refer to it as a ditch.
So, as you view the East Store parking lot, it's
not possible to go from any other parking lot onto Central's
lot or to go from Central's lot onto any other parking lot,
except there is a one-man construction office down the access
road.
Across town is the West Store,

Now, the West Store

looks almost exactly like the East Store; again it’s on about
a five-acre tract, it sits on the back part of the parking
lot so that all the parking is out front.

Again there’s a busy

street way out in front, and way over at the far end of that

6
parking lot there5z a McDonald's hamburger stand.

Off to the

right there are two small commercial buildings that have their
own parking lot between them.

The re are three or four small

business in there that are generally, we describe as low-volume
— not low-volume, but they don't pull many customers or
clients.,

It's such things as a small loan company and a carpet

shop» things of that nature.
0

Doss McDonald’s have its own parking lot?

MR. MATTERN:
Q

Yes, sir..

Is there a fence between McDonald’s parking lot

and yours?
MR. MATTERNi

No, sir.

There is a curb, but there

is access between the two.
Q

But you wouldn't call McDonald's a low-access

place, would you?
MR. MATTERN:

There is no testimony in the record.

Your Honor, but I would have to say I would, myself, probably
not refer to it as a low-traffic place.
Q

Is there any sign that says that this parking

lot is restricted to people at this store?
MR. MATTERN:
Q

At either place?

MR. MATTERN:
C

No, sir.

No, sir.

Then the public is free to park there?

MR, MATTERN:

No, sir.

7

Q

Well, what happens if they do park there?

MR. MATTERN: The record is replete with instances
where there have been members of the public who came on the
parking lot, who were not customers, and these people were
uniformly, throughout the entire period of this organisational
campaign, ejected.
Q

There is —

They were union people, weren't they?

MR. MATTERN:

Ho, sir.

There was a man who wanted

to open his own photo-mat; there was somebody wanted to sell
Christmas tress; there was somebody who wanted to have a
petition about a soldier who was bs»ing court-martialed.
Q

Well, I think that a man who wants to set up a

business to sell Christmas trees is not what I was talking
about.

I msan somebody who just parks their automobile

there, period.

Say I'm driving down West 38th Street, and

1 want to go down in there and 1 drive in there and park; it’s
all right?
MR. MATTERS?:

Ho, sir, it's — if you are coming as

a customer, Your Honor, you're more than welcome.
Q

Is there any sign that tells me that?

MR. MATTESNs
Q

No, sir.

So it's not open to the public?

MR. MATTERN:

No, sir.

It's open to our invited

customers.
Q

If you're —

But there's no sign that says that?

KR. MM'TERN;

No, there isn’t.,. Your Honor,

But there is — in this record there is not one instance of
anybody coming on that parking lot who was not a customer, who
was not ejected as soon as he was discovered, union or non­
union»
Now, over at the West Store, even with these two
commercial buildings off to the side,, that have their own
parking lot, the testimony in the record is that there are
never more than five or sis customers in that area at any one
time»
Now, all of the tracts involved in this case, all of
these tracts of ground, the car wash, the McDonald’s, all of
these have been built by different people at different times,
each maintains his own lot, each repairs his own lot? there is
no apparent concert of effort to attract people into this as
a shopping canter.
Now, the organisational campaign itself began on
May 21st, 1968.

Now, this Court’s rule in Babcock states that

the organisers can come on the parking lots only if the
employees are otherwise so inaccessible that reasonable
efforts to communicate with them through the usual channels
of communication prove ineffective.
Now, ”ineffective" in this situation doesn’t mean
that the organizers contact the people some place and just
don’t get the authorization cards signed, it means that it’s

9

ineffective, that they can't even get to them, because of the
location of their homes in relation to the factory or the place
they work.
Now, with the background of Babcock in mind, I'd like
to review how this organizational campaign was actually con­
ducted .
The campaign started on May 21st, 1968, when nine or
ten union organisers descended onto the West Store parking lot
with what the Eighth. Circuit refers to as a blitz campaign.
Now, this campaign was obviously designed to get the maximum
number of authorization cards signed in the shortest period of
time.
There is no evidence in the record in this case that
there was any other form of preparation for this campaign,
other than the union organisers.

However, a month before the

campaign started, the union had gone to a shop steward at The
Kroger Company, or he came to. them, however they got together,
and he took a leave of absence from The Kroger Company and came
to — falsified his job application — came to Central Hardware
and got one of the new jobs at our West Store.
During that whole period of the month he freely
admits that he worked on getting names, addresses, telephone
numbers, and even job descriptions.
Mow, in this record there is no evidence of any other
form of attempt t:> contact those employees.

There is no phone

10
calls? no letters to their homes? no handbilling? no use of
newspapers? they didn’t even invite them down to the union
hall.
Now? I've never heard of an organisational campaign
that didn't involve at least inviting them down to the union
hall or to some other meeting place.

Now? the director of organising? himself? testified
that home calling? that is visiting these people at horns?
is the most effective form of organising.

Yet? even though

57 percent of our employees live within five miles of this
store? 74 percent live within ten miles? the Board presented
not one instance of home calling by a union organiser.
I was the only one who presented any evidence of home
calling.

And the union organizer admitted on cross-examination

that one afternoon he had gone out with a list of 50 or 60
people? two months'

after the campaign started? and even at

that he must have gone like a greyhound to do all this in one
afternoon, but even at that he was able to contact 20 percent,
of the people on that list.
Yet home calling wasn't even used for the first
two months of the campaign* and then only in one instance in
this record.
Now? as we have pointed out in the briefs, as this
campaign progressed on the parking lot? the union's tactics
became progressively so gross that the employees started

II
coming to us, not a few employees, 25, 30, 100, complaining
about the tactics being used out there, the harassment, the
threats?to the extent that we had no choice but to invoke a
no solicitation rule by organisers on this parking loti
It's our position that although Babcock was decided
back in 1956, that it * s still the law now.

In the recant cases

that we’ve cited in the brief, the Board's own Monogram Models
case, Kufcshsr’s Hotel and Tamiment, that involved resorts that
were open to the public, that have just been decided by the
Second and Third Circuits, that the Boards and the Courts of
/

j

Appeal have rigidly been enforcing and utilizing Babcock in
these same situations.
It’s our contention that on this basis that the
Eighth Circuit should be reversed on the basis that Babcock
should have been the applicable rule.
Q

In Babcock, was the parking lot open to the

public?
MR. MATTEPN:

Mo, sir.

I can’t say it wash Your

Honor.
Q

As a matter of fact, you know it wasn’t? if

you read the opinion.

Q

Mr. Mattern, would you complain had the

solicitation been just outside the entrance door as to your
East and West Stores?
MR. MATTERN:

Rather than in the parking lot.
Just outside the doors, Your Honor?

It took place all — it was outside, it was outside the doors,
it was over there and it was over there, and there were nine
or ton of them out there on the same lot.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Aylward.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD L. AYLWARD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THF PETITIONER
MR. AYLWARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, arid may it please

the Court:
It's my pleasure to address this Court this afternoon
and tell the Court that they might just as well disregard '*
everything that my co-counsel just said.

Because, in presenting

■»

the issue before this Court, the Eighth Circuit has stated
that accessibility is really not too important, that really
the Beard and the Eighth Circuit is under a mandate from this
Court, in its Logan Valley decision, to find that our lots,
our free-standing single store lots, are open to the public.

13
Kcw, this, they say, is the crucial issue here5

is

whether or not Logan. Valley applies.
I’d like to direct the Court's attention to the
decision where they say that the basis of their decision is?
"Under the mandate of Logan Plaza, we hold the Company’s” —
Q

What page are you on?

MR. AYLWARD:

On page 84 of the Appendix, Your

Honor.
’Under the mandate of Logan Valley Plaza, we hold the
Company’s non-employee no-solicitation rule to be overly
broad as applied to its parking lot."
Also in the brief of the NLRB before the Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals, quite candidly the Board sayss
to
"It should be noted at the outset to the contrary/the company’s
assertion, neither the trial examiner nor the Board relied on
the difficulty of access to the employees here as affording an
independent basis for the finding that the Company’s rule was
unlawfully broad? rather, the examiner noted that while the
question of whether the employees are otherwise within
reasonable reach by the union has significance, it is not
of paramount importance in this case, in the case of parking
lots, if the parking lot is quasi-public in character.’’
So, again, the NLRB, in its brief in opposition to
our appearance here, they say;

"The only issue here, there­

fore, is whether the Board’s finding that the Company’s

parking lots were open to the public to such an extent to
render the situation similar to that in Logan Valley is
supported by the record.”
Therefore, gentlemen, if we’re able to prove that
accessibility is important, and that there's an alternate
means of communicatinq with these employees, then I think the
Board is going to be hard put to say that they have proved
inaccessibility, and therefore they’re entitled to have their
j udgment a £ f i rme d.
It would be the Board's position, and it is the
Board’s position, that it makes no difference on alternate
means of communication*
ity.

It makes no difference of accessibil

That, as far as discriminatory application of this rule

it really makes no difference, either.
Yes, Your Honor?
Q

Didn't the Board make a finding that there

was no other feasible means?
MR. AYLWARDs

The Board in its — it spent four

pages on analyzing a decision over in the Seventh Circuit,
its own. decision in the Solo- Cup case? and in that case it
relied on the quasi-public aspects of Logan Valley.

It only

gave one four-line conclusion in our case, when they arrived
at the decision, and that was just a general statement that’s
unsupported by anything in the transcript of the record. But
they re saying that --

15
0

But they did —

MR, &YLWARD:

— they held; and we maintain it’s

unsupported by the record, that these employees were
inaccessible.
Now, it0s very important, I think, for this Court to
note that, it's been the long-standing rule in labor relations,
*

going bask to the Republic Aviation case, that certainly
employees themselves in certain -- in this situation, and
even inside the store, when they're on nonworking time, they
have 'a right to communicate with one another to find out what
their rights are as far as whether or not they should join a
union-organizing attempt, et cetera.
Now, as Mr. Matters pointed out, even after our
decision here in the Board case, the Board has gone back again
to the Babcock £ wilcoy case in situations that are open to
the public»

And, Your Honor, the Tamiment ease and the

Rutnher*s Hotel case, those are open to the public, and there
the Board' has come back and said it’s still Babcock and Wilcoss,
and not your Logan Valley.
Q

Are those cases cited in the briefs?

MR. AYLWARDs
Now,

Yes, they are,

ve would maintain that quite frankly if you’re

dealing with coming on private property, you probably have a
lot better right doing it over under Section 1 than you have
over getting into your First Amendment•

%

Because, remember,

16
under Babcock & Wilcox you have that case? you have the case
of a. person that9 s unrelated to that business enterprise
coaling on your lot solely to solicit union membership, and
there, in certain situations where you have the inaccessibility,
you don't have another means of communicating, and in that
case the Board says:

In balancing the rights of the principals

involved, the employer, on his Fifth Amendment, and the
employee on his Section 7 and his First 'Amendment rights,
■

in that situation we're going to balance it and say that the
employer has to give way, and the union organisers have a
right to come on, because these people are inaccessible else­
where,
Q

Well, in fact, Mr. Aylward, didn't the Board

do that in this Footnote 2 on page A20 of the petition?
MR. AYLWARDs

I don't have the petition readily at

hand.
Q

Wellj I'm looking at the Board's opinion.

MR. AYLWARDs Yes, Your Honor.

certainly they should not be relying on your Logan Valley..

Well, if this were presented only as a Babcock

!tes kind of a stretch

What the equation would be, the Court

here relied on Marsh vs. Alabama, and which I think it clearly
should have.

And they said Chickasaw-Mobile suburb was

equivalent to a town.

And where else could you find the

People in the town but on the public sidewalks out in front
of the store?
They then drew that equation to the Logan Valley
situation, and. then they compared all the physical attributes —

MR. AYLWARD:

MR. AYLWARDs Well, I think it’s a —
Q

The union would be there exercising free

speech rights like anybody else.

20

MR.- AYLWARD: Well, I think really it doesn't really
matter what we call it, whether we call it First Amendment
rights or we call it Section 7 rights, I think what you're
going to wind up in both situations is what you wound up in
in Logan Valley, is whether or not those pickets could
reasonably communicate their message elsewhere and to the persons
to whom they were directing it.

And in that case you said,

Wall,, they were directing it to the patrons of Weis Market,
and where else could you find the patrons of Weis Market than
right in front of the marketplace?
And the Court — Justice Marshall went to the extent
then, after he had found that, and said:

Now, let's take

where else could they be? could they go out onto the berms
of the highway and he ably pointed out that holding up the
sign as the cars were going by at 35 miles an hour, certainly
that's not a reasonable alternative means of communication.
So he found the only thing he could find, and that is the proper
place and the only place where that message could be
communicated is right in front of Weis Market.
Now, you take our situation, where you have the
union organizers coming on and soliciting membership in the
union, well, it's ray opinion that we've proven that they don't
have the right to come on our lot because they don't have to.
They have other ways of communicating it.
So, too, as you looked at the berms in Logan Valley,

21
look at the house calls, the meeting halls, the telephone?
the fact that these people had a list of our employees 8ft percent
complete, with names, addresses, telephone numbers, and job
descriptions, found, really, through a paid organizer that we
put on our payroll, that.was getting $X$ft a week, also being
paid by the union during this time.
Q

Did they have that

MR. AYLWAFD:

He went on our payroll specifically

for that purpose.
Q

Did they have that list when they first started?

MR. AYLWARD:
Q

S bag your pardon. Your Honor?

Did they have that list when they first

started?

MR. AYLWAFD;

Yes, Your Honor, I think that these

people, the paid insider was able to get other people to call
in, and 1 think the testimony in the case is that this list
had been built up so that at the time that these stores became
open, they had the list.
Q

My question was, when they first started talking

to the employees in the parking lot, did they have this list?

MR. AYLWAFD: There's no evidence one way or another
in the transcript.
C

Well, how could they have made house calls

without the list?
MR. AYLWAFD: Well, that's the point, because they

22

had to have it.

Their own testimony, brouqht out by Mr. Mattern,

was that they did have the list in order to make the house
calls.
Q

I understood him to say that was way late in

the game.
MB. AYLWARD: Two months later.

There was no

testimony in the record of when the list was — the list was
being formulated over this period of time.
How, if we're going to look at Logan Valley,

let’s

look to see what the Court distinguished in Logan Valley.
How, in Logan Valley, ■you had a large complex of Sears and
IS other stores on a single privately owned tract of land.
Central’s case, we own our own parking lot, and we’re the only
store on that parking lot.
The perimeter of Logan Valley was 1.1 miles.

How,

there is no testimony in the record how many acres this is,
but if we take the Lloyd vs. Tanner case that comes after ours
here, in theirs it was 1.5 mile perimeter, and that was about •
50 acres.

So I would assume that Logan Valley must be about

40 acres.

Ours is approximately five acres, on both lots.
There’s a system of sidewalks in Logan Valley Plaza.

In our case there are no sidewalks.
roadways.

There was a system of

In our case there are no roadways.
The parking lots on Logan Valley are commonly shared

by all the tenants? and I think, as Mr. Mattern pointed out,

23
ours are not commonly shared.
The public was unrestricted on Logan Valley,

There5s

no testimony in there, as far as I can determine, that any one
was excluded from those lots.

And yet replete in our evidence

..is the fact that we have consistently controlled our parking
lots for our customers.
Q

Well, the -—

Mr. AYLWAFD:
Q

Yes, sir?

— the trouble is that the trial examiner found

just the contrary,
MR. AYLWAPD:

Yes, but he found that, Your Honor, in

our contention, not based upon any evidence in the record.
0

Beg pardon?

MR. AYLWARD:

He found that on no evidence in the

record, and that's our contention.

Judge Gibson says that he

also found that we discriminatorily applied this no-solicitation
rule, and Judge Gibson in the Eighth Circuit said that this is
taken from thin air and is devoid of fact.
Mow, the other aspect that was found in Logan Valley,
that I think is extremely important is that that was the
regular shopping center of the community*
Q

Yes.

Was the parking lot here posted or —

MR. AYLWARDr
Q

No, Your Honor.

In fact, in •••*•

Did the public use it generally?

MR. AYLWAFD:

No, I think, as Mr. Matter» says, it

24
was supposed fco be used strictly by our customers and by our
employees.
Q

I'm not saying what is supposed to ba don©, but

whether it was actually in fact?
MR. AYLWARD:

Yes.

The only evidence in the record

is the fact that we did control the lot, that no one came
there --- there is no evidence of anybody else on those parking
lots other than our customers and employees.
Q

Did you put people off if they weren't?

MR. AYLWARD:

Yes.

The record is replete where we

have everyone that's come on there for non-relaied business to
our type of business, a customer, then we've excluded him. Your
Honor.
Now, I think it's very important that the Logan Valley
situation was one where it was classified as the regular
shopping center for the community. Well, certainly our hardware
store parking lot and our hardware store can't be classified
as a regular shopping center of the community, where you have
to go on these lots, otherwise where are you going to find
the people.
The definition, 1 think, in Logan Valley, given so
ably by Justice Marshall, was a suburban shopping center
typically is a cluster of individual retail units on a single
large privately owned tract.
Well, certainly, if Justice Black found difficulty

25
in equating the sidewalk in Marsh vs. Alabama with the regular
shopping center aspects of Logan Val1ey, imagine his difficulty
if he were here today trying to equate Marsh vs» .Alabama with
our single-store parking lot, hardware store.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You're now cowing into

your rebuttal time.
Q

But there are other stores in the center, are

there not?
MR. AYLWARD:

Not on our lot.

don't classify it as a center.

And, Your Honor, we

As Mr. Mattern said, over

in the East Store situation we had a fenced-in car wash.
Certainly if they had a six-foot high fence, then they're not
coming onto our parking lot? it separates it.
The one thing that Mr, Mattern did leave out is:
in addition to the service station on the corner being separated
by this six to eight-foot ditch, there's also a curbline that
we put in there some six to eight inches high, separating them
from it.

So that’s all you have on the. East Store parking

lot entirely.
I think Mr. Mattern also covered the physical
aspects of the West Store.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COMF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. COME;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The prior decision —
Q

If counsel is right in answer to my question,

this is the first case in a long, long time from the Labor
Board where there is no evidence at all to support its
findings»
MR, COME;

I think that counsel is in error, because

the trial examiner,whose findings were adopted by the Board,
found on the basis of the facts in the record, some of which 1
will allude to, that the situation is not exactly as my
colleague has depicted it.
0

As to at least part of it, Judge Gibson in the

Eighth Circuit thought there was an absence of evidence on
some of the crucial points, didn’t he?
MR. COME:

Well, Judge Gibson thought that there was

an absence of evidence to sustain the Board's finding that
there were — that you couldn't reach these people by
alternative channels? that is, to satisfy the Babcock test.
There are really alternative bases for the Board^s
finding in this case.

I think the trial examiner's report

shows that more clearly than the Board's decision does,
because the Board largely just summarily affirmed the trial

27
examiner.

But --«•
Q

Weil, am 1 right that in Footnote, 2 at page 20

is based on a Babcock finding?
ME. €OMF:

That is with respect to one leg of the

holding in the case. There are really two legs.
Q

Well, may I ask this, then, Mr. Coma?

ME. COME:
0

Since you have an enforcement order

ME. COME:
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

— if this is sustainable under Babcock, are

you entitled to affirmance without reference to Logan Valley?
MB. COME:

Yes.

The problem with that is, however,

that the Eighth Circuit didn’t reach the Babcock end of it,
as X read their opinion.

They sustained this under. Logan

Valley grounds.
Q

So that if we agreed with them on the Logan

Valley ground, it ought to go back for them to reconsider it
on the Babcock ground?
MR. COME:

Unless the Court is persuaded that the

facts are so clear, and they are. simple enough, so that a
remand would not be necessary.
Q

Well, in other words, unless we were to settle

it?
MR. COME:
Q

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

Without waiting — well, can we do that under

28

Universal Camara?
MB. COMEs Well, a better practice would probably be
to remand, if you find it necessary.
Q

Well, doesn't Universal earner si actually reouire

us to make a remand?
MR. COME; Well, ordinarily the Court does that.

We

had a case called Insurance Agents, on the independent
contractor issue, where the Court, after finding that the
Seventh Circuit had applied an erroneous standard, proceeded
to evaluate the evidence and enforce the Board's order.
But — so that you don't have to reach the Babcock
access test if we are right on our first premise that the
circumstances here are, in every relevant respect, similar
to those in Logan Valley.

If they are, we submit, you have

an appropriate place for the exercise of the union's
organizational activity, and under principles that go back as
far as•Schneider v. Town of Irvington, the exercise of free
expression on an appropriate place cannot be abridged just
because it could be carried on elsewhere.
So I'c! like to deal with the Logan Valley aspect of
the case —
Q

Before you go on with that, —

MR. COME;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

— how large a parking lot is this?

cars approximately?

How many

Mk„ COME; Right.
Q

How many would you say?

MR. COMEs

Each of the stores is a•supermarket tyoe

structure, which is about 70,000 square feet, situated on a
large expanse of land, the West Store, according to the
evidence in the record, is about five acres.

?fhe store

buildings are located at the rear of the property, and between
the store and the street is a large open parking area, about
350 feet wide and 200 to 375 feet deep, with space for 350
cars.
It also has space in here for the employees to park
in certain sections of this parking area, and each store has
125 employees? and the evidence shows that the overwhelming
majority of them drive to work or car-pool to work.

So you've

got an awful lot of employee cars that are parked on this
parking lot.
The record also shows that the employees, in many
cases, eat their lunches on the parking lot during lunch hour,
and of course they are at the store during their entire working
day.
Wow, the property —«

The property — the record is perfectly clear, on this
— is not enclosed by fences or other physical barriers, nor
are the parking lots marked with signs restricting entry.
The entrances to both lots are on heavily traveled highways
with speed limits of 35 to >10 miles an hour, and the highways
do not have sidewalks.

There are, however, according to the

reco ,d.f grassy islands or berms in front of the entrance —
Q

Well, Mr.Come, —■

MS, COME:

— to the East Store.

— isn’t the whole purpose of your going into

these facts — or is it? — to demonstrate that this:

because

the parking lot is open to the public and because of the facts
about the parking lot, the owner of the parking lot must be
treated as an official?
MR. COME:
Q

No, Your Honor,

I think

Well, you’re going to have to subject him to the

First .amendment; right?
MR. COME:
Q

No, Your Honor,

I think that --

Well, Logan Valley was a First Amendment case,

wasn’t it?
MR. COME:
Q

Logan Valley was a First Amendment case.

Does the First Amendment apply to just any

31
private person?
MR. COMEt

No.

But in the problem under the National

Labor Relations Act# with regard to equating, interpreting
%

Section' 7, which gives employees the right to organize through
their representatives, where that comes into collision with
private property, the decisions of this Court have made it
clear that what you have to do is to balance —

This sounds like —■ this sounds like the other

leg of your argument, the Babcock right.
MR. COME:

No, Your Honor, because I submit that

Babcock makes it clear that this accommodation must be done
with as little dislocation of the one as the other, and that
in making the accommodation the facts of the particular use of
the property make a difference.
Mow, Babcock involved a situation of a parking lot
that was not open to the public.

In terms of Logan Valley and the First Amendment.

Does the First Amendment come into play every time you run into
a public — a parking lot that is so-called open to the public
in front of a retail establishment?
Does that retail' operator subject himself to the
First Amendment?
MR. COME;

I don't think that yon need to reach the

First Amendment problem with respect to the? National Labor
Relations Act.

You might conceivably find that in a parking

I don't think so, Your Honor, because they

sustained the Board’s finding that this was a violation of
Section 7»

The problem is that Babcock didn't, as we read it,

lay down the holding that is to govern every conceivable
property organisational right situation? you did not have a
case of open property»

And the difference, that the openness

of the property makes is that, as we read the Court's opinion
in Logan Valley, we believe it makes this clear is that whan
)

the employer has opened up his property to members of the
public, albeit for the purpose of only patronising the store,
and to
Q

Well, it’s more than that, because the people

who are wotking there are the people who are involved in this

MR. COME?
that I’m coming to.

That is correct, and that’s the point
That to close it to those members of the

public, i.e.', the union and its representatives who had a
message germane to that store, about its labor conditions and
appealing to the employees tc join the union, is to create an

34
invidious discrimination that makes the openness of the
property turn upon whether or not the employer agrees with the
message that this segment of the public is putting upon it.
Q

Well, that’s a very statutory Babcock j& Wilcox

kind of argument, Mr. Come, but is it — I'll just ask you
again s

Is the First Amendment relevant to this case or not?

Are you relying on the First Amendment to any extent or not?
MR. COME:

I am not relying on it directly, Your

Honor, no.
Q

Well, to any extent, I said.

Indirectly... or any

other way?
MR. COME:

picture, in the sense that —

operator is equated to a public body?
MR. COME: Well, it is only in this — to the extent
that the right to self-organisation and the right to have —
Q

Statutory rights.

MR. COME:

The statutory right, going back to Thomas

v._ Collins, it is clear- that this comes not only from Section
1 but it also comes from the First Amendment.
Q

But that's not vis-a-vis the government, that's

vis-a-vis the State; that’s Thomas v. Collins, as my brother
White says.

The First and Fourteenth Amendments don't come

into play unless or until there's governmental action that

suppresses free speech,
Q

Well, there's governmental action here because

somebody has stopped the picketing.

Or has refused to stop

the picketing.
MR. COME? But I think that for purposes of our posi­
tion in this case, I do not have to establish that the right
of the union organisers to get on this property is mandated by
the First Amendment.
Q

But to the extent that you rely on Logan Valley,,

you rely on the First Amendment, do you not?
Do you not?
MR. COME:

Mo,

I*m using the principle that Logan

Valley established for purposes of the First Amendment by
analogy for making a reasonable balance of organisational
rights and property rights for purposes of the National Labor
Relations Act.

This isn’t the first time that this Court has

done that in a Labor Board context.

It did it in Linn v,__ Plant-

Guard Workers, involving the question of defamation in a labor
disputeo
The Court said that although the First Amendment
wasn’t controlling here, nonetheless the principles under the
First Amendment are relevant by way of analogy, and it's only —
Q

Are we to read the Eighth Circuit decision as

resting on the argument that you’re now making to us?

NR, CGhh

That is the way 1 read the Eighth Circuit

36
opinion, Your Honor, but —
Q

Whether I label that Babcock or not, the point

is that your insistence is that just balance is what the Eighth
Circuit did in enforcing the Board’ s order and is entitled
to affirmance on that ground?
MR. COME:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, and I think that »~

We can forget all about the First Amendment in

this case?
MR. COME:

1 think that — that you can do So,

because all we have to establish here is not a violation of
First Amendment but a violation of Section —
0

But, Mr. Come, you’ve got to establish, at

least for me you've got to persuade me; that’s what the Eighth
Circuit did.
MR. COME: Well, I think -- well.

The Eighth Circuit

had before it a Board order which was premised on the ground
that there was an invasion, a violation of Section 8{a)Cl) of
the Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an
employer to restrain or interfere with employees in the exer­
cise of their organisational rights.
The Board found that there was *— in promulgating a
ban which completely prohibited union organizers from using
the parking lot.

The company, in imposing that kind of a

blanket ban, had violated' Section 8{aMX> of the National
Labor Relations Act

Now, in arriving at that conclusion, the Board,and
the trial examiner even more specifically, balanced the
detriment to the employees’ organisational rights from being
deprived from using this parking lot facility as against the
impairment of the employer’s property interests, and it found,
at least on one way of its findings, that since, as in Logan
Valley and unlike in Babcock, these were premises that were
open to the public.

i’he employer had depreciated his

property right, unlike in Babcock, where he had no justifiable
claim to a right of privacy because he had opened up the parking
lot, a parking lot by its nature is full of commotion and
movement, and that there was no shewing that the presence of
the organisers there was disrupting the normal operation of the
employer5 s businesa,
If there were instances of such disruption, the way
to check that is to check the individual instances, not to
completely ban the activity and the company did file a charge
with respect to that conduct with the Board's General Counsel,
who found insufficient evidence to issue — to warrant the
issuance of a complaint on it.

You have a situation then of

property that had been opened up, where the conduct of the
union organisation did not disrupt the normal operation of the
business.
Balancing that against the inconvenience to the union
of being forced to conduct this activity elsewhere, because, as

38
Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out, until they got the names and
home addresses they could not really effectively organize,
and the only way they could get that was by access to the
parking lot?once they were denied access fco that —
Q

Well, they had a spy on the payroll of the

company, dldn't they?
MR. COME;

They had an employee who was also a union

organizer.
Q

Getting full-time pay from the union and

getting full-time pay from the company, and the company didn't
know that he was a union employee.

Now, maybe "spy" is an

overworked word, but they did have an agent, a union, a paid
union agent in the employ of the company?
MR. COME; That is correct.

However, the testimony

of the union organiser, which was credited by the examiner,
was that the bulk of the names and addresses came from contacts
on the parking lot.
Q

Mr. Come, *—

MR. COME;

Q

Yes, sir.

— you said that the parking lot, by its very

nature, was a place of commotion and Movement.
MR. COME;
Q

Yes.

But you also seem to suggest that having nine

or ten union organizers on the parking lot was not an inter­
ference with the owner's use of his private property.

Then

39

yon suggested that you should just stop the individual cases
of interference.

Now, what do you mean?

Hire a couple of

security officers to go out and monitor the business agents
of the union?
MP.„ COME; Well, I suppose that that could be one
way of doing it.
Q

How else would he do it?

If couldn81 — he

wouldn’t —
MR. COME: Well, he could ~~ he could — he could go
to a Stats Court and get, attempt t© gat an injunction if he
found that there was activity there that was interfering with
his operation. The point is that he wasn’t able to make —
Q

Why should he have to do that on a tract of

private property that’s maintained for his customers?
MR. COME: Well, the question is whether or not, by
opening it up to the public he is not narrowing his property
interest to the point where he cannot, at least, impose a
blanket ban —
Q

And you make that — you raise that question

under Logan valley or under Babcock?
I'm still not sure, in your colloquy with Mr.
Justice White and Mr. Justice Brennan, whether you do or do not
rely on the Firef Amendment *

At one time I thought you did,

and than later it seeded, that you had abandoned the First
Amendment

40
MR. COME: Well, I*m relying on Section 7 of the
National Labor Relations Act, becuase I think that that is what
we have in this case.

1 think that whether Logan Valley

would have required this result in a First Amendment, on these
premises, is another question, which you may have to reach in
the next case,
0

i don't think that you have it here.
But, Mr. Come, just to make clear what the

Board's position is with respect to parking lots, X take it
from what the trial examiner said and whatever ha said was
adopted by the -MR. COME:
Q

Board.

■—■ by the Board, he says in Footnote IS on page

23 of the record:

"However, whether or not respondent's

stores are in shopping centers is immaterial, inasmuch as the
>

Board, in Priced-Less Discount Foods, Inc.,, equated a single
store parking lot to a shopping center parking lot."
So the Board's position in this case and others is
that whenever you have a parking lot that is serving a retail
store, even though it’s just a single store, single parking
lot, that this — that the Babcock rule does not apply?
Q

For the purpose of a labor dispute.

Q

Yes,

MR, COME:
Q

Yes, Your Honor,

That is the Board's position?

MR. COME:

At least where —

41
Q

In that parking lot, then you have a different

situation than Babcock?
ME. COME; That is correct.

At least where the

dimensions of the parking lot are such that it creates a sub­
stantial buffer aone between the store and the nearest, closest
public place where you could appeal to the audience that
you’re appealing to.
Q

Yes.

MR* COME;

Well, of course —
Now, 'some of these retail stores in the

downtown part of town may front on a public sidewalk, and the
employees may coma through that —
Q

Right.

MR, COME:

— door; in that case it may be

possible to reach them adequately without the necessity for
getting onto the parking lot.

so.I don’t want to state my

rule boardly —
Q

Yes.

MR, COME;

— that I’m foreclosing what the Board

would do in that kind of a case.
Q

Well, you just simply have a different factor

to put in the balance whan you have a public parking lot than
when you had just isolated parking lots at a plant?
MR. COME; That is correct.
G

And it makes a different balance between

inaccessibility and —

42
MR. COMIS;
Q

Well, it all --

— and burden on the property owner?

MR. COME: That is correct.

And it also raises the

question as to whether you have to really bear down so strongly
on inaccessibility.
Q

That's right.

MR. COME:
Q

Yes, sir.

Well, X suppose no one would object if the

employee crossed the parking lot in order to go to work?
MR, COME;

Ho.

He does that.

He does that.

He

even parks his car on the parking lot.
G

If he comes reverently and obediently and

submissively, .but if he comes in protest than he ean?t do it?
MR, COME: That is it, Your Honor.

I think that

sums it up
G

Are these employees who wore trying to come on

this parking lot, or are they strangers?
MR. COME: Thase are outside organisers.
Q

Yes.

So that the employees crossing that lot

are using the lot for the precise purpose that the employer
put it there, is he not?
MR. COME: The employee is using it to go to work
"N

v

You told us that about, more or less, 100 parking

spaces were set aside by the employer for the use of the
employees»

43
MR. COME: That is correct.

And the question is,

however, that on one leg of the company’s argument here, as
X understand it,

it would have been all right here had the

union put up a picket line that appealed to the consuming
public and urged them not to patronise this store because of
its non-union condition.

This is one of the points that they

say distinguished this case from Logan Valley.
Well, I submit that that just turns upside-down the
priorities in this area, because, first of all, the employees
are no second-class citizens to this store, they have more
substantial contacts with the store than the —
»

Q

Well, if these had been employees, you'd have

Repufol i c Avi at ion, and you wouldn’t even be her©.,
Q

That’s right.

MR. COME:
Q

These are non-employees, are they not?

MR. COME:
either.

Mo. But, in Logan Valley, Your Honor, --

In Logan Valley you didn’t have employees,

You had stranger organisers, and they were on the

parking lot and they were appealing to members of the -public.
Q

And that was a constitutional decision, and it

had to rest upon a finding that the people who suppressed that
demonstration was the equivalent of government, or else it
*

could not have been a constitutional decision?
MR. COME:
Q

No, Your Honor, 1 do not —*

Well, have you«road the First and Fourteenth

44
Amendments hare?
MR. COME:
Q

Yes, and 1 know that that requires State

Well, so far as Section ? goes, • it wouldn’t

make any difference whether it was an employee or employees'
representative, would it?
MR. COME;

Babcock does make a-distinction with

respect to closed premises.
Q

In Republic —•

Republic got away from Babcock and Logan Plaza,

didn’t it?
MR. COME; Well, 1 so read Logan Plasa, but that of
course is the problem that w© have here.
Q

Although I must say that Babcock was not

mentioned in any one of these four or five opinions that was
written*
MS. COME:

However, it was certainly called to this

Court’s attention, and it was distinguished on the vary
grounds that X am now urging, by -the prevailing partias in
Logan Valler/.
But I think the short answer to it is the reason
why it wasn’t mentioned, was the one that Justice White, at
least, propounded, that a different balance is called for
where you have open property than when you have the kind of
closed property here.
Q

Can you really spell this out in what either

the trial examiner or the Board said?

45
MR» COME:
Q

X think you can from the —

Well/ it isn’t quite articulated in this way?

MR. COME:

1

think that the Trial Examiner comes

very, very close'to articulating it the way 1 do.
Q

But then he keeps floating over into Logan Valley,,

MR. COME: Well, I think he has two sections of his
report, one in which he deals with the Babcock point and the
other with the Second ground.
0

Mr, Come, —

MR. COME:

Yes, Your Honor?

Q

-- go ahead with Justice Blaekmun.

Q

What is the — if you prevail here, what is the

practical result?

Are you going to drive Central Hardware to

putting a big fence up around a part of its lot and saying to
its employees:

This is where you park?

Isn’t this the pragmatic aspect of your case?
MSo COME:

I don't think so, because I think that if

they ware to do that the union organisers would still have the
right to appear, try to reach the employees on the public
portions of the property, because I think that you would still
be faced with the problem of the employer who has opened up
his property to those members of the public that he prefers
and has closed it to another segment of the public which has a
message that is equally as germane to the purpose of the
business.

I don't think —
q

But they wouldn 91 have the right to go into the

closed portion,, would they?
MR. COME:

They would not have the right to go into

the closed portion, but if he does not permit them into the
closed portion, I submit that the result would be that he would
have to be subjected to the activity on the open portion.
Q

Mr. Come, —

MR. COME:

He could minimize the amount of disruption

— I don’t want to use that word; but dislocation, by how
close he would permit the union to reach the employees,

We

have that problem in the secondary boycott areas.
Q

Mr. Come, after Justice Blackmun's fence is up

around the parking lot for the employees, with appropriate
signs, suppose then the owner builds a fence around the entire
parking area and puts up signs, "For customers only? noncustomers and others will be towed away at the expense of the
owner of the car.

Parking lot exclusively for customers of

this store.”
Now, what kind of a ease do you have then?
Do you think union organisers specifically can go
in in the face of that, and disrupt, as you put it, or
dislocate the parking lot?
MR. COME:

Well, I think that the word "disruption”

is not applicable to what you5re saying.

Q

Well, let's say we have nine or ten of them

circulating around; whatever that produces.
MR. COME:

I might point out, Your Honor., that there

ware sis to thirteen in Logan Valley, and there is no showing
in the record here that these nine who were only there for
part of the time were ever present all at the same time on the
parking lot.

I mean there were nine in the area, but the

record does not show that they were all present there at the
same time,
Q

Well, what would these signs do?

What do the

signs and the fence do to the Logan Valley aspect of the case?
Or the Babcock?
MR, CQMS: Well, I think in terms of the argument
that 1 have been making, I don't think that that would alter
the fundamental balance.

However, that is not this case, and

I don01 want to speak for the Board on that. because it has not
had such a situation.
But 1 think that the logic of at least the argument
that I have been making, that would not alter the situation
because you would still have the same disparity in treatment
as to what members of the public you are going — with a
purpose related to the functioning of the store.

And I

emphasise that, because we don't have here something that is
unrelated to the operation.
Q

Well, are you suggesting that the owner of the

48
store can't discriminate between customers and non-customers?
MR. COME:

Not where the non-customers have a

purpose germane to the operation of the store# as; we have here.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you# Mr. Come.
Mr. Dunau.
We've invaded your time a little bit, and so we'll
allow you the full amount that you had reserved, and enlarge
your friend's time accordingly.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD DUNAU, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE INTEPVENOR
MR. DUNAU:

Thank you, sir.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
X think it is necessary to be blunt? and to be
blunt, the only way the Court of Appeals can be reversed in
this case is for this Court to repudiate Logan Valley.
What do we have here?

Instead of having, as we had

in Logan Valley, employees picketing — non-employees picketing
at the entrance to the store, here we had them on the parking
lot asking, talking to employees, seeking to get them to join
the union.
Suppose these non-employee union representatives in
this case had done exactly what the union representatives had
done in Logan Valley?

Namely, they had picketed at the

entrance to the store, with a sign saying, "Central Hardware
is non-union.

These employees are not receiving union wages

49
or other benefits»

Retail Clerks Union, Local 727»“

That would be exactly Logan Valley»

In Logan Valley

the distances from the entrance to the pax-king lot to the
store were 350 feet to four to five hundred feet.

Here the

distances from the entrance to the parking lot to the entrance
to the store is 425 feet to 475 feet at one store? 260 feet to
1,000 feet at another store»
Now, what are we to make of this?
the right to communicate is identical»

The blunting of

You can11 get any

closer to that entrance, whether it’s a single store parking
lot or a shopping center parking lot.
Are we to say, therefore, that if a single store
owner circles himself with a parking lot, that's okay? but if
*

that single store man should share premises in a shipping
center and a group of them encircle themselves within a parking
lot they cannot bar communication?
Q

Well, you say, then, that it is the First

Amendment that requires the permission of this union activity
here?
MR» DUNAU:

Sir, there are two answers to that.

The First Amendment is incorporated in Section 7.

Everything

that the First Amendment protects is protected by Section 7,
with this enhanced and important addition:

The First Amendment-

can reach only State action; Section 7 reaches employer action.
But the substance of what Section 7 protects is identical with

so
apt protects.

■y'nrr,

Q

Well, it’s no eo-extensive,

Even apart from

governmental and private action, it doesn't, Section 7 doesn't
get into the area of purported obscenity, for example, or -~
MR. DUNAU: But every area where free speech is
relative to a labor dispute
Q

Yes.

MR. DUNAU:

— is co-extensive? and that's all we

have to have.
Q

But, with the very big difference you've

already mentioned, that the First and Fourteenth Amendment
protect against governmental action, and Section 7 is a
statutory right as against an employer.
MR. DUNAUs

Right,

But if Section 7 does, as we

maintain, incorporate the First Amendment with respect to what
an employer may or may not do, then Section 7 reaches private
action by virtue of Congress saying,, in Section 7, we adopt
the First Amendment rights insofar as they relate to labor
disputes.
Secondly, it would be totally artificial to divide
this case based on what Section 7 allows and disregard what
the First Amendment requires.
happens:

In this case, suppose this

instead of the union representative walking off the

parking lot, he says, "I'm going to stay here; drag me off”,
and he gets dragged off by the police.

And in this case there

51
was at least one instance where police action was required to
remove the man»

Here you have State action»

Suppose, instead of coming to the Labor Board with
its complaint, suppose this storekeeper had sought an injunction
on the same grounds?

"These people are invading my parking

lot”? got a conviction, the First Amendment would be in this
case .
Now, what are we to have?
Q

A rule which says —

Air 1 getting messed up with semantics?

You

keep saying First Amendment rights, do you mean freedom of
speech?
MR, DUNAUi
Q

That's exactly what I mean»

Well, why don't you say freedom of speech?

MR. DUNAUI’m sorry, sir? that’s what I should say
because the element of what Section 7 protects here is selforganisation which means speaking, talking to people, and that’s
what Section 7 protects.
protects.

That’s what the First Amendment

You cannot have one rule on what’s going to happen

if you’re in a State court defending against a conviction or
defending against an injunction action, and have another rule
when the case is before the Labor Board.
Q

Mr. Dunau, —

MR. DUNAUi
Q

Yes, sir.

to go back to your illustration about

introducing State action by virtue of having the police eject

the man,

Suppose the owner of the store goes out and personally

ejects him?

Then you haven't any State action, I suppose you

would agree?
MR, DUNAU:
0

That's correct,

Then what do you have?

MR, DUNAU:

Then you have Section 7, which

incorporates the free speech protections of the First Amendment,
It is basic to Section 7,

What the Congress was doing in

Section 7 was to say to employers:
right to self-organization.

You cannot abridge the

What is self-organization?

It's

talking, it's speaking, it's assembling.
So we have Congress saying that you, Mr, Private
Employer, will not abridge free speech when it is exercised
by union representatives, and we declare this to be the
national rule.
Q

Bat if you rest that on free speech, you know, —

MR. DUNAU:
0

Yes, sir.

— you then could have the nine or thirteen

union organizers enter the store and move all around,
couldn't you?
MR, DUNAU:
Q

No, sir.

Well, is the First Amendment only an outdoor

activity?
MR. DUNAU:

Q

Sir?

Or is it inside, too?

Z*

MS. DUKAU:

O'

The First Amendment applies wherever it

is appropriate to exercise the right of free speech.

In Logan

l7alley it would not have been appropriate to enter into the
inside of the store and picket, and when this Court.decided
Logan Valley, it wasn’t deciding that you could enter the
store and handbill it and picket; what it said was, given the
exterior of the store and the consonance of that exterior of
the store with picketing and handbilling, you cannot prohibit
it under the First Amendment,

If you cannot prohibit it under

the First Amendment, with respect to State action, you cannot
prohibit it under Section 7 with respect to employer action.
Sometimes it seems to me we need to get right back
to the basics, the basics of this statute, as we've quoted on
page 23 of our brief, and this was the Report of the Senate
preceding the enactment of the Wagner Acts
"The right of self-organization ... is a complex
whole, embracing the various elements of meetings, speeches,
peaceful picketing, the printing and distribution of
pamphlets, news and argument, all of which, however, are
traceable to the fundamental rights of expression and assembly.
So compounded, the right of self-organisation and collective
bargaining is fundamental, being one phase of the process of
free association essential to the democratic way of life.55
That is what Section 7 did.

That is why the First

Amendment is relevant, because Congress said;

We are adopting

the First Amendment standard in Section 7 and the advance we
make is to say that under the First Amendment it protects
against State action, under Section 7, which adopts the
substance of the First Amendment, we protect against private
employer action.

Now ,
Q

So you're saying that the employer may do no

more to restrict speech than might the government, and that
whatever the government —■
MR. DUNAUs
Q

Yes, sir.

“™ can't do, the employer can't do?

ME. DUNAUs

Exactly, sir, yes, sir.

That by virtue

Section 7 we are saying that what, a policeman is forbidden
to do in throwing a union representative off a parking lot,
an employer is forbidden to do.

What a State is forbidden to

do by way of enjoining free speech on a parking lot, an
employer is forbidden to do via Section 7.

That is precisely

the position we take.
q

Then this should lead yen to say that Babcock

was wrong.
MR. DUrlAU:

Ho, sir.

It should not lead me to say

that Babcock is wrong, because I-ogan Valley rests — the
premise of Logan 'Talley is the openness of the property.

In

Babcock. s Wilcox you were not dealing with open property,
There is that vit al distinction between whether the property

55
open to the public and therefore an appropriate place in which
to express First Amendment rights, to talk, as against where
the property is closed and therefore may not be an appropriate
place*
Q

If you rely on Section 7, I don’t see what

difference it snakes whether it's open or closed, from the point
of view of your argument under Section 7.
MR» DUNAUs

Weil, if I may say so, Your Honor, there

has been a suggestion in this case, and it stems quite
properly from Babcock and Wilcox, that there axe somehow loss
rights under Section 7 when they’re exercised by non-employees
than where they're exercised by employees*

That, too, is

fundamentally in conflict with what Section 7 and the National
Labor Relations Act are about*

Q

Well, the difficulty is the Board made that

contention in Babcock and Wilcox —
Q

And lost»

Q

— and lost*

MR* DUMAU:

Unanimously,

But it made it in a case in which the

property was closed. It did not make it in a case in which the
property was open.
Q

Well, according to Section 7, what difference

does it make, if your argument is correct?
MR. DOMAUs
Q

All right, sir.

The employer has no more right than government

56
has to —
MR» DUHAU: Suppose we take the Babcock and Wilcox
standard and ignore the distinction between openness and closed.
If you have open property, Babcock and Wilcox says that part
of what you may not do, you may not discriminate«

Now, if

you have open property and admit every element of that public
which has a message, wants to patronise that store, which
wants to make that store make a profit, shoppers, deliverymen,
everybody under the sun can come in; but you close that open
property to the union representative who's got a message
which the employer doesn't like.

That is discrimination,

that is inherent, discrimination,
Q

Well, is the store any less open than the parking

lot?
MR. DUNAUs The inside of the store?
Q

Yes.

Yes.

MR. DUNAUs The inside of the store —
Q

Don't you invite the same people in?

MR. DUNAU: Sir?

There is a functional difference

between what you can do inside a store and what you can do
outside a store.

It's based on the use to which the property

is put.
Q

Well, who says?

Does the Constitution or soma

statuta say that there's a functional difference between the
parking lot and the store?

s?
MR. DUNAU:

I think this Court will say it whenever

it gets a- First Amendment case in which an employee tries to
picket inside the store, because the First Amendment doesn't
speak except as this Court speaks for it.
Now, it has been perfectly clear under Section 7
that there is a distinction between inside and outside the
store, a distinction which applies with respect to employees
themselves.

Because it is a store.

nobody, no employee

The Board says that

this has nothing to do with non-employees

no employee can engage in union solicitation on the selling
area of the floor, because it conduces to disruption.
NOW

Q

Didn't we; have a library case that dealt with

First Amendment rights inside a library?
MR. DUNAU:
Q

You did. Your Honor, but —

Hasn’t that based on what could be done?

MR. DUNAU: All it does is bring back a spark as to
m

whether you could or could not eject someone from the library,
but 1 just don't remember it well enough.
Q

No, but 1 thought we made a distinction there

between exercising First Amendment rights inside, which would
be parallel to what you're talking about, wouldn't it?

Someone

inside the store.
MR. DUNAU:
as outside.

Inside is certainly not the same thing

A New Jersey Court had no problem making a

distinction with respect to the activities of students and
teachers, saying what you can do on the outside is net the
same thing as what you can do on the inside; because of the
difference to which the property is put.
And it seems to us in this case what you get down
to saying is that solicitxon on that parking lot inconsistent
with the operation of a parking lot.

Well, it is not.

No one

is suggesting yo\i can inundeite that parking lot with fifty
organisers.

That's congesting it»

Ho one is saying you

cannot require an identification of non-emplayass coming on
that parking lot.
Ml we are saying is you cannot folanketly prohibit
non‘-employe as on a parking lot otherwise open.

The only —

the two other elements which are relevant to property.
is not being disrupted.

A right of prit~acy»

Use

Well, I can't

imagine anything less private than a parking lot.
I think we are capable of drawing distinctions between
one's living room and a parking lot; and what you have left,
therefore, is the man's title to his property, what he can do
simply because he owns it, that gets back to naked title; I
had thought that that was enactly what this Court said in
Logan Valley was not sufficient on the part of the storekeeper
when, on the other side, you had suppression of speech,

tod

what you have here, is suppression of speech.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

1 think you are well over

59
your time now, Mr. Dunan,
MR. DUNAUs

All right- sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you.
Mr. Slattern?

Mr. Aylward.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD L. AYLWARD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. AYLWARD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Cotarts
I think the crucial difference here, when you talk
about First Amendment, and you talk about Section 7, X think
when you look at Logan Valley and you look at Babcock and Wl 1 co:t,
you’ve got the same issue, because what did Justice Marshall
have to look to finally, and that is whether or not the
message that could be given in Logan Valley by this picket
could effectively be given elsewhere.
it couldnJt be effectively given.

And of course he said

So, therefore, these

people had a First Amendment right.
And Justice White, I think you very correctly stated
in the last paragraph of the Logan Valley decision that as far
as you know the National Labor Relations policy does not
require this free speech right, that they have it under Section
? if they have it at all.
And we get over under Section 7, and we’ve got the
Babcock and Wilcox case? and the same final issue has to be
asked there, and that final question is; Can that message be

60
given elsewhere other than coming on this employer's property?
And, gentlemen» I submit that Judge Gibson, on page 88, 89
and 90 of our Appendix, was the only one that found the facts»
*

And he says there are no substantial evidence in the record
showing that the employees were inaccessible or that reasonable
attempts i© communicate with them were ineffective.
laid he goes on to say, the second element of Babcock
and Wilcox, there is no evidence of any non-employee solicita­
tion being permitted or sanctioned by the company»

This

finding is drawn from thin air, completely devoid of factual
sub stantiation.
Kow, gentleman, I think the Court in Logan Valley
went to great lengths to prove the governmental aspect of
that Iiogan Valley Shopping Center,

1 think it's very

.important that you saw fit to devote quite a bit of your
opinion to comparing the physical attributes of that shopping
center.

And the only thing you didn’t find similar to the

Marsh, vs. Alabama,' the suburb of Mobile, was the fact that
there in Marsh the people that owned the town also owned the
residences; whereas you didn’t find it in Logan Valley.
So if we are to accept the premise that the Board
would have us now find, you don’t have to worry about these
physical characteristics any more.

All you have to find is

something like a vague term for open, that you've invited the
public to corae on your lots.

So you don’t have to have all

62
these physical characteristics any longer.
Q

I take it you don't fundamentally disagree with

Mr. Dunau that Section 7 applies the First Amendment to the
private employer?
MR. AYLWARDs
that.

No, 1 don't have any problem with

I think that what the beard does ■»Q

In which event Logan Valley is really rather

irrelevant, isn’t it?
MR. AYLWARD;

Yas, it is. Your Honor.

Even though it’s the same question you had to ask in
both situations.
Q

And it’s really just an excuse to — it’s really

just sort of some background to make a different rule in this
kind, of a case than in the Babcock kind of a case.
MR. AYLWARD;

Well, I think we’ve been unjustly

put upon when they say we try to draw the difference of a
picket having a superior right than a union organiser coming
on.

We don't draw that difference.
All we’re saying is, if that guy wants to come on

and sell membership in his union, and he can do"it by other
than coining in our lot, then he should do it, without violating
our rights are.
Q

So it53 just a time and place problem?

fit» AYLWARD;
what Babcock says.

There's a time and place. And that’s

Babcock says you look at the residences of

the employees and you loos at the position of the employer.
And as long as you can find alternate means and as long as you
can find the no-solicitation rule was actively enforced —
Q

Well, Section ? — so you apparently agree that

Section ? does give employees and organizers and unions some
approach to a place like this that non-labor-related people
v/ouldn't have, say there was picketing here by some other
group?
MR. &YLW&RD:
a statute.

Absolutely, because. I think you have

They corae on her©wider a statutory right, and

under the statute the Beard has balance, arid this Court, in
looking over the broad shoulder, you say, All right, you’ve
done right here, you interpreted the Act properly.

0.

So this isn't a case of anybody claiming that

this store owner is subject to the First .Amendment.

This is

& case he's subject to Section 7?
MR. AYLWARD:

Yes. That's what we're charged with.

We're charged with not violating the First Amendment, wo9re
charged with violating Section 7.

And we say under that

violation, whether it be to apply Logan Valley, or you apply
Babcock and Wilcox, you've got to look and ask the question:
Where could these people get the message?

And what is the

message? The message is: Come on and join my union.
Now, certainly if they could, go to their homes and
sell it, then the employees under all the rules can come on

S3
the erap!oyerss property and talk among themselves and say *
wWe think it would be a good idea to join this union? what do
you think about it?”

And that's all that's to be accomplished

under our labor laws, is for these employees to get the message.
And I submit that they can get this message without
coining on our parking lots in this situation.

I suggest that

Judge Gibson says there is no evidence of cur lots being the
only place where these union organizers can come on and sell
membership«
Now, I think you have a very important

I think

there's a lot of people looking at this case, as is obvious
from all the amicus briefs that have been filed in it, because
I think if you do find that our lots for some reason are open
to the public, then you've got thousands and thousands of. other
free-standing stores that have, that provide parking in front

of their stores for customers, you'll find that these lots are.
now going to be embarked on and deluged by all the union
organisers and who else, because you will have indicated that
these are open to the public.
Now, as far as a buffer "zone being created, et
cetera, I don't think that that's important, because I think
that —
G

I thought Mr. Come indicated that if you did

fence it in and put all these restricted signs up, the
situation might be different.

64
MR» AYLWARD:

I don't know why, because I don't see

how he can overcome the question;

Aren't these people

available — can't you get your message to them without coming
on the lot, whether there be a fence there or what-have-you?
And also as far as Mr. Dunan * s situation in saying
that if you hold for us in this case, for Central, you have to
reverse Logan Valley.

I don't think that.

I think Logan

'•'’alley stands for one proposition, and Justice Marshall said,
All I am saying here in this case, in Logan Valley, that we've
got physical characteristics similar to Marsh vs. Alabama.
We've got the fact that it's open to the public, nobody is
being restricted from this shopping center.

We've got a

message to be conveyed, and that is that Weis Market doesn't
pay good uniori wages.

And we've got whether or not there’s

alternate means available without coming in front of the
store.

And that's all he found in Logan valley.

And I think

that's good law.
Now, I think that ™~
Q

Well, one thing that’s true in Logan Valley

and that is that all of the opinions didn't — none of them
even mentioned Babcock.
MS. AYLWARD:

Yes, and probably so, because I think

the —
Q

That•d one thing in common; right?

MR. AYLWARD:

Yes, that's right.

I think, Judge, you

65
went to great lengths in your first footnote in Logan Valley,
so we're not making any decision under the NLRA.
Blacky in the same way in his dissent, he says?

Justice
Neither the

majority nor I reach any decision under the NLRA.
And-Justice White — I'm sorry he left, but I think
he hit the thing right on the head when he said:

There's no

labor rights involved.
And why were you so concerned about labor rights if
Babcock wasn't even mentioned?

I submit because the Board

submitted an amicus brief in your Logan Valley, and it might
be worthwhile digging it out and looking at it.
Now, to what —
Q

But we're not sure yet whether this is a Legan

Valley case or a Babcock case, are we?
•MR. AYLWARD: Well, I don't think it really makes any
difference.

I think the sole criteria in both cases is whether

you can get the message across somewhere else.
Q

Well, —

MR. AYLWARD:
Q

In fact, that just goes back to what —

Well, the whole point, of course, in Logan

Valley, in showing the public characteristics and attributes
of that shopping center, was to make it the equivalent of the
company town in Marsh vs. Alabama., which in turn had decided
that a company town, just like any conventional municipal
town, therefore is a State within the Fourteenth Amendment; and

66

the Fourteenth Amendment in turn incorporates the free speech
protections of the First Amendment»

And since it was a

constitutional decision, it was the basic key and foundation
of the Logan Valley decision to show that it was the equivalent
of the city itself.
MR. AYLWARD; Exactly, Your Honor.
Q

And it has really nothing to do with Section 7»

MR. AYLWARDs Exactly, Your Honor, because —
Q

So it does:

make a difference whether or not

this is Logan Valley.
MR. AYLWARDs
on the streets?

— where is it more appropriate than

And on the sidewalks.

Now, certainly the

streets and sidewalks in Logan Valley weren't any different
‘khan Marsh vs. Alabama.

But they are a hack of a lot

different than our free-standing parking lot.
Now, I think that gets to the issue of what Mr.
Dunau says.

They have a right of free speech where appropriate.

And, gentlemen, I submit they do have a right of free speech
where appropriate.

It is appropriate, under the right of free

speech in Logan Valley, to be right out there in front of
that store entrance and say, this is the store, not the other
16 that are involved? but it{s this store here that doesn’t
pay union wages.

And that was the appropriate place.

But in our case, where is it appropriate?

It's

appropriate if you can find them elsewhere, to go to their

67
homes,

Their own man has testified the best place to get

across the union message is by house calls,
Q

And this is what Babcock tells us?

MR, AYLWARD: And this is what Babcock tells us.
Babcock says if you’ve got alternate means, then we balance

the rights of the parties —
Q

The very same kind of means that are present

here, aren’t they?
MR. AYLWARD: The very same kind. That's right.

The

house call, the advertising in the newspaper, the union meetings,
all these.

None of these — they didn't even try them.
Q

But the invasion, the burden on the employer is

different here than in Babcock1,,
MR. AYLWARD: Why do you say that, sir?
Q

Well, parking lots open to the public.

MR. AYLWARD:
Q

Oh — under what rule?

Under what rule?

It's just open, 1 mean it's

just
MR. AYLWARD:

In our case it's not open to the public,

because the record is replete and —
Q

Well, I'll put it this way,

A manufacturing

establishment has a much more limited clientele coming to it,
MR. AYLWARD:
Q

Yes.

Than a retail establishment that will take

anybody as a customer

68
MR. AYLWARD:
Q

All right.

Well, that's all l*m saying.

MR. AYLWARD; All right. Let me give you the case of
?
People vs., Garutoa, and in fact the Chief Justice of the
Illinois Supreme Court, Justice Barnhouse, who admitted me to
the Illinois bar, he gave that decision.

And what happened

there? The same union, in fact the same attorney that
?

represented the Retail Clerks in that case represented Garutou
in that case, and in that case they said;

under Babcock and

Wilcox, we have a right to come on a Sears store parking lot
under the Fifth Amendment — I mean under the First Amendment.
And there the Illinois Supreme Court says;

Kow, wait a minute,

it’s not First Amendment, if you guys have any rights, you're
union organizers, you have to go back to Babcock and Wilcox.
And that case, came up here and you gentlemen looked
at it and you denied certiorari.
I feel like the old judge yesterday that said before
you, and he said you could —
Q

Well, don’t you wish it did mean something here?

MR. AYLWARDYes, I think it might.
[Laugh': er. ]
As far as the appropriateness of the-place to give
the right of free speech, I think this Court also in the
Adderly case that we qi.oted in our brief, vs. Florida, there
you did have, you had fitate property, you had a State peniten-

69
tiary, you had people coding on, and there you said this isn’t
the appropriate place»
Gentlemen, 1 submit that, really, our lots are not
the appropriate place.
Q

But that place in Adderly would go in one section

of your parking lot.
MR. AYLWARD:
Your Honor.
Q

All

I

I don’t know how large that lot was,

know is we have

That’s about as small as you could get.

MB. AYLWAFD: Well, five acres is pretty small when
you take a 70,000-square-foot storee off it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Aylward.
Thank, you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:50 o’clock, a.m„, the case was
submitted.]
