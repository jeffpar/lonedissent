ORAL ARGUMENT OP ROBERT G, OOWERS, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF TUE PETITIONER
MR. BOW.RS:

In this case, differing from tho previous case,
the def:endent -- there's no question about his indigency now

or then.

Ho is no-,1 in State prii::on.

He is a young man who,

I don't thir-1< there is any question, ever raised by anyboay,
but that he was absolutely impecunious.

But it was , as a matter of fact, without arg\ltlent,
To which the aefendant excepted. ~nd thio is the crux

of our ca::e, whether or not the <lefe11d11nt was entitled to a
transcript of 'the evidcntiary portion of tho trial which
c:=mi~d on November the 11th.
The mistrial wns ordered on November the 14th.

The

trial it!lelf -- tho jury h~d c01m1enced its deli beration at
9:30 or. that morning.

There were three days of trial.

Now, the queation has been raised in the previous
casa al::>ut whether or not counsel could reconstruct.

Well,

there c;ain, we have e peculiar aituation here in which we
don't n~ed to have the reconstruction. That we could probably
have do~c for purposes of an eppeal.

But for purpotes of

preparetion and cross-examination ~t the second trial, this
we thoi..Jht was aboolutely esaantial .

In other words, you wanted a trMscript of the

wo know it has never been prepru:cd in any way, shnpe, form, or

BOWERS:

I don't want to

mislead the Court ~n any way.
O
MR.

It was a murder trial, was it?
BOWERS:

Yes, sir.

6

In this particular case, the young defendant -- I say
young; 20 , 21 yearo old; and at my age, that' E younq -- was
charged with beating his girlfriend's grandmother to death
with a frying pan in an effort to rob her of hor worldly
possesstons.

Now, whether or not he's guilty is not a matter

that's l>efore this Court or was never subject for my determination~ l was appo inted to represent him, and I hopl) I did the
best jc~ that I could possibly do.
But, be that as it may be, I don• t think that I did
the best; job that I could have possibly done, had I had that
transcript.
It's difficult to argue this ~.attar in this Court

and try to put thi

Court back in the courtroom in Craven

County, New Bern, North Carolina.

We hr:d n fine judge.

We

had a g~od court. 'l'he courtroom is a fir.a place to work.
But thc,.e wno one uitncss, Hho wna the primary witness for the
State.

A Cq>tain P. M. Bratcher of the New Bern Police

Deparm,nt.
Now, Captain Bratcher had made no notes. This
appearo in the trnnscript which is before you, of the record
which is before you, had made no notes of any kind, type, or
descrip~ion, with respect to anything that he hcd done in
connection with the investigation of this case.

Yet he

testifi9d that he had spent one hour an~ a half at the scene;
but if you uill read the testimony as elicited in the secor.d

7

trial, uou will find that he didn • t account for more thon
five minutes of his tir.ie there.
He said that he was at the funeral homo for an hour
and a half.

Yet ho had made no notes.

He oaid he -- he

testified with respect to the arrest of the defendant, without
a warralt; his incarceration, without a warrant, 11ithout: being
taken bafore a cagistrate.

He testified about biking him out

of jail and taking him back to the Detective Division of the

Police l>epartment, and questioning.

Oh, yes, he testified tJ at

he cautioned him under Hirande.
110

testified further about the statements made to

him, bu:: no11:here ill this whole procedure had he ever filed the
first n:>te , 1th bio supervisors, nor had he mace the first

note for his records.

we

could not have asked to examine the notes that

he made, llllder the Jenks rule, we co\Jldn 't have done anything.
'l'he only thing ho did was sit in that courtroom with a folder

in his 'land, which we found to contain, upon questioning, the

record >f the coroner's inquest.
Q

Is this

MR. BOWERS:
Q
Mil •

who is this, P.H. Bratcher?
P. M. Bratcher.

P. M. Bratcher?

BOWERS :

Yes, sir.

Now, this, I will frankly say, I don't think this
prejudi:ed tho defendant a great deal in his doing that,

8

because wo pointed out what he w11s doing, nnd I think it
probably militated more against him than it did in his favor.
I'm trying to be candid llbout this.

I'm not trying

to say that the prosecutor was guilty of any misconduct of nny

kind, t1pe, or description.
O

Let me just ask, in order to got this straight:

The prosecutor did or did not have the trMscript?
~IR. BOWERS:

No, sir; he did not.

Or if he did, I

did not know ebout it; and I don't think that he did.

He was

a very 1onorebl0 r.ian, and is, and I'm cure he would have told
rnB

had b8 hnd it.

In fact, he 1rould probably have hc.ndC'd it

to me if he'd of hnd it.

O

Was n reporter available to you?

Mn. aownns:

Your Honor, yea, cir, the reporter was

available.

O

And the reporter hcd his notes?

MR, BOWE~S:
Q

Yee, sir, the report:or had his notes.

Did you have any apecific q1.0stions ebout what

some sp~cific answers to questions were that you could have
had tho reporter read them?

Mn.

BOWERS:

It would hove neoeasitated probably a

day's d~lay for him to go get his notes.

Now, this tiould have -- had he brought his notes to
court , 1th him, this would hnve been available.
Q

Which you could have had him do, with prior

9

notice?
MR. BOWERS:

Yes, sir.

Q

Did you have a reporter

O

You could have ht1d him at the second trial --

MR. BOWERS:

Now, one moment hf!re, if I may inter-

excuse me, may I answer your question there?
Q

MR.

Certainly.
BOWERS:

One question in this, you see, the

motion wns denied1 we were unnble to get a heoring on the
motion, it was denied, and we were forced to go i=ediatcly,
within ton J'.!linutes, into the sclc~tion of the jury.
Q

Yes, but before court, if you hnd asked the

reporter to bring the notes there, the reporter would have
brought then.
MR. BOWERS:
didn't,

I'm sure he would hove.

Frankly, I

I'1:1 not trying to
Q

Well, let's see, Mr. Bowers, I wonder how

practical that would have been.

You co<.1ldn' t

put

him on the

stand.

MR. BO IERS:
O

No, air.

What you would have had to do was tclk with

him outside the courtroom, outside the trinl, get a recess or
someth1ng, nfter you heard the captain testify and you thought
he had testified differently at the first trial, you'd hnve
had to go to the reporter and say, •uey, I think I remember

10

such-and-such that he said,"

Isn't that what you'd have had

to do?
MR. BOWERS:
Q

This is correct.

Well, how practical would thet have been?

MR. BOWERS:

I don't think it would have been

practical at all.
Q

Well, would the reporter have read you his notes

before the trial, if you'd have asked him?
MR. BOWERS:
again,

my

Yes, sir, he would have, but, there

problem ,as this:

had he read mo those notes it

still would have not furnished me the need that I had for
cress-examination later during the -Q

Right, how could you have known what the need was

until y~u'd heard what he had to say -MR. BOWERS:
Q

Still had a risk.

-- at the second trial?

MH. eOtlERS:

No, sir1 I couldn't.

This was my problem, I didn't know what the situation
would

1;..

until it arose.
Q

I think you may have ans1rered one qllestion a

little too hastily thex·e, and I'd like to clarify it.

To

someone's queation you said you could not have put him on the
stand.

Uhat would prevent you from calling the reporter,

putting him on the scand, and asking him to read into the
record of the second trial testimony that he had taken down in

11

the first trial?
MR. BOWERS:

I could not havo put him -- I did

answer that too hastily -- I could not have put him on the
stand 'Ultil I had reviewed what he hed to testify about, res.
Well, you conceivably could take a chance if

0

you were sure, by just putting him on to clarify the record.
MR.

BOWERS:

Of course, there it would have been the

probler., he was also the court reporter thot wa!I t king th..
second trial.
lell, that wouldn't stop it.

Q

Ml't. BOWERS:

No; I agree with you, that wouldn't

have;-There are woys to uork it.

Q
M.l..

BOWERS:

it would have been inconvenient, but

it wo.u d not. ha'l.'8 stopped it.
Well, ia that the way you cross-excmine

Q

wit:ncs es?

I never heard of anything like this.

MR.
Q

BOHERS:

No, cir.

Well, I submit that it is often done, counsel,

and I tave done it myself in the trial of cases, to call the
reporter from the prior trial, put him on the stand, and read
the tectimony of the particular witness, or somo other aspect
of the trial.
~lll. BOWERS:

Yes, sir; but

my

problem in cross-

examinction -- that woul~ hove b ~n rebuttal testimony, yes,

12

that ,,;ould have re.butted what he said, but it would not have
given me the paper that would have said,•now, on such-and-such
a day did you not testify as follows,hand then ask hirn. •And

was your answer not as follows?•

.

"Now, how do you put theve

two together? . .How do you get your position that your answer
today is in conformity with your anm<er before?"
The typo of cross-examination is detail d, of course.
And this is where our complaint is, not trith the fact that the
court .ceporter was not available to come back later and say,
"Oh, no, he testified this way on that day."
Q

But, do I understand correctly that -- and this

may be of como ifflportance -- that you said that if you had
asked the 1:eporter, out of court, he would hove read bn::k nny

part of the notes of the first trial that you wanted?

Frankly, I don't

able to r&ad the transcript; and my own personal recollection
doesn't. tell me.

State nor to the defendant.

MR. BOWERS:

It's a c0111pletely secret hearing.

MR. BOWE:r.s,

You don't?

HR. BOWERS:

I think we should, but, unfortunately,

we don' t .
Q

But the rich man can have one there if he wants

to?

mt.

amu,s, Yes,

sir.

Now, I might cay this, in the F~urth Dietrict,in our
State, \:.he judges nre now requiring the court reporter to come
in for preliminary henrings; but this is not under any mandate
that ha

coma down •

o

Dut you would make the same argument about the

prelimir ary learing tes.:imony then?

16

MR. BOWERS:

Yes, sir; I certainly would. Representing

the defendant, I cortainly would make that, because I

think he' •

entitled to ewry defense that's available to anybody.
Q

Mr. Bowers, do you feel that the fact that the

same cowtsel defended in both trials is a factor?
MR.

BOWERS:

I

don't think it'll a factor that should

b4ll cons~dered in this particular ~tter.

I think it's s

factor, naturally, in the actual trial, becau&e there's a
certain feel to any case, that any lawyer gets that tries
cases;

nd I think that with this !eel he can go through the

second ·rial probably better than the firct one.
Q

If we were to go along with you, would the

ruling place a premi\1111 on mistrials?
MR.

BOWERS:

No, sir.

I think that the State would argue that it would,
but I don't think so.

I frankly think that we've got an

excelle.1t jlldiciary in North Carolina, and I think that -well, i
stayed

this particular case, we had no transcript; the jury
ut one cay; and the mistrial was over.

This was not

a matter of decidirg whether a transcript would be made

availal> e or not,

That factor nev r entered into it,

The

court h d found they w~re in a hopeless deadlock.
Now, so far, tho court -- there cannot be a mistrial
in Nort 1 Carolina unless a judge order$ it.

And most of the

judges ·equire that the jurors sit the~e until every reasonable

17

avenue bas been pw.sued and they're satisfied of this fact.

tlell, we've seen a lot and heard a lot c.bout

could i.se a word of approbation hE?.re, but I think I'd better

leave i~ off -- sone who are not as ethical as others, and
some who are trying to try cases other than in logol process,
are atitl a rarity, and I hope th£y remain a rarity,

they di3appcar entirely,

Thank you, Mr. Bowera,

18

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. CHRISTINE Y. DENSON,
ON
MRS ,

DE?ISON:

BEHALF

OF

THE

RI:SPONDENT

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mny it

please the Court:

We want very strenuously to divorce this case frOll!I
the one this Court has just heard, becnuse we're in, of course,
a far different situation with this case.
The North Carolina system I am very proud of, we do
have t.riala de novo even for the pettiest of misdemeanors: and
in the event those cases are appealed or collaterally attacked
by certiorari or by habeas corpus filed somewhere clee, a
transc·ipt would he available, and the narrative statement
that our appellate courts require would be forthC01!1ing from
that t ·anscript, which would be mado availnble.
So we're certainly not talking about the cases that
I thin , the Court has -- as I read your decisions -- previously
decided, where we're talking about a direct attack, we're
talkinq about a direct appeal, we're talking about a collateral
attack on habeas corpus, with the question of transcript being
made available.
Rather, we're talking about the mistrial situation,
which can be extel'.ded -- thank you -- we're talking about the
mistri~l situation which, as the Court has already pointed out,
can be extended not only in the mistrial application but in
preliminary hearing.

As Your Honors pointed out, a rich man

19

could hire a reporter to come in and take the transcript, and
could make that avail-ible to himself on his trial, and coUld
therely impeach his witnesses.
We're talking also about the trial de novo situ~tion,
which we have in North Carolina a..,d in many other States: a
rich n an again could hire a ~-eporter to coma in on his traffic
offen~e and hear the testimony there and have that reporter
avail~ble at his appeal in superior court, to again try to
impeach the testimony.
So we're talking about an application that is far
divorced from the pravio~ decisions of this Court, and we' re
talkirg about an application that could be very sweeping and
could go not only to this mistrial situation, of which,
hopef~lly, there are a limited number, but could go to the
preliP-inarJ hearing or to any other trial or any other kind of
testirr.ony by a witness who comes on at tho trial which finally
results in a conviction.

And we would emphasize that fact to

the Court.

li/3 have also in this case no indication that counsel
did try to contact the court reporter.

Wa note that the

Appendix shows that the motion for the transcript, whether
actually p~esented to the court at that time or not, was dated
the 25th of November, and the man was not tried until midDecemb~r.

And so counsel knew what he was going to do on the

25th of November, at least, in making lli11 motion for a

20

transc,..ipt.

And there is no evidence that he made cny effort

to get up with the court reporter.
He says the reporter bould have told him what was in
that transcript; he could have made notes himsolfi end then,
again, the reporter was available and if, on trial, he fo,;nd
from h.s own notes that there were solOC! discrepcncieo, he could
have a<Jked those questions of the court reporter end brought the
court ·eporter on to impeach the witness.
As it wes, he had, of course, available to him the
fact tl at this Captain Bratcher had made no notes.
that out to the jury.

He pointed

lie pointed out to the jury that the

alleged confession was never reduced to writit1g, cgain calling
into question the credibility of that witness.
In fact, we think that he had available to him all
of the thit1gE1 which the jury could see that would impeach tho
credibility of this witness,

We think, rather, we've got a

case w \Ore, al though there are some alleged discrepancies in

the te Umony, -- and we don't know what those discrepanciea
actuall y were -- they're not important to this case.
We're talking about the difference between quastioning a 1itness 30 or 45 minutes and an hour and a half.
don't think that's ir.iportant.

We

Talking about whether or not he

made s-,me comn,entc: at the first trial ebout tho defendant's
clothe,; again, that can't

be

important.

Dowdy, 1ho was preoent tha second tirne the defendant confessed,
and tesi;ified about that, or was it Captain Bratcher himi:;elf?
That can 't be impo:ctant.
Q

Was Captain Bratcher tte key prosecution

witness ?
MRS. DENJON:

Your llonor, I would ony no, I would

not say he was.
Q

He

testified as to the defendant's confc sion,

didn't 1ei'
MRS. DENSON:

He testified as to the defendant's

confession t.he fir:;t time; then Officer Dowdy got on, who wa3
present the second time t.he defendant r~1>eated his ctatement
in front of Bratcher , Ethel Best, his girlfriend, and Officer
Dowdy.

So we have a reconfirn1ation of those things.

His

statement was essentially the amte, even down to the fact that
Ethel E_st dealt the blow with tl1e knife and he didn't do that

So we have some corroboration there of Bratcher's
testimony by Officer flowdy.

Is it P, M, Bratcher or P. H, Bratcher?

MRS. DENSON:

ind~x of witnesses he's called P. M, Bratcher,
MES, DENSON 1
O

I believe it's P. M.

It's not important.

MRS• DENSON :

I talked to Captain Bratcher as

recently as yesterday ebout the l'lQtter.
In short, we think that the allegod discrepancies
here, a,:,d counsel admits that he can't say for sure what those
discrep :ineies are, are not important discrepancies in this
cue.

'\nd for the Court to use this case as a atep, to take

a very Jiant step, to make tra11ocripts available to defendants,
we thin; would be a serious miscarriage of j~tice.
As the Court has pointed out, wo think that this
would p~t a premiun on mistrials.

Not only, of course, do the

23

disagreeing jurors cause mistrials, but the conduct of the
defendant or of some witness or even of soma police officer,
as we've had in ou:: O\m State, where the policcm::m will put

defend~nts in handcuffs in view of the jury, or soma such
thing, can cause a mistrial,
If the defendant has some key testinony and his
attorn£.{ has not kn01m about it before, and ho doesn't likfl
what his attorney does by way of cross-cx&mination of that
witness, we think it would put a premium on tho mistrial
situation;for him to cause a mistrial, knowing that he could
get a free transcript from the State =d have that available
for his attorney on the next trial to better cross-examine
the wit1esses.
So we fear that result.
We fear also, of course, the ovorburdening of our
trial c:>urts.

Ne ualte transcripts available when the

defende..~t is directly nppeali~g or collaterally attacking his
c onvict.i.on.
Carolina.

we feel that they're entitled to that in North
He have dor:e that voluntarily on the smallest

offense.
But to require the court reporter to delay the
activities of the court, to delay the preparation of transcripts for direct nppeals, in order to prepare the trenscripts
of thes~ mistrials, w~uld again cause the delay in the court
system, and would seriously overburden the reporting of our

24

own State courts a11d those of other States in the federal
courts , we thi nk.
For that reason, we ask the Court not to take that
step.
Q

H011 many mistrials did you have in t:hia county

last year?
MRS. DENSON:

Your Honor, I don't have tho&~

statist ics -0

About two or three?

MRS. DENSON:

Your Honor, I have no idea.

I don't

even have the statistics for our State.
Q

So you really don't know how much ot n burdoo

it woull be, do you?
fffiS.

DENSON:

No,

0

I'n not disputing what you say, but you

WO

don't.

Dut we t.'link that this - -

emphasise the burden.
MRS. DENSON: Well, Your Honor, far from those that
we have now, we aro afraill that this will give them an
additio:ial reason to l!lll.ke a mistrial.

r,ot only the defendant

who would tend to be disruptive anyuay, but the defendant who,
knowing that he's got a transcript available if he causes a
mistrial and feels, for some reason, that he's not happy with
coun$8l and could do better the next tire , maybe even changing
counsel, this would give him an additional reason to want one.
Q

Well, what I'm suggesting i• -- I'm wondering

25
whether you need all that additional weight on this tr~in.

That's one thing I - - .
MRS. DENSON:

Well, I don't think anyone knows, Your

Honor; certainly I don't.

I don't know the incidence of it

now, but I'm afraid that the incidence 11ould be increased.
And this is our great fear.

We think that the defendant, on a showing of need,
might b3 entitled to a transcript.

There may be oo:nc :roa11on

that th:, court reporter is not DVllilablc.

There 11my be some

reason of a key State'£ witness, ~:hich we don't hnve in this
case.

There may bo occasion for some key testimony that he

does wa1t to check .

But, firut of all, we don't have any indication in
this ctPe that he couldn't have secured it if he tried1 and,
secondly, we don't have that indication of special need in
this case.
Q

Hell, an I recall it, your appellate court

said that th.ere had been no showing of diocrepancie• or need
for tbc transcript in thia case?
MRS. DENSON:

No, I think the essential rei:son our

court m~de no decision was the first renson I alluded to, that
there had been no ohowing t.hat he had not had the court
reporte::: avnilable at all, and thnt there is no showing that
he made any effort to r.iake use of th.>t forl!l(!r transcript in
between the trials.

And for that rP.ason there was no showing

26

of need.
Q

But didn • t they say that there hadn • t been any

.ahowing that there were discrepancies in the testimony?
MRS. DENSON:

I believo Judge 11.allard did discuss,

since I. urged to him aa I urge to this Court today, that the
points at which there were alleged discrepancies, which appear
in the Appendix, are minor points.
Q

Was there a motion for a ne11 trial after thic

second trial?
MRS. OQ!SON1

Yes, I believe there wasi the usual

motions that ere mnde for a new trial, nnd so forth.
Q

And did it include this ground?

MRS. DZNSON I

It must have.

I think he used all of his grounds he

had availcble, yas, air.
Q

And I suppose after trial, if ho had thought

there w re discrepancies in the testimony, after trial he could
have asked the court reporter to read this testimony, and
might have pointed up specific discrepancies?
MRS. DENSON: Well, yes, Your Honor.

Practically, I

think t:c1e time for doing that would be before the defendant
rested his case.
ready b

The court, of course, gives him time to get

make his presentation, and at that point I think he

could hnve searched his memory for any discrepancies he
thought there were.
The court reporter was there at that time, and

27

he coull have asked for a receos.

And, taking two years to come

to this Court certainly is far and awo.y a greater delny than
the one day that might have been occasioned by getting the
court .roporter to search his notos.

And, although I cannot

say this to tho Court with certainty, I'm fairly certain the
court would have allowed him that delay if he told tl-.e court
that he thought there were discrepancieo and he ~anted to see
what th

reporter's notes showed,
We think there has been on absence by the defendant

of any chowing for special noed in this case.

J\Jld, at the

very le st, if the Court is going to say transcripts ohould be
availab e, we think it ought to bo restricted to those cneee
where t ere is some sort of ::bowing or need,
For that reason, "e would ask the Co'llrt not to extend
the doc rine on trenscripts and to say that in the cue of

mistria a they rc=in a nullity, they're not i1t?p0rtant for
doubl.e

eopardy, they're not important for these reasons

unless :here is

S011!9

special need in the case.

'l'hank you,

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mrs. Denson.

Hr, 80'.iers, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGU.tENT OF ROBBRT G. BOWERS,

nso. ,

ON BEHALF OP THE PBTITIONER

MR, BOWERS:

Your Honor, I wnnt to make just one very

JO-second -- short comment:

28

In our statute, which appears on page 5 of my brief,
7A-450, subsection (b) says,

"Whenever a person, under the

standards and procedures set out in this sul:lchapter, is
determined to be an indigent person entitled to counsel, it is
the res~onsibility of the State to provide h:l.m with counselft
-- and these are the il!lportant woro.s -- a,md the other necessary
expenee1 of representation.•
I would like to point that out to th~ Court, end

only that.

With that, I sit down.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: 'l'hank you, Mr. Bowers.

Thank you, Mrs, Denson.
The case is submitted.
