MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Brown, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST J. BROWN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE PETITIONER
MR. BROWNs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case, or. certiorari to the Tenth Circuit, brings
to the Court, for the first time since it was enacted as part
of the Revenue Act of 1928, what is now Section 482 of the
Internal Revenue Code.

That provision is as follows:

‘In. any case of two or more organisations, tradas, or
businesses owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the
same interests, the Secretary or his delegate" —~ the
Commissioner, as I'll phrase it — "may distribute, apportion,
or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances
between or among such organizations, trades, or businesses, if
he ieterrr. : :: that such distribution, apportionment, or
allocation in necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes
or clearly to reflect the income of any such organizations,
trades, or businesses,n
This provision, of course, expresses the judgment
that autonomous business units will exercise self-interest in

4
bargaining power which will cause income and outlays to reflect
the performance of function ar3 the acquisition of benefits
ir accordance with the values of the market.
But, on the other hand, when we have units under
common control, a host of factors, which may or may not include
tar considerations, may distort this picture and cause
considerable divergence between income/expenditures on the one
hand, and performance of function or the acquisition of benefits
on the other.
So that the regulations have always provided, as
they provide now, since 1934 that the authority givers here is
not solely, or even necessarily primarily, to cases of
improper accounting or fraudulent, colorable, or sham trans­
actions , or a device designed to evade or avoid taxes.

But

the authority extends to any case in which, by inadvertence or
design, toce.hla income:

dealing at arm’s length with another uncontrolled taxpayer.
h‘o bring performance of function and taxable income
into line, to create what some courts have referred to as
economic reality, the Commissioner may and often has found it
necessary to analyse pricing, charges for services, distribu­
tion Oi receipts, „ or the bearing of burdens of expenditures»
j.n dUxs case, the Commissioner found it necessary to

5

allocate to the taxpayer banks a substantial part, some 40
percent, of. the premium income received by a life insurance
company m

common control for the years 1954 through 1959.
His allocation was upheld by the Tax Court, relying

on its previous revie-rad decision in Logal^Finanee Corporation,
a decision which had thereafter bean affirmed by the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals.

In the Local Finance Corporation decision, the Tax
Court had reviewed extensively, and reference was made in this
case in the Tax Court to those findings — had reviewed
extensively the nature and customs ofthe business of credit
insurance, which is much involved here.
The Tench Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed
the Tax Court, disagreeing with the Seventh Circuit in Local
Finance.
Because of this conflict and because the significance
of Section 482 increases as business aggregates grow not only
larger but.

::e gloried in their nature, we have more and more

cases where a business aggregate includes corporations that
are subject to methods of taxation other than the normal,
foreign corporations, Western Hemisphere trade corporations,
and life insurance companies, as in this case.
For those reasons, the government sought certiorari,
which this Court granted.
Tl'u facts giving rise to the controversy are as

s
followss
The taxpayers are two national banks:

First Security

Bank of Ur h, and First Security Bank of Idaho.

They are wholly

owned subsidiaries of First Security Corporation, a publicly
corned holding company, which owns a number of other corporations
as well, including First Security Company, a management
company, which I will refer to as "management company” to
avoid confusion, Smith £ Sons, an insurance agency,

And,

beginning in 1954, First Security Life, an insurance company
incorporated in that year, which is one of the prim© actors
in this case.
But we should go back to 1948, at the outset.
Beginning then, and since that time, the banks have offered to
their borrowers credit life insurance.

This is diminishing

term life insurance, under which, in case of the death.of the
borrower, his debt will be paid off to the creditor.
The premium charged throughout and by all here
concerned was one dollar per* hundred per year.
the usual and standard rate in the industry.

This has been
This premium,

though apparently it sounds small, permits generous commissions
to be paid to the person who sells the insurance.

It has

been customary in the industry to pay commissions in the
neighborhood of 50 percent of the premiums.
Q

Is that, of each year's premium?

.*?.* 3R0v?i£:

Yes, Your Honor.

They are often paid in

7
advance.

This is usually measured by the term of the debt.

If the debt is, say, to be repaid in three years, then a
single premium will be collected at the outset to cover the
three-year debt.
Q
the

So that, the —

And the commission approximates 50 percent of

—
ME. BROWN:
Q

Fifty percent of the premium paid,

whole premium?

ME. BROWN:

Yes,

It is possible, and in many cases it happens, that
a credit life insurance company will issue a policy directly
to the borrower, and he will be the policyholder and hold it,
However, in these cases, or in this case, ets demonstrated by
the exhibits in the record, the banks followed another
procedure.
They took out group life insurance policies beginning
in 1948 — or each bank took out a group life insurance policy
covering the lives of their borrowers who qualified.

In 1948

this was with the Credit Life Insurance Company of Ohio; in
1953 this was changed to another group policy with the American
Bankers Life Insurance Company of Florida.
So that the procedure that

was followed was when the

borrower came to the bank, his loan was approved, the loan
officer, we are cold, made available, informed him of, offered
the record of course doesn't repeat the conversations, but

8
there is hard selling and there is soft selling, and then
there is just disinterested selling.

Both sides were

interested, and we don't suggest that it makes a difference
whether this was pressed or not.
In any event, credit life insurance was offered or
made available to the borrower? if necessary, it was explained
to him, apparently, often it was desired.

If he was interested

he was give??, by the bank an application form to fill out,
• There are copies in the record,, they are- relatively simple.
The qualifications are minute? you have to be under 65, and
there are some other minor matters.

But this is a simple form.

The borrower, if interested, filled it out.
It was then examined by a bank employee, and, if
satisfactory, the premium was collected or added to the amount
of his loav.

The bank.employee then made out and delivered to

the borrower a certificate of insurance.
of those in the record,.

And there are copies

Well, there are a number of exhibits,

and I assume they can be accepted.

It is another very simple

document,
it is important, I think, that at this time the
insurance was effective.

If the borrower had been killed in

traffic or. the way heme from the bank, he was insured, his
loan would be paid off.
The insurances companies which issued these group
policies to the banks received the commissions — well, I

9

should go back a step.
ahca the bank had issued this certificate to the
borrower: it turned over the premium and the papers involved
to the management company, which made appropriate records, and
then forwarded the premium and the appropriate records to the
insurance company„
The insurance company, both Credit Life of Ohio and
American Bankers of Florida, remitted generous commissions,
varying, between 1948 and *54, from 40 to 55 percent of the
premiums involved.
These ware paid to Smith & Sons, the insurance agent

selling or perfecting the insurance? that had been done by the
bank and their employees.
Oddly enough, and for reasons which an executive, a
vice president and treasurer of the management company,
testified he could not recall.

These commissions were not

included in the taxable income of the insurance agency or of
the bank, but of the management company.
as I say, just a blank.

And the testimony is,

The vice president and treasurer

said, !SX just can't remember why it was done that way."
In any event, this was the procedure that went on
from 194G until 1954.
Late in '53, the American National Insurance Company
of Texas approached the holding company with a new plan, a

10
slight variant on the old.
Q

Mr. Brown, could I just ask one detail?

MR. BROWN;

Q

It had noticed —

Certainly,- Your Honor.

What was the difference in tax rate by the

inclusion of those premiums in the management company's return
as di-stingy is* had from the insurance company?

Was this not to

the advantage of
MR. BROWN: Well, there was no insurance company at
that time,. Year Honor? the insurance company is fronted and comes
into being in *54.
Q

But, in any event, it was reported by the

management company —
MR. BROWN:
Q

— at the then corporate rates, I take it?

MR. BROWN:
Q

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Did the government lost by this?

MR. BROWN:

Your Honor, these were all the same

rates| as you know, there is very little graduation in corporate
rates.

The banks, the management company, and the insurance

agency, none was a less corporation in that way.

So that I

,appose, except for a purist, it made no great difference.
There was no revenue difference, necessarily.

There might have

I can’t say, because I haven't the returns before me.

Tor all of those, six years, all of the corporations, possibly
.vnvolved, were ir the roughly 50 percent bracket rather than

in the roughly 22 percent bracket.

But we will accept these

that it may be.
If the management ~™
Q

But you make no point of it, in any event.

MR. BROWN s

If the management company was in the

lower bracket, we are making no point of it, as you suggest.
These, however, as opposed to an insurance company,
are corporations which are taxed all in the same manner of
regular corporations.
Q

But you will tell us later why the government

chose to allocate to the banks rather than to the management
company?
MR. BROWN:

Yes. Well, I can tell you that new. The

management company had no function at all? it just made copies
and forwarded to the
Q

1 know, but any paperwork that was done, it did.

MR. BROWN:
Q

No, that's not correct, Justice White.

Why isn't it?

MR. BROWN:

The employees of the bank were the ones

who filled out the — who supervised —
o

But than they sent it to the management company?

HR. BROWN: For transmission, for making their own
records and transmitting to the insurance company.
;j

I know, but didn't the management company handle

12
the bookkeeping for the bank?
ME, BROWN;

It made records, Your Honor.

It was an

accounting company, but all of the contact with the customers,
the filling out. of the application, the delivery of the
certificate was by bank employees, with the company.
Now, there is an alternative allocation to the
management company.

That's not before the Court, of course,

in this case? and in case it should be remanded, I would be
embarrassed if I stood here and cut the ground from under the
Commissioner.
But to the best of my knowledge 1 have not considered
the management company, and it seems to have been, largely a
transmittal route, keeping its own — perhaps they didn't
have Xerox machines, but they ran these through the Xerox
machine and sent them cm, why, I suppose, the function would
have been performed.
In any event, in 1953, the American National Company
cams in with a new plan.

Xt proposed that it be the prime

underwriter on credit life insurance,

However, that the

holding company form a Subsidiary and that the subsidiary
ro-insur* all these risks.

American National had noted that

financial institutions were forming their own subsidiaries or
af filiated insurance companies.

And the record indicates it

wonted to keep what business it could.
do it suggested that for a fee if would supply

13
accounting services, some record keeping,, the insurance company
record keeping, actuarial, services, the staff work of an
insurance company.

But this would be for a fee, and then it

would re-insure all these risks with this subsidiary to be
formed, so that the risk was then shifted.
Q

Well, who's doing all this paperwork?

MR. BROWN; Well, I suppose the lawyers did the drafting
of the documents, Your Honor, but —
Q

Well, but the reinsurance, the blanket reinsur­

ance policy doesn’t take care of all the paperwork.
MR. BROWN:

No.

No,

No.

Well, we are told by the

record that this was apparently done, mostly by American
National.

The findings are that other than the payment of

looses, the bank charges, and taxes, that the newly formed re­
insurance company had little in the way of expenses.

Indeed,

the findings of the Tax Court, which set out the expenses had,
show a very minute figure there.
So it was — I think I don’t exaggerate if I say it
was largely passive.

It had investment problems, of course,

because it had substantial funds.
Q

Has the Comptroller taken any position, on this

advantage?
MR, BROWN:

The Comptroller has come ----- we are coming,

Justice Douglas, to the question of the authority of banks to
participate.

The Comptroller has taken the position that a bank

14
me:y, as an incident to its lending function, handle insurance»
Now, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, in the Sanson
ca'-r. which i,-3 cited in both briefs, held that this was
improper and invalidated the ruling of the Comptroller, and
enjoined the. banks from participating in the selling of
insurance.
Q

Well, the statute forbids banks from what?

Being in the insurance business or participating —
MR. BROWN:
The statute

No, Your Honor, this is very peculiar.

we have no statute at all that does anything.

There is this 1916 statute which says that national banks in a
small town may be insurance agents.
Now. the Comptroller says, Well, that's general
business; he doesn't view that the banks can be in the
general; but they can assist their own lending functions.
The taxpayers

and perhaps properly, I don’t think we have

to ask the Court for a decision on that banking question *—
the taxpayers read that statute, or part of that statute,
because this is one of the curious aspects, as though it said
banks in small towns and only banks in small towns may do the
following thing.
They, then, stress the thing, the section that says
banks may receive commissions. They don’t mention the fact
that the statute also says that banks may collect premiums and
sell insu

end act generally. The banks in this case

15
clearly effectuated the insurance.
However.. this was put into operation.

Security Life

was formed;, with a capital of $25,000, paid-in surplus of
$.12,500; $37,500 net worth.

At the end of the year it was

reinsuring risks of over $6 million; at the end of '59 it was
reinsuring risks of over $41 million.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

I think wa will pick up

after lunch with that.
[Whereupon, at 12s00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at Is00 p.m.„ the same day.]

16
AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:00 p oHi a J
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
continue.

Mr. Brovm, you may

Lou have nine more minutes, total remaining time.
MR. BROWN:

Your Honors, as I was pointing out,

beginning in 1954, the banks remitted premiums to American
National.

It kept some 13.3 percent of those premiums for

its fees, the remaining 86.5 were remitted to Security Life.
This business was very profitable for Security Life,
with a net worth of $37,500 at the outset in "54; by the and
of 1959, it had a net worth of $850,000, and it paid a $389,000
dividend.
So in five years, with a capitalization or original
net worth of $37,500, it had profits, after reserves, and
after expenses, of $1,200,000.
The Commissioner allocated 40 percent of the premiums
then the banks, on the theory that the banks had performed, the
services which resulted in the insurance, they had effectuated
the insurance, and that the market demonstrated that commis­
sions of a minimum of 40 percent were allocable.
On these facts, it would be very difficult even, I
think, to raise a substantial question.
Q

But the Tar Court —

Could the bank have lawfully charged and

received and kept the 40 percent commission at that time?
BROWN: Wall, that's the next question, Mr. Chief

17
Justice»
Q

Excuse me.

MR. BROWN; The taxpayers make the point that

and

they repeat it frequently in their briefs — that the banks
could not receive these commissions*
And, as I was pointing out in answer to Justice
Douglas* question, and Justice White suggested, this is
considerably more complicated than that»

The only statute is

one that permits banks in small towns to engage in general
insurance agencies»
The Comptroller of the Currency believes, and has
ruled, that this type of transaction is perfectly proper for
banks.

However, the Fifth Circuit has enjoined the banks;

from participating in just this type of transaction.
It's interesting that the Fifth Circuit, and there is
a substantial question of standing because the suit was brought
by insurance agents, the Fifth Circuit ruled, surveying a
fairly lengthy statutory history and more of what. Congress had
failed to do than what it had done, that there was an
inhibition on the banks and that this was to protect insurance
agencies, t© avoid competition by banks with insurance agents.
Well, 1 think it's clear that what the banks did here
ousted insurance agents of a substantial business.

It's not

our point aither to exonerate or indict the banks for what they
did, but only to describe what they did.

18

So even if you taka the statute, as I suggested
earlier# that authorises small town banks to act as agents# to
sell insurance# to collect premiums# and then to receive
commissions# it seems to me a peculiarly narrow reading to
focus only on the receiving commissions.

The banks effectuated

this insurance.
Now# it's not for me to say whether they were
insurance —
Q

Well# let's assume the statute does forbid the

banks —
MR. BROWN:
Q

—- from collecting premiums,

MR. BROWN;
Q

Yes# sir.

Yes.

You make your argument# in spite of that, under

the —
MR, BROWN:
Q

Yes.

Yes.

y-.R„ BROWN:

And that's on any ground# whether, it

seems to me# this is correct.
Do you come to the same result on both Sections
61 and 482 in that respect?
MR. BROWN:

No# Your Honor, I think not,

I think

under — if it had involved the years before '54 we would have,
As Judge Friendly pointed out on 61# this Court’s decision in

Usually that's an all-or-nothing.

Mow, we wouldn't claim that all the payments to the
life insurance company were income tothe banks, because the
life insurance company did perform the function of reinsuring
these risks.

It was a minimum capital, but it did that.

So here 482 provides for allocation, as is often
required, analysis of prices, of services.

Judge Friendly's opinion in the Rubin case,

which is cited, makes a point of that.
So we would — I don't know, I shouldn't say that

It presumes that there

It doesn't a3k the bank to receive the

money, but it says the bank is taxable as though it had.
That's been true since Lucas v. Earl.
So that I don't think that makes any difference, and
I would like to demonstrate this.

I think two simple cases

i

would demonstrate that even if this prohibition on receipt
ware verbatim in the statute, as indeed it was in Local
Finance, the Indiana statute was there; quite explicit.
But two simple cases. The first, let's take a public
officer, a purchasing agent, and let's make it federal since
it'd a federal statute, and some point, is made of that.

He is

20
prohibited by statute, we will say, from receiving any funds
or moneys from any person with whom he deals.

A person who

deals with his office customarily and. would like more business
than he's been able to get approaches him and offers him a
substantial sum of money»

He says, "I can't take it? the lav;

And then he remarks, "I have a son in college,

he could certainly use some extra money? he’s always complaining
that, he doesn't have enough»w
The visitor thinks he understands what's been said,
and promptly mails a check to the son at college, who inquires
of his father and is told to keep it»
Now, I assume there would be no question that's
income to the father.
Let's bring it a step closer to this case, in fact,
I would say almost identical with this case.

Instead of the

son in college, the purchasing officer says, "No, I can't take
your money."

Arad the conversation goes on, and then he

indicates he'd inherited an orchard a few years back, he had
incorporated it, his farm is incorporated, and they sell the
produce»

he's interested in acquiring apples and peaches and says,
"I will pay Farms Incorporated a price", which is obviously
far above the market.

The price is accepted.

I think there can be no question that, though the
statute prohibits the officer from receiving these funds,
that 482 would allow the Commissioner to allocate that money
to him.
the Fifth Circuit has had no difficulty where
purchasing officers who, in such oblique fashion, had funds
paid to their nominees.
So that seems to me is this case.

They performed a valuable

The Commissioner and the Tax Court

reviewing him decided that it was highly appropriate that the
market value of this function be allocated to the banks.
1 would like to reserve, if I may, such remaining
time as I have, Mr. Chief Justice.
bR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Brown.

Mr. Anderson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN H. ANDERSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ANDERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question as far as these national banks in Salt
Lake City, Utah, and Boise, Idaho, are concerned is whether or
net the CcD.vaissioner of Internal Revenue, purporting to use the

22
authority of Sect:!on 482 of the Internal Revenue Coda,, can
allocate to than insurance-related income which the banks
neither received nor could lawfully receive, thus resulting in
a tax where there is no income, and could never be any income,
and will never be any income, notwithstanding any outcome of
this case.
Che Corralssioner's position in this case is wrong for
a number of reasons.

It is wrong, so wrong, that commentators

across the country have uniformly criticized it.

Referring

to this specific case, we've cited two of those articles in our
brief:

one is currently a review of an address given at. the

?
Chicago Tax institute.
9 of our brief.

It's Mr. Clan's

article cited on page

It attempts to overturn all applicable

precedent in the area, with the sole exception, the sole
aberration of Local Finance.
And I might add fcc the Court, and I'm sure the Court
has probably already picked this up from the briefs, that both
courts below in this case were in favor of the taxpayer's
position.

Judge Fay, who is in the courtroom today, I under­

stand; Judge Fay, after hearing our case, dissented in Local
Finance.

And then seeing that — feeling that he was bound by

Local Finance, ruled against the taxpayer in the Tax Court.
In addition, Your Honors, and I understand this is
corr at, that the Comptroller of the Currency has made his
opposition to the Internal Revenue Service's position known?

23
I'm informed that that’s correct.

And a copy of the letter

which he sent to the Solicitor General’s office has been made
available to these member national banks.

In the letter, the

Comptroller of the Currency asks the Solicitor General to make
his views known to this Court, that the Comptroller opposed
the Internal Revenue Service's position.
I an not sure that that point was adequately made.
I might request that it, would be helpful for the Court to have
a copy of the Comptroller's views attached to the record for
review.
Q

Mr. Anderson,, in these remarks you made, are

you attacking the implementation of Section 484 or the
section itself?
MR. ANDERSON: The implementation.
Q

You're not questioning the integrity of it as a

tool .in the tax structure?
MR. ANDERSON:

No, Your Honor.

The errors which we question -- pardon me.
3

What would be your position if an officer of

the bank had received or had embezzled income, and instead of
keeping it himself, had placed it in the bank, and the bank
in sate way was responsible for it, would the bank be taxable
cn that embezzled income?
MR. ANDERSON:
income?

You say the employee embezzled the

24
Q

Yes,

ME. ANDERSON?

No.

We would say the bank would not

be taxable, the eirplcyoe would.

That is the James case,, citet

at pages 29 and 30 of the government’s brief.

And that's 180

degrees, we submit, from the present situation.
There, in that case, illegal income was actually
received.

In this case, illegal income was not received

because it would be illegal to .take it.
Q

Wall, the distinction you draw, then, is only

in the fact of receipt —
MR.. ANDERSONs
Q

That’s correct, Your Honor.

not in the fact of illegality.

MR. ANDERSON: Well, it is correct, the fact of
receipt is the controlling distinction? the .illegality, in this
case, goes further to buttress other points that we would make.
On the example you gave, it is the fact of receipt;
that is correct.
We submit that the errors in the government's posi­
tion — and there are a number of them, and I'll go through at
Xo :.st three main errors in the government's position

all

find themselves bottomed on one main circumstance, which we
don't think has been adequately represented to the Court.
For nearly a quarter of a century, these banks have
made credit life, health, and accident insurance available to
their borrowers.

And, we might add, that their contact with

25
this insurance was so small that it cost the banks, for the
activity c

ell of their branches and all of their personnel,

less than 12,000 a year per bank to process the insurance
characterised by both courts below as negligible.
Q

Well, then, at that point, let me ask you this --

ME. ANDERSON: Excuse me,
Q

Yes,

If you should lose, by chance, on this argument,

are you also attacking the allocation itself, percentagewise?
MR. ANDERSONs We surely are, Your Honor.
Q

All right.

Q

Now, what is the relationship between the $2,000

figure you just mentioned and whatever percentage override was
charged by the bank for handling, the service charge? how much
did that amount to?
MR. ANDERSONs
points of our case.

Your Honor, that is one of the main

The banks charge nothing.

The banks

received a substantial benefit just by having insurance
available on the premises.

As a matter of fact, the record

shows that over one-half million dollars in bank loans were
paid off by the discharge of this insurance on people who died.
And the banks charged — the banks received their benefit in
that fashion,
V

Well, w.\-.snct there some service charge that the

bank received just for the paperwork?
MR. ANDERSON:

No, Your Honor.

The banks' paperwork

26

mis
that's t.he 11 or .11.5 percent figure that —

American national Life Insurance Company for servicing the
insurance tor — rail, if :: could draw the diagram this ways
Here would be the banks, here is their holding
company,, here is the sister life insurance company, -Security
Life until '59*

American National was an independent, unrelated

insurer up here.

The insurance went from American National

through a group policy in the banks to the borrowers.

And the

obligation was between the borrower and American National.
Then American National reinsured the risk, $41 million
worth by 639, reinsured the risk down to Security Life, and did
all of the actuarial work for Security Life and charged 11 centsr
actually it's 3.5 cents, charged Security Life that much, and
then remitted to Security Life the balance.
Q

But if — except for the fact that Security Life

was a sister corporation, I suppose that Security Life would
have had to pay out to somebody a commission?
MR. ANDERSON; That is another main point of our case.
No,

The amicus brief in this case — first, let me — may I

make just two points on that?
The amicus brief in this case sets up the situation
which we, arguendo, tried to point out in our brief, and that
is that tho Commissioner has had a basic underlying fallacy in

his reasoning..

He says that in an unrelated, uncontrolled

situation, a commission would be paid»
Q

Yes o

MR. ANDERSONs

In the amicus situation, for many, many

years the automobile dealers in Michigan made available credit
life, health, and accident insurance in connection with GMR.C
financing, and they took no commissions, nor did any related
entity or person take any commission; but GMAC kept 100 percent
of the premiums paid.

The reason for that being that it was

against the law for the automobile dealers in Michigan to
receive the commission.
Q

That’s point No, 1,

Well, that may be so, but this family of corpor­

ations, when they were buying credit life insurance independently
made sure that there was somebody in its family that would take
the commission, the Smith Agency, which then gave it to the
management company; is that right?
MR, ANDERSON:
Q

Yes, you * re entirely correct.

They ’weren't about to return 40 percent or 50

percent of the premiums to the life insurance company when
somebody in their family could collect it; right?
MR. ANDERSON: That's the key phrase, when somebody
in their family could collect it; and that is correct.

As

firmly established in — excuse me.
Q

Why did the Smith Agency turn the money over to

the management company in the years gone by?

28

MR* ANDERSONs

In the original years, 1948 to *54,

the testimony is on the record that the income was so small
that it just virtually passed notice, it should have been taken
in income by Smith; it was taken into income by the management
company.

And when asked in testimony, the executive vice

president said it just escaped notice.

It was a mistake.

But as firmly embedded in the tax law as any
principle the Commissioner cites here is the principle
established by this Court in Molina Properties f in National
Carbide, and in other cases, that the taxpayers may structure
their affairs any way they please, notwithstanding that the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue doesn't like the structure.
And you're right. Your Honor, so long as lawfully
some related entity could take this money, then the holding
c ompany was anxious for the entity to take the money.
But the very bottom fact, of this case, and I submit
the Commissioner hasn't shown anything contrary, the very
bottom fact of this case, if I haven't made any point at all
whil-n I'm up here, is this point:

that if that bank in

Suit Lake City or in Boise was completely isolated from any
ether related, entity, on a desert island or some pi nee, doing
business, and there was no related entity, that it would not
take these commissions, because it’s a violation of the federal
banking law so to do.
Tkw penalties for violation of that federal banking

29
law ara very severe.

Their loss of the corporation’s banking

franchise, and criminal liability on the part of the directors.
Now, this is no closely held tiny, little group that
served to profit —- of people that served to profit by devices
or contrivances, these are national banks, publicly owned
through holding companies.

The directors of these banks have

no personal stake in this.

They were trying to abide by the

law.

The law said the banks could not take this income, and

again 1 can't — excuse me.
1

But it was profitable

I'm not saying there is

anything wrong with this ~~ but it was profitable to form the
intra-family insurance company which could take 89 percent of
the premiums, or 83 percent of the premiums and be taxed at
insurance company tax rates.
MS. ANDERSON; By all means.
Q

Yes.

It was profitable, which — and without

doing that, it would have retained 40 percent less the premiums?
MRANDERSON;
1

Yes, sir.

And has the tax law been amended to tax insurance

companies on chess premiums?
MR» ANDERSON;

It has, Your Honor.

In 1959, the tax

the income tax — the Life Insurance Tax Act was passed,
the lower court, Judge Pay, referred to that.

Under that law

the insurance companies are taxed at exactly the same rate as
any other corporation; the only difference is that because of

30

reserves, which mat be set up to protect the policyholders,
ibxt the timing is slightly different, but the full corporate
rates apply.

the only thing that * s different is timing.

But l again — I must emphasise this point.

If I

sit down with no point made, it must be this point — but this
point, it must be this point.
And that is that these banks would not take commis­
sions illegally, notwithstanding the outcome of this case,
notwithstanding anything that would happen, these banks will'
not take insurance-related income.

The record shows that they

have been advised by counsel not to take that income.
firm gave that advice.

Our law

The advice will be honored, and they

will not take that income.
The only thing that the Commissioner could achieve
in this case would be the unheard-of result of taxing these
banks, exacting a tax out of the treasury of these banks when
there is no income that, the banks can get their hands on, ever.
Thus there would be a tax without income.
Q

But there is —

MR, ANDERSON:
Q

Ever.

Yes, Ycur Honor?

— income which the ultimate owners can get their

hands on?
MR. ANDERSON:

Now, that's another good point.

government infers in its brief that somehow all of this is
mushed together, and the income is there to be paid down.

The

Company Act of 1936, was spun off to a new holding company
groupv

ti.c record shows, at page 51, that after that, spinoff,

tha dividend which Mr. Brown referred to was paid up to the new
parent.

The record also shows that there was a developing

difference in the shareholders of those corporations, so that
by 1967 they were substantially different.
Mow, the Commissioner points out in his Reply Brief,
and raises an implication that I!m glad is raised, because we
haven81 been able to get to the point, feeling the record was
closed? but he implies in his Reply Brief that when these two
entities were reconsolidated back in 1970 that somehow this
money came back in.
q

That’s not so.

Well, let’s assume that the banking laws were

amended so it was perfectly clear that a bank could in
connection with writing <— with generating credit life
insurance

take a commission.
MR. ANDERSON;
Q

One-half of my argument would fall.

And then let’s assume that the bank, these

banks continued not to take a commission, although, in terms of
the service it performed, they would have been entitled to it,
and they let the income instead be retained by the life
insurance — the family life insurance company.
you have the same argument under 482?

Then would

32

y would have one-half of ray arc?want „

One-half -would fall —
Q

Which half is it?

MR. ANDERSON?
Q

The half —

No receipt?

MR. ANDERSONThen we would get .into the earnings,
the amount of allocation, the right of taxpayers to structure
their affairs as they choose? and all of that would have to be
examined.
the first half of ray argument is that we don't even
have to gat \.> that, in this case, because, as I’ll point out
in a minute, under V setion 61 this Court has long held that
the taxpayers will not be taxed unless there's an income.
That's what it's called;
And

an income tax.

well, excuse me, Your Honor, have I finished

answering your question?
Q

That's all right.

Go ahead.

MR. ANDERSON: All right.

Q

I know your time is short.

■2R. ANDERSON;

I just wanted to say this, that it

has always been the la;-;, always, without any deviation.

There

is not one authority that the Commissioner has cited to this
Court, not one.

It has always been the law, that tax is not

exacted unless there has been an actual receipt of money or
the right to receive money.

33

In Harrison vs. Shafner, Lucas vs. Early Corliss vs.
Bowerst Coirgaissioner vs. Glenshaw Glass, and a host of other
cases decided by this Court, that principle is as deeply
embedded in the tax fabric of this country as any there is.
There has never been a case contrary to that.
In Corliss vs. Bowers» this Court said this, it said;
Income is that over which a man has an unfettered command, that
he is free to enjoy at his own option.
In Commiesreicner_ vs_. Glenshaw Glass, this Court
described income as that which is clearly realised, over which
a man has complete dominion.
None of those concepts are present in this case.
I submit that complete dominion, the right to enjoy at. his
own option, unfettered command, clearly realised, are nowhere
in this case? because of the national banking laws the banks
could not take the income, they had no unfettered command,
they had no complete dominion, and, foremost, they had no
option.

They had no option whether or not to take the income.
At the very heart of our tax laws, I submit to the

Court, at the very root of it, tax has always followed the
existence in the taxpayer of alternatives — of options.
Q

I suppose that isn't true in the estate tax

side, is it?

In the State tax side, I would —

MR. ANDERSON;

Oh, yes.

Yes, the rule would apply,

Your Honor.
The point is well made that at the time of death the
way the estate tax law operates is that — I think it's
Section, whet is it, 2036?

The way the estate tax operates is

that a man must have held the right at his death to exercise
ownership and control.

developed out of that concept, that at the man’s death he had
the right to exercise dominion over the property.

in the future?

35
MR. ANDERSON;

Yes, Your Honor»

Lucas vs.

or

Helvering vs. Horst.
Q

And certainly there is no right at the time the;,

those coupons nature to receive them.
MR. ANDERSON: The critical distinction, and we cite
Hel--eying vsIlorst in the brief, and we would cite the
contemplation of death, is that at some point the taxpayer had
he had dominion, he had the right to exercise dominion.
That"s the same with the gift in contemplation of death.

At

some point in time, Your Honor, the taxpayer either had the
right to exercise dominion or, in fact, exercised dominion
over the money.
Now, that's different? 100 degrees different from our
case,
In our case there has been no right, there has been
no dominion, there has been no exercise of dominion, and can
be no exercise of dominion, at any time. That is the critical
distinction.

That is why the government's position is in

direct collision with precepts undeviatingly perpetuated by
this Court.

It is in direct collision with those precepts,

without the citation of authority.

Rather, it overturns all

applicable precedent, which we have cited and discussed in our
brief.
Mow, this is a tax case.
things.

Taxes are complicated

They, themselves, adhere to and follow a statute.

36

X:n this case it's Section. 482.

We submit the error of the

Commissioner3s positionf as Mr. Justice Blackman pointed out,
is in the i’rplorr-sritation of the Commis sioney's position on
the statute.
There are two controlling factors under Section 482.
New, the government has made known a number of things.

It

has talked about money and controlled entities and such, but
it hasn't gotten to the statute.

The statute says that it

will operate where a controlling entity, in this case the
holding company, has the power arbitrarily to tamper with the
income, understate the income of one of these controlled
entities„
And when the holding company comes in and tampers
with the income of this entity, in favor of this entity, when
it arbitrarily shifts the income, then the Commissioner may
come in and examine that situation.

We don't have that here.

Stated in terns of this case, the holding company
Y7ould have to have the right to effect the banks to take the
insurance income.

But no such right exists, because the

banks would not operate in violation of the law.
The very fundamental premise upon which Section 482
operates is absent in this case.

There is no control element

which can arbitrarily shift income.

The government *s position

dies at the very threshold.
The second home upon which Section 482 operates is

37

in subsection (c) of Section — of Regulation Section 1.482-1
(cj, and it's in the government8s brief, in the Appendix.
And that states the frontiers of the Commissioner*s authority.
The vary frontiers of his authority are stated in that
regulation.
The regulation says something like this;

The

authority of the Commissioner to allocate, to take an action
under this section — and then, in effect, goes on to say;
is limited to those situations — and this is the key phrase —
those situations where the income of the taxpayer would have
been different in an uncontrolled situation from that in a
cont.rolied situation.
Now, if the income of the taxpayer is no different in
an uncontrolled situation, how can the Commissioner exercise
authority in a controlled situation?
That test was applied by the Court of Appeals in this
case, and not repudiated by the Commissioner in this case? it
applies to this case, and the answer to it, as found by both
courts below, is that these national banks, in an uncontrolled
situation, would not receive the type of income which the
Commissioner tries to allocate to them.

38
HR, AKDERSONBoth, Your Honor, but since this Court
granted certiorari, 1 did not develop any argument on the
differences»

In Local Finance, for instance, all the finance

company officers were licensed insurance agents. And when they

sold insurance.

They also solicited very heavily, 95 percent

took insurance.

Local Finance to handle the insurance was much greater, and sc
OB e

But all of the cases„ with the sole aberration of
Local Finance, if it does apply in some way, all of the cases
are against the Commissioner.
May i call the Court’s attention to three rules of
laws

one is the Shurik case, the only applicable precedent in

this area when these taxpayers were trying to fix their
affairs up.

Ws cite it in our brief and discuss it.

In that

case, because of GPA price regulations, a manufacturer could
not raise prices to its wholly controlled wholesaler.

The

Commissioner came in and tried to allocate income back, and
the Tax Court said:

We will not tax a taxpayer who neither

had the si-a? to receive the income nor received the income.
That * s precisely or the point of this case,

39

The Commissioner himself has recognised this.

In the

current v/age-price freeze that President Nixon embarked upon
last fall, the Commissioner, in Technical Information Release
1106, issued to the public, said that where the public, because
of strictures of the law under this current wage-price freeze,
where corporations did not pay out dividends and accumulated
earnings, so that there might be otherwise a violation of
Section 531 of the Coda, that the Commissioner would not come
in and exact a penalty tax.

Because the taxpayer was prevented

by law from doing something — from distributing the money out.
The Commissioner himself has taken the position
that he must follow the tenets of the law in other areas.
tax law does not operate in a vacuum.

The

Congress did not pass

the banking lew and the tax law to operate independently of
one another, but, rather, to operate in a harmonious, coopera­
tive whole.
If a rule is going to be established affecting all
of the regulated industries of banking and insurance, the
insurance industries, Congress should do it, so the taxpayers
could do it prospectively and not be penalized.
Q

Well, what if the allocation had been to the

management company?

Same answer?

n, ANDERSON:

No, Your Honor.

Then I’d be back to

the other half of my case.

I might add that the Commissioner has -- well, X

won't add that.
There is no income.

is no income from which to discharge this tax.
flowed out in the 1959 reorganization.

That income

It is gone.

It will

never come back.
There will never be any income from which to discharge
the tax the Commissioner seeks to exact here.

Never,

These taxpayers are in a position of this kind of a
dilemmas

either, one, they pay the tax where there's no

income , ad infinitum, thus affecting the financial soundness
of these national banks as opposed now by the Comptroller of
the Currency in this Courts or, two, take the income, violate
the federal banking law, and risk forfeiture of their charter,
and criminal liabilities on the part of their directors? or,
three, give up insurance altogether.
\

Now, we submit the taxing law has never been that
unreasonable»
Q

There is another alternative, isn't there?

MR, ANDERSON:
Q

You're right.

Perhaps — let me put it this way;

Is there

anything illegal about their not charging any commission at
all and just charging their customers the net., roughly one-half
of the premium, and thereby getting all the banking business
in that town by cutting the total cost to the borrower?
Ml. ANDERSON:

Well, Your Honor, the banks can't set

41
the rates.

a matter ox fact, the independent insurance

companies would be very jealous of a situation where one bank
on this corner was charging one rate and another bank on this
corner was charging another, because it would throw all of its
customers into chaos.
The testimony in the record is that the banks had
nothing to do with-'the rates.

But assuming, arguendo, that

they did, if 1 may answer just a second further — assuming,
arguendo, they did, the testimony in this record, uncontra­
dicted , is that there*s no such thing as a set part of a premium
rate which is commission«
of troubled waters.

And so the banks would never be out

The Commissioner could always come in.

Ik, rate could be so low that an independent insurance company

out here could be losing money, they could still choose to
pay a commission.

So the banks would always exist in jeopardy

of the Commissioner9s caprice to corns in and say, Ah ha., there’s
so much commission, we allocate it to you, lose your franchise.
«

No, there wouldn’t be any way.

substantial difference whether the banks or the insurance
company is paying the tax?

trying to reallocate to the banks has already been taxed at
some rate, in seine amount,on the insurance company?

the life insurance companies were not subject to a tax, and it
has not been taxed, no, sir.

Perhaps the boards were the same, or overlapping.

Wouldn't that make a difference?
MR. BROWN; The statute doesn’t require, of course,
identical, it requires common control of 50 percent.

frustrate the use of 482 for the years when there is common
