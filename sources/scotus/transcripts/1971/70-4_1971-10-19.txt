Mil, CHIOS' JUSTICE BURGER:

Vie will hear arguments

nest in No# 4, Reed against Reed#
(discussion off the record ,)
MR# CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. derr, you may

proceed,
URAL'ARGUMENT OF ALLEN R# oERR, ESQ.,

UN BEHAIS' OF THE APFELIANT
MR# PEER:

Mr. -Chief Justice, Your Honors.-may it

. • Iea: ■ e the 0ourt:
Wc are here today to ask you to do something that
it-.is Court has never done since the Fourteenth Amendment was
adopted In 1868, and that is to declare a State statute that
distinguishes between — that classifies between males and
feesles as unsonstitutional•»
Vie feel that the case could have as

at least

a significant — significance for women -somewhat akin to what
Brown v. Board of Education had for the Colored people.
Q

We had a case some years back involving

qualifications of a bartender in Michigan.
MR. x/E.RR:

if the Court please., that was the

srsec; rt case that you ore talking about, sir.
u

I f era:at the name of it „

MR., JU.6RR:

To at caserns decided , Your Honor, on a

premise that we feel is no longer tenable#

It allowed the

4
wife or daughter of an owner to tend bar, but no other women
to tend bar.

It seemed to have been felt by the Court that

if the — that the -wife or daughter would be protected by
the husband or father, and that for some ofehe ' reason there
was a rational relationship to legitimate State'purpose,
Mow this rational relationship test that has
followed through our law has given come indication that
wherever there has bean a classification on the basis of sex,
anything goes — it *s ail right*

And we admit they are dif­

ferent, tout we do feel that the result of this rational rela­
tionship test is almost as bad as the sepearafce but equal tesi
of Piesay v, Ferguson, holding back women from being con­
sidered persons, end holding them back from their entitle­
ments under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States
Constit ution, the Equal Protection clauses.
How Just a brief rundown on the facto of this case

which might be helpful in our analyzing it,
Q

In this connection, could the Idaho Court-

have appointed Mr, and Mrs, Reed as Joint Administrators?
MR, DERR:

There is a serious question tn my mind

because of the mandatory provisions.

In our Supreme Court in

the case we are appealing from said that provision is manda­
tory.
Q

Well, what is the practical aspect in the day

to day routine of the Idaho Probate Court?

Do they do this?

MR* DEER;

I have not known them, personally, in

my practice, to have done so except by assent and never in
this type of equal relationship*
I'have had a brother and sister agree with each
other, but it seems fco me that any time a stale contender
appears under this statute that the language of the statute
is clef v: males nus . be

preferred to females.

There is no

discretion.
Q

ho that a Court, in your view then, may not

appoint both, even though it *s inclined to do so and even
though both agree,
JSR, EERR:

1 would think that the interpretation

that was given to this case is the interpretation that might
i

be-given by other Courts and that no, they wouldn't appoint
them.
Q.

ones this statute take up whatever to what

a man and woman apply and they .are just equally entitled in
j

terms of the class they are in?
MR. a i ERR:
Q

Is that where it picks up?

MR. CERE:
0

Yes, 3ir,

That‘s where it picks up,

Because it says equally entitled and you might

say that before the statute makes the choice there would have
to foe a hearing as tc «hat the respective'qualifications are
for this is two people'and it would only be when they are

6
found to be absolutely equally qualified to act that the
•statute would make a choice, but 1 gather that’s not the way
it works«
MR. DERR:

It isn’t the way .1 read it.

Equally

■f

entitled, there is another section of the Idaho Code that
points out, for Instance, husbands and wives.

In this case,

it is an ex-husband and ex-wifeOr if they were brothers
or sisters

it’s the degree of affinity to the decedent.
Q

But, excuse me, let’s assume now that two

people apply and they Ore in the same category, as you suggest, but then one of them claims that the other is, say.
me ut:' 11 y d e f ec t i v e,
MR, I'ERR:

There would have to be a he- ■a ring on that

subject,
Q

Well, let's assume there are two people in

that category and one of them says, "I am better qualified
than the other."
MR. DERR:

Perhaps a determination of the judge -*■•-

well, except for this mandatory statute, that’s really coming
back, Justice White, to what we are talking about.

Let the

Court
Q

Well, what about the mentally defective case,

then ?
•rk, IE HR:
merits,

Let the Court decide on the basis of the

7
Q

Exactly» but let’s assume one person says the

other person is deaf ancl dumb, or he’s paralized, something
lilce that, and is unqualified to act as an administrator or
an executor®
M39 DERR:
be sufficient.
Q

I don’t think the bear assertion would

There would have to be proof.
Well, what if the person happens to be a man2

The woman says the. man is paralized., and he says, ’’Well. I,
get the appointment anyway because I am in the same category
as you,"
E4R0 TERR:
*Q

They do have to determine these factors»

Well, then you are conceding that there is a

determination of comparative aptitude within the scope of the
statute?
MRo DERR:

No, jour Honor, there is not.

xcept when somebody alleges the other fellow
is disqualified?

Paralysis or something —
.1:

They would probably have to have a

hearing and proof.
Q
,; - te

Are you spying th.it a drunken husband has the

, ; • fc over an able, competent, breadwinning ’wife?
MR, DERR:

Unless the wife is able to come in and

convince the Court that he is »~
Q

Well, has she got vie right to do it?

is what we are asking.

This

8
MR* .'iERR:
Q

That via3 my question,

MR, TERR:
Q

We have to read our statutes in —

Together, right,

The parties were making other statutes that

disqualify anybody, man or woman, if he’s deaf, dumb and blind
or if he’s seven years old or if he’s a multiple amputee,
or so on, but we are dealing with this statute and we must
take it as it’s interpreted by the Supreme Court of the State,
and the State has interpreted the statute very clearly, has it
not?
MR, jjiiiRR:
Q

Yes, Your Honor

Well, more than that, 1 gather that there

has not been any claim by either this lady or this gentleman
suffer... any disability.
MR, TERR:

The record shows no what

no such

clair
Q■

That no such claim has been made,

MR, TERR:
Q
entitled,

Ho such claim,

All that has happened here is ~~ equally

I gather, is that they are in the degree of con­

sanguinity, whatever it is, which would make them equally
entitled, and the statute then operates to compel the appoint-

ment of the msle,
MR,

wRR:

This is exactly why we are here.

Mow, Sally Reed

Q

But I wish to get your position entirely clear.

You are saying, in effect, X take It, that a hearing is not
in order, that the statute is mandatory.
MRa DERR:

The statute is mandatory but I am not

closinr the door to someone being able to have a hearing, but
let iAC run down the only other disqualifications in our
statute:

nonresidents, minors, persons convicted of an

infamous crime and persons incompetent by reason of drunken­
ness, improvidence or want of understanding or integrity,
however those are defined,
Q

Want of understanding — if that's claimed.

It has to be claimed,
MR, YiSRR:
Q

And it’s not. at least in this case,

MR, YERR:
Q

It has fee be claimed,

True,

Well, did you make an attempt to claim it on

behalf of your client?

MR, YERR:

do, we did not, because we felt that our

client — my client was better qualified to administer the
estate for many reasons, none of these particular disqualifi­
cations came into play,
Q

But you made no attempt to display her

qualifications other.-.;ise?
MR. DERR:

We had no opportunity to.

Vie

petitioned, the husband petitioned, the judge issued his order

because of this law in Idaho the man gets the job»
Vie didn't get a chance to show our client was
better educated, for instance, that she had had bookkeeping
experience, that she had had secretarial experience»
Q

i>id you make an offer of proof?

MR. DERR:
Q

Ho, Your Honor»

X don't think I've got this clear yet, from

some confusion in the answers„
What was to prevent you from presenting the
issue i;o the Court, as an issue, that the wife was better
qualified* anything except the statute and Its mandatory
preference in your way?
HR. HERR:

The statute and its mandatory preference

was enclosed and, as a matter of fact, I don't think there
was even a hearing at all* was there?
VOICE:

Yes, there was a hearing,

MR. HERR:
VOICE:

Was there?

Yes, there was a hearing before Probate

Court,
MR. i.iERR:

v.as

That lb was perfunctory and the decision

based strictly on this statute.
Q

The hearing just established that your client

was a 7-Oman and the defendant was a man.
MR, -CeRR:
0

Correct.

inci as the Supreme Court of the State says

11
this is one of those ersas inhere a chelae- must be made and the
Legislature by enacting the statute, made the determination*
Thatfs the way your Supreme Court has construed your statute.,HR* f’hRR:
Q

Yes,, sir,

So we should take this case as though the

parties had conceded that both parties are equally qualified
Q

That neither is incompetent otherwise,

MR, DEHR:

I. would like to use the language neither

is incompetent otherwise,
(Whereupon, at 12:01, p*m„, the argument was
recessed., to reconvene at 1:00 p,m,, the same day,)

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:00 p#m.)
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr, Derr,

You may continue.,

You nave twenty minutes remaining,
MR* *.ERR:

I thought a little bit more about some

questions from over here during the noon hour, as usual,
I presume.
When we had an'automatic disqualification — we have
one Section 15312 that, of course, says that in this case the
woman is equally entitled under the fact structure here, but
when you have an automatic disqualification oho is no longer
equally entitled,
Now the Court does have permission,if two people
are actually equally entitled under the Idaho law* to appoint
one or more.
Q

Is that statute perhaps not to be read as

•manin;., in practical terms, otherwise equally eligible?
uR, EBRR:

Otherwise would be correct.

Otherwise equally eligible, then the male is
preferred over the female.
MR# -DERR:

Uh huh,

but 15314 with its preference

just takes that right out from under on that one,
also as far us the size cf the estate is concerned,
it isn *t in the record but I think the Court should know that
Cecil .Reed was appointed March 12, 1968, as the Administrator,

pursuant to the Probate Court order,, and a bond op $1000
was posted in the ease.
Q

Hasn’t an inventory been filed after three

years?
MH* uBRRs

Ho, Your Honor.

This has been in litigation, and 1 might point out
the Probate Court order which was the subject of the first
appeal and this has been through the appellate process ever

Q

Well, the fact an appeal was pending doesn

prevent or stultify the filing of an inventory -»

M.R, HERR;

I would think not, Your Honor, but in

our unique position we didn't feel vie had — we had neither
the information nor the right , according to the Probate Court
to do that*
Q
files

In other words, you haven't looked at the

the probate file?
MR, *jERR:
0

Yes»

And there is no Inventory,

MR. TERR:

Ho inventory.

As a matter of fact,

Respondent4 a brief admits that "'fact,

■'e think, gentlemen/ that what we’re dealing with
hove ...
;:.r:

v

strictly a '.hr. with sex-based distinction, which die*

s individual ability and capacities and is not

rationally related to the factor of sex, and therefore, vie

Yecu 3/o involves invidious discrimination and is in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment,
Q

That argument has not succeeded in other

contexts in this Court, has it?
i

;

Mil* TERR:
Q

>

You are absolutely correct, Your Honor,

Right to vote, for example?

MR* HERR;

The right to vote, of course, are we

talking about the early cases?
Q

Early eases, yes*

MR* a)ERR:

1 believe that the circumstances that

existed at that time have long since passed.
Q

Also that case did not involve attack under

the equal protection clause-of the Fourteenth Amendment,
MR* TERR:
Q

That is my understanding, Your Honor,

Privileges and immunities,
✓

MR* jjERR:

<•

Right,

And I think that was* if 1 am not mistaken, true
of, wasn’t it Bradwell that denied women the right to practice
law before the turn of the Century,
Since the turn of the Century, the eases that have
come before this Court have ended up in decisions that I felt
have been either supposedly beneficial or .protective, as far
as women are concerned*
Obviously. X can see nothing beneficial in the Idaho
Ir.j, nor can I see anything protective in the Idaho law,

'15
It*8 just a bold-face discrimination against women,
and once that comes up, the door is locked on the woman*

She

might as well go homo, if that lav/ is allowed to stand,
How Idaho tried to justify this law on two points,
one biological and the other practical, and I don't think
either of those points would bear the stiff scrutiny and
justify the action that the State has taken here•
Cj

Vlhat was the basis of the biological justlfi-

cation?
MR, i)ERR:
than women,.

That men are generally better qualified

That’s basically what the Idaho Supreme Court

said, going clear back to the early cases, going back to
Muller, even ttnumastssirjsigins^ast^^'
Gcesaert.

«- mw.-.jg»»wnwwwt ■ ’**• '

And

t

think we've cited a great number

of statistics to show that women comprise 40$ of the labor
market now, roughly they are equivalently educated in the
labor market, and in spite of all this, and because of s«xbased discriminations, we say their income is way below the
income of a man»
Q

That doesn't fit into this case, does it?

Ml» Ii ERR;

It really doesn't*

This isn't an

economic case, except this does, Chief Justice, bring up
another point.

An administrator does get paid and very

little less than the attorney in this State®
our briefs have extensively exhausted the re*
lafcionship between sex-based distinctions and race-based

distinctions *

And as you know, in alienage* in minority

groups.» with respect to indigency in some cases, and at least
in Levy in respect to illsxitlmacy, the strict test has been
applied and these class of cases have- been held not valid *
And with such a large segment of our population as women are,
I certainly don't think it is valid to them»
In other words, what X am saying is I think women

.

are every bit as entitled to the protection of the Fourteenth
Amendment *

They are persons»

The action here is State

actions as aliens, minority groups, indigency, racial
minorities -that did you say is the second Justification?
MR, DERR:

The second justification is the practical

one in which the court said by doing this we'll avoid hearings,
Again, 1 don't think that's sufficient to State
interest to even meet the rational relationship, let alone
the strict approach that would be taken under a suspect

Q

It*s a very recent case, a 1971 case*
Goeoaert could be explained in terms of the

Twenty-first Amendment, could it not?
, MR* DERR;
Q

X presume that ’s possible*

The amendments that repealed prohibition,

then if gave the States, certainly as construed by subsequent
decisions of this Court, a great deal autonomy in the area
of dispensing of alcohol.
■ • A <

vERR:

And that’s why Goesaert probably isn't

••••vporfcivo of the Respondent's position in this case*
There has been a great deal of progress, too, we
light point out-, 1 am sure the Court is well aware of the
progress in Congress with the

Civil Rights Act, the Equal

Fay Act, and some other acts that have come up, and it's
frank truth and a lot of cases are set forth in all briefs
here -that lower courts are disregarding the so-called
oreachings of Muller, Goesaert and Eoyfc,

And, of course,

there is a great factual movement toward bringing women into

18
our society as persons»
;i think the only 'satisfactory solution now is to
treat any classification of women as suspect unless the
classification involves physical characteristics unique to
that sex•. Anything else can get us off into a lot of other
fields.

T think that could solve the situation* could give

guidelines to other

to legislatures -*■* to other courts,

in orcl r to allow a woman to take her full place in our
society, take advantage of the opportunities that are avail*
able, end aiso take the responsibility that always goes with
opportunity.
And 1 don’t think the suspect classification is a
bad classification in the sense, and it could be applied in
this case* X am sure, that if the otafce wishes to disadvantage
anyone, shouldn't the state then

shouldn’t the burden be

on the oppressor instead of the oppressed?

Isn't this a

fundamental principle of fairness?
Q

What if a State had a statute that provided

that if several persons claiming and otherwise equally eligible
to 3d;.in is ter, natural born children shall be preferred over
a d op t eel

:’?R, i>£BR:

I don’t see really any more significance

for a rational basis for that than »*•
Q

Well, do you think that would be bad or good?

X am not sure I follow you*

19
MR* -ERR:
Q

The way -«

Fourteenth Amendment forbid that?

MR* DERR;

X think the way our State treats adopted

children the Fourteenth Amendment would forbid it because
adopted children are given all.the rights and privileges of
naturally born children.
Q

Well, you mean the Fourteenth Amendment as

aided ty. the statutes' of Idaho would make it constitutional,
is that your answer?
MR. DERR:
Q

To distinguish, X don’t think so,

Before going specifically to your statute,

y several persons claiming they are equally entitled to
administer, males must he preferred to females and relatives
of the vdiole to those of the half blood.
Would you :.nke the same argument on behalf of the
as against those who are related to the wfc

:

blood?
MR, j>ERR:

There may be some basis upon which a

State could sustain the half blood as equated with whole

blood relationship*
What would that basis be?

Q

vne

is more closely related than the other,

i s n ' t t ha t c orrec t ?
riRo DERR:
Q

Yes .t

Wouldn’t that be true of adopted children?

20
Just to back into it then.

MR* DERR:

Our statute also prefers in the line

of the right to administer estates brothers over sisters,

he think this is just as tend as — it's a male over female
c las s if ica fc ion *
To summarise, I think corning into the eighth decade
of the 20th Century, that re do have to reexamine the situation
.> :■ os sexual classifications are concerned«

We have to

discord these canards, or canards, however, you pionounce it,
that are not based upon facts.
In Dege,for instance, they were trying to rely on
way back in the early 1800's — ideas, but Holmes set that
at ease, and X think what he said is pretty interesting :
"It is revolting to have no better reason for a
rule of law than that it was laid down in the time of Henry
XVh

It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it

was laid down have vanished long since and the rule simply
aeva;Isis from blind imitation of the past,"

he think if the Idaho rule in this case is allowed

*»

21
to persist, that it will be from blind imitation of the past
and not based upon our current understanding of the Pourteent
Amendment or the facts of today*s society*

Q<<*

Mr. Derr, last term we. had a case involving

It described the crime of escape

end the penalties imposed were if it were a .-women* 11 months,

if. it v.ere a man* 3 years.

Do you think this- Is equally

susceptible to your equal protection argument?
MR, DERR:

Q

I think it is* Your Honor, based on th'os

In reverse?

MR, DERR.;

X agree that the laws have to be applied

equally both ways.
Q

So this would cut across* presumably* all

sorts of imaginable things, alimony, criminal laws about,

rape and prostitution* perhaps?
• MR. DERR:

Ye.

It depends on how you define

of course,
Q

And all sorts•of purported social welfare

distinction to men, such au' in Muller v< Oregon? MR. DERR:

Yes.

Me have a law in Idaho in the

mii irr country that requires them to furnish women with
chairs, but not men,
Q

X think it should be both-or none.

What would you say about Selective Service?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES Ss STOUTt ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR» STOUT:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Respondent, in this case, is an employee of the
i t' a;...: Highway Department *

Ke is a man of moderate means•

is a mechanic, ancl he is about ready to retire-»

Ho

Some asper­

sions have been cast on his character in the argument, it

Bounded like to me, and also in the brief *

He is a man of

good character.
This matter was determined in the Probate Court
of Idaho on adversary petitions.

A hearing was had before,

the Probate Judge, and the matter was open for all the testi­
mony as to the qualifications of each of the applicants.
The Probate Judge determined that the scales, of
Justice v.-ere even on the matter as far as qualifications were
concerned and under the statute, in view of the interpretations
of r

law as interpreted ‘by our Supreme Court on these pref­

erence statutes, and the interpretation that has been made for
a period of one hundred and twenty-five years, over that time,,
he awarded the administration to the male applicant.

He observed in his opinion that the woman was pro­
tected by the order and the man had to qualify by giving.a
bond, and she is protested and —= as in all probate proceedings
all of the heirs are protected.

in this case
Q

Was the decedent an adopted child?

MR* STOUT:

The child was an adopted child, yea,

/

Your Honor»
Q,

And the litigants in this case are divorced,

are they?
MR. STOUT:

Q.

They are divorced, are they?

MR* -STOUT:
v'

They were divorced in 1958*

How old was the decedent at the time?

MR„ STUuT:
Q

They are what?

How old was the child?

Yes,

MR* STUUT:' Sixteen years old,

Q

And in whose custody was he -» the child was

a minor and in whose custody was he?
MR. STUUT:
her husband.

The woman filed a divorce suit against

The district Court awarded the divorce to the
*

husband,

The Court swarded the child, which was of tender

years, to the roman, •The Probate Court of Ada County later
'too;*, it from bar custody and put it in the Children's Home
for r. time and then gave it to the father, and the child was
in the custody of the father at the time of its death.
There are the facts,

1 might say here that the

Probate Court in Idaho at the time this was decided was a
constitutional court*

It is held a court of record by the

25
Supremo Court.

Howe vex*, no reporter’s transcript is

ordina oily made unless the attorneys get a reporter up there
at their own expense.

The practice is not to make one,

.At the beginning of this year, the jurisdiction
was transferred to the district Court under a new judicial
code we have there, which is a court of general jurisdiction,
which is merely background and has nothing to do with the cas
except that's the history of the matter.
In our brief, we’ve raised two questions, one of
which is whether or not there is a substantial Federal
question involved in this case.

The second one assuming that

the Court holds that there is, it is our position that this
.articular statute is not unconstitutional as violating the
equal

'rotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the

Constitution.
Q

Mr, Stout, suppose the statute said that

only mules may be administrators or executors in probate
procedure in the State of Idaho.

Would that violate the

equal protection clause?
MR. STOUT:

X don't believe it would. Your Honor,

because we are talking about a matter of procedure that's
only incidental to the distribution of property.

It has

alwa- - been a matter that’s been legislated on by the States.
The Federal Legislature has never legislated in this field
and I derft believe it would,

You do recognise that, don't you?

MR* STOUT:

What was that?

The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment is in the Constitution, and is mine even in Idaho,
right?
Ml* STOUT:

That's true, Your Honor*

Ana doesn't that prohibit the State of Idaho
from saying that no woman may be —
Q

While you are thinking on that one, let’s

take the more interesting question:

what if the Idaho

Legislature provided that only females could be administratori
or representatives in the estates of decedents, or that they
would be preferred *
MR, STOUT:

problem?

You simply say it is not an equal protection

A State ques tion a

MR, STOUT:

Ho, I don't feel that it is an equal

protec i; ion prob 1 ein,
.In our brief, however, we consider that first
question first, and we cite this new Idaho statute which was
adopted in 1971* last session ©f the Legislature*
Chapter 111 of the Idaho Session Laws of 1971*
a lengthy title, it‘s a lengthy law,

It is

It has got

I've studied it thoroughly in respect to the issues
in this ease.

It's an act relating to affairs of decedents.

Including nonprobate transfers at death of missing persons,
protected persons, minors, incapacitated persons and con­
stituting the uniform probate code.
How that statute enacts an entirely new probate
law for Idaho.

The controversy wasn't over the statutes

that we are arguing about here, it was over the time and
expense of probate proceedings and the design of the statute
as to avoid the proceedings as much as possible.
The statute,does enact a hew probate law and does
repeal, effective next July 1st, the- statutes in the con­
troversy here.

Now we don't claim that that makes this case

practically moot, but it does show the apparent present intent
and attitude of the Idaho Legislature,
Q

Mr, Stout, X asked Mr, Derr whether this new

statute is the result of this litigation.
Do you knew whether it is?

He didn't know.

Whether this litigation has

prompted the adoption of a new code in «—
MR* STOUT;

Q

Is it a .uniform code?

MR. STOUT;

No, X think it had nothing to do with

Yes, X think It had nothing to do with

It has been under consideration for several years there

and I didn't know it was until t got investigating it in this

28

natter here and found that it has.
Are you counsel, for hr. Heed as administrator?
KR„ STOUT:

X am counsel for him, yes, and I

represented him in probate court at the time of the hearing -*
the originali hearing in this case#
Q

Do you have a requirement in your present

code that an inventory be filed by a certain date?
MTU ST'OJT:
Q

Yes,

And has it been filed?

MU, STOUT:

It has hot, because X thought that the

appeal suspended the procedure in the probate court and X
wasn't authorized to file one*
Q

Is that true in your practice?

MR# STOUT:
a

Thetis what X understand it to be,

So an appeal just stops everything?

MR# STOUT:

Yes, I fttgured that stopped us right

there when the appeal was taken.
Q

Creditors can't file claims, or anything?

MR, dTUUT:

I'm not sure about that#

The notice

to creditors was published and I didn't consider that.
o If. lies w er e fi 1 e<3 ♦

No

However, I didn't figure we were justified

In proceeding in the Ratter in view of the appeal status of
the case.
Q

If this had been a. large estate with sub­

stantial investments, could

you have had a special

representative appointed in the interim to deal with problems
pending the resolution of the appeal?
MR* STOUTi

Those under the Idaho statutes are only

appointed where there is some reason for it., like property
is liable bo depreciate or for some purpose.
think there would have boon.
for it here.

Ho, I don’t

There was really no occasion

There was nothing that could depreciate.

This

alloyed bank account., that’s referred to in Sally Reed's
petition and some personal clothing, small amount of
personal property that a minor boy that age would have*
The second point that we have raised under that
is the holdings of this Court, holding that the matter of
probate procedure is a matter for the States to determine,
and the Federal Courts have never* as such, probated estates,

and don’t probate estates.
We have also pointed out in our brief that this

It was enacted in the same statute as this,

It was deleted fifty years ago.

30

In cur briefs, we have cited cases upholding this
statute.

These preference statutes have been upheld by the

Courts every time they have come before the Courts»

back as

far as 1845 in New York. There are a number of Mew York
cases.

There is a California case*

There are two Montana

cases» a recent Idaho case and the constitutionality has
never been questioned before this particular matter here.
So far as women being qualified to act as adminis­
trator in Idaho, they are qualified.

There is no disqualifi­

cation there, except this one statute and the one before that

;h:v:. makes those classifications, that when other things are
equal there is this preference,,
Q

Your position is that men just happen to be

more aiua 1 ?
bR0 STOUT:
Q

Excuse me.

1 didn't ~~-

You said that if they equally qualify the

men get the jobs as administrators.
MR» STOUT:
Q

Yes, that would be right.

ooesn’t that make the men more equal?

MJU STOUT: -The -Court inquired about the basis on
which the Supreme Court decision was made and I will quote
l o,o';; some of the provisions there:
i:This Ob' v-. has before said that the priorities
established by Idaho Cede '15312 are mandatory leaving no
toon-, for discretion by the Court in the appointment- of

31
administrat ox*©»,J citing an Idaho case.

Similarly the preference, given males by Idaho
Code 15314 is also mandatory.

The statute' itself says that

males must be preferred to females.
Other courts,, construing similar provisions have
also held that the preference is mandatory.
The .Respondent, however, contends that Idaho Code
1531^ violates the Fourteenth Amendment, equal protection
clause.
It is well settled that the equal protection clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment does not preclude the legislature
from making classification and ccirawing distinction between
classes.

It merely prohibits classifications which are

arbitrary and capricious.

It is for the court to determine in each instance
'•oti.o •’ ; particular classification rests upon rational grounds
or is in effect without justification and arbitrary.
It is equally well settled that legislative enact*»

•cents ore entitled to a presumption of validity and that a
classification will not be held unconstitutional absent a
clear showing that it is arbitrary and without justification.
By Idaho Code 153i4; the Legislature eliminated two
areas of controversy.

If both the man and woman of' the

same class seek .letters of administration, the male would be
entitled over the female the same as a relative of the whole

blood is entitled over a relative of the same class but of
only the half blood „
Provision of the statute is neither illogical nor
arbitrary method devised by the Legislature to

resolve an

issue that would otherwise require a hearing as to the
relative merits as to which of the two or more petitioning
relatives should be appointed,
Philosophically, it can be argued with some degree
of logic that the provisions cf Idaho Code 1533.4 do dis­
criminate against women on the basis of sew.

However, nature

Itself has established distinction end this statute is not
designed to discriminate, but is only designed to alleviate
the problem of holding hearings for the court to determine
eligibility to administer,
This is one of those areas where a choice must be
made and the Legislature by enacting Idaho Code 15314 made
the determination.
The Legis lature when it enacted this statute

• tvid .-utly concluded that, in general, men are better qualified
to act as an administrator than are women•
.A classification having some reasonable "basis does
not offend against that clause of equal protection* merely
because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because
in practice it results in some inequality.
Ane who assails the classification of such a law

vr..';st carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon
any reasonable basis, but is essentially arbitrary.
And they 30 on to say that while the classification
may not be entirely accurate* ana doubtless there are in­
stances in which it is incorrect, they are not prepared to
say it is completely, without a basis of fact,'.";

as to be ir­

rational and arbitrary*
And then they go on to show what other classification
on the basis of sex have been made*,
It is our opinion that the State has a legitimate
interest in promoting the prompt administration of estates
end that the statute in question promotes this interest by

curto.'.'.ling

litigation over the appointment of administrators,
in addition, it is supported by the presumption of

c. ono t ifcut iona lity „
Appellant, in its brief, has criticised the decision
of the Supreme Court and in its words misquotes it.

They

say, declaring that nature itself has establishedithe dis­
tinction the Idaho Supreme Court seemingly justified the
discrimination challenged here by finding it rational to
assume the mental inferiority of women to men.
They rolled in the mental.

There is no statement

Ass the Supreme .Court decision like that* and the Court
aoc;;;n 1 f think tbs.t *
take it

vcm the passage you read from your

court opinion that you would agree that under the Idaho law
since the purpose of the statute is to avoid hearings about
relative qualifications ~~
MR, STOUT:

In some instancest yes —
that• it wouldn’t do a woman any good to

petition for a hearing on the- grounds that -» I've just had
a lot of experience in business and I'm just better qualified
than the man who has had no experience in business.

It

wouldn’t do her any good to try to get a hearing on that,
fails STOUT:

X think that’s correct»

In the absence

of some disqualification on the part of the man,
Q

On statutory disqualification,

MR, ,STOUT:

We urge that this statute has been in

effect for over 125 years,
100 years in Idaho,

It has been in effect for over

It has been applied by the Courts,

attorneys have followed it and applied it,
I am. a general practitioner*

My business is to

advise clients as to what the law is, what to expect and by
reason of the decisions heretofore made on this law, it is
Xtido enable

to me to assume that I was justified in going

ahead on the basis I cl id

Nqvj the Legislature showed its intention to comply
and to enact £ statute here that more adequately possibly
reflects modern- thought and now that will give the attorneys
some basis to go ahead on, and the people some basis to

proceed on.
Q

But under the old statute, which has now been

superseded, the man would receive the appointment even if
the woman were better qualified to have it«
MR* STOTT:
Q

1 think there is a presumption there ««»

She would never have the chance to show she

was better qualified,
MR6 STOUT:

I think that is correct, yes»

1 think

there is a presumption there based on the general experience
which existed more at the- time the statute was enacted in
*64 than it does now, that men as a rule are better qualified
than the women and on that basis the court didn't hear a
hearing on that particular phase of it»
As I say. the length of time the statute has been
in effect and been followed seem to me should take a very
strong case under this uncertain and elusive provision of
the Fourteenth Amendment to be declared unconstitutional»
It has been acted on.
has been useful*

The attorneys have acted on it.

It

I don't say that it's any better classifi­

cation than there is in the new law, maybe it's not as good»
The- attorneys will follow the new law.
In this cc.se, I Just want to point out one more

thing

nd that is that Respondent is quite disadvantaged In

this case by the .lack of funds, but not anything involved in
the estate, and he received

I received a bill for printing

36
the Appendix of almost «toO’G.» which is about three times what
it cost in Boise, and extensive briefs have been filed In
opposition to Respondent,

We don’t urge that as a matter of

law here, font we do point it cut, and as a matter of law we
do think that the Court should either dismiss this case or
affirm the decision of the Idaho Supreme Court*
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, Stout.

You have two minutes left, Mr* Derr.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENTjv'OFiI'A.LDEN R, DERR, ESQ,,
OH BEHALF 0? THE APPELLANT
IR

uEKRt

Thank you. Your Honor,

Just a few things in response to Mr*- Stout’s
argument♦
Probate Court order that was entered in here and
we find the grounds recited in 2(a) of the jurisdictional
statement, recited only that the statute violated 1531**»
preference statute in support*

No other facts in support of

it *
Another thing that should be pointed out to the
Court, that under Idaho law. each of the parents, in this
case the child died without a will, are entitled to one-half
i

of the estate.
So Sally Reed Is interested hare in the protection
of her own property,whatever that be, too*
Q

Df course, by now, the estate has long since

oey

Ji

been consumed by the cost of litigation, although X suppose
that is irrelevant,
MR; i'ERR:

My client hasn’t seen any, Your Honor,

I think the argument of long acquiescence was
certainly put to bed with Brown, and was more recently pro­
nounced in Brown v, Williams,

I don't think that it has any

merit.
V’e don’t deny that probate is a State matter, but
when portions of it, a law in connection therewith

when it

contravene s the Constitution of the United States it then
becomes a substantial Federal question,

that must be resolved.

The statute in this case is simple.

The actual

•wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very simple, but the
case itself presents a large, and .1 think significant,
problem.
Q

Mr, Derr, 1 seem to remember a case in this

Court involving the constitutions 1 claim of women, young
women, to attend a State Military Academy or take ROTC or
_something.

It rings a faint bell and I can’t find that case

in the brief anywhere,
MR, BEER:

Are you familiar with any such case?

1 am not familiar with the case of the

women wanting to attend Military School, but I am familiar
with the case — the re,cunt case that allowed a State to
maintain one women’s school*

Q

Well, there is the University of Virginia,

I am thinking of an older case in this Court and
I a imply can’t fine! it in the brief or anywhere e3.se»
