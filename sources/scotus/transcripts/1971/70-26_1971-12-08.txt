ORAL ARGUMENT OF COURTNEY WILDER STANTON, ESQ.f
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. STANTONs

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it pleas©

the.-''Courts
This matter is before this Court on an appeal from
the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuits declaring to bs unconstitutional upon its face
a Georgia statute proscribing the unprovoked use to or of
another# and in his presence# of opprobrious words or abusive
language1: tending to a breach of the peace.
Unless the Court has some other direction it would
like to give me, I would like to cover basically what I
consider to be the points drawn in issue by the briefs sub™
mitted by the two sides.
First of all# the question of whether or not this case
is controlled# adversely to our position# by the decision of
this Court in Edwards v. South Carolina.

I would seek

permission from the Court to add one additional citation# what
1 considar to be a controlling State authority on the inter­
pretation of an element of this particular offense# which I
inadvertently omitted from my brief.

4
That case is the decision of Garvin v. fftayor -•*
Q

How do you spell that?

MR. STANTON:

G-a-r-v-i'-n, Your Honor,

“■» which is found at IS Ga, Appeals Reports, at page
636, or in the regional system, in the First Series of South­
eastern Reports, page 84 — excuse me. Volume 84, page 91,
decision from the year 1915,
Q

84 Southeast?

MR, STANTONs First series.
Q

Yes.

91?

MR, STANTON s

Page 91 is where the decision is

covered, Your Honor.
Q

And what's the appellee9s name?

Garvin against

who, Mayor?
MR. STANTON:

Q

Mayor.

M-a-y-e-r?

MR, STANTON:

M-a-y-o-r.

That5s the title of office,

Your Honor.
Q

M-a-y-o-r.

Q

Incidentally, is a decision in your State of

fell© Court of Appeals controlling throughout the State?
MR. STANTONs

It's controlling unless it is reversed

by a decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia, which would be
in conflict with it.

In other words, it would have the sans©

effect on a ferial court as a decision of a court of appeals

s
sitting in that circuit* upon a district within the circuit.
Q

What about a trial court sitting in another

circuit?
MR. STANTONs

Well* our problem is we have only on®

H

Court of Appeals, Your Honor.

It sits in Atlanta, and have

Statewide j urisdiction.
Q

Incidentally* are the facts acknowledged to be

correct as stated in the Georgia Supreme Court opinion?
MR. STANTONs

l*ra not really all that familiar with

the facts in this case.

Because of the facial question that

was presented, we did not go into a great detail on the record
in the caso.

I feel that we can take the issues that were

raised before the Supreme Court of Georgia as being the issues
that were raised before the Supreme Court.

In other words*

these were the enumerations and the questions that were laid
before the State court for determination.
The District Court found* for instance, that there
had not been an exhaustion as to the bulk of the material that
, was encompassed within the application for a writ of habeas
corpus, and refused to consider the bulk of the contentions
that were brought forth by the applicant, the appellee here,
at that point.

It turned it only cm the facial constitutionality

and proceeded from there.
The holding in the case that I've just called the
Court ts attention to

deals with the question of the broadness

6
of the concept of breach of the peace*

Arid I think it5s

very important, because 1 think Georgia, at this point, departs
from its neighboring State of South Carolina to a very
significant extent.
The Court held there that one who commits a breach oi
peace, of the peace, is of course guilty of disorderly conduct?
but than went on to say, but not all disorderly conduct is
necessarily a breach of the peace.
That's where it is merely calculated to disturb or
annoy,
And 1 would submit that this is a pretty sound
analysis, long before we ever got into this ares, of severe
constitutional questions, of what concerns the breaking of the
peace,
Wow, we tend, 1 think, in our decisions to take
disruptions of the peace and actual breaches of the peace and
mix them all together, and of course that is the vie® I find
in many of the ordinances and statutes and common-law offenses
as defined in the State courts, that this Court has had to
deal with,
In Idw&r&s v, South Carolina, we have a case where
the offense was tainted, to my mind, by the circumstances of
the approved, State-approved application.

And the court there

noted the State could not make criminal the peaceful
expression of unpopular views.

7
And that was the writ to which .the breach of peace
definition of the. common law crime, adopted by the Supreme
Court of South Carolina, took the situation.
The court went on to note, and I think rather
significantly, that the record which it looked at in the South
Carolina case was barren of “fighting words”, as that terra is
used.

And South Carolina had extended the concept of breach

of peace to encompass all forms of disorderly conduct,
including conduct which was merely calculated to disturb or
annoy, and therein was the vie© of this particular common-law
offense.
I think we really get into a very similar situation
in Cox and the Terminello ?» Chicago, whore we have an
application my State courts approved, therefore becoming an
authoritative interpretation of the ordinance or statute
involved, which reaches out beyond the idea of breaching the
peace, and goes to the disruption of the peace through
disturbing or annoying antics, conditions or words.
And the court has held that that cannot necessarily
be consistent with the First. Amendment and mad® unlawful.
*

The decision of the court below, in effect, incorpor­
ates on this issue the decision of the District Court, and 1
was really somewhat surprised about this, because the first
portion of the opinion in the Court of Appeals was not even
argued.

The first question was just submitted.

We «pent the

s
entire time arguing this question»

They ruled cn the first issue

on the theory that the Supreme Court of the United States should
have the benefit of the Court of Appeals' determination, and
then, on the one issue that was really controlling in the case,
didn't give ns any real benefit of their determination.

May 1 ask —

MR. STANTON:
Q

Y©s, sir.

«**» looking at the case, it has such an unusual
'

history.

Apparently he got a concurrent sentence

on count

MR. ST&NTOMs
Q

Yes, sir, concurrent with count three.

And count three, is that also under this

statute?
MR. STANTON: That's also under this statute.
Q

And on that — I see, so he's been bailed, he's

still — he got bail on August 11, '69.
would be

And then he still

ME. STANTON: About a month and a half.
Q

— about a month and a half to serve.

So there's

no concurrent sentence problem here, then?
MR. STANTON:

No, sir.

His first two sentences have

Those were the assault and battery sentences.

Service of those was completed before the application for writ
was filed in the District Court.

And it was filed on the basis

‘9

of the final two concurrent sentences, which ware concurrent
one with the other,
Q

Consecutively is what you have her®, though,

MR. STANTONs Well consecutive with the first two.
Q

Well, the appellee's brief says that counts

on©, two and three were to be served consecutively, and count
four was to be served concurrently with count one.
.MR, STANTONs

That would be correct. Count three

would be consecutive to count two.

That is, that's one of

the counts that deals with this particular statute.
Q

He got a year on each, didn't he?

actually — his aggregate was three years?

So that would

He got a year op.

MR. STANTON? Three years.

MR. STANTON ; Three? not one but three *
Q

So that would foe three years, wouldn’t it?

MR. STANTON;
Q

Yes, sir,

And foe started serving on April 15, '68, and was

submitted to bail on August 11, 569, is that right?
MR, STANTON; Good, time took’care of the difference.
Q

Yes, and he would still' have some time to serve,

if he's refused bail?
MR. STANTON;

I think it's about a month and a half

10
I have not computed it out»

Ee has time left on this sentence?

at the time the writ: was granted, he was committed'to bail»
The court below, the District Court, seemed to feel
there was a great deal of confusion in the Georgia cases in
this area, those areas that authoritatively construed the
provision under attack.
I think there was a rather obvious mistake in
relying upon what were really bare-bon© style disposals of
questions ©f procedure and evidentiary sufficiency in certain
cases.

This resulted from the fact that prior to 1902, -when

most of the authority in this case cam© out, we had a one-tier
appellate court system in Georgia.

And of course there was a

tendency to take a decision, decide it on exactly what was
brought before it, and just really enter what was in effect an
order on the case.
Many of the decisions dealt with questions of the
provocation element.

And for some reason or other, there was a

period ©f time when apparently the trial courts were instructing
tiie jury that this was or was not provocation.
Well, of course, provocation is not a. defense under
this offense, or the lack of it? it's an element which tiro State
must prove. And therefore, of course, it was wrong to withdraw
this question from the jury and, in effect, shift the burden
to the defendant of coming in and showing a certain set of
facts was provocation.

11
He had si© sueh burden, any evidence he brought into
that case would simply go against the State's proof of law of
provocation? which is an element it must prove under this
offense.
So I think when we view the offense in that area,
actually view the decision as opposed to the language — don't
get hung up on the language of these order type decisions
— we see that they are quite consistent.

In Fish v,. State, which is one of the cases that they
indicate they feel there is a conflict between the Wilson
decision? some S3 years later, we have the language used in the
charge "you swore to a lie".

And the trial judge instructed

the jury that this was opprobrious words and abusive language,
and the court said? Mo, you can't do that.
the jury as to an element of the offense.

You cannot instruct
Which 1 think seems

pretty obvious, that yon cannot tell the jury that this person
had violated a statute.

Not at least under our Georgia law?

you can't even make, as a trial judge? a comment on the evidence,
much less withdraw, in a criminal case, a portion of the charge
of the offense from the consideration of the jury.
So I think when it's viewed against the backdrop of
what's really involved in the case, the decision is quits clear.
And 1 think that the real difference in the quality
of the language that was used in the Wilson case;-than that which
was used in the Fish case.

12
There are certain words that .quite obviously are
going to be opprobrious or abusive, if used to another person,
as the New Hampshire Supreme Court said, without a smile upon
your face, so to speak, in Chaplinaky.
Q

Well, what’s the essence that is used here, the

epithets or the "I’ll choke you to death**, “if you ever put
your hands on me again, 1*11 cut yon open"?
MR, STANTON?

1 think it’s the use of the abusive

language to the other person.
;

Q

Well, is the epithet standing alone?

Is that a

violation?
MR. STANTONt I think it would be a violation standing
by itself, Your Honor.
Q

Sven if these other words hadn’t been added?

MR. STANTON?

Evan without the other words in there.

Of course, —
Q

And what would be "you son of a gun"?

/

MR. STANTON? This, of course, is a question of common
knowledge and understanding.
under those circumstances?

Now, what is it when it's used
X would

think if wouldn't tend to

a breach of the peace under those circumstances?
Q

That would or would not?

MR, STANTONs

I would think it would not.

X mean,

it's a matter of common knowledge and understanding of a
hypothetical reasonable man — and X always put myself into the

i

13

i

position of being a hypothetical reasonable man; but 1 may not.
be.

But my thought would be. that 5,aon of a gun*1 would not be,

perhaps, words that would tend, under ordinary circumstances,
naturally ~“
Q
it is.

But if yen say “bitch” instead of "gun", then
■

MR. STANTON %
1 think.

It carries a much heavier connotation,

!

A higher degree of opprobrium, one may simply be

offensive or not desirable or something you would rather net
have said to you? the other on®, of course, carries with it a
I
degree of infamy, opprobriousness, or whatever it has.
Q

Well, you might use , a perfectly innocent word

or name that by innuendo would create it.

Suppose you called
I

a man a Benedict Arnold, would you say that would be covered
!

by this statute?
i

Or could be, under some certain circumstances?
:

MR. STANTON s

X would certainly think

that the crime

of treason is an infamous crime, and of course the clearest

j

thing 1 could say if I had to come in and. try tc equate

j

synonyms, and I don't think you can evSr take one word in the
English language and say there's an equal for it.

I mean, if

did, we wouldn't need all the words we have.
But opprobrium probably comes closest to meaning
scurrilous.

It probably comes closest to being infamous.

j
j
I

I

Of course treason is an infamous crime, at least in my Blind it

i

M
is, and 1 think in the comon knowledge and understanding of
people treason would be an infamous crime? so, in effect, what
you're saying to a person, you accuse him of being a Benedict
Arnold, is "you are a traitor".

And if that was used under

such circumstances to a person that the backdrop of the
circumstances were such that under ordinary conditions it would
lead to a breach of the peace, a resentment by physical violence
©f the person to whoa it's directed, then I think it definitely
would be, yes,
Q

At the least it would be, as 1 understand it,

they would have to be in the "fighting words" category? is
that right?
MR. STANTON %

We feel that this statute has always

been applied to ©scactly that kind of language.
Q

"Fighting words"?

MR. STANTONs

The "fighting words" idea.

And if you

view all the decisions, for instance this "you swore to a lief,
well, ©f course, this cam© out of the backdrop of a criminal
or civil procedure, anyway it was a witness to whom this was
directed. This, of course, is charging, at least what was at
that time infamy to perjure one's self, to swear to a lie.
I would think that would b® an opprobrious word.
And 1 think if it were used to a person, under the right
y

circumstances, of course, it would likely invoke the person to
resent by physical violence.

15

Q

Are you suggesting that's the way your Georgia

courts have limited the statutes, to argue it?
MR. STANTON*

Tour Honor*, I think the real case on

this„ of course, is the Georgia Court of Appeals® case in
Elmore* which was in 1951, and is set forth in our brief.
\

This is really one of the few cases that really discusses this

'

thing in th© kind of length and so on an appellate court
discussas it.
Dillardt which the Court rejected before, does, too.
f

I think it’s perfectly applicable.

There are really the only
!

two, what you might call, extensive discussions of the principles

!

in this case.

i

And in Illinois they really emphasised that they

j

termed, and I think what may he a real good terminology for
tills thing, the court talks about, I think ®violent reaction®,

i

but in the case out of California, Cohen v. California, about
words likely to produce a violent reaction.

s
They talk about physical resentment, and 1' think in
the context of this statute that’s probably the best terminology

i
<

yon could use to describe what you5re talking about.

Q

Yes .

MR. STANTON *
a prisoner.

They talk about language addressed to

In other words, here8s a parson In a cell.

Now,

obviously, this person — we’re going back to our reasonable,
ordinary circuiastancas — this person doesn't physically, at
that moment, have the capability to resent.this by physical
violence.
But he is protected from this kind of language,
protected by the veil of this offense frosa being subjected to
abusive and opprobrious language under those circumstances,
and he's not rendered outside the pale of its protection,
simply because at that moment he cannot, as they use the term,
physically resent.
Well, this says two things:

one, it says the

necessity,, you look towards physical resentment, the potential
or likelihood of it, as determining whether or not there's been
a violation of the statute.

Obviously the man could ignore you,

by yelling back at you, if he were in a cell? he could do many
things that -sight be disturbing, but he can't do one thing, and
that's get at yen.
But he's still protected by it.
And they went on to talk about a person on the

1?
opposite bank of an impassable torrent,

They talked about one

who is without power to respond imm-sdiafc® iy to such verbal
inoults by physical retaliation.

And than they likened it,

perhaps dramatically, to a paralytic, who is utterly unable to
break the peace by smy act of physical violence.
Well, this says two thingss

one, that they’re

looking toward the physical violence idea of breach of the
po&aa$ and, secondly, that you're looking toward an ordinary~
circumstances situation, that you don’t take and color the
offense by the nature of the parson against whom this particu­
lar offense is rendered.
.In other words, it’s not a question of a person being
highly susceptible to this, or another parson not being
susceptible, or a parson being physically overpowering and
thus a bully of types? I mean you just don't go on that basis.
Xt's the ordinary circumstances, viewed from the reasonable
man'a hypothesis,

And therefore, a paralytic,who could ndt,

under any circumstances, resent this by physical violence,
is still protected by this particular statuto*
This is not a victimless crime, moral order types
statute? it*s protecting a particular individual.

That is the

parson who's the victim of the offense, to whom this language
is addressed under these circumstances.

MR. STMtTGNt But — and of course that’s incorporated
by statute, whereas, even in a battery situation in Georgia,
the word® can com in for the purpose of, perhaps in a little
different light and connotation, for the purpose of perhaps
being a justification if the other person does resent physical
violence,

that's a rather unusual quirk of Georgia law, but

it’s in there, nevertheless»

Bo you think — now that I’ve interrupted you —

that your —* and your answer to ray brother Brennan’s question —*
that your case is right within the four corners, practically
of

Chaplinsky y. New Hampshire?
MR. STANTONs

Your Honor, I don’t see any way we

could — if we described and made unlawful "fighting words",
somebody would bet up here contending that that was not
aequat®ly defined.
There may be 200 ways you could sit down and describe
"fighting words”.

The Court, I think in one of the last cases,

said that they were personally abusive epitaphs which, when
addressed to the ordinary citiaen or as a matter of common
knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction»
The Georgia Legislature, bad? during the reconstruction

19
— really contemporaneously with the enactment of the Fourteenth
Amendment, by which this particular statute is now tried, —»
defined in terms of abusive language, opprobrious words, and
went on to couple together the elements.

There is no history

that would indicate that this has ever been applied .to anything
except what would appear, from common knowledge and under­
standing, to be "fighting words” within Chap1inskyQ

Well, then, your answer to my question is yes?

MR, STANTON:
Q

Yes, sir.

Well, that Isn't what the District Court

thought, and this is a District Court sitting in.the State*
Judge Smith didn't construe the State statute to be limited to

He construed it precisely the reverse.

MR* STANTON:
went about it, though.

Look at the way in which Judge Smith
He took the synonyms that were cut

of the dictionary, and he took "disgraceful, abusive, .insulting,
.offensive h.
Q

Well-, who would know more about, what the

Georgia law means. Judge Smith or this Court?
ME, STANTONs

Well, I would suggest very strongly that

Judge Smith was not on target in construing til©. Georgia law
in this particular case.

For instance, he got off on the

Wish case, and then we brought in the Dillard matter, but ha

22

saidf Ohe no, that deals with another section.
Yet the two sections are United by the terminology»
“and whosoever in like manner £% meaning certain operable
elements discussed in. Dillard, but obviously bear upon this
particular decision.

And Dillard» of coarse, was the very

first decision to indicate that this was confined not to
/

areas that annoyed and not to areas that were.disturbing, but
to actual words that were likely to invoke a breach of the

peace.
New f just to show the way in which the District Court
went off» it said, for instance, it could see no reason,
constitutionally, for protecting the kind of conduct that was
engaged in.

But if went on to say3

as construed by the

Georgia courts, especially in the instant case, the Georgia
provision as to breach of the peace is even broader than
the Louisiana statute.
But the Louisiana statute was so construed that if
' *>
C
applied to conduct on the application itself that ought to be
protected.
Now, he cannot cite an instance in which this has
4

been applied to conduct that ought to be protested, but he
follows this circular pattern of reasoning down to conclude
that this case is broader than Cox.v» Louisiana, which I simply
cannot follow the reasoning on.
In other words, he says the conduct isn’t protected,

23
ought not to be protected,, can be made unlawful in contrary
situations where there's a certain protected type conduct
involved.

And the statute was construed to cover it.
i

And 1 certainly can't sea how this statute, as
construed, could even reach the conduct involved in Cox v.
Louisiana» where th© whole pattern of application, we8vs had
the same civil disobedience situations in Georgia that occurred
in Louisiana, and, to my knowledge, this is the only time that
a statute has ever been involved in a case that arose in issue
out of civil disobedience.
This was, as I understand the facts, was a demonstra­
tion addressed to &n induction canter of the United States
Army.

There were a number of demonstrators, and of all the

demonstrator© it was only Wilson who fell afoul of this
particular statute.

Surely, the demonstration annoyed the Army.

Certainly it was of some disruption, I'm sure.

It was certainly

sufficient to bring the police department out to see what was
occurring in the area.

w fighting words53.
MR, STANTONs Well, he of course took that view.
But there's not a basis in any of the decisions to support Ms
view»
In other words, there's no authority in Georgia that
would apply this to anything other than this particular thing
that I would call, as a matter of common knowledge, "fighting
words K.
If you note that in the Chaplinsky statute, you have
this question raised, and they said they have supplied
judicially to their statute one of the very same things that
is in this statute, that was written into it, that's the idea
of tending toward the breach of the peace.
We said that, Sure, you couldn't come out and say

Q

Yes.

MR. STANTON; And decide upon them,
Smith made a gross error.

X' think Judge

We wouldn’t have this case up here.

1 think h® made a severe mistake on Georgia law,

I don't think

he adequately interpreted it.
Hers again, obviously there's a conflict in this
particular situation, but there just isn’t the basis
Q

Who was on the panel in the Court of Appeals?

MR. STANTON; We had Judges Simpson, Morgan, and

And who was from Georgia?

MR. STANTON;

Judge Lewis Morgan.

Morgan.

Oh, it's Morgan that's from Georgia.

MR, STANTONs And we had one judge, and I believe he's
from Texas, Judge Ingraham? but I'm not sure.
Q

Now, he's not — h@ specifically agreed with

Judge Smith.
MR,, STANTONs

During the argument we submitted to

the court, there wasn't any real consensus among the judges.
«

There wasn't anything that would reflect that the opinion would
be as right down the line with what Judge Smith wrote that —
Q

No, but did you submit to the Court of Appeals

that Judge Smith's understanding of Georgia law was in error?
MR, STANTON is

We submitted it on the same basis ,

practically the same brief was presented.
Q

And they specifically rejected you?

MR. STANTONs And they rejected us, yes.
Q

Another Georgia judge?

Q

And there's not a Georgia judge sitting here.'

MRa STANTONi

That's unfortunate, Your Honor, we

were not consulted on that matter, at all.
(Laughter»}
1 just feel that of course the Court is going to have
to take the authoritative determinations made by the Georgia
court and not read into them the issues .that ar ; ■

by misinterpreting what the

I don't knew how you can wipe out the Elmore case on

physical resentment* And if you cannot —~ if you cannot -*
constitutionally prohibit this kind of conduct, 1 think perhaps
Judge Smith's real view was that wa ware prohibiting conduct
that had fallen — n$& so such that he was misunderstanding th
Georgia law, but that he was misunderstanding the «fxoct which
this decision would have on the other decisions on this Court*
For instance, I don't believe this statute could over
reach th© Cantwell conduct*

1 doubt vary seriously it could

ever reach Foiner * s conduct .in Peiner^v*__Mew York *
It might very well have reached the conduct of the
man mentioned in Mr, Justice Douglas's concurring opinion, who
was calling out epitaphs to Feiner while he was speaking*
might, under the circumstances.

Xt

That would be a question we’d

have to look at.
This is obviously intentional conduct.
directed conduct*

It directs to a specific victim.

l’t's
It’s

Intended to take effect upon that victim. And it is intended,
or likely to produce physical resentment from him.

But this

is in “fighting words" that I don't believe any Legislature
in th© country can define "fighting words” other than as
”fighting words".
And there again w© have th© problem of what is the
standard.
The final point I would make, Your Honors, I feel that
the decisions of this Court approve exactly what th© Georgia

28
court has done towards the decisions I've construed in this

case.
1 can only submit it to you on the view that the
decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. ELIZABETH R. RINRSKQPF,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MRS. RINDSKOPFs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
I'd like to open my remarks by adding a footnote as
to the posture of this case.

We've already discussed the

fact that the appellee hare has approximately two months left
to serve in this sentence.
In addition to that fact, there is a three-judge
court which has passed on the appropriateness of this statute
as well, this would bear on. the point we were just discussing
as to how many Georgia judges have ruled on the constitutionality
of the statute*

In fact, Judge Morgan sat along with Circuit

Judge Griffin Bell, and District Judge Alexander Lawrence.
When the statute was again attacked in a separate
action, they accepted the opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court
of Appeals? agreed with it? and again held
Q

—

They sat as a District Judge with the District

2fv

Court?

MRS * RXNDSKOPF;
Q

Pidn51 they have'to?

MRS* RXNDSF.OPF:
q

Yes *

X beg pardon?

Would they not be bound by the Court of Appeals

decision, sitting as the District Court?

Did they have any

choice but to follow?
MRS * RXHDSKO?Ps

That8s a very good point.

They would,
Q

They’d have to follow it?

MRS. RXNDSKOPFi
Q

Yes, yes, they would.

Mrs, Rindekopf, why did the appellant wait for

almost a year to bring his habeas application, do you know?
MRS. RXHDSKOPFj

X did not handle this below.

I

believe the reason is because ha was going through the Georgia
courts.

The record reflects that he appealed it through the

Court of Appeal© a&cbalso applied for certiorari in this Court,
and I escpect that would probably have taken him about a year's
time.

X believe he did promptly file his habeas in federal

court*
To return to my opening point, the point-I’d like to
make is that not only do we have a three*»judge court ruling,
we have a Fifth Circuit ruling, we also have a new statute in
this area, Georgia Code Annotated 26~2610*

The nsw statute

ie, really, for all intents and purposes, the same on© that

30
we * re considering here, yet it continues to be applied.
Now, X think that may go to the question of what
happens if this Court should overrule the Fifth Circuit Court
of appeals?

What effect will that decision have?

and it

would appear that the Georgia courts seem to feel that the
new statute is something differentr and that a separate ruling
is going to be required on that statute.
Naturally, we're arguing that this Court should affirm
the Fifth Circuit decision, and X think this may support our
argument, simply by the point that any decision that we get
on this particular case is probably going to have little
effect, both to our appellee and to others in like situations,
There will be no others in like situations.
0

I'm having a little difficulty hearing you.

MRS. RXNDSKOPFs

X'm sorry.

I have this problem,

My remarks, X think, can be brief,

X think the

discussion that's already gone heretofore indicates the signal
fact here, and that's that no one knows what an opprobrious
word is,

The Georgia Supreme Court said that the words used

by our appellee here were, per se, opprobrious? whatever that
my or may not mean.
I think this is what caused Judge Smith to overrule
the statute.

He felt that if individual words can be stricken

by a statutef that by that act, the First Amendment has been
infringed upon•

31
Q

Well, do ycu think anybody knows any bat-tor

what "fighting wordsB are?
MRS, RINDSKOPFs

I'm not certain, and I5n glad I don't

Well, what are you going to do — what do you do

about question in —
MKS, RXND3KOPFs Well, X simply say that in this
situation we have a statute that goes much, much more broadly
than simply "fighting words"*

The question as to whether the

words uttered in this situation are "fighting” is another
question,
I'd like to stress the fact that \m do have here an
assault and battery committed.

Mow, our .appellee has already

served time for that assault and battery,

what we're left with

is pure speech that ~~
Q

Well,' not very "pure" under the circumstances.

MRS. RXHDSKOPFs

conduct.

Weir© really talking —

-- 1 have the same question in my mind that Mr,

Justice Stewart was just- pressings

Why isn’t this a Chapllnsky

case?
MRS. RXNDSKOFF:

Simply because X believe the statute,

as drawn, does not make clear that it is *• fighting words" that
are proscribed,
Q

In other words, what you’re saying, X gather,

is that even if, as to these very words, they fall within
Chaplinaky, the overbreadth of the statuta gives him standing
with active

that even though as applied to

him it might not be constitutional?
MRS. RXNDSKOPFs Well, X don’t agree that as applied
to him it is constitutional,

Q

In the light of Chap1insky?

MRS» RXHDSROPFs

Simply because I think, as interpreted

by the Georgia Supreme Court, what they are saying is that, these
particular words fall within the statute. They are, per as,
a violation of the statute.

And t don't believe that a statute

can say that.
And that’s, in effect, the reading we have on this
statute.

Well, per $a, opprobrious words.in any State in

MRS, R2KDSK0PFs

X think the answer to that question,

and I would say, to begin with, that X don’t believe 1 am
competent to make an answer? X think it depends on who says
them.

The®© are words that have bean quite controversial.

And

X think, particularly in interracial contacts, the meaning may
be different than what ordinarily we would assume the words to

May X go back to the question I asked your

Neither federal opinion here gives us. any facts,

Are the facts as stated in the Georgia Supreme Court opinion
acceptable to both sides here?
MRS, RINDSKOPF;

1

As being a correct statement,

believe they are correct.

Now, once again, X have to ask your indulgence, I
did not handle this at the trial court level.

So I'm not

certain of that, but X believe the facts as stated are correct.
I have a few very brief things to point out about
the statute as wall.
One in that the statute would appear to have no
intent or wilfulness requirement.

It's simply an opprobrious

word which tends to breach the peace,

Gar position would be

that without any kina of wilfulness and with the only standard
that of one tends to cause a breach of the peace, it5si an
unaecertainabl© standard, and one which a parson Cannot be

36
expected to understand or comprehend, in order to gauge 'hie
action accordingly.
1 think it5a also worthy of note, the Court has heard
a number of arguments today about victimless crimes.
we have such a situation here.

X think

The appellee has already b©en

punished for hi a assault. What's left arc a few profanities
that he uttered in anger f and I wonder that © statute can, in
this day and age, b© held by the highest court in the State to,
per s®, outlaw words that he uttered in such a situation,,
We would feel, in conclusion,, that this Court's
opinion in Cohen v. California bears very heavily on the
situation presented her©.

My reading of that opinion would

he that it's improper for a State Court to outlaw individual
words,

And that's precisely what —Q

Well, have you read page 20 of the opinion?

MRS, RINDSKOPF:
q

I beg your pardon?

I hop© I have.

Which seems — I have it right in front of me —

explicitly to reaffirm Chaplinaky v. .Hew Hampehlre* as
distinguished from —MRS. RINDSKOPFs
good law.

I'm assuming that Chaplinsky is

I have not assumed that that has been overruled.

Q

It points out that in Cohen the words were not

addressed to anybody ? no showing that anyone who saw Cohen
was in fact violently aroused or that appellant intended such
a result

MRS* EINDSKQPF: Wall, but what the Supreme Court of
Georgia said was- that by the utterance of these words, he
offended the statute*
Q

Well? in the circumstances that were present®

I mean, they certainly —

MRS. RlHDSKOPFi But that'8 not what the court said®
Q

1 know, but they spoke in the context of the

facts that they gave.

You can’t say that the Georgia court

meant that any time you say these words in your basement,
that you’ve violated the statute.

MRS* SIMDSKOPFj

No.

But as I read that opinion,

it refers to “at any time these words are said within the
hearing of others® that is, per so, a violation of the statute»
The words used by the court were, in and of themselves,
"ar© opprobrious“.

Q

Well, that may be, but that isn’t — we have the

— we know the facts in which, the circumstances under which
these words were spoken.

MRS» RXNDSKOPPs
•

Don’t we?
Yes, we do,

i

In conclusion, 2 would simply stress tha fact that
to rovers® the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision is,
in all probability, going to affect no oh*.

We feel that the

statute as presently drawn is overbroad, that it presents a
standard that our appellee could not have hoped to have under­
stood or to have foreseen, at the time ha began his picketing

38
in tills situation, and that consequently the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals opinion should be upheld in this instance«

MRS. RXKDSKOPFs

What I'm saying, Mr. Justice

Marshall, is that if he knew of the statute he certainly could
not know what would be offensive to it, because of the
interpretations of the Georgia Supreme Court.
Q

Well, what respect did he give the statute

Hs didn't know about that one, either?
MRS. RIHDSKGPFs

It seams to me that what they’re saying is that the
fact of his utterance of these words, by that fact, then also
rendered him subject to the statute that we attack here, the

Mrs. Rindskopf, did you eay earlier in your

MRS. RXNDSKOPFs There is a new statute, and the cite
to that, is 2© -■» Georgia Code Annotated 2610.
Slow, tiie point X make is that that statute roads
almost identically to the one that we consider here.

I thxnk

what's relevant about the presence of that new statute is that
the Georgia courts have continued to apply the new statute.

minute left, if you wish to use it,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF COURTNEY WILDER STANTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
•t

MR. STANTON;

,•

Well, just to clarify one thing.

The reason why they're continuing to utilise sections
under the statute is because, in light of the nature of this
case anet the way in which it casta to this Court, we do not feel
the decision of the Fifth Circuit precludes prosecutions under
the statute, until this Court has spoken, one way or the other.
I may be wrong, but people have called me and asked
me that, and I’ve given them my opinion to that effect.

This

was not an injunctive type of procedure? it was directed only
to this particular habeas corpus applicant.

And it only

involves that case, until we have a broader overview.
The new statute you will find in the white pamphlet.
This is a result of a recodification of the Georgia law, and
it bears the same numbers as the old area, but the new 26.2610,
which Mrs. Rindskopf referred to, will fee found in the white
pamphlet.
Q

What white pamphlet?

MR. STANTONt

It’s the on® that accompanies the

Georgia Code, Annotated Supplement.

42
Q

Right,

Nothing that has been filed in this

case here, though?
MR, STANTON8 No, sir; it would b© in your library in

If you go pull the green one down, you are

going to fine! an old 2610; that has nothing at all to do with
this.

And 6303 was simply moved to that area.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Thank you, Hr. Stanton.
Thanh you, Mrs. Rindskopf.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2s56 p.ra., the case was submitted.)
