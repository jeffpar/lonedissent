the Courtt
This cis here on writ of certiorari to the Court

of Criminal E.ppeaio to review a death-penalty rape conviction
in ti,i- Wilbarger County District Court in the State of Texas.
The evidence adduced by the State t which was uncon~
tra'vcicfc&E by any evidence put on by the defendant, petitioner
:.n this case, indicated that in the early morning hours a young

The

Conversation ensued thereafter for some

He then left, and was arrested, convicted, and given

the death penalty.
There was absolutely no medical testimony showing any
typo of injury, of any sort, to the complainant in this case.
via feel that capital punishment in this case is
■..1, • •;or the Eighth .amendment, for two basic reasons:
First of all, the standards by which we suggest this

in any case indicate that it is unusual in terms of frequency

the fact that it is used on identifiable minorities?

he respectfully- submit that the standards which are
appropriate for this Court ’ n use are those laid out in Baker vs,
Carr. Brevn vs„ _ Board of Education, and Jacobellis vs. Ohio,
That is to say,, national standards, must be employed to determine
whether or net the use of any punishment in any one case, in
any county or State, is unusual or is not unusual.
applying these national standards, we • see that therv;
are a vary limited number of States that use capital punishment
as punishment for the offense of rape.
In going to Texas, we have some statistics in an
article by Koeninger, which I've cited in the brief.

I think

th-ksse statistics go further than most statistics that have
bean presented to the Court.
The Koeningsr studies go not only to the number of
blanks who have received the death penalty for rape, but they
c-.loo cover fcb.D frequency with which any defendant accused of

It appears in the brief at pages 19 ana

Q

Thank you.

MR. BRUDER; The amazing thing that I found in the
Teen.Lager studies is there have been some instances in Texas
of -joint trials, a Negro and a whits defendant accused of
raping the 3-ama person at the same time.

studies indicate that in these

And Kceninger*s

type of cases the Negro

Invariably will c f the death penalty, whereas the white or

$*&tin~Amerlean will be spared that fate.
Sow, thru State has attempted to refute some of these
by •saying that Negroes commit more rapes. They
cite sane Philadelphia indemnity statistics.

X don't think

ifcuse '.r-. replicable in view of Kceninger*s thoroughness,
. . ik.-\:h«ger uses pure statistics s
fhr expectancy of the death penalty on a racial basis,
or?

do not get death.

6

bow, .inwthni: interesting point that concerns this
cato only*

In Texes the Legislature has seen fit to create a

number of offenses, all of which, conceivably, could be charged
:..n

>1

rape situation»

flere is the offense of aggravated

assault, mcls or finaletha offense of murder or assault to
murder, with or without malice.
The only
Q

This point of discrimination, was that raised at

the trial or on the appeal in this case?
MR, BRUDER:

Your Honor, I believe it was brief eel

very generally in the brief.

I did not participate until after

tha conviction was affirmed.

As I recall, there were no

statistics or no proof introduced at the trial level or on any
hearing for motion for .new trial.

If was, I believe, mentioned

in the brief filed by the petitioner’s court-appointed attorney
in the Court of Criminal Appeals,
The only difference between an assault to rape or an
assault to murder or aggravated assault and rape is the act of
intercourse.

The punishment for any man who assaults any woman

in the Strife of Terei cannot exceed 2S years, unless he
accomplishes the act. of rape, in which case the punishment goes
from 25 years to death.
.a feel that this is certainly an inconsistency within
the legislative penological system in Texas, which ought to be
considered in determining whether or not. the use or the death

?
penalty for rape, coupled, with the, what I consider to be,
light punishment :u.

assault cases of similar nature, is unusual

because of this distinction,
Xn the State

>f Texas there is another consideration

that sheds light, and at this point 1 might say that it perhaps
W£r, improperly briefed as my fifth point,.

I think that the

mention of the facts under that fifth point have bearing as an
issue to be decided here, not whether or not Article 1.14,
authorising the prosecutor to seek or waive the death penalty,
is unconstitutiona]

r* 1 early
a
that was not raised below,

However, the grant of legislative authority to all
prosecutors in Texas, which enables them to select who will be
candidates for the death penalty and who will not be candidates,
obtains as a forceful argument in this case in support of this
petitioner5 s point,
1

think the argument made by the District Attorney

in this case points out this? he told the gentlemen of the jury,
las saids

"The responsibility lies with me and solely with ra©
for you being qualified on the death penalty.

The State allows

me, the law allows me, as State’s Attorney, to waive the death
penalty, but it also directs me in a case I am going to insist,
on the death penalty, that 2 give written notice to the
farsnciant.

V-

fv:.'3 .1;

your District Attorney, but 2*m telling you

nr at

it

l don't

know how much confidence you folks

gentlemen that had Z not thought that this cas ; justified the
supreme penalty, ~ vgul; have waived the death penalty.”
Q

Mr, •/rudor, isn’t that a provision that is common

tc a number of other States besides Texas?
MR, BKUDFRs Frankly, ¥our Honor; I don’t know.

I’ve

seen some statutes which do not have it, and I have not
investigated all of the statutes; because a lot of them, of
course, were not tied in to rape statutes, and I was just unable
to get all of them.
If it

X would say that if it is common to all the

other States, then it would have to suffer the same defect in
other States as it: dees in Texas, that the grant of this author­
ity to the District Attorney to, in effect, change the range of
punivissent * depending upon any number of factors which he alone
controlled, such as the race of the defendant, the facts of
the case.
Q

How would you distinguish that its the situation

where the prosecutor decides to prosecute for a lesser rather
than a, greater offense?
Ml. BRUD'SR:
?:!.u .

Because in a -- when the prosecutor

& decision, he could make a decision based on facts that

ato available to aim, whether or not ha thinks he can prove
up ais

whether or not he thinks he can get a conviction

: burglary' as opposed to breaking and entering private
preparty, or something like this.

Tv a uifvv-vvv the main difference is that the
: ,

-i;: a :. a range of punishment to this crime,

has

that that range of pvdmvaenf is really very nebulous until the
defendant knows with certainty whether or not the prosecutor
is going to seek the death penalty,
ft- prosecutor, instead of choosing the offense based
on the law and based on the facts of the case, is changing the
range of punishment.
Q

Under the laws of Tessas, how binding is that

decision of the prosecutor on either the judge or the jury?
MR. BRUDEE:

Once the judge

well, once the State

has decided not tc reek the death penalty, the death penalty
cannot be given.
Q

Once he decides to go for the death penalty,

hew binding is that?
MR. BRUDERs Well, he certainly can waive his right to
> for it by asking for something less, or by withdrawing his
notice p:: ior to trial.

But the point, is that unless he asks

fcr the der-th penalty, as prescribed by statute, if cannot be
given by the jury.
Q

And that hurts the defendant?

I-R, BRUDERs

I think it does, Your Honor, because

perhaps if he does».*t have this authority, a jury is not going
to be told what this prosecutor told this jury.
itr•. Renfro is an elected public official, and he*s

10
elects-,':- by the;-:-

ic- "v, the jury»

He's telling them that,,

"It's say dcse:',.r:.-;n„ the legislature has given this decision to
■•ae, arid I Iiavlec. tied, to the exclusion of all the other cases,
this is the one that 1 want you to" —
Q

Well, asruree that he was wrong in saying it.

How doss that reach the issue in this case?
MR. BRUDBR:

I don't think we can assume *— if we

assume he was wrong in saying it, we would have a jury that
didn't believe him. and va wouldn't have a death-penalty case.
1 moan, he is right in saying that the Legislature
does give hit-; the authority»

Because the District Attorneys

in. Texas have the absolute authority to seek a waiver against
the —

Q

Well, X guess you would say that some jurors

may say, "If the prosecutor prosecutes the case, the man's
guilty”but that's not what we've got, this is not the issue
va've got before us.

Their faith in the prosecuting attorney,

'i don't sea what's so great about it.
MR. BRUDERs

'i don't think it's a question of their

faith, it5£.- a question of whether or not the prosecutor ought
a© .'.•.avo tfc*. right, to change the range of punishment for any
reason that he desires.
C:

Well, I don't — do you know of any State that

prohibits the prosecutor from either

from making — the

■arose outer from making the charge of whether to go for the

11
death penalty or not?
Do yon know of any State?
MR* BRUDlfU Well, Your Honor, the State of Texas, if
■ms. is cb.a?:go-l with burning of the' State Capitol, there is a
mandatory death penalty»
o

So —

Well, do you know of any State in which there

is not a mandatory death penalty, which doesn't give the
prosecutor the right to either go for the death penalty or not?

MR* BRUDSkt

If I understand the question correctly,

ay answer would b® that I don't know of any State that does not
give the prosecutor the choice*
Q

So any prosecutor in the country can make this

same statement?

And, if so, what * s so different about Texas?

MP. BRUDERi Because in

some other State, where the

prosecutor does not have a requirement imposed to file the
notice, the jury, ecu Id override the prosecutor ”s will and still
assess the death penalty.

Q

They couldn't do that in Texas?

MR. BRUDERs

In Texas, the jury cannot; once the

prosecutor has gives- notice not to seek the death penalty, the
jury may not assess the death penalty.

If they do it is a void

judgment.
Q

It's what?

MR. BROSv'iP.s

It5 a a void judgment.

And the Court of

Criminal Appeals would either remand it or reverse it.
Siv'; it *■..% prosecutor seeks the death penalty»
the jury is perfectly free not to return a death penalty, isn’t
it?
$R. BP.USERs That’s correct.

That's correct.

The

full range of punishment then applies.
We have briefed . in the brief the point that this
can be used against identifiable racial minorities by the
prosecutor» and 1 think it is a valid consideration in support
of the fact that identifiable racial minorities in Texas do
receive the death penalty.
Tho fact that perhaps whites and Chicanes do not get
the death penalty as frequently as blacks is due, in large

;
s

part»• to tlu: fact that the prosecutor simply doesn't ask fojf it.
•Even, waives it» thinking that ha can't get it or just not
wanting to get it for any number of good reasons.
■' don’t think that the issue of capital punishment
in a rape case such as this need hang on all the arguments made
for abolition of capital punishment in any case.

I think the

opinion in Ralph v. Warden clearly points out that the
infrequency of its use. the infrequency of its availability
across this nation, indicates that it is net a fit punishment;
1 think ti
cf th:

1 the arguments which would be urged in support

. protection argument or due process argument would

■if'•'.it it. a.n nrguraant tc show that it was unusual.

13
h&

fa;: a« the question of whether or not unusual

should be defined by new or old standards, I would cite the
Court to the caeo* sir* Justice White8 s dissent in Waesis, which
the third objective of unusual, definition of unusual that he
laid down was?

Operations, the unusual prohibition operates

to ru&train any lawmaking power from endowing the judiciary
with the right to exert an illegal discretion 'as to the kind
and extent of punishment to be inflicted*
Novo, that has to be measured in contemporary terms
by ccnteaiporary standards, not by standards of two centuries
ago*

Otherwise the word "unusual" has no meaning because it

is fixed by what occurred back in the 1700‘s»
If you pleaser 1 would like to reserve the remainder

of my argument for rebuttal.
MI?* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

Very well.

Mr* Wright„
ORAL AFfiOMBbT OF CHARLES MAN WRIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR* WRIGHTs

br* Chief Justice, and may it please

fcha Court:
I will endeavor not to repeat arguments that have
box-, presented in the three cases that have preceded, and limit
i.r/se-lf to those points shat haven * t been raised and I, perhaps,
may be helpful to the Court*
s':;: , airalya Is of the case begins with the question

14
Lt.-i Chief ccstirv put to Mr, Amsterdam in the argument of the

Forman ease, and to which I say with respect X do not think
there was a complete answer.
T'm.Chief Justice pointed out that many of the

jurisdictions that Mr. Amsterdam and those associated with him
. • oj-ru'd ©s abolitionist jurisdictions have in fact not abolished
capital punishment entirely.

They have preserved that

■rtremfc penalty for somewhat unusual cases;

the murder of a

policeman or a correctionman or official, or a murder committed
by a person already serving a life sentence, or, in English and
Canadian versions we find dockyard arson, or piracy with
violence,
It seems to raa that this is extremely important.
Because if one accepts that there is any case,, any crime for
which death is an appropriate punishment, then I think most
of the force of the argument Professor Amsterdam has made
vanishes.

If we ware to 'say, for example, as Congress said'

only seven years aero, that the assassination of a President is

a crime so heinous that only the death penalty is meat for it.
Then I cannot see how it can be argued that the penalty

unconstitutional merely because it is a penalty that may not
be inflicted in a great many cases, because it is somewhat
ra re, as has been suggested to us today.
c would find it very difficult fee understand how this
• y.

a., •: constitutional matter t could draw these kinds of

15
thadings

ii dxstincuioait that England and Canada and New York

and some other jurisdictions have done.

I do not see how you

could write an opinion and say, We are persuaded that capital
punishment 1' in general cruel and unusual, but this does not
disable the legislature from taking care of Presidential
assassins or bombers of 747*s or other very unusual people of
that kind.
It seems to me that the Constitution; necessarily
paints with a much broader brush than a legislature can do, and
■the Court has to respect these broad differentiations.
But if then we can say that the Presidential
assassin constitutionally can he executed, it seems to me that
we have established that death is, in itself, not inherently
cruel»
Now, there's much more than that in my reading of the*
lirgbth &s&qtidraent.

The analysis that I've suggested in the

brief is that the Eighth amendment bars those things that are
inherently cruel and perhaps also those things that are
cruelly excessive.,

And I think of course one — there would

still foe ample room to say that the death penalty for some
particular crime may be cruelly excessive, even though we have
held it is not inherently cruel, and said there are some things
to which you can apply it.

Q

Ceuldn * t that argument be directed in the ether

direction.- Mr. Wright, ao well?

Here we nave' generalised

statutes, in this case involving rape.

You say it*s been

established, and that’s the statute that's before us in this
particular case.
MR. WRIGHT:
Q

Correct,

We don’t have a statute before us involving the

penalty that Congress may have imposed for assassination of a
President of the United States.

And it might be that the death

sentence for a highly particularised crime such as that might
be constitutional, but that this legislation now before us
might not be? wouldn't they?
MR. WRIGHT i

I would submit, in response to that,

Justice Stewart, that perhaps such a position can be made, such
an argument can be presented? but that at least is not the
argument that I have understood the petitioners in this case
to be making.
Mr, Amsterdam, in the two murder cases, says that a
death is unconstitutional for any civilian peacetime crime?
and cf course a more limited, specialised view was taken of
raps, to which I will come in a moment, by Mr, Greenberg and
Mr. Bruder.

Now, 2 cannot, myself, see the constitutional

argument that would say that murderers generally cannot-be

U

that the death sentence, per se, is not a violation of the
Eighth Amends'ent, it dotsn’fc follow that the death sentence

ME. WRIGHT* That 1 think is very clear, yes, sir.
But that if wa have established that -the death
penalty sometimes is constitutional, it is still open to my
friends to challenge any particular application of it to a
class of crime, by daylag that you cannot do.

I am willing to

,iv Keens with all the problems it presents as introducing
a principle of proportionality, and like 1 would say, if it’s
petty laresncy it would shock the conscience of the community

There; was some scholarly thought

that the A-voaican draftsmen didn’t understand what the English

meant by the®.
T.te cone trot that the Eighth Amendment seems to mfe'tc

express s at the Chief Justice said in his plurality opinion in
?£egt is that we ar-.rn’t going to allow inhuman treatment.

And

I would say that the kinds of things we won’t allow are those

that the common conscience of America rejects.
Ay own guess is that, even if the Eighth Amendment
had never been adopted,, that this Court would not uphold a
acate?; c-s tint a man be boiled in oil.

I think that under the

dtic process clause it would be impossible to say that that’s

taking his life away without due process of law. And X think
that, just, as due process has always been a very difficult
concept to interpret# so cruel and unusual is going to he.
It is not easy for nine of you sitting on that side

of the b&vich to decide what it is that the common conscience
of America regards as meat, and what it regards as ‘improper.
1 clo not think that this is # as my brother Amsterdam

suggesta, to say that this is a subjective determination. It
would be subjective if the Justices were free to says

I think

death or any other penalty is bad# therefore, it is unconstitu~
tional.

19
ycorself to <. ■: -rh': .in, as best you can, what it is that the
ccet’oien-

;ho wioie jro.vntry permits rather than relying

on your own individual judgment.
1 think that if you do ask what I visualise is the
proper question, that the answer has to be that whatever the
future may hold, that capital punishment today is tolerated,
accepted by the conscience of America•

This is shown not only

by the statutes on the books, by the votes of jurors, by votes
in .referendums, by polls, by the very fact that we have so much
dels ate about it.

With all the fervor that th© crusade has been

waged with to abolish capital punishment, there have still been
those who insist, "no, at this time in society we need this,
we think it's a superior deterrent»“
Thoughv we recognize we can't prove, that statistically,
think that it dess provide & sense of expressing the
community's moral outrage, that it helps make a more peaceful
••society than if the community has to take the law in its own
hands.
It is-difficult for me to understand, but merely
because we do not execute a great many people every week, that
this in some way shows that .America has now rejected capital
punishment.

I would think that it would be cause for rejoicing

that we’ve become increasingly selective about imposing the
ultimate and most savers ; ' penalty.
Mr. Wright, what if it were shown that only one

20
in a hundred rap 1st» were put to death out of a hundred cases,
approximately

presenting approximately the same facts? weald

that make; any di fference in your argument?
MR, WIGHTs

Xt would not trouble me* Justice White,

under the cruel and unusual clause f it would trouble me
immensely under the duo process clause.
Q

Well, —

MR, WRIGHTi

It seems to me it's McGautha all over

again.
fi

2 know, but you say we should rejoice that we’ve

become increasingly selective.

In my example there wouldn’t

be any selectivity there, there would just, be you might
arguably say the State is executing only enough people to «take
the death penalty a credible threat.
But you say that wouldn’t present any question for
you under the cruel and unusual clause?
MR. WRIGHT:

No, sir; not under cruel and unusual.

It would under due process, it would under equal protection.
It could seers to me arbitrary if 100 similarly circumstanced
defendants are convictad, 99 of them go to prison and then one
is selected by law for process under the death penalty and is
executed.
C>

Other than you ■— your argument on this phase

of i' would foe, the/;;., that no matter how rare the imposition
is;

flat the cruel and unusual punishment provision is not

21
impaxcated?
VR, :JRIGH’?Unless? it came to the point that you

pvt hypothetically, that we con .id satisfy oursoives that the
people simply would not tolerate imposition of the punishment
aore widely, that they would be, as my friends "argue, revolted

murderers

—~ oh that, put it aside for the moment.

MR. WRIGHT:

In the first placa, I cannot use th©

figures for the last ten years.

It seems to me there have been

too many intervening events that make those figures unreliable.
X ray you would have to go back to a year such as 1962 or
earlier in order to have the figures that are at all meaningful.

23
Wellt let’s assume the figures from ?S2 on were

Q
v-alii?

v/.i&l.

would v.: sv al'.-nrt those?
•1. WRIGF.M

And were acceptable.

i’hey would show increasingly infrequent

use of capital punishment.

Whether they would show, as Professo;

Amsterdam argues, that we use it that infrequently because
people world he revolted if we used it more frequently, I cannot
say.

It seems to me that that aspect of his argument is
/

as sertion.
C-

Don’t we have to say, or not?

Is our only way of avoiding answering that, question
to say the figures are invalid?
MR. WRIGHT:

Mo.

It seems to me, as several of my

associates have suggested, that the burden is on those who are
challenging the constitutionality of State legislation to

establish that it violates the

Constitution.

They need to

demonstrate that the common conscience won’t accept this.
Q

Well, they tender the figures for the years

since ’62, and say that imposition of the death sentence is so
rare that the community is revolted by itr and it must be
considered to have rejected it.
MR, WRIGHT:
Q

Mow, let5s assume the figures are valid, that we

can rely on them.

What would you say to that?

MR, WRIGHT:

Mfclish thi

Yes, that’s what they say.

Well, I still don’t sea how the figures

-.d part.

They don’t establish what the cause

24
is, Justice whi
Q

So, you

X gather, then, that rarity then just

isn't enough to invoke the Eighth amendment.
MR. WRIGHTs

Rarity is, as rvs suggested, is, I

think, one element of the Eighth amendment problem, but it is
not the only element.

We need more, we need to know more than

we do know.
Q

But that’s just another way of saying, on your

part, isn't it, that the term "unusual” in the Eighth
Amendment does not ms an, or at least is not fully synonymous
with "infrequent"?
MR. WRIGHTs That is precisely my submission, Mr.
Chief Justice,
Q

There are other elements, the quality of the

punishment a;;, well as the frequency, that go into it,
.MR. WRIGHT!

My guess is that this Court would have

.found the Codine. Temporal to be cruel and unusuhl punishment no
C

matter how .frequently it was imposed in the Philippines.

That

it was the quality, the nature of the punishment that was so shocking to a court that had grown up used to other concepts
af punishment.
0

Is that the garreting type of —*

MR. WRIGHT;

in
of

v%;sas.

Y..\

Ho, it's the punishment that was involved

f-Alted States, in which it simply imposes a number

?i.sebiXitie on a person? in essence, it was not physically

23
cruel to him.
Q

But let• 3 take ths garroting, there*<3 be a

■physica.';, aspect that’s used in son® places, would you say that
is the kind c£ unusualness to which the Constitution is
addressed?
HR. WRIGETs

I would say it certainly is, ves, sir.

hxic I freely

oncr.de, and I want to be sure I don’t

miss this point., that wa do have changing concepts heref that
what is cruel and unusual is not a static concept? that if,
for example, tomorrow someone were to invent a way of
executing condemned people that was far superior to the methods
now used in the United States, so far superior that it. bore no
comparison, I think it might be 3aid that it is cruel to
continue to use the electric chair, if you now have this
marvelous new invention available»
But the Constitution ~~ though the Constitution itself
dcsas not change/ it responds to changing circumstances, and
has to be applied in particular contexts.
I would like to turn, if I may, to the racial aspect
of these cases, particularly as they apply in the rape cases.
‘J:h-A figures are undoubtedly very troubling.
GecrgJ. .

The figures from

I think, 'are perhaps batter than those from the State

cl ieccc — : mean those from Texas are better than those from
C

vy.:.c,

But still anyone reading tha bare statistics that of

1? persons executed for rape in Texas, 30 have been Hegro, is

26
going to be considerably worried that racial prejudice has
played its part»
.ini I think it would be disingenuous to deny that
over the 47-year period covered by those figures probably it
did»

So that we pointed out in our brief that until 1954 mis-

eegenat:.on was a crime in Texas, and undoubtedly an inter­
racial rape was thought to be a particularly traumatic
event f a particularly grave disturbance of the peace of the
State and therefore likely to be punished more severely»
The figures are small»

The total number of cases of

this kind is sufficiently small# whether we look only to the
rapes or even to the murders# as Mr. Amsterdam concedes in his
brief, that it is very difficult to form any firm statistical
conclusion from them.

This at least has been the view of both

the Fourth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit.
You cannot he more than suspicious in the figures.
There is, I think., an explanation, one may not be happy to
make but that history requires that we make, about the incidence
of the death penalty at an earlier time in my State, with the
customs that it at one time had.
And 1 think that finally it would belittle what to me
is the v- ry important principle that race is utterly irrelevant
in sentencing convicted persons.

If we were to bring that

principle in today in r?pe oases, under the Eighth Amendment,
ar-:S sav, yes, we think chat race has been impermissibly used

27
in Texas and Georgia in the past, therefore we are goinq to
outlaw the death penalty for rape cases.
To the e.u tent that there is prejudice among those who
impose sentence, whether it be jurors who sentence or judges
who sentence or prosecutors who make the initial choice of going
for the death penalty or not, or going for any other crime? to
the extent that there is prejudice, that prejudice is going to
appear not only in cases in which death is the sentence but
within which other sentences are given.
Professor Bullock’s study, cited in our brief, of the
persons who were given prison sentences, shows that that is so..
But among those given prison sentences for rape there are
figures that make us wonder if race was impermissibly taken
into account by Texas jurors in years past.
It seems to me that we honor the principle on which
I nuggest ell of us would agree much better if we regard these
as being,ae they really are, equal protection arguments.

It

is a denial of equal protection of the laws if a man, because of
his color, suffers a different punishment than someone else of
a different color.

It's a vary grievous violation of the

Constitution, but I think that that’s where we ought to face
it squarely, rather than —
0

How can you face it squarely in any individual

case under the equal protection clause?
MR. WRIGHT:

‘1 suggest, Justice Stewart, that you can

28
do what, as Mr. Greenberg has told us, has been done in schools
-•snd other things where squa i protection arguments are made,
you bring forth statistics, you make your prima facie showing V
and then you say to the State 5
0

Well

Can you justify?

but this will arise in the context of an

individual prosecution, an individual conviction, and an
individual sentence of death.

^

And how, possibly, can you show

given the secrecy of the trial jury's deliberation, how, possibly
can you show it a denial of equal protection, merely by showing
that a disproportionate number of Negroes has had the death
sentence imposed upon them in the past?
do with this case, does it?

That has nothing to

X mean with ray hypothetical case.

MR. WRIGHT; -Veil, I think it would certainly have
something to do with an objection on this ground, just as the
fact that a particular jury is all white may be challenged, and
we may go back into past history and show what historical
practices have been in order to establish a pattern of dis­
crimination.
Q

But I still don't understand your answer in my

hypothetical case.

How would it ~~ how would it begin to show

a deprivation of equal protection in an individual case, to
merely show that in the past more Negroes than white people
have been given the death penalty in rape cases?
HR. WRIGHT;

It might lead one to conclude that we

T:t not ••-.How the present practices that we have for sentences.

29

Q

Then what would the result be?

To set aside that

conviction and say? henceforth no Negroes can be sentenced to
death? but wnxce
MR. 'WRIGHTi
Q

i'an be
No.

No, of course it would not fee that.

Well, what — I mesa, how could you get at it

under the equal protection clause?
MR. WRIGHT„

X think you might have to reexamine your
?
decisions of last term in McGautha and Crampton, McGautha
particularly.

X think you might have to see if jury sentencing

is a permissible method or whether jury sentencing is not so
suspect because of the likelihood that bias will play a part
that you have to take this power away from juries? but the
Court having decided so recently and so decisively that jury
sentencing is proper? that the jury dess express the conscience

of the community? 1 would think you'd need quite a powerful
showing to change the Court's mind.
Q

Well? Professor, you indicate that it would be

quito proper, under your view of the Eighth Amendment at least,
you say you accept some prior cases suggesting the proportion™
ality of principles.
MR, WRIGHT:
Q

pnh-hunh.

So, I take it, that it's a legitimate question

presented to this Court as to whether, for example, rape where
there * s been no bodily harm other than the rape is justifi- —
is cause for the death penalty?

30
KR. WRIGHT: That is certainly a legitimate question,.
yes.
Q

Perfectly straightforward —

MR. WRIGHTi Absolutely. That seems to me to be
properly what the partias are here.
Q

That‘s what this case is all about?

MR. WRIGHTs
Q

Yes.

That's what this case is all about,

What's your argument about rap© as distinguished

from other crimes?
MR. WRIGHT:

My argument, first# is that one can

or a State Legislature reasonably can say that there are some
rapes sufficiently serious that# for purposes of retribution
and deterrence, the State ought be allowed to provide the death
penalty.

That it would be doctrine there in the extreme to

say that no rape is so bad.
We can take a variant of the case that Justice Marshall
put to counsel in the case preceding me:

Suppose we have the

rape victim who is traumatised for life, really a cripple
psychologically, as a result of this experience.

That the

legislature would net bo acting irrationally or improperly to
say that for this kind of a very serious case, death is an
appropriate penalty.
if that is so. then the question becomes:

Can one

constitutionally draw a line to separate some rapas from others?
I think that every cue of us would be horrified if every rapist

31
were given the death penalty, >; ©cause some rapes , as Justice
Stewart suggested earlier, are not aggravated n£ fairs, in any

sense.
This is that the Fourth Circuit has undertaken in
Haloh v. Warden.

I thi k that the position taken there by the

majority, speaking through Judge Butaner, that you can impose
death only for rapes in which life has been endangered is a
wholly unworkable position; that life is endangered in
substantially any rape.

And that this would become a question

of very arbitrary proof.
We developed that line in our brief.

I will try not,

to repeat what we said there.

Clearly there is more force to the position taken by
Chief Judge Kaynsworth in the Fourth Circuit, that you can

impose death for rapes only if serious physical or psychological
harm has resulted.

This is at least a more objective test.

My difficulties with it are twos

First, I think that

in the present imperfections of knowledge that it is very
difficult to say with confidence whether or not serious
psychological harm has resulted? second, I cannot think that
the Constitution permits drawing of lines that refined.
Q

Professore Wright, under Texas practice, is the

evidence as to the element of damage to the prosecutrix
ordinarily introduced in evidence in a rape prosecution?
that a necessary element of the crime?

Is

WHIG-;. 5;

? tbinl: vot

Just .tea Rehnquist»

That,

Is why there was nc record of it here, that it’s the fact that
the rape occurred 3;id how it occurred that was enough to
establish a complete ca ;a under Texas law, and therefore it
neaar occurred to anyone to put or- evidence one way or the
other whether or not M2?3« Stowe suffered any hara»
Q

Mr. Wright, in a prior term, X think two years

ago, and earlier in this terra we*ve had arguments about jury
problems, and the arguments in those cases all tended to
emphasize, or a great many of them did, that ..the jury is the
barrier between the individual citizen defendant and the
harshness of the lav?, considered to be much safer than having
a judge do it alone.
Sow, in this case we seem to be having arguments that
the jury fixing the penalty, and I think you almost subscribe to
that, a jury fixing the penalty may be a dangerous thing fob
a defendant.
MR. WRIGHT:

X would be hard-put, Mr. Chief Justice,

to form a judgment on whether, over-all, it’s a good thing or a
bad thing for a criminal defendant to have a jury trial.

I

take it that the Sixth Amendment is simply, for the present,
to at least resolve the question that he ought to have one if
he wants one.
I do think that there is a possibility of prejudice,
not only on racial grounds, on other grounds when you have a

33
jury setting the sahtenco, and that perhaps judges can be
be cfcar disciplir.’f: v
pe:.;iseurci.>; new io;

less» likely to do that; but 1 note the

oellate review of sentences; in the federal

system., inhere we do not use jury sentencing; so that I guess
that even judges are hardly acting scientifically on the
sentencing.
Q

Well, Professor, didn’t jury sentencing arise

out of some desire to mitigate the harshness of criminal
p enalties?
I'm sure that that a the origin of it,

MR.

«Justice White, yes, sir*
Q

And, historically, hasn't it been — or would

you say it's been successful in that regard, or not?
MR. WRIGETs

I would say that it was successful.

Whether we nsec juxy sentencing today to achieve that purpose,
given our advances and other marginal matters, I don't know.
v

But in the — specifically in the context of the

death penalty, that has been the result?
MR. WRXGBT:

Oh, yes.

Yes.

Thank you.
MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Wright.

Mr» Bruder, do you have anything further?
MS. BRUDERs

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

iI*G0M2BIT OF MELVYN CARSON bruder, esq. ,

OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, BRUDERs

A few anwers.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist

asked about the evidence with respect to the harm done to the
prosecutrix in a raps case.
It has consistently bean held admissible by the Court
of Criminal Appeals as part of the res gestae.

I believe the

record in this case shows that. Mrs. Stowe, the complaining
witness, went to the home of her son, took a bath, and never
even sought the aid of a doctor.
Consequently? 1 would assume from that that there
was no medical testimony available, held the State decided to
put some on.
The answer is they could have put some on.
Q

It's your position that they could have.

I take

it they weren't required to in order to prove any essential
element of the crime?
MR. BRUDER:

No, the Court of Criminal Appeals has

consistently held that the prosecutrix’s testimony as to
penetration and

bo

forth is sufficient and need not be

corroborated.
In answer to the other question about the frequency
of application of Article 1.14.

It is the precise application

of Article 1.14 is unusual and is not common outside of the
State of Texas.

35

■there 5 re tvc points that Professor Wright has made
that

1

think bear some searching*
First of all, he says Professor Amsterdam's argument

that society is now reprised by the use of the death penalty is
refuted because the majority of the States have, the death
penalty, ergo, the death penalty is acceptable to the majority
of Americans.
however,, no argument is advanced in support of the
proposition that a minority of the States have the death
penalty for rape only* ergo, it is unusual.
I think the fact that the minority of States have
retained the death penalty for rape only leads to the conclusion
drawn by the majority in 'Ralph v«, Warden*
The other point that is made by the brief and not
made quote so strongly is the fact that retribution is
recognised by the State of Texas as a very important part of
punishment.
Y

I would think that it would be extremely hard to
justify retribution, where the purpose of retribution is pure
vengeance*

If you haven't got a life taken, how do you justify

the taking of life?

Are you doing something greater, punishing
i

greater than the crime itself?
This is where the proportionality or Weems comes
in.o play, and this is where, 1 believe, this Court has the
rifpt to determine proportionality of punishment and to draw

36
Lnes with respect to rape., and to work out standards.

And if

standards cannot bo worked out, then, in any event, to at least
send the cases back to the State Legislatures and let them
establish standards', such as Mevada did»
Q

Then you would argue that capital punishment for

treason is cruel and unusual?
MR. BRUDERs Exactly.
Q

If no life is taken.

MR. BRUDER:
Q

Or armed robbery.

Kidnapping?

MR. BRUDER;
Q

Or —

Anything where there is no real threat —

Hijacking?

MR. BRUDER:

— endangering the life of the accused.

To me you are taking a life for something less than what has
occurred.

There is absolutely no reason, based on retribution,

in that point; and of course the other purposes of punishment
do not apply.
Q

Then your answer to my question is in the

a£ firmative?
MR, BRUDERi

It would be cruel and unusual; any case

r...or'.: homicide or another capital case where more than simply
showing a gun to the victim is proved by the State, I would
think that —
0

What about treason that resulted in the cost of

10,000 soldiers?

37
MR* BRUDEE:

If that was provable, I would say that

the da&fch oen&lty would not be cruel and unusual*

Q

Texas —

Wallg you can’t — 1 don't see how you can draw

that line* you just say it is if it doesn’t involve that, person
injuring somebody.
MR* BRUDERs Well* it could involve any death or
endangering any person.

Now* that is not to say that you may

not have more than an immediate victim*
once or twice removed.

You may have a victim

In the case of treason, the delivery

of secret plans which may cost the life of other men.

have victims which are

You would

the fact that they are dead or injured

can be shown to foe a result of the act.
Q

What would you say to an attempt on the

Pre sideni8 s life?
MR* BRUDER:
Q

Unless tfrare are facts I can cite -

The facts are that he. had a machine gun loaded

with .£0 Caliber bullets, and somebody grabbed him just before
he pulled the trigger.
MR. BRUDERs

I can see no real distinction between

the attempt on the President’s life and the attempt on any
person’s life; and unless there are medical facts in a record
showing some sort of injury to the person, I can see no reason
for the taking of life.
The taking of life, in my opinion, and I think .in the
opinion of the majority in the Ralph case, must necessarily

38
depend upon fcl 10 ham which is done.
.

*cii0 i't&jaa dona, not exceed it.
Q

Tha punishment must be made
Th d2 taking of life ~~

What do you do with this theory when yon get to

prison sentences?

MR. BRUDER:
Q

I'm sorry, I didn’t get that?

• What if you:8re not •- in talking about — in

putting capital punishment to one side, how does your theory
apply to teras of imprisonment, for example?
MR, BRUDE1% ■ i think there was none, because, taking
into recognition the advance techniques that we're now aware
of that are being used in prison systems, I think sentencing
now has become more a function of parole boards and experienced
people in the penitentiary system,
Q

My question, Mr. Bruder is this::

you suggest

that, at least arguendo, at least as a secondary argument in

t'.' .fc' particular case, that whatever may be the constitutionally y
of imposing the death sentence for deliberate, premeditated
murder, it cannot be imposed for rape, or indeed for any other
offense unless a human life has been taken.

That's your

argument, isn't it?
MS. BRUDER;

Or endanger to such & degree that medical

attention was necessary to save the life.

Q

Then 1 just wondered where that theory got you

with respect to something like assault and battery.

What’s

constitutional outer limit for the punishment for that?

3S
Under the Eighth Amendment.
MR. BRUGESs

under the Eighth Amendment, X see no

limitation as far as what the legislature of the States may do.
Because -Q

It’s not an important question, really.

HR. BRUDERt

The main thing is the taking of the

life. ThatTs the thing that distinguishes the rape case from
the murder case, and the rape case from anything.

You’re

taking the life without demonstrable evidence that the taking
of life war necessary and flows from the act; it is unusual,
ana that may make it cruel as well.
Q
distinction.

Mr. Bruder, X want to be sure I get your
You said no death penalty for rape unless there

is substantial medical evidence.
. MR• BRUDER;

I did not ~ not necessarily substantial.

Medical evidence, showing that some harm had occurred.
Q

Some harm had occurred?
/

MR. BRUDER: Some harm had occurred.

Some physical

harm, and that perhaps, but for medical attention, there
would have been problems.

How serious the problems may be is,

I don’t think — it may not even be a question to this Court,
it may really be a question for the legislatures.
0

Now you say some physical harm, you’re not

excluding mortal breakdown?
BRUtSRs

I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have excluded it

A0

If there is t*. rkimony of some disorder of the mind as a
result of it, I think that would also be a very important
factor in whether or not the death penalty was permissible.
Q

And you’re not drawing any distinction between

the degree of ham?
harm.,

It could be slight, as long as it is some

2 just want to know where you draw the line.
MR, BRDDEPs Well, 1 would disagree —I would draw a

line at some point.

The harm would have to be of such a

nature that it might lead to incapacity or even death.
For instance, in the Branch case, the mere pressing
of the arm across the throat, which did not necessitate medical
attention, I don’t see how that could possibly be serious harm,
such as to justify the taking of a life.

Because, as I said

originally, in Texas a man could beat a woman to the brink of
death and still only get 25 years if she recovered, under our
assault statutes.
But if he beat her to the brink of death and raped
her, perhaps ho could gst life.

Xt would be inconsistent, and

thus it might be a question for the Texas Legislature to
resolve, because of the internal inconsistencies.
But X think the necessity for drawing that line is
clear under the cruel and unusual prohibition of the Eighth
AsiomSiaent, and that the least this Court should do in this
case, in any event, is to remand the case so that this line can

bt drawn, much as in the-: Nevada case? and much as has been

41
proposed by the model draft in Texas, which has not been enacted.
Q

Mr. Bruder,, under your theory of the Eighth

Amendment, would a court martial ba constitutionally entitled
to impose the death penalty upon a member of the military for
desertion in the face of the enemy?
MR, 3RUDER:

Well, there are two interesting problems.

First of all, you're dealing with a non-civilian and probably
a non-peacetime crime.

And the second problem is obviously

how do you show whether or not that act contributed to death
or injury to somebody else?

1 would think if there is any probative evidence
shewing the contribution to injury or death, the answer would
be yes,
Q

But if not, no?

MR. BRUDER;

If not, by using these standards, if

these standards apply to civilian peacetime crimes and wartime
military crimes, the answer would be that it would be cruel
and unusual.
MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Bruder.

Thank you, Mr. Wright.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2s53 o'clock, p.m., the case was
submitted.3
