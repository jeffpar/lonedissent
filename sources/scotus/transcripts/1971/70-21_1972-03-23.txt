GRM ARGUMENT OF ShJSFORD JAY ROSEN, ESQ*,

CM BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, ECSSN?

Mr. Chief Justice», and may it please the

Court s

This case involves the constitutionality of Ohio
Revised Code, Section 3517,07, which imposes political tests
on access to the ballot in Ohio.
The statute is set out in the Appendix at pages 12
and 13,
Ths statute precludes from the ballot in Ohio
election, and if I may quote briefly from the statute, “Any
v

political party or group which advocates, either directly or
indirectly, the overthrow, by force or violence, of our local,
vtate, or national government or which carries on a program
of sedition or treason by radio, speech, or press or which
las in any manner any connection with any foreign government
or power or which in any manner has any connection with any
group or orgonisaticn bo connected or so advocating the over­
throw, by force or violence, of * them various governments*
BKcvptod from this requirei-uent of the statute, that

the party, to get on the ballot, actually meets these tests,
ares

parties and groups that have a placa on the bailee in e&cu

national and gubernatorial election in Ohio since 1900«
There are only two parties that moot that fcesr, or course those
are the Democratic and Republican parties.
Under the statute to secure a ballot position —
q

Wall, you're certainly not suggesting that, in the

absence of the exception they .couldn’t get on the ballot in
this State?
ms.

ROSEN:

Of course not, Your Honor.

I'm implying

an argument that X'lX get to somewhat later, which is an
equal protection argument*

That by exempting any parties frosts

this requirement, the State is drawing an invidious classifica­
tion .

and x will come to that argument, if I may, Your Honor*'
But under the statute, parties that do have to meat

these tests in fact have to submit an affidavit, signed by ten
members of the party or group, three of whom are to be
executive officers of the party.
After the affidavit, in the form of the statute, is
executed and filed with tjhe secretary of state, the secretary
of state is requirad to* conduct his own investigation of the
facts appearing on the affidavit, and to make his own
determination of whether the party or group should be on the
ballot.
Mow, the plaintiffs brought suit in 19 TG

challenging

5

ia as well as • any number of other Ohio provisions.
but thc-rj'; p:;-msisi-s which t?®re in the litigation have all
Shed out of the suit by subsequent action of the
Legislature of Ohio.
We ■KA-ght injunctive and declaratory relief from a
three-judge statutory court, and May S, 1970, the district
com-t

declared the provision in the statute of Ohio unconstitu­

tional on it

ut readi

the confer

? tg and onl;

decision of the Ohio Supreme Court on this statute, the State
ssc yel. Seek v. gamrael case, to narrow the statute.

The

Court upheld the statute as construed, and thus the Court held
that the statute now means — and this is quoted in the
Appendix at page 62 — that an oath is required that Cl) the
party is not engaged in an attempt to overthrow the government

by force cr violence, (2) the party does not carry on a
program of sedition or treason as defined by the. criminal law
old (31- the parry is not knowingly associated with a group
attempting to overthrow the government by force or violence .
Plaintiffs appealed from the denial of their
i»;* uaction, rcio:Iding the statute as construed; defendants
cron s-appealed from so much of the decision of the three™
judge district court, holding the statute unconstitutional

on its face.
Plaintiffs request this Court to reverse and! remand
v.-.vVi- cb.rcctics a to the district court to declare: the entire

6

be unconstitutional and .to enjoin, its enforcement in the
future.
There are several reasons why this statute is
unconstitutional.

Some of these reasons go to the statute on

its face, some go to the statute as construed and interpreted

by the district court:, with the assistance of the Ohio Supreme
Court„ and some relate to both.
It's the position of plaintiff that the starting
point for analysis of this statute is an appreciation of the
importance of the right to vote and to gain access to the
ballot.
This: Courtf in numerous decisions over the last
decade, has held, for example as in West bury i ys_. Sanders ,
that no right ir; mors precious in a free country than, that of
having a voice i.n fcho election of those who make the laws
under which, as good citizens, we must live.
Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if
the right to vote is undermined.
It’s our first position in this case, Your Honors,
that there is an absolute right on the part of the electorate
to vote for candidates for public office without the State
interposing any kind of a screen between that right to vote,
anu access to the ballot.
Q
it?

•;'his wasn't a three-judge district court, was

MR. ROSRH8
judge court.

Yes, it was, Your Honor.-

It was a three-

If you recall, the case did coma up as one of

two consolidated cases involving a broad-gauged attack to a
number of Ohio election provisions.

And, as I suggested, most

of those provisions have been mooted out of the case by
legislative action.
Q

By legislative action.

MR. ROSEN:
Q

Right.

Tight.

MR. RCSENs And this is the only provision that
appears to remain-.
Okay.
Me think that there is a very substantial First
Amendment component to the right to vote, and we believe that
this Court has recognised that, substantial First Amendment
component.
In the predecessor to this case, Williams vs. diode:.,
for example, the decision by Justice Black on equal protection
grounds started off from an. appreciation of the fact that
the right of individuals to associate for advancement of
political beliefs, and the right of qualified votens,
regardless of their political persuasion, to cast their voter
effectively is s. fundamental right and was the i/
in that cart.leu?ar czs:oAnd., indeed,remains the issue in
this case.

8
>?or our first position on this lew is that Ohio
has no right to interpose any kind of a 'political test for the
vote itself, and for access to the ballot.

The question of

what Ohio may do in terms of qualifying elected officials when
it comes time for them to take their oath of office is not a
question before this Court.

Wesre not even at that point.

So we would submit that not even the oath of office
contemplated in Article VI of the Constitution of the United
States is appropriate.
Wow, on the other hand, should the Court be reticent
about taking this particular step in this ease, our second
position is that Article VI of the Constitution, which provides
for a constitutional oath of office for all elected officials
in the United States, read together with Amendment Ho. 1,
has to mean that at most, in terms of political credentials,
speech and association credentials of candidates for public
office, parties on the ballot.

All that can be required is a

test basically in the form of an Article VI affidavit or oath
of office.
We believe that this, although it is not the holding
of the Court in the case of Bond vs. Floyd, involving access
to the legislature in the State of Georgia, and it's not of
course the holding of the case in this Court’s decisions in
Powe11 vs. MeCormack, involving the Court’s ability to review
a determination by the Congress that a member should be refused

9
his seat, and holding that the House is limited in its
consideration only fco those constitutional requisites which
the member must meet, and which are set forth.
These two decisions do imply vary strongly that the
most that the State may require is the Article VI type of
test.
We would refer the Court as well to a number of State
court decisions, the leading on© of which, although dealing
?

with State constitutional law, is

Emfcerv

not cited in our brief, unfortunately.

vs. Marsh.

It’s

It’s a decision of

Chief Justice Vanderbilt of the New Jersey Supreme Court,
and its reference is 71 Atlantic 2d 352, 3 N„J. 578, in which •
Chief Justice Vanderbilt, faced with a State lav; of New
Jersey, which added to the qualifications for ballot access
and for office as an elected official, things that were not
contemplated in the constitutional oath provided under
Federal and State Constitutions.
The Court ruled quite clearly that the constitutional
oath requirement brooked no additions whatsoever.
9
On this point, the Court might also refer to Shupp
t

vs. Simpson, which is cited in our brief, the Maryland Court
of Appeals decision, although it disavowed the Embery case so
far as State offices are concerned, it clearly accepted the
.‘.Sabery rationale on a preemption basis so far as federal
elected officers are concerned.

10
Mow,.in addition to our first two points, ws have a
■number which are perhaps more fully briefed in our brief.
The first of -— our third point on the unconstitutionality of
this Ohio provisions pertains to the statute's invasion of
the right to political association.
screen candidates, as such.

The statute doesn't even

It's not a requirement that a

candidate execute an oath, which was precisely the question
before this Court in the Gerende case, of which the district
court below made much.

That's not the question in this ease.

What we have here is a statute which presumes to
screen political congeries, associations, groups and parties
and keep them off of the ballot.
We submit that cases like Gibson vs. Florida Legis­
lative 'Investigating,.Committee, N&ACP__v._ Alabama would suggest
that such a statute is at least constitutionally
presumptively unconstitutional.
In addition, since the statute requires that ten
members of the party, whether candidates or not, only three
of whom are to be officers of the party, must execute the
affidavit, there's a direct invasion of the associations!
rights of those .individuals, as indicated in the SheIton and
Bates decisions, and the decisions involving the Subversive
Activities Control Act, and the registration requirements for
C0;1 munist~action Organisations? Albertson vs. CP, and the like.
This statute, in addition, is unconstitutionally

II
overbroad.

It's perfectly clear the statute on its face,

If all br-:, Court had before it was the statutory language,
is unconstitutionally broad.
We fully brief that point, and I won't go over it,
the statute on its face in terras of the overbreadth.
The State does suggest that the statute,is still
constitutional on its face, but the district court below
certainly held to the contrary.
We Submit that even if construed by the Supreme Court
of Ohio in the Bask case, the statute is unconstitutionally
broad, and, indeed, the district court below misread the
Supreme Court of Ohio's decision.
It's ©ur position that the Supreme Court of Ohio,
in narrowing, the statute, only narrowed it to the point of
drawing a distinction between violence or engaging in violence,
but including in that category mere advocacy of violence or
violent overthrow; and, on the other hand, peaceable change,
as through use of the amendment process,
h careful reading of the decision of the Supreme
Court of Ohio, I think, will make that clear.

In addition,

I think that, although there are no other Ohio Supreme Court
decisions on point, there are a number of Ohio lower court
decisions dealing with analogous statutes which seem to
indicate, as well, that their understanding of the law in
Ohio was that the distinction ?:

etween violenc

12
■

■

satol«

Even as interpreted by -the district court below,
>r, the statute remains unconstitutionally broad»

Again,,

to a large extent, this point is taken up in our argument? Is11
ju:t mention the two most notable aspects of the overbreadth
of the statute as construed by the district court.
First, the district court, in its narrowing construc­
tion of statutes, speaks of the party knowingly associated,
or associating with a group attempting to overthrow government
by force or violence.

We submit that the use of the term

"knowingly associated" is too open-ended. Sven though this
term itself is too open-ended, in addition we submit that the
criterion established by the district court does not take
account of the numerous decisions of this Court, which hold
that mere knowing association, membership in, or participation
in a. group which is engaged in or advocating violent overthrow is not enough.

There must be specific intent on the part

of the person or, in this case, party associating to further
or fulfill the unlawful goals of the organization which is
engaged in the unlawful act or advocacy.
q

' Then, 1 gather, Mr. Rosen, you extend your

cverbreadth argument to either elements one or two of the
district court's construction?
MR. ROSENi
as such.

We don't extend the overbreadth argument

I do extend the next point, which of course is a

13
vagueness pointf to points one and two»

st say, to the extent
i means, the party is not engaged in an attempt to overthrow
the government by force or violence, it would be difficult for
us to argue that that’s overbroad, assuming that the inquiry
can be made or this investigation can be made, and we don’t
concede that.
It seeras a silly thing to ask somebody to make an
affidavit about, since it's speaking of the immediate present
and this instant, and has no reference to future behavior or
activity; but I suppose we couldn’t say it’s overbroad.

If

anything, it’s incredibly narrow.
However, we do think that there may be some vagaries
involved in that particular language.

Less in that point one,

except as read with the statute itself, than in the point two.
The party dees not carry on a program of sedition or treason,
as defined by the criminal law*
Well, I suppose we know what treason means under
the criminal lav-.

I assume, and I think the Court would

assume, that treason would be limited by Article III of the
Constitution to mean making war on the United States or any
of them, «md adhering — or adhering to their enemies, proven,
according to the two-witness rule, ©rqpen confession.
And, indeed, I believe there is an Ohio statute on
treason, though I don’t know that it has ever been enforced.

t; raver, there is no sedition law in Chio»

The

closest thing to a sedition law in Ohio was the criminal'
Syndicalism Act, which this Court declared was unconstitutional
in Brandenburg 'ts . Ohio 8
jurisprudence

There is no referrent in Ohio

at all for a meaning for the term ttsedition".

And of course this Court has recognised, and I have reference
to your language, Mr. Justice Brennan, on.the difficulty the
Court has with the use of those two words, "sedition" and
t; treason8, and the difficulty of defining them.
But that is quoted in the brief, and ws would rest on
that proposition, so far as the construction by the district
court is concerned.

These are the primary vague provisions

in this newly construed statute.

But again we don't agree that

the district court was correct in its construction, in light
of the Supreme Court of Ohio’s view.
We think it’s perfectly clear, further, that the
vagueness that’s found in the statute and the ovarbreadth is
incredibly magnified by the deprivations of due process of
law in a procedural sense that are found in the statute.
First, there63 c burden of going forward, which is placed
immediately upon the party.
This statute requires that an affidavit be submitted
on. behalf of the political party or group.

It seems to us

that that kind of a requirement is interdicted by this Court’s
decision in Speiser v. Randall,

once you’re in the First

tsancfeenfc area.

Further, the affidavit isn't enough*

It's

not oven presumptively dispositive of the facts of not being
subversive or not fitting within the statute.

The statute

provides that the secretary of state shall undertake an
independent investigation, and the evidence of the kind of
investigation that the secretary of state is likely to conduct
is presented in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio, in
the Beck v. Hummel case.
It was cursory and anfci-Firsfc Amendment at best, and
so the Supreme Court of Ohio itself found in that particular
case»
In the course of the investigation, the Supreme Court
of Ohio ruled that the secretary of state need provide no

heavingr none whatsoever.
gation .

He can do his own ax parte investi­

A clear offense to procedural due process.
And, further•• the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that

once ha made his findings and certified that the party or group
should not have access to the ballot, and should not be placed
upon the ballot, the Supreme Court ruled they would review,
they and the other Ohio courts review according to a test of
substantial evidence? whether there is substantial evidence,

>: as.3urns the ■ court meant» on the record as a whole to support
thu tecicio» of the secretary of state.

.

Although the test may not be even as generous' to the
par:;r e.-.’cuo e;:? the :v-b::fantial-evidence rule, because the

16
co.urfc also specks about reviewing according to a determinat ion
whether they will overrule the secretary of state,, only if the
finding;, hi;;: fi;-.ding is manifestly against - the weight of the
evidence.
Much too stringent an evidentiary test under this
Court * s decisi*;;. in Sgeiser v« Randall, Connell va> Higgin­
botham, and tew Students Association vs. Wadraan.
So, again, another constitutional infirmity in this
scheme.
And, finally, to return to the point that Justice
Stewart, brought out in his question, we think all of these
defects are further magnified by the fact that there is an
exemption for parties with a great deal of continuous longevity
on the ballot ir the State of Ohio, those two parties of
course being the Democrats and Republicans.
t';> dor.•t imply at this time that either of those
parties would have difficulty securing a ballot'position under
the tests of this statute, even as construed, assuming we
quite understand, what they are.
chat re do mean to imply is. your observation,
Justice Stewart, in Jennass vs» Fortson, where you saidi
tica after time established political parties at local, state,
and national levels have, while retaining their old labels,
changed ideological direction because of influence and
leadership of those with unorthodox or "radical" views.

1?
‘fae history of these United States is replete with
vv .«pies of charges of ideological direction on the part of
political parties in the United States»

I just reviewed a

doouitent the t ho.f Lean prepared by the former secretary of
state of Ohio, ca the election experience in Ohio over a long
period of time,, from the beginning of the Republic to the
present.

I counted 37 separate political parties, of whom 1

know at least 10 engaged in one type of metamorphosis or
another, of which several were wore or lass revolutionary fore

their time, including the abolitionist- party.
Presumably, that party might not be able to secure
ballot position in Ohio today, if it attempted to go on the
ballot.
How, on the basis of these various defects, it is
Ut; appellants5 position that the decision of the court below
should be reversed, the case remanded, and with instructions
to enjoin the operation of the statute.
I'd like to reserve the rest for rebuttal.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Very well, Mr. Rosen.
Mr. Guifcfcar.
OR-1 ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. GUITTAR, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

MR, GUITTAR:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

18

T
V

iaxisaa

iiis to answer the first objection which has
,

which is a questica. of tne violation of duct

process, procedural due process.

I thia.k if the Court will examine the Ohio case of
Beck vs« Hummel, you will find out that the Ohro courv. and
,h::: Ohio law dees not run afoul of the previous decisions of
this Court, such as Sgeiser, for this reasons

The secretary of

state of the State of Ohio makes a detensinEt 2-on on the ba&.cs
of the affidavit:.

It is true that that is a unilateral

determination.
The nc:xt step is, he then refuses to certify and
put the party on the ballot.
The next step, then, is that the person, or 1' mean
the party must go to court.

At this point, and in the Becx

ease the Ohio Supreme Court held that the affidavit has a
presumption in its favor of good faith and truth and that the
secretary of state in answering that: has got co overcome
presumption.

- •:~

And, further, that the secretary of state has

v;at to come forward with substantial evidence.
So this is not the usual situation, this is not the
situation which the Court had before it such as in the
c&3Q» in which the entire burden of overturning an adnexae;
.1’rLnietrativo determination was put on the part of the tax­

payer.
Q

'

'

'

19
why is this a case or controversy?

Did somebody refuse to

put these people on the ballot because of a lack i» the
affidavit?
ME, G-iTlT&P.:

no, Mr* Justice Stewart.

Labor Party refused to execute the affidavit.

The Socialist

If you’ll

escaridne the pleadings, they felt, that they had just pled as
their third cause of action, just the alleged confiet, the
statute, and then they pled the conflict.
Unfortunately, I cannot give you the fullest

■:

factual answer that I would like to, Mr. Justice Stewart,
because I was not present at the time, or at the trial.
Q

But ~-~

This is the third cause of action, isn’t it,

to you, beginning on page. 12 of the Appendix?
MR. GUITTAR: That's correct.

Q

1 have it right.

And they recite, they quote

the language of the statute, and they say it's unconstitutional,
then they say, in paragraph 21, that unless they are granted
relief they will be irreparably injured; but they don’t say
how or why.

Do they?

MR. GUITTARs
Q

No, they do not.

I wondered if they refused to file an

affidavit and were# for that reason, denied a place on the
\.:ii

.'T

fa

filed an, affidavit, and that the secretary of state

found it’deficient?
MR. GUITTARs

It’s xny understanding, based upon a

20
fcr^nraription which 1 had made of the oral argument» frost» the
stufce^i-.nt of the attorn*;/'for the Socialist Labor Party, that
they had- refused to execute the affidavit.

books of the Ohio General Code, and we don't

that's about what they said, is it not?

MR. GUITTAR: That’s correct.

But they say more than that, they say it’s

unconstitutional.
MR. GUITTAR:
Q

E;ut they don't nay how they're harmed.

MR. GUITTAR:
q

That's right, then they —

Ho, they do not.

The case was decided on summary judgment,

wasn't it?
HR. GUITTAR:

Yes, it was, Mr. Justice ReWuist.

I think that — I do - not recall whether any harm is
alleged in the prayer subsequent to the pleading of the third
cause of action.
However,- I holior® you're correct, Mr* Justice

it. w ..W,

X hali&ra Chat the standard of substantial evidence,
which the Ohio Supreas Court, in the Seek case, placed upon
■

■

procedural defective allegations which the plaintiffs have
raised here.
1 world like to pass on next to the. question of tha
statute itself.

I believe it's fair to say that if this

Court h&s stoker out against any words , any particular words
an*;'. condemned them for vagueness, the words are ths word
“advocacy* and its use in loyalty oaths.

The Court has

repeatedly condemned the use of that language.
If tL°. Court wishes to apply that to a political
party statute, s political party oath, then certainly this
statute of the State of Ohio is unconstitutionally vague, and
the ordinary person could not tell from the use of the word
‘‘•'advocacy” add so on whether he was in fact violating that
statute.
With the reservation that we deal here with a
political party, and the practicality of the matter is not
that any individual is punished, but that, it is solely that,
a political party label or name does not go on the ballot.
I thirk in examining the cases which;the Court has
daoi led in the area of loyalty oaths r I think i*c would be welx
vo take in vine that there is no discharge and no dismissal
rroblas'i here so the Court has had before it so many times,

State through requiring the oath as restricted by the district
court.
Q

What is the interest of the State?

MR. GUITTAR:
Q

The interest is •—

It's not — if I understand you correctly, it:s

not that this man will hold office.

Right?

MR. GlTTTARs That's correct, Mr, Justice Marshall,
and the statute really does not operate against a man.

A man

can go on the ballot, but he. can't have a party label on it,
if the affidavit has not bean executed.
Q

Even if the man is the most loyal citisen in

the world, and he wants to run under that label, ha can’t?
MR. GUITTAR: Well, I believe, Mr. Justice Marshall,
that an examination of the Beck decision by the Ohio Supreme
tourt shows that: if the Communist Party itself ware to tender
this oath, that the Oahio Supreme Court has recognised the
fact that someone is a Communist does not necessarily mean that
they believe in force or violence.
Q
:>£

But my point is that a man who is not a member

this party and who doesn’t advocate anything but good,

did Americani?.!mr plus motherhood, wants to run on that label,

23
he can't?

I believe he can*

If they don’t fi-.e an

MR. eciTTAR: Well, yes, he would have to file the
affidavit? they would have to file the affidavit.
q

But he couldn't — there's no way for him to

run unless they file the affidavit?
MR. GUITT&R:

Under the party label, that’s right.

That’s right.
In other words, that loyal individual
q

Well, what is the interest that Ohio has in

that?
MR. GUITTARs

Well, Ohio, I think it’s fair to say,

cannot have any interest in keeping loyal American citizens
off, aiid citizens of Ohio, off the ballot? and 1 don’t believe
that this ~
0

well, is it to keep disloyal parties off the

ballot?
MR. GUITTARs
was unfortunate»

Well, my use of the word "disloyal”

That is not part of the district court s

reading»

become elected and to use the offices of the State in an

MR. GUITTARs

With respect to the State’s interest

in avoiding that to which I just referred, I believe this
■lo:Tt has iy.pl.ioitly recognised cr explicitly recognised this
interest in the

cas e, in the Doud case , and implicitly

26
in the Gerendo case.
Moving along, to the Court{s ori ion below, and the
restricted reading which the court gave this statute below,
with respect to Item No. 1 of this Constitution, I believe
it fully constitutional.-There are no cases cited, nor can
there be any, which do anything other than sustain the
constitutionality of the language required, namely, that one
should not be attempting — that the party should not be
attempting or engage in an attempt to overthrow the government
by force and violence.
MR. CEIEP JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we'll resume right

after lunch on that point.

Guittar.
MY, GtflTTAR:

‘Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Courts
With respect to going to the second limitation, which
the district court below placed upon the Ohio statute 3BX?.C?„
the second limitation — the first being that the party is
not engaged in an attempt to overthrow the government by force
or violence.

The second one, the party does not carry on a

program of sedition' or treason, as defined by the criminal law.
As my brother points out in his brief, there is no
Ohio criminal law defining sedition.

But there is for treason.

Anil that is substantially. the same as the treason which is
provided by the federal law.
And the treason citation is 2921.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code, and has to do with the levying award.
With respect to — 1 would like to point out to the
Court that in the Keyishian case, this Court has specifically
validated from vagueness the nr : of the word "treason” with
respect to oaths.
With respect to the third provision, it is that ft .
party is not knowingly associated with a group attempting to
overthrow the government, X believe that there is sufficient

28
scienter in there both from the decision of the Ohio Supreme
Court and the scienter which can be implied from this Court * $
case in Gerendef which was approved in Baggett and also White­
hall.,
At page 13? of the Back case, the Qhie Supreme Court,
with respect to this question, stated that the individuals
involved must be, personally, personally engaged. in these
activities.
But, further, if the Court should find that there’s
no sufficient scienter in the third limitation placed on the
oath, we suggest that the Keyishian ceise, which requires you
must have a specific intent to further the illegal aims of
the organisation, would be a proper further limitation»
We believe, for all the reasons,that the oath as
limited is not unduly vague, and can be understood

by those

who are required to sign it on behalf of a party.
With respect to the equal protection claim, violations
thereof, X believe it's a legitimate State interest and can
reasonably bo legislated by the State Legislature that part.low
who have perpetually participated in the election process ova:,
the yoars, and parties who have not had anyone utilise the

v?i;nce< that is a perfectly proper e f

anything further?
FETiTTM, ARGUMENT OF SANFORD JAY ROSEN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
HR. ROSENi
Q

If I may, Mr. Chief Justice.

1« r,. Rosen, may I ask you a question?

Justice

Stewart asked Mr. Guittar as to the steps that the party has
actually taken to gat on the ballot in Ohio.

And I notice

that there ware apparently affidavits filed in connection with
tiie motion for simoaary judgment that I don’t find in the
appendix.
Die. thorn affidavit?; offer any additional information
ban the pleadings, as to what had been done by th<

30

party towards getting on the ballot?

MR,

Your Yoaor, I can't honestly say.

haven't seen those affidavits in a while, myself»
recall where they are in the file*

X

And I doast

But your question, it

seems to me, is a broader question addressed to precisely the

conside rations that Mr. Justice Stewart was raising , and
that was the first point that X did wish to make on rebuttal«
that is, how was the issue raised and why is it in
such a rathe ;• tUn status?

It may well be that the affidavits

do allege additional harm.
The is-sue was raised in the following form.# Your
Honorss
Cosriaiaf was filed on January 20, 1370.

Kow, tor

a complaint to ha filed on that day, it was impossibleP usiae^
the statute, for my clients to execute the affidavit.

Yhe

statute provides; that the affidavit must foe filed with the
secretary of . state between nine months prior to the next
election and sir months prior to the next election.
Conceivably, they might have waited a few more weeks, to
actually submit the affidavit, or to make a request for

consideration os. the ballot, for placement on the ballot
,.i-. tar

-."1

affidavit.

Or they might have tried to fulfill all

c-t ar requir aaei ts for inclusion .on the ballot, without BXi
affidavit.
Sv>.t you ha , a to recall this case has a history.

31
Shis case has bean before this Court one®, twice7 the Ohio
election lavs have been before this Court.this is the
third i.t;aa.

there was a small portion of the Ohio election
?

lass dealt with in the Siboletti case, X believe, which this
Court resolved in summary fashion earlier this term, and
of course Willi.: .vs vs, Rhodes.
And raj- clients reading Williams vs. Rhodes,, and being
cognissant of th

act that they were denied, injunctive relief

by you, Mr. Justice Stewart, and then confirmed by the Court
in Williams vs. Rhodes, for failure to prosecute their cause
of action quickly can hardly be faulted for moving at the
earliest possible opportunity to challenge as many of the
provisions of the interconnected, intertangled web of Ohio
election laws, which they believed were inhibiting their
ability to get ballot position.
Q

Well, they can’t certainly

excuse me,

q

Are they in position to challenge the ones tnsy

contest until they've complied with the ones that they can’t
argue?
MR. BOSBNs

Now, on an. oath type provision, it

hasn't been the understanding of this Court that there is a
requirement of attempt — that there's any requirement
that efforts be made to comply with the oath requirement first,

q

don’t mean to comply with the oath, but

1

mean

to comply with presumably a ministerial type of filing r@gu3.a

32
ticni; that ucy exist that you don't, quarral with.
MS. ::v'SSSJs Well,. hut, you see, as the case was
formulated, this was one of ten provisions' engaged in two
separate lawsuit:$ that ware consolidated in order to try to
bring to an end the questions over the Ohio election laws.
Our clients decided to go in one lawsuit, and to bring all of
their challenges at once.
It doe.sn*t seem to me possible that they could have
attempted, to comply by registration requirements; they
couldn’t register because they didn’t have the requisite number
of signatures at. that point.
They weren't in a position yet to attempt to certify
that they wanted to have a primary yet.
the primary provisions.

They were challening

They were challenging an entire range

of provisions, some of which had some bearing on the ripeness
or the pure ripeness of the way in which the affidavit provision
might bs dealt with.
Howt in order to bring that challenge to the
affidavit provision early enough to get complete relief before
the 1970 election, they had to bring it all in one lawsuit.
And it seems to ne that’s the reason why there wasn’t the
hind of pleading that Justice Stewart was alluding to, which
would focus on the specific harm of this kind of an affidavit.
It's my understanding, further, that the appellees
intend to enfc:-•• the statute as. construed in the future.

33
ray understanding that my clients intend to
occupy a ballot position in the 19?.?: election# and presumably
ail? attempt to havs a ballot position in subsegment
elections as well»
So they are still operating unbar the gun of thin
affidavit requirement, and the statute itself.
election, the appellee, or his

For this

• well,, 1 guess it’s not his

successor at th.cs point, presumably could refuse them a
position on the ballot, for failure to file the affidavit.
I don’t bvffiw that he is, in fact, precluding them, at this
election, but he could certainly do t

x a subsequent

election.
So for those various reasons we do believe that the
pleadings, although a bit skimpy, do assert or allege
irreparable ham and do meet the tests of pleading and state
before this Court an adequately rips controversy for disposition
by the Court»
X just wanted to address two other points that cam®
up in argument on the part of the appellee.
The if-.rst, perhaps the more minor point, is:
appellee represents to this Court that the Supreme Court of
Ohio, in Esc narae Beck vs. Hufemal, adopted a rule that the
•'

•

:

faith*
i-kr.'bcva been rereading the language of the Supreme

34
that particular point, and
'■.thing, but I find, that the Suprem

bsurt of Ohio sc •

there is no shoeing in the record before the secretary that
anyone connected with the Ohio Wallace for President coiranittee
advocates the overthrow of government by force.
And the fact that some members among the many thousands
may belong to the Communist Party, or the -Communists, may
advocate the election of Wallace, is no proof that the affidavits
In accordance with the statute were not filed in good faith,
or that At is not efficacious for the purpose for which it was
filed.
All this Supreme Court of Ohio presumably is saying is
once the affidavit is filed, the burden of going forward
shifts to the secretary, and he must take some steps to
investigate; but says nothing about the ultimate burden of
proof.
Q

Well, isn’t an affidavit presumed to be true?

If not, why do you have to have an affidavit?
I don't see how this is material in this case at all*
MS, ROSENs Well, perhaps initially i.t8s presumed to
ba true, but the next point is, Mr. Justice Marshall, once the
secretary conducts his investigation, his findings are
sucfcained unless they era not supported by substantial evidence,
or era againri the weight of the evidence; which is hardly the
AAnA of test this Court has applied in cases like Speiser and

35
other cases involving a scrutiny of administrative, determinanent rigfc
Q

Well, is there any allegation in the complaint

or in the affidavits that the party, that your clients would
refuse to execute the offer of affidavit?
MR4 ROSEN:

The complaint certainly doesn’t

specifically allege that they would refuse to do so.

But

even — 1 don’t think that’s a fatal flaw in pleading, because,
presumably, even if they executed the affidavit, they still
are subject to the burden of the statute, and that doesn’t
get them on the ballot automatically.
The other flaws in the Ohio provision and procedure
are still clearly before the Court.
I’m sorry that I'm net cognisant with the affidavits,
that supported the motion for summary judgment.
Q

When you speak of the other requirements, are

you referring to the ? percent?
MR. ROSENs

No, I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, 2 am

referring to the investigation that is to be conducted by the
secretary of state, for -him to make a determination of whether
the party should have a ballot position.

Mr. Rosen*, except for what the .affidavits

Yer;, 20 and 21 are denied.

That is all

That and the determination of the district

court, that it fe.lt it had a live controversy before it at
the time.

And certainly in view of the decision of the Suprev-

Court of Ohio in the Back case, it certainly feels like a
live controversy.

The highest court of Ohio said this is a

viable operational statute.
Ti

only other decision on point of that particular

Secondly, oven if not, the statute is still before
the Court.

Even assuming my clients were to execute such an

affidavit.
Well, the statutory machinery becomes engaged, and
that machinery does itself have .the kind of chilling eriect
which they could complain about, even after they filed the
affidavit.

It still puts upon them the burden of going

forward, the burden of ultimate proof, and provides them with
no procedural safeguards in terras of the investigation and
