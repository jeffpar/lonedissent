FURTHER ARGUMENT OF GILES K. RATCL1FFE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

MR.

RATCLIFFE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Yesterday afternoon inquiry was made, I believe by

8

Justice White, relative to the significance of some language in

9

the Trial Court's order pertaining to the inability of the defen

10

11

dant or his counsel to prepare a transcript from memory.
The reason for this is, the courts in Oklahoma, have

12

set this as one of the prerequisites for furnishing a free case-

13

made, and we think it is significant for the reason that, by

14

implication, it indicates that for this requirement to have any

15

relevance, it must mean that if the defendant or his counsel

16

could prepare a transcript, that the court would consider it.

17

We would like to further remind the Court that part

18

of this record has already been transcribed; that three of the

19

witnesses that petitioner maintains are material, their testi­

20

mony has already been prepared in narrative form; that the only

21

testimony needed were the three witnesses who testified in be­

22

half of the city and the defendant, and we believe that this

23

could be prepared in narrative form and we think that the

24

Appellate Court below would consider it in that fashion.

25

Q

Mr. Ratcliffe, as I read the opinion of the

32

1

Court of Criminal Appeals, they didn't touch this at all.

2

A

No, sir; they did not,

3

Q

Was it argued to them?

4

A

I wasn81 in that proceeding at that time and I

5

don't know, but it did not go to that.
Q

6

Well, don't you think if there was a procedure in

7

the Court of Criminal Appeals, as you suggest, that they would

8

have mentioned it in their opinion?
A

9

Well, I would like to think that they would have,

10

but if the question was not put to them, I just don't know

11

whether they would consider it or not.
Q

12

They went on the merits and said that simply be­

13

cause this was an ordinance and not a statute, that you didn't

14

get it, period.
A

15

Yes, that inasmuch as this was a violation of a

16

municipal ordinance, that there was no statutory authority for

17

it.
Q

18
19

And if it had been a State statute, and the man

had been given 90 days, there would have been.
A

20

The State law authorizes the furnishing of case-

21

mades in those cases that are tried in the County and the Distri

22

Courts.

23

Q

So that is the only point that they decided.

24

A

Yes.

25

Q

Do you support that?

33

1

A

Yes

2

Q

Why?

3

A

Well, I believe that

4

Q

What is the magic difference between the viola­

5

tion of an ordinance — well, let me first ask:

6

the same jail?

Does he go to

7

A

No, sir.

8

Q

He goes to the City Jail.

9

A

Yes, sir.

10

Q

But he serves 90 days.

11

A

Yes, sir.

12

Q

And if he goes to the City Jail and serves 90

13

days and he is a pauper, no appeal; if he is sentenced by a

14

State statute, he goes to the State jail for 90 days, he gets a

15

record.

16

A

That is correct.

17

Q

And you say that is all right.

18

A

Well, I say in this particular case that there

19

has been no need or necessity shown that he had a reporter’s

20

stenographic copy of the record; that this was a case that was

21

tried in less than a day; that it was not a particularly compli­

22

cated case; that there were just four witnesses; that this

23

testimony could have been prepared in narrative form and sub­

24

mitted to the court.

25

Q

Would you have answered that in a brief, if they
34

r •

1

had prepared a narrative out of their mind, would you have

2

answered it?

3

A

4

approve it.

5

Q

6

Well, I think we have been given opportunity to

I mean, when the argument came up in the Court of

Criminal Appeals, would you have had a transcript to work on?

7

A

If we had ordered one? yes.

a

Q

But the other side would not.

9

A

Well, no.

10

Q

And you, don’t see anything wrong with that?

11

A

Well, I don’t know why there would be any neces­

12

sity for us to have a transcript if we could stipulate and agree

13

and approve on a narrative-form statement of the issues.

14

say, I can't cite you any cases where Oklahoma has held that

15

they would consider it in this way, but by implication, I think

16

that is there, that it could be.

As I
V >

17

Thank you, sir.

18

(Whereupon, at 10:30 a.m., the argument in the above-

19

entitled matter was concluded.}
