ARGUMENT OF JOHN

Mr. Frank.

FRANK, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4

MR. FRANK:

5

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

6

Court.

7

the decision of the 9th Circuit in this matter has exempted

8

all securities companies from regulation under the applicable

9

securities act.

10

We heard the Solicitor General express his opinion that

It is our belief and our argument to you that the Govern­

11

ment gives this case an averbreadth, that the Solicitor General

12

need not be so concerned over the extreme range which he reads in

13

an opinion.

In our view it is not truly there.

May we make perfectly clear, I have been in this case for
almost four years and presented my arguments, and we have never
suggested anything about the SEC not having regulations over
the securities companies.
The registration of an insurance company is required by
lav;, indeed, these briefs give citations of the manner in which
they are registered.

We have no doubt that the inside disclosure

laws apply to the insurance company.

We have no doubt that all

of the regulations as to the daily trading by the insurance
companies are fully applicable for that registration under the
Act of 1940, as well as 1933's act, are required.
It is our view that this is a decision
22

'

which was

i

accurately described by — let’s take the Independent Reader,

Judge Herrlands in the Southern District of New York recently

statute did not govern because it impaired a detailed

Now, let me give you briefly the account, as we see it,
of what happened and what the issue is and how it comes here.
Ir. the year 1964 an Arizona company, National Life, was
largely owned by another concern, National Securities.

The

National Securities people bought in on a second Arizona
company, Producers' Life.
Later in the year 1964, a merger proposal was made to merge
these two companies.

Now, let me say a word about the Arizona

laws to insurance company mergers.

What happens under our

statutes is that first there must be approval by the directors
of the two companies.

Then the matter is put up to shareholder

vote in each company.

Thereafter, if it is approved by the

shareholders, the matter then goes to the Director of
23-

Insurance

4 \

and he must review the legality of the proposal and specifically

2

under our code must consider it from the standpoint of general

3

legality

4

shareholders specifically, as well as the policy holders and

5

the merger becomes effective on his approval.

6

under cur lav/s and in terms of the interest of the

What happened was this:

The Directors did approve.

The

7

matter went to the National shareholders and they approved

8

without question.

9

and there was a contest and there was a minority group which

The matter went to the Producers shareholders

10

contested and there was a rip-snorting good proxy fight to

11

determine how those shareholders would vote on the question

12

of this merger.

Thereupon, the SEC, early in 1965, filed this action and
the action which was filed was filed exclusively under Section
10-B of the 1934 Act and under Rule 10-B-5, which I will be
speaking about principally.

The action at that time, I should

mention because this point may be important, the action was
brought against our clients, the people promoting the merger,
but it was also brought against the selling directors.
that that be held in mind for just a moment.

I ask

The action was

brought, but the thrust of the action as brought was that it
was to enjoin the merger and to enjoin the shareholders'
meeting and to enjoin letting the matter be presented to the
Arizona Director of Insurance.
What happened was that an ex parte order was issued of
24

1
2
3

which we had no notice which did restrain- these things and
thereupon, we filed the usual motions and the matter cams on
before Federal District Judge Mathias.

4

At that point the Court dismissed as to the selling

5

directors and the selling directors are not in the case»

6

are not in the case now in any way and there has never been an

7

appeal from the order in that respect.

8
9

They

The matter which was held was simply the question of whether
our clients could be enjoined from going forward with this

10

merger and specifically, could be enjoined from presenting the

II

matter to the shareholders whose meeting was suspended by the

12

order of the Court as to whether or not they could vote.

13

In those circumstances, the essence of the complaint as

14

made by the SEC, a3 fairly summarized in the Government0s

15

brief, was that there was objection to four elements of the

16

proxy solicitation which had been going forward in connection

17

with this merger, in connection with the shareholders' meeting.

18

There were, as X said, there had been a minority shareholders'

19

suit and you can see that the matter caraa on in a crowded

20

courtroom before Judge Mathies with the shareholders present

|
j

i

21

and the SEC present.

22

is a matter of whether this merger can go forward which

23

properly should be taken up with the Insurance Director of this !

24

State."

25

Judge Mathies said, "Wo.

I believe this

He said,"we ask that you stipulate there be a fair period
-

25“

1

of time and that you give notice to the SEC so that the SEC

2

can present to the Arizona Insurance Commissioner any facts

3

.relevant to this merger."

4

He broadly admonished that if any of the shareholders were

3

dissatisfied they should take their problems to the Arizona

6

Commissioner of Insurance.

7

At that point the matter came on before the stockholders

8

who overwhelmingly approved the proposed merger and the matter

9

went to the Commissioner of Insurance of Arizona.

At that

10

moment we served notice to the SEC that it was being presented

11

to the Director of Insurance.

12

The SEC presented to the Director of Insurance all of the

13

pleadings in this case, sent them down with the suggestion that

14

the Director of Insurance should take these things into account

15

in deciding whether to permit the merger or not.

16

Thereupon, after a reasonable period of time, the Arizona

17

Insurance Director did approve the merger.

18

Commission which had sought no stay there, had not gone to the

19

Circuit or come here, thereupon, amended its complaint, got

20

leave to amend and did amend.

21

complaint and in the light of the comments of the Solicitor

22

General, I think it perhaps would be worthy of noting that the

23

amended complaint and its operative portions are contained in tha

24

appendix <•

25

At that point the

It then presented an amended

All I wish to say is that the amended complaint asked that
*-

26»

I

the merger be nullified.

2

0

Where is that in the record?

3

A

At Page

99.

It asked that

no steps be taken toward

4

the merger while it was already done.

5

next paragraph is that the merger be nullified and set aside.

6

In the remaining paragraph there is a reference that relates

7

to the original contract of purchase, but that was of no

3

consequence because that was directed at our clients and their

9

actions and the actions of the selling directors, but the

10

That was obsolete.

The

selling directors were not parties.
The SSC moved to x'ejoin them as parties, but that motion

11
12

was denied and they never appealed it.

13

the end was steps to nullify the merger.

14

which is here is net some broad issue about the relationship of

15

the securities or insurance industry, but

16

question:

17

reverse a merger of an insurance company or insurance companies

18

on the ground of asserted misleading proxy solicitations?

The precise question

it is simply this

Does Rule 10-B-5 give the SEC power to stop or

We say the answer to that question is no and we say no on

i9

20

three

2!

the purpose.

22

What they asked for in

independent grounds, any one of which is sufficient for

We say no, first of all, on the ground that the McCarren

23

Act, in the light of the Arizona statute, bars this intervention

24

by Federal Court and by the SEC and the 9th Circuit and District

25

Court to0k that point of view.
27

1

Secondly, we say as a wholly independent ground, that the

z

whole thrust of what the SEC was seeking to do here is to

3

enjoin the merger or set it aside on the ground of some alleged

4

impropriety as the proxies.

5

Section 10, Bule XO-B-5, and Section 10, Rule 1Q-B-5 does not

6

deal with proxies.

But they bring this action under

7

Through another section that does deal with proxies, the

&

proxy rules and provisions did not pertain to this company at

9

all and more than that, Congress has expressly provided by a

W

different Act which was not mentioned yesterday, but which is

1?

discussed in the briefs, has expressly provided that insurance

12

proxy solicitations are to be subject to State control and the

id

9th Circuit in general took our position on that point.

14

Then there was a third ground which we advanced and 1 would

15

like to have that clearly in focus.

16

to the purchase and sale of securities and if, therefore, there

17

was not any purchase or sale, then there is no scope, no place

18

of operation for the rule.

IS

Rule 10-B-5 applies only

The real question in the case, therefore, at the lower

zc

court stage, was whether a so-called statutory

21

sale of securities at all and hence, whether it was within the

as

scope of this statute and this rule.

23

merger was a

As I will develop in just a moment, when Mr. Justice

24

Douglas was at the Commission and when Justice Portas was at

25

the Commission the Commission took the view that a statuafcory
-

28

*"

9 1

purchase

was not a sale and the 9th Circuit so held on the

2

basis of a recommendation of the Commission.

3

years the Commission has reversed itself and abandoned that

4

position and now seeks to extend Rule 10--B-5 to mergers.

5

So, what the 9th Circuit said

In more recent

was the most important

6

question in the case, it was whether the Circuit

7

rule its opinion in this court.

8
9

would over­

The 9th Circuit did not have to decide that, having decided
the McCarran Act question.

One question before this Court is

10

how many of these independent grounds it should

11

respectfully submit that it should consider them all.

12

Government says it should not consider the citing of an opinion

13

of Justice White which holds that where there are complex

14

factual issues which wT€:re not considered at the Circuit, then

15

the Court in its discretion may allow them to be considered

We

rather than consider them here, but the purchase and sale probie n
is not a complex factual question; it i3 a pure question of
law and there is no factual record.
The matter went over on

affidavits and I submit that this

is an independent ground for decisions which you may properly
consider.
Q

We don't reach that if wre agree with the 9th Circuit

on the McCarran Act.
A

These are truly independent.

Q

When you are urging us to consider them all?
>■

29'

It is

10 '5

z

only if we decide against yon in the McCarran Act.
A

That is right, and Your Honor, let me now address

3

myself to this proposition, such a misfortune should not

4

occur.

5

Q

6

7

You are not confessing judgment on the McCarran Act,

are you?
A

We are not.

If I thought this opinion was as broad

8

as the Solicitor General had said, I would not have said that»

9

We have not made any contention on this broad scale sort.

10

Q

May I ask you on® question?

Suppose a stockholder of

11

one of the merging companies went into a Federal Court on the

12

basis of diversify of & Federal law and brought an action for

13

injunction.

14

and fraudulent statements and representations had occurred in th

15

solicitation of the exchange of securities.

16

matter, would that ba a basis for the grant of injunctive

17

relief?

18

A

Suppose he proved that material misrepretafions

As a technical

Your Honor, it might very possibly be the basis for

19

a grant of conjunctive relief if he went in under the diversive

20

ground and not this Rule 10-B-5»

21

Q

That is what happened.

You spoke earlier bout the SEC enjoining the merger

22

but what has happened here is that the SEC has resorted to a

23

court and said that there is a violation of a provision of

24

Federal law that prohibits the use of manipulative or deceptive

23

devices in connection with the sale or exchange of a security.
30

'

1
2

3
4

Forgetting all your other points, the SSC is going in there
as a litigant and it is asserting a point of law based upon a
specific provision in the Federal act.
Now,

X take it that, your first task is to persuade us

5

that that is a regulation of the business of insurance and

G

therefore,, the McCarran Act applies; is that correct?

7

A

That is correct, Your Honor»

In other words, had this

0

been a diversity action based upon state lav;, then none of these

9

problems would be hare.

10

and it was disposed o f.

We had such a thing and did litigate it

Vi

Our problem now is whether the rule under the McCarran

12

Act can be allowed to reach a statutory merger of insurance

13

companies.

14

Q

Suppose in the consummation of this merger there had

15

been a violation of the postal laws.

16

that the McCarran Act would preclude criminal prosecution under

17

the postal laws.

18

sought here, the remedy rather than the cause of action, is

19

precluded by the McCarran Act.

20

let's take it another way, Mr. Frank, let's suppose that the

21

SEC through the Department of Justice, started a criminal

22

prosecution against the company and some of its employees for

23

fraud committed in affecting this merger.

24

that that is precluded by the McCarran Act; would you?

25

A

You are not suggesting

What you are saying is that the remedies

Your Honor, 1 would have to answer that

10

the answer is no because the State of Arizona has no direct or

11

equivalent criminal law dealing with thcit same subject.

12

reason I put it in that tentative fashion, Your Honor,is that

your question takes me by surprise and 1* would have to look back!

14

to the code criminal provisions.

Q

The

I don8t think it takes you by surprise, Mr. Frank.

18

The point I am asking you to address yourself to, because it

17

seems so inevitable in this case, you objected to the Solicitor

16

General’s argument, because you said it is too braod and you say

16

there is an area that is not foreclosed by the McCarran Act.

20

I suggest to you that perhaps that area includes c

21

criminal prosecution and Federal statute for fraud in connection

22,

with the sale of securities»

A

I

Mr. Justice, there is the case which probably is in

your mind, the case of Sylvanus from the 7th Cireut.
Q

What you are objecting to here, what you are 3aying

iSfcty/

t

i

3 1

here, as I follow your argument, may be that the McCarran Act

2

precludes the z-emedy here which the SEC seeks in the application

3

of Rule 10-B-5»

4

A

If you think I am wrong, tell me so.

We do say it is wrong because the pleadings as a

3

whole, the complaint and the amended complaint take the

6

complaint and remedy portions altogether, are solely and exclu­

7

sively directed to upsetting an Arizona insurance company merger

3

and we say that cannot be done under the McCarz'an Act,

9

you call it a cause of action or a remedy under the two of them.

10

That is because we have a very express code.

whether

Our

11

code provisions are set forth in our own brief.

12

we have on Page 49 the provision and the express language, right

13

in the heart of our insurance code, as to what is the function

14

of the Insurance Department in connection with a merger of

13

insurance companies.

16
17

18
19

20

You will see

Against this must be balanced the fact that the
McCarran Act expressly said that no Federal law will be
allowed to invalidate, impair or supercede a State law vhich
deals with the business of insurance.
I have put this question to the Government and I have

21

put it again,

22

conceive of how it would be possible more totally to supercede

23

the Arizona Code 20-731 than to sustain the position of the

24

SEC in this case because the entire matter is that they are sayi ng

25

i have put it with the upmost urgency.

I cannot

arises:

The Government in its brief, the question

Is the merger and the existence of an insurance

company to be regarded as part of the business of insurance?
The Government says on Page 17, "Historically, such matters as
the chartering

and licensing of insurance companies are matters

for the State.“
This is exactly what we are dealing with here.

The

question which was presented to the Arizona Insurance Director
was whether the marriage of these insurance companies was to be }
allowed to give birth to what is,for all practical purposes, a

j

new insurance company.
0

Doesn't Arizona also or the Commissioner or some
i

regulatory body there have some proxy rules?
A

Your Honor, may I answer that in terms of how it was

}

then and how it is now?
Q

How about now?

A

At the present time there is comprehensive regulation j
j

because, Your Honor, in 1964 Congress passed what is known as
the 1964 Amendments with which I assume you are familiar.

Those

Amendments expressly provided that the States should have proxy
control in insurance companies if they would adopt regulations
of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
The State of Arizona, like all the other 49 States,
has adopted 3uch regulations so that we now have a comprehensive
regulatory code over proxies.

They apply and the proxy rules of the Commission do

Q

That is right.

It is now clear that the proxy rules

of the Commission do not apply and that brings me to the other
aspect of the matter, Mr. Justice White.

The situation as the

Congress has expressed it in the clear language of the 1964
Act, expressly and precisely provided that the proxy rules of
the SEC should not apply to insurance companies.

3

Q

This case could never happen again?

A

That is right.

That is the whole point, Your Honor.

to

Frankly, I make bold to suggest now that this is a case in which
11
tne certiorari could be providently granted because this is the
12

13

last case in the United States where this could come up because
all the States now have regulations.

14
15
IS
17
10

But I want to make clear that we had adequate law on
the subject there because Arizona had adopted what they called
the "Little McCarran Act" earlier and we had statutes that
said:

McCarran Act" and this had many statutes applying to irregularit ies

If Arizona then had rules applying to proxies and the

had some rules applying to proxies, under the Federal law

the situation was bad and under tie State law it was good.
What then?
A

The answer is this:

This, I think is the most

fundamental single error the Government makes.

The Government

takes the position in its brief that there must have been no

Arizona law in point foecan.se it disagreed with the Commission

as to the consequences of these particular statements.

position is to the contrary.

Your decisions under the McCarrani

Act do not provide or require that the State must automatically I

I
agree with the Federal Government-.

5
Q

6

Your answer is that there is not really a conflict.

If there was a conflict between Arizona and the Federal law,

Arizona law would control?

8

!
A

The conflict was not in the law so much, but in its

9
application.
10

Q

Let us assume there was; is your position that

11
Arizona would control?
12
A

Our position would foa that the Arizona law would

i

13
control as to the weight to be given to the significance of
14
one of these proxy statements.
15
Q

I think that is part of the Government’s point here,

16
that if the securities laws are going to apply at all here they
17
certainly should be able to apply to the extent of being able
18
19

to say to enjoin the use of a proxy statement which violates
the Federal lav;.

j

A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

Even if under Arizona law that proxy statement is

That is correct.

good?
The whole point is that what your

cases have said repeatedly is that the States need not simply

-36-

:

automatically echo or ruhberstamp the Government.

In this

instance, there is a problem of whether a given financial fact

tion has to be made by somebody.

These are,none of them,great mamouth

It is a question of what weight is going

The 1964 Amendments do not apply to this case, do

No, they do not.

Q

Second, it was my understanding that these 1964 Amend­

ments which became defective in 1966 applied, were intended so
far as here relevant, to displace the Federal Act by the
appropriate State acts only with respect to the regulatory
provisions and not to displace the manipulator, anti-manipulatoj:
and anti-fraud provisions such as 10-B-5.

Po you disagree with

that?
A

Your

Honor, I simply approach it differently.

It

is our position that what was intended, if I may meet that
very squarely, what was intended at least was to determine
whether proxy solicitations would or would not be subject to
Federal or State law.

Mr. Justice, may I take a moment or two to wind up?

11

Mr. Justice Fortas, all 1 can say is that if that was the

12

Commission's point of view now it was not itfhen it presented the

13

1964 Act to Congress, because in 1964 hearings they went in and

14

said, "We need this legislation for the purpose of controlling

15

proxy solicitations in connection with mergers.” At no point

16

did they say "We already have this power in some respects” or

Now, in this case they tell us that they had it all the

I bring to your attention expressly that Congress

has repeatedly had before it the question of whether it ought

We quote a report of the Senate Judiciary Committee

When Mr. Justice Douglas and Justice Fortas were with the

Commission their position was that these provisions of law did

not apply to mergers at all.

It is our position that if this is to apply to mergers it

should, certainly not be retroactive to our company situation

It runs the snowplow straight through it.

The real question is:

Who has the power to decide whether

the two insurance companies may merge or not?

But with

special attention to the matters which Justice Fortas has raiseq,
why did the SEC tell Congress in 1964 that it needed the proxy
amendment to reach mergers if it had already had that power
and, finally, the most serious question of all under the
McCarran Act, why did Congress, relating to the colloquey with
Justice White, why did Congress expressly provide in the 1964
Act that the insurance mergers should be under State control if
it intended the insurance proxies to be under State control?
