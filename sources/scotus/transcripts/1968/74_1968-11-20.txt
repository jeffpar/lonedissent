No. 74, Philip Jerome

MR. ROGERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Justices

of the Honorable Supreme Court of the United States:
I would like to indicate at the outset for the record

10

that I would like to allocate my time in 20 minutes for argu­

11

ment and reserve ten minutes, if possible, for rebuttal.

12

like to also for the record indicate that I was assisted in and j

13

truly appreciate the help from the Solicitor, John Knotty, III,

14

of Rhode Island.

I would

17

was charged, tried and convicted, first, in the District of

19

Rhode Island and in the Federal District Court for a wilful fail

21

tary Forces of the United States.

The case, I feel, is accurately cited in the brief for

23

petitioner.

24

this case is whether or not the defendant in that case and the

25

appellant here did, in fact, have notice of the draft notice

that the petitioner had with the Selective Service System of

in fact, be in the State of Tennessee and that' the transcript

13

will indicate that that was received by the local draft board

14

on the 20th day of May 1963.

15

The matter of notice relative to receipt of the draft

16

notice has, in fact, been discussed in the case of Bartchy v.

17

The United States and I submit that this is a very important

18

case.

19

to properly advise his draft board of his address, but the case

20

indicates that he is not, in fact, required to remain in one

21

place, even if he is in fact anticipating the arrival of a draft

notice.

The case does indicate that the defendant does have a duty

I submit, further, that we are in compliance with the
so-called Bartchy Case.

This matter, if it please the Court, I

feel is of great significance because this particular appellant
has, in fact, done everything he could.

And I feel that I agree

with the case law of this country, that a person has a duty to
remain in compliance with the law.

Am I right in understanding that your defense, your

Is that the issue that you were raising, the so-called

I agree with Your Honor.

What does fitness or unfitness as an emotional matter

If it please the Court, at the tria! leve, it was a

learly straight criminal defense.

On the M■Naughton basis?

A

I filed a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity.

Q

The M1Naughton test?

A

The M'Naughton test was, in fact, applicable at that

5

time.

I requested the trial justice to give to me the charge

of the American Law Institute rule.

In effect, yes, Your Honor.

I feel that the tran­

script would, in fact, and does, in fact, bear out the position,

if it please the Court,

15

Q

Mr. Rogers, I notice you opened and said you were

16

going to give only 20 minutes.

17

issue that I must say to you in all candoii is the only one that

18

really concerns me in this case, and that is the refusal of the

19

trial judge to postpone the trial.

23

You haven't yet touched on the

Are you going to get to that?

You are here urging that the trial judge committed a

12

s

Yes, Your Honor, I will address myself to that imme­

diately.
If it please the Court, in the ordinary criminal case,

24

many things happen.

The United States Attorney had, in fact,

25

argued against me in my motion to have the then defendant, now

10

-

i

1

appellant, examined as to suitability*

2

was, in fact, examined at the United States Naval Hospital at Ne

3

port and we had between us a report that indicated clearly un­

4

suitability for service»

5

Subsequent thereto, he

1 went on the record, if it please the Court, out of

6

the presence of the jury and so advised the trial justice»

remarks of the Assistant United States Attorney, as in fact bein 3

The

The trial justice did not, in fact, recognise it as

11

14

a motion.

I concede and I agree that this
However,

I

Additionally, in that the plea of not guilty by reason

IS

of insanity had, in fact, been put in issue and the fact that the

17

United States Attorney did, in fact, indicate and clearly indi- ]

18

cated on the record that the appellant, then defendant, was in

19

fact willing to submit for induction at that particular time,

20

and I asked the Court to bear that in mind, that the transcript

21

does, in fact, indicate that from the lips of the United States

22

Attorney came the words "In that he is, in fact, unwilling to

23

report for induction, we feel no further prosecution was in

24

order."

25

Q

Is this the situation as you saw it at the time, if

11

-

-

1

the Government were to find on an examination that he was not,

2

in fact, fit for induction, his having said, !'I will go through

3

this examination.

be inducted," the Government would have dismissed this prosecution';

If they find I am fit for induction, I will

Is that it, and that you. wanted an opportunity to go

5

6

through this examination and the trial judge refused you the

7

opportunity?

Is that what it all comes down to?

8

A

No, if it please the Court.

9

Q

Let me ask you this:

I am looking at this colloquy

10

between the trial judge and Mr. Gearon, who I gather represented

n

the Government.

12

A

Yes, Your Honor.

13

Q

Mr. Gearon seiys,

"This is the position that if this

14

man submits to induction, in all probability he will not be

15

acceptable anyway.

16

to go down to induction, the Government would take the position

17

and the United States Attorney has recommended that there will

18

be no further prosecution because it would really, in effect,

19

if it were a person who could be eligible for the Armed Services

20

there would be a point in going forward with it.

21

as this person, while charged with failure to report for induc­

22

tion, which is a serious crime ..." et cetera, and then the

23

Court says, "Are you ready to go to trial or aren't you?"

24
23

But in view of the fact that he is unwilling

But insofar

Then I thought your position was, although the Govern­
ment was willing to postpone the trial and not even to go forward
-

12

-

1

with the prosecution iff in fact/ it were determined that he

2

was not fit for induction, that the trial judge didn’t give the

3

opportunity to have the examination which would dete.rmine that,

4

fact.

5
6

Is that right?
A

j|

Is that right or not?

It is not, Your Honor.

The examination had already

been accomplished at that time and the trial justice well knew
i

7

of the findings of the three Navy psychiatrists at that time,

8

if it please the Court.
This was immediately before trial.

9
?G

11

12

We went to trial

approximately two minutes later.
Q

The Court said, "I see no need of it.

Let's try this

case and get it behind us."

13

A

Yes, Your Honor.

14

Q

That is what the judge did say?

15

A

Yes, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

16

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD

17

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

10
10

MR. GRISWOLDs

May it please the Court:

20

This is a troublesome case.

They say that hindsight

21

is always 20/20 and there are at least a half a dozen points

22

where I wish it had been handled differently and might not have

23

come here.

24
25

However, in reviewing it in our office, although there
are a number of critical points, we found none where it seemed
-

13

-

i

\

to us appropriate for officials in the Executive Branch of the

2

Government to do anything, but to present the case to the Court.

3

There are several critical points. There are some
issues which I think are not serious and which I will leave to

4
5

the brief.

6

was not "insane'1 within the legal definition of that term, that

7

there is virtually no evidence that he was insane, and the jury's

8

verdict that he was not insane should not be subject to review, s
It also seems to me clear that proof that he was

9
10

It seems to me clear, for example, that the defendant

"unfit for Military Service" is irrelevant in this particular
'

11

prosecution.

12

could simple ignore --

!3

Q

Otherwise, any person who had a health impairment

Apartment, Mr. Solicitor General, from the prosecution

14

as such, I gather that a finding that he was unfit might have a

15

bearing, might it not, on the issue of whether the trial should

IQ

have been postponed?

17
18

A

The question whether the trial should be postponed is

another issue.
j

19

Q

Apartment from the merits of the prosecution itself,
I

20

the fact that he was not fit for induction may not have been

21

relevant on the issue of guilt or innocence.

22

be, might it not, relevant on the issue as to who --

23

A

But it might well

Yes, Mr. Justice, and that is one of the two issues

24

which I am picking out of the group.

25

dispose of others.

I am simply trying now to

Perhaps I didn't make it claax? enough that I
-

14

-

j

1

thought that that was a different issue than the one as to

2'

whether the trial should have been postponed.

Then there was the argument about the authority of

that is an issue.

The indictment

I don't know whether there is any difference.

I thinl

14

it is arguable that knowingly in that statute doesn't quite

15

mean perception within the mind, but means that the circumstan­

'16

ces were such that he knew he was doing wrong.

17

With respect to that, it is probably clear that he

18

did not in fact himself receive or know about the notice to

19

report for induction.

20

ment has to maintain that he knowingly failed to report for

21

induction, although he did not have actual knowledge of the

22

notice to report for induction.

23

So we do have a case in which the Govern­

There is a long history in this case going back to

24

1963 when the defendant filed a printed form in which he filled

25

out his name with the Draft Board, in which he declared his

disaffiliation from the draft system.

time a student and the Board continued his 2-S student deferment

3

He was, however, at that

In the fall of 1965 he ceased to be a student.

The

4

Board sent him on November 29, 1965, an order to report for a

5

physical examination.

6

7
3
9
10

He ignored that.

I

He did not report.

The Board, it seems to me, used a certain amount of
calm at that time.

On December 21, 1965, they sent him a second]
%i
order to report for a physical examination, on January 6, 1966,
I
and the record is clear that he received both of these notices
and that he failed to report on January 6, 1966.
|j

1\

On January 11, five days later, he was declared

12

delinquent under the regulations of the Selective Service System

13

A delinquency notice was sent to him and the record is clear

14

that he received that delinquency notice.

15

The particular notice which was sent to him v/as a

16

somewhat old form.

17

him that he was subject to criminal penalties.

18

him, as the regulations plainly say, that he would be subject to

19

immediate induction ahead of even volunteers.

20

We have examined it in the record.

It advised

It did not advises

On January 14, he v/as ordered for a third time to repos

21

for a physical examination, this to be on January 20, 1966.

22

v/as on January 17 that he sent to the local board the letter

23

which appears on page 48 of the appendix.

the whole letter.

25

It is somewhat bizarre.

"Dear Sirs:

"Your threatening letters continually arrive, tell me

That shows that he was aware that he was in a somewhat
