CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Lear, Incorporated

versus John S. Adkins.
Mr. Cohen, you may begin your argument.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER R. COHEN

5

MR. COHEN:

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

7

the court, first it is important to show in this case that Lear

S

never properly raised or preserved the question of whether

9

licensee estoppel violates either the patent laws or the anti­

10

1!

trust laws.
Although Mr. Wallace, for the government, referred

12

to pages 25 to 28 of one of Lear's reply briefs where Lear

13

had quoted the constitutional standard or convention and the

14

sections of the patent laws dealing with validity, he did not

15

read far enough from that portion of the brief.

16

In that section, after quoting those provisions

17

what Lear was arguing was only that the federal laws, including

18

the constitutional standard, had to be applied in determining

19

the question of validity.

20

that the doctrine of licensee estoppel was Invalid in that it

21

violated either the patent lav/s or the anti-trust laws.

22

That portion did not in any way assert

In fact, at page 75 of that same brief Lear had a

23

separate section dealing with the doctrine of licensee estoppel

24

in which Lear conceded that the doctrine was applicable in this

25

case unless it fell within one or two exceptions, one being
41

1

terminations the other being repudiation.

2

I have Xeroxed copies of the brief that Mr. Wallace

«C»
<->

referred to, pages 18 through 283 and I have handed them to

4

the clerk this morning for this court to consider if it so

5

desires.
In fact, the government concedes in its amicus brief

6
7

that the issue of whether or not licensee estoppel violates

8

either the patent laws or the anti-trust laws is not timely

9

raised or preserved in this case.

10

At page 8 the government

says as follows:

11

"This Court need not be deterred from reaching this

12

issue, licensee estoppel, by the fact that petitioner's inten­

‘13

tions in the state courts were directed primarily to attempting

14

to carve out an exception to the doctrine rather than to its

15

overturn."

1G

Because of this Court's decision, upholding the

17

doctrine of Automatic Radio Company versus Hazeltlne It would

18

have been futile for the petitioner to have argued broadly to

19

the state courts that federal law bars the states from applying

20

the doctrine of patent licensee estoppel.

21

22
23
24
25

Moreover Lear has conceded in the state court system
that the rule of licensee estoppel was applicable unless Lear
!

fell within one or two state exceptions.

The best statement of

this concession appears on page 109 of Lear’s answering brief in
the California District Court which is quoted at page 120 of the
42

1

appendix before this court and which states as follows:

2

r;It is a recognized principle of law that when a

3

license agreement provides a grant of a right to either manu­

4
5

facture, US6- or sell a product incorporating a patented, invention.
I
the licensee is estopped to contest the validity of the license i

6

patent only so long as the licensee is operating under the

7

license."
This is not only the modern rule but, as plaintiff

8
9

likes to call it, it is also the old rule as well.

This rule

10

was set out in the 1939 case of the Armstrong Company versus

11

Shell Company of California which was a California court opinion.'
I
Lear then goes on to say this estoppel lasts only so

n
13

long as the licensee operates under the license agreement.

14

estoppel arises not because of the express terms, but because

15

the licensee is using and enjoying the benefit and protection of

16

the right covered by the agreement, and should not be permitted

17

to reap the benefits of the agreement and at the same time con­

18

test the validity of the patents to show failure of consideration

19

for the agreement.

This

Q,

What appendix are you reading from?

A.

Appendix No. 120, volume 1.

Q

There is no question, I gather, that the state court

did rely on estoppel to dispose of this case to some extent?
A.

Yes, it did rely on it to a certain extent.

Q,

And your point is that no one ever really raised the

43

j

1

uestion whether federal law forbade the state court to rule

2

hat way.

■o

/'
v;

c*
7

A.

That is corrects it was never raised in the state

ystem whatsoever.
Q

What about the passage in the brief that was read

o us yesterday?
A.

The passage in the brief that was read to you

8

esterday was dealing primarily, in fact exclusively, with the

9

onstitutional standard and the patent laws insofar as they

10

oncern the standard for invention.

There was nothing said

11

here about licensee estoppel and particularly nothing said

12

bout whether it violates the anti-trust laws or the patent laws
That section was dealing solely with the validity

13

14

uestion and what the standard was for determining the validity

15

f a patent.

16

uoting the constitutional provision and the patent standard

17

et forth in section 101, 102, 103 and subsequent sections, they

18

onclude that this test must be applied in determining validity,

19

ut there is no statement there concerning licensee estoppel, or

20

hether those standards have to be applied in determining whether

21

he doctrine of licensee estoppel violates either the patent laws;

22

r the anti-trust laws.

23
24
25

Q,

I think this is clear from page 28 where, after

I do not exactly understand what you say they did not

aise with specificity?
A.

I am saying they did not raise with any specificity

44

1

the question of whether the doctrine of licensee estoppel per se

2

violates either policy of the anti-trust laws or the policy of

3

the patent laws.

4

court or in the appellate court.

5
6

Q

This question was never raised in the trial

Did they raise the question of what law governed,

state or federal, in the trial of the case?
I

7

A.

Not on this issue because this issue was never

8

raised.

9

applicable whether or not it was state law.

I assume it was just conceded that the doctrine was

If

it was decided, we can decide it helre.

it was decided, assuming it is essential to

narrow

12

decision.

It

13

respect.

I would assume that if it had not been properly raised,

14

it would not be properly before this Court.

15

Q,

Even if the court decided it?

16

A.

I would assume that the court had decided it as a

17

question of state law, because it was not raised as a federal

18

question, and in trying to carve out exceptions to the doctrine

19

in that Lear had claimed that it had either terminated or

20

repudiated the agreement, Lear stated that these were state

21

exceptions to the doctrine.

22

or less assumed all along the line that what was being applied

23

was a state doctrine, since it was never questioned under the

24

federal laws in any way.

25

Q

So I would gather that it was more

You say that has been a hot controversy for years,
45

1

has it not?
A.

2
«->

It has been a controversy before this Court, yes, but

it arose in this case in the context that Lear conceded the
applicability of the rule, and then contended only that they fell

into two so-called state exceptions -- that they had either

a

terminated or —

Q,

They conceded that the state law governed on that

A.

They conceded that the doctrine of licensee estoppel

point?

10

was applicable without saying any place in the state system

11

whether it was state or federal.

12

But by the fact that they

tried to use so-called state exceptions to come without the rule]

13

they probably also conceded that it was a state doctrine, although

14

I admit it was never specified which one it was.

15
16

17
18
19

Q.

You mean they conceded that point that the licensee

was barred because he had been a licensee, while breaking the
validity of the patent?

Is that in the pleadings?

Did they

do that in an answer?
A.

No, they did not do that in the pleadings.

They did

20

this in a brief on appeal and also in a brief in the trial

21

court in which they conceded the applicability of the doctrine

22
23
24
25

of licensee estoppel, and sought to bring themselves within two
exceptions of it.
Q,

They conceded the validity of it under any law?

A,

I would have to assume they did because they never
46

I

1

questioned that it was applicable.

2

Q,

Where in the record can I find it?

■Zj

A.

On page 120 of the appendix.

4

(1

Is that all?

5

A.

Yes, Volume 1.

6

Q,

That is what youread before?

7

A.

That is correct.

e

Q

9

Appendix No.l?

I read that a moment ago.

Maybe I thought I had the

wrong ones.

10

A.

It is on page 120, Your Honor.

11

Q

That would not necessarily preclude us, would it?

12

Assuming that they had not pressed the point below, that would

13

not preclude us from deciding the issue, would it?

14

about as plain an issue of law, law pure and simple, if there

15

is any such thing, that one can readily imagine.

16

A,

This is

I would assume that under procedural rules that have

17

been laid down by this court that, unless the issue is timely

18

raised as a federal question, it is too late to raise it in

19

this Court.

20

Nov; It went through the California system without any

21

question as to the applicability of the doctrine.

There was no

22

federal question presented.

23

to carve out state exceptions to this rule, on the theory that

24

they had either terminated the agreement by sending notice of

25

termination, or had repudiated the agreement, and on both those

Rather there was only an attempt

Issues Lear took the position that that was state law,, and

2

since they were applying it to the doctrine of licensee estoppel

3

[ would assume that they would also —-

4

Q

I do not want to take up your time, but certainly

5

shere were plenty of federal questions raised below, and your

6

3oint, I take it, is that assuming that this particular

7

argument was not made below, is it too late to make this

8

Dartlcular argument here?

9

k

I think it is because the only federal questions that

10

?ere raised below were in connection with the application of

11

;he federal standards for patentability which never really

12

jecame an issue in the California Supreme Court because it

13

ipplied the doctrine of licensee estoppel.

14

;an reach the issue of licensee estoppel it cannot go any

15

Further than that.

16

22

25

So unless the court

And If that is decided solely on a state

ground as a matter of state contract law, then the federal
patent issues that were raised never will arise in this case.
Q,

You said, if I understood you, that the estoppel of

;he patentee related only to part of the issues in this case; is
;hat right?
A.

Yes, that is only part of the issue.

Q

Are you going to tell us about that sometime in the

jourse of your argument?
A.

What the other issues are?

0,

Yes.
48

!
\

1

A.

The other issue is primarily the construction of the

9

contract and Lear's attempts to avoid the contract by saying

3

that it either terminated or repudiated — and therby get

•-v

itself into the federal court system in a pure suit for in­
fringement.

The California Supreme Court devoted a good part of

6

its time to determining ifhether or not Lear had terminated the

7

contract —

II

Q,

Do you agree or disagree that this contract has to

be construed and applied totally from the point of view of the
patent license contract?
A.

No, I do not think it does.

I do not think It is in

12

the pure and technical sense a patent contract.

13

patent events to a certain extent, but it is more concerned with

14

a bargain for the disclosure of an invention in return for the

15

payment of a royalty for the disclosure of that invention.
That is the real basis of that bargaining which I

16

17

It relates to

will get to as I get further into my argument.
Just as the issue relating to the licensee estoppel

18
19

is not properly before this Court, in my opinion, similarly the

20

issue of patent validity is not before this Court for several

21

reasons.

22
23
24
25

1

First, if the issue of licensee estoppel is not before
this Court, it cannot reach this dependent question.
Second, the issue of validity was not one of the
questions present in Lear’s petition for Certiorari.
49

1

2

Thirds it is not a necessarily included question
under rule 231(c).

3

Fourth, California Supreme Court did not consider the

4

issue of validity ands under settled procedural rules, this

5

3ourt will not normally pass on the question of first instance

6

without the lower court having undertaken to decide those issues.
In fact the government urges at page 26 of its amicus

1
8

crief, that if the issue of validity must be reached, that the

9

case should be remanded to the California Supreme Court for

10

consideration of this issue.
Consequently, in my view, because the doctrine of

11
12

licensee estoppel was never properly raised as a federal issue

13

and the doctrine of the validity of the patent was consequently

14

not before the court, the result should be that this petition be

15

dismissed as imp ro violently granted.

16
17

Q

What makes you think that the court below decided

the issue of estoppel based on state grounds?

18

A.

'What I think it was doing was using —

19

Q,

What makes you think that?

20

A.

Because it did so in connection with the construction

21

of an agreement, and although it used the words licensee estoppel

22

it was really using those words as a shorthand method of summing

23

up what it had already determined on the contract, namely —

24

25

Q,

It said early in the opinion that before setting out

the facts they wanted to talk about some fundamental principles.

5o

1

Among those fundamental principles was licensee estoppel.

It

3

A.

That is right.

What are the cases that are cited that Walker cites?

[>

A.

I would assume that Walker cites probably state cases

6

and federal cases as well.

7

ft

Cites a federal case?

8

A.

I would assume he does, but in those cases it may

9

well have been that what the federal court was doing was applying

10

local lav/ in a diversity based on a contract action.

11

I would not know that without reading the case —

Of course,

Let us assume, for the moment, that there are no state

applying.

to do, just assume that the state court did not know that?

Q,

Therefore it should not be a defense if

Basically you think estoppel has to be rooted in

19

A.

Correct.

20

And it is only a question of whether that state law

22

They may go too far because of an overriding federal

52

If we are confined to the narrow situation and there is

!

laws, perhaps the patent laws, but I do not see how the patent

2

laws can apply here especially in the context of this case

3

because the bargain was really net for patent or patent rights.
I will get to the essence of the bargains in a

■i

ii

minute — that Lear received a disclosure from Adkins of an

6

idea, discovery and invention for which they agreed to pay him

7

as long as they continued to use it, subject to three conditions

8

of subsequence.
Those conditions subsequent were:

9
10

1.

If no patent issued.

u

2,

If a patent issued with claims which did not

12

cover the Inventions they were using in the 2156 California

13

gyro and Michigan steel gyros.
3.

14

If the patent is held Invalid in third party

15

action, although they tied these escape hatches to what might

1G

happen under the patent laws, they were really just a way of

17

reducing Lear's liability under the agreement to continue to pay

18

up until the expiration of the patent.

19

conditions has occured, they, of course belong to the bargain.

20
21

Q,

Since none of these

$fes, but did not the license agreement just cover

patented or patentable devices?

22

A.

It did say that in paragraph 2(a), but —

23

Q,

Did it not say that before that?

24

A

No —

25

Q-

Then does not somebody, before Lear is liable have
53

1

to determine that these devices were either patented or

2

patentable?

3
4
5

A,

I think, first, you have to read paragraph 2(a) with

paragraph 1(b) in order to determine what Lear was in effect
4

Are you saying by doing that Lear may be forced to

6

pay even though it is determined that none of the devices are

7

patentable?

8
9

A.

No, I am not saying that at all.

I am saying when

you read paragraph 2(a) with paragraph 1(b) the Lear license was

to

what the invention disclosed or intended to be disclosed and by-

It

use of the words "if patentable" they were bargaining for what

12

the patent office might do, or what some third party might do

13

through the patented third party adjudication.
But they were not bargaining that they themselves

14
15

could contest the validity of the patent, and thereby avoid the

16

bargain.

17

patent does not issue, or if the claims do not cover what we are

m

making, or the third party holds it Invalid and therefore can

19

use it free, that we should also be able to use it free.

20

under those conditions only can we terminate.

In other words, they were saying, in effect, that the

2

A.

No, there is no question about that.

Q

So we are dealing in a federal domain right from the

beginning.
A.

We are not, for this reason, in my viexf.

That is,

tj

when they tied their bargain to patentability, they were tying

7

it —

Q

To a federal concept.

9

A,

To that standard, but only for one purpose.

Not to

10

control the rights viz a viz, but to let Lear out of the contract

11

in the event that a patent did not issue and somebody else could

12

therefore use it.
In other words, their bargain was - we will pay you

13
14

for this invention which we have an exclusive right to use,

15

subject to conditions subsequent, which are: if no patent issues

16

or if the claims are not substantial and do not cover the in-

17

vention or If it is held invalid with third party adjudication.

18

Only subject to those three conditions can we get out.

19

than that, our bargain is founded upon your disclosure, Mr.

20

Adkins, of the invention, and our use of the invention for

21

which we agree to pay the royalty.
So the patent laws are really not involved in this

Q

Can you give a memorandum to us on that?

We have done

a lot of cases in this field and this is the first time anybody
has stood there and had the temerity to make that suggestion.
A.

I think I have outlined the cases in my brief.

The

19

one that comes to mind in particular is this Court’s opinion

20

in the case of Brulotte versus Thys where the court was con­

21

sidering the use of a patent to exact a royalty after expiration

22

of the patent by tying it to the license of the patent, and where

23

the Court, when faced with the question of what would happen if

24

the parties had made a contract for a machine which was not

25

patented, whether or not this would involve federal law.
56

The Court there said - the sale or lease of un­

1

patented machines on long term payments based on a deferred

purchase price or on use would present wholly different con­

siderations.

This is something that

is assumed to be patented or patentable.
A,

Yes, but what I am trying to say is that when they

used the word "patented” or "patentable" in paragraph 2(a).
2(a) expressly refers to 1(b) for further definitions of the
term used, and it defines "claims'* as including the inventions
disclosed or intended to be disclosed in the specification of
the application, and that Lear is taking a license of the

So they merely used the specifications to define the

Q,

The difficulty I have with your argument is that you

seem to have a contract here that depends upon the patent law anc
the special rights flowing from patent and a. license under the

I am not really saying that.

I am saying that as

patent aspects of it are unlawful as a matter of federal lav/.

You can resort to state contract law and still collect the same

12

a federal patent.

13

So the contract unquestionably at some point related to

A

Yes, I do not deny it related to a federal patent,

14

cut the question is the way it related to that federal patent.

15

The California Supreme Court held that Lear was not

16

concerned prior to the issuance of the patent with particular

17

claims in the application.
What they were licensing was the invention either

IS

19

disclosed or intended to be disclosed in the specifications

20

without regard to the claims for which they agreed to pay until

21

final patent office action; and that, further, when final patent

22

Dffice action occured, if a patent Issued they would have to

23
24

25

continue to pay regardless of whether that patent was valid or
cot valid because that was no part of the bargain between the
parties.

59

However, if a patent did not issue, then they would

1
2

have the right to cease paying further royalties because in that

3

situation a third party would be free to use invention also.

4

Q

You mean that this contract could have included a

3

promise by Lear to use in connection with this disclosed device

6

some other device that the seller wanted Lear to use?

7
8
9
10

n

A

You mean could Lear have used it together with

something else ~~
Q,

Would the contract be valid just because it was

valid under state laws?
A.

In that situation I would assume that Adkins had no

32

control over what Lear used it for and it would not rise to a

13

level of a federal question.

34

Q,

You mean you could tie something to this —

15

A

No, I think I am saying just the opposite.

16
17

18

Adkins

could not and did not tie this *—
Q

How does it become federal law. though?

A

Because then, if you tie something in, whether the

19

contract follows a patent or not, I would assume you would get

20

involved with the anti-trust laws.

21

conspiracies to violate the anti-trust laws that do not involve

22

patents.

23

which violate the anti-trust laws irrespective of whether

24

patents are involved.

25

Q

For example, you can have

Similarly, I would assume you can have agreements

Mr. Cohen, do you see any difference if this contract

Do you see any difference in those?

You mean where they agreed In the first instance that

Q,

Yes.

The reason I mention it Is that I think there

7

is some significance if It runs past the patents and you say it

8

has nothing to do with the patent.

9

A

No, I did not say it had nothing to do with the paten

Lear to get out of the bargain if certain events occurred.

Q

13

A.

That is all?
In my view that is all.

And in the view of the

14

California Supreme Court, if I interpret their opinion

15

correctly? that is all they were involved with.

16

Q

17

A

I guess the patent was incidental.
The patent was not Incidental. It was involved to

18

the extent that Lear’s escape clause and conditions subsequent

19

were tied to what might happen in the patent office or some

20

third party ~~

21

22

(J

I assume you are getting at the job of finding out

how far patent is involved in the agreement.

23

A

That is correct.

24

Q,

If it is involved to a certain degree, then you are

25

in trouble, and we are left with the job of finding out how far
61

it is involved; is that right?

A.

I am trying to tell you in my view how far I think it
I think it is involved only to the extent that the

is involved.

4

conditions subsequent under which Lear can avoid the payment of

5

further royalties are tied to the patent laws, and no more.

6

4

I suppose if the California court was purported to

7

follow federal law you would be saying they would have come up

8

with the same result.

A.

in this area,

17

I do not see how they could be following federal law

On license estoppel, donft you think they would have

come up with the same result?
A.

1 really do not know what they would have come up

with had the question been presented as one of federal law.

Q,

You do not argue that the cases in this court

recognize license estoppel?
A,

I think they recognize licensee estoppel.

The

18

Automatic Radio versus Hazeltlne Case is probably the best

19

example of it, the most recent decision in which the doctrine of

20

estoppel per se was upheld in 1950 after first finding there was

21

no patent misuse.

The cases go all the way back to Kinsman versus

22
23
24
25

Parkhurst in 1855.
Q

So if the Supreme Court of California had been pur­

porting to follow federal law they would have come up with the

62

1

2

same result.
A,

That is what I am not so sure of, because I am not

3

sure that the cases we have been talking about, Hazeltlne,

4

Kinsman and all the other cases, that this court was not saying

3

that the doctrine of licensee estoppel has nothing wrong with it

6

as long as you do not use it to transgress the anti-trust laws

7

in some way.
I think that is what they are after, what the

8

9

Hazeltlne case makes clear.

Assuming that a patent right is

10

involved, as long as that patent right is not misused, either

It

by price fixing, by tie-ins, or by conspiracies to restrain

12

trade, then the doctrine of licensee estoppel can be applied,

13

in fact should be applied.
I would assume it is being applied to enforce the

14

15
16
'17

bargain of the parties.
Q,

Suppose California legislature had enacted a bill

which the governor had signed into law to this effect:

In this

18

state any person who signs a license agreement for a patent must

19

pay even though the patent is void and has been so held in the

20

Supreme Court of the United States?

21

22

A

I think that itfould probably interfere with their

right to contract freely with each other.

23

Q,

Do you think that would be a valid law?

24

A

No, I do not think It would.

25

Q,

Why is that not the question here?
63

1

A.

Because the parties here at the outset when they

2

made this bargain in 1955 were free to contract as they wished.

3

They could have provided in the contract —

4

Q,

They were free to contract under the other, to say

5

that you not only can contract but that it is good despite the

8

fact that it Is patent law.

7

contract.

8
9
10

11

A.

That would leave them free to

I thought that in the hypothetical that you posed

you were saying that law said that they could not contest
validity —
Q

That he should pay what he has agreed to pay, even

12

though the patent is void and it is so held under laws of the

13

United States.

14

A.

That forecloses the parties from bargaining as to

15

whether they deem the validity of the patent should be material

16

or not, so for that reason I would say that that law is probably

17

invalid.

18

had it been concerned with the question of validity, inserted a

19

clause in the agreement saying we reserve the right to contest

20

the validity of this patent if it issues.

21

Q

However, in this case in 1955, Lear could very easily,

Why should they reserve it if the federal law gives

22

It to them, and deprives him of the obligation of paying for

23

the services of a void patent?

24
25

A.

I do not think the federal law gives him that right.

Q,

That is right, so you get back to that question —

64

1

k

I do not think it gives them that right because what

2

the parties are dealing with here was not the patent lav;s and

3

the patent rights per se»

of an invention for which Lear agreed to pay.

Q

30

k

Why would any person be de­

I think he can contract to purchase a bare idea or

1?

discovery regardless of whether* it is patented or patentable.

12

This is a question of state contract law and what is consideration

13

of a contract.

14

Q.

Except when it gets into the patent field.

15

A,

That may be where this Court is trying to go3 saying

16

you must engraft upon every agreement which deals with something

17

which is capable of being patented, a provision that the parties

18

cannot make a bargain unless they condition it; first, on ob­

19

taining a patent; and, second, upon the patent being valid.
That may be where the Court wants to go, but I submit

20
21

that is a very harsh result, to take away from the parties the

22

free right to make any contract they wish with respect to an

23

idea or a discovery even if it does not arrive at the dignity

24

of something that is patentable

25

Q

under the federal patent laws,

But if you are saying they agreed to buy something
65

1

just because they wanted to buy it and agreed to pay it, you

2

have to fall back here, in your ease, and do fall back on all

J

your pleadings on a patent.

•o

A.

4

I fall back on the patent for one reason.

That is to

3

show that Lear did not come within the condition subsequent

6

that said if the patent did not issue they did net have to pay

7

further royalties.

8

the patent in this case, other than the fact that the claims

9

cover the 2156 California

That is the only extent to which we rely on

If we were to hold that this patent is void and that

10
11

the man does not have to pay it, there is no estoppel to be

12

raised with reference to it, and that is all we held, what would

13

you say would be the right in California of the party concerned

14

in this case?

15

A.

In this case I think that even if you overturn the

16

doctrine of licensee estoppel and held that the patent could be

17

invalid that that would not end Adkins’ rights under this con­

18

tract, because as interpreted by the California Supreme Court

19

the parties themselves were not concerned with the validity or

20

invalidity of the patent.

21

this a part of their bargain ™

22

Q

23

A.

And therefore since they did not make

Where did it say that, exactly that?
It appears at page 182 of appendix 1 in the footnote

24

1?.

Reading from footnote 17, California Supreme Court states,

25

"Lear states that the license extends only to validly patented
66

1

claims.

However, the provisions of the agreement setting forth

2

the scope of the license do not so state.

3

patent was adverted to in the agreement only in connection with

The validity of the

l

4

the right to terminate if the patent was subsequently held

5

invalid."

i

6

The court goes on to say at page 209 of that appendix.!

7

"the cause is based on rights emanating from a written agreement,

8

and the patent itself is referred to only for the purpose of

9

determining whether Lear used the Invention therein set forth."

10

I think that makes it pretty clear that what the

11

California court was saying was that even if the patent was

12

invalid it would not cut off Lear’s obligation to pay royalties

13

in this case, because they were not bargaining between themselves,

14

Adkins and Lear, for a conclusively valid pact.

Q,

Mr. Cohen, in that respect this contract distinguishes

it really from the ordinary sort of contract in similar cir­
cumstances, when a party has an item for which he has filed a
patent application and he makes a contract with somebody else foi
the use of that item.
It seems to me that your argument and perhaps the

21

decision of the California court, depend upon your establishing

22

a fundamental proposition which goes to the intention of the

23

parties which is that somehow, some way, this is not to be

24

looked at as an ordinary agreement with respect to an article

25

for which patent application has been filed and which is subject

j
i

1

to the federal patent lav/, but somehow, some way, this contract

2

is to be read in terms of the Intention of the parties and as

3

an agreement for the use of an invention without reference to
i

4

patentability.

5

ordinary agreement under the patent laws.
A.

6

If you look at the contract, it looks like an

There is no question about that.

It is certainly

7

couched in terms of a normal formal patent license agreement.

8

But I think you can distinguish it in this way.
Taking a typical situation first, a holder of either

9

10

an application for a patent or a patent would go to a manufacture r

11

and say If the manufacturer is using or is intending to use what

12

he thinks is covered by the application of the patent that you

13

either pay me a royalty or I will sue you for infringement of

14

this patent.
In that situation, which Is a typical situation, the

15
13

force behind the bargain Is the threat of the supposed patent

17

right.

IS

bargain to be made, assuming the desirability of either one of

19

the parties to sell.

20

is the existence or the expected existence of a patent right

21

under the federal law.

22

And that is probably the main force in causing the

But still the main force is the same.

This case did not arise that way.

It

It arose rather

23

with an agreement dated December 29, 1951 between Adkins and

24

Lear which is one page in length, and copied verbatim on page 11

25

of the appendix, in which Adkins agreed to disclose to Lear
68

1

"all Ideas and Inventions and discoveries which he might conceive

2

ofj which Lear agreed expressly would be Adkins' property, and

3

Adkins then agreed to license it to Lear for a mutually satis-

patent rights or patentability.

6

of a patent or patent right under this agreement was totally

7

irrelevant.

I
This agreement made no mention of patents,
To the contrary the existence

8

Then, pursuant to that agreement, Adkins went to work

9

for Lear and did invent something which they wanted, and when it

10

looked to Lear like it was going to be commercially successful

n

they said to themselves, "We have to do something about this first

12

agreement because under state law he will collect that reasonable!

13

royalty."

14

him over a three-year period and resulted in this license

15

agreement.

So the result was that they began negotiations with

!

16

Q

It was not too bad, was it?

17

A.

I do not think it is yet.

18

Q

Mr. Cohen, was Mr. Adkins represented by counsel in

19

that 1951 letter agreement?

20

that correct?

21

A.

That is right.

22

Q,

How about the negotiations that led up to the agree­

23
24
25

As I understood it he was not.

Is

ment as an issue here?
L

The California Supreme Court said that he

represented by counsel.

However, as I stated in the brief, he
69

1

was not in fact represented by counsel,

2

0

That is what I understood you to say in the brief.

O
o

Then I saw in the California Supreme Court’s opinion a different

4

interpretation.

I

it

5

Actually what happened there was, at the time Mr.

6

Adkins joined Lear, he did have one issued patent, and he

7

started negotiating with a lawyer with Lear with respect to

8

that issued patent, which had nothing to do with this case.

9

Thereafter, Adkins and Lear started discussing this

10

license agreement which Adkins alone negotiated with Lear, and

11

in the course of so doing they merged that other agreement with

12

this one, so that there were several parts of the same agreement.

13

But he was initially represented on another phase of it which

14

had nothing to do with this particular invention.
Q,

15

Tentatively, then, I think I get some illumination

16

there.

What you are urging upon us is that we construe the

17

patent license agreement, which Is an agreement upon which this

18

litigation has been conducted, as if it incorporated the spirit

19

and substance and motivation of the initial one-page agreement

20

which Adkins made with Lear.
That is probably what it comes down to.

21

22

A

It comes down to that, yes, together with additional

23

considerations which I think make it clear under the terms of

24

the 1951 agreement and the 1955 agreement, exactly vihat Lear

25

received.

70

1

Q

That is what I do not have.

Perhaps it is in the

2

brief.

3

recall it in the brief.

4

this agreements in what I call the license agreements that

5

enables us to disregard that it is a patent license agreement?

6

I do not want to divert your arguments but I do not

A.

What I do not have is what is there in

Basically, of all the considerations that Lear was

7

bargaining for and that Adkins was giving up, with reference

8

to the first agreement, none of which consideration had any­

9

thing to do with either the power or force behind a patent or

10

patent application or a patent or a patent right, except to the

11

extent that the conditions subsequent were tied to Lear’s ob­

12

ligation to pay royalties.

13

Q

That is the only extent that -—

That would cut pretty far, would it not, because

14

practically every patent license agreement involves a licensee

15

of know-how and

16

somewhat like this in terms of background on the patent license

1?

agreement itself.

I

suppose there are a great many involved facts

It is possible that the argument is an invitation to

IS
19

this Court to supercede some aspects of the federal patent law

20

where the parties had a relationship of employer-employee

21

during the period of invention.

22

A.

I would suggest that this is not the typical case

23

and probably would never come up again for one practical reason;

24

that most, if not all, corporations who employ an inventor make

25

him sign an agreement, in advance of his coming to work, that
71

1

whatever he invents will belong to the company.

This is the

2

atypical situation because they signed an agreement exactly to

3

the eontray.

4

ft

That is the emotional view of the case.

5

L

Perhaps it is that* but it is also the key to under­

6

standing the consideration and vice versa which flowed from

7

\dk.lns to Lear under the 1955 agreement which conceded it was

8

2ouched in terms of a formal patent license agreement.

9

If 1 may just dwell on that for another moment, I

10

*ould like to analyse, if I could, just what the considerations

11

are that Lear received under this 1955 agreement.

12

First, Lear received the exclusive, uncontested, and

13

Immediate right to use the secret idea, discovery, and invention

14

tfhich Adkins had disclosed until final patent office action,

15

fote that I say exclusive and not non-exclusive because the

16

License agreement was in fact expressly exclusive, contrary to

17

foat the Solicitor General states in his brief:

18

1.

It started out as an exclusive license.

19

2.

Lear received the cancellation of the letter

20

agreement on December 29, 1951 under which its liability to

21

Idkins was far broader than under the agreement that replaced it.

22

Jnder that agreement, pursuant to California law, particularly

23

a. case known as Desney versus Wilder, which is a California

24

Supreme Court case cited in my brief, based on that agreement

25

the court would find that there was an implied contract between
72

?

the parties for Lear to pay the mutually satisfactory royalty,

2

which it would have determined was a reasonable royalty.
Under that agreement, Lear would be bound to pay as

3
4

long as Lear used the device, without any escape hatches or

5

condition subsequent termination clauses whatsoever.
The third thing that Lear got under this agreement

6
7

was the right to cease payment of further royalties if no

8

patent Issued, or if it issued which claims which did not cover

0

the gyro issue, or if some third party held it invalid.
Fourth, and equally important, there vrere two

10
11

additional agreements signed concurrently with this license

12

agreement which are attached to Lear's answer and are in

13

appendix pages 40 to ^5, where in Lear, in addition to receiving

14

the right to use the invention disclosed in the patent applica­

15

tion, also received a release from Adkins of all other and

1G

different ideas, discoveries and inventions which he may have

17

created for Lear at the present and future as long as he worked

18

for Lear.

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

This was the consideration that Lear was concerned
about and was bargaining for.

The California Supreme Court

recognized it was not bargaining in addition for a conclusively
valid pact under which it could say that the patent was invalid
and therefore we do not have to pay.
Its sole rights were under the very carefully drawn
conditions subsequent.
73

?

I think it is also important In this case to under­

2

stand that when Adkins went to work for Lear in January 1952,

3

after signing this first letter agreements he ’went to work for

4

what the president of Lear* Inc. described as coffee and cake

S

money, which was $650.00 a month.

6

under this initial bargain was to be dependent upon his success

7

as an inventor.

8

perimenting with a bearing, a self-aligning type bearing, he

9

concluded that that approach to the problem would not work, after

Thus Adkins’ real reward

10

which he conceived of the invention which was the subject matter

11

of this case, and fully disclosed it to Lear and to its executive

12

personnel, to its technical personnel In Grand Rapids, both in

13

writing and. orally.

14

After Adkins made this disclosure, Lear, in its

15

Michigan plant in Grand Rapid32 began experimenting also with

16

a self-aligning principle which Adkins had rejected, and

experimented with this principle for roughly thirteen months,

18

at which time they were intending to put the self-aligning

19

principle into what we are now calling the Michigan steel gyros.

20

In fact, they had set up on production, ready to go

21

with the self-aligning principle in it.

22

23

24

at Michigan held with Mr. Sheppel, who is the head of that

25

section what is referred to a3 a midnight meeting and decided to

After a limited pro­

use Adkins? invention in the steel gyros as the only solution

2

to the problem at a critical time period when they had to get

3

into production with it.
The result was that betv/een 1955 and 1963 Lear

4
3

amassed sales in excess of $67,000,000. effectively eliminating !
(

6

all competition in this market.
All that we are asking here is that the Court

7

8

recognise what the California Supreme Court did. that the

9

primary consideration for the bargain had nothing to do with the

10

validity of the patent.
It was solely the right to use this valuable inventior

11
12

and the other additional considerations which I have outlined*

13

subject to Lear's rights to terminate on these conditions

14

subsequent, which were very carefully drawn to provide that

15

they would not be as broad as Lear is now urging.
The California Supreme Court found they were not as

16

17

broad.
Q

13

You are telling us that this was more analagous to

19

simple compensation for his services to the company; is that

20

right?

21

A.

That is correct.

When you deal with the entire

22

complex and the first agreement and the history of what Adkins

23

was doing and what Lear needed, then I think it puts it in the

24

context that this is his true reward for disclosing this in-

25

vention.
7c
*^

1
2
3

Q,

That was his compensation?

This proved to be of

reat worth to the company.
A.

Yes, of enormous value, and in drafting the 1955

4

greement, as the Supreme Court found* they were aware of these

5

onsiderations,

6

arious considerations which they go in reaching its conclusion

7

hat they were not bargaining for the right to say that the

Q,

The Supreme Courts in fact, outlined all these

Did you say that Mr. Adkins was not represented

A,

Yes, Your HOnor.

As I said before, the Supreme

12

ourt stated that he was, although the actual fact, and I put

13

he citation in the appendix, is that he was not represented.

14

Lear was represented not only by house counsel but

15

Iso by outside patent counsel who in fact conducted negotiations

16

ith them for three years and did not get serious in concluding

nder the first agreement under which their liability v?as far
ore broad.
Q,

Does that have any relevancy to the issue?

A,

1 think it has a relevancy to the issue because if you

ake the state contractual construction ground, then the validity
r invalidity of the patent is not a defense in this case,because
he parties were not bargaining for a valid patent.
76

They were

1

bargaining for the disclosure, and this was Adkins' compensation

2

for making this disclosure to them.

3

You must take this case in the context with the

4

history of the case to what ?iakes it unique from virtually every '

5

other patent situation.

6

pressure of the existence of an application or a patent which

7

forces the bargain.

Here the pressure was not the patent rights

8

or the patent laws.

Here the pressure was the first agreement,

9

and all the consideration that Lear had received under the first

In the normal situation it is the

10

agreement, and additionally the consideration Adkins gave up

11

under the second agreement.

I
12
13
14

Q

Do you put any reliance on the laws that should be

governed by the State of California?
A

I think in the interpretation of the contract that is

15

exactly what they meant, that in construing the contract that is

16

to be governed by the laitfs of the State of California.

17

Q,

18

A

But they did have lawyers?
Lear had lawyers, no question about that, both house

19

counsel a: 7 outside patent counsel, to advise them extensively

20

on this matter.

21

Q

22

A

Adkins did not?
Adkins did not, in negotiating this agreement, except

23

in the initial stage with respect to one other segment which is

24

not an issue , which Adkins’ lawyer drafted, and then had

25

nothing to do with the agreement thereafter, so fchat the terms
77

1

2

we are concerned with were drafted exclusively by Adkins
without counsel being represented.

3

Q,

What Is this thing used for?

4

L

It is used in a gyroscope to accurately position the

5

bearings which support the gimbal, in co-axial and parallel

6

relationship.

7

Q,

In the manufacture of what -- what basic thing?

8

A.

The basic thing is a gyroscope used in the guidance oi

9

aircraft.

10

Q

That is widely used, is it not?

n

A,

It is very widely used, yes.

The airplane has to

12

have at least two of them, one to tell direction, one to tell

13

attitude.

14

a roller, basically, which is mounted on gimbal rings, so that

15

it can move in three degrees of freedom and the accuracy of the

IS

alignment of the bearings that hold the gimbals determine the

17

accuracy of the signal which the gyro produces over a one to

Is there anything like it?

3

A,

There are other companies making gyros.

That is what I thought.

As the government states in its brief, Lear is the

They

I would like to spend a few moments, If I might, on

10
11

the question of hox? the 2156 California gyro and the Michigan

12

steel gyros are assembled and the result in structure, because I

13

think there may be some confusion in the mind of the Court after

14

yesterday * s argument.
Preliminarilys despite Mr. Wallace's statement that

15
16

there are two patents involved in this case, there are not.

17

There is only one patent application and only one patent.

18

one patent application, this one patent, contains claim No.9

'19

20

This

which covers both the 2156 California gyro and the Michigan steel
gyro as I will hereinafter explain.

21

Q

Is there in fact any difference?

22

A.

They are the same thing.

They are assembled in the

23

same way, the function is the same, the result in structure is

24

the same.

25

gyros.

There is no material difference whatsoever in these
79

1

In both gyros the assembly procedure is as follows:

2

bearing cups are placed on the end of a mandrel.

3

held on the mandrel not by screws, as Mr. Hale may have Implied,

4

but rather are held on the mandrel by the tight fit of the

5

bearing cup with respect to the mandrel.

6

The cups are

Then the bearing cups are coated with cement and the

7

two gimbal halves are placed over the mandrel holding the bearin 3y

a

cups.

9

closed down on this mandrel the bearing cups position themselves

Each gimbal half has a separate hole and when it is

to

in the hole, so that when the cement dries the bearing cups are

n

then left in the relationship which they were In on the mandrel.

12

Once the cement dries, it is taken apart, and the

13

mandrel is removed and the screws which hold the gimbal to the

14

mandrel are also removed and form no part of the Invention.

15

that the result in structure is a. structure consisting of a pair

16

of three elements which achieves a coaxial and parallel align­

17

ment without relationship to the parallelism of the end belts

IS

or the coaxial alignment to the receiving holes.

19

is an over-simplification, but that is the essence of this in­

20

vention, and that was used in both the 2156 California gyro and

21

the Michigan steel gyros in the same way.

22

So

That, I suppose

As Mr. Sheppel, to ifhom I have referred before, stated,

23

(he was the head of the steel gyro development program) the

24

assembly and finished structure are the same in both gyros and

25

the principle is the same in both gyros.

30

1

The remaining question is whether claim 9 which was

2

on a chart presented by Mr. Hale yesterday covers these gyros.

3

Lear concedes that it covers the 2156 gyro and, because there

4

are no material differences between the 2156 California gyro

3

and the Michigan steel gyros, it also covers the Michigan steel

S

gyros.
This is what the jury found, and this is also what

7

a

the California Supreme Court held, stating in fact that the

9

evidence was uncontradicted, that claim ,9 covers the Michigan

10

steel gyros.

11

Q

That point is contested by Lear, is it not?

12

A.

Yes.

13

Q,

They say that claim 9 does not cover the Michigan

14

steel gyros.

15

A.

That is correct.

18

A.

19

Q,

What do they say?

20

A.

What they are saying is that as they view the Michigan

21

steel gyros it is not covered by the claims.

22

not view the Michigan steel gyros the same way as witnesses who

23

testified on the subject, including the way their own witnesses

However, they do

have viewed it.

Adkins, Carpenter and, I believe, Curistan.

I have set forth most of that

19

If I may, I will get back for just a moment to this

20

Court's opinion in the Automatic Radio versus Hazeltlne case.

21

As I read that opinion, and assuming we are concerned with the

22

doctrine of licensee estoppel in this case, this court has held S

23

that where there is no misuse of the patent such as the court

24

found in Sola and Katzlnger as price fixing and as the court

25

found in Mgrcold as a tie-in, then the doctrine of estoppel may

82

1

be applied* In fact should be applied, and that is what we have

2

done in that case.

3

Taking it back to the foundation* I would like to

4

read one quote from this Courtfs opinion in the United States

5

versus Harvey Steel particularly applicable to the bargain of

6

these parties.
There, this Court said, "The United States was dealing

7
S

with a matter upon 'which it had all the knowledge that anyone

9

had, that it was contracting for the use of a process which,

10

however much it may now be impugned, the United States would

11

not have used when it did but for the communications of the

12

claimant and that it was contracting for the process which it

13

actually used, a process which has revolutionised the naval

54

armor of the world."
This language can be read directly on our case as to

15
16

what they were exactly contracting for.

17

Q

Was there a patent in that ease ultimately?

18

A.

Yes, there was a patent.

19

Q,

There was a patent.

20

A.

And the court found that there was both a patent and

21

a process and that principally what the government was wanting

22

to use was the process or the know-how, for the disclosure of

23

how to do It, and they entered into the contract which again

24

looked like a formal patent license agreement on that basis,

25

and the court said that where what you were after was the dis-

i

83

1

closure of the Idea it should not be a defense if the patent is

2

invalid because you have received everything you have bargained

3

for.

4

That was the United States versus Harvey Steel.
Q,

Suppose we found in this case that there is no

3

showing of patent abuse?

6

to be the doctrine that the licensee, having agreed that it will

7

not attack the validity of the patent in these circumstances,

8

suppose we reiterate that it is estopped from attacking it?

9

Does that dispose of this case?

10

A.

Suppose we reiterate what you assert

Yes, I think it would dispose of this case.

If the

11

doctrine of estoppel is affirmed,, as I see it, that Is the end

12

of the case.

13

Q

14

15
16

17

Without estoppel, there being no evidence of patent

abuse here, the doctrine of estoppel here being an agreement of
the parties which is in the contract, is It — that the validity
of the patent will not be attacked?
A.

There will not be a part of the bargain, which is not

18

the consideration they are bargaining for, one with respect to

19

the other.

20

Q,

There is no express agreement to that, is there?

21

A.

No, there is no express agreement, but the California

22
23
24
23

Supreme Court in construing the contract stated that that was
the construction that had to be placed on it.
Q

That is derived, I suppose, primarily, from the

express provision In the contract that you argue, that if upon
84

;

1

suit of a third party, the patent Is found to be invalid, and

2

certain consequences follow., I suppose you derive a negative

3

implication to that that the parties have agreed that licensee

4

may not challenge the validity of a patent.

5

A.

I think that is what they i«rere saying, yes.

It very

6

narrowly limited their rights to terminate this agreement and

7

that particular condition subsequent was designed to apply only

Q

when some third party adjudicated the patent to be invalid, in

9

which case that third party could use it.

10
11

Then Lear could, too.

That was its only escape hatch, so to speak.
Q,

It is fairly customary to specify, is it not, as I

12

recall in patent license agreements, licensee may not attack

13

the validity of the patent?

14

A,

I really cannot answer that. Your Honor.

I just do

13

not know how frequently they do, and how frequently they do not.

16

1 would assume if the licensee were concerned about it he would

17

expressly reserve the right to contest the validity and. make

18

that an express part of the bargain.

19

Q,

Is there a provision in the agreement with respect to

20

termination if the patent is held invalid?

21

provision like that at all, you could argue, I suppose, that it

22

is wholly irrelevant whether the patent is valid or invalid,

23

and that even if the patent were declare invalid this is the

24

obligation of the license, and it goes.

25

A,

If there were no

I would think the answer to that —

85

1

2

Q

If you contracted for the use of a process, you

contracted for the use of It whether it is patented or not.

3

A.

That is correct.

4

Q

But now you do have a provision in the contract.

5
3

says termination if it is held invalid —
A.

Yes, but that provision, as the California Supreme

7

Court construed it, was drawn to permit Lear, which had an

a

exclusive license, to terminate in the event that some third

3

party adjudicated it to be invalid and therefore acquired

10
11

12
13

14
15

16
17

It

right to use it free.
Q

So the licensee agreement does have some critical part

of it, depending upon the existence of the patent.

k

But to the sole extent that Lear's rights to terminate

and avoid its bargain are tied to what the patent office might
do and what some third party might do.

It did not give Lear the

right to do it.
In other words, it is tied in a limited way to what

18

might happen under patent laws, but only in a very limited way.

19

It does not form a part of the consideration.

20

condition subsequent under which Lear can get out of the bargain.

21

22
23
24
25

It forms only the

Mow assuming, for the sake of argument only, that the
doctrine of licensee estoppel has to be overturned, then the
question becomes what happens to this case thereafter.
Although Lear urges that this Court then delve into
the issues of validity of the patent and self-determine the
86

1

Issue, the government concedes that In that situation the case

2

should be remanded to the California Supreme Court which has

3

not yet considered th4 issue of validity.
It is the policy of this Court that lower courts first

4

i

5

be given the opportunity to pass on questions before this Court

6

reviews them.

7

since there are no new or novel patent Issues involved,that thisj

a

Court would be sitting and be performing a function performed

9

by the Court of Claims, for instance as that of the right of

1

10

Otherwise, In this case the result would be,

ordinary review, rather than reviewing questions of law.
Moreover, even if the patent were held invalid that

11

12

would not end the case.

S3

that would have to be considered, such as the proper cut-off

U

date for the payment of royalties, if the patent is held invalid,

S3

and on this issue the government also conceded in its amicus

16

brief that the resolution of this issue where the license is

\7

exclusive would depend upon state considerations of fairness

IS

between the parties.
Similarly, we wouJLd have in this case the right to

19
20
21

22
23

There would still be additional things

pursue the second cause of action.

The second cause of action

was an alternative cause of action which existed for the
idea, discovery and invention as an unpatented and unpatentable
i
invention.

We took the position under that second cause of

24

action that if the licensee agreement for some reason failed,

25

either because of the failure of consideration or because of
87

1

some illegality or for some other reason, that Adkins was under

2

one of these theories pleaded there entitled to recover the

3

reasonable value of what he, in fact, conveyed to Lear when he

4

disclosed what was the Idea.

S

Although it has been contended that Mr. Adkins

6

waived the second cause of action in its entirety, he did not

7

in fact do so.

8

waived the entire cause of action, but on a writ of mandate

9

proceedings the District Court appeal reversed and compelled the

The trial court had held that Mr. Adkins has

10

trial court judge to enter an amendment to the judgment stating

11

that the second cause or action had not been waived for what

12

Adkins had disclosed to Lear insofar as it related to the

13

subject matter of the patent application.

34

I believe that concludes my presentation.

That was the way

the thing went up, all the way.
Now this enables the presentation of numerous in­
correct statements, because they are just not in the record.
lot of the facts that this Court heard this morning are not in

Why do you not give us the rest of it, then?

18

That is right.

Another thing, much of the argument

today has been based upon the discussion, of the ideas, discover!

and inventions apart from patent rights.
Again, the record shows that this issue was eliminates i

22

at the outset of this action and no evidence was permitted on

that.

24

We simply were not permitted to go into this sort of thing.

25

We are talking about things that we have no record on.

Q

Is this one page agreement to which Mr. Cohen referred

No. sir. Your HOnor.

It has the same status in the

This document was never admitted, and the reason it

Nothing else is permitted."

Yes, Y'our Honor.

We were never permitted to develop

a record of any kind leading up to the consummation of this

Would you agree with me, Mr. Cohen, that we are

attached to the complaint, which is the same thing as the

document and which was admitted in the answer in the record to

that extent.

14

Q,

Submitted in the record?

15

A.

Yes, it is in the record, attached to the complaint

16

17
18

and the answer admits that the party signed this agreement.
Q,

Was it admitted as evidence or admitted for

identification only?

19

A,

It was admitted for identification only.

20

Q.

So it is not in the record here that we are

sidering.
A.

Yes, you can consider it because it was attached to

the complaint as an exhibit -Q,

That was offered but was not admitted.

A.

In California you do not have to offer something into

Q,

Once it is admitted in the answer,

It might be admissible and relevant and it might not.

4

Did the court hold that it admitted it as a relevant piece of

evidence?

6

A.

No 3 it did not, because I was trying to get to

7

another subject with it.

8

that Lear had signed this agreement and the California Supreme

9

Court in fact considered it in its opinion.

10

Q,

But in the answer It was admitted

It is on page 11 of the appendix, volume 1 and it is

11

exhibit 1 to the complaint that was filed, and, as I understand

12

it, the answer did not deny that part of the allegations of the

complaint.
A.

That is beyond question, Your HOnor, but the trial

court excluded it because license agreement, paragraph 13 of
the license agreement says, "this agreement supercedes and
cancels the agreement."
