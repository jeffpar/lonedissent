Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court.
Referring for a moment to the previous case and
Mr. Justice Stewart®s question, I would call attention to
ruling No. 17 in the Fairness Primer which deals specifically
with the question of paid sponsorship and advises the station
through recounting the ruling in a case of the Coleman Broad­
casting Company and says that it is not sufficient if yon simply
offer sponsored time.
Q

I lose track of the chronology here, the Fairness

Primer was published when?
A

The Fairness Primer was published July 1, 1964,

and not only was published in the Federal Register but it
appears in the record that it was distributed to each broad­
casting facility in the country.
Q

.And the Hargis broadcast was a little later

that year, wasn’t it?

Mow turning to Mo. 717, the Radio Television Mews

Directors Association case, in which there are a considerable

number of other respondents, a number of whom have filed

briefs, I think 1 might say at this point that 1 take a certain

satisfaction from the fact that in this case the American

7

Civil Liberties Union is on my side and also the United

8

Church of Christ has filed a brief amicus curiae which is a

very excellent brief, if the Court should find our brief too
long I would hope they would read that because it is a very
fine presentation of our position.
This case is the sequel to the one just argued but
it is quite different.

It fits in chronologically but it comes

with a very different setting.

There are no facts in this case

but there is a formal regulation which is attacked with a widely
scattering shotgun.
The Federal Communications Commission wrote its final
Red Lion letter on December 10, 1965? shortly thereafter, on
April 6, 3.966, the Commission issued a notice of proposed
rule-making, complying fully with all of the requirements of
the Administrative Procedure Act.
This indicated the Cbiranision* purpose to adopt rules
with respect to two matters, personal attacks and political
editorials.

The text of the proposed rule was set forth and

in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act comments
25
3

I

were invited and many were received.

2

took the form of arguments.

3

but nothing in the fona of evidence was presented.

4

no affidavits or depositions, nor was any testimony of witnesses

5

offered or invited at the hearing.

6

with respect to hearings on proposed rule-making.

7

The comments, however,

There were some representations
There were

That isn't the practice

More than a year later, on July 5, 1967, and in

8

that connection with respect to findings I would like to call

9

attention to Justice Brandeis in Pacific States Company against

10

White there is a lot of talk in this case to the effect, that

11

the Commission didn't make findings to supports its regulation,

12

but Justice Brandeis in that well-known case said here there is

13

added reason for applying the presumption of validity for the

14

regulation now challenged was adopted after notice of public

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

hearing as the statute required* it is contended that the order
is void because the administrative body made no special, findings
of fact but the statute did not require special findings,,
doubtless because the regulation authorized was general
legislation, not an administrative order in the nature of a
judgment, directed against an individual concern.
In 1967, the Commission formally adopted the rules
which it had proposed with only slight changes,

In doing so,

the Commission issued a statement saying that it was simply
a codification intended to clarify a portion of the obligation
under the Fairness Doctrine, which as I have indicated in the

4

i

previous case, finds its origin more than 40 years ago and has

2

been slowly developing over all of the

intervening years =

With the equal time provision in the statute going

3

4

back to 1927 as the first exemplification of it.

5

finds specific statutory recognition in the amendment which

6

Congress adopted to Section 315 in 1959, as well as in Section

7

315 itself which is the equal time provision.
Which, after all, is simply a specification of one

8
9

We think it

application of the general fairness concept which is implicit

10

in the very fact of Federal regulation of radio communications.

II

The regulation which the Commission adopted in 1967, has been

12

twice amended.

13

an exercise of care and caution by the Commission.

Both times to narroxv it.

Both times, 1 think,

On August 7, 1967, it was amended to exempt bona fide

14
15

news casts and on-the-spot coverage of bona fide news events

16

and then after review was sought in the Court of Appeals it

17

was amended again, this time to exempt bona fide news inter-

18

views and commentary or analysis in the course of bona fide

19

newscasts.

20
21

22
23
24
25

The regulation as finally amended is set out on pages
7 and 8, the very last line on page 6, but on page 7 and 8 of
the Government's brief and I think it is desirable to put its
terms before the Court by reading it.
It starts with the heading, "Personal Attacks,
Political Editorials."
5

'’When during the presentation of views on a con­

of an identified person or group, the licensee shall within, A

And then there is a note, the Fairness Doctrine is

This is the editorializing portion of the

Where a licensee in an editorial, one, endorses,

editorial, two a script or tape of the editorial, and three
an offer of a reasonable opportunity for a candidate or
spokesman of the candidate to respond over the licensee’s
facilities, provided, however, that where such editorials are
broadcast within 72 hours prior to the day of the election the
licensee shall comply with the provisions of this subsection
sufficiently far in advance of the broadcast to enable the
candidate or candidates to have a reasonable opportunity to
prepare a response and to present it in timely fashion.
Wow I think that that shows that -the Commission .great
care in formulating the regulation and making its requirements
clear to the broadcasters who are involved.
Before I leave the question of the text of the regu­
lation, I should refer to one other matter.

When the final

amendment of the regulation was issued there was also an
accompanying memorandum and this is set out at page 228 of

25
7

1

2

Volume I of the Appendix»
Both the Radio News Television, Radio Television

3

News Directors Association — I never can keep those initials

4

straight — RTNDA —, and the Columbia Broadcasting System,

5

make much in their briefs of paragraph 5 of this memorandum

6

which is set out beginning on page 232»

7

And it is repeatedly said and particularly in the

8

Columbia Broadcasting brief, that though the Commission in

9

its regulation exempted those several categories of news

10

broadcasts, bona fide news casts, bona fide news interviews

11

and on-the-spot, coverage of a bona fide news event, including

12

commentary or analysis contained in the foregoing programs,

13

that they took it all back by paragraph 5 of this memorandum»

14

And I suggest without reading paragraph 5 now, that

15

what paragraph 5 does is simply to remind the stations that

16

everything they do is subject to the Fairness Doctrine and

17

even though these items in the news programs are exempted,

13

that if overall they have done a job which is not in the public

19

interest, that is a matter which is relevant in consideration

20

with the regulation of the stations.

21

We think that the suggestion in the Columbia Broad­

22

casting brief that this takes back everything is not an

23

accurate summary of it»

24

that the news programs like everything else a broadcaster

25

All that paragraph 5 does it to say

does remains subject to the Fairness Doctrine which is inherent
8

1

in the very concept of public regulation of broadcasting and is

2

implicit in the grant of a temporary license to a broadcaster

3

on the basis of public convenience interest and necessity.

4

And so we have the rules which were adopted by the

5

Commission in 1967, with the two later modifications.,

6

anything more, the respondents here filed petitioners for review

7

of the orders of the Commission£ some of these were filed in

8

the Seventh Circuit, others in the Second, but they were all

consolidated by transfer in the Seventh Circuit and that is

Without

the one decision which is before the Court,
For a record, the parties filed the comments which
had been filed before the Commission and the orders and memo­
randa of the Commission,

There is a second volume of the

Appendix, Appendix Volume II, which counsel on the other side
assures us is a part of the record but I winder.

It is at

least an odd sort of record.
It consists of factual material not otherwise in
the record which was included

in a brief which was filed before

the Court of Appeals.
There wTas a motion for leave to file this brief as
an exhibit, and this motion was granted by a judge of the Court,
I don't suppose that makes it a part of the record.

Then there

was insistence that we include it in the record here and we did
not think it worth making an issue of it.
Whatever this material is I would point out that it

6

the Commission has included in those rules in an effort to be

7

8

9

as possible.

The Commission did
In any

And I would mention* too* that the footnotes in the

M

several briefs contain references to programs which have

12

appeared since the rules were promulgated and with no indication

13

that the rules are applicable to these or that anyone is seeking

14

to apply the rules to them.

15

The whole proceeding puzzles me.

No one has yet been

16

ordered to do anything.

17

imposed* there are no specific concrete facts before the Court.

!8

The facts just float around and this morning about five minutes

19

before the argument I was handed a transcript of a broadcast

20

of January 28* 1969* and told that it would be referred to in

21

the argument.

Q

No penalties or forfeitures have been

I haven't had a chance to read it.
Mr. Solicitor General* would it change your

23

argument at all if the Commission did think that all of these

24

broadcasts contained in that Appendix were subject to the rules?

25

A

Mr. Justice* it is perfectly plain that almost
10

1

without exception nothing in the appendix is subject to the

2

rules.
Q

perfectly plain, I guess the parties claim to the contrary?

There is some discussion, a good deal of dis­

cussion that the Sevareid broadcast would be covered by the
rule?
A

The Sevareid broadcast would not be covered by

the rule if they were included in a bona fide news program as
most of them are,
Q

I know that but otherwise if they weren’t they

would be covered, you agree with that?
A

The Sevareid interview program would be covered

and the one that was handed to me this morning is a Sevareid
interview program, but even there I would like to know what the

Commission does about it.

Do you think the volume, the burden, the extent of
the burden, is really a matter for --~

A

Why* yes, of course, Mr. Justice.

The extent of

the burden would be a matter for consideration and I think we
ought to have facts about that and I think we ought to know what
the types of programs are, what the nature of the response
required is, what the burden is of meeting it.

We have nothing

of that sort here.
The thing that gives me great concern about the way
this case has come up is that it makes this great rule, this
bona fide effort to deal with a problem that people ha%?e been
wrestling with for 40 years, it makes it subject to a parade
of horrors.

18
19

Q

Yes, but I suppose that people are- entitled to

review rule-making proceedings, aren!t they?
20
A

They are entitled to do it a good deal more than

21
they use to be entitled to.

I Laughter!

It still seems to me

Q

Well, the law provides for it, 1 suppose.

12

I

1
2

guess it doesn’t require the Court to deal* to speculate or
A

I think this is a nice example of the reason why

3

in cases of this type* and 1 repeat I think this is rather

4

different from Abbott Laboratories which is a pretty narrow

S

specific thingo

6

In cases of this type where the validity of a regu­

7

lation should not be determined with respect to any conceivable

8

facts which is in effect what is sought to be done by this and

9

by bringing in the January Sevareid broadcast but should be

10
11

determined on the basis of specific facts.
We ought not to have to consider the validity of

12

this regulation in terms of the worst that can happen but

13

rather in terms of what does happen in a particular case.

14

15
18

Q

Don’t you think it is relevant as to how the

people subject to them might understand this language?
A

Why, yes, Mr. Justice, I think it is an element

17

but even so I would like to have that developed in terms of

18

specific facts.

19

of this Sort shouldn’t be simply stricken down as the Seventh

20

Circuit did without any specific facts and simply because the

21

fears that can be aroused by a parade of the most difficult

22

cases makes it apparent that there are serious problems here.

23
24
25

At the very least it seems to me, that a rule

This is an area in which thoughtful people have been
groping for answers for nearly 40 years, with some slow but
steady growth and development over that period.
13

j

1

First, it was very general the Fairness Doctrine»

2

Then it was spelled out in more detail in the Fairness Primer,

3

which is involved in the Red Lion case.

4

has thought it wise to put it into a formal rule,, not because

3

it is cracking the whip but because that is good administration.

6

Now the Commission

That is the way to let the broadcasters know just

7

what the Commission understands their responsibilities to be.

8

And I repeat they have responsibilities which they do not always

9

seem to recognize in their briefs»
It may be that experience and concrete cases will

10
11

show that the rule needs to be modified in this detail or that.

12

The lines have been narrowed but the Commission is still active

13

and alert.

14

the rule with care and with skill based on its experience and

15

with its devotion to the public interest.

It will watch the situation and will administer

If in some particular case the Commission reaches a

16

17

conclusion that goes too far, there will always be opportunity

18

for judicial review, of that case based on those facts, and

19

with the Commission's specific ruling on those facts, before

20

the Court.

21

This is not our petition for review.

We do not seek

22

a declaratory judgment that this rule is good no matter what.

23

But equally we do not think that it should be held bad no

24

matter what.

25

Without any specific facts, and without any ruling

14

1

or interpretation of the rule by the Commission, based on

2

those facts.
Q

3

May I ask you if your argument boils down to

4

the fact that you think the rules should not be judged as to

5

its validity on its face?

6

A

Sb^ild. not be judged as to its validity?

1

Q

Validity on its face»

8

A

Yes, I think that is true, Mr. Justice.

9
10
11
12

13
14
15

that this is peculiarly the kind of a rule and a situation
where it obviously is not careless or thoughtless or arbitrary,
it is obviously been carefully formulated and where its
validity should be determined in terms of what actually happens
under it, rather than in terms of what somebody might suppose
could happen taking the worse possible circumstances which
come up.
Q

16
17
18
19

22
23
24
25

But, I suppose the most fundamental argument on

the other side is that this is really promotes self-censorship,
just the very words and breadth of the rule will cause
licensees to resort just to a bland diet.
A

20
21

I think

Well, that is the nature of the issue and if that

were the way the rule operated it would certainly be a serious
matter.

Our position is just to the contrary that what the

rule does i& to promote the opportunity of the public to hear
all sides and to have a vigorous robust debate which they will
not have if the station can put out personal attacks and then
15

1

shut up and say no you can’t do anything about it whether you

2

pay or not*

3

Q

4

I take it the Commission has expressed the

judgment that you have just stated?

5

A

Yes, Mr* Justice.

6

Q

And in its experience or in its judgment this

7

kind of a rule will not prevent stations in the first place

3

from putting out or from discussing controversial issues?
A

9

That has been the experience under the Fairness

10

Doctrine*

It has been the experience under the Fairness Primer

11

with only a minor number of problems*

12

really have any experience under the rules because among other

13

things ——

I can’t say that we

14

Q

At least that was the Commission's prediction?

15

A

That was the Commission's prediction, hope and

16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

expectation and I think that experience over a long

period

shows at least, the major broadcasters are energetic, debate
and discussion is a part of what helps them in the competition
situation, and I find it difficult to think that, this rule
should not have a chance to shov/ that it can promote public
discussion and understanding, merely because in some special
circumstances it is thought that it may present some problems*
This is not the first time that the broadcasting
industry has raised great threats*

I have referred already

to the brief filed by the Office of Communication of the United
Church of Christ and in the appendix to that brief there is
16

1

set out the introduction to a pamphlet which was put out by

2

the Columbia Broadcasting System at the time the chain broad­

3

casting rules were before the Court and they then put in the

4
5
6
7
8

strongest terms that if the chain broadcasting rules were
adopted the public would lose all the benefits of radio and so
on, and it is perfectly plain that since those rules were
adopted and approved by this Court that the industry and the
public have both benefited greatly from them.
Q

2
10

specifically about the editorialising?
A

11
12

Yes, if I have time when I get through the

rest, that is certainly a part of our argument.
There has never been a case like this before the

13
14

Mr. Solicitor General, are you going to talk

Court.

j
I

There are other cases and both sides can find some use- i

ful quotations in the other cases all of which, however, are
15

concerned with a problem somewhat different from that, involved
16
here.
17
We get considerable comfort from portions of this
18
Court's decisions in Nelson Brothers, University of Georgia,
19

Pottsville Broadcasting and particularly National Broadcasting
20
Company against the United States and these are set out on
21

pages 42 and 44 of our brief.
22

10

Now I would like to point out and I think this is of
great importance here.
The regulation involved in this case is entirely

11

neutral with respect to the content of speech.

exactly the same way and requires exactly the same action from

13

the broadcaster regardless of what views are expressed in the

14

broadcast giving the right to the reply.

A

A particular television station has a limited

e

same as the limit of F-M radio stations.

9

A-M radio stations

10

and cable television and so on the television stations are not

11

as clearly to be distinguished as they used to be.

12

The Government does not by this regulation support

13

any point of view except, of course, the central idea of the

14

First Amendment that there should be an opportunity for all

17
18
19

20
21
22
23

24
25

points of view to be heard.

An important corollary of these regulations is that
they strongly reduce the incentive for the Government to
select its broadcast licensees in ways that might be difficult
to detect on the basis of the political or other-views that
they are likely to express or favor in their broadcasting.
This, too, serves the policies of the First Amendment,
An analogy may be found in arguments in this Court.
It has been my observation that when one counsel speaks there
is always an opportunity for one to speak

on the other side.

And exactly the same amount of time made available.
22

And if
I

as happened in this case, counsel seek to have the case taken

off the summary docket and put on the regular docket so that

3

they may have an hour on a side then an hour is given to the

4

other side.

5

This might be regarded as an inhibition upon his

6

asking for additional time for himself,

7

comparable to that complained of by our opponent in these cases

8

except that it is the Court's time rather than the broadcaster's

9

time which is being consumed.

10

An inhibition quite

But the inhibition is obviously justified on the

11

basis of consideration of fairness and of values reflected in

As I contended in the argument in the Red Lion case,
our opponents in these cases seek to put us in opposition to
the First Amendment and we do not accept that position.

I

suggest that on analysis it is the Government and the Federal
Communications Commission which are the real champions of the
First Amendment here.
The Commission's regulations serve to foster important
First Amendment values which our opponents would have the
Court sacrifice in the guise of upholding the narrow and
financially motivated claim to unfettered control of air waves
that had been licensed to their custody.
This argument is I submit fully supported by this

1

Court's recent decision in the Citizens Publishing Company case,,

2

decided on March 10th, the Court there quoted from the

3

Associated Press opinion in explaining the beneficial effects

4

of free speech in the application of anti-trust laws to the

5

communications media and I was quite struck when this case

6

came down with the closeness of the application of that quo­

7

tation utilised by this Court only three weeks ago.

©

9

It would be strange, indeed, if the grave concern for
freedom of the press which prompted adoption of the First

1©

Amendment should be read as a command that the Government was

1?

without power to protect that freedom.

12

fgr from providing an argument against application of the

53

Sherman Act, and here s would simply read it, the personal

14

attack rules, here provides powerful reasons to the contrary.

15

The First Amendment

That amendment rests on the assumption that the

16

widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and

17

antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public

18

that a free press is a condition of a free society.

19

is more of the quotation, much of which is relevant.

20

And there

This view is also supported by the venerated con­

21

curring opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Whitney against

22

California which emphasises the great reliance upon the value

23
24
25

of counter argument that is implicit in our protection of
free speech in the first place.
The realities of the broadcasting industry have led

24

1

the Federal Communications Commission entirely properly in

2

view to take the steps needed in these regulations to make the

3

opportunities for counter argument a reality in this important

4

communications media.

5

owt

In the Associated Press case, the applicability of

6

the anti-trust laws to the news services and its members in no

1

way depended on the content of their news stories.

8

also true in the Citizens Publishing Case this term to which

9

I have just referred.

10

This was

The restraints of trade in those cases would have

11

been equally unlawful if all the editorials and news stories

12

being published had taken the other point of view.

13

in those cases upheld the Government’s right to regulate these

14

news media in the interest of legitimate anti-trust objectives

15

in a context in which the regulation was entirely neutral

16

with respecto the content of what was being published.

newspapers and broadcasters.

While the application of the anti-trust

In this case, another communications media is being

23

regulated in pursuit of an equally valid Government objective

24

and again in a way that does not favor or disfavor any

particular content of speech, and which doesnot forbid the
25

1

I

?
2

saying of anything.
The policies of the First. Amendment not only favor

3

access to the media of perveyors of all points of view, but the

4

Court has specifically recognised a First Amendment right in

5

the recipient or listener not to have the channels of communi­

6

cation to him stacked so as to favor or disfavor a particular

7

point of view.

8
S
10

This was established in the case of Lament against
the Postmaster General, cited at page 75 of our brief in which
I am inclined to think, on reflection in preparing this argument
is perhaps one of the most important cases which lead in

12

13

support of our position here.
It is true that the Court has stricken down regula­

14

tions in some cases which were superficially neutral.

15

example, the complete banning of

16

such as sound trucks or hand bills tend to discriminate against

17

those espousing unpopular ideas and who do not have easy access

18

to the commercial communications media.

19

For

methods of communication

Similarly, requirements of associational disclosure

20

tend to bring about burdens on those associated with groups

21

that are unpopular in the community, and thus to discourage

22

association with such groups.

j

.

23
24
25

Much the same can be said about Tally against
California where the Court upheld a right to anonymity in the
dissemination of political literature.
26

There is also an

3

important element of this in the New York Times against

2

Sullivan line of cases.

.3

to indicate that the plaintiff and his views are held in high

A

esteem in the community and the contrary about the defendant

3

while it is difficult for a truly unpopular plaintiff to win

6

much of a libel verdict against a popular defendant.

Because a large libel verdict tends

7

Yet the main office of the courts under the First

8

Amendment is to protect the right to express views that are

8

not already popular and accepted in the community and I suggest

10

that that is the fundamental basis behind New York Times

11

against Sullivan.

12

Now we come to the editorializing aspect of the rules

13

which is discussed on pages 78 to 82 of our brief.

14

I am a little puzzled because some of the principal briefs

15

filed, in the case are filed by the networks and the networks

16

do not editorialize.

Here again

facts, nothing to indicate that they do or they do not.

20

in essence the editorializing rules are much the same as the

21

personal attack rules, they call for opportunity to reply and

22

they are an exemplification of the Fairness Doctrine.

General Cox.

6

20

I

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
At the outset of my argument there are three
semantic differences, perhaps I could add a fourth now, between
the point of view expressed by the Solicitor General and the
point of view that we submit to the Court.
The first is that this case involves the personal
31

1

attack and political editorial rules that does not involve a

2

general attack on the Fairness Doctrine»
The rules are very precise.

3

They provide that if a

4

broadcaster expresses a particular kind of idea, if he criti­

5

cises a public official in a way that may be regarded as an

6

attack upon his honesty, character, integrity, or like personal

7

qualities, whatever that may mean, then certain obligations

8

attach to it and we submit to the Court and I will try to show

9

in more detail in my argument that those obligations attach to

10

the expression of a particular idea or kind of idea, one that

11

constitutionally protected, are much more onerous than

52

obligations imposed by the Fairness Doctrine.

any

And 1 may say that this is true of those kinds of

13
54

programs that are characterized as exempt under the regulation.

15

That the Commission has a special brand of the Fairness Doctrine

16

and one that the Solicitor General in the statement the

17

Solicitor General would have read if he had troubled to read

18

paragraph 5 to the Court, said unlike the Fairness Doctrine in

19

general there are special obligations where there is something

20

that can be characterized as a person attack even in a news

21

program»
The second semantic difference goes to our reading

22
23
24
25

of history.

In fact the other two go to our reading of

history.
We agree that there are certain expressions of
i

32

i

regulation of the content of broadcast to be found in the

2

Cononission5 s administration of the Communications Act but I

3

think when you come to read those carefully you

4

that they are based upon a view of the First Amendment 9 s

5

application to the broadcasting which is simply out of keeping

6

with modern interpretation in the constitutional doctrine of

7

the First Amendment and out of keeping with the current facts.

8
9

The best example is the Mayflower rule which pro­
hibited a broadcast journalist from taking an editorial

10

position on anything,

11

sustained by this Court today.

A position which surely would not be

Indeed Judge Bazelon recently observed in the Court
of Appeals of the District of Columbia that it may very well
be that some venerable FCC policies cannot withstand consti­
tutional scrutiny in the light of contemporary understanding
of the First Amendment and rathe modern proliferation of
broadcasting —- but the third theme which I would mention now
simply to draw to the Court's attention and I shall develop it
at more length later is that although the Congress and this
Court have, of course, sustained certain regulation of broad­
casting and although Congress has spoken in the broad terms
of public interest that the Solicitor General emphasizes, both
Congress and this Court have been very careful to distinguish
between regulation that has to do with avoiding interference,
securing competent licencees, dealing with the structure of
33

1

the industry as in the chain broadcasting cases on the one

2

side and regulation that lays whole of what is said on the

3

other side»

4

j
That is not always a clear line but I would emphasize

I
a

S
6
7
8
9
10

ii
12

13
14
15
16

17

that in the history both sides of the line come through and
not just the side mentioned by the Solicitor General.
The clearest expression is by Congress itself for
it declared in Section 326 nothing in this act shall be under­
stood or construed to give the Commission the power of
censorship and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated
by the Commission which shall interfere with the right of
free speech by broadcast communication.
Q

When did that appear in the first act?

A

I -—

Q

When was that first in the act?

A

I am not sure whether that was in the Radio

Act of 1927.

It certainly came in in the Communications

Act of 1934.

This Court in the Saunders Brothers case noted

18

the licensing power on the one hand but said that on the other
19
20

hand the Commission was given no control over the programs.
\
And I would mention now, too, although I shall

21

elaborate it and give you the language later, that Congress
22
on three occasions, the Congress on two and the President on
23

one occasion, rejected in the legislative process attempts to
24

put broadcasters subject to the duties essentially the same
25
34

1

kind of duties that the Commission now seeks to impose in

2

these regulations.

3

My other semantic difference with the Solicitor

4

General is one mentioned by Mr, Justice White and that is that

5

nothing has come to better settled than that regulation of

6

speech are to be judged on their face* by their tendency and

7

that the Court will not require the nation to wait until a

8

test case arises before it examines and if they are unconsti­

9

tutional strikes down such regulation.

10
11
12

13
14

15
16
17
18

That proposition is so well settled that I don't stop
to develop it,
Q

That still leaves the question though of what

the — even if you examine them on their face -—A

We must, of course, go ahead and do so and show

what tha tendency will be and I propose to do that.
Q

And under what circumstances or from what

evidence you conclude ——
A

Well, I think we can show the Court that the

19

tendency is bound to be highly restrictive especially in-

20

terms of self-censorship it is a burden that I, at least in a

21

formal sense, have to go forward and carry.

22
23
24
25

Q

And you have to overturn the FCC in that respect,

too, don't you?
A

I would think this was a question on which the

Court would make up its own mind.
35
I

1

Q

Well? I would think so, too.

2

A

There was no presumption in favor of the FCC

3

ruling.

We have to persuade the Court to reach a different

4

conclusion but I think there is no presumption in its favor.

5

Now we submit that these regulations are invalid upon two

8

primary grounds.
First; we say that they unconstitutionally abridge

7
0

the freedom of speech of the press guaranteed by the First

9

Amendment and second that they are invalid because they are

10

beyond the statutory authority of the Communications Commission„
I shall deal with the constitutional issue first;

11
12

even though the Court may never reach it, because it can and 1

13

am inclined to think should decide the case on the statutory

14

ground but I deal with .it first because the seriousness of the

15

constitutional question is in our judgment an important element

16

in resolving the issue of statutory interpretation.
Our constitutional argument, proceeds in a series of

17

IS
19

propositions, the early ones of which seem to me not seriously
controversial.
But first, we say this case involves freedom of the

20
21

22
23
24
25

press.

The electronic media are not simply carriers as they

have evolved in this country and that may be one difference
between what President Hoover was thinking of in 1924 and the
situation as it exists today.
Broadcast activities in the field of public affairs
36

1

are virtually indistinguishable from those of newspapers»

2

They have editors, producers,, reporters, their own news

3

services which add to the news services of DPI and the AP.

4

Their functions, I submit, make them one of the very instru­

5

ments which this court characterised in Mills and Alabama

6

as agencies which the fraraers of our Constitution thoughtfully

7

and deliberately selected to improve our society and keep it

8

free»
Second, I would point out that the challenged regu­

9
10

lations lay hold of speech itself.

11

distinguishes every other case involving broadcasting that has

12

come before this Court because they all had to do with the

13

economic regulation of the industry.
We are not talking about fair labor standards or

14

15
16
17
18
IS
20

21
22
23
24
25

This is a fact which

labor relations or the anti-trust laws here.

We are talking

about a regulation which says as I indicated earlier, that if
you express ideas for certain character, ideas which can be
described as an attack on somebody8s integrity or honesty or
other personal qualities, or if you put someone on the air
who may engage in those attacks, then you run the risk of
having to carry certain obligations which are onerous, but if
you steer clear of those ideas, if you prefer blandness to
biting criticism of the shabbier self-seeking, then you are
safe.

You don’t have to worry and we think that this is

fairly characterized as a regulation of speech itself.

37

Not only that, but, of course, the speech that this

1
2

regulation lays hold of is the kind of speech which this Court

3

characterized in the New York Times case, as lying at the very

4

center of the constitutionally protected area of free

S

expression,,
By its own terms, this regulation applies only when

6
7

one is discussing questions of public importance„

The speech

8

in the Red Lion case was certainly within the New York Times

9

case.

And this is true uxader all the other Commission rulings

10

under the Fairness Doctrine or the personal attack rule which

11

deal with criticisms of public officials for the most part

12

or people engaged in controversy upon public issues.

13
14
15

IS
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

My third proposition is that the challenged regu­
lations abridge the freedom of speech in ways which unless
justified violate the

First Amendment.

Inhibition as well as prohibition of protected
i

expression is forbidden by the First Amendment.

That is

perfectly clear from cases like Talley in California, Thomas
and Collins, Lament and Postmaster General.
Here the Commission, as I said before, says you may
not criticize in a way that we would call a personal attack
unless you are prepared to scrutinise what has gone out of
over the air and see whether it contains any personal attacks,
to give notice and a transcript to offer free time for reply,
and then engage in the negotiations necessary to arrange the
38

J

1

reply, disrupting your other program clearing time on a

z

nationwide hookup, if that is necessary.
Now, we submit that attaching these burdens inhibits

3
4

the broadcast criticism and political editorial in four ways.

S

I am going to state them and then 1 am going to turn to some

6
7
8
9
10

concreta examples in an effort to show exactly how they would
work.
First, attaching this condition deprives the broad­
caster of his freedom of journalistic judgment.

Even the most

fair-minded manager of a radio or television station will think
/

11

12

twice about offering criticism of this kind if the price he
must pay is surrendering his judgment as to what is in the
public interest.

13
14

Q

I take it you think it is critical for your

case to establish this effect on the content of the program in
15
16

the first place?
A

Well, we think that it is an essential part of

17
these regulations if I understand your Honor that they let

18
hold of the content of the program.
19
Q

I understand that.

I understand that, but 1

20
think it is critical if it didn't affect the consent of the
21
program because it affected them but if it didn't really

22
change, have the effect of changing the content of the program,
23
would you still be making a ----24
A

There would still be burdens that we were made

25

39

1

to carry»

2
3

Q

Exactly^ but would they violate the First

A

I think it would.

Amendment?

4

But I don’t think I need

5

stand on that because I think the problem of self-censorship

6

is very real.

7

York Times case, that the New York Times would have paid that

8

judgment rather than suppress the advertisement that was

3

bought, that there would still have been held to be a violation

to

of free speech but we do stress and we think that it is fairly

11

clear this will have an effect on the content but I would

12

assert that I can stand on both grounds.
Again, remember that the time taken to complying

I suppose that had it been a fact in the New

with this Government order is necessarily tak^n from the time
that the broadcaster might think and

might reasonably think

and even rightly think it was more in the public interest in
which it was more in the public interest to broadcast something
e Ise.
Next, 1 would emphasise that there are very con­
siderable administrative burdens and troubles to which these
regulations put the broadcaster.

He must scrutinize his

scripts and see whether they contain personal attacks, consult
with lawyers, probably more lawyers, in order to find out what
duties arise out of a particular program.
There is the sending out of the notice and the tape
40

1

which isn't a big thing for a large outfit but this regulation

1

applies to little stations, too»

3

clearing time for reply which may vary from no problem at all

4

to a really very troublesome and serious problem, including

5

an effect on the good will of the audience»

6

There is the matter of

And then there is the matter of negotiating the

7

reply and finally the matter of often defending one1s self before

The financial cost of giving the risk that you must
give time whenever you put a free swinging controversialist
on the air is not inconsiderable and most of all there is the
pressure for self-censorship which these things create»
Now I would like to take a few concrete illustrations
to show how as we see the regulations are bound to work.

Let

me call your attention first to a broadcast of Eric Sevareid's
which appears beginning on page 15 and runs over to page 18
of the record in the second volume, the one that the Solicitor
General objects to»
We offer these simply as examples of how these regu­
lations would work out»

I could make up examples but it is

more persuasive to use real ones and that is the reason we
bring them into court,
Mr, Eric Sevareid gave what I think you would agree
was an impartial and fair presentation of Henry Luce!s

41

contributions to

American journalism»

said -- it is on the bottom of page 16.

which often meant straining truth.

all have always read it.

Toward the end he

Now I suppose that that is an attack
The Time editors.

And it raises a

cpestion about their intellectual integrity and if it were
directed at me I would think that was an attack upon my personal
character.
At the time Eric Sevareid said this

he was not

subject to any inhibitions but considering today if he were
confronted with the same situation preparing his evening
broadcast at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, what does he do?
this a personal attack?

Is

Or isn't it?

Well, he might answer that it is.

Then he subjects

every station that carried his program to all these burdens.
Should he do that or should he trim his sales a bit or maybe
he doesn't know so does he call up his lawyer?
The result all too often is likely to be that
Mr. Sevareid will decide v^ell I had better not say what I think.
I had better find something that is a little safer, a little
more bland, or he may and, of course, this is of great concern, |
he may decide to transfer it to a medium where he would not
be subject to this kind of inhibition.

Q

Mr, Solicitor General, would it bother you —

z

you have just stated an instance which is an illustration of

3

why you object to the rule. Now would you, would it bother you

4

any to get to that rule where it is printed and tell us the

5

part of it which puts on the burden that you say is censorship?

The next to the last

page of the brief.
Q

This, I think, will be the core of your argument

against the rules?

15

A

It is certainly a very important part.

16

(a)

When, during the presentation of views on a

17

controversial issue of public importance, an attack is made

18

upon the honesty, character, integrity or like personal

19

qualities of an identified person or group, the — it would

20

seem to me that the editors of a magazine are an identified

2!

group and that saying that they strain truth and that many

22

reporters have always distrusted them, attacks, because attack

23
24
25

means only adversely criticized their integrity or like
personal qualities, whatever that may mean.

I don9t see how

-- I would have thought this was clearly a personal attack but
43

1

its enough for my purposes to suggest that it raises terribly

2

serious questions and that because he couldn't be sure Eric

3

Sevareid would then be put under pressure to trim.

4

Q

Except that it wasn't made during the presen-

5

tation of views on a controversial issue of public importance.

6

It was made on the occasion of the death of Henry Luce.

7

is nothing controversial about that.

There

10

national magazines, and its reliability was an issue of public

11

importance.

12

distinction.

I would be amazed if the Commission drew this
But let me ---

13

Q

Is that

all of it now?

14

A

That is

all of this instance, Mr. Justice.

15

There are many —-

16

Q

What I mean is the core of your objection.

17

A

That is

IS

the core of what I have to say with

respect to this Sevareid broadcast.

19

Q

20

Now let us assume that is the core of all of them

21

22
23
24
25

May I ask you one other question.,-

practically — that the Board, the Commission has seen fit to
provide that when a public attack attacking an individual's
integrity, integrity of a group has been allowed to take place
over the television, is it your argument that it i3 beyond
the power of Congress or of its acting subsidiary you might
44

1

say, the Commission,, to provide any kind of protection such

z

as this for the man?
A

3

We say that this regulation is beyond the power

4

of Congress and further, that Congress hasn’t authorised the

5

Commission to issue it, yes„

6

Q

That is the real basis of this argument?

7

A

Yes.

8

Q

So that there would be no relief that the man

9
10

Both parties X would emphasize.

could get from the radio station that permitted him to be
personally attacked his integrity or character?
A

11

Well,

I wouldn’t want to say that no one could

12

think of any other kind of remedy and, of course, if the attack

13

were not the kind of criticism that is privileged under the

14

New York Times case, if it were wilfully false, then we would

15

have an entirely different situation.
But this applies when it is true and a fortiorari —

16
17

when it is just the result in the state, when every word is

18

true.

Let me give another illustration.

IS

Q

How should he get that to the public?

20

A

How what?

Q

How could the man attacked have any chance to

21

22
23
24
25

get any statement to the public that it is false or that it
is not true?
A

Well he has access, if he is a public figure

and this is an issue, he has access to a number of media and
45

1

frequently he will have had an opportunity to present his

2

views on these questions, in all kinds of ways.

3

occasions.
Q

A
5

And on many

And in your example I suppose it is perfectly

obvious how the editor of Time Magazine?
A

6

Yes, yes, but I would emphasize that nearly

7

all of these, I would emphasize, Mr. Justice, I don't mean to

8

rush over what you say, I agree with you completely but I

9

would emphasize that in nearly all of these cases, the other

10

person has ample opportunity to present his views and may have

11

presented them but the Commission automatically comes along

12

and applies this requirement.
Now let me take a somewhat different aspect of the

13
14
15
16
17

matter.

end, the page that is numbered 55, is this transcript of an
appearance of Adam Clayton Powerll on "Face The Nation," a
panel show like Meet The Press.
It begins at 55 and I see no very troublesome

18
19
20
21

passage although there are some that might be thought trouble­
some until page 59 when Mr. Powell says that "...anyone
that has an estranged wife is automatically inherited a liar."
I would suppose that was a person attack upon his

22
23
24
25

In the second half of this document, quite toward the

wife,

and Mr. Powell was certainly discussing questions of

public importance at the time of this appearance.
Q

What page?
46

1

A

It is hard to identify because — yes, the

2

thinner one, towards the end, and I am on page 59.

3

farther along in the second volume.

4

two 598s printed unfortunately.

5

[Laughter]

The second 59.

6

A

I am very sorry.

7

Q

Well, there are two networks?

8

[Laughter]

9

A

There are

I am pointing out that the first personal attack

10

is on Mr. Powell3s wife.

11

reporters questioning Mr. Powell says "But does that answer the

14

15
16
17
18
19

20
2!
22
23
24
25

Now over on page 53, 63, one of the

question whether you advocate what — it is italicized — Rap
Brown and Stokely Carmichael have been advocating, guerrillatype warfare in the cities of our country?"
That would seem to be a personal attack by Mr. Dean
on Stokely Carmichael and Rap Brown.

Now, of course, both Rap

Brown and Stokely Carmichael have ample access to the press,
both indeed had been on CBS shews.

I don't think there is any

question of fairness in getting their views before the public
but nevertheless under these regulations there would be a very
real question whether CBS did not have to go through all
this machinery of giving them time for reply.
Over on page 66, toward the bottom you will see a
reference to Representative Conyers of Detroit, who was
referred to as a black Judas.

I would think that that was
47

i

calling a man a Communist is a person attack as the Commission

2

said in its opinion on this matter, calling one a black Judas

3

would seem to me to be a personal attack»
Over on page 67 Mr. Powell says that Calude Pepper

4

5

was one of the No. 1 racists on Manny Caller's committee

6

against him.

7

This again I should suppose though 1 can't say

wrfch any assurance because the Government persists in ignoring

8

these questions, I should suppose was a personal attack.

9

If it is a personal attack as the Commissioner

10

ruled to say the John Burch Society attempted through a front

11

organization to have a standard reference book removed from

12

the library in Visalia, California, then I would suppose this

13

kind of thing was rather clearly a personal attack.
And then there is a reference to Judge Matthew Levy

14
15

for issuing an indecent, obscene, illegal, unilateral order.

16

I would think that that, too, might well be a person attack.
Now the point I am trying to make, is that after this

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

program which was a free live discussion, the work would begin
of going through it and going over these things, of such questtions as Justice Stewart raised as to whether it really was a
personal attack or in many instances might have to be taken
into account and maybe decided that it wasn't, Mr. Justice.
I agree.
But the thing is that nobody knows for sure and some
of my colleagues think there are many more personal attacks
48

1

but there would be at least six or eight of them in that

2

single Face The Nation program and all those instances in

3

which the obligation would fall upon the network and all CBS

4

stations to carry out the duty of upsetting its programming;,

5

substituting offers of free time for reply and the replies,

6

in the place of what matters in its editorial judgment it

thought were more importanto

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

10

General Cox, you may

MR. COX:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
In using concrete illustrations before the luncheon
recess, the point aht I was trying to make was that these

11

regulations, have, I think, an obvious tendency to induce a
12

broadcaster and remember, we are dealing with local programs
13

as well as the nationwide programs that I used as illustrations,
14

to press a broadcaster to prefer the bland pundit to the biting
15
critic of the shabby or self-seeking, to avoid putting on
16

programs like Face The Nation, or their local equivalent,
17

round-up of reporters on a radio show, free swinging contro­
18

versialist and to use as moderators people who would steer the
19

discussion away from the criticism of Government officials and
20

other public figures rather than tortsnd we think that a
21

regulation which has that kind of impact on the actual conduct
22
of broadcast journalist, both because of the burdens and even
23

more because of the pressure toward self-censorship is a
24

violation of the First Amendment unless it is justified by
25

50

1
2

some overriding public interest»
Q

General, would you mind telling us how far you

3

think the Commission can go in determining whether there has been

4

fairness or not by rules?

5

A

Well, we would draw a sharp distinction, and I

6

intend to elaborate this a little later, between the Fairness

7

Doctrine itself and the personal attack and political editorial

regulation,

I am going to explain in just a moment, it comes a
little better a step farther on, the differences in our posi­
tion on this,
Q

Yes,

A

Because to be quite candid,

I am speaking for a number c£ parties here.

Mr, ChiefJustice,
They take somewhat

different positions and they have asked me to state their
respective positions on that question as carefully as I can
and I can do it better just one step farther along the line.
Q

All right,

A

As I was saying, we come to

justification.

on your own time,
the question of

The justification advanced by the Government

in its brief is that restrictions upon the normal liberty of
the press, normal freedom of expression here, are necessary

22
in broadcasting because in order to assure the public access
23

to what the Government defines as a fair or balanced presen­
24

tation, in oral argument the Solicitor General added as
25
51

1

further justification that the Government owns the air waves

£

and what it gives is a privilege..

3

The addition of those labels or concepts it seems to

4

me don't really advance the argument where the Government gives

S

a privilege such as the second class mail privilege, it still

6

has a duty to administer it in ways that don't inhibit expression

7

or inhibit the press, one couldn't use the second class mail

8

privilege as a way of discouraging magazines from criticizing

9

public officials or other public figures.

22
23
24

As Justice Brennan said in the Lament case, if the
Government wishes to withdraw subsidy or privilege it must do
so by means and on terms which do not endanger First Amendment
rights and I come back here to the question --Q

What if the Government gave a franchise, for

.instance# to a private party, would the Government say let us
make sure you give everybody access to the mails?
Or just because somebody was operating a communi­
cations mechanism could he say I am going to send in the mails
what I want to and that is the end of it?
A

I make two points, Mr. Justice.

First, and this is one I tried to emphasize earlier
in my argument, that broadcasters are not merely carriers.
Broadcasters as the industry has grown up, and as they are
treated by the Communications Act, are themselves journalists
and they have views to express and I would think it very

25

questionable ——

52

1
2

Q

Well, could the Communications Commission make

them, I mean could the Congress make them •—-

A

question in this case,

I think that would raise a very different

You don’t think this is even a step along the

way of making them carriers?

carriers.

9

context.

Well, I think first they haven't competed as
I would emphasize that we deal with the case in this

Second, I come back to another point that I attach

10

great importance to and that is that this isn’t like say

11

taking two hours of time, which must be given in the morning

12

to a certain kind of programs that would be established in

13

some way.
This

14

says that the amount of time we take from you

15

depends on what you say in conducting your own journalistic

16

functions.

17

lov/er field so many days a week for public purpose.

18

we will take it a day for every time you criticize the

19

Government or any other public figure.

20
21

22
23
24
25

It is not like saying we will take the use of your
It says

•'

This is attached to the expression of particular
ideas and I think that distinguishes completely the cases of
whether the Government could take two hours a day and say that
this shall be available for certain kinds of public interest
programs which will be prescribed in some nondiscriminatory
and constitutional way.
53

I really don't think that case need bother us here

1
2

because of the length between the two.
Q

3

You don't object to the Fairness Doctrine

4

generally which tells the broadcaster that if you are going to

5

talk about controversial issues overall you must
A

6

7

if I have given the impression that is my position.
Now let me come, because 1 think the argument about

8
9

No, no, I am afraid I have mislead your Honors,

public ownership really falls out and we are back to the

10

constitutional problem.

11

this justification, we are trying to provide the public with a

12

fair and balanced opinion, is sufficient.
Now there are two answers to the argument, the desire

13
14
15

to provide fairness and balance.

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

In the case of the press

is a justification for those regulations.
One, attacks the adequacy of the alleged justifi­

1©

17

And there is a question of whether

cation.

This an argument which is advanced in its strongest

form by the National Broadcasting Company.

The National

Broadcasting Company says the imposition by an arm of Government
of its standard of fairness on the press, and the enforcement
of that obligation by Governmentally imposed sanctions is
contrary to the Constitutional guarantee of freedom of the
press.
This is an argument which might be put a little less
absolutely and indeed in ray brief I have put much the same
54

t

argument a little less absolutely.

2

argument, too, emphasises the peculiarly restrictive character
of the challenged regulation and it asserts that even if we
suppose that there is a justification for Government regulation
of the Fairness of broadcasting, in order to assure the
public access to a diversity of opinion, still these regu­
lations with their peculiarly restrictive character cannot be
sustained because they impose much heavier and more burdensome
restrictions than are necessary, Mr» Chief Justice, to secure
fairness and, therefore, they fall under the feast restrictive

The Fairness Doctrine looks

Second, the Fairness Doctrine left discretion to the
broadcaster in deciding what views deserve presentation and
it holds him only to a reasonable judgment.

The personal

attack rules apply an automatic rule and they leave the
broadcaster no room for judgment in determining what is a
personal attack and when he must give reply although they do
give him the benefit of acting in good faith with respect to
imposing any fine for having failed to give notice.

If so, who may most

But the personal attack rule is

You must give time, adequate time, you

of reasonableness and good faith, the vagueness of the term
and character, honesty or other personal qualities, personal

increase the pressures toward self-censorship because if you

2

are wrong these consequences all fall in, and the pressure is

3

to steer clear of the dividing line.

4

Now I think perhaps a very good illustration,

5

Mr. Chief Justice --

6

Q

Well, General, before you get to that, I was

7

just wondering if it couldn't be said that there is a greater

8

inhibition on free speech where a station is permitted to go

9

along for three years for the length, of its franchise, to say

10

what it wants, do what it wants, and then at the end of the

11

three years risk the loss of the franchise because in the

12

opinion of the Federal Communications Commission it had not

13

been fair with people throughout because that would actually

14

be perhaps a censorship because of what they thought and how

15

they acted in connection with their First Amendment rights

16

where in the specific instance, all they would have to do

17

would be to grant the equal time and. they would be free of that

18

obligation.

19

A

/

That is true, but the granting the

equal time

20

I suggest, and the determining whether equal time must be

21

granted and the arranging to give it, are far more burdensome

22

than simply saying grant the equal time suggests.

23
24
25

And xt is the elements of discretion in the Fairness
i;

Doctrine, and simply the requirement that you act in good
faith, and being left judgment as to how you present the
59

II

opposing points of view, which give that a flexibility and

2

make it much easier to comply with.

3

Let me take as an illustration if I may the handling

4

of a program that appeared on January 27, January 28, an

5

interview which would be in the nonexernpt category, between

A

This Hoeffer is a controversial character.

he speaks in a controversial manner.

And

Following this program,

in order to comply with the notion of fairness, CBS a week
later had four columnists comment on Hoeffer and his program.
Gave each I would judge two or three minutes.
One of them called him a garrulous old wall frat and
went on to criticise him.

Another was ---

Q

This is Eric Hoeffer?

A

Yes,

Q

Not James Hoffa?

And Eric Sevareid was interviewing him,

sentative of CORE, Roy Innis, who said that he was a racist

4

but he was an honest man and he would like the opportunity to

So there were a variety of appraisals of Hoeffar.

6
7

Now that would seem to me to cover the notion of fairness.

8

But under this regulation, one would after the tape was made

9

of if it were a live broadcast* it wasn't it was taped, if it

10

were a live broadcast you would have to go over the whole

And Hoeffer said,

I would think one would have to mark that up as a

personal, attack on Senator McCarthy time for reply.
Then comes a rather interesting and puzzling one

If it is

Well, General? what happens in the rules if the

So if we live up to the personal attack rule we

have to give them time for reply.
Now? in this instance? I go on? it gets on a little
farther with nothing that would seem to me to be seriously
questionable but somewhat later Eric Sevareid said? do you

you as something important?

to deal with.

You would have a harder case?

I would have a harder case.

Now I should say just one thing more.

Well, I can’t tell you whether I would be asked

to make the argument in another case.
[Laughter]

10

Q

But would you think the same argument would be

13

A

That case would be distinguishable and I would

14

then have to argue —-

15

Q

Even though unsound?

16

A

I would have a much harder time.

11
12

sound?

I would then

17

have to argue whether th New York Times case excludes a

18

private remedy for what use to be a tort in the form of a

19

right of reply as distinguished from one of damages and that

20
21

22
23
24
25

would be a much harder case than I have here.
X don’t think I would be ashamed to argue that New
York Times should be extended in that situation.
I do want to say just a word about the supposedly
exempt categories of cases.
Of course, in news documentary, like the Klu Klux
64

1

Klan illustration in our exhibit, or the Eric Sevareid

2

broadcast that I referred to and I commend to you his broadcast

3

on the death of Jack Ruby which was certainly a matter of

4

public importance — as another illustration.
Those today would be what the Commission calls

5

6

exempt.

But look what the Commission says on page 232 of

7

the fat record,

8

Q

Exempt because they are part of a news program?

9

A

Because they are part of a news program.

Of

10

course, it is an incredible distinction because it makes Eric

11

Sevareid exempttion depend on whether he broadcasts within a

12

certain :time limits or outside those limits.

13

It makes the Face the Nation exempt because it comes

14

Sunday afternoon but if you had a special program on Wednesday

15

morning or Wednesday evening it is not exempt.

1©

understanding why those mechanical things should make so much

17

difference.

It passes my

18

But the Commission itself said in paragraph 5 on

19

page 232 that the Fairness Doctrine is applicable to these

20

exempt categories.

21

he stresses the considerable discretion the licensee has, but

22

says in the case of the personal attack there is not the same

23
24
25

Then skipping a few lines to after the —

latitude as there is in other examples of the Fairness Doctrine j
and over on the top of page 233, "Thus, our revision.,»"
requires that fairness be met either by the licensee's action

65

1

action of fairly presenting the contrasting viewpoint on the

2

attack issue? in other words, in the caseef the Powell

3

broadcast, you must run around and get Congressman Conyers,

4

Congressman Pepper, his wife and Judge Levey and the others

5

and read what they have to say or otherwise state what their

6

position is or else you must allow that particular group the

7

person, the opportunity to respond.
So really this is not really very much different.

8
9
10

11
12

The sum total difference in the case of the Powell broadcast
is that instead of having to offer the time to the particular
individual, you may present what they have to say on the issue
that Powell raised by the attacks.
I think that the Seventh Circuit was quite right in

13
14

saying that that is an illusory exemption.
Now might I take just a minute to address myself to

15

16
17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

the point which though I have slighted it by misjudging my
time, we do regard as being of very great importance and that
is the point that these regulations are not authorized by the
statute.
There are three things which 1 would particularly
emphasize to the Court.

First, while the statute uses the

broad language public interest convenience and necessity, those
words must be read in the light of Section 326 which speaks
in a statutory way of the broadcaster's freedom of speech and
limitation on the Commission.
66

1

tod also in the light of the fact that not once, not

2

twice, but three times the legislative process rejected

3

proposals to put broadcasters under duties which really can®fc

4

be distinguished from the duties that the Commission has now

5

sought to put them under„

I

6

The proposal in 1927 at one time was that there

7

should be an allowance of equal treatment for the discussion of

8

any question affecting the public and the Senate cut that down

9

to equal time for political candidates.

10

In 1933, the Senate passed and the House passed a

11

requirement requiring that those speaking in support of or in

12

opposition to any candidate for public office or in the

13

presentation of views on public questions, be given equal time.

14

And that was killed by veto and failed to become law.

15

16
17

That is really indistinguishable from the political
editorial regulation.
And then in 1933, when the Communications Act was

18

before Congress, there was a proposal to broaden Section 315

19

to allow equal time on any public question to be-voted on in

20

any election or by a Government agency and that was killed.

21

And the point that we make is that in this area which

22

does trespass on journalistic freedom, freedom of speech and

23

the press, that a Commission should not be found entitled in

24

the very general words of this legislation to impose this kind

25

of restriction until and quoting Justice Roberts in Cantwell
67
I

1

and Connecticut the policy making body has given the real

2

central issue careful and purposeful consideration and all we

3

know about what Congress did is that it rejected essentially

4

similar proposals.

5

Q
7

8
9
10
1!

12
13
14

15
16

The last point I would make is with reference to the
consideration of the Fairness Doctrine in 1959.

At that time

as the Government’s brief points out, the Congress amended
Section 315, the equal time provision for political candidates,
so as to exempt certain kinds of news programs, at the same
time it said nothing in the exemption shall have the effect of
freeing any broadcaster from the duty of fairness.
And it is argued that this was a ratification of
the Fairness Doctrine but I

—

Might I just take two minutes to finish this line
of thought?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;
MR. COX;

You may.

Thank you, sir.

17

We don't have to resolve that question here.

Because

18
19

in explaining the Fairness Doctrine to the Congressional
committees, at that very time, the representatives of the

20

Commission emphasized two limitations that these regulations
21

|

override and ignore this gradual increase in censorship that
22
brings us here.
23

One of them was the explanation that the broadcaster
24

has full and complete authority subject only to later review
25

68
i

I

1

of his whole operation»

As I say that was stressed to the

2

Congressional committees that consider this subject»

3

And the second statement was that when it comes to

4

the application of the overall fairness standard, a licensee

5

can exercise discretion as to which viewpoints are entitled to

6

be expressed and which spokesmen are entitled to be heard

7

with the exception of qualified candidates for public office»

8
9

Now neither of those remains the case under the
challenged regulation and we think, therefore, that this certain] y

10

doesn't meet the test of the most explicit statutory authori­

11

zation and that there certainly has been no careful and

12

purposeful consideration of this kind of abridgement of the

13

freedom of the press by the policy making body and consequently

14

we think under even if this question of statutory interpreta­

15

tion were otherwise fairly balanced, as maybe it is, the cases

16

like Greene and McElroy, United States and Rebel and others

17

of this kind and the policy of requiring the legislative body

18

to face up to these questions before the Court has to decide

No, but it is the type of thing where you bring

Yes, I think that is the --

Q

Would you distinguish between those two situa­

tions for the purpose of your argument?
The personal attack rule does require the

12

13
14
15
16

particular person attacked to have an opportunity.
Q

That is right.

I understand you to say that

that is wholly acceptable constitutionally and under the
statute but now what if the rule were that if you make a
personal attack or you put out a political editorial, you must

17
go out and ascertain what the other side of the story is and
18
then you yourself present it.
19
What if that were the rule?
20
A

Well,, there is something close to that in this

21

paragraph 5 but it is not what was said before.

At the top

22
of page 233 of the record — "Thus* our revision affords the
23
licensee considerable leeway in these news-type programs but
24
it still requires that fairness be met, either by the licensee's
23
73

1

action or fairly presenting the contrasting viewpoint on the

2

attack issue"1 — which he can do in any way he wants to but

3

he must be fair — "or by notifying and allowing the person

4

or group attacked a reasonable opportunity to respond."

S

Q

Again ——

6

A

The latter is an alternative one of two ways

1

he can do it.
Q

3
9

Well, again I ask you what if the licensee were

required himself to broadcast information of a certain kind?

10

A

Well, I think that is a harder question.

11

Q

Mr. Cox said he would have a tougher case.

12

A

He is, we come close to it under the Fairness

13

Doctrine.

14

fairness through some other spokesman I think he is under some

15

obligation to provide the fairness himself.
But I find it and I shrink somewhat

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

He is required to be fair and if he doesn't provide

obviously this

is a subtle and slippery case all the way through and I shrink
from being caught in a place where I say that he must say
something„
Q

Well, your inference, your real escape hatch

on that I take it is that he has an alternative.

He has

the alternative of calling in the people themselves or giving
them the opportunity themselves.
A

That is certainly one of the escape hatches.

Or

at least there is nothing in the regulation now which requires
74

1

2

that action.
Q

In any circumstance, in any specific circum­

3

stance the licensee is never required himself to draft and

4

broadcast information of a certain kind?

5

A

He is never so required and he is never required

6

to broadcast a Government release which is prepared for him.

7

There is no requirement as to the specific speech.

8

Q

Mr. Solicitor General, it seems to me like the

9

argument perhaps for the past three-quarters of an hour has

10

been devoted to an attack on the rules as ambiguous and not

11

because of lack of authority of power of the Board to issue

12

some kind of rule.

13
14
15

What do you say about that?

That seems to me to be

an attack on the language of these rules.
A

At one time we were told that the rules are

16

vague and we don8t know how to comply with them and another

17

time we are told they are arbitrary, there is only one thing

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

you can do, you must have the person attacked in to respond.
The Commission has said that the rule Will not be
used as a basis for sanctions against those licensees who in
good faith seek to comply with the personal attack principle
and in a case decided within the past year, arising under the
rules, the Commission said that there was no question of
imposing a forfeiture in the circumstances of this case where
the station has made a good faith judgment and its action do
75

1

not reflect the flagrant clear-cut case of violation for which

2

we stated we would consider imposition of a forfeiture.

3

Incidentally, the Commission has also stated in a

4

case decided within the past fax# months, that the Commission’s

5

experience over the years of operation in this area, that there

6

has been no indication of inhibition of robust debate by our

7

fairness policies.

8

Indeed, such debate has been increasing not declining^

S

during the last seven years x*he.n the personal attack principle

10

was being developed and brought specifically to the notice of

11

all licensees.

t

12

That is the Storer Broadcasting case.

13

And I would like to close simply with a reference to

14

the anti-deformation league case which is cited in the brief

15

and to which reference was made by Mr. Cox, that is the case

13

where a station broadcast anti-Semitic material, the fact was

17

that on complaint the station offered the anti-Semitic League

18

an opportunity to comply and they declined that opportunity.

19

They said we don’t want to reply, we want your license

20

revoked and the proceeding was heard before the Commission

21

and the Commission determined that on overall balance they

22

had given an opportunity for response and by other things they

23

had done they had complied with the fairness rule and that was

24

sustained by the Court of Appeals and this Court denied

25

certiorari just recently.
76

1

Q

2

Do you think that the issues here are sufficiently

1 want to ask you one other question»

3

precise, sufficiently clear, that we can pass on whether or not

4

we should pass on whether or not the Board does have power to

5

issue some kind of regulation in the nature of this one in a

6

case of a personal attack.

7

A

Are the issues that sharply drawn?

I think, Mr, Justice, you can pass on the

8

question whether the Commission has power to issue some kind

9

of a regulation,

1 would think it would be very unfortunate

JO

for the Court to hold in this case, on this record, that the

1?

Commission has no such power.

32

I can well understand the Court’s holding that we

13

don't think this necessarily is the last word and that as

14

cases come up we may need to consider it.

15

with respect to unfair labor practice which I think is no more

16

vague than the statement in this personal attack rule.

17

We have a parallel

Unfair labor practice occasionally impinges in the

18

area of freedom of speech and the fact that what a person

19

says may be an unfair labor practice undoubtedly -has some

20

inhibitory effect but the way that has been worked out is

21

through the years cases come up in which particular facts

22

appeared, and somebody said something under certain circum­

23

stances the Court decided whether or not it was an unfair labor

24

practice and it seems to me that that is what ought to be done

25

here, that it ought to be left for the working out of the
77

\

i

minds through the process of gradual adjudication and which

2

it will be determined, whether under certain circumstances

3

certain

4

action of the Commission in response thereto was an appropriate

5

action under those circumstances.

statements were personal attacks and whether the
