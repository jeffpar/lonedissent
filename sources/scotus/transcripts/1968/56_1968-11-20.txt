ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. RUSSELL KALE, ESQ.

OH BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

11

MR. HALE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

court, we are assembling a few exhibits that we expect to
demonstrate to the court at a later point during the argument.
Tills case is here on writ of certiorari to the

12

Supreme Court of the state of California.

13

the case is concerned with a patent license agreement between

14

petitioner Lear and respondent Adkins and the validity and

15

enforcement under this agreement of patent rights, a patent

15

which ultimately was issued to respondent.

In simplest form,

17

The Supreme Court of California has upheld this

18

license agreement to the practical effect that the patent

'19

is immune from challenge of validity and also to the practical

20

effect that established Federal criteria need not govern the

21

determination of the scope of the patent when it is enforced

22

under the agreement in question.

23

What we are asking this court is to rule that the

24

patent law3 and the protection afforded by them cannot be so

25

extended by private agreement between individual parties.
3

1

We are asking that this court rule that patent rights cannot

2

be so extended under state law so as to render the validity

3

and interpretation of the scope of the patent immune to the

4

criteria of the Federal patent laws»

5
6

Q

Does the so-called Michigan device really

involve a question under the patent law?

7

A

Yes, your Honor®

0

Q

As distinguished from the California device„ I

9

ID

think I have got it straightened out®

The Michigan device up

to the time of notice of termination was not patented, was it?

n

A

No, your Honor.

12

Q

Was it patented up through the stipulated time

13

u

for the cutoff on damages for purposes of this litigation?
A

No, your Honor.

There was one patent.

15

directed to the device that has been identified as the

16

California model 2156 gyro.

17

Q

It was

That was the so-called California patent.

1 am

18

talking only about Michigan which was a large sum of money.

19

I don't want to anticipate your argument.

20

answer me now, but as you go along, I trust you will.

21

brought it up at this time because of the nature of your

22

opening statement but it has bothered me since I first studied

23

this case whether and the extent to which this is truly a

24

question involving patent laws of the United States or whether,

25

at least so far as the Michigan patent is concerned, it is a
4

Don't bother to
I

I

contract question perhaps under antitrust laws generally»

2

don’t want to interfere with your planned argument but that

o
<2>

is a basic problem in ray mind in this case.

4

A

tr

Yes,, sir.

Well, your Honor, that really

highlights the Federal issues that are before this court in

6

that there was one patent and it disclosed essentially the

7

structure of the California model 2156 gyro.

©

The Michigan structure was independently developed

9

at a different facility.

In view of the procedures that were

10

used in assembling the California gyros, the Michigan gyros

n

were originally included as coming within the scope of the

12

I

. patent application and hence the agreement.

So an

13

interpretation of the scope of the patent application is

14

very basic to this question that is before the court.

15

Likewise, whether or not Lear has the right to

16

challenge the validity of this patent raised very basic

17

Federal issues before this court.
i

18

The California Supreme Court based its decision

19

solely tinder the terms of the license agreement that was

20

entered into between the parties in 1955 and the California

21

Supreme Court felt that we are not concerned with defenses

22

which might be available to Lear in determining questions of

23

validity and infringement.

24
25

The California Supreme Court apparently felt that
the agreement was supreme, it need not be concerned with the
5

■

I

1

details of Federal law that control patent matters.

*>

even went so far as to say valid claims are not required.

<'-s<

The court

We submit that the parties should, that it is

3
4

against public policy for parties to collaborate and exploit

5

patent rights regardless of validity.
Under the circumstances of this case, if Lear and

6

7

Adkins had so desired, they could have joined forces and paid

Q

no attention to whether or not the patent W33 valid or not

9

but enforced it by sheer economic power and the public

10

interest certainly would not be served toy such arrangement.
The California court also went so far as to say,

11

"It

»2

doesn't matter how this patent was obtained through the

13

patent office.

14

are concerned about.

13

added

16

for example."

17

with whether or not fraud was practiced on the patent office."

in

We don't care whether new matter was

violation of Federal rules, decisions of this court,
The California court said,

"We are not concerned

We submit that those raised very basic Federal issues,

18

19

If the patent was ever issued, that is all we

your Honor.
Such a decision results in extension of patent

20
21

rights far beyond the rights that would be available in

22

an infringement action.

23

to employ standards in patent matters that differ from state

24

to state.

25

It also permits individual states

For example, as matters stand today, the law in
6

'i

California concerning licensee estoppel is exactly contra to

2

the law in the State of Minnesota as stated by the Minnesota

3

Supreme Court in 1954 in the case of Crew versus Flanagan

4

which is cited in our briefs.

5

The ultimate result of the decision of the

6

California Supreme Court is the enforcement of a patent which

"?

the trial court in California found to be invalid as a matter

8

of law for failure to meet the constitutional standard

9

required for patentability.

10

We submit that an agreement basing a decision solely

11

upon an agreement whereby patent rights are so extended is

12

against public policy, against the policy and provisions of

13

both the patent laws and anti-trust laws.

14

If an agreement can be employed to circumvent the

15

constitutional standard required for patentability, uniform

16

Federal standards cannot be maintained in the fifty states.

17

This is a striking example of one state that is out of step

18

with some other states.

i

19

The most significant dates and events that are

20

involved in this case are set forth in the chart that I have

21

behind the lectern and I will refer to those dates during my

22

argument.

23

,
The Adkins patent application in the subject

24

matter in suit was filed February 1954.

25

entered into in September 1955.

7

The agreement was

It is the first document in

I

e

appendix two of the record which we reproduced.

2

and obligations of the parties under this agreement are based

3

on the claims as set forth in the patent application which was

4

filed by Adkins in 1954.

5

The rights

Only to the extent that the claims are patentable#

6

the agreement is very explicit in this regard.

7

pay royalties on its products that employed the invention

8

that is defined by the claims that are patentable.

9

to the repeated assertions of Adkins that the agreement was

Lear agreed to

Contrary

10

based upon secret ideas# discoveries and unpatentable things#

11

the California Supreme Court expressly based its decision on

1?«

Adkins' patent rights under this agreement.

13
14

15

For example# in appendix one at page 192# the
California Supreme Court saids
"The agreement clearly sets forth that royalties

16

are to be paid only for patented or patentable claims which

17

Lear utilised in its products,”

18

Although the agreement and the patent application

19

covers several devices and features# only the feature of

20

bearing alignment# supporting bearing in alignment for

21

rotatable device is involved in this action.

22

The technical subject matter is almost identical

23

with that which was before this court many years ego in

24

Singer versus Cramer which is cited in our briefs. The patent

25

application and the patent which ultimately issued are also
S

I
2

reproduced in appendix two at pages 18 and 32.
The circumstances under which this dispute arose

W

n

was that Adkins was employed toy Lear in 1951 under an agreement

4

which permitted him to retain title to certain inventions.

5

This was covered toy a preliminary agreement which was never

6

admitted into evidence because it was superseded end cancelled

7

by the 1955 agreement which is item number 2 on my chart.

8

Lear had two facilities at that tin®*

One was in

9

California and the other one was in Michigan and Adkins did

10

his 'work in the California facility and he developed;, along

11

with other Lear employees, this model 2156 gyro.

At the same

Michigan gyro and in 1955 Lear started manufacturing and
selling tooth of these devices and they are both employed in
military equipment, almost exclusively in military equipment.
When the license agreement was consummated, the
patent application was directed primarily to the way the
devices were assembled and, as I mentioned earlier in response
to Mr. Justice Portas's question, the two products were

20

included as covered by the agreement at that time because of

21

the similarity of the methods.

22

In 1957 Lear conducted a search of prior art and it

23

found that this raefchod could not be patentable to Adkins.

24

called the prior art to his attention and at that time it

25

renounced any further liability on Michigan steel

Prior to this amendment

Subsequent to this amendment it was

For example, prior to the amendment, the application

10

did not say one word about removable bearings, yet subsequent

??

to the amendment, the application contained such wording and

12

Adkins has relied very heavily on that added wording in

13

briefs for the California Supreme Court and also before this

14

court emphasizing this very feature that was added by

15

amendment many years later.
In early 1939 the claims directed to bearing

Well, no, your Honor.

As of this date 1955, the

two products were listed together.

11

we feel you cannot possibly get claims covering the process

12

on the Michigan product and we are going to continue on the

13

California model 2156.

As of this date, Lear said

Right here is where we come into the scope question

As to the whole works, your Honor.

Q

That right to terminate, was that confined to

the situation in which a patent did not issue?
A

5

No, your Honor, that provision appears in

6

section 2(a) of the license agreement.

pages

If I may direct your

"Lear shall have the right on ninety days prior

13

The state court, upon considering that specific

14

sentence, said,

15

that you cease manufacturing these devices before you can

16

"We find an implied condition that requires

18

20

the same thing.

21

implied condition and it is our position, your Honor, that

22

such an implied condition is most certainly contrary to the

23

purposes and provisions of the patent and anti-trust laws.

24
25

The intermediate appellate court said

The California Supreme Court found this

This is a circumstance that arose only upon
a decision of the California Supreme Court.

12

So as of

1

April 8, 1959, it was Lear’s position that the entire

2

agreement was cancelled which covered both of the products.

3

Some eight or nine months later Adkins pushed his

4

patent through the patent office, it was issued in early 1960

5

and the Complaint was filed on the same day.
The Complaint asserts two causes of action.

6

The

7

first cause of action alleged breach of the license agreement

0

and unjust enrichment after termination of agreement, and the

9

second cause of action asserted liability under state law

10

based on the alleged appropriation of Adkins’- ideas,

11

discoveries and invention in violation of his common law

12

right.

13

tried.

14

The second cause of action was dismissed and was never

The trial court ruled that Lear terminated the

15

license agreement by this notice in 1959 and the jury

16

returned a verdict for Adkins on the basis of both products,

17

the California and Michigan steel gyros.

18

granted Lear's motion notwithstanding the verdict concerning

19

the Michigan gyros and left the directed verdict concerning

20

the California gyros stand.

21

had no liability with respect to the Michigan steel gyros

22

because they were independently developed and also

23

the patent is invalid as far as that trial court is concerned

24

The intermediate appellate court of California ruled generally

25

along the same line.

The trial court

The trial court said that Lear

I won't discuss it because that decision
13

1
2

i is rendered a nullity when the Supreme Court takes the case.
The California Supreme Court held that this

3 i termination was ineffective because of this implied condition
4

that we have just mentioned.

It then adopted the defense of

5

licensee estoppel which was asserted by Adkins and held that

6

tear was estopped to contest the validity of the patent
and was liable for royalties.

8

It also used some criteria in ascertaining the

9

scope of the infringement and invention that we feel are

10

n

clearly in violation of decisions of this court.
For example* under the decision of the California

12

Supreme Court Lear has two alternatives.

13

royalties regardless of the patent invalidity and failure of

14

consideration or cease manufacturing the devices.

15

deprived of the alternative of continuing the manufacture of

10

the products reportedly covered by the claims of the Adkins

17

patent application and challenging validity and this renders

18

any licensee that challenges validity vulnerable to suit for

19

infringement and imposition of damages which may foe of much

20
21
22
23
24

25

One is to pay

It is

i greater magnitude than those imposed upon an agreement.
So a licensee has to be very well advised before he
I wants to take such a step.
Q

Don't you have to treat the Michigan steel gyro

problem as a license to use know-how or an unpatented article?
A

No, your Honor.
14

1

Q

2

law?

3

bothers me.

Why do you talk about that in terms of patent

That is a question I put to you initially and it still

I

4

A

Your Honors you are going right to the crux of

5

one of the issues in this case.

6

rights involved here, patents and common law rights are

7

muf ua1ly exc1usive.

8

9

Q

That is, any common let*

That is what I am trying to get ait.

I really

don’t understand it.

10

A

Well, your Honor, the agreement is explicit

11

and this agreement superseded, cancelled all other agreements.

12

Lear, for example, wanted to go into things of that nature

13

and it presented an exhibit U for admission into evidence

14

under an offer of proof.

15

Adkins

16

agreement s

17
18

At reporter's transcript 1018 where

says in representations leading

up to the license

'It is impossible for me to give Lear a license
on claims which may not be allo'wed or are not patentable."

19

Evidence along this line was excluded by the trial

20

court.

21

and this agreement limits you to patented or patentable

22

things and not secret ideas, not discoveries, and nothing

23

unpatentable is covered."

24
25

The trial court said^

"You are under this agreement

As a matter of fact, your Honor, there was a waiver
just before trial of all causes of action other than the

issues raised by the license agreement.

4

mention ideas.

5

are patented or patentable and hence we subra.it that brings

6

that directly under the Federal criteria concerning patent

7

matters.

8
9

So all ideas are out

Know-how is out of the picture.

The license

The only thing it mentions are things that

The major question before this court is the
enforceability of such agreement containing a restraint

30

which is outside the scope of the rights provided by the

11

patent laws.

12

Number two, the applicability of license estoppel

13

under the circumstances of this case and as a general

14

principle, whether the claims of the Adkins patent application

15

are really unpatentable and invalid as a matter of law like

16

the Superior Court of the State of California held,, and

17

whether ground rules of enforcing patents under a license

18

agreement are the same as they are in enforcing a patent

19

in an infringement action.

20

The California State Supreme Court didn't use the

21

same ground rules.

22

that the Michigan steel gyros are covered by the claims of the

Otherwise, they could have never held

25

patent.
As to question number one, enforceability of such
agreement, the requirement that Lear cease manufacturing the
16

products coveted by the license agreement in order to
2

terminate is not a right granted by the patent laws.

3

Independency of a patent application provides no vested

4

rights.

5

submit, is similar to the situation in Brulotte versus Thys

In fact, the patent may never issue and this, we

where this court held that an agreement which attempts to
extend patent rights beyond the 17-year period, patents are
j

good for 17 years and if a patent is attempted to be extended
beyond that period, it is an improper use of patent rights.
We submit that the very same considerations apply

10
«1

here where the patent rights are attempted to be extended

12 1

before they really issue.

13

which the California Supreme Court found was implied in the

14

agreement renders it unenforceable.

We submit that such a provision

15

Such an unwarranted extension of patent rights is

16

;

particularly objectionable here where products affected are

|

military equipment.

17
is

This is because of the policy embodied

!

in 28 U.S.Go 1498 which permits use toy the government of
1

all inventions without possibility of injunction and which

20

also safeguards the government from payment of royalties on

21

specious patents because validity can also be attacked.

22

With reference to the second major question

23

concerning estoppel, the government has filed a brief as

24

amicus curiae urging that this court should reject any

25

license estoppel.

I am advised that the counsel for the
17

i)

1

government, Mr» Wallace, will direct his oral argument to

2

the broad grounds and accordingly X will discuss the

3

circumstances of this case.

Under the circumstances of this case Lear

specifically renounced any liability.

It renounced liability

with respect to the Michigan steel gyros in 1957.

11

lVzeltine case in support of his position.

He elected to bring

Lear is doing the same thing

The defense's failure of consideration is a well

10

established defense in contract matters and that is what Lear

11

asserted and that is a defense of record in the trial court,

12

in the pleadings, and we submit that doctrine of license

13

estoppel should not override such a well known and undisputed

14

defense.

15

j

The second circumstance of this case was that the

16

license to Lear was granted under patent application that was

17

altered by amendment.

Numerous amendments were filed in this
i

18

application and, as I pointed out, one of major importance was

19

filed in December 1958 which changed the tenure of things.

20

The patent was issued with claims Lear had never seen.

21

To invoke a rule of estoppel under such circumstances

We submit that licensee estoppel should not apply

2
d

if the agreement is based upon a patent application which is

4

in fact amended from time to time after execution of the

5

agreement *

6

The third circumstance of this case is that* es 1

7

have already mentioned, the license agreement as construed by

8

the California Supreme Court embodies an implied condition

8

for termination that requires Lear to cease manufacturing the

10

n

products of the agreement in order to terminate.
As this court held in MacGregor versus Westinghouse,

12

the rule of licensee estoppel cannot be used as a shield to

13

preclude investigation of the validity of a patent where, in

14

the absence of a valid patent, it v/ould be a restraint of

15

trade, and certainly that is the circumstance here.

16

The requirement that Lear cease manufacturing the

17

device is a restraint of trade and licensee estoppel should

18

not be employed as a shield to prevent Lear from defenses

19

concerning this issue.

20

Any one of these three circumstances is sufficient

21

to override any estoppel if any vestage of the doctrine still

22

survives and Mr. Wallace will discuss that on behalf of the

23

government.

and one figure illustrating the Michigan steel gyro.

13

Towards the end of page

Adkins' patent shows a bearing-supporting apparatus

14

which employs a cone shaped seat in a girabal housing and

15

spherical bearing cups and the patent states that those

16

elements are shown at both the top and bottom of the figures

17

concerning Adkins' patent and I will elaborate on that a

18

little more in a moment.

19

The patent states that the bearings may be aligned

20

by placing them on a jig or mandrel and then placing them

21

in a bearing-receiving element, as I have illustrated.

22

When the mandrel is rotated, it causes the bearings

23

to become aligned and this is accommodated by engaging

24

surfaces between cylindrical shaped bearing cups and cone

25

shaped seats in view of their different curved shaped cups.

contention in its brief in this court.
Respondent contends that the estoppel issue is not

courts that Federal law gave it the right to contest the

validity of the patent, but in our examination of the briefs

6

that have been certified to this court a3 a part of the

7

record, we see that Lear did make this claim based on Federal

8

law in the briefs.

.9

I believe the clearest example can be found on

10

pages 25 through 28 of Lear's reply brief in the District

11

12

also becomes the brief in the Supreme Court.

Does it make any difference where that broad

8

Q

statement came from?

10

A

We are of the opinion that since the question

1?

of Federal law was presented to the court and the court

12

rejected that contention by applying the doctrine of

13

estoppel# that this necessarily meant that the California

14

Supreme Court passed on the question of Federal law.

15

In the pages that I referred you to in the brief

16

before the California court, we are of the view that because

17

only Federal authorities are cited throughout these three

18

and a half pages and the argument ends at that point and a

19

new point is taken up# the clear intention of these pages of

20

the brief is to raise these issues as a Federal claim and

21

this was sufficient under the standard which this court

22

applied in Braniff Airways, Inc, against Nebraska State

23

Board of Equalization in 347 U. S. where the clear

24

intention was to assert a Federal claim.

25

terminology need be followed in presenting that claim so

It is true that this reply brief raising the issue

3

was concerned only with the aspects of the case relating to

4

the so-called California gyro and not to the Michigan gyro,

5

but it is also true that the State Supreme Court consolidated

6

all of the aspects of the case together into one appeal and

7

into one Opinion and thus had this Federal claim before it

8

and passed upon it for purposes of the entire case.

9

But even in the absence of consolidation in the

10

court below, the issue of licensee estoppel would still be

11

before this court because a part of the judgment awarded is

12

for royalties for manufacture of the California gyro, the

13

claimed invention, with respect to which this point is

specifically raised.

In that case the issue of the validity of the

This court in its discretion could

It follows also that the doctrine of licensee

22

estoppel is applicable and Lear is foreclosed from

23

challenging the validity of Adkins3 patent.

24
25

As we read the California decision, therefore, the
United States believes that the issue is before this court
33

and we have addressed ourselves to the issue of whether the
licensee

estoppel doctrine should now he eliminated in

view of the weight and teaching of this court’s decisions
in recent years which required exceptions to the doctrine
and which otherwise have closely confined court enforcement
of monopolies to the limited scope authorised by the Federal
patent law.
Under our patent system, unlike that of some
European countries, patent monopolies are granted in
essentially ex parte non-adversary administrative proceedings
and this court and other courts and Congress have had
frequent occasions to observe that this system results in
the issuance of numerous patents for articles which do not
meet the requisite standard of invention upon later
investigation, an adversary investigation.
Therefore, as we show in our brief, the public
interest is strongly dependent upon our patent system and
on the availability of opportunities for private litigants
to expose invalid patent monopolies before the court in
order to free the public from their economic effects.
In many instances a licensee may be the only
potential litigant who combines the requisite knowledge with
the requisite incentive to mount that challenge.

The

practicalities of the business situation may well have
induced a licensee to enter into the license agreement even
34

i

though he had doubts about the validity of the patent or

2

had not had time to investigate the question of. the validity»

3

For examplet a government contractor such as the

4

petitioner must assure himself before he submits his bid

5

that he will be able to perform the contract and this means

6

that he must have a legal right to make and sell every

7

component required.

8

9
10
11

When some of those components are covered in issued
patents or patent applications, the pressure to enter into
license agreements would seem obvious.
The basic

vice of the estoppel doctrine is that

i2

it converts those licenses into incontestable devices for

13

economic effectuation of invalid patent monopolies.

14

instructive to remember that this court’s early recognition

15

of the doctrine of patent licensee estoppel in the 1855 case

16

of Kinsman v. Parhhurst,

17

was recognition, not a holding there, this occurred 35 years

18

prior to the enactment of the Sherman anti-trust law when the

19

patent laws were not yet viewed as a carefully confined

20

exception to the broad interdiction of monopolization in the

21

anti-trust laws, and this court's first significant

22

limitation of the estoppel doctrine, Pope Manufacturing

23

Company versus Gormully, occurred in 1892, two years after

24

enactment of the Sherman lav;.

25

j

It is

and as we point out in our brief, it

Later in the Sola Electric, Katzinger and MacGregor
35

i

1

cases discussed in our brief* this court held that the

2

estoppel doctrine may not be applied when the license agreement

3

contains a price fixing clause and in Scott Paper Company

4

versus Marcalus Manufacturing Company, the court held that an

5

assignor cannot be estopped from showing he was not infringing

6

the assigned patents because he was using only the prior art

7

of expired patents even though in the circumstance this

8

amounted to a showing that the patent he assigned had been

9

anticipated and was therefore invalid.

10

In his perspective and candid dissenting opinions

11

in those cases, Ms:. Justice Frankfurter pointed out that the

12

general doctrines of the assignor estoppel and licensee

13

estoppel really could not withstand the rationale of those

14

decisions and ultimately would have to yield to the same

15

considerations of the public interest that govern the

16

court's decisions in those cases.

n

But several years later the majority of the court

18

tersely reindorsed the general doctrine of licensee

19

estoppel in the Hazeltine case and said that the previous

20

cases meant that estoppel was forbidden only if licensee

21

attempts to enlarge patent monopoly through price fixing,

22

for example.

23

As Mr. Justice Douglas, joined by Mr. Justice Black,

24

! asked him to dissent in that case, what more enlargement is

25

: there from the standpoint of public harm than detachment
36

1

of patent monopoly to unpatentable monopoly.

2

opinion did not anower that question.

3

unanswered and the United States submits that the question is

4

unanswerable»

5

The majority

The question remains

More recently in the Sears Roebuck versus Stiffel

6

and Compco cases this court held that the states cannot

7

confer upon the originator of a design the power to exclude

e

others from copying that design# that the power to exclude

9

is the exclusive province of the Federal patent laws and can

10

attach only to avail a Federal patent.
The power to exclude others from making, using or

11
12

selling, which is conferred by a patent, is often utilised

13

by the patentee in order to reap economic award from the

14

patent.

15

they buy it from him or excludes others from making and

16

selling the product unless they pay him and agree upon a

17

royalty.

18

He excludes others from using the product unless

This is precisely the power to exclude which the

19

decision below has given to the respondent, even if his patent

20

is invalid and California has thus used the doctrine of

21

licensee estoppel to trespass upon the domain of the Federal

22

patent laws and to enlarge the impact on the economy of patent

23

monopoly rights from that which is authorised by the Federal

24

laws, just as the Illinois law of unfair competition has been

used in Stiffel and Compco ' to trespass upon Federal domain
37

1

and enlarge monopoly powers.

2

In those cases this court held that the states must

3

be confined to remedies that are compatible with policies of

4

Federal law such as requirement of labeling.

S

Likewise here we have argued in the concluding

6

pages of our brief that the states may devise remedies to

7

promote equity between businessmen .which do not conflict with

8

Federal law but the states should be barred from sacrificing

8

the public interest by applying doctrines of estoppel that

10

result in enforcement of monopolies that are not authorized

11

by Federal law.

12

The United States asks the court in this case to

13

relieve the people of this country from the burden of having

14

to pay royalties for the use of a non«invention and give the

15

people what the Constitution says is rightfully theirs, the

16

free use of all of the technology that is in the public

17

domain.

18

Q

Assuming that the Michigan patent here is

19

available and assuming that the petitioner can avail itself

20

of that patent, does that in your judgment dispose of the

21

claim with respect to compensation for the use of the

22

Michigan device 7

23
24
25

A

The United States has not really formulated a

position on that question.
Q

You are doing something more than asking us to
38

1

make a ruling in the abstract here, aren't you?
A

2
3

California device at all.
Q

5

Of course, there is no problem with the

There is no question about the validity of

the California patent, is there, in this case?
A

6

Yes, there was estoppel applied with respect

7

to both patents and Lear was estopped from contesting the

8

validity of either patent and the judgment reflects royalties

9

for the use of both patents»
Q

10

But has there been an adjudication that the

11

Michigan patent is invalid in this case? .There hasn’t,- has

12

there ?

13
14

A

No, there has not because the trial court held

that Lear was estopped from the outset.

15

Q

Was there adjudication?

16

A

It was at the trial court that the Michigan

17
18

device was held to be invalid.
Q

So that we do have that difference in the posture

19

of the case in any event between these two patents and you

20

have made no study of the impact of accepting your theory

21

with respect to whether a claim survives?

22
23
24
25

A

I have made a study of it but the United States

has not taken a position with respect to that question.
Q

You haven't made a study that is helpful to us.

Thank you, sir.

Q

Isn't it true that no royalties were payable

except on patented or patentable articles under this
agreement ?
h

The agreement so stated and the basis for the

5

royalty payments having been awarded in the judgment of the

6

California court is that Lear was estopped to contest the

7

validity of either patent»
