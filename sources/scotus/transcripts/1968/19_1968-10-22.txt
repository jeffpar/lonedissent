PROCEEDIN G S

I.J

THE CLERK:

Counsel are present.

3

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Number 19, Universal

4

Interpretive Shuttle Corp. versus Washington Metropolitan Area

5

Transit Commission, et al.

6

Mr. Cunningham, you may continue your argument.

7

MR. CUNNINGHAM:

8

the Court.

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

I feel in closing I would like to stress and accentua ;e
two points the Commission feels very strongly about.

u

First, we feel that there must be an accommodation

12

made between the laws of the Secretary of the Interior and the

13

Compact.

14

irreconcilable conflicts on the streets of Washington served by

15

carriers subject to our jurisdiction and those operating pur­

16

suant to the franchise of the Secretary.

17

Otherwise, we fear deeply that there will be

We feel that someone must be in a position to resolve

18

any irreconcilable conflicts on the one hand, and on the other

19

hand to coordinate and improve in every fashion all of these

20

transportation services.

21

This may be accomplished not by accepting the argumen

22

of the Petitioners that the Secretary's laws are mutually

23

exclusive and the Compact cannot be applied.

24
25

We feel very strongly that there will be no mischief.
no harm done, if the Court accepts the view of the Commission
63

1

that the Compact is applicable, that dual jurisdiction does

i-H

9

exist, that, on the one hand, the Secretary of Interior has

3

ministerial duties and the right to organize and supervise

4

the transit service on the Mall or between any Park properties.
On the other hand, we feel that the Congress very

S
6

clearly did not intend that any public transportation service

7

would be excluded from the regulation by the transit commission

8

Q

I thought you told us yesterday that if the Secretary

‘0

of the Interior did it himself the Commission would have no

20

jurisdiction.

11

A

That is true, sir.

22

Q

Would you have the same conflict then that you would

13

have under this arrangement?

24

A

Quite possibly.

15

Q

What is the difference?

20

A

The difference is, Mr. Chief Justice, I feel that

VJ

Congress, when it enacted the exemption by thi Federal govern­

18

ment, or signatories, intended to leave a small area open

19

whereby the Government could operate its own service and follow

20

the traditional regulatory scheme, statutory regulatory schemej

ai

that where the Government itself provided the service, that

23

service is not regulated by another Governmental agency, but,

23

on the other hand, where it does require a private carrier to

24

provide that same service, then that service must be regulated.

25

That is the holding of the USAC transport case and that
64

1

has been the holding of every Supreme Court case and State

2

court decision that I know of.

3

This is the primary distinction.

I think clearly this was a scheme that existed prior

A

to the enactment of the Compact and is what the Congress and

13

State legislatures intended to be accomplished in the future.

6

We don't feel there will be any problem arising under

7

this dual jurisdiction.

The regulatory agency in most instances

8

accepts the managerial decisions of the owners of transit

3

companies, and in this case the Secretary is free to contract

10

with the concessionaire and supervise it day and night and

n

we welcome a service of this kind.

12

But we feel there must be an accommodation between

13

the Secretary's service and a melding of that service and

?4

supervision of that service under the regulatory concept by the

25

Commission.

26

Q

If you are correct, it seems to me that this is not

27

transportation by the United States, then the exemption in the

28

Compact doesn't apply and your authority does exist.

29

A

Yes, sir.

20

Q

And it seems to me that the extent of the Secretary's

21

power in that situation would be just what you wanted it to be

22

and no more.

23

power.

24

Secretary.

25

You would have, if you wanted to have, exclusive

There wouldn't be any real legal authority in the

Isn't that right?

He would be operating at your
65

fj

'i

2

3
4

suffrage?

I am not saying that is wrong.

But, as a legal

matter, if the Compact applies, you have the authority?
A

I think, Mr. Justice White, there is a comingling

of authority.
On the one hand, we have the Secretary saying ”1 will

5
6

allow or I will provide certain service on the Mall area, and

1

1 will exclude what service that I feel there is no rational

0'

basis for it to be on there, because this Congress has said

9

I shall administer this problem, ’
On the other hand, the Congress has also said we

SO

11

want the transit commission to regulate a unified transit

12

system of all kinds throughout this metropolitan area.

13

Q

Why doesn’t that go so far

If you are right and

14

the exemption does not apply -- as to mean that your Commission

15

can exclude this service, if It's a transportation service, if

16

the choice of the Secretary is to franchise that to a private

17

operator?
Doesn't it go that far?

18
19

A

Yes, sir, I think it does.

20

Q

But what you are telling us is that isn't the way

2!
22

the Commission acts?
A

I am saying,in this instance, wherever a Governmental

23

agency comes in.

24

Secretary of the Interior, it would carry even more of a

25

preponderance of evidence and ’weight.

And I would think in this case, being the

66

That if the Secretary

1

came to the Commission and said --- I am sorry -- if a con­

2

cessionaire came to the Commission and said "We wish a cer­

3

tificate of public convenience and necessity, and here is a

4

contract from the Secretary of Interior saying we are the

5

only carrier that he Is going to permit to provide this service

6

on the Mall," I would think it's almost--

7

Q

That may be.

But in terms of power, and if you are

8

right and the exemption doesn't apply, you can still say to

9

the concessionaire, "no, we will not give you a certificate."

20

A

That is right.

And we feel this Is what Congress

1?

intended when they set up the Commission and said there will

22

no longer be any subdivision chopping up the Metropolitan

13

Transit.

14

Q

Not dual authority, one authority.

IS

A

There will only be one regulatory agency, yes, sir.

16

But, on the other hand, the Secretary's power to maintain and

1?

supervise and administer the Mall still remains open to him.

18

Q

If you permit it.

19

A

Yes, sir.

And we feel under this law this was a

20

statutory scheme that the Congress and Legislatures intended

21

it not only the Secretary of Interior would be subject to this

22

control, but any municipality, any town, any other federal

23

government agency, and in fact we have this going on today

.24

where we have contract services between various carrier's and

25

various federal agencies.
67

9•

I went into that aspect yesterday.

2

Mr. Chief Justice and the Court, that concludes my

3

argument this morning.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Davis.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MANUEL J. DAVIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE TRANSIT COMMISSION

1

MR. DAVIS:

S
9

Mr. Dr-vis has the remainder of the time

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.

10

I would like to cover an issue that was not covered

11

by Mr. Cunningham, but which was referred to by counsel for the

12

appellants in this proceeding: namely, the issue as to whether

13

or not the Congressional franchise granted to D. C. Transit

14

protected against such applicants as here today for the for

IS

hire transportation operation which Universal proposes to per­

16

form within the District of Columbia.

1?

D. C. Transit's franchise, as Public Law 757 7598,

m

grants a franchise to D. C„ Transit to perform a mass trans­

19

portation service in the District of Columbia and in the areas

20

which go on to comprise the Metropolitan district.

21

particular authority is set out in Section 1 of the said

22

franchise.

23

That

Two other sections in this franchise are materially

24

Important to the issue which I raised; namely, Section 3 and

25

Section 6.
68

5

If I may skip Section 3 for a moment.

2

grants to D. C. Transit the additional authority known as

3

Charter Sightseeing and contract authority within the areas

4

that I have described.

5

Section 6

Now, Section 3 of the Compact says that no authority

6

or certificate shall fee, granted to any applicant for that

7

authority if it intends to operate a given route over a fixed

8

schedule, unless the Commission, that is, the WMATC, finds

9

that public convenience and necessity demand said certificate,

30

The lower court in treating this question attempted

n

to allude to the fact, and did, as a matter of fact, that mass

12

transit referred solely to transit within the District of

13

Columbia.

14

Nov;, 31 am certain that a reading of that Section

15

will show that mass transit was not restricted to transit

16

solely within the District of Columbia, or to residents in the

17

District of Columbia, but applied to anyone within the areas

18

that we serve and any of the service we serve as a result of tl'

19

franchise and certificates which were eventually issued to us

20
21

by the WMATC as a result of the said certificates.
the
Section 3, which becomes/paramount section in this

22

case as far as our argument is concerned, definitely points

23

up that the service which they must endeavor to render must be

24

by a given route or over a fixed schedule.

25

Q

Do all of the sightseeing agencies in the District

69

a

3

of Columbia obtain franchises from the Commission?

2

A

Yes, sir, to the best of my knowledge.

3

Q

All of them that we see on the street?

4

individuals?

5

A

6

How about the

If they want to run a bus operation they must get a

certificate from the WMATC* yes* sir.
Now* it's hard for us to visualize the underlying

7
S

reason as to why the lower court endeavored to single out

9

Section 6 as not being protected by Section 3 of the Compact.
Perhaps it is because it was in a separate Section

10
11

in the Compact -- I am sorry -- in the franchise* and was set

12

out at a later time.

13

general reason* it would not necessarily fall within the

14

protection afforded to D, C. Transit under Section 3 of the

15

Compact.

16

But the court seemed to conclude* as a

We have endeavored* and I believe you will find in

i/

our brief* sufficient lav; and cases to show that it is possible

18

for a sightseeing operation to be over a given route and on a

19

fixed schedule.

20

The Courts have said it's possible that -- as a
matter of fact* D. C, Transit does it itself every day at a

21
22

That is easy to visualize.

.

given hour.

A particular sightseeing trip goes through the

23

Mall ar^ea which begins outside of the Mall and continues

24

around the areas described by the appellant as to the route

25

it will operate the service if the authority is granted to then
70

i

by the Secretary and is held to be valid.

z

Q

Who issued the franchise here?

C?o

A

The Congress of the United States.

4

Q

The specific franchise?

3

A

An Act of Congressa sir.

8

Q

Congress authorized it, but did they prepare the

7

exact Commission?

8

A

Yes, sir.

9

Q

Or did the Commission itself write the franchise?

10

A

The Commission was written.

11

Q

In other words, what I am trying to get at is this:

12

are we governed by the breadth of the Compact, or are we

13

governed by the breadth of the franchise?

14

A

15

Q

Can you tell me what is the statute that wrote that?

16

A

The statute to which I refer, sir, is public law

18

Q

Does that contain verbatim the franchise?

19

A

Yes, sir, it does.

20

Q

Is that in your brief?

21

A

Yes, sir.

22

Q

What page, may I ask?

\1

23

Of the franchise, I say, sir.

757.

Now, we get to the point and we are bound by the

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
more.

You may have five minutes

And, counsel, you may have five minutes more.

5

MR. DAVIS:

We get to Section 3.

And there we must

©

determine whether or not the service contemplated is over a

?

given route or on a fixed schedule.
As to that, the District Court went to great pains

Q

0

to set out the description of the given route -- and so we

30

didn’t go any further than that

33

will operate.

over which the respondent

32

That appears on page 32 of our Brief.

33

The fact that the Secretary has designated a given

14

route is further evidenced by the Respondent's Vice-President

15

when he enumerated the eleven points of Interest It will operat {Z\

16

over.

17

Q

Is there really any difference of opinion on the

18

question you are now covering, that is to say, that if Universal

19

Is to be considered In its purely private capacity and not as

20

an agent of the Secretary of Interior,it would have to get the

?J

necessary authority from the Commission?

22

Is there any conflict as to that?

23

A

Yes, sir.

24

Q

Why?

25

A

Universal was advised by the WMATC that if it
72

1

desired to render this service it would first have to secure

2

a certificate from the Commission.

3

Q

1 didn't make my question clear, I guess.
If you assume that Universal is operating In a

4
3

purely private capacity and not as the alter ego of the

Q

Secretary, there is no dispute, Is there, that Universal would

7

have to go to the Commission and get authority to perform the

Q

service that is here involved?
Is that In dispute or Is it not?

9

10

11
12

13

A

I say it's in dispute by Universal who says they do

not have to get such a certificate.
Q

Wall, that is the question.

They say they are

operating as the alter ego of the Secretary.

Is that correct?

14

A

That is correct.

13

Q

And if they were not operating as the alter ego of

IS

the Secretary, would they still contend they do not have to

17

get the permission of the Commission?

13

A

They haven't gotten to that point in their argument.

19

We have taken the position that under any circumstances they

20

must apply to the Commission for a certificate.

21

Q

The argument you are now making, your franchise

22

argument -- tell me if I am wrong ~~ is that the Secretary

23

himself cannot do this?

24

of your exclusive franchise?

25

A

He cannot make this contract because

We take that position.

Vie can't stop him from making,
73

1

a contract.

2

far as the operation by a concessionaire or private person in

o

this area.

i

But we believe the franchise does protect us as

4

Q

Or by the Secretary himself?

5

A

Or by the Secretary himself.

6

Q

Is that your position?

?

A

8

Cunningham.

9

as yet has come up with any law, whether it be case or statute

Yes, sir.

And in this respect we differ from Mr.

We say the Secretary has no authority.

And no one

10

law, which says the Secretary has any authority to operate this

11

service.

12

Q

What you say is that you have exclusive jurisdiction?

13

A

Subject to Section 3 of the franchise.

14
15

We are bound

by that Section.
Mow, if the Commission, in its wisdom, were to find

16

public needs and necessity required the service, it doesn’t

17

necessarily say it must give it to us.

18

in the Compact which says that nothing in the Compact shall

19

abridge or take away from D, C. Transit the rights which they

20

held under the franchise.

21

But there is a Section

There is such a Section.

There is another Section under the Compact that says

22

the Commission shall not grant the right to an applicant to

23

run over the routes of another applicant, andher operator,

24

without first giving that operator the right and opportunity

25

to render the service.

So that we feel our protection lies
74

1

z

within the franchise and the Compact.
Q

Then you would feel that if the Secretary undertook

3

to operate this service himself directly, he could not do it

4

without violating the terms of ~~ he could not do it?

5

A

That is correct.

6

Q

Your position differs from the position of your

7

colleague?

8

A

That is correct.

9

Q

It is important for us to know that that is the thrust

'20
ii

12

13
14

of your argument.
A

It definitely goes beyond that.

We contend definitely

he has no such authority to operate this service,
Q

But, nevertheless* that is only true If the service

is over a fixed route?

IS

A

On a fixed schedule.

10

Q

And that it is competitive with yours?

17

A

That Is correct* sir.

18

Q

Do you have authority now to operate any kind of a

19
20

sightseeing tour you want to in the Mall area?
A

We have authority from this Commission to operate

21

sightseeing services in the Mall.

22

We hold* in addition, ten different certificates.

23

One certificate for ten regular route operations in the Mall.

24
2S

Vie hold such a certificate.
I am sorry.

I would say that to the extent that Universal was
permitted to operate in the Mall* it would deprive Transit's

75

i

regular every day riders of the opportunity of riding exclusively

2

with D. C. Transit even in the Mall.
Q

3

You don't recognize that the Secretary has any

4

authority at all to regulate or forbid your operations in the

5

Mall?
A

6

He does, sir, under the Compact.

The Compact reserve s

7

to the Secretary, after suspending all the laws of the United

8

States which have any applicability to the transportation in

9

this area.

It sayd that the ordinary and normal police powers

10

are reserved to, and it enumerates various parties, one of

11

which is the--

12

Q

About the speed limits and things like that?

13

A

That is correct.

14

Q

Not about regulations?

15

A

16

ledge.

It reserves nothing like that to him, to my know­
That is right in the Compact.
Nov;, as to the competitive feature, I would like

17
18

to mention--

19

Q

Your franchise antedates the compact?

20

A

It does.

21

Q

You got the franchise directly from Congress in

23

A

Yes, sir.

24

Q

And the Compact came aloiug in i960?

25

A

That Is correct.

22

1956?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLYDE 0. MARTZ
ON BEHALF OF TBS UNITED STATES

/

8
9

I think, Mr. Davis, we

MR. MARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
Mr. Justice Fortas' Inquiries pointed up that we

3G
11

have apparently failed to make clear to the Court that we have

52

two separate and distinct bases for reversal.
First is the exclusion of the United States and its

13
14

concessionaire under the transportation for federal government

15

exclusion In

Article

12,

Section

1(a).

The second and completely independent basis for

IQ

17

reversal is that the Compact by its terms and by any reasonable

18

construction does not extend in to the National Park enclave

59

and does not purport to regulate activities of the federal

20

government or any contract party it might use in connection

21

with the operations inthe Mall.

22
23
24

25

This latter does not rest iUpon the exclusion in the Com ­
pact,

it goes to the scope, to the heart of the Compact Itself.
I think the legislative history and the language of

the Compact that was developed In the Briefs will make this

77

1

t

abundantly clear.
In the first place, the Compact in Article 8 called

2

3

for Congress to enact legislation that would suspend conflict­

4

ing federal statutes and to grant jurisdiction to the Commission

5

to carry out the Compact so far as necessary.
In Section 3 of House Joint Resolution 402, consent­

6
7

ing to the Compact, Congress performed this function.

It

8

granted to the Commission only the authority of the Interstate

9

Commerce Commisssion and the authority of the Public Utilities

JO

Commission.

tl

by the District Court in this case, had any certification

12

authority over any operation within the federal enclave.

13

Q,

Neither of those Commissions, in fact, as found

Mr. Marts, you have two quite distinct arguments,

14

both of which are answered or responded to, at least, by your

15

opponents.
In addition, they have a third argument, depending

16
17

not at all upon the Compact, but upon the 1956 franchise that

18

Congress directly gave to this Company.

19
20

21

Now, neither of your points really go to meeting
that argument.
A

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, in addition to the specif!

22

answers that were set out in anticipation by petitioner yester­

23

day, it's our general position that there is no difference in

24

construction between the franchise and the Compact.

25

Acts of Congress.

Both are

The construction of both raises the question

did they run against the sovereign?

You don't think there's two questions there, whether

6

they apply, even the franchise, to a direct operation by the

1

Secretary?

That is the first question.

8

And, secondly, whether if they do not in that instana

9

do they apply, or at least the franchise apply, to an operation

30

by the Secretary?
You don't think those are separate questions?

Ye submit that the same rules of construction would

apply to determine—
Q

So that if operation by the Secretary is not involved

15

at all, only the right of the franchise or the Compact, then

16

it is immaterial whether the operation by the Secretary is

17

by himself directly or by him through an independent contractor

18

A

That is our position, conditioned, as explained

m

yesterday, by the fact that this is a concession contract, in

20

accordance with Congressional policy, to carry out the govern­

z\

mental program within the National Park enclaves.

22

Q

Do you suppose that the federal government Itself,

23

or the District of Columbia as a municipal government, despite

24

this franchise given to this Company by Congress in 1956, could

25

all of a sudden say "we are now going to have governmentally
79

1

owned and operated public transportation in the District of

2

Columbia: we are not going to pay a nickel to the franchisee;

3

no condemnation, no purchase involved, because we are the

4

government and this franchise doesn't affect us”?
The franchise by its terms permits termination after

The District of Columbia could do

It could as long as the Compact remains in effect.
Q

I am not talking about the Compact.

I am talking

about the franchise.
A

I should have said as long as the franchise remains

in effect.

12

Q

That is putting aside the termination question?

I think we are obligated to protect the regular

route service of the franchise operator.

17

And not to compete with it on a governmental

It depends on whether the franchise extends into the

28

National Park enclave and affects the operation of the Seeretar y

19

of Interior directly or through his agents.

20

Q

Could the Secretary of the Interior Department say

21

"We are going to establish and operate a public transportation

22

system in the City of Washington despite this franchise"?

23

24
23

A

It has no authority to do so outside of the Park

enclave.
Q

Your point, as I understand it, is that the charter

1

did not include this servide in the park enclave that is at

2

issue here?

3

A

That is correct. And Respondent has acknowledged this

by getting permits for the movement of his vehicles through the

5

Park.

Permits from i-fhom, the Secretary?

Yes.

Q

In addition to the other?

9

A

Yea, sir*.

10

Q

I thought your further argument was this didn't run

11

against the Government at all, this didn't run against the

12

sovereign?

13

37

A

As a rule of construction, a franchise is not

presumed to run against the sovereign.
Q

Isn't the franchise in the nature of a license

agreement or contract?
A

It's a contract to provide protection from competition
I

by private enterprise within the area, not from the government

19

itself in its use of federal properties.

Go ahead and finish your

statement.
MR. MARTZ:

At page 88 of the appendix sets out the

jurisdiction of the park and shows that Constitution Avenue

from

5th Street west, which was questioned yesterday, is

2

wholly within the park enclave and can be operated not under

a

the Section 8 44 jurisdictional decision, but as part of the

park itself.

This is all of Constitution Avenue?

5th Street to the west.

As shown on Government

Exhibit 6 set out in the appendix at page 83.

Q

Who polices that, the Metropolitan Police or Park

Police?
A

Both can do it.

Under the laws of the District of

11

Columbia, the federal law, the Park Police can police all park

12

lands and the Metropolitan Police can do so also.
