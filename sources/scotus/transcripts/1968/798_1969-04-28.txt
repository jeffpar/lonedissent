ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD

8

1!

Counsel are present.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court.
This is a school desegregation case

The question

arises here, hwoever, with respect to faculty desegregation
rather than directly with student desegregation.
The issue is a rather narrow but important one.

It

arises with respect to the schools of Montgomery County,
Alabama, including not only those in the city of Montgomery
but also those in the surrounding county area
For the 1967-68 school year the defendants operated
52 schools, including 32 predominantly white and 20 predomi­
nantly Negro schools.
There were approximately 22,500 white students
and 17,000 Negro students taught by approximately 815 white
teachers and 550 Negro teachers.
This suit began with a complaint whach was filed on

25

3

1

May llf 1964, almost five years ago.

2

District Court stated in its opinion —- and this is at page 524

3

of the printed record — the Montgomery County Board of

4

Education had taken no steps and had made no plans whatsoever

5

to comply with the law of this land in the area of school

6

desegregation even though ten years had passed when this

7

matter came on for a hearing in 1964, the Montgomery County

0

Board ■ of

9

desegregation gradually for the reason that it was realized

At that time as the

Education was allowed by this court to proceed with

10

that desegregation of the public schools cut across the social

11

fabric of this community and that there would be both

12

administrative and other practical problems for the Board to

13

cope with.

Vy :

'i

And the court went on to show the way in which it had

14
I/;’ '

i

15

helped to cooperative with the Board in moving forward in this

16

and concluded, however, we have reached the point where we

17

must pass tokenism and the order that was entered in this

18

case bn February 24, 1968, is designed to accomplish this

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

purpose.
It was not designed to and was not intended to
accomplish and if complied with will not require more than the
Supreme Court of the United States and the ether appellate
courts have held must be accomplished in order to desegregate
a public school system.
Well, now, what had been done since the suit was
4

1

filed in 1964?

2

the court entered on July 31, 1964, the Board permitted

3

transfers under the Alabama school placement law in four grades.

4

Grade 1, and grades 10, 11 and 12 in the senior high school.

there were 8 Negro students in what had previously been white

11

schools.

Forty-nine Negro students applied to attend
The defendants rejected appli­

On appeal to the court, the court overturned six of
the rejections but accepted the remainder.

This made 24

students who were admitted to the schools.
In 1966-67, approximately 330 Negro students chose
to attend white schools, traditionally v/hite schools in
Montgomery County.

No white student chose to attend tradi­

tionally Negro schools.
This was the first year that the School Board oper­
ated under a freedom of choice plan without initial assignment
on the basis of race, except in the two grades which were not
5

T

yet covered by the desegregation plan which were Grades 5 and 6.

2

In the year 1967-68 was the first year that all

3

twelve grades were to be formally desegregated.

4

550 Negro students attended traditionally white schools.

5

white students attended Negro schools and in the year 1968-69,

S

the current year, there are approximately 950 Negro students

7

in 30 traditionally white schools, and approximately 16,500,

8

or 94 percent in all Negro schools.

Approximately

There are no white students in Negro schools.

9

No

So

10

that in summary as of today, no white student has ever attended

11

a traditionally Negro school in Montgomery County.

12

of Negro students attending traditionally white schools has

13

slowly increased until at the present time it is 950 which

14

seems like a substantial number, but it is less than 6 percent

15

of the Negro students in Montgomery County School System.

Q

Thank you.

A

The complaint in this case as I have said

filed on May 11, 1964.

was

In it the plaintiff sought faculty

desegregation.
The court's first order made no specific reference to
faculty desegregation, but it did require the: defendants to
submit a plan designed to eliminate segregation of students
based upon race and the complete elimination of the b.i-racial
school system within a reasonable time.
The defendant's first segregation plan was submitted

I

in January 1965, and it was silent as to faculty desegregation, j
The plaintiffs objected to what the court declined
to act beyond ordering the defendants for the second time to
submit a plan for the complete elimination of the bi-racial

25

7

1

2

school system within a reasonable time.
The defendant's second desegregation plan was sub­

3

mitted in January 1966* and it* too* was silent as to faculty

4

desegregation.

5

objected, and on March 22, the District Court ordered the

6

Board to adopt a desegregation plan providing in part — and

7

this appears on page 337 of the printed record -- that race

8

or color will henceforth not be a factor in the hiring assign­

9

ment, reassignment promotion, demotion or dismissal of teachers

Both the plaintiffs and the Government

and other professional staff with the exception that assign­
ments shall be made in order to eliminate the effects of past
discrimination.
Teachers, principals and staff members will be
assigned to schools so that the faculty and staff is not com­
posed of members of one race.
And that is a fine statement but a completely general
in its terms.
Judge Johnson at that time stated from the bench that
I will not expect too much of it.

meaning facility desegre­

gation in September *66 because of the timing, but I will expect
a considerable amount of it effective in September e67.
However, in August of 1966, following the decision
of the Court of Appeals in a case involving the Mobile schools,
Judge Johnson sua sponte declared that the Montgomery Board
would have the same period available as the Court of Appeals

25

8

1

had established for Mobile and that they would be allowed until

2

the school year '67-68 to commence desegregation of the faculty

■n

and professional staff in the Montgomery County School System.
At that time the defendants had tentatively assigned

4
5

four teachers of each race to teach in high schools attended

6

predominantly by students of the opposite race for the '66-67

7

year.

3
9

10

But after Judge Johnson's modification in August 1966,
these assignments were not implemented.
On June 1, 1967, the District Court ordered the

11

defendants to adopt the desegregation plan with faculty pro­

12

visions substantially similar to that which it had ordered

13

in March, 1966, but with certain additions.

14

The court indicated for the first time that its

15

desegregation order was to extend to student teachers. Also

16

the court directed, and this appears at page 454 of the

17

18

printed record, wherever possible, teachers will be assigned
so that more than one teacher of the minority race, white or

19

Negro, will be on a desegregated faculty.

20

take positive and affirmative steps to accomplish the deseg­

21

regation of its school faculties, including substantial

22

desegregation of faculties in as many of the schools as possible

tracts for the 67-68 or 68-69 school year have already been
signed and approved.

with no appreciable specifics in it.

teachers of each race to schools predominantly of the opposite
race.

The ten teachers taught only at four ligh schools in

the city of Montgomery, none in any elementary schools, none
in any of the schools outside of the city, except that in the
elementary schools the defendants did assign three white speech
therapists to teach in all elementary schools.
On August 17, 1967, the Government objected to the
defendants failure to bring about more faculty desegregation
and move for further relief.
The plaintiffs in the action joineJ in the motion.
There was a hearing in September, 1967, and the Superintendent
of the Montgomery School Board, Mr. McKee, explained the
defendant’s failure to assign desegregating faculty members to
48 of their 52 schools.
He said, "We felt there xvould be less objection in
the senior high schools because one teacher would not have the

23

pupils as much of the day as they would in the lower grades. "
24
He acknowledged reassigning over 40 Hegro teachers from schools

i

closed pursuant to court order to other Negro schools for
the 67-68 school year.
He also acknowledged assigning over SO new teachers
for the 67-68 school year to schools where their race pre­
dominated.

The court declined to enter any further order in

the fall of '67.
However, in January of 1968, the District Court set
the August '67 motion of the United States down for a second
hearing in February, 1968, a little over a year ago.
Both the Government and the plaintiffs filed supple­
mental motions for further relief shortly before the hearing.
In the meantime the defendants had signed six cr seven addi­
tional white teachers to three or four more traditionally Negr
schools, so that seven or eight of the 52 schools had deseg­
regated facilities.
The chief evidence concerning desegregation is
r •

;

-

i

summarized in the District Court's opinion of February 24,
1968.

This is on page 493 and 494 of the printed record.
Since the order of this court on June 1, 1967, Judge

Johnson said, "Defendants have assigned or transferred approxi
mately 75 new teachers to faculties where their race was in
the majority.

Since the opening of school in September 1967,

defendants have hired approximately 32 new teachers, 26 white
i

and six Negro.
Of the 26 new white teachers, only 6 or 7 have been
11

1

placed in predominantly Negro schools»

2

assigned to predominantly Negro schools” and the judge went

3

on to say the defendants have adopted no adequate program for

4

the assignment of student teachers on a desegregated basis,,

5

All six Negroes were

None of the approximately 150 student teachers used

'6

in the Montgomery County School System in the fall of 1967 were

7

assigned to schools predominantly of the opposite race»

8

Negro student teachers have very recently bean assigned to

9

predominantly white schools.

10
11
12

Four

There has been no faculty desegregation in the night
schools operated by the Montgomery County School System.
Now Judge Johnson could have added that the defendants

13

had continued their policy of assigning Negro teachers only

14

to Negro schools and dthe two traditionally white senior high

15

schools in the city of Montgomery.

16

They had assigned no Negro teachexs to traditionally

17

white elementary or junior high schools or to a predominantly

18

white senior high school outside of Montgomery.

19

No teacher was assigned to teach an academic subject

20

in a traditionally white school.

2!

fled that the defendants assigned white teachers to Negro

22

schools only if the teachers expressed a willingness to teach

23
24
25

Superintendent McKee testi”

there even though the superintendent knew,, le testified,, that
the law did not permit him to rely on voluntariness.
The defendants continued to hire rew white teachers
12

1

whose application showed that they would not accept integrated

2

faculties.

The defendants assigned Negro teachers to Negro
i

o

schools even though they were willing to teach at traditionally

4

white schools because of the defendant's concern for the

5

reaction of white community members.
And so in summary, at the time the crder with which

6

7

we are concerned was entered, prior to 1967, there was no

8

faculty desegregation.

9
10

and 6 Negro out of over 1350 were assigned to schools where
'
their race was in the minority.
Pour of over 300 student teachers were assigned to

11
12
13
14

desegregating positions.

17
18

21

Night school facilities were

segregated.
During the year 1968-69, since the order of the court
below, 216 teachers have been assigned to desegregating
positions.

Now in this situation what was the order of Judge

Johnson?
It appears on pages 503 to 510 of the record but it

19

20

No Negro substituted for a teacher

in a traditionally white school.

15
16

During 1967-68, 32 teachers, 26 white

was then amended on pages 520 to 523, and I think the most
convenient place to examine it is as it is set out in the
opinion of the Court of Appeals where it is set out with the

22
amendments incorporated, and that appears on page 754 of the
23
record.
24
It is there exactly the same as in the references I
25

13

*3!
Ui

previously gave except the amendments have been read in.

2

It starts out. on page 754,, "Statement of Objective.”

3

In achieving the objective of the school system that

4

the pattern of teacher assignments to any particular school
j

5

shall not be identifiable as tailored for a heavy concentration

6

of either Negro or white pupils in the school, the School Board

7

will be guided by the ratio of Negro to white faculty members

8

in the school system as a whole and that is about 60-40, about

9

3 to 2, three white to two Negro.

10

The School Board will accomplish faculty desegregation

11

by hiring and assigning faculty members so that in each school

12

the ratio of white to Negro faculty members is substantially

13

the same as it is throughout the system.

14

At present the ratio is approximately 3 to 2.

15

This will be accomplished in accordance with the

16

schedule set out below.

17

Then under B, '’Schedule of Faculty Desegregation.'*

13

1968-69, that is the current school year, every
i

19

school with fewer than 12 teachers the Board will have at least

20

one full-time teacher whose race is different from the race

21

of the majority of the faculty and staff members of the school.

22

At every school with 12 or more teachers, the race
I

23

of at least one of every six faculty and staff members will

24

be different from the race of the majority of the faculty and

25

staff members at the school, and then the court will reserve
14

1

for the time being other specific faculty and staff desegre­

2

gation requirements for future years.
So that though there is a statement of objective in

3
4

terras of 3 to 2* the only order of the court was that in

5

schools of 12 or more faculty members * the rat io should be

6

5 to L

7

Now that,, it seems to me* is not as mechanical or

8

rigid as it might seem when one examines the opinion of the

9

Court of Appeals.
I call attention to the top of the court’s opinion*

10

11

the top of page 759 where the court has in large capital

12

letters* "Fixed Mathematical Ratio."
The Court of Appeals because of that fixed mathe­

13
14

15
16
17
IS

matical ratio made two changes in the decree of the District
Court.

Instead of maintaining the 5 to 1 ratio with respect

to schools of 12 or more* it required inserting substantially
or approximately 5 to 1, and then on page 765 of its opinion*
it struck out the 3 to 2 ratio entirely.
On page 765 the Court said, "There must be a good

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

faith and effective beginning and a good faith and effective
effort to achieve faculty and staff desegregation for the
entire system* although a ratio of substantiall.y or approxi­
mately 5 to 1 is a good beginning we cannot say that a ratio
of substantially 3 to 2 simply because it mirrors the ratio
balance of the entire faculty must be achieved as a final
objective.

15

1

And so the ratio

provisions of the District Court5s

2

opinion were left out and the only thing that was left in to

3

guide the future development here is that there must be a good

4

faith and effective beginning and good faith and effective

5

effort to achieve faculty and staff desegregation.

G

Now that obviously is v;hoily vague and uncertain and

7

it means that the case must be tried anew every time it comes

3

up at large and not merely on matters of detail in connection

9

with the practical problems of complying with the decree.

10

Q

It is also the requirement of approximately

11

5 to 1 for the first school year and I suppose the Court of

12

Appeals approved that, didn't it?

13
14

A

The Court of Appeals in the District Court's

order was that it be 5 to 1.

13

Q

I understand.

16

A

The Court of Appeals put in substantially or

17

approximately 5 to 1.

13

Q

19

shifting, would it not?

20

A

And that would require some shifting, major
Of faculty in the school?

Oh, yes, Mr. Justice, that would be considerably

21

more than they had achieved so far and from the materials

22

referred to in the respondent's brief here it would appear that

23

they have made substantial progress towards that.

24

of course, is a long way from 3 to 2.

25

Five to one,,

It may be that the generality of the Court of Appeals'
16

1

opinion is no kindness to the School Board of Montgomery

2

County and its responsible employees»

3

of Appeals said early in its opinion at the outset we note

4

that the testimony of the school officials indicates a need

5

for specific directives in the instant case, and the court set

6

out some of that testimony.

The Panel of the Court

Before going further, I should point out that the

7

3

decision of the Court of Appeals was a 2 to 1 decision, with

9

Judge Thornberry dissenting.

The plaintiffs and the Government

10

filed a petition for rehearing en banc before the full Court

11

of Appeals.

12

and with an opinion supporting the rehearing by Chief Judge

13

Brown.

14
15
16
17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

That petition was denied by a vote of 6 to 6

It should also be noted that the modification of
the decree ordered by the Court of Appeals knocks out the
portions of the District Court9s order which were applicable
to substitute teachers, student teachers and night schools.
It should be noted that ct. the time Judge Johnson6 s
order was entered in February and March, 1968,, there had been
virtually no desegregation of substitute teachers and none of
student teachers or night schools and there wore no plans in
these areas.
Thus, it cannot be said that the respondents were
making progress on these matters.

They had not even started.

The brief for the respondents relies on the facts
17

1

also relied on by the majority in the panel below that Judge

2

Johnson several times complimented the respondents on their

3

efforts and their progress over the years from 1964 to 1968»

4
5

But this case can hardly be decided by recalling
compliments.
The record also shows that Judge Johnson in February

6
7

but it is in fact far short of the objectives of the District
Court's decree.

It may be that it complies with the require­

ments of the decree as modified by the panel of the Court of
Appeals, and this serves to illustrate the shortcomings of
that modification since the results achieved are so far short
of disestablishing desegregation in the respondent's school
system.

carry that mark that it was a white school or a black school.
The District Judge in such a case should have wide
latitude in formulating, structuring his decree in order to
bring about a result which is undeniably in accordance with law.
This is not a case where a judge has made a decree which
condones a failure to comply with the law; it is a case where
a District Judge in a case nearly four years old when he acted
set down a standard for action which would clearly comply with
the law as enunciated by this court.

slow pace of progress, and indeed such progress has occurred,
in Montgomery County has occurred in a background of pervasive
political opposition to desegregation throughout the State,
And the specificity of the District Court's order
should be read in the light of how useful an order like that
may be with that kind of a background,
I might refer to page 392 of the record in which
action of the State Superintendent of Education and of the
Governor in opposition to faculty desegregation is set forth
and that is in the opinion of Lee against Macon County which
is in the record here and which was affirmed by this court,
A sentence or two is Dr, Meadows, State Superintendent

constitutional officer of the State of Alabama and that the

And I skip a while and about the same time Attorney

below.

specificity of the order should be seen not only against the
background of whatever it was that motivated the local school
board but in a certain sense may be seen as a protective
device for a local school board which desires to comply with
an order.
Now as the Solicitor General stated, this case in­
volves two fundamental issues.

One is the question of the

standards by which District Courts should review desegregation
plans of school systems which have previously been segregated
21

1

pursuant to law, and as another aspect of that, more importantly

2

it involves the vitality of this court's decision last year

3

in Green against County School Board where this court held

4

that desegregation plans must xvcrk.

5

Two things should be stated clearly at the outset,

6

though they appear in the record and in the or.iefs and that is,

7

this case does not involve a hiring quota.

8

in which any fixed proportion of Negro or white teachers must

9

be employed by the system.

10

It is not a case

The standard of employment may be any objective

1!

standard and the standard of employment is sat forth in the

12

decree of the United States against Jeffersoa County, which

13

was entered in this case previously and which appears in the

14

records and the briefs.

15
16
17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

That is, that only that race may not be a standard
in employment.

The Jefferson standard incluied also that race

may be taken into account for the purpose of counteracting or
correcting the effect of the past segregated assignment of
teachers in the dual system.
And to that extent, I think anticipated the ruling
in the instant case.
The second thing I think of considerable importance
that should be noted is that the area of disagreement between
the Court of Appeals and the District Court is not one of
principle and not one of constitutionality but one of standards
22

1

and workability.

2

Judges Gewin and Elliott in the Court of Appeals

3

on page 766 assert that race may be taken into account for

4

purposes of counteracting or correcting the effects of racial

5

segregation in any dual school system as has been held previ­

G

ously in this court and elsewhere.
Their objection to the ruling of the trial court is

7
8

one that it is not workable, it is not. a sufficiently flexible

9

system.

On 763 they write "It is our conclusion that the

10

standards fixed by courts with respect to faculty desegregating

11

cannot be totally inflexible."

12

And as a consequence, what they did was they took

13

numerical ratios of substituting and the court order merely

14

doesn’t tell the trial court or the school board what to do„

15

It just tells them what not to do on 766.

16
17
10
19

20
21

22

23
24
25

Under the facts and circumstances of this case the
order will be modified accordingly and the numerical ratio as
set forth in the District Court and decree will be eliminated.
Now this court in Green said that a plan must work.
The District Judge, writing his opinion shortly before the
decision in the Green case anticipated in effect what this
court said in Green and he set down a workable standard by
which the District Court could work.

After all he has to be

able to measure whether or not there is compliance and by which
the school board can work.
23

1

As a substitute for that the Court of Appeals gives

2

us nothing and we would like to submit several reasons why we

3

believe the District Court was clearly correct.
First of all, as the Solicitor General pointed out,

4

5

the District Judge has lived with this case

for four years.

6

He knows the record, he knows the school system, he knows

7

the defendants, he knows their internal problems and the prob­

8

lems they have with regard to the rest of the State,
He found explicitly in his opinion that there were

9
10

no administrative difficulties either to his immediate goals or

11

to achieving his ultimate objective.
Secondly, the respondents in an appendix to their

12
13

brief set forth what they have done with respect to the interim

14

goals; that is the 1 to 5.

15
16
17

they demonstrate that when this school board is given a numerical
goal it knows how to abide by it and that a

20
21

Consequently, there is no reason to believe that
having been given 1 to 5 they can3t do more.

24
25

Numerical ratios

having been stricken from the District Court opinion by the
Court of Appeals no one knows what to do now,
Should they go to 2 to 5, 2-1/2 to 5, 3 to 5, it is

22
23

19

And if you look it those statistics

Thirdly, the Superintendent in charge of faculties

16

mean and this testimony of the School Superin rendent precisely

17

describes what the state of mind of the School Board has to be

18

in the present status.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

We have discussed

I do not have a definition of what that would

The Court of Appeals has put him back in a situation
which according to his own testimony he doesn't know what to do.
Nov; the numerical ratio of 60-40 or 3 to 2 is not
taken out of the blue.

On page 668 of the record we have

Judge Johnson speaking to the superintendent and suggesting
that perhaps a numerical ratio like that would be appropriate.
And he says ”Your student population," he was referring to
25

1

student population but he really must have meant faculty

2

because the student ratio was somewhat different, "Your student

3

population is 60-40?"

4

"Yes, sir.

5

"Ultimately that will be your optimam if you are

6

7

going to eliminate the ratio characteristics :>£ your school
through faculty?

8

"Nodded to indicate affirmative reply."

9

And so when this was suggested to the School Super­

10

intendent or the Assistant Superintendent in charge of faculty

11

as an acceptable ratio he acquiesced in it, so it is apparently

12

an agreeable way of going about it.

13

Finally, the notion of numerical ratio is one which

14

is entirely suitable for use by this Board; indeed, they have

15

said traditionally that numbers was what they were going to use.

16

On 656 of the record the Assistant Superintendent

17

says, "Well the way I will go about is first I will put one

18

in each school and then I will put two in each school and then

19

I will put three in

20
21

22
23
24
25

each school, and so on."

So numbers is not an uncongenial impossible \i?ay of
working it according to their own testimony.
And the Judge pointed out indeed in his opinion that
the formula which he proposed was little different from what
they were doing.

You will find that in the record on page 526.

Now the numerical ratio, as I pointad out, protects
26

1

the board in two senses.

It protects them because now they

2

know what to do.

3

is less likely they will be in violation.

4

also against depredations by State authorities.

5

other courts have found this type of approach useful.

It is less likely they will be contempt„
It protects them

And finally;,

In the Dowell case in Oklahoma City the Tenth Circuit

6
7

affirmed the use of precisely such a ratio and it might be

8

pointed out that it was initially suggested by a panel of

9

educators.

10

It is being used in other courts„ throughout the

country as cited in our brief.

11

Most importantly, however, the Court, of Appeals on

12

no record whatsoever substituted a vapid good faith standard

13

requirement for one which is resting on a solid record.
We submit to this court that the history of deseg­

14
15

1C
17

regation in the courts has been that specificity and immediacy
bring results and that generalities do not.

20

2!
22
23
24
25

And this is the

sense of the Green decision of this court of last year.
Since Green has been handed down, it has indeed been

10

19

It

working.

More important, its effect is pervasive beyond the

judicial system because its standards are being incorporated
as the standards of this court on other school desegregations
issues are incorporated into the guidlines of the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare.
And so it has an effect beyond the ordinary effect
of stare decisis.

We submit that the Court of Appeals’ decision
27

is a throwback»

it should be reversed»

There is no justification for it and that

Mr» Phelps

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
As the Solicitor General and Mr. Greenberg stated,
the issue is whether or not in public education we must have a
compulsory mathematical ratio in faculty assignment.

the court that we are not here and don’t take the position of

13

contesting full faculty desegregation.

faculty desegregation is indeed an important md integral part
in the overall desegregation process.
We do, however, strenuous 3.y object to the compulsory
mathematical ratio on the basis that we have outlined.

We

understand the responsibility of the Board to be to assign
people to schools throughout the system so that no school is
identifiable by its faculty as being tailored for either white
or Negro children.
Q

Has that been done?

A

It is in the process now, your Honor, of being

done, and we are making, we believe, sir, expensive numerical

progress as well as qualitative progress.

teacher that is well qualified for the job in a particular
school, and if that teacher is adapted and is qualified, that

in- a black or a white

school in a desegregated assignment will become looked upon as
a teacher, as a quality educator and not as either black or

That is true we think unidentifiability in the schools

We think, Mr. Justice, that quality placement

and we can get there if the court please, by quality, whereas
if we assign unqualified teachers either black or white in
desegregated assignments they will remain black or white
forever.

Well, a high school science taacher# Mr. Justice#

is certainly not qualified to teach an elementary child how
to read.
Q

11

12

You mean that some teachers aren’t qualified

to teach children of another race?

8
9

Well# that is true# they are qualified to teach

the subjects that they have trained --

6
7

I

And I doubt that a science teacher teaching in

the junior high school is capable of teaching kindergarten.
I assume so.
equally

I am talking about equally qualified teachers#

qualified grades, equally qualified subjects.
You say that some are qualified and some are not.

Now take seventh grade elementary school teachers.

What is

the difference in their qualifications?
A

If we had to meet a racial quota of 60-40 in

the elementary grades we would have to take some of the teacher
from the elementary grades and move them elsewhere in order
to get that quota or bring them into the elementary or junior
high grades from some other phase of our system.
The 60-40 overall doesn’t consider.

We have got

different ratios of white to blacks in high schools than we
do in junior high.

Different ratio of white to black in junior

Now if we had to make a racial quota

we would have to come along and take them out of elementary

He didn't say move them from seventh to high school.
A

Well, the Government and the plaintiff, if the

Court please, have asked for a random redistribution.

Now

randon redistribution to accomplish a 60-40 overall ratio
would have to be in each particular high school level, junior
high school level, elementary level.
They asked for a random redistribution and it just
cannot from the administrative standpoint work.
Q

I am not talking about what anybody said except

Judge Johnson.
A

All right, sir.

Q

He is worried with it.

Q

Why can't you shuffle your elementary teachers

as between white and black schools?

Why can't you shuffle

your junior high teachers as between the schools and the same
with the high school teachers?

25
37

A

'i

Now, for example, we have got different quotas

2

or different actual percentages in our various schools.

3

example, at junior high school it might well be we have got

4

70-30 instead of 60-40.

5

have more of one than would be able to be used in the 60-40,

and we would have to have something to do with those teachers.

We have got more latitude, of course,

if the court please than we would have in a 3 to 2 overall.
And I think this is significant to bring out at
this point.

This racial ratio requirement wasn*t asked for

in the plaintiff's or the Government’s motions before Judge
Johnson.
The first time that it came up was in the suggested

21

22

Where you have a 1 to 5 ratio you have got &

exhibits in our brief we are meeting a 1 to 5 approximately.

Therefore, the District

Court had no opportunity to look into these,, we say, impossible
effects.
Q

Well, does the record show, Mr. Phelps, does the

25
38

1

record show how many teachers there are in the various levels?

2

For example, does the record show how many teachers there are

3

in the elementary schools and the racial breakdown and in the

4

junior high in the racial breakdown?

5

A

Mr. Justice, I believe in order for the record

6

to show that, someone would have to be familiar with the

7

individual school.

8

Q

Well, does the record show that?

9

It does not?

Or doesn't it?

Is that what you are saying?

10

A

I don't believe, sir, that it does.

11

Q

Is it your point that in order to comply with

12

Judge Johnson's decree there would have to ba some shifting

13

of teachers as among the different levels?

14

A

Yes, sir.

15

Q

Say elementary teachers, for example, going to

16
17
18

20
21

22
23
24
25

junior high or high school teachers in elementary levels.

Is

that what you are telling us?
A

Yes, I am saying that that is the case and it is

going to be the case in varying degrees from year to year.
Q

Well, is there any proof of that in the record?

Is there any evidence in the record, or is there any factual
statement from which a judgment may be made as to the seriousness of that problem on a qualitative basis?
A

Yes, sir.

I believe that it is for this reason.
39

Certainly it

1

will appear from the record and the reports that have been

2

filed over the years that varying numbers of students will

3

attend varying schools each year»

4

Q

That is not v;hat I mean»

5

Tell me about the printed record before us.

6

h

I can't state to the court that it is specifi-

7

cally in the printed record because we had no way of knowing

that we were going to be faced with this ratio requirement

and it was not as I said a moment ago in either the plaintiff’s
nor the Government's motion for further relief and the first
time we were faced with a racial ratio requirement was in the
suggested order as made by the Government.
Q

Well, if Teacher Jones, a white person, is

teaching first year history in the high school, a white high
school, and Teacher Smith, a black person, is teaching the
same subject in the first year class in the black school, why
couldn't you just change those two teachers?
h

If it was just those two, Mr. Justice, involved,

yes, but if you have got a ratio requirement that you are
having to meet you have got to have 60-40 in your black school,
60 percent white and 40 percent black, you are going to have
to move more than just those two teachers and it is going to
get into a process of musical chairs of just shifting teachers
around as bodies and it just cannot be the best thing for
quality education.

We think this is a very far-reaching decree and

Well you have had just 15 years»

4

A

Well, I am going to get to the progress that

5

We say they are unwise, arbitrary and

we made in desegregation, if the court please»
In one year the Montgomery County Board of Education

in 1966-67 was the first year that pursuant to court order

we went into faculty desegregation.

you to do it?

Why

don't you go back to 954?
A

All right»

Well, I think that in any event, whether it is '54
or whether it is '64, we have 212 full time faculty members
teaching in minority assignments today; 111 blacks in 34 white
schools and 101 whites in 39 black schools, approximately on
a 1 to 5 ratio.
Q

Are those really very meaningful figures in

tying where teachers are teaching by the color of the student?
This is a question of faculty.
faculty and students.

It isn't a question of matching

It is a question of integrating or

desegregating the faculty, isn't it?
25

42

A

t

I think the Justice is right.

1 think what we

2

are striving for is regardless of whether it be a formally or

3

predominantly black or white school, we are striving toward

4

having the faculty in each school, regardless of racial or

5

nonracial composition as not being identifiable.
Q

6

Is there anything in this record which would

7

indicate what the distribution of the various grades is of

8

white and Negro teachers.

tl

between white and Negro faculties is substantially different
in the high schools than in the grade schools.

Is there

anything in the record that indicates that the distribution

A

I don't believe so,

We would have to take ---

Q

Is there anything that indicates that the

distribution is substantially different than 3 to 2 as between
the first grade <ind twelfth grade, for example, or between
the

ninth grade and the sixth grade?
A

Mr. Justice White, I can't say that specifically

that there is.
Q

Well, unless you can, unless you can I think you

are asking us to assume that the distributio i is different
in making the argument that you may have to distribute teachers,
redistribute teachers from high schools to grade schools or
from the sixth grade to the seventh grade.

23
24

I can see that if it just so happened that all the
teachers in the high schools in all the high schools were white

25
43

!

and all the teachers in all the grade schools were Negro, then

2

a requirement of 3 to 2 in each school would obviously require

3

some shifting between high school and grade school but I would

4

just like to know if there is anything really helpful in the

5

record.,
Q

In your Appendix, Mr. Phelps, on page

Yes.

9

Q

I think that would furnish the ingredients of

10

the information Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Fortas have

11

manifested an interest if we knew which of those schools were

12

high schools and which elementary schools.

13

and others are not.
For instance Bear and Catoma and Chilton and so on

14

are simply all we have is their name.

Some are identified

This is an example of an area that this court

had no opportunity to get into because neither the plaintiffs
nor the Government asked for a racial ratio ahead of this
hearing and we had no opportunity to prerent these factors to
the court.

—■*
Q

I know but one of your objections here — I

agree it is only one of them — is that it may require shifting
teachers into jobs for which they are not qualified.
A

That is right, sir.
44

I would suppose if that objection was as obvious

in the District Court when this provision was proposed as it

Well, I take it that Judge Johnson —■ I don't

see anything in here to indicate that he would expect you to
reassign high school teachers to grade school, for example.
I would suppose that he would, that his order on its face
requires that, I would in the first place be surprised and
in the second place I doubt if he would stick to that.
A

We think that mathematical ratios are dangerous

in public education and that is one of the examples and one
of the reasons we say we had no opportunity to go into this.
Another problem that we have in racial ratios in
fact is no one, the school board nor the court can control a
teacher in his or her employment.

The teacher can resign, go

to another school system, or go into another means of employ­
17

ment so here we have got a standard on the employment of
10

faculties that neither the school board nor the court has
19

anything to do about.
20

A teacher can resign if she wants to.

She can go

21

into another field of endeavor.

Unfortunately in the State of

22
Alabama we don’t have the financial resources to hold

a lot

23

out to them as far as money.

We have to treat them as pro­

24

fessional people.
25

46

In fact another point we think a drawback on a racial

1

2

ratio requirement is that you are tying the standard to

3t

something that neither the court nor the school board can

4

control,,
Another point that we bring out and we state shows

t
<<"

e

the lack of wisdom in such a proposal is a yardstick if it is

7

tied to the composition of the entire faculty will vary from

8

one school to another.
For example, in Birmingham, Alabama, there are 26

9
10

11
12

percent black and 74 percent white.

are 14 percent black, 86 percent white.

15
16

17
18

You have got a yardstick that varies from state to
state, from district to distirct and even within the various
school districts within a given state and as we pointed out
a minute ago it varies between your junior high and the
elementary even within the same school district and it varies
from year to year and we think that the yardstick is ——
Q

19

20

A

No, sir, and that is hopefully what all of the

schools are headed for as the Solicitor General pointed out.

23
24

But if you integrated all of the students in all

of the schools you wouldn’t have any of the problem.

21

On current statistics I think we have

said and we have got 212 full time classroom faculty teachers

that he was going to have in excess of 100 and he has worked

quality education when you assign teachers»
Q

Well, do you object — are you objecting up here

to compulsory reassignment?
A

No, sir.

Q

And you agree that compulsory assignment is as

a remedy matter that the school board has to be able to do that?
A

And the Fifth Circuit made that clear.

Q

Quite, I thought.

A

The court opinion emphatically said that you had

to compulsory assign but we say all right, but in this com­
pulsory assignment, let us take the qualifice.tion, the indi­
viduality of the teacher into consideration.
If you lose that, if the court please, and in public
education it is going to be at the expense of school children

21
22

throughout the nation regardless of race.
Q

Why should there be any difference between a

23

high school history teacher in a black school and a white
24

school so far as qualifications are concerned?
25

48

A

1

I don11 think there is but 1 think when you have

to assign a teacher on the basis of meeting a quota instead

of of assigning a

teacher on the basis of qualification and

at one school, you can't send her over or it wouldn’t be right
to send her over and teach biology in another school or by the
other side of it if a teacher has been teaching general science
in a white school it certainly wouldn’t be fair to the teacher
nor to the child to send her to a black school to teach
physics o
And those are all elements that have got to come into
faculty placement, so I say yes, sir, we don’t make a dis­
tinction between a white and a black teacher on the basis of
qualification but what the teacher is trained to do if it is
a science teacher and a science teacher changes from one
school to another to meet a quota but if that science teacher
had been in general science in a white school, it wouldn’t be
fair to the teacher nor to the children to tea.ch physics in
another school»
Q

Are your black teachers and your white teachers

respectively recruited from different universities?

Teacher

23

colleges or whatever they call them?
24

A

Not as much now as it has been,

25

49

I can’t say

i *

that all the vestiges of that are gone* but they are leaving,

; 2

that certainly is true to some extent.
Q

You have got a lot of people there who were

recruited in the past I assume.

A

Yes, sir, that is true.

S

Q

Most of the blacks were recruited from segregated

8

Yes, sir.

Q

And most of your whites were recruited from

segregated white colleges?

11
12

A

Yes, sir.

And would you say that the white colleges

generally had better facilities and better staff and so on?

I think it would be unrealistic not to say that

would be true.
Q

Mr. Phelps, do youhave the exact same books,

curricular, subject matter, equipment, in both schools?
A

I would say substantially so, yes.

Q

Well, what is the problem with transferring the

general science teacher in the predominantly white school to
the general science teacher in the Negro school since they
have everything exactly the same?
A

All right, sir.

23
24

In answer to Mr. Chief Justice Warren’s question, if
those were the only two teachers as I said, the only two ~—

2

Q

So I am starting with the general science teacher

6

same facilities, exact same books, exact same training, exact

7

same grade.

wouldn't be but if we have got a 3 to 2 ratio overall and we
have got to meet it in the high school -Q

18
19

Well, in mine I assume that in both schools since

:hey are all the same people, they all chose to take general

What about this though, sir, if the children at

one school had chosen to take physics and not the other, then

12

13

The general science

schools?

Wall is there that much difference between these

You seem to always find a problem here like there is

a difference in these schools.
A

Well, I say this to the court that mathematical

ratios are inherently problematical in public education and I
have tried to point up some of them.

There are many, many

more and I think Judge Skelley right in Hobson versus Hansen
recognized it when after discussing it.

25
51

i

Q

Do you think that case is on your side?

A

I think it is, Mr, Justice, insofar as --

3

Q

I am sure Judge Wright would be surprised»

4

A

After discussing Dowell and Kier, Justice Wright

5

said this — Judge Wright said there will be an abundance of

6

opportunity later for adversary argument on the merits and

7

demerits of the ends and means concerning teacher integration.

22

24

The whole school

system is a problem,

11

13

Well, there is a problem.

A

Yes, sir.

Q

But it tends to be to solve every problem but

A

Well, I think in the school system in Montgomery

race.

County, Alabama, we are striving to grope with the problem and
to solve it, and we state to the court that we will solve it,
that we will solve it in student desegregation and we will
solve it in faculty desegregation without the; imposition of
these compulsory mathematical ratios.
The Government in its brief and in argument has said
that this is only the mathematical ratio requirement is
remedial and not for perpetuity.

I suppose they are seeking

to make the distinction between a de facto and a school system
but when it comes to teacher I feil to see the distinction
between de facto and de jure.

Certainly it makes no difference

25

52

j
I

1

as far as the neighborhood as to what teachers are assigned to

2

what schools and I think that even more in a de facto situation

3

of what has been called de facto faculty integration is more

4

important.
We can't see either teachers are there or they are

5
6
7

not.

If they are not there, the scool is identifiable it is

patterned for one particular race or another we think the

8

problem exists whether you call it de facto or whether you it

9

de jure, the teachers are either there, it is either identi­

10

fiable as white or identifiable as black.
They say it is not for perpetuity.

11

13
14

15
16

17
18
19
20
21
22

The charge of

racial imbalance is made, continued to be made, if the charges
of a racial identifiability is made the petpetuity of the
ractial ratio requirement would exist just as long as these
charges

are made and we say that we are going about it in

Montgomery, Alabama, to provide nonracial identified faculty
in each school.
And we say that it is unwise, educationally unsound
and not consistent with quality education to have a mathematical
ratio and I have tried to explain but if we are doing it and
we are getting it done as the District Court noted in the
opinion that has been quoted from, Judge Johnson said that
you are doing as much without the racial ratio requirement or

23

that is what you tell us you do as the court is requiring you
24

to do anyway.
25
53

That is at the record page at 562.

1

What is actually

z

required of the court order is very little if any more than

3

the school board by its testimony is going to do anyway but

4

we plan to assign faculty so the schools are not identifiable

teachers according to bodies and not as to individuality.
Now we recognize that we must, foremost in our mind
keep the consideration of desegregating the faculty and we
state to the court that we are but we ask for the opportunity
to desegregate our faculties and do it consistently with

And the Court of Appeals emphatically

Why don't you just —■ why do you object then

of your objection to this decree that you are not permitted,
not permitted to make a judgment that this particular black
teacher or this particular black teacher will be unsuccessful
teaching students of the opposite race?

Is that part of it?

A

I would say that certainly that is part of it.

Q

How can you tell that?

A

Because, Judge, as I said overall and I tried

23
24

to point out specifically in an area of faculty placement if
teachers are assigned according to quotas, according to

25
58

percentages, it just inevitably is going to lose sight of the

You don't want to be — but you do want to be

some after the District Court order.
Q

I thought I read someplace in the record that

you no longer have any problem of replacing teachers-

It used

to be that you would have to have I don’t know how many, 70
or something like that every year but that now you don’t have
to do that because you have enough teachers that are staying
in the schools.
A

I think now, Mr. Justice, that the record shows

that it is probably a little less than 10 peccent faculty
turnover and that would be new ones coming in and I think the
surge is students is not the problem that it was some years ago.

Q

1

Mr. Phelps, in this question of assignment, do

2

you reason from the premise that any teacher who is qualified

to teach black students in this county is equally qualified

to teach white students?

A

To teach them the same thing, yes.

from that premise is it?

13

we say that the mathematical ratio requirement is unwarranted
because of our progress, because of the Court of Appeal’s
specific directive, the fact that desegregation must be
accomplished without delay.
We had affirmatively said you had to assign it

voluntarily where assignments didn't work.

We say that any

remedial writ has been handed down by the Court of Appeals
we say it is unconstitutional here, too, and we think it would
be based, no mathematical ratio has been required that we know
about that would require juries to mirror the original com­
position of a community.
No court has said that we know about that Government

I would say in answer to that, yes, your Honor.

One other objection I would like to say as far as

Your reasoning is

agencies have to hire according to racial ratios or that their
school children would have to be assigned according to racial

ratios.

In fact the Civil Rights Act of 1964 specifically

24

says that they shouldn't be assigned to eliminate racial

Our student teachers, there are 48 out of 262, 48
student teachers teaching in minority assignments, 24 white in
7 black schools and 24 black in 12 white schools.
There is 48 in 19 schools.
In substitute teachers, substitute teachers according
to the report filed on December 15, 1968, and according to a
letter we received from the District Court, those reports have
been sent up here, 701 days have been taught by minority
teachers as substitute teachers; 318 days taught by white
substitutes in 18 predominantly black schools; 300 days taught
by blacks in 30 predominantly white schools or 701 days in
desegregated assignments out of a total of 2516 in 48 schools.
Two schools in our system didn't have any substitute
teachers from September 15 to December 15.

present a terrific problem in that the teacher will call at

regated.

Faculty meetings have been completely desegregated.

Administrative councils where all were principals, adminis­
trative and staff people meet one week in a clack school and
the next, week in a white school.
We state to the court that progress that we made and
has been noted by the District Court and it vasn’t an empty
phrase when Judge Frank Johnson told the School Board in 1967
I believe or 1966, complimented the Board for operating a

2

As X started to say a moment ago* in September of

3

1967* four months before the order that we are here in court

4

about, Judge Johnson stated that, complimented the Board again

5

as pointed out by the Court of Appeals and said this from the

6

bench on September 5, 1967, "You are dealing here with a school

7

system that you haven’t had to take to your appellate court a

what they have done in good faith and they have been ahead of

We think that that again is evidence of our progress
and substantiates what we say we are going to do and addition­
ally when Judge Johnson complimented the Board and said that
he would recommend other school systems to emulate the conduct
of the Montgomery Board, that is not an empty phrase.
We say to the Court that we have made progress.
The remedial writ has been handed down by the Court of Appeals.
We say that we recognize and we are the first to recognize
that the ultimate objectives have been reached.

We say we are

working on it and we are in the process of accomplishing it.
We say that we will reach them for the purposes of desegregating
our school system in compliance with the Green case, with the
Bradley Case, with Rogers versus Powell but also consistently
with quality education for the best interest of white children

25

65

1

and black children alike.
Q

2

May I ask you, since you say you are going to

3

do that, what is your objection to Judge Johnson’s decree,

4

your particular objection?
A

5

The particular objection, Judge, is that we

6

have to have a ratio in faculty assignment and we say when

7

teachers are assigned to meet a ratio instead of to meet

8

quality education and instead of to remedy identifiableness of

9

a school that you lose quality education for whites and blacks

10

alike.
We say that racial quotas are inherently dangerous

11

12

in public education, that they are tied to --

13
14

15
16
17

22

A

No, sir, we are moving toward this?

We are

as either white or colored for the students going to that
school.

19

21

I understood that is what you are moving tov/ard.

moving toward the faculty in each school being not identifiable

18

20

Q

Q

How can you do that?

A

We can do that, Judge, the same way that we

have done in the last year by assigning blacks to white schools
consistent with quality education and blacks to white and whites
to black, not to meet a quota but to remove the identiyingness
of either white or black school insofar as the children are

23
24

concerned.
I have tried to go into the specific reasons that we

25
66

1

say specifically that the invocation of a compulsory ratio on

2

top of what we say we are going to do is unwarranted, it i,s

3

unnecessary, unconstitutional and it puts an unwise or detri­

4

mental burden on quality education.
Q

5
6

What school in the city of Montgomery do you

have colored teachers teaching the most white children?

Generally on the basis those are two examples.

Thesre

are some that may be more but generally on 1 out of 5 throughout
the system teaching across lines so in our schools where if it
is predominantly white student population,

approximately 1 out

of 5 of the teachers in that school are black teachers.
21

Does that answer the Judge's question?

23

A

I am just the attorney.

do state that we have discussed this with

4

this court are from the Board of Education of Montgomery County,

5

the same people that Judge Johnson said were running a school

system as professional educators and not as politicians.
Q

7

What has been your experience so far as you

8

understand it? Having these white pupils under the colored

9

teachers ih those schools?

JO

A

It has been

favorable.

11

Q

It has been

favorable?

12

A

Yes.

I think they tend to coiamunicate well and

13

I think a reason, Justice Black, that it has been favorable

14

is that we have made these assignments on considerations of

15

what the teacher has been teaching and what she was assigned to

16

and she is qualified for what she is doing and those white

17

children look to that black teacher not as a black or a white

10

but as a good teacher.

19

Q

You think you have moved that far in Montgomery?

20

A

I do, sir.

21

I think we are going to move

further.
