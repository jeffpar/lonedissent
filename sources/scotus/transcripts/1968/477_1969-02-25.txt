MR. LACOVARA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court,
This Internal Revenue Forfeiture Case is here on
writ of certiorari issued on the Government8s petition to
review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit holding that a claim with the privilege against selfincrimination under principles announced last term by this
Court in Marchefeti and Grosso decisions precludes forfeiture
of property used in violation of the Wagering Tax Act.

The factual background of the case can be stated

\
2

briefly,,

As a result of investigation by the Internal Revenue

3

Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into non-pari

4

mutue1 betting at Sportsman Park Race Track in Cicero, Illinois,

5

in the summer of 1963„
Federal agents, pursuant to a warrant arrested Donald

6
7

Angelina., the claimant in this case at Sportsman"s Park on

8

August 24, 1963.
When Mr. Angelini was taken to be booked it was found

9

that in his pockets he held $8,674, the Respondent money in

10
11

! this case.

Mr. Angelini was subsequently indicted and son.”

12

victed on two counts for violating the Wagering Tax Act and/or

13

he was sentenced to 60 days in prison and $2500 fine.
Over his objection that an application of the Act to

14

IS

him violated his privilege against self-incrimination, the

16

Seventh Circuit affirmed in October of 1S65 in this court denied
certiorari„

17

In the meantime, February 1964, the Government insti­

18

tuted this present proceeding, a libel in rem, against the

19

money that had been seised, from Mr. Angelini when he was

20

a. r res ted.

21

At the trial on this libel, the Government produced

22

approximately a. dosen Internal Revenue and Federal Bureau of

23

Investigation agents who testified their observations of non-par i

24

rautuel betting at Sportsman's Park and to Mr. Angelini's role

25

3
i!

V

in ito

2

It was also stipulated that although Mr, Angelini

3

had registered as a gambler for the fiscal years 1957 and 1958,

4

he had not applied for or obtained the $50 Wager and Occupations 1

S

Tax for the period covering August 1963,
The District Judge, jury trial not having been

6
7

demanded made findings of fact and conclusions of law in which

8

he agreed that an illicit wagering business had been conducted

9

at Sportsman's Park and that no person receiving wagers,
*

10

non-pari mufcuel wagers at the Park had paid the $50 occupational

1!

tax and he further found that the Respondent money in this case

12

had been used in the course of that violation of the Internal

13

Revenue laws.
Accordingly, under Section 7302 of the Internal

14
15

Revenue Code the money in this case was forfeited to the United

16-

States.
The Seventh Circuit affirmed, again over self­

17
18
19

20
21

22

incrimination objections and the case was pending here on writ
of certiorari when this court decided, Marchetfci and Grosso
last terra.
Shortly thereafter the petition was granted and the
case remanded to the Seventh Circuit for reconsideration in
(

23
24
25

light of Marchetti and Grosso.
On remand, the Seventh Circuit, without further
brifefing or argument, determined that the principles announced

4

1

by the Court did indeed apply to the forfeiture of property

2

used in violation of the Wagering Tax Act and it reversed the

3

decree of forfeiture because the Sixth Circuit subsequently

4

explicitly rejected the Seventh Circuit's ruling in this case

5

and held that the forfeiture provisions that are here in

6

question are remedial rather than penal, that the privilege

7

dees not constitute a substantive defense in this type of in rem

a

action.

9
10
11

The Government, therefore, petitioned for certiorari
to resolve the conflict among the Circuits.
Our position is that the critical difference between

12

a criminal proceeding such as the proceedings involved in

13

Marchetti and Grosso and an in rem forfeiture which is directed

54

both in form and in substance against depending property and is

15
16
17
IS

remedial rather than punitive serves to distinguish Grosso and
Marchetti and in spirit and letter of the Fifth Amendment from
proceedings like the present one.
Our contention is that the heart of the decision below

19

wherein lies critical error was the assertion by the Seventh

20

Circuit that the application of the general forfeiture statutes

21

22
23
24
25

in the Internal. Revenue Code, in circumstances like these, have
as their only purpose the punishment' of individuals for violation
of the Wagering Tax Act.
The Court said, "Since it is a practical matter,
Marchetti and Grosso establish that individuals cannot be
5

1

punished criminally for that sort of conduct; it follows that

2

they may not be punished indirectly by forfeiture.
While we would be prepared to reject the logic that

3
4

the indirect consequences intolerable simply because direct

5

criminal prosecution is also barred, we think the basic error

6

that the Court committed was in asserting without any discussion

7

whatsoever that the basic purpose,, the only purpose the Seventh

0

Circuit said of forfeitures like the present one is a penal

9

purpose o
On the contrary we submit a review of the historical

10
11

12
13
14

and legal aspects of Internal Revenue Forfeitures establishes
that they are not penal.

essence or in objective at punishing an individual for his
violation of the Internal Revenue Code.
They are not designed to penalize anyone for his

15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22

They are not directed either in

invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination.

Rather

we submit, they are remedial in the sense that they provide an
alternative for assuring an adequate flow of revenue into the
Treasury»
We say that historically this is true because this
court, relying on past English decisions, has consistently
differentiated Internal Revenue Forfeitures under the statutes
from the common-law type of forfeiture which attached directly

23
24

to an individual upon his criminal conviction, a felon’s goods
that common law would forfeit and all that the crown needed to

25

6

1

do to obtain his property was to demonstrate that he had been

2

convicted of a crime,,

3

On the contrary, this court itself carefully pointed

4

out in the Boyd decision on which the claimant principally

5

relies and on which the court below termed controlling. Internal

6

Revenue forfeitures which have dated in this country from the

7

First Revenue Act of 1789, are directed at a different purpose»

8

9

Their object is not criminal punishment as the Court
found in the particular forfeiture statute in Boyd was, but

10

merely at remedying a default upon the Treasury, a nonpayment

12

of a valid tax.,

12

13
14

25
16

28

1.9

We start in this case by assuming that the Court in
Marchetfci and Grosso did not hold that the Wagering Tax Act is
invalid in the sense that it does not impose civil liability
for the tax.
We think that this is a fair assumption because in
our view the Court went to great pains to point out that nothing
in the decision was to extinguish civil liability even in the
face of the privilege but was simply to preclude criminal.

punishment in the face of a proper invocation of the privilege.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Very well.

(Whereupon, at 2s30 p.m. the Court recessed, to
reconvene at 10 a,m. Wednesday, February 26, 1969.)
