ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELVYN 2ARR, ESQ.

Ho. 645, John Davis,

certiorari to consider whether the police conduct evidenced by
t his case contrary to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to

17
13
19
20

the Constitution of the United States .and.if so, whether the
product of that illegal police conduct, Petitioner's finger­
prints, was properly admitted into evidence at Petitioner's
trial.

21
Briefly the facts are these.
22
Starting December 3, 1965, the police of Meridian,
2.3
Mississippi, took into custody for investigation some 65 to 70
24
Negro boys.

Now what they were investigating was a complaint

25
2

1

of rape by an 86-year old white woman who had reported to the

2

police that she had bean attacked in her home by a Negro youth

3

on the evening of December 2nd, apparently around 7 o'clock.

4

The nature of her description is uncertain but its

5
6
?

8
9
10

11
12

quality can. be inferred from the number of suspects it appeared
to cover.
Two partial fingerprints had been found on the out­
side of a window and a partial palm print had been found on the
inside of the window sill.

On this basis the dragnet began.

Particular, a 14-year old Negro boy who had done yard
work for the woman was one of the 65 to 70 Negro boys taken
into custody.

Petitioner was taken to police headquarters on

December 3rd, questioned, fingerprinted and released.

The

13
14
15

,

others apparently went through a similar procedure.
Now it is quite clear from the record that there was
no warrant for petitioner's detention.

Why?

The reason is

16
best capsulized in Respondent’s brief at page 2 in these terms

17
and it is quoted that none of these 65 or 70 who ware interro18
gafcedor picked up were suspects but were only interrogated and
10
printed by the police in an effort to get leads to establish

2
probable cause to arrest the guilty party.
21
That is at page 2 of Respondent's brief.

22
Now at that December 3rd detention which was the

23
Petitioner's first detention, he was fingerprinted and those

24
sets 1 will show refer to as a first set.

25
3

They were never

Now between December 3rd and 7 th, he was taken into

Officer Keller testified that he

However,, there was apparently no

the petitioner had done some yard work for her as recently as

12

two weeks before.

were introduced into evidence, the second set was gained, began

On December 14th this second set was taken and sent
off to the FBI laboratory in Washington, together with the
prints of approximately 23 other Negro boys who were still
under suspicion at that time.
On December 14th, although the record does not show
it, he was charged with juvenile delinquency for breaking into
the woman's home.

Three days later his case was certified by

State — well, before I get to that, let me first say that
preliminarily Petitioner's counsel moved to suppress the intro­
duction evidence of the second set of fingerprints as violative
of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments,

After

a hearing his motion was denied.
The prosecution's case consisted of the woman's
testimony which is capsulised at pages 4 and 5 of our brief
to the effect that he had done yard work for her, a description
of the attack which is contained, set out in the brief, there
was no medical evidence.

The second set of fingerprints came

in over objection and he was convicted and sentenced to life
imp risonment,
Q

Why were the second set of fingerprints used

rather than the first?

A

Yes, we contend that there was, your Honor.

Q

I know you do but the facts are different,.

A

Well, your Honor, the only testimony as to this

first detention which we call an arrest, that of December 3rd,
was by Officer Griffin on page 6 and Officer Thompson on page
6 and 7, he was asked the question, "Did you have occasion on
December 3rd, last year, to arrest John Davis?"
"I did.

On page 8 the Police Chief Beddingfield testified near

the middle of the page that he went with the Petitioner to
Jackson on the 12th.

On page 10 Officer Kelfer testified near

the bottom of the page,
"Question:

Now when you picked him up, did you have

a warrant at that time for his arrest?
"Answer:

No."

A few lines previous to that his testimony was to the
effect that they in fact did pick him up on the 12th.

25

The

Mississippi Supreme Court held that on the 12th he was arrested»

2

Page 58 of the appendix, about ten lines down, it says, "Howeveil,

Let me beck up for one moment and discuss what the
Mississippi Supreme Court held»

One, that the detention yielding the prints was not

This apparently based on the mistaken assumption

10

that the prints had been taken as a result of the first

11

detention.

12

13

alternatively, theprints should not be excluded because they

14

are authentic.

15

Those that were introduced in evidence ware the

Now, Respondent argues and I better complete this

16

argument that even though, even assuming arguendo that the

17

prints, the second set of prints, are to be excludable as a

13

result of an illegal arrest, the conviction

19

affirmed, because on an assured retrial the first set which is

20

presumably lying around someplace hasn't been used, could be

21

introduced and, therefore, to reverse this conviction would

22

be a "useless gesture”.

23
24
25

must yet be

Quoting from the brief at page 8 to reverse this
conviction only to permit the first set of prints to be intro­
duced in evidence at John's retrial.

the contrary and large the court to set at rest the constitu­

That is right, your Honor, and I think that there

12

may be a narrow exception for true voluntary detention,

13

think that it is possible that one could conceive of a situation!

which a citizen actually voluntarily gave his prints in order

to eliminate any suspicion of himself.

have to apply.

give up his prints.

by the hospital, failure to identify positively in the hospital

Your Honor, the only testimony that I cited was

on page 51 of the appendix where the police juvenile officer

was an arrest the first detention was not.

And tvhy?

Well, both times that he was taken into custody,

13

but the difference the court below holds is that the first time

14

the police had no intention of charging the crime but merely

15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

wanted to investigate it.
|§ ■
There are two answers to this.

The first is that

th4re was no testimony about police intention as to December 3rd.
The only testimony as to the arrest of December 3rd is that
which I have quoted from earlier, pages 6 and 7 of the record,
by the arresting officers.
There is a sharper answer called for in this case.
The fact is this.

The fact that the officers had an investi-

gative intent only in taking him to the station December 3rd,
does not dispense with the constitutional requirements in
obtaining a warrant or under circumstances where a warrant may
14

be excused, showing a probable cause»
To the contrary, and this is our central point in
the case, to the contrary the fact that there was an investi­
gative intention only reinforces the illegality of the detention
reinforces the conclusion that there was a violation of
constitutional safeguards.
Because you can’t get a warrant under the law of the
land for an investigative arrest and you can’t show probable
cause or you can't take someone down to the station in order to
get probable cause to detain him further.
Q

Your argument is thiss

It is entirely based on

the Fourth Amendment aspect or the Fourteenth Amendment, isn’t
it?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

Entirely?

A

Entirely.

Q

Not at. all on the Fifth Amendment aspects nor

on generalized due process?
A

No, your Honor.

13

Therefore, to return to the thread of my argument the

14

failure to obtain a warrant or to make any attempt to show

15

probable cause for the two arrests is explainable by the fact

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

that this is just an investigation, an investigative arrest but
is not excusable.
Now, I turn to the warrant, point.

The record is

clear that there was no warrant for his arrest, both on the
3rd and 12th.

As I indicated the police can't get a warrant

under the law of the land for such an investigative attempt
so that we can understand why no warrant was obtained, even
though we cannot excuse it.
I see my time is running short so I will ——

It is only at the time and place when they were

taken he was under you say illegal arrest?
A

Yes, sir.

Our contention is grounded upon the

fact that it was illegal police conduct, outrageously illegal

police conduct and the fact that these fingerprints were the

z

product of this illegal police conduct means that if the

exclusionary rule means anything that these fingerprints should

be excluded.

Yes, but in the argument saying that if they

they take his fingerprints right there on thespot and turn him

loose.

10

A

You have to have a warrant for that.

11

Q

That is right.

12

So you do say that to taka

involuntary taking of fingerprints violates the Fourth Amendment?

13

A

Yes, sir, without a warrant.

14

Q

Without a warrant?

15

A

Yes, sir.

16

Q

Or without a legal arrest?

17

A

That is right unless there is one of these narrow

18

category cases that is really voluntary giving of fingerprints.

I know but I thought everybody wasinvoluntary.

that there

gated.
I tried him on the proposition to please the court
generalized statements from cases like Culombe versus
Connecticut, which was reversed for other reasons that this is
a general inquiry into an unsolved crime.
And often there is little else the police can do
than to interrogate suspects as an independent part of a
criminal investigation and to further quote from the opinion
and probable the most restricted case this court has ever
handed down on a criminal investigation, Miranda, general on -the scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime.
I wish to emphasize this language, or other general
questioning of citizens in the fact-finding process is not
affected by a holding.

And further, that fingerprints for all

the different categories, testimony levels, is held in Schmerber

13

But suffice to say, our State Supreme Court went along
with my argument that this boy, and incidentally he was only

My answer, sir, is this:

He was in restraint,

but not under arrest in the legal sense of the word.
