ARGUMENT OF NATHAN GREENBERG, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

10

MR. GREENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court.
My name is Nathan Greenberg.

I am an attorney from

11

Gretna, Louisiana.

12

Philip Cardinale, Jr., who was the petitioner in this

13

honorable Court for a petition for Writ of Certiorari.

14

I represent the defendant in this case,

The petitioner was convicted of the crime of murder

15

in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana and he was sentenced to death.

16

For his appeal we originally perfected some 14 bills of

17

exceptions v?hich we took to the Supreme Court of Louisiana and

18

we are here before Your Honors today on what would probably

19

amount to two of the bills of exceptions which had been combined'

20

together in one.

21

The crux of the issues before Your Honors today is

22

the effect of testimony relative to prior offenses of the

23

accused where the accused has not taken stand in his behalf

24

and where actually we submit that the use of the prior convic­

25

tion in this case was to show nothing more than a disposition

2

to commit crime, which we submit would violate the due process
clause of the 14th Amendment.

\

The way this developed in this matter was like this:
The accused turned himself in in Tuscon, Arizona and while he
was in custody, he was interrogated by the police there.
was pre-Miranda and subsequent Escabito.

This

So the Escabito rule

applies.
During the course of his custodial interrogation,
the petitioner volunteered that he had previously been
convicted of an offense in Louisiana which offense was actually
a crime against nature.

After he served his time in the Orleans

Parish prison that he went looking for the girl who had charged
him with this crime,

according to him, allegedly with a gun

for the purpose of killing her.
.* i

Now, he did not find the girl, he did not commit
any offense in connection with it and his statements relative
to the prior offense ware generally that — I'll see if I can
read it —r during the course of his custodial interrogation in
Tuscon, Arizona ha referred to a prior conviction occurring in
Louisiana which prior conviction was for a crime against nature
occurring on July 12, 1963 and causing the petitioner to be
sentenced to serve three months in the Parish prison on March 25,
1964.
Petitioner stated during the course of his custodial
interrogation that after he served his time in the Orleans
3

1

Parish prison, he went looking for his alleged prosecutrix

2

with a gun with a stated purpose of killing her.

3

never did find here and, therefore, no further offense was

■

However, he

i
J

4

j

committed0

5

Now, in essence, what we have here is a situation

6

where this reference to the prior offense served absolutely

7

no useful purpose, we respectfully submit»

8

this thing could possibly serve, we submit, is to try to

9

prejudice the 'jury, to show the jury, that this defendant is

10

The only purpose

a bad man»
This, of course, is why we are here before Your

11
12

Honors today»

13

could very easily have been separated from the remainder of

14

the statements of the accused.

15

been excluded, notwithstanding the fact that we sought to

IS

exclude it from the time it first came up — came up in the

17

opening statement, came up in the interrogation of the police

18

officer, came up in the closing argument by the District

19

Attorney„

20

Because here we had a situation where this

This could very easily have

Notwithstanding the fact, that we sought to exclude

21

it at each level of the proceedings, or each stage of the pro­

22

ceedings it was admitted and it was repeatedly referred to in

23

the closing argument.

24

Q

25

Did you seek to exclude it on the basis of the

United States Constitution?
4

\

A

In the District Court,, if Your Honor please,

this trial occurred in May of 1966„

This was prior to the

ruling of Your Honors in the Spencer case- and of course we
picked up the language of the Spencer case which I believe was
in 1967 as a basis of relying upon the -application for the Writ
to this Court»
The wording of the dissenting opinion by Mr. Chief
Justice Warren ■--Q

I think you understand my question.

A

Yes, sir.

Q

I am wondering if you

raised any

timely raised or when you

Federal question in this case.

A

Upon the application

Q

Of Certiorari in this

A

Yes.

for the Writ.
Court?

In the trial court what had happened was that the
State sought to justify the admissibility of the conviction on
a basis of propensity or pattern and of course we argue to the
Court at this time that there was no pattern because the prior
offense was crime against nature and this of course was murder
and of course the only reference to the alleged looking for
the prosecutrix with a gun and so forth related to an incomplete
offense»
We did not succeed in this respect.

The State then

came in and sought to justify the admissibility of the testimony

5

1

on the theory that this was a part of the entire confession and

z

that the entire confession as a whole must go in, that Louisiana

3

has such a statute requiring this, that the entire confession

4

go in and since this defendant said this,regardless of what it

5

was,it must go into evidence»
Of course we respectfully submit that this should not

6
7

be so.

For example, suppose the defendant made a statement

3

reflecting upon character or integrity of jurors, for example.

9

Should this go in because it is part, of an alleged confession.

10

Should the prosecution be entitled to use this as an

11

attempt to prejudice the jury against the defendant.

12

respectfully submit that the issue in this case is quite

13

simple.

14

convictions should be allowed to go in on behalf of the

15

prosecution?

m
17

We

The issue is, to what extent the evidence of prior

Q

Was the Federal question which yois raise here

decided at all in the lower court?

18

A

No, sir, it was not.

19

Q

So there has been no State decision on any

20

Federal question?

21

A

That is correct.

22

Q

Where did we get jurisdiction to hear the case?

23

A

Because of the contention that the Constitution

24

was violated with reference to the admissibility of the

25

evidence per se.

In other words, the Louisiana Supreme Court
6

1

2.

held that the confession must be considered as a whole.
Q

|j

Mien a case comes here from a State court does

3

not jurisdiction depend upon the State court having decided

4

the Federal question?

5

A

The Federal question, if Your Honor please, in

6

connection with this matter was not raised in the State court

7

for the reason that in the trial court there was no expression

8

which actually hit this on the button as it did on the dissent­

9

ing opinion in the Spencer case which came after this trial in

10
11

the State court.
Q

When you come to a State Supreme Court the error

12

was not assigned and the bill of exceptions is a Constitutional

13

error, wasn’t it?

14

A

No, sir,

15

Q

And the State court opinion does not treat it

16

it was not.

We originally --

on the ground of Constitutional error, do they?

17

No, sir, it did not.

Q

Do you have

any authority to the effect that

we have jurisdiction in such a situation?
A

Well, if Your Honor please, the issue which

we raise herein is one which really developed since the trial
of this case.

This case was concluded, I believe, on May 5,

1966 and the issue which was raised was actually pinpointed
in Your Honors9 decision of the Spencer case which was decided
by this honorable Court in 1967.
Insofar as the focusing of attention of this issue
was concerned,at that time the bills of exceptions had already
been signed, the appeal had been lodged in the State Supreme
Court and there
at that time.

was no way in which the issue could be raised
For the very simple reason that under the

State practice and procedure we have to raise the bills of
exceptions, the basis of the objections

to the admissibility^-

of the evidence, have them signed oy the Court and "then we

!

take the appeal.
So there was really, we submit, no way in which we
could raise the issue at that time because the matter had alreac
been tried, submitted and the trial court had lost jurisdiction,
Q

Do you take any comfort out of the opinion of

the Court in the Spencer case?
10

y

A

Yes, sir? we do.

This is the entire basis for

z

the application for the Writ.

3

the opinion in the Spencer case both majority and dissent would

4

fully indicate that the position of the defense in this case

We respectfully submit that

I

5

was correct# that it would be ■violative of the due process

0

clause.
In the Spencer case# in the majority opinion# the

7
8

majority stated:

"Petitioners do not appear to be arguing that I

©

the Constitution is infringed if a jury is told of a defendant's

10

prior crimes".

in this particular case.

and what# in essence# has occurred here is that the prosecution
said# "Well# since you# Mr. Defendant# made this statement
during the course of this confession we are entitled to bring
it into evidence."
Q

What do you get out of the sentence that you

just read from the majority opinion to help you?

The Spencer case was a habitual

23

And this# of course# is exactly what happened

open.

We submit that this actually leaves our question

And as was pointed out in the dissent, it leaves the
11

question open here as was stated in the dissenting opinion»

1

While this Court has never held that the use of

2
3

prior convictions to show nothing more than a disposition to

4

commit crime would violate the due process clause of the 14th

5

Amendment* our decisions exercising supervisory power over

S

criminal trials in Federal courts as well as decisions by

1

Courts of Appeal and of State courts suggest that evidence

8

of prior-crimes introduced for no purpose other than to show

9

criminal disposition would violate the due process clause.,

10

This* of course* is exactly the situation ~r~~:

11

Q

But is that applicable here»

1 know the State —

12

I think I recall that the State Supreme Court did not rely on

13

this point but isn’t it a fact that this prior conviction was

14

part of the story as to the motive* the alleged motive, for

15

the petitioner’s killing this woman?

16

A

17

of pattern»

18

Q

Well* Your Honor is talking about the propensity

No* I am not either.

I am talking about motive»

Didn't the State allege that the reason that this petitioner

19
20

killed this woman was that she had been the prosecutrix in the

2,1

prior conviction?

'

22
23

A

Yes* sir,

Q

Now, how could the State have proved motive —

24

am 1 right* too* that the State Supreme Court does not rely

25

upon that?
12

A

This was a different woman.

Q

This was a different

A

Yes, absolutely.

woman?

Q

It was a different State» wasn’t it?

A

Eof same State.

Q

Same State?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

But he was convicted for killing a different

woman than the onethat he had this alleged motive for killing?
A

Yes, sir.

In other words, we were placed in a rather anomalous
position here where the basis of our application here really
occurred while this thing was pending, if Your Honor please,
and we have a situation where I must admit in all fairness to
the Court that the direct matter raised here today was not
submitted to either the trial court or to the Louisiana Supreme
Court,
However, in our research we discovered the basis
of our coming up here on a Federal question subsequent to the
trial, subsequent to the time that the bills of exceptions had
been perfected and of course subsequent to the time that the
brief had been prepared in the Louisiana Supreme Court.
Q

But you still don’t have any authority for this?

A

We don't have any authority to come before

Your Honor'and say, "I know that I can point to such and such
13

3

a decision" arid say that this is the basis of it.

Q

2

No, no,

I mean you don’t have any authority

A

Well, in the event our rights of appeal would

M

be terminated because vj@ came up here in a normal course of

18

the appellate review then of course we would have to resort to

19

habeas corpus in the Federal Court system to present the issue.

20

In other words it would be just like a situation

21

where subsequent to Miranda, for example, a defendant -was tried

22

and didn’t have adequate counsel and then he came in and

23

24
25

sought to review it by way of habeas corpus in the Federal
Court system.
Q

Does the Louisiana statute that your Court reliec

on, do you find that sort of a statute in other States?

The statute in connection with the entirety of

A

We have not researched this from the standpoint

of other States, but my recollection is that there are some that

have a similar statute.

However, insofar as the law of crime is concerned

In the civil law area?

Q

That is interesting.

You are sure about that,

A

Oh, yes, absolutely.

Our civil law is based

are you?

upon the Code of Napoleon which in turn is based upon the
Code of Justinian.

Hoivever, in the 1 ax-7 of crimes our law is

taken directly from the common lav;., • It is, of course, codified
by statute today.

We respectfully request the indulgence of the Court

10

However, we felt that inasmuch as the time for

11

12

appeal had not yet run

13

presented itself for this case to run the gamut through the

14

course of the appellate review that we should ask for the

15

application

18

course we realise that we did not raise this -Constitutional

17

issue in the District Court or in the Supreme Court but the

18

issue is, nevertheless, existent, one which we submit should

19

warrant

of the Writ of Certiorari,which we did.

hnd of

Your Honors' attention to the matter.
We

20

and inasmuch as the opportunity still

submit it is a matter of prime importance.

It

21

is a matter which had a great effect in connection with prose­

22

cution of criminal cases, not only in Louisiana, but in other

23

jurisdictions.

24

What is the effect of prior

offenses where the

.

25

defendant has not taken the stand, has not put the issue of

16

his character or his reputation at evidence, and in the course
of the confession the defendant referred to the prior offense
and then the prosecution brings this out as a part of the
I

confession as a whole.
We submit that the evidence which was taken in this
case would warrant Your Honors' taking cognisance of the matter
and reversing it,
Q

X suppose the purpose of the statute that requires
I
that if any part of the confession is offered by the prosecution1
then the entirety must be offered is at least partly to protect
the defendant in the case, wasn't it?
A

Well, there isn't any doubt in my mind that

this was the intent of the statute,

As a matter of fact we

had cited the statute in the brief and of course here one
phrase of the statute is used against us and this is the
statute;

"Every confession, admission or declaration sought

to be used against anyone must be used in its entirety so that
the person to be affected thereby may have the benefit of any
exculpation or exclamation that the whole statement may afford."
So actually the exculpatary proviso of the statute

i

is one which really requires the utilization of the confession
as a whole and

here the confession as a whole was being used

to show that the defendant is a bad man.
Q

Was this a written confession?

A

No, sir, it was not.

It was as^ oral confession. ,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

ARGUMENT OF PRESTON H. HUFFT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

PJ
22
23
24
25

Mr. Hufft.

MR. HUFFT:

If Your Honor please, I represent the

State in this matter.
Before starting here I i-rould like to point out just
one brief comment with respect to Spencer.
20

Spencer was

1

z

,

decided on January 23

1967.

We argues this case before the Supreme Court of

3

Lousiana in December of ‘67 and the; opinion was handed down

4

on January 15, 1968, almost a year after Spencer.

5

Now just to review

6

Q

Spencer was not relied on?

7

A

Spencer was not relied on.

The only Constitutional

8

issues raised, Federal questions raised in the State proceedings

9

was one on the question of the search warrant for the evidence

10

and this Supreme Court had just decided the Warden case which

11

was in point and the State Supreme Court used it and disposed

12

of the question of the search warrant.

13

He also raised the question with respect to Miranda

14

and this case was instituted prior to Miranda and the Supreme

15

Court of our State made note of the fact that the Johnson case

16

would apply since we had started beforehand, and also took

17

special note that even if this case had started after Miranda

18

this case met the test of Miranda.

19
20

In order to really picture it let me just go into the
facts so we can see exactly what we are dealing with here.

21

Q

There was also a Schmirber point, wasn't there?

22

A

Sir?

23

Q

A Schmirber point.

24

Your Supreme Court relied

on Schmirber and California.
I

25

A

They did cite it in their opinion.

21

1

Q

That had to do with hair and blood of the victim?

2

A

Y@s, sir, and the Warden case came in and

3

we decided on the Warden case to eliminate all questions.

4

was oneof the cases cited but Warden case was used because they

5

objected to the fact that we issued search warrants in order

6

to search for evidence and we raised Gulard case and the Warden

7

case came out directly on point.

8
9
10

That

We had no trouble whatsoever, at least our State
Court didn’t, in disposing of that question.
Wow these are the fact of the case.

This man lived

11

in Marrero, Louisiana which is

12

Waw Orleans-.

13

This man lived across the river from Jefferson Parish.

14

went into the downtown area of New Orleans, picked up this

15

girl in a bar, had ~ this is the victim X am talking about now

16

had several drinks with her, went from place to place.

17

right across the river from

Plaquemines Parish adjoins Jefferson Parish.
He

During the course of the night one witness identified

13

that the defendant had stopped in for gas and had sped off and

13

he heard the scream of a woman in the car, that help her out

20

that she was being held in the trunk.

21

The defendant admits being at the scene.

He admits

22

having blood on his hands and his car, his clothes, the scene

23

in which we found the. victim.

24

finally fled the State of Louisiana and we issued a warrant

He rode around town that night,

25
22

for his arrest based on the information of the people who had s^fen
them together at the bars and the nightclubs, the service
attendant who recognised him, recognized his car and so forth
and so on
He fled to the State of Arizona, in Tuscon,

One

night while he was walking down the street in Tuscon he flagged
two policemen and said, "Take me in, I have committed a crime”.
They said,

"Well, wait a minute. Let us give you your rights,"
They give him his rights under Escofoito, the fact

that you don't have to say anything, and if you say it, it can
be used against you and you have a right to contact your
attorney.
They took the rnan in.
he was charged with.

The police didn't know what

The police had difficulty trying to

verify the charge because the man said that he had committed
a crime in Orleans Parish, where, not known to him, he had
just crossed the line and murdered the girl in Plaquemines
Parish.

So the police in Tuscon didn't have the opportunity to

check his story to see why he was wanted.
Now, in Tuscon, talking to these policemen, they said
he was very relaxed.
off of his chest.

Here was a man who wanted to get something

Here is a man who flagged the policemen

down, a man who wanted to talk about something that had
occurred.

\

He talked to policemen who knew nothing about it.

23

1

Our courts, in the State Supreme Court, ruled that the Johnson

2

case was applicable where they said even over and above the

3

Johnson case they felt this confession mat that comment in the

4

Miranda case that you don't have to stop a man when he walks

3

into the police and flags them down and wants to get something

6

off of his chest.

7

In this Writ there is no issue raised, whatsoever,

8

as to the voluntary nature of this confession and this .confes­

9

sion meets all the tests of being voluntary.

The only issue the t

10

arises is the following testimony in which this police officer

1!

from Tuscon gave the defendant's confession, included in that

12

confession was this comment and I will read it to the Court.

13

This is the police officer talking.

14

Q

Where are you in the appendix, what page?

15

A

I am not in the appendix.

16

This is on Page 5

of ray brief, sir.

17

Q

18

A

I see, thank you.
"Yes, he did.

He told me that several months

19

prior to this taking place, he picked up a woman whom he

20

described as a prostitute downtown in New Orleans" -■—

21
22
23

Q

What was the preceding question that prompted

that answer?
A

They asked him whether or not — let me put

24

it this way.

During this course of his relating the confession

25

when the police officer arrived at the point in which he was
24

then going to relate this comment relative to the previous
incident the

defense objected and there is a long protracted

argument and after the Court had ruled that this was admissible
on the basis that it was part of the confession under the
State statute',that the confession had to be used in its entirety,
and this was admissible, so this picks up right after the
argument and the decision of the trial judge that that question
was admissible,
Q

Was there a specific question in the direct

examination that called for
A

the prior crime?

It is raised that earlier in the preliminary

statement in order to introduce the confession it had beer;
mentioned in the preliminary statement and an argument had
ensued on that basis.

This statement had been mentioned when

the judge took under the question whether or not the question
was voluntary and this comes now for the first time that
the jury has heard this actual testimony and 1 would imagine,
sir, that it was in the form of a question knowing the stopping
so as to make 'certain that all of the arguments 'are presented,
thereto.
Q

Why did you need that?

A

We did this, sir.

In the introduction of this

evidence we went on a two-pronged attack insofar as the intro­
duction ,
No, 1, we said under the State statute, Title 15-450,

25

1

it says that if you use a confession# the confession must

z

he used in its entirety»
Q

3
4

Do you agree with attorney for the petitioner

that that is for the protection of the defendant?
A

3

Well# I say this# sir,

This is a

State statute

0

which does not give the District Attorney any discretion for

7

him to say what he shall put in and what he shall not put in.

3

This is meant'for the protection of the defendant# yes# sir,

9

Q

Well, couldn't he waive that protection?

10

A

There is no provision to waive that protection,

11

Q

Well# didn't he object?

12

A

He objected# yes# sir,

13

Q

Well# was that as far as he could go toward

14

waiving it?
A

15

13
17
18
19

20
21
22
23
24
25

sir.

As far as he-could go toward waiving it# yes,

But the State statute —
Q

My final question is# did it help him?

A

The objection?

Q

Mo,

A

No# sir.

Q

Did this testimony help the defendant?

So# you weren't helping him# were you?

A

No, sir.

What I am trying

Q

You were giving the jury the theory that this

man was the type of man who went around murdering women?
A

No# sir.

1 say this ---

26

1

Q

Isn’t that what you'did?

2

A

Well, Mr,, Justice, I will say this:

We had

3

two bases upon which we said this testimony was admissible»

4

They were very strong then and are vary strong now„

5

testimony was admissible because the law said in the State

6

of Louisiana that to use a confession you have got to use a

7

confession in its entirety.
Secondly, we argued very strenuously, and still do

8
0
10

This

here, that this testimony was appropriate, was admissible,
because it

tended to show motive and intent.

11

This is one of those instances

12

Q

That he made a business of murdering women?

13

A

When you look at the circumstances

14

Q

Is that the impression you were giving the

A

1 am going to give the circumstances, sir, in

15
16

jury?

17

which he says exactly what took place in the prior incident,

18

what took place in the crime with which we charged him, was an

19

identical incident.

20

that someone would complain against him and use his very words,

21

I am going to read, would take a gun and kill that person for

22

having complained against him.

We are showing that this man on the basis

We say that is essential.

23

Q

But you are not relying on the statute.

24

A

Sir, we have two bases.

25

and we also say it is admissible.
27

We said we had to, do it

1

Q

I see»

2

A

Now, this is the man's statement, if I can

3

get back to it.

4

"Yes, he did»

He told me that several months prior

5

to this taking place, he picked up a woman whom he described

6

as a prostitute downtown in New Orleans and that after having

?

several drinks together, they had intercourse and then in his

8

statement, in his own words, 'She went down on me o'

9

then, after an argument that she slapped him and he backhanded

He said

10

her.»

11

against him for backhanding her and that he received a sentence

32

of 90 days of which he did 45 days»

13

after getting out of jail from doing the 45 days that he went

14

out and got a gun and looked for two or three nights for her

15

downtown in the area where he had first seen her with the

16

intention of killing her because she had signed a complaint

17

against him."

18

Then he said that a while later she signed a complaint

He said that immediately

In the present case the facts are almost identical.'

19

We have no witnesses to say what really happened in that

20

automobile because this victim we have wasn't quite as fortunate

21

as the first woman, he didn't find her.

22

the second question was murdered.

23

The victim we have in

Now, this is the entire statement, that what I have

24

just read is the entire statement that the jury heard with

25

reference to this.
28

We say that under our statute we had no alternative,

1

2

we had to produce the statement in its entirety.

3

way the lower court ruled.

4

of Louisiana ruled in a long line of decisions.
Q

5

That is the

That is the way the Supreme Court

May I ask you as a matter of fact in Louisiana

8

where you have a man under interrogation for hours — this

7

happens in all States -- do you, in presenting your case to the

8

jury, relate everything that happened during those hours.

B

A

Yes, sir, I would, sir, for this reason ---

10

Q

I am not asking you what you would do,

11

I am

asking you if this is the practice?
A

12

In our area, yes, for this reason:

The statute

13

was intended that this man would have the benefit of having

14

the jury hear his confession in the same way he gave it.

15

what I may consider to be irrelevant a juror may attach a
1

18

certain weight to.
One of the reasons for putting this statute in was

17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Now,

not to give me, as a prosecutor, the opportunity to determine
what I should withhold, what I should keep in the background,
or have as a confidence between the defense and myself.

You

have got to tell the jury everything, just like the man told
it to you.

You have got to relate all the incidents and let

the jury draw their own conclusions with respect to this
individual's confession.
Q

Can you take the confession by questioning the

man's life and get all of the sordid things which might have
occurred in his life and then attach that to the confession
and introduce it?
A
case.

Mr. Chief Justice, this is not that kind of a

This is a case in Tuscon where the man walked in and

they had no background on the man whatsoever, no opportunity
whatsoever to --Q

Well, this is background, this is background

A

This is something the man volunteered, came

out with of his own free will, talking to people who had no
opportunity, even searchback, to determine even what they
were considering.
It is an entirely different situation and that
question did not arise in this particular instance.
Now, we say this information was essential over and
above the statute,

We contend

in our brief that he has no

comfort whatsoever in it.
Q

Would you make a distinction between the

application of a Louisiana statute to a written confession and
to this kind of situation — thatis to say what happened here
is that the petitioner talked to the police in Tuscon and I
suppose he told them a lot of things.
Now, would you make a distinction between — and
then the police officer took the stand in Louisiana and
testified.
30

s

A

Correct.

Q

Now, is there a distinction in the application

of the Louisiana statute between that kind of a situation and
a written confession with respect to what is appropriate and
what is not appropriate?
A

No, sir.

Q

A matter of common sense would seem that maybe

you could make such a distinction.
A

There is no distinction made in the jurisprudence

of the State.
Q

I notice here that actually the statement about

the previous offense and his relationship with this other
woman as appears on Page 509 of the typed transcript that that
was elicitive by the police officer, the Tuscon police officer,
by a question of the prosecuting attorney.
A

As I said before, if Your Honor please, if

given the background, when this was mentioned there was
considerable argument as to whether or not this police officer
could state this part of the confession.
When the confession was'heard by the trial, jucfge as
to whether ornot it was voluntary argument ensued on this
particular point.

When the thing was finally presented to

the jury, the trial judge had ruled.
It went on into the confession and then came this
Court and it same at this point with the question

31

where it

?

was stopped on the basis that defendant again raised their

2

objection when it was being presented to the jury.

19

Now,

Q

Well, the theory behind this particular statute
It is the fact that they don't give me, as a

i understand that.

I understand that.

But

on the other hand the question is whether that statute has
a different implication with respect to a written confession
and with respect to what the policeman says.

Would you take

the position that everything, everything, that the defendant
told the police officer in Tiiscon is, not only admissible, but
has to be received in evidence?

32

[

1

A

Correct^ —

2

Q

Because everything he said is part of the

3

confession whether properly relates to this crime or not.

4
5

A

Correct, sir,

that is what the statute says

Q

Well, then, that is impossible.

and that

6

I suppose that

7

this would be impossible for the police officer to do that and

©

maybe if they taped every word that the defendant said that

9

they could do it.
A

10

He doesn't have to say every word.

But, of

11

course, he does have to give the substance under the juris­

12

prudence but he cannot leave out items such as that, that he

13

figures to be irrelevant under the State's statute.
Q

14
15
15

17
18

No, but as I read this statute, what it says

is that it has to be

a confession, an admission o-r a declara­

tion and it has to be something that the prosecutor intends to
use.

I gather your Supreme Court has said here, in any event,

that this was — I don't know whether it was a'confession,

IS

declaration or admission — but in any event it came within

20

the four corners of the statute.

21

22
23
2,4
25

A

Correct, sir.

Q

That is what your

A

Yes, sir.

Q

Court has said.

I suppose we are concluded by that as far as

this testimony of the Tuscon officers are concerned, aren't
33

we?
Yes, sir»
Q

Can 1 ask you a question?

Does your State

Courts consider this under the common law rules of evidence
as applied —A

Our State Courts, if Your Honor please, consider

it under Title 15«

This statute ---—

Q

Just the statute,

A

Also we have two other statutes which were

mentioned with respect to the admissibility of previous
offenses when they intended to

show motive, knowledge and

so forth-- Q
A

But did the ——
—— within the traditional cases that this

Court has recognized,
Q

But did the Courts consider it under that?

A

No, sir, it had to come in on the basis that

it is part of the confession and our State Supreme Court did
not.
We brought both issues but the State Supreme Court
said of one issue: "This is determinative", and didn't reach
the other question.

But we raised them both times, we argued

both of them here on the very same basis.
Quickly winding up, also on the question of Spencer,

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF PRESTON H. HUFFT, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

6

.

MR. HUFFT: At the recess I was reviewing the fact that
\

7

it is the State's position that the Spencer case applicable in

8

this instance would uphold the statutes of the State of Louisian

9

I refer to this particular language in the statute

10

that it would be fully unjustified encroachment by this Court

11

upon the Constitutional powers of the State to promulgate their

12

own rules of evidence,to try their own State created crimes

13

in their own State courts.

14

I also point out that the Burgett case which this

15

Court decided after the Spencer decision found that there

16

was a specific Federal Constitutional right involved.

17

question of this defendant had been denied the right of counsel

13

in one of h.is State prosecutions and this Court was not going

19

to allow error to be piled on top of error and allow him to be

20

denied a second time.

21

The

And rightfully so in the Burgett case.

We also take the position that even under the

22

minority decision in the Spencer case that this evidence which

23

we introduced meets the test that this Court was talking

24

in all of its decisions.

25

under the State law in which this man was being prosecuted —

This information was essential.

This

C.o

1

he was charged with murder.
Under our State code murder is the killing of a human

2
3

being when the offender has a specific intent to kill or to

4

inflict great bodily ham.
In furtherance of carrying out our responsibility

5
3

to prove intent as a necessary:ingredient of the crime of

7

murder this evidence was admissible.

I have cited several,
\

\

a
9

■ State cases directly on point in which they deal with fee

1

question that when intent is a necessary ingredient of the

10

crime charged, it is something which goes to the determination

11

of the issue directly before the jury with respect to intentJ

12

That it is admissible.

13

our jurisprudence and many of those cases have been recognised

14

by this Court that there are exceptions to that general rule.

And there are long lists of cases in

We say we fall under it, No, 1, because it is our

15
13

statute.

It would not be within the province of this Court

17

to rewrite that statute under Spencer,
Secondly, even if this Court were to say that that

statute would be

21

State Court on the basis that we were showing motive and

intent.

unconstitutional, we say that this evidence

Q

Your view is that under the common design motive,

However, this case was tried prior to the effective

of that code of criminal procedure.
Spencer versus the State of Texas which focused atten­

tion on the issu$ raised herein was argued on October 17 and
18 of 1956 and was decided was decided on January 23, 1957,
which, of course, was subsequent to the taking of the appeal,
the filing of the bills of exceptions and the rendention of
pecurium by the trial court.
We also wish to call Your Honors' attention to the
decision of O'Conner versus Ohio decided by Your Honor in
1966, 87, S.Ct. 252, 385, U.S. 92 in which case Your Honors
actually took jurisdiction of a matter which had not been
raised in the trial court and held that since the defendant
was not in a position to literally foresee the action which
Your Honors were going to take in this particular case.
Q

That had to do with the comment rule, the Ohio
i
comment rule on the defendant's failure to testify.
A

Yes.

Q

Really, the Spencer case -— it is the Spencer

that you rely on, isn’t it?
A

Yes, sir.

We actually pinpoint the issue in the

Spencer dissent which literally focuses attention on it.

We

respectfully urge favorable consideration of our application.
Thank you, Your Honors.
(Whereupon, at 12:45 p.m. the argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.)
