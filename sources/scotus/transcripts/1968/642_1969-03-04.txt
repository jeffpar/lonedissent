Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

I represent Edward Boykin, Jr., who is the only man
in America that, awaits execution for the crime of common-law
robbery.

And if he is permitted to die will be the sixth man

to be executed by the State of Alabama in almost 40 years for
that crime.
This . case is before this Court on certiorari to the
Supreme Court of Alcibama.

That Court by a 4 to 3 decision

affirmed five death sentences.

Edward Boykin was brought to

trial on five separate indictments for robbery.
And a plea of guilty was entered and on that plea
he was sentenced to death five times.
Now, this case as I see it raises three grave consti­
tutional issues.

The first, one is that it violates the

Constitution Due Process Clausa for a conviction to be based
upon a plea of guilty where in the record of trial there is no
affirmative showing that that plea was voluntarily and
2

understandingly given.
2

Secondly, the imposition of the death penalty for the

3

common-law robbery violates the provision of the crual and.

4

unusual Eighth Amendment clause,

5

And thirdly, a statute which allows a jury 'unfettered

6

discretion in a capital case violates the petitioner's right

7

to due process,

8
9
10

Q

May I ask you whether that last point was raised

and decided below?

I have looked for it and I haven't been

able to find it,

11

A

Yes, it was.

12

Q

Would you show me where?

13
14

where it is?
A

It was raised below.
Would you tell me

I have looked for it and haven't found it,
Well, it was raised in my brief,

I do not know

15

whether the Supreme Court of Alabama considered it or not.

16

Their decision indicates that they did not.

Q

There is nothing in their decision on it?

There

is nothing in the papers that we have before us?
A

No, sir.

There is no treatment in the Supreme

Court of Alabama decision as to that point.
Q

I want to be very clear on this, Mr. Gibbons,

because it is a jurisdictional matter.

There is nothing in the

papers before us that shows that the point with respect to
your argument, with respect to the need for standards to guide
the jury in imposing punishment.
3

There is nothing in the papers

1

before us that shows that that was raised and decided below.

2

Am 1 right or wrong about that?

3

A

4

The only thing I can say is that it was raised

in the court below.
Q

Is your brief here in the Supreme Court of

7

X don51 know.

Q

That is where you say it was raised?

9

I don't know whether it is or not.

Alabama?

Well? what I was just about to say was that in

view of the oral argument on that specific point that is going
to be presented in Maxwell against Bishop, that in the time
limitation that X have, I am going to address myself to the
first issues, first two issues.
Q

Well, was the first issue raised below?

1 don’t

see that treated in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Alabama.,
A

Well, it was raised below in this sense, that

under the automatic appeal statute in Alabama, the Supreme Court
of Alabama must look at the entire record.
Q

They must note any clear error?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

That is the statute?

A

Yes, sir.
4

1

3

Q

You would say that anything that we might re­

verse they should have noted?
A

Well, they certainly noted that# because three

4

Justices in Alabama wanted to reverse on that first issue

5

which I am raising and which I intend to argue about now»

6

8
S

Q

But# again# did you argue that in your brief

before the Supreme Court of Alabama?
A

Wo# sir»

No# sir# I did not submit that issue

in my brief below.

10

Q

That was raised by the dissenting -—-

11

A

That was raised by the dissenting opinion.

Q

Was there a motion to withdraw the plea?

A

No# sir.

Q

Any stage?

A

No# sir.

Now# if I may —
Q

Was it represented by counsel?

A

He had a court-appointed attorney.

I might

explain to the court here that I am in the same position you
all are because I entered this case at the trial# at the
appellate level.

I was not even in the case until after the

sentence was given and everything.
Now# addressing myself# if I may# to this point# that
the due process clause required that a trial record show
affirmatively that the plea of guilty was voluntarily and
5

understandingly made, I think there are three points of reason­

■i

ing, that inevitably draws to that conclusion„

2
3

The first is, I don't think it is arguable, that a

4

plea of guilty must be voluntarily and understandingly made,,

5

That is because as I think we all realize that a plea of

6

guilty is an admission of guilt.

7

in effect.

It is a judicial confession

8

And certainly the waiver of such a fundamental right

9

to contest guilt, to give the prosecution the whole boat so to

10

speak, the waiver of that right is so fundamental that I don't,

11

think it is arguable, that it should be voluntarily and

12

understandingly given.
Secondly, that in order to be meaningful it must be

13
14

affirmative and this affirmative procedural step must appear on

15

the record because -- what I am saying here is thiss

16

you look at this record right here, you do not know and I do not

That if

know whether Edward Boykin entered his plea of guilty volun­

17

tarily and understandingly.

18

And yet he is going to have to die because of the

19

bareness of the record.

20

And it is a simple thing.

21

By analogy in is the same

reasoning that this court used in the Miranda decision.

22

There

there was a question of a waiver and this court said that if ir

23

a trial court if you are going to introduce an out-of-court,

M

confession, then the record must affirmatively show that that

25

S
I

1

2

confession was obtained voluntarily and understandingly.
The same thing is true that we are asking here.

3

you are going to rely on a plea of guilty, then the record

4

ought to shew it.

If

And we wouldn't have this trouble right

i to the maximum punishment.
I would like to comment about this record.
Q

What effect do you think the Alabama procedure

: has that notwithstanding the plea there must be a prima facie
case made out or that the plea is accepted?
A

Well, I don't think that has too much to do with

! the-issue that I am trying to speak about here for the reason
that that comes after the plea.
Q

Well, I knew.

I know.

But his plea doesn't

| become effective as the basis for carrying out the sentence
without that additional requirement being fulfilled, namely
the showing of the priraa facie case.
Isn't that the Alabama law?
A

Wo, sir, that is not the Alabama law.

The

■ Alabama law is that you put on a prima facie case as a sort
; of penalty trial, where you determine where —~ you let the jury

7

1

see what kind of a case if was.

But, a plea of guilty in

2

Alabama is a conviction of the offense»

3

Q

The jury cannot find the man innocent?

4

A

No.

5

Q

Isn’t that your answer?

6

A

Yes.» sir»

7

Now looking at the record, it is 35 pages for which

8
9
10

a man is going to die for and all that is in it, the first page
is an indictment, talking about robbery, not the death penalty.
It sets bail at $2500.
There is a proceeding of determining indigency where

11
12

13
14

15
16

the fellow is asked do you need an attorney and he says no.
There is in this record the testimony of the witnesses, the
complaining witnesses, and then the first time that the death
penalty is mentioned is in the almost pro forma instructions
of the judge when he gives the jury two forms.
If you are going to give him imprisonment, you use

17
18
19

20
21
22
23

24
25

That is right.

this form.

If you are going to use death, you use this form.

And then at that time the jury goes out and comes back in and
Edward Boykin is to die.

And that is all the record shows.

And that is what I am trying to say today.
Now, I just believe that the

Constitution,Due ."Proces 3

Clause requires that this affirmative showing be made.
Q

Did I understand that there was no motion at

any time to withdraw the plea of guilty?
8

1

A

There was no motion at any time? no, sir.

2

Q

1 am interested in the statement of facts on

3

page 7 of your brief that indicates that after this conviction

4

and death sentence there was an automatic appeal under Alabama

5

law.

6

A

Yes, sir, there is.

7

Q

But the Alabama Court, despite the conceded

e

indigency of the petitioner did not appoint counsel on appeal

9

and thereafter when a member of the Civil Liberties Union

io

attempted to represent him he i^as told that he could not because

1!

he wasn't authorized to practice?

14
15
1©

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

A

Yes, sir.

Q

And thereafter when, I guess you entered the case

it was too late as you say to raise any issue on motion for a
new trial as the statutory time period had elapsed.

I am

interested in knowing what that means.
A

Well, the date of the sentence starts the running

of the time when you can file a motion for a new trial.
Q

Here apparently the trial court neglected

actually to impose the sentence, didn’t he?
A

Well, he ---

Q

Or to set the date.

A

Well, he didn't set the date until the next day

when the defendant was brought back in for proper sentencing
as to form.
9

1

Q

2

A

Yes,
But the 30-day limitation started running on the

3

day of sentence which was the 21st of September»

4

in this case until the 27th of October when a friend of mine

5

told me he couldn't prosecute the appeal and would I fake it.

6

And at that time I got into it.

7

1 didn’t get

But, any sort of motion for new trial or grounds,

8

excessiveness of that sort of thing, that is all waived unless

9

you raise on a motion for a new trial,

10

Q

31

A

And that must be made within 30 days?
Yes, sir.

You see, the automatic appeal statute

12

in Alabama came prior or was enacted prior to Gideon against

13

Wainwright about counsel.

14

but you don’t get an automatic attorney on that appeal.

13

have to ask for it.

36

Q

But you have an automatic appeal

And by the time he had a lawyer the 30™day

17

period had elapsed?

18

been done if the 30-day period had not elapsed?

19

20

A

You

Can you fell us in a word what might have

Well, a motion for a new trial and some of the

grounds I am raising now —

21

Q

What?

Which ones?

22

A

Principally the excessiveness of the penalty in

23

the light of the offense.

Nobody expected -- now 1 can only

24

conjecture about this record.

25

Alabama gives the penalty for robbery about once every eight

Just as anybody can.

10

But

1

years.
Q

2

If we can just for a moment confine ourselves

3

if you would be willing to, to the question I asked.

4

could have been done within that 30-day period, that could not

5

have been done after the period?
A

6
7

10
?!

12

13
14
15

16
17
18
19

A motion for a new trial could have been filed

a:id heard by the trial court.
Q

9

What

Yes.

Of course, he did have trial counsel,

didn't he?
A

He had court appointed counsel for the trial.

Q

Yes, he was appointed by the court but he had

trial counsel.
A

His duties under Alabama practice are over when

the sentence comes in.
Q

Doesn't embrace any duties to make a motion for

a new trial, does it?
A

It is the view that attorneys take.

I personally

take the view that it goes all the way through parole, if he
needs help even after he gets paroled, if he gets a sentence.
*

20
21

22
23
24

But technically, or by application the trial appointed, court
appointed attorney duties are over.
Q

Yes, I practiced down there.

Now, I suppose after the sentence it would have been
too late then to withdraw the plea of guilty, or would it?
A

I believe it would.

25
11

Yes.

'

1
2

Q

A motion to withdraw the plea of guilty has to

he made before sentence?

3

A

Before submission to the jury.

4

I would like to address my further argument to the

5

second point and that is the question of applying the provision

6

of the Eighth Amendment prescription of cruel and unusual

7

against the offense of common-law robbery.

3
9

This is a direct attack upon Title 14, Section 415 of
the Code of Alabama which is the penalty statute for the

10

common-law offense of robbery.

1!

common-law offense of robberyy its essential elements, are the

12

taking of property from a person with the violence or with the

13

threat of violence.

14

And we all know that the

Now, the attack on this statute is because the

15

breadth and range of it are simple assault with a larceny can

IS

give you the death penalty under this statute.

17

Now, in application of this provision of the Eighth

13

Amendment, this Court has indicated certain standards or

19

certain things that they look at.

20

not a static concept, that it is not a nonprogressive thing,

21

that it moves with the times.

22
23
24
25

One of them is that it is

And that they have even indicated — you have even
indicated that in a more enlightened society it might encompass
greater and greater things.

And 1 am saying to this Court

today that Alabama is the only State that has this conunon-law •
12

1

offense of robbery with the death penalty.
And I submit that in the light of this Court5s

2
3

decisions, decisions such as Weems 60 years ago, when this

4

Court knocked down a punishment where a fellow, he falsified

5

soma Government documents and he got 12 years imprisonment and.

&

loss c£his civil rights, this Court at that time, 1910, said

?

that one of the standards is the disproportionate, dispro-

8

portionality of the offense with the punishment.
Now looking directly at Alabama, Alabama, the crime of

9
10

unpremeditated murder, with malice in Alabama, the maximum

II

punishment is life imprisonment.

12

assault you can get the death penalty.
I respectfully submit that this standard of dispro-

13
14

portionality is applicable to Edward Boykin.

15

!6
17
18

23
24
25

You mean robbery, don't you?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

What is the difference between common-law robbaryj?

A

/

Common-law robbery.

The other States have a statutory form of

robbery, classifying it in aggrevation.

Which adds what to attacking the man, threatening

with a weapon, threatening to kill him or something, and taking
his money.

What does it add to that?

The other States.

A

It adds the description of aggrevation.

Q

I mean what conduct does he have to do in addition
13

I

to that?
A

2

Wellp in a statutory, in an armed robbery

3

statute he has to be armed, or he has to kill somebody or

4

whatever classification or qualification these statutes give it.
Q

5

But all the statutory robberies as I understand

6

it ara based on the fact that one raan meets another or finds

7

him, threatens him with a weapon if he doesn't give him his

S

property and takes it away from him or tries to.

Alabama can snatch a book away from another student and under
the statute in Alabama he can get death.
Q

That is conceivable, but did you ever hear of

a thing like that?
A

As well as common-law robbery?

Isn't that

No, sir, I never have, nor have I ever heard

really in terms of thinking that a fellow who didn't kill
anybody wouldn’t get death, wouldn’t sacrifice his own life for
it.
Q

You mean you have never heard of anybody being

convicted for robbery without killing somebody?
A

No, sir, I am saying that it is shocking to think

even under the Judeo-Christian concept that we work on that a
life must be taken when no life was taken.

Q

The threatened victim, his life is pretty dear,

too, isn't it?

11

A

Most dear.

12

Q

Mr. Gibbons, the printed Appendix doesn't con­

13
14
15

tain any transcript at all of how this jury was qualified, the
voir dire of the jury.

Is there

a typewritten transcript of that in the original record?
A

16
17

Is that available anywhere?

It is not available and assuming that the

practice is as I know it to be, it was not transcribed.
Q

13

Can you -- I have in mind as perhaps you might

19

guess the decision of this Court in the Witherspoon Case,

20

Witherspoon against Illinois, you make no contention under that

21

decision but it occurred to me that there might well be one to

22

make.
A

23
24
25

disclose.

That may be so, but the record dhere doesn't
I mean I know, or it is conjecture.

I don't want to

go outside of the record, but the practice is to qualify them
15

1

as they have been doing for a long time and that is if you have

2

got

3

a contravention with the Witherspoon case.

I think if it had appeared in the record you would have

4

Q

Does the statutes or laws or case laws of Alabama

5

with respect to qualifying a jury in a capital case throw any

6

light on this question?

7

A

8

Q

What is that?

9

A

They hold that if a challenge for cause, if a

10

What is the purport of that?

prospective juror has any hesitency in giving the death penalty.

11

12

Yes, sir.

Q

It occurs to me that you are representing a

client under sentence of death have put a good many eggs in one

3

basket.

4

to make it or perhaps Federal habeas corpus is a more appropriate

15

If you have a Witherspoon claim it might behoove you

place for that.
Q

IS

Perhaps you considered that.
Mr. Gibbons, as I understand it, you are here

17

attacking the constitutionality of the Alabama statute on its

8

face; that is to say, you are saying that the statute is bad

9

apart from

the facts of this particular case, because the

20

statute authorizes the jury to fix a death sentence in the

21

case of robbery.
You point out that Alabama uses a common-law definition

22
23

of robbery.

I don8t remember seeing in your brief a reference

24

to just how Alabama views the definition of common-law crime of

25

robbery.
6

From your argument 1 take it that any sort of unlawful

1

2

taking, do you need force?
A

A taking with violence or with the threat of

5

Q

Right»

6

Now there are states in which the crime of armed

3

4

7

violence»

robbery is punishable by death?

a

A

Yes, sir.

9

Q

And what happened here was in fact an armed

10

robbery.

11

to say, that Boykin was carrying a gun, Boykin did in fact use

12

the gun in robbery, Boykin did in fact discharge the gun, and

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

There is no dispute about that, is there?

That is

in fact a girl in the store was wounded in the calf of her
leg.

Am I correct?
A

Yes, sir.

That is correct.

Q

Nov? that would be armed robbery within the

definition of other States, right?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

Your point, however, is that it is not necessary

is your point that it is not necessary for us to reach the
constitutionality of the armed robbery death penalty statutes
because you are asking us to consider this statute on its face
without reference to the facts of this particular case.
that right?
A

That is correct, sir.
17

Is

Aside from what this Court may think of murder say,
1

2
3

*

as justifying the death penalty, the question before the Court
as I see it and the issue I am trying to make is that the
death penalty for robbery is cruel and unusual»

It is dis­

4
proportionate, it comes in a time when no other State except

5
Alabama applies it»

6
Q

But your problem, however, is that here you have

7
an armed robbery, and you have an armed robbery in the course

8
of which sombody, Boykin did shoot and somebody was wounded»

So it is not just a simple unaggrevated robbery.

Your attack

10

must be, well I suppose you wouldn't be averse to attacking
11

that as a basis for the death penalty, but the other part of
12

your attack I take it is that the statute is bad for over­

13
breadth .

14
A

It is bad on its face because of the expanse and

15
range to which it can be applied.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. CLARK, ESQ,
21

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

23
Court.
24
In April and May of 1966, Mobile, Alabama, experienced
25

1

a series of robberies.

2

Grand Jury returned five indictments against him for robbery.

3

I would like to point out the time element and the space of

4

the city involved.

One Edward Boykin was arrested, a

These five robberies took place from April 23, 1966

5
8

— that was the first one —■ there was one on May 3, one on

7

May 5, May 6 and one on May 8.
The manner of operation was that this young man went

8
9

into either a grocery store or drug store or service station

10

and would exhibit a pistol and commit robbery and than when he

11

would leave he would fire the pistol so nobody would follow him

12

out.
There was one wounding of a little girl.

13

I believe

14

the evidence showed that he fired into the floor and the bullet

15

ricocheted.and his this young lady in the leg.

these questions being properly presented, or do you?

I am not going to argue that.

I think it explains some of it, your Honor,

3

Q

Do you speak about that in your brief?

4

A

No,

5

Q

It is a jurisdiction question, isn’t it?

6

A

Which particular question was that, your Honor?

7

Q

Whether we can reach questions which were not

8
9

raised and decided in the State Supreme Court.
A

Well, I feel that under this section entitled

10

15, Section 382(1)-13 wherein the Supreme Court considered all

11

the things raised at the trial that you could do that, sir.

12

Q

As far as it appears from what I have been able

13

to glean, and, of course, we don't have the briefs of the parties

14

before the Supreme Court before us, but really nothing at all

15
IS
17
18

20
21

25

was raised at the trial.

There was simply a guilty plea and

as the counsel has said, five sentences of death on this
petitioner.
And that is all that appears, plus some evidence of
his conduct.

And then in the Supreme Court of Alabama all that

appears that they considered of the questions raised here was
whether or not the trial court failed to protect the petitioner9j
right to due process with regard to his plea of guilty as you
put it and that is the only things they considered.
Neither one of the other two questions so far as I
can find out was raised or considered or decided in any of the
20

1

courts of Alabama.

2

A

Am I wrong about that?

No, sir, you are correct.

It could have been

3

considered although they did not mention it under that Title

4

15, Section 382.

5

Q

Well, why, it wasn’t raised at the trial?

6

A

No

7

Q

Either one of these?

8

A

Not raised at the trial.

1 would

like to call your Honor’s attention to Appendix Pa4e 10 and 11.

wherein Mr. Sidney Flager, the Assistant District Attorney

15

prosecuting the case pointed out they had 12 jurors sitting in

16

a box, would they be all right and the defendant there said

they would and his attorney, Mr. Austin, said they would.

Is there anything other than that?

do that.

However, as this Court pointed out, I believe it

was in Giaccic versus Pennsylvania — it was one of them —

3

that they could do that, a jury could find a degree.

4

is nothing prohibiting that.

There

Now, 1 would point out that in Alabama, robbery is

a capital offense.

That, of course, means it carries the death

penalty and they can to a lesser degree give anywhere from

death on down to 10 years.

That is left to the jury5s dis~

Now, in spite of no instructions, you do have this,

to
11

that this jury has heard the entire trial.

12

to determine how server a case of robbery this is, and this

13

particular instance there was a gun used, there was violence.
They could pass on that.
They are the best ones to judge how severe the

sentence should be.

Yes, sir, that is the entire evidence put on.

In Alabama when you have a plea of guilty such as we had here,
they put on a prima facie case.

Now, in all five of these

cases I think they called seven witnesses.

That is all that is

required, that you have the man pleading guilty which is a
judicial confession to that effect, that he entered a plea of
guilty.
25

They have that plus the prima facie case made out by

Is that automatic?

Yes, sir.

That is automatic.

I have been at some of them that

20

they have had as many as 35 or 40 people, to speak for this
man and ask that his case be commuted to life imprisonment.

21

But as you pointed out, there has been none in this case.

22

Q

23

When was the last execution in Alabama?

You

didn't have one last year, did you?

24

A

25

No, sir.

It has been several years.

26
s

In my

1

brief I point out one that was in 1964„

I handled that case

2

through the Alabama Supreme Court and it went on to an electro-

3

cution.

That incidentally was one for robbery.

4

Q

But it also involved a very horrible killing.

5

A

Yesf sir.

6

May I explain that?

7

Q

I think you did in your brief.

0

A

Yes, sir,

9

Q

Certainly you can explain it.

10

A

Well, I went over it lightly.

But .in that

11

particular case there was a robbery. Also the man committed a

12

murder during this robbery.

It just happened that he was

13

going with this young lady.

He was a married man with a family

14

and as the District Attorney determined in that case they had

15

the two indictments, one for murder and one for robbery, that

36

17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

it would be better to prosecute on the robbery.
In Alabama they regard robbery as a serious offense.
Wow a good attorney could have possibly attacked the young
lady’s reputation and maybe it would have been merely a
manslaughter conviction.
Q

I gather from all of the circumstances of the

robbery, including this very gruesome and bazarre sort of
killing were brought before the jury,

Is that correct?

A

Yes o

And what he took was the young woman’s car,

sentence.

9
10
11
12

He could ask for an appeal and been granted one.
Q

8

No, sir, that applies merely to the death

I gather that special statute of searching the

record, does that apply where the automatic appeal statute
applies?
A

No, sir, the appellate courts have that duty

in all cases»

Q

All cases,,

A

To look into the;

15

Q

All criminal appeals?

16

A

Yes, sir.

17

Q

I see.

18

A

record.

Now then, there was something brought out about

19

a. motion for a new trial.

20

attorney who is appointed to handle the defense of that trial.

21

Also, in a case which results in the death penalty, the same

22
23
24

25

Usually that is done by the

attorney goes right on through the Supreme Court.

His one

appointment takes effect.
However, Mr. Gibbons is representing the defendant
cn appeal to the Supreme Court of Alabama and on certiorari to
28

1

this court.

2

Q

May I ask you further, let us suppose that a

3

defendant were tried on one account of robbery, then the jury

4

has a problem of fixing the punishment.

5

I don't suppose there is anything like presentence

6

report or any evidence introduced to his history, is there?

7

What is your practice?

8

front of the jury -—

9

A

10

Q

Is there any effort to duplicate in

No, sir.
what is in the ordinary presentence report

11

about the man's family background, what kind of a person he

12

has been and whether this is an isolated incident or part of a

13

long history of crime, the sort of thing that a judge usually

14

has before him?

15
16
17

A

No, sir, not in this type of case because the

jury returns the verdict.-

However, the defendant could put. on

character witnesses and things' of that nature during the trial.

13

Q

During the trial?

19

A

Yes, sir.

20

Q

But suppose he had led an exemplary life and

21

suppose his counsel decided that for strategic reasons that he

22

didn't want to get the question of guilt, whether he did this

23
24
25

or not, mixed up with the facts about the man's life which was.
of course, the kind of thing conceivable.

I have badly

described it but I am sure you will agree that it is conceivable
29

s

1

that a lawyer might make a strategic judgment of that sort.

2
3

Then the jury would have to consider punishment with­
out anything before it as to what kind of man this is.

4
5
6

A

That is true»

That would be a matter of trial

Q

Well, it might be a very critical one in which

strategy.

7

the lawyer makes a judgment in good faith and with professional

8

competence that he later desperately regrets»

9

A

Yes.

10

Q

And his client who is electrocuted probably

11

regrets it even more»

12

A

I feel that this case here represents one

13

because this attorney entered a plea of guilty for the man and

14

I suppose assuming that there would be a prison sentence»

15

What brought this on as I pointed out earlier, there had been

16

a series of robberies and the jury returned this verdict»

17

Q

This trial took place in September of 1966?

13

A

That is correct, sir»

19

Q

That is when the jury was impanelled, sworn

20
21
22
23
24
25

as indicated on page 10 of the Appendix?
A

Correct»

Q

Long before this Court's decision in the

Witherspoon case so that the defense counsel was not aware of
any right to challenge the jury on the basis of Witherspoon
— constitutional basis on ’which Witherspoon was decided»
30

1

That is correct, isn't it?

2

A

That is true.

However, he did have those

3

challenges that are set out in Title 30, Sections 55 and 57„

4

And in my argument last week I pointed out that if he had a

5

fixed opinion against capital punishment, with either one on

6

Section 57, however, we contend that they waive that.
Q

7

It wasn't a known waiver, was it?

It couldn't

8

have been any known waiver of any right under the Witherspoon

9

case.

The Witherspoon case hadn't been decided.
A

10

And that is another thing I would like to point

11

out to this court.

12

back before the State Court on coram nobis and bring these

13

things up»

14

This man still has his opportunity to go

At that time he will be appointed an attorney and

15

they would have a full hearing on these matters, the identical

16

matters brought up here.

17

Q

Is it still thought in Alabama that good

13

character alone could be charged to the jury as sufficient

19

to generate a reasonable doubt of guilt?

20

A

Yes, sir.

21

Q

Well, here there was a plea of guilty?

22

A

Yes, sir, that is right.

23

Q

Does the court not inquire into the voluntariness

24

of a plea in Alabama?

25

A

Yes, sir, they should.
31

The record does not

]
2

reflect that here.
Q

Well., wouldn't you think that it should be done

3

by all means in a capital case where a man's life is at stake?

4

Why wasn't it done here?

5

A

6

your Honor.

7

Q

Can you tell us whether it was or was not dona?

0

A

Ho, sir.

9

14
15
16
17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Yes, sir.

I don’t know that it wasn't done,

It is just recorded as such.

I was not. present at the trial.

However, I would like to point out to your Honor, you have
Flule 11 of your Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that require
such warning to the defendant and while no particular ritual nee
be observed by the trial court, such as a formal finding, a
recitation of plea presented with understanding, and an
affirmative duty, that nonetheless it exists on the part of
the Trial Court to advise the accused fully.
And chat was cited from Hulsey versus the United
States, 369 F„ 2d 284.

So apparently in your Federal Court

on your Federal rules you have a duty, you don't have to
affirmatively show that in the record.

There is no showing

that this man was not advised of the seriousness of his plea.
Besides that, he had an attorney representing him.
Q

Who tried the case?

A

This particular one was before Judge Gilliard.

Q

How long had he been a judge?

A

Judge Gilliard has been on the bench I think
32

1

about six or eight years as a Circuit Judge,

2

served as a Probate Judge,

3

Q

What are his initials?

Palmer is his brother, I believe.

9

Q

10

And his

He was our

He died at the age of 103.

The judge, and I am looking at page 33 of the

11

Appendix, in sentencing the petitioner indicated, at least by

12

negative implication, if you will, that he had some discretion

13

not to follow the jury’s recommendation of the death sentence.

14

Is that right?

15

A

Yes, sir.

16

Q

He says in case

No. 15520,the

Court will impose

17

sentence according to the verdict of the jury.

18

No. 15521 the Court will again follow the verdict of the jury,

19

And so on.

20

he didn’t have a duty to do so.

And so, which leads to a possible implication that

21

What is the law in Alabama on that?

22

A

23
24
25

And in case

Notwithstanding the verdict I believe the judge

could send it back.
Q

Send it back

to whom?

2

Wo* sir.

Now there was something brought out in

the brief about the finding of guilty by the jury and the fixing
of the sentence by that same jury violated his constitutional
rights.
34

1 believe this Honorable Court in a footnote in

1

2

Giaecio versus Pennsylvania held that in so holding we intend

3 to cast no doubt whatever on the constitutionality of the
4

subtle practice in many states to juries fixing defendants

5

guilty of crime the power to fix punishment within legally

prescribed limits„

7

Now, I found two cases wherein courts that followed

That was in a murder

10

case, however, but they had there under 1 believe Section 160

of their Criminal Code that a jury could find the person

12

guilty of murder in the first degree and on Section 160.1

same jury could fix his punishment at either death or life

The Supreme Court of California held that that was

no violation of his constitutional rights.

This same thing is

versus Smith in the Washington Supreme Court on October 29,

And the last paragraph of that opinion I think is
pertinent here.
"The defendants argument against the death sentence
on maul and practical grounds are persuasive." However, they

questions.

Mr. Clark, I am sorry to ask you so many
May I ask you a question about the nature of the

trial here.
Now, robbery is a capital offense.
A

That is correct.

Q

And the Court — does the Court accept the guilty

plea without more, or is this a trial on the question of guilt?
Was the jury informed that the defendant had pleaded guilty?
A

Yes*, sir.

They were informed.

Q

That doesn’t appear here, does it?

But they are

informed that the defendant had pleaded guilty?
A

Yes, sir.

it doesn’t appear from the record

here, but when there has been a plea of guilty in Alabama the
jury hears a prima facie case to determine the seriousness of
the crime.
Q

In other words — do you argue that in a sensa

this is not. a unitary trial, what happened here?

In a sense

j that this trial was on the question of punishment?
A

Yes, sir.

That was meant principally the
36

1

question of punishment.

2

already.

There had been a plea of guilty

3

Q

And that, that plea of guilty is accepted --

Yes, sir.

case.

Suppose this had been a murder

Is it the custom in Alabama to accept a plea of guilty?
A

Usually when they enter a plea of guilty to

8

murder they will enter a plea of guilty to murder for the

9

second degree which would cover the life sentence.

10

11

52
13

Q

Well, if it is clear, but you don't know of

any situation where ——
A

No, sir.

They usually try those, for first

degree murder.

14

Q

They go to trial?

15

A

They go to trial.

IS

Q

And they don't accept a plea of guilty?

17

A

No, sir.

18

Q

But in spite of the fact that the ultimate

Yes, sir.

19

result may be the same here, namely electrocution, in a

robbery case the Court will accept and lay before the jury the

plea of guilty?

Q

Is that x-ight?
Yes, sir.
Are you saying that as a matter of law the court,

does not allow you to accept a plea of guilty to first degree
murder in Alabama or are you just -31

your Honor.

3

Q

1 know of no case in which that has happened,

Is there any such laxtf in your State?

I know of none»

But in practice ---

a plea to second degree murder?

10

A

That is correct.

11

Q

Well, if they plead guilty to murder in the

12

first degree unless it is changed since I was

13

A

Yes.

14

Q

The Judge is required to call a jury to give

15

the jury enough evidence to show a prima facie case, just

18

that number of witnesses and to show, give the. jury enough

\7

information with which it supposedly they could rest a verdict.

18

And that is the way it was done in the first degree.

19

A

That has not.

20

Q

Has that been changed?

21

A

22

I believe Mr. Justice Black has answered my question.

23

Q

No.

So it is not. just , a penalty trial as perhaps you.

24

stated and I didn't get the implication of it.

25

something more than just a penalty trial.
38

This is

It is a penalty

1

trial plus a trial in which prima facie case is made that the

2

guilty plaa is warranted?
A

3
4

Yes, sir, you could not have the conviction

without putting on a prima facie case.
Q

3

Could the jury after the prima facie case goes

6

in and the judge says, lets it go to the jury, is the jury

7

permitted to find him innocent?

8

A

No, sir.

It would not be on this robbery.

9

Q

Didn't the jury’s verdict actually recite that

10

the jury found him guilty as charged the indictment on his

11

plea of guilty?

12

A

Yes, sir.

13

Q

That is what the verdict actually cited?

14

A

Yes, sir.

15

Q

What happens if the judge finds that a prima

16

I think that is what they said.

facie case has not been made up?
A

He could so instruct the jury.

18

Q

And direct what?

19

A

That no prima facie case was made up.

17

20
21

assume the defense counsel would then move for a direct
acquittal.

22

Q

After a plea of guilty?

23

Q

After a plea of guilty?

A

That wasn’t in the case.

Q

Well, I mean, does that ever happen?

24
25

And I

39

1

A

No, sir.

Not to my knowledge.

A prima facie

2

case wouldn't take too much to put on, your Honor, just one or

3

two witnesses at the most.

4

Q

Well, 1 have a very vivid recollection of that

5

factor because I was appointed to the — and as it was a jury

7

was not to get this.
The jury came back and tried to defy the court's order

9

I had a trait whereby he

They wanted to give him the death sentence on the prima facie

10

case and the judge finally told them they could give it to him

11

but he would set it aside.

And so they accepted it.

12

A

Yes, sir.

That is what I mentioned a while ago.

13

Q

That was the practice then, to my knowledge.

14

Q

Mr. Clark, I notice that page 25 of Petitioner's

15

brief that he raises the question a guilty plea can be effec­

16

tive must be made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.

17

And he says a trial judge has an affirmative constitutional

18

duty to ascertain whether or not a guilty plea was voluntarily

19

made.

20

A

Yes.

21

Q

Nov?, if we take this record as it is in this

22

transcript, there is nothing to indicate that there was any­

23

thing done by the Court to determine whether it was voluntarily

24

made, must we assume that this is all that the Court went on?

25

A

Yes, sir, because that is substantially the same
40

i

as the original record.
Wo, sir.

3

You are assuming that he did not because

it does not appear in the record.
Q

However, oh, I get what you mean, sir.

t his record.
A

6

Yes,

Is that right?

I would assume that we must decide it on

That is all there is on the subject matter,
Yes,

Now the case Carnley versus Cochran that

7

he cited in support of that had to do with the confession, I

believe.
I did cite a case wherein there was no particular

format that they had to use, nothing in the Federal —
Q

11

It isn’t a question of format.

There was

absolutely nothing here.

nothing.

consider to negate this statement that a trial judge has

15

affirmative constitutional duty to ascertain whether or not

16

a guilty plea was voluntarily made?

17
18
19

That is the problem.

Absolutely

Now, is there anything in the record that we can

A

Wo, sir.

But all that appears there is not

shown in the record, exactly the questions he asked.
Q

Well, if we decide this issue, this particular

20

issue, are we entitled to decide it fairly on what is in this

21

transcript and nothing more?

22
23
24
25

A

Yes, sir.

That is all the spoken axid written

words that were transcribed and put in the record, either in
the record that was before the Alabama Supreme Court or this
Honorable Court.

there is nothing that requires, to my knowledge, that it appear

in the record that he did so advice and in fact say,

When I get back to Mobile I might be able to think of

Edward Boykin wouldn’t need a post

Go ahead.

Yes, sir.

Make it your last point.
