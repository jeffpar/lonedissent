No. 624, Clyde A. Perkins,

A. Perkins, filed this suit

against the respondent, Standard Oil Company of California,
in March of 1959, ten years ago, alleging violations of Sections
2(a),

(d) and (e) of the Clayton Act as amended by the

Robinson-Pafcjnan Act of 1936.
In December of 1963, the jury awarded the petitioner

23

actual damages of $336,407.57 which was trebled and attorneys

Approximately eight months later, July of '68, the
Court of Appeals denied the appellees petition for rehearing,

I

Now before proceeding to a discussion of the Ninth
Circuit's Clayton Act holding, I would like briefly to identify
the parsons involved and the state the facts which I think are
essential to an understanding of this portion of the Ninth
Circuit's decision.
Petitioner Perkins was one of the largest independent
distributors in the Pacific Northwest States of Oregon and
Washington.

He began business in 1928, with a single filling

station and over the years built a wholesale and retail gasoline
business and during the claim period, March 2 to December 2,
March 2, 1955 to December 2, 1957, he leased or operated
approximately 60 retail stations,
Perkins was a wholesaler operating trucking equipment
and bulk storage plants.

He purchased substantially all of

hi,s requirements from Standard Oil of California.

There is

some indication that he purchased a little elsewhere, but the
record shows that this was at the instance of Standard to test

24
the market for the price.

He was required to maintain a bulk storage plant and

Selling its gasoline to its own branded dealers, the
Chevron and Sigaal brands, and the wholesalers like Perkins
and Signal Oil and Gas.

Signal Oil and Gas purchased during

the claim period its requirements from Standard Oil.
Now Signal Oil and Gas is a large integrated company
engaged both in the production of crude oil and the distribution
of gasoline in the Western United States.
Signal has been both a supplier and a customer of
Standard since the early 308s.

It drew its supplies directly

from Standard's storage facilities near Portland and at Seattle
during the claim period, and it purchased during that period
only from Standard in that area.
It re-invoiced its purchases from Standard, had no
storage facilities.

It drew from a standard bulk facilities.

It was in competition with Perkins.

It re-invoiced the Western

Highway Oil Company which was incorporated in 1950 with Signal
owning 60 percent of its stock.

Western

functions as Signal's transportation

arm in Oregon, picking up gasoline from Standard's Willbridge

3

terminal in Portland and delivering it to retail stations in

4

Portland, operated by the Regal Stations Company.

5

These stations, there were three, were no more than

S

150 blocks from the bulk plant and Western Byway's function was

7

to take its trucks and transport the gasoline to those stations,

8

from the Standard bulk plant.

Regal was formed in 1956, when with Western Hyway
owning 55 percent of the stock, and in 1957 Western Hyway,
the Signal Oil and Gas subsidiary, acquired 100 percent of the
stock of Regal.
It operated three stations in the Portland area which
competed with stations owned by Perkins.

Now, these stations

were set up near the third quarter of 1956, at a time through
to 1957, early '57, these three Regal stations in the Portland
area, at a time when Signal Oil and Gas, when Regal — when
Signal Oil and Gas of which Regal was part of the family, was
carrying on its books a rebate, an anticipated rebate which
was later paid.

20

In fact, the rebate was paid in January of 1957 by
21

Standard to Signal.

Signal already had anticipated that and

22
had it on its books and there had been negotiations since
23

spring for this rebate.
24

Now these stations were set up in that time context.
25

1

These three Regal stations in Portland and they immediately

started a price war»
The Court of Appeals set aside the entire jury

3

verdict in favor of Perkins because some of the petitioner's

5

proof on the 2(a) aspects of his claim, the Section 2(a)

S

the amended Clayton Act, demonstrated that Signal, the whole™

7

saler obtaining the better price, resold the gasoline to‘"Westerr

8

Hyway who in turn resold to yet another subsidiary, Regal,
The Ninth

9
10
11
12

13
14

17

Circuit ruled as a matter of law that

Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, and I am quoting,
"Does not recognize a causal connection essential to liability
between a supplier's price discrimination and the trade prac­
tices of a customer as far removed on a distributive ladder
as Regal was from Standard.
In other words, the Court of Appeals said that

15
16

of

Section 2(a) was limited in terms to three levels of cog­
nizable competitive injury, and that the injury to Perkins
occasioned by Regal's marketing activities did not come within

18
19

the purview of those three level's limitations.
Since a large part of Perkins damage was attributable

20
21

22

to the activities of Regal which operated at the fourth level
of distribution, the entire verdict was deemed tainted and
set aside.

23
We respectfully submit that the Court of Appeals
24
erred in so holding.

First the jury properly could have returne d

25
6

s

a verdict against Standard on the ground that the effect of its

2

price discrimination in favor of Signal may have been sub™

3

sfcanttally to lessen competition in the Pacific Northwest

4

wholesale and retail gasoline market»
Section 2(a) of the amended Clayton Act contains two

independent tests of illegality.

nation where the effect may be substantially to lessen com­

S

petition or to tend to monopoly in any line of commerce.
And then it has another test, to injury, destroy or

B
10

1?
12

prevent competition with any person who either grants, knowingly
receives the benefit of such discrimination or with the
i
customers of either of them.
The Ninth Circuit completely ignored the substan­

13

16

tiality to lessen competition standards, a carryover from the
original Clayton Act Section 2 in setting aside this jury’s
verdict.

Q

Did you try the case on that?basis?

A

Yes, your Honor, this was before the Ninth

It was before the jury.

Both Standard and Perkins

offered charges to the jury and the judge I think substantially
and properly charged the jury so that this question of overall
injury to competition and tendency toward monopoly was
properly before the jury.
New I would say that in retrospect, both Perkins and
Standard could have been far more explicit and extensive in

25

7

1

submitting proposed charges to the jury.

2

could have been more explicit and could have charged more

's

extensivelyo

4

And the judge perhaps

But the fact was that the whole question of injury

5

to competition and a tendency toward, monopoly, was before the

6

jury and the jury even though not as elegantly charged as

7

one — as some might wish that it were charged, was substantially

8

charged and knew what the res gestae was, knew what the questions

9

of fact were, knew what they had to decide.

22

The Court of Appeals exalted form at the expanse of
the economic reality by imposing an artificial, three™level
limitation on Section 2(a), to prevent discriminations which
tends to lessen competition in any line of commerce.
It failed to assign any weight, the Ninth Circuit
failed to assign any weight to the fact that Standard's price
discrimination had caused a substantial lessening of compe­
tition in the Pacific Northwest wholesale and gasoline
markets driving out of business one of the area’s largest
independents.
Moreover, by basing that limitation exclusively on
the number of persons in the distributive chain established
by the favored purchaser, that decision, if the Court please,
unless reversed, will enable large buyers virtually to insure

23

a statutory of immunity to suppliers which grant them favorable
24

price concessions.

Q

Mr. Kintner, suppose Regale Western and Signal

had all been totally independent of Standard, no control, no
interlocking directorates, no stock ownership up the line.

4

Would you still contend that 2(a) applied?

r

A

I think we have a different factual situation,

t-

but the realities in petroleum marketing are such that it is

7

the price of the retailer, the competition exists,at that

8

retail level, and if any one up the chain gets a better price

e

and is able to pass it along at the retail level, that you can

have absolute chaos at the retail level.
Q

Well, what I am trying to get at, as I under­

stand it, there is ownership all the way down the chain here in
this case in some stock ownership.

Is that right?

A

Yes.

Q

And what I am trying to get at is whether you

relied on the facts of stock ownership running from Standard
through Regal and Western and —■ or Standard, Signal, Western

I
I
and Regal. Whether you rely on that stock ownership or whether .1
i
you say that even without the stock ownership sales by Standard
to Signal at a lower price than sales by Standard to Parkins
would be a violation of 2(a)?
I
A

Well, we have alternative theories on this, of

course, depending on how you read the evidence, but we believe
23
24

and I urge upon the Court, that these were two families of
gasoline dealers and that the economic realities that the

25

I

retailers are tied to particular suppliers in the gasoline

z

business, and that it wouldn't matter if there was a lack of

3

ownership here and family connection, if the discrimination

4

were passed from Signal down to Regal stations and Perkins

5

who had his own chain of stations, was unable to compete.

6

The damage occurred at the retail level because Perkir

7

either had to take a loss or he had to see his stations com-

8

pete on an unequal basis.

Am I clear?

Are you clear on this?

A

Yes.

Q

Would, you say that that is a violation of 2(&)7

I think you will have to go back to the rela­

They were independent dealers and wholesalers.

And if the Perkins Company is unfairly discriminated
against, it is unable to pass down through its chain of dis­
tribution the equivalent benefits that can be passed through
by Signal, and the proof of the pudding is in the eating at
the retail level.
Now 1 think that it makes a harder case if there is
a family relationship as there

is here, and you have got

alternatives which one didn’t have in the Hamm Brewing case
where in Duluth and Superior, the distributors, the two
distributors of the Hamm Company were unable to compete across
the State lines, although this was one market.
But the Superior distributor was given a better price
and his retailers then were able to take advantage of the
retailers on the other side of the State line in the same
market, take their customers away, simply because the better
price was passed down the line at the retail level.
As we read it. Section 2(a) prohibits all price

24
discrimination, the effect of which may be substantially

competition in a commercially significant product, regardless

Z

of the functional level»

3

It was before the jury and all of the economic setting and

4

the charges given by the judge, and it is in this instance

5

that we feel that basically the Ninth Circuit was wrong.

This is our theory of the case»

3

In George Van Camp and Sons versus American, a 1928 case

7

prior to the passage of the Robinson-Patman Amendment in 1936

8

and decided prior to that amendment, the court rejected the

9

defendant's argument that its price discrimination could not be

19
20
21

24
25

challenged by a purchaser because the words must be confined
to the line of commerce in which a distributor is engaged.
The court ruled that the words in any line of commerce literally
are outside of all the various lines of commerce.
The point in the favored purchasers chain of distribution
at which injury to competition is first felt is of concern only
with respect to the factual questions of causation, not with
respect to whether the statute had been violated as a matter
of law.
We feel that this Court should bring its Section 2 of
the Clayton Act in harmony with its interpretations in the
Van Camp Decision prior to the passage of the Robinson-Patman
Act and in harmony of its interpretations of the same language
in Sections 3 and 7 of the Clayton Act.
Standard was a price leader and a principal leader of
gasoline in the Pacific Northwest.
12

Perkins was bound to

1

purchase the vast bulk,"if not all of its gasoline from

2

Standard.

3

Perkins was marketing eight percent of Standard's gasoline in

4

one-third of that market

5

the claim period he lost 13 percent of his gallons, he lost

S

50 percent of his fuel oil business which is tied to gasoline,

7

as the record shows, and Signal, the distributor, the

8

independent distributor from Standard, in whose favor the

9

discrimination was granted, gained 50 percent during that claim

It was a market dominated by the majors.

In fact,

to which he was confined, and during

i
I

period if gallons.

10
11

As Perkins' expert witness, Dr. Mund, testified in re-

12

sponse to a hypothetical question, the foreseeable market trend j

13

in that area was to increase concentration, a decline of small

14

business, and higher gasoline prices, and he said, in other

15

words, that price discrimination and monopoly are Siamese

16

twins.
Perkins during this period before he went out of business,

17

constantly begged Standard for price assistance.

10
19

It was only

one month before Signal's president went on the stand, who

'

20

had been denying giving price assistance, that they finally
'

21

22
23
24
25

admitted a discrimination of $1 million.
Perkins finally got some price assistance.

It was a

small amount, and it amounted for all his 60 stations what
Standard gave one of its branded stations in a 75 day period.
Signal was even able during the claim period to offer to
13

1

sell to Perkins gasoline at .75 per gallon lower on regular

2

and .80 on ethyl,

3

denied it was discriminating in favor of Signal.

4
5

.6

although Standard when faced with this

We submit on the basis of the foregoing that the jury
could have found not only that a substantial lessening of
competition was threatening, but that a substantial demunition

7

in the figure of competition had already occurred, and thus

8

the jury's verdict was supportable on this basis.

9

We do not believe this was the intention of the Congress

10

in changing only a split infinitive, directing only a split

il­

infinitive when it passed the Robinson-Patman Amendment, that

ia

it was the intent of Congress to weaken the Robinson-Patman

13

Amendment.

14

This Court itself has said quite causatively to the

15

contrary in the

16

Court was, "The legislative history of these amendments leaves

17

no doubt that the Congress was intent upon strengthening the

10

Clayton rAc

19

Anheuser-Busch Decision, the opinion of this

Restrictions, not weakening them."

The Congress did not intend that that language regarding

20

competition, injury to competition and a tendency toward

21

monopoly should become mere surplusage with respect to the

22
23
24
25

i

amended Clayton Act.
It conferred upon small business a less stringent remedy
when it passed that Robinson-Patman Amendment, but it left
the more stringent remedy to those like Perkins who had an
14

i

ample record to prove the violation of the, original standards

2

of the Clayton Act, Section 2.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN: Mr. Kucik.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE R. KUCIK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR. KUCIK:

7

I will address myself to the question of causation and

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.

8

damages.

9

is simply whether there was enough evidence before the jury

The first question is causation.

The issue there

10

from which it could reasonably infer that Perkins' distribu­

11

tion as an independent marketer of gasoline was approximately

12

caused by the price discrimination in favor of Signal Oil and

13

Gas Company.

14
'15

Now, in the content of the Ninth Circuit's opinion in its
reversal, the causation period in question which is important

16

for the purposes of this case, is a period from September of

17

1956 through December of 1957.

18

the Portland area in Oregon.

19

It involves in the beginning

The most important parties are Signal, which was purchasing

20

gasoline from Standard, and Regal Stations Company, which was

21

marketing the gasoline

22

was repurchasing from Signal and trucking the gasoline to and

23

from the Wigrich's Terminal to the retail outlets.

24
25

in the Portland area. Western Hyway

Now, the period, as I pointed out, is September 1956
through December 1957.

Immediately prior to that time none of

15

1

the members of Signal’s corporate family were in the Portland

2

area.

3

Hyway was trucking no gasoline and there were no regular

4

outlets in Portland in late August.

5

Signal was lifting no gasoline from Wigrich.

Regal opened its first

Western

station in Portland in September
•

<■ •

6

and Western at that time began to truck the gasoline.

7

out the period there was an admitted discrimination in price in

3

favor of Signal Oil and Gat? by Standard.

9

admitted.

Through­

It was not always

In fact, it was hotly contested prior to the

10

deposition of Signal’s president, but the day before that

11

Standard admitted the discrimination and it is an admitted

12

fact before this Court.
So the price of the gasoline was always lower going into

13
14

the Signal chain of distribution, the wholesale, and it

15

always came out lower.

16

in the market throughout the period.

17

opened its station, it dropped retail prices by four cents.
Q

18

Regal consistently underpriced Perkins
Indeed, when Regal first

Is the Regal activity evidence essential to just

19

prove damages to you, or to prove a violation of the act, or

20

both?

21

A

We have said that it was essential to prove both.

22

The Ninth Circuit Court reversed on the ground that the statute

23

did not encompass as a matter of law the activities of Regal.

24

Therefore, the damages caused by Regal could not become a part

25

of the verdict.

We are arguing that the status does -16

i

1

Q

You are saying that the discrimination between Perkins

2

and Signal was a price discrimination within the meaing of

3

the act, and that its impact on competition is an adverse

4

impact on competition at that level, between Perkins and

5

Signal, is encompassed by the act?

'

5

A

We are saying that.

7

Q

Once you show that, what else do you need to show?

8

Once you show the discrimination had an adverse effect at the
*

9

Perkins-Signal level, then what else do you need to show?
’

10

Do you need to show injury and the amount ,;of your damages?

12

That is correct» Standard has contested that the
;
\ .* ‘ • ■
price discrimination to Signal caused Perkins harm at the

13

retail level and therefore there was no way in which Perkins

11

A

.

i

i

14

could have been injured as a retailer or a wholesaler because

15

his harm as a wholesaler was derivative harm by virtue of the

16

fact his retailers were getting beat.

17
10
19

20

Q

Do you think the Ninth Circuit decided it was a

causation problem rather than a legal problem?
A

No, no.

The Ninth Circuit decided it was a

straight question of law.

21

Q

Why do we have to get to this other question?

22

A

We address ourselves to this question principally

23
24
25

because it is the overriding question in Standard’s rate.
Q

What if we agree with you that the Court of Appeals

was wrong in the question of law?
17

What should we do, decide

1

the causation or send it back to the Ninth Circuit?

z

A

Decide the causation question,

Q

Here?

4

!

That has never. be«sn decided by the Ninth

Sircult?
A

5

It is argued that the Ninth Circuit did decide it,
.

6

The Ninth Circuit has a. passage in footnote 6 of its opinions,

7

where it says, ’"Granting fchex'e was a price discrimination

8

in favor of Signal, and passed on to Regal, we hold it is not

9

accountable,"

10

Q

That can be argued as a causation?

11

A

The reason why we think it is arguable that was a

12

holding on causation, there was no question on the discrimina­

13

tion.

14

as a holding by the Ninth Circuit that there was causation.

15

That was admitted.

So you can fairly read that passage

In any event, the jury verdict was presumably based on the

16

jury finding of causation, and the Ninth Circuit can be read

17

to find that.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

We address ourselves to it to show that Standard’s
objection is not substantial. There was overwhelming evidence
from which the jury could have found causation and it is not
a question of such importance that it needs to deter this
Court from addressing itself to the major issue and to
reinstating the burden.
Q

You are just anticipating an argument by Standard

that the cotirt should be affirmed on another ground?
18

1

A

I read fche brief, and I think if some of that

2

doesn’t come out here, i will be willing to be a bit redundant.

3

1 think the causation point was by far the most important
■
point expressed in the brief.

4
3
6

Q

So Standard also would like to have that question

settled, even if they lost on the initial question?

7

A

I am not precisely sure that Standard would like this ;

3

Court to do.

9

Q

’

1 think —-

What price level do you think Standard should have

10

sold Perkins in order to avoid violation of Section 2(a)?

11

The same price it sold to Signal?

12

A

Yes, sir.

13

Q

Is that because Perkins was a wholesaler?

14

A

Both Perkins and Signal were wholesalers in the

:

15
16

Pacific Northwest.
Q

Is that the reason why?

Your theory is that

17

Standard should have sold Perkins at the same price as Signal

18

because of that?

19

A

As I understand Section 2(a), unless you have other

20

reasons for discriminating, you sell to all direct purchasers

21

at the same price.

22

23

to sell to Perkins retail gasoline station at the same price

it sold to Signal which is solely a wholesaler and distributor?

would think it would probably be cost justified or —
Q

Unless it is cost justified, your theory is

that there is no place under 2(a) for any so-called functional
price difference?
A

Well, that really isn’t an integral part of our

argument because the question isn’t raised here.

Both Signal

and Perkins were operating on the same functional level.

They

were both wholesalers in the Pacific Northwest.
Perkins described himself as a wholesaler and there
was testimony of an expert marketing witness
Q

How much of Perkins’ purchases from Standard

did it sell to anybody other than itself?
A

Well, --

Q

Does the record show?

A

Well, Perkins sold to independent distributors.

He also sold to retail stations.

How much of it did it sell to anybody other

than its own gasoline stations?

verdict.

21

1

Q

Well then I suppose your theory has to be that the

2

element of causation here, the causation question is as

3

follows;

4

Stations was caused by the discrimatory low price at which

5

Standard sold to Signal which enabled Signal through Western

6

to supply Regal with gasoline at a price which enabled regal

7

to cut below Perkins' price,

That the damage suffered by Perkins Retail Gasoline

8

If you follow me, is that correct?

9

A

Your Honor, that puts most of it very concisely.

We do believe that there was substantial evidence which

10

i!

the jury — from which the jury could have found that the price

12

differential did go down through the distributive chain.
In view of the integrated nature of the chain we don'fc

13
14

believe that the jury had to trace the price at every level but

15

that question again is not necessarily presented because of

16

the substantial evidence to support your Honor's formulation,
Q

17
18

to Signal arid to Perkins, about how much was it?
A

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Can you illustrate the difference in price charged

this.

Well, the difference — there is some dispute as to
The price difference is admitted.

Standard contends

that the dispute amounted to between 45/1000ths of a cent, to
approximately 65/1000ihs of a cent per gallon,
Q

In the price charged to Signal on the one hand and

the price charged to Perkins on the other hand?
A

That is hundredths, I am sorry.
22

I had that wrong.

1

It was approximately a half a cent to approximately 7/10ths of

2

a cent*

3

to be added back into those figures which we pay, which would

4

increase them to approximately 8/10ths of a cent to a penny.

5

Q

We contend that at the very least a freight factor has

You mean to say that 2(a) requires a delivered price,

6

even if the gasoline is not sold on a delivered basis that

7

you have got to equalize them on the price, net price, to the

G

allegedly competing buyers on a delivered basis?

9
10
11
12

A

Well, your Honor, if comes up in this way.

The Portland-Vancouver area, under the evidence, is an
integral marketing area.
which is in Portland.

Standard's terminal is in Willbridge,

There was a price to Signal which lifted

13

at Willbridge and there was a price to Perkins which lifted at

14

Willbridge.

15
16
17

1G
19

21

22
23
24
25

The Berkins though had to transport his gasoline across
the river because his stations were in the Vancouver area,
within the same trading area, within the same relevant market,
but across the river.
That cost him approximately 3/10ths of a cent per gallon
of gasoline and Standard gave him an allowance for that.
But Standard deducts it allowance from his price.

We contend

that since he had to pay the freight anyway, there should be
no deduction from the price he paid Standard and, therefore,
the prices should be equalized at the price in Willbridge.
But there is an additional factor on this.
23

As Mr. Kintner

1

pointed out, there was evidence in the record that Signal

z

offered Perkins during this period a price which ranged from

3

75/lQ0ths of a cent to 8/10ihs of a cent better than the price

4

Standard offered Perkins and Standard at that time was supplying

5

all of Signal8s gasoline*

6

Mow the jury could have inferred from that, if you believe

7

respondent’s price discrimination figures that Signal was

8

selling to Perkins at a loss and was willing to do so, or the

9

jury could have believed that Signal was going to make a profit

10

on these sales, which would have meant that they would have

11

been getting a better price than either party had been able to

12

demonstrate*

13

The upper limit of it would not be able to be determined

14

on the record but the jury was certainly not bound to find that

15

the prices as set forth in thQ schedules and the amounts of

16

the differentials as set forth in the schedules were the only

17

prices.

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Beyond this, it is a very substantial — it comes to be a
lot of money.

Perkins sold over 20 million gallons of gasoline

during the claim period.

A ahalf a cent per gallon would have

been $100,000 which would have made a substantial difference
in his ability to remain viable.
During the time, during this period, Standard was giving
as I pointed out this lower price to Signal.

Standard also

was providing price assistance to its Branded Dealers who
24

I

1

competed with Perkins at retail<>

2

Now the Branded Dealers were independent operators of

3

Chevron and Signal stations, Signal stations being independent

4

of Signal Oil and Gas Company.

5

Signal Oil and Gas Company by Standard in the late 40's and

6

were operated as a division of Standard»

7

They were purchased from

Standard gave price assistance to those Branded Dealers,

8

both in Portland and located many miles distant from Portland»

3

The result was that the market went down even further and

10

stayed down, precisely because Standard was the price leader

11

in the area»

12

There is testimony in the record that when Standax'd

13

dropped its prices or raised its prices, other companies could

14

not long remain at equilibrium.

They have to go that way.

15

As one Shell dealer testified it was the Signal Branded

16

Dealer that he looked to and there were two retailers under-

13

effect and it was one which caused the market to stay down.

So this was a further depressing

Now the Ninth Circuit reviewed the facts underlying.

20

situation.

Northwest and that Perkins had demonstrated that those price

him causing his ultimate destruction.
Now petitioner was harmed in two ways,

He lost customers

and his sales declined.
He was selling gasoline as a minor.

Standard would not

permit him to testify, would not permit him to advertise that
he sold major brand gasoline.
The accepted major-minor differential was 2 cents.

At

times during the period involved here, Mr. Perkins was unable
to keep his price 2 cents below, unless he was willing to
absorb great losses.
He ended up 1 cent below the majors; he ended up even with

11

the Branded Dealers at times.

When he did that, he lost 3ales.

12

When he maintained the differential, he lost —■ when he main­
13

tained the differential, he lost profits on the sales he did
14
make; either way he was caught.
15

Perkins went to Standard during the period and asked for
IS
assistance.

He said he would be willing to take assistance at

17

the wholesale level eor the

t\me a ranted Signal in getting

18

the same price or else he would appreciate getting some
19
assistance comparable to that being received by the Branded
20
Dealers at the retail level.
21

Standard not only declined to give him the assistance,
22
they denied that they had been giving price assistance to the
23
Branded Dealers or that they had been discriminating in price
24

in favor of Signal.
25

26

i
2
3

As a result., Perkins received no help and he went out of
business.
Now, there was evidence before the jury and this is the

4

evidence that I referred to before as the evidence of passing

5

on — there was evidence before the jury that Signal wanted a

6

lower price from Standard precisely so that it could give that

1

lower price to its customers.

21

22

The price didn't just happen; it was negotiated and it was
negotiated at the behest of Signal.

Signal had Standard in

somewhat of a box because Standard was dependent on Signal's
crude oil to run its refineries.
So Signal kept insisting on a better price.

During those

negotiations the Signal negotiator, who was their marketing
vice president, pointed out that — and took the position that
unless he had a lower price he couldn't pass it on.
After he got the lower price, azid after Regal entered the
Portland area, two Standard executives acknowledged that Regal
had a better price than Perkins in the Pacific Northwest.
And they predicted that unless Standard did something to
a lleviate the situation, Regal would wreck that market, and
they were right.
Standard also knew of Perkins8 position.

Perkins had told

him that unless they helped him, not only was the market going
23

to be wrecked, but that he was going to be driven out of
24

business.

As he put it, he told them that he couldn°t live

1

under the existing arrangement»

z

be true.

And that, too, turned out to

He went out of business»

It is our feeling that there was substantial evidence

3

before the jury on which the jury could have based a finding

4

that it was the price discrimination in favor of Signal

5

stipported by the price assistance to the Branded Dealers which

6

proximately caused Perkins11 destruction; that the jury in short

1

could have inferred the same causal connection which Standard

8

executives had predicted»

9

The remaining issue is one of damages»

10

The evidence which I have discussed on causation proves

11

the requirement of legal harm»

12

Perkins was injured, he went

out of business, he lost sales and he lost profits»

13

And there was substantial evidence before the jury from

14

which the jury could have inferred the amount by which he was

15

injured, which is the remaining requirement that he must meet.

16

His evidence of damage included his business records for the
17

entire claim period, his purchase invoices for the claim
10

period, his sales invoices, lists of his lost customers,

19

mainly distributors»
20

It contained evidence of his decline in gallonage.
21

contained evidence that he could have increased his sales

ruled contrary to Perkins on one damage item.

13

there had been evidence improperly admitted as evidence of

i

19

The Ninth Circuit

•

This was a,lawsuit brought on behalf of Perkins as an
individual and two corporations he had formed to run his
business in the 508s.
The evidence demonstrated that Standard never recognized
the corporations and they dealt with Perkins independently.
But when the lawsuit was filed, Standard insisted that the
corporations bring the suit, and there were assignments in the
29

s
2

corporation suit in addition to Mr. Perkins.
In that context,, Mr. Perkins in trying to prove that he

3

had standing to sue as an individtiai and that he had suffered

4

legal harm? introduced evidence of these items of proof,

5

brokerage and the lost rentals.

6

He introduced in to prove that he had standing.

That

7

issue isn't in the case anymore because the District Judge

3

charged the jury that Mr. Perkins was a purchaser from Standard

9

and that is not contested.

O
1?

But that is how it came in.

Our answer to that point is

that the evidence was not introduced as evidence of damages,

12

that it was introduced as evidence of legal injury and that in

13

any event it could not have mislead the jury because it was

14
15
16

18

20
21

22
23
24

25

not included in Perkins damage computation exhibits nor was
it included in the Judge's detailed charge on damages as one
of the items which the jury might properly consider.
And just one final point, it is important, I think, that
Standard argued this point at great length in the Ninth Circuit,
the point on which the Ninth Circuit ruled adversely to Perkins,
cn the damage question.
cf it here.

But they don’t say a word in defense

Here they take a different tact and they suggest

that there are many other errors which preclude reinstatement
cf the verdict.
We discussed those in our reply brief, but it is our
position that none of those errors, the errors which the Ninth

30

1

Circuit didn't see fit to discuss, are of any greater substance

2

than the errors discussed in the reply brief and indeed that

3

our reading of the brief fails to disclose any significant

4

differences between the issues raised in the brief and the

5

issues in the specifications of errors.

S

More elaborate, but essentially the same questions.

We respectfully submit that this Court should reverse the

judgment of the Ninth Circuit and affirm the judgment of the
District Court.

19

20

Mr. MacLaury.

MR. MacLAURY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
At the outset, we emphasize that this is not a case of
predatory or widespread discriminations aimed by Standard at
eliminating a customer.
To the contrary, in the 1950!g, Petitioners and some four
or five other jobbers were important customers of Standard
in the Northwest.
These jobbers have accounted for a large percentage of

21

Standard's sales in that area, enabled Standard to gain access
22
to a market it could not otherwise reach.

And this was a

23
market comprised for people who simply don't buy major brand
24
gasoline,

They prefer to purchase minor brand gasoline from

25

31

\

2

the local dealer»
In these “circumstances there was absolutely no commercial

3

reason why Standard should wish to drive one of its own

4

customers from the market»

6

in the market»

Predatory pricing after all is

After all, when Perkins terminated his contract with
Standard, it was Union Oil Company of California whose gasoline
was sold to his stations, not Standards»
And certainly that was not a situation that Standard
sought to instigate»

And similarly, it was not in Standard's

interest to instigate widespread price wars that would cost
the company vast sums of money by way of price assistance to
its dealers»
This case involves three basic claims»
1»

The discrimination in price of the gasoline to Signal»

2.

The claim discriminations on the price of gasoline

to Standard's Branded Dealers,
3»

The Section 2(e) and 2(d) discriminations in favor

of Standard's Branded Dealers,
Now as to Signal, there are two claims.

Counsel so far

21

22

I believe has mentioned only one.
There was a claim in the Centralia-Seattle area and there

23
was a claim in the Portland-Vancouver area.

The facts are

24
that in 1955, Signal first purchased gasoline from Standard in
25
32

1

Seattle,

2

gasoline which Perkins purchased through Westway,

3

competed with Signal's customers# Harris and others# in

4

Seattle# but he competed with Westway gasoline# Union gasoline#

5

not Standard's gasoline.

Q

There

Perkins was buying gasoline# but it was Union's
And Perkins

Now some 80 miles to the South of Seattle is the small

7

town ©£ Centralia»

8

Carter,

9

one of its wholesalers and took this customer Carter away.

10

The facts are that neither Signal nor any of Signal’s

IQ
17

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

And there Perkins had a customer named

And it was claimed that Signal reached out through

customers ever sold any gasoline in Centralia.
Now the second market involving Signal is PortlandVancouver.

Signal commenced buying from Standard in Portland

in August of 1956.
Western

Signal resold all of this gasoline to

Hyway.

Signal# by the way# had absolutely no stock or ownership
connection with Standard.

Western Hyway was owned 60 percent

by Signal and the remaining stock was owned by Western’s
corporate officers.
Western sold all of its gasoline except for a minor
amount which is not pertinent to this lawsuit to three Regal
stations in Portland.

Those Regal stations were owned 55

percent in stock by Western and the remainder by persons having
no connection v/ith Western.
The important fact is that when Regal opened for business
33

1

in Portland in Septembers, Signal was paying Stan.da.rd a higher

2

price for gasoline than Perkins was paying.

3

in this lawsuit, from Septemberv 1956 to June of 1957, the

4

price paid by Western Hyway, Regal's supplier of gasoline, was

5

higher than the price paid by Regal,

6

1357,

And at all times

That was until June of

7

Q

The price paid by Regal?

8

A

The price paid by Regal — excuse me.

9

that, I misspoke myself.

If I said

The price paid by Western Hyway,

10

Regal's supplier for gasoline was higher than the price paid

11

by Perkins.

13
14
15

16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

That was no evidence in this case of the price paid by
Regal.
After November 1, 1957, Western's price was some 35/10,000
of a cent higher than the price paid by Perkins.
So the summary on Signal is that Signal never sold to
a retailer and Signal never sold through its wholesaler or
directly to any one in Centralia.
Q

Did Signal sell to anybody or offer to sell to

anybody that Perkins wanted to sell to?
A

No.

Were they in competitic n?

No, the situation in neither market was that

true, Mr. Justice.
The situation in Seattle was that Signal sold to one
B. F„ Harris, a jobber, the same as Perkins.

Perkins and B.F.

Harris in Seattle sought the business of one Carter, in Seattle.

Perkins gave the Portland market to Powell and Harris, his
cosigners, on the contract with Standard,

Secondly, Perkins

sold to distributors such as his nephew in Vancouver, and
sold to dealers who were tied to him by leases or to dealers
where he owned the retail stations.
And so there was never any competition between Signal and
Perkins for the business in question,

Well, not at Western* but how about generally?

A

Generally —-—

You mean if Perkins could have gotten some of Signal’s

customers, Perkins wouldn't have sold them?

Q

May I ask you -— I am a little confused by the

statements here — this lawsuit seems to be on the basis that
somehow Standard is selling to Signal and someone else x^ho
competes with Perkins or who competes with somebody that
Standard has originally sold the oil to, so it did suffer
damages.
I don't gather from you how they would suffer any damages
at all.

How it is possible.

A

Is that your idea?

Well, I don't believe — my position here, of course,

that Perkins did not suffer any damage whatsoever from
Standard's sales to Signal switching to the Portland market,
and to follow up your Honor's question, there the market was

18
19

20
21

structured this way;

Standard sold to Signal, Signal sold

to Western, Western sold to Regal, which was a retail outlet
Regal did in fact compete with some of the stations
supplied by Perkins across the river in Vancouver.

It was at

22
that level where we had the competition.

It was there where

23

there was head-to-head competition for the dollars of the same
24

customers.
25

38

8

Q

There was real competition?

A

There was real competition.

at the retail level.

We must acknowledge that •

And our whole point here and the only
!

4

real matter decided by the Court of Appeals, was that the

5

cause that competition which Perkins asserted injured him was

6

at the fourth level, and because Congress did not extend the

7

Robinson-Patman Amendments down to that fourth level, Perkins

0

was not entitled to recover here for any injury that may have

been caused to him by Regal, assuming that Regal did cause

Do I answer your question?
Q

I think so,

Q

You get a different result if you regarded the stock

j

ownership in Regal and Western, as being or creating sufficient
identification with Signal, wouldn't you?
A

Well, if 1 understand your Honor's question, my

answer would be this:

That because the operating people making

the operating decisions in Western, making the price decisions
in Western, owned 45 percent of the stock; because they were
making the decisions, I would expect these decisions to be
as much in the interest of these independents as it would be
in Signal.
Q

Well, maybe it would and maybe not because you had
I

55 percent of the stock of Western that was owned bv Signal,

j
is that right?
1
39

sI

1i

A

Well, it is sixty percent»

2

Q

Sixty percent.

3

And then how much of the stock of

Regal was owned by Western?

4

A

Fifty-five, your Honor,

5

Q

Fifty-five percent, so you had a chain of theoretical

S

control in e way, all the way down from Signal through Western

7

through the stations, and you, therefore, would, I assume, kind

3

of an independence of pricing judgment, but then one might not,

9

depending upon one's intellection, 1 suppose.

Or the facts, and Mr. Justice, I would like to pick

up the facts on that situation.
First, we go to the Court of Appeals finding that there
was no evidence in the record of operational control.

Then

we look at the invoices from Signal to Western and there is
every invoice, every sale representing every sale from Signal
to Western is in this record.
They are summarized at page 22 of our brief and they show
that the prices to Western were higher than the prices of
Standard to Perkins.

And so Signal, in other words, took that

price differential, of something less than a half of a cent
and put it in his pocket.
Q

Some people think that in those situations one might

suspect what is lost on peanuts is made up on the bananas.
Sometimes it works that way, too.
A

Yes, but I don’t understand how that could happen

25
40

here
Q

Because of the 55 percent ownership and depending

3

upon how just one aggregates all of the various interests

4

that enter into this common pool if you will regard it as

5

a common pool of ownership and financial interest.

6

is one of the sticky problems in this case.

ownership running from Regal to Western to Signal.
And here you do have that thread of more than majority
ownership that runs right through.

And the question is

what, if any, bearing, that should have on the intricate
problems presented by 2{a) in this situation.
A

I think Petitioner puts his finger right on it in

his brief.

When he states that the question of control, Mr.

Justice, is a question of fact.
Wow this fact, this issue, control, was never passed on
to the jury.

It was never submitted to the jury.

We suggested

an instruction which would ask the jury or instruct the jury
of one of the issues here, was whether or not this price
differential was passed on, and the court refused to give that
instruction.
Q

Let me see if 1 can get at your theory, which is what

24
I am trying to understand, and it is very simple illustration.
25
41

j

Suppose that Standard sold to Signal which resold to

1

a

stations, independent stations.

3

Standard sold to Perkins which resold to independent stations.

4

And let us suppose that Standard sold to Signal at a lower

5

price and let us suppose that the customer of Signal and of

6

Perkins were in the same competitive area,

of a violation of 2(a), depending on impact,
Q

15
16
17

that sort of a case?

20

And

The question whether

it is controlled to which we should look or a majority -- or
the extent of stock ownership as distinguished from operational
control.
I think that is one of the novel questions, as far as I
know it is a novel question,

that at least in degree that

this case presents.
A

21

22

That is one of the questions here.

I understand what you say about control.

10
IS

Right,

Now the question is, whether this is to be regarded as

12

14

Well, depending on whether the impact there would

probably be on the third level, but certainly a possibility

11

13

And let us suppose that

Of course, in every other field of the lav;, for

example some creditor’s rights, which is to attack the separate
corporate identities of two corporations, it is the burden

23
on the creditor to show that there is an alter ego situation
24
here, and I don’t see why the situation shouldn’t be the same
25
here.

42

1

As far as the fact that Signal owned a part of Western

z

and that Western owned a part of Regal, that would make no

3

difference whatsoever if there was, if each of these entities

4

did operate independently.

5

It would be exactly the same situation as though Standard

6

had sold to Signal and that Signal had sold to a completely

7

different independent entity and in turn it sold to a com­

Q

pletely independent entity.

3

The only question is a question of fact which the

10

Petitioner points out and there is no evidence to overcome

11

what I think the presumption should be was that these entities

12

were truly independent.

13
14

Q

Did the Court of Appeals by deciding it the way it

did at least implicitly decide that there was no control?
A

No, I think what the Court of Appeals --

Q

Well, they said

17

There was no evidence on it and they left that open

for retrial.

Q

They left that issue open for retrial.

But the Court of Appeals said that it doesn't

extend to the fourth line situations.
A

That is correct.

Q

Well, it wouldn't have been a fourth line situation

if there had been control.
A

That is correct.

I agree with that.

Q

And yet it reversed.

So it just said that there ■—
43

1

that unless the control was proved, the Act didn't reach this.

2

A

That is correct.

3

Q

It left open control, did it?

4

A

It left the question of control open and specifically

5

steited in response to the petition rehearing that that question

6

is open for retrial.

7

Q

At least they didn't decide it?

No, they couldn’t decide it.

Q

And without proving control they decided that this

was a fourth line situation not covered by the Act?
A
on 2(a)
Q

That is correct.

That is precisely the only holding

that the Court of Appeals made.
Well, now, would you say that the — and you say that

the effect on the line of commerce in which Perkins was engaged
is not in this case?
A

I don’t believe I understand your Honor's question.

Q

Well, the Court of Appeals said that 2(a) doesn't

reach this because it is fourth line.
A

Yes.

Q

And the petitioners say, "Well, the act says that

if there is an adverse effect on any line of commerce," now
what about the line of commerce which Perkins was engaged in?

23

So far as Van Camp is concerned, that case, that issue
was decided.

If there was a substantial lessening of compe­

tition on any level, -—
Q
A

That is right,
—— that case, that is the end of this lawsuit.

Now, to come back to your Honor8s other suggestion that
it was submitted to the jury, I don't agree with petitioner's
point of view on that at all.
I was in the trial of the case.

The case was never

focused on a general lessening of competition in the market.
It is perfectly true that ——
Q

Do you think it focused on showing a lessening of

competition with Regal?
A

Yes.

Q

That Regal cut prices and, therefore, competition

21

22
with it was lessened?
23

A

Yes.

The competition with Regal was lessened and

24

Perkins himself was injured rather than entire market.
25
45
t

Well, the instructions to the jury didn't focus on

1
2

that either.

3

A

Well, the instructions to the jury did focus on that,

4

in that it named very specifically the competitors of Perkins

5

who would be Regal, Signal,

Yes, but it didn't ask the jury to focus on saying

6
7

you must find that the competition with Regal was lessened.
A

to

were given in the alternative.

The jury was told that it must

find — and I am reading at the second line -- "that the
reasonable, probable effect of the discrimination may have been
to substantially lessen competition and then in the dis­
junctive or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce
or then Robinson-Patman to injury, destroy or prevent compe­
tition with Perkins of Oregon," et cetera.
You told Justice White, as I recall, that there was
no evidence that Signal controlled Regal?
A

There was no evidence that Signal controlled --How naive do you want us to be?

21

No, I have no quarrel with petitioner on this at all.

It appears that those instructions appears at page 54, they

There is a majority stock ownership.

What would you want to — what standard would you

have for control?

We have had cases here where one percent

of the stock ownership has been tantamount to control.

A

1

I don't think there is any question as the Court of

2

Appeals pointed out that Signal was in the position to control

3

Western,

4

But there was no interlocking directorates and there was no

demonstration of actual control,
1 am not saying for ©ns moment ——

Who controlled it?

The majority stock owner doesn't control it, who controlled

9

And that Western was in a position to control Regal,

it?
A

The officers of the corporation who are operating the

corporation control the corporation.
Q

And they are not elected by any stockholder's

meeting?
A

They are elected at a stockholder's meeting, techni­

cally speaking, yes.
But I think it is especially significant here that the
minority stockholders of Western were the operating officers

17

IS
19

and you would expect them as they did often operate that
company against the best interests of Signal when they were
purchasing gasoline from others than Signal and deprive Signal

20

of its wholesale profits ™
21

It comes to me a person who is not entirely ignorant

1 would assume that in the family of a nest of

c orporations you wouldn"t have to have any such things go
along as the top company wants them to go, or else there is a
change.
A

That assumption might be valid, Mr. Justice, but

here in this case we had quarrels between the owners of Signal,
the majority owners of Western and the Signal operating offices
as to where they would buy their gasoline and Western insisted
that they would buy their gasoline wherever they could get it
at a cheaper price, even though this deprived its parent of
its wholesale profits.
That would indicate to me a lack of control.

As I said

before, I am not assuming for a moment or suggesting for a
moment, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, Signal was in
a position to control, but there was no evidence that it did.
Q

But minority holders of Western, were in ---

They certainly weren't going to

did avoid it.
Going back to my argument, we have no disagreement here
that the original language of the Clayton Act extends to all
levels of competition.

Our point here is that this standard

was presented to the jury in the alternative.

Certainly the

standard of the Robinson-Patman Act provisions was a more or
less offered far less burden than the standard of the original
Clayton Act and one would expect that having the choice the
jury would make the decision on the basis of the more simpli­
fied and less onerous Robinson-Patman Amendments.

17

IS
19

But before the Court of Appeals, our objection here to
raising this problem here was not a technical one.
was not presented to the Court of Appeals.

The matter

It was not briefed

20

to the Court of Appeals.

The Court of Appeals never had an

21

opportunity to define this market either on a functional basis,
22
on a geographical basis.
23

There are other jobbers in the Northwest supplied by
24

competitors of Standard.

There was no showing of the impact

25

49

1

of Signal's operations on these other jobbers or on the retail

2

outlets of the other jobbers.

3
4
5
3
7

The only showing of the impact at all in an adverse
effect at all was on the competitor Perkins.
And that is the limit of the findings of these Court of
Appeals in

its footnote 6.

So, 2 don't disagree with the proposition of law, but my

8

only suggestion is that this court

has before it the abstract

9

question of whether or not the standard of the original Clayton

10

Act was limited to the fourth level, or to the third level, or

11

to the second level»

12

The answer to that is no.

Van Camp settled that.

There

13

isn't a record here that would support a holding that the

14

original Clayton Act should apply here in this case.

Q

Suppose Signal owned 100 percent of Western which

he still had no evidence of control in your sense, that is to

were otherwise the same.

at least on that point.

5

Q

I think you would, yes.

6

A

Otherwise we would get into, it seems to me, the

7

rule would be so vague, would it be 30 percent control, 50

8

percent control, 75 percent control, and despite these

9

percentages the factual situation may vary in each one of them.

10

Q

Usually 50 percent is considered as sort of a

dividing line, I mean a clear dividing line.

12

percent or less than that may also be significant, but 50

13

percent is usually considered pretty significant.

you those questions of mine, because that if that may be, I

18

A

One other aspect of the fourth level point that we

have here, there is no question at all, that the plain language

cf the Robinson-Patman Amendments, limits the impact to the

21

third level.

that Standard was selling any line which carried this through

certainly I think it is the purpose of the Robinson-Patman

But within that broad policy,

on the same pricing level»
Yes,

So that, they can start off at an equal start»

And

Congress, in order to accommodate itself to the broader view
of law should have competitive pricing and bargaining of
pricing, restrict it, the regional Robinson-Patman so that
it declared a price difference, price differential, only where
there was a lessening of competition at one of these three
levels.
Q

Now suppose, however, that there was a business

contrivance arranged.
A

Yes.

Q

Where there was really no business difference between

the levels and it was just simply the same company selling
right straight through without any levels»

What about that?

I have no problem with that at all, your Honor»

think that would be a situation that would be a violation of

the Rdbinson-Patman Act.

You say that that was not shown.

A

I say that that was not shown and that was not the

situation here and in fact the evidence tended to show just

the other way.

Q

Well, if the jury followed its instructions, it

wouldn't have found for the plaintiff on the basis that

8

competition with Regal had been lessened, would it?

A

I think it did, yes.

Q

It must not have followed its instructions then.

basis of control, and if it followed the evidence there was
a Standard, Signal, Western, Regal.
A

Yes.

Q

And all the instructions to it said was that it got as

far as Western but stopped there?
A

That is correct.

Q

If it followed its instructions then the only way

it could have reached the result it did was by going on the
line of commerce?
A
problem.

No, I don't think that the jury understood this
We had asked the court at the trial level to submit

23

to the jury the question whether the price differential,
as small as it was, was passed down to Regal.

The court refused to give that instruction.

The court

2

instructed the jury, contrary to our request? that Perkins

and Signal were competitors.

was to take that instruction, assume that Perkins was injured

5

and assume that it was as a result of the price to Signal.
Q

And

think that the jury did,

So you think there was — so you think that the jury
