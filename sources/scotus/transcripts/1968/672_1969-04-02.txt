ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM D. RUCKELSHAUS, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUCKELSHAUS:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case involves the applicability of the declarator,,

9
10

judgment statute to the Court of Claims.

11

Court of Claims was that the declaratory judgment statute, the

12

Federal declaratory judgment statute, was applicable in this

13

case.

14

15
16

The decision of the

A statement of the facts of this case, I think, would
be in order, in order to set the stage for this decision.
Col. King, who was the respondent in this case, on

17

May 14, 1959 was found physically unfit for active duty by the

13

Army Physical Evaluation Board.

19

was reviewed by the Army Physical Review Council, and that body

20

found King fit for duty.

,

2

22
23
24
25

On June 18, 1959 this decision

The latter decision was upheld by the Army's Physical
Disability Appeal Board on July 21, 1959, and King was retired
for longevity on July 31, 1959.
In August of 1959, King filed an application for cor­
rection of military records with the Army Board for Correction
2

of Military Records.

A hearing was held inJJanuary of 1961, and

the application was formally denied by the Under Secretary of
the .Army on May 19, 1961.
That ended King's procedure in the Army appeal boards.
On July 26, 1965 respondent King filed a petition in the Court
of Claims alleging that the action of the Under Secretary of
the Army was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, and
demanded judgment in an amount, equal to the taxes paid on his
retirement since 1959. The difference between retiring for
longevity and for disability was that he would have been paid
75 percent of his full pay as a Colonel in both instances, ex~
cept that if he had been retired for disability, he would not
have had to pay any taxes on that retirement pay.
Q

It is wholly exempt from taxes, is it?

A

Yes, that is right, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Q

If it is disability retirement.

A

Pursuant to the Government's motion to dismiss

and in affirmative defense, the Court of Claims dismissed respon
dent King's petition on the grounds that the petiton was basic
ally a claim for a tax refund, and since King had failed to
file a refund with the Internal Revenue Service, he wap barred
from asserting it in this suit pursuant to 26 U.S.C, 7422(a).
The court further stated, on its own motion, that the
only basis for maintaining this action was under the Declaratory
judgment Act, and gave plaintiff King, respondent King in this
3

1

case, 30 days to file a brief on the applicability of the

2

Declaratory Judgment Act to the Court of Claims.

3

After briefs were filed, the court ruled on February

4

16, 1968 that the Declaratory Judgment Act did apply to the

5

Court of Claims, and further, the court gave King 30 days to

6

amend his petition and seek a "declaration of his right to be

7

retired for disability and to have his military records changed»

8
9
1C

It was from this order of the Court of Claims that
the Government has sought, and this Court granted certiorari to
the court below.

11

Now, this case, in its broadest sense, I think, in-

12

volves the question of whether the power and the authority of

13

the Court of Claims should be appreciably increased with refer­

14

ence to the suits against the United States without any addi­

15

tional grant of power or authority from Congress.

16
17

I think specifically the question before the Court is
whether the Court of Claims in this case, or indeed, in the

18

broader sensa, in any case, has the jurisdiction or power to

19

enter declaratory judgments, and I might say that the Court of

20

Claims for the first time is saying that cases which have a

21

money cast, or which are money related, or which are money

22

oriented, confers jurisdiction upon that court to grant declara­

23
2/

25

tory judgments.
I think at the outset, it can be stated that it is
agreed on the part of the Government and on the part of responde it

1

and amicus that the declaratory judgment statute itself confers

2

no jurisdiction on the Court of Claims or, indeed, on any court

3

by its own terms.

4

a United States Court to declare a right within its jurisdiction

5

so the jurisdiction for this Court of Claims to enter this de~

S

claratory judgment had tc be found somewhere else.

I think the statute speaks of the power of

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM D. RUCKELSHAUS, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

8

MR. RUCKELSHAUS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

9

When the Court adjourned, the argument had just been

10

put forward that there was no dispute betxveen the petition and

11

the respondent and the amicus, or the court below for that

12

matter, as to whether the declaratory judgment statute itself

13

conferred any jurisdiction on the Court of Claims to hear or

14

to have the application of the declaratory judgment statute

15

apply to that court, because the statute itself says that they

16

only have the power or right to declare rights within its juris­

17

diction, so that phrase "within its jurisdiction” means they

18

must find this jurisdictional grant somewhere other than the

19

declaratory judgment statute itself.

20

Where the respondent and the court below looked to

21

find that jurisdiction is. in the Tucker Act.

22

by its terras, according to the court below, in the opinion in

23

the appendix on page 32, the court said that Mr. King could seek,

24

declaratory relief, even though he was "unable to obtain or re­

25

quest a money judgment.”
&

The Tucker Act,

The court then went on to say that the Tucker Act

1

a

granted, judgment in a case of this nature because of the money

3

cast, or money orientation, or money relatedness of the claim.

4

It is the contention of the Government that this flies

5

in the face of the traditional grant of jurisdiction to the

&

Gourt of Claims.

1

and years of decisions that have been handed down restricting

8

that jurisdiction to claims in which a money judgment could be

9

awarded„

10

It flies in the face of the years of statutes

This Court itself, in Glidden versus 2danok, said that

11

from the beginning, it, meaning the Court of Claims, "From the

!2

beginning it has been given jurisdiction only to award damages,

13

not specific relief."

14

I think that the argument of the Court of Claims below

IS

seeking to restrict this jurisdictional grant, or broaden this

16

jurisdictional grant into areas where there was a money cast,

17

or money orientation, or money relatedness, again flies in the

18

face of this statement from Glidden versus Zdanok.

19

\

Now, the court below originally dismissed this action

20

on the grounds that it was a claim for a tax refund, and said

21

that since the plaintiff, the respondent herein, had not filed

22

a tax refund claim pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7422(a), that the court

23
24
25

had no jurisdiction.
Then the court invited the plaintiff to file a declara,
fcory judgment, and the plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment,

7

]

alleging essentially the same things in -- or filed a brief in

2

favor of filing a declaratory judgment --- and when eventually

3

it amended the petition, the plaintiff asked for essentially

4

the same thing that he had asked for in his original petition,

5

the only difference being that it was phrased in terms of a

6

declaration of his rights.

7

I don't see how the Court of Claims can be said to

8

have expanded its jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment

Q

Act simply because the claim itself, as filed, or the petition

W

10

as filed, was stated in a different.

it

the petitioner was seeking, the plaintiff was seeking herein,

12

was pretty much the same thing that he was seeking under his

13

original claim.

14

Really, the relief that

I think the question of whether it is a tax question

IS

or not, the original petition as filed, really does not concern

16

this Court because if the claim as originally filed was a tax

17

question, if it was a petition to recover tax money, then clearly

18

the court is without jurisdiction to entertain this under the

19

Declaratory Judgment Act, because the Declaratory Judgment Act

20

specifically precludes suits with respect to taxes.

21

22
23

Q

Didn't Judge Davis say the real question was the

Army regulations, and not the Revenue Code?
A

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall, he did say that the

24

real question was the Army regulations, but I think he was forced

25

to make that statement because he had already ruled prior to

1

that time that this was essentially a tax refund claim, and so

2

if he said that it had to do with the eventual tax refund, then

3

he would be faced with the same section of 28 U.S.C. 7422 that

4

he had dismissed it on previously.
If he then turns around and says, as he did on the

5

6

last page of his opinion, that the only question before the court

7

below is the question of whether this man was properly retired,

8

then I think he loses the money cast, or money orientation, or

9

money relatedness of this claim which he says is necessary in

t

10

order to confer jurisdiction on that court.

the court had to do with whether the man was properly retired
Q

He didn’t say "sole".

He said "controlling8' „

I

have forgotten what his phrase was.
A

It is the last part of his opinion.

He said the

question before the court in the declaratory judgment action tha .
was filed, he said on page 40 of the appendix, "The only question
he presents or need present relate to his retirement from the
Army, and those are the only issues with which this court will
treat in its further proceedings in this case."
I think once he has said that, he has lost his argu­
ment that conferred the jurisdiction in the first place that
this case had a money cast to it, or money orientation.

I don’t

1

think it is enough that you can say somewhere in the future, way

2

down the line, the petitioner herein may be entitled to some

3

money.

in any court.

This, I believe, would include virtually every case filers

Q

5

Why is it that he couldn’t have said in the Court

6

of Claims,

7

They put me in the wrong category, and by reason of that mis­

8

take , I am out some money and the United States owes me that

9

money for having caused me to pay it out when I shouldn’t have"?

10

"The United States made a mistake in retiring me.

What is wrong v/ith that claim?

11

A

12

Q

You think that is just a tax refund claim?

13

A

That is what the court below held in its original

14

Mr. Justice White, I think the original reason --

order to dismiss.
Q

15

I know, but if he says, "If I were in the right

16

category, why, if I were retired in the right category, of

17

course I owe those taxes, and as long as that classification

18
19

20

2!
22
23
24
25

stands, I did owe the taxes, but I want to get rid of the classi­
fication and I certainly can't do it in a tax refund suit.

No­

body would even listen to me in a tax refund suit to review the
classification question.

This is the only place I can go to havjs

this classification reviewed.

This is what is costing me the

money."
Why would that be thrown out as a tax refund claim or
as beyond the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims?
10

I

A

I think on the basis of Prince against the United

2

States, Mr» Justice White»

3

similar fact situation herein in which Prince had filed a peti­

4

tion for a tax refund with the Internal.Revenue Service before

5

bringing his suit to determine whether he was properly retired,

6

and on the basis of that case, which the Government does not

7

completely accept, by the way, the Court of Claims then went

8

ahead and decided Prince’s case»

9
10

1

?

The court therein entertained a very

In this instance, King did not file a petition for a
tax refund»
Q

Do you think in a tax refund suit, an ordinary

12

tax refund suit, this officer could have litigated the correct­

13

ness of his retirement?

14

A

I don’t believe that he could have had the deter­

15

mination made by the Internal Revenue Service as to whether he

16

was properly retired or not.

17

Q

Or in that kind of a suit.

18

A

Well, in Prince against the United States, Mr.

19

Prince did just that.

20

he was properly retired —

21

22
23

24
25

He had his determination as to whether

A

In the tax refund suit in the Court of Claims.

Q

In the Court of Claims, yes, but how about -- the

Internal Revenue Service said, "We won’t look at that.
owe the tax.'8

You just

Could he get it adjudicated in a District Court,
11

1

2

do you think?
A

Well, if Prince is a proper holding, and as 1 say

3

we have some question about that, I don't see any reason why he

4

couldn't, because District Courts have concurrent jurisdiction

5

in tax refund claims„

6

*

In addition to that, I think that clearly King could

7

hcive brought a mandamus action against the Secretary of the Army

8

under 28 U.S.C. 1361 and requested a mandate against the Secreta: ty

9

of the Army to change his records pursuant to an arbitrary and

10

capricious decision made by the Secretary of the Army,

11

he could have gotten such a suit in a District Court or could

12

have gotten such relief in a District Court.,

13

I think

He did not seek such relief in a District Court.

14

Clearly, he could not get that relief in the Court of Claims be­

15

cause there are cases specifically holding that mandamus does

16

not lie, although I think in this case what the Court of Claims

17

is, in effect, doing is doing indirectly what they can't do

18

directly, that is, by declaring the rights of King, in effect

19

mandating the Secretary of the Army to change his records.

20

Certainly if King then went into a District Court

21

against the Secretary of the Army, the decision as to whether he

22

was proper retired, the doctrine of collateral estoppel would hav

23

applied to those issues in the District Court.

24
25

So I think King had some additional remedies here in
the one that he tried, but he chose this method in the Court of
12

:

1

Claims at the invitation of the Court of Claims.

2

Q

I don't see your Prince case cited in your brief.

4

A

I believe it is, Justice Black.

S

Q

I don't see it in the index.

6

A

It is cited on page 2 of Justice Davis8 opinion,

3

7

Is it?

Mr. Justice Black.

8
9

It is 127 Court of Claims 612.

I think the argument that is advanced by the respondent
having to do with the legislative history of the Declaratory

10

Judgment Act and of the 1948 recodification of that Act has very

11

little to do with the determination of whether the Court of

12

Claims has jurisdiction over this case in the first instance.
I think the most that can be said for their legislative

13
14

history argument is that you can show from this history that

15

Congress did not even consider the Court of Claims in enacting

16

the declaratory judgment statute, and that I would emphasize to

17

the Court that we are not saying that the declaratory judgment

18

statute specificaly excluded the Court of Claims from its opera­

19

tion.

20

dent here, that the Government insists that the declaratory judg­

21

ment statute specifically excludes the Court of Claims.

22

not insist that.

!3
4
;5

I think this is the thrust of the argument of the respon­

We do

I think that what we do say is that before the United
States Government consents to be sued, or before sovereign im­
munity is waived, there must be a clear and express statement of
13

1

that waiver on the part of Congress, and that there is no such

2

clear and express statement either in the declaratory judgment

3

statute or in the Tucker Act, and without such a clear, express

4

statement, the argument that sovereign immunity has been waived

5

in this case simply cannot stand up.

S

Q

What language in the Tucker Act operates as a

7

waiver of immunity by the United States to the extent you con­

3

cede the United States waived it?

9

A

The Tucker Act states, in its jurisdictional

10

statement, "The Court of Claims shall have jurisdiction to render

11

judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either

12

upon the Constitution or any Act of Congress or any regulation

13

of an Executive department, or upon any express or implied con­

14

tract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated

15

damages in cases not sounding in tort."

16

I think the language that expressly waives it is where

17

the Tucker Act says to "render judgment upon any claim."

18

the Tucker Act was passed, the reason for the Tucker Act itself

19

was the fact that Congress had been inundated with private bills

20

that took up a good percentage of their time, and they wanted

21

this decision to be made by another court.

22

jurisdiction of that court has been limited to hearing claims

23
24

25

When

So traditionally the

for money damages.
Q

You think then if Congress just amended this

statute, the Tucker Act, and said the Court of Claims shall also

14

1

have jurisdiction to adjudicate declaratory judgment actions

2

related to money claims, that would be a waiver?

3
4
5

6
7

S

A

I think that would be clear enough, Mr» Justice

Q

What did the Declaratory Judgment Act itself

White.

realy say the way it is?
A

The Declaratory Judgment Act simply says that any

court of the United States has the right to adjudicate —

9

Q

Has jurisdiction»

10

A

Within its jurisdiction»

1!

jurisdictional terms.

12

Q

13
14

It didn't speak in

It was a creation of additional remedy»

Wc*ll„ it did speak of cases otherwise within its

jurisdiction, didn't it?
A

Within its jurisdiction is what it said? that a

15

court could issue a declaratory judgment in a case or contro­

16

versy within its jurisdiction, and in this, I think that means

!7

you must find the jurisdictional grant in some statute other

18

than the declaratory judgment statute»

19

Claims and the respondent herein is seeking to find that juris­

20

dictional grant in the Tucker Act.

21

22
23
24
25

Q

That is why the Court of

Before the Declaratory Judgment Act, what was

wrong with declaratory judgments?
A

I think the primary question was one of rightness

Prior to the Declaratory Judgment Act there were many
Q

Was it a jurisdictional question?
15

1

A

It had to do with rightness of a claim.

There

2

were many purposes, but it was primarily to decide controversies

3

between private individuals that had not reached the degree of

4

rightness in which a suit could normally be brought, and that

5

someone did not need to act at their peril„ did not need to

6

avoid acting for fear of the consequences when they could get

7

their right determined in advance of having to act.
I think that was the original purpose of the declara­

8

9

tory judgment statute.

10

Q

It is your position that there wasn't a juris­

11

dictional problem about issuing, no case or controversy problems

12

about -—

13

A

I think that there were problems of rightness and

14

problems of whether the controversy had ripened enough to be

15

determinable by a court or justiciable by a court, and that priofr

16

to the enactment of the declaratory judgment statute, many cases

17

were dismissed for being premature, and that many activities on

18

the part of private individuals were inhibited because they

19

could not get their rights determined prior to the time that

20

they acted.

21

Q

22
23
24
25

So you say the Declaratory Judgment Act didn't

help the Court of Claims in declaratory judgment situations be­
cause that kind of a claim wasn't otherwise within its juris­
diction in the first place.
A

I think that is right.
16

1

Q

Because of the lack of waiver,

2

A

Because there has to he a waiver somewhere, a

3

consent to be sued, and all that the Congress has ever consented

4

in this area was that the United States could be sued in the

5

Court of Claims for money damages.

6

Q

For ripe claims.

The consent goes for money

7

damage suits, but only if the claim is sufficiently ripe. Don't

8

you have to limit this concept?

9

A

I think it goes further than that, because if you

10

are to say that the Court of Claims has the power to grant de~

11

claratory judgments in areas where the claim is not ripe, this

12

means that under the general grant of the Tucker Act to deter-

13

mine controversies regarding government regulation, this amount

14

to a considerable increase in power in the Court of Claims„

13

whether you call that an additional remedy <?r additional juris­

16

diction that it does not otherwise have.

17

Q:

As I understand your position, you do not claim

18

that the Declaratory Judgment Act, on its face, in speaking of

19

the courts of the United States, excluded the Court of Claims.

20

A

That is right.

21

Q

That within the word "courts" is included the

22

Court of Claims, but the Act doesn't give the Court of Claims

23

the privilege of doing something it wasn't doing before because

24

it didn't have jurisdiction to do so, to issue declaratory judg­

23

ments because of lack of consent of the United States.

17

1

2
3

Where does the consent of the United States stop in
the Tucker Act?
A

I think it stops when somebody goes into the

4

Court of Claims and requests something in addition to a money

5

judgment or other them a money judgment.

6

Q

You mean asks for a declaration about a money

7

judgment, but the money judgment isn't ripe enough, the money

a

claim isn't ripe enough?

9

A

I think the problem is basically one as a problem

10

between jurisdiction and remedy.

When we are talking about

11

sovereign immunity, we can get into a semantic argument over

12

whether the Declaratory Judgment Act simply created a. new remedy

13

Congress ever intended for them to do.

19

Where a court is exercising considerably more power

20

than they did in the past, under a court decision, as regards

21

the United States, before they do that there has to be a clear

consent on the part of the United States to be sued, and in this

case there was not such a consent and there was not such a waiver

of sovereign immunity.

ARGUMENT OF NEIL B. KABATCHNICK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KABATCHNICK;

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the
21

1

Court s

2

It is the respondent's position that the decision be­

3

low holding that the Declaratory Judgment Act does apply to the

4

United States Court of Claims was correct, and that the decision

5

below should be affirmed.

6

The considerations before the Court revealing the

7

correctness of the decision below is readily apparent from an

8

examination of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2201,, the Declaratory

9

Judgment Act, and 23 U,8,C. 451,

10

As. the Court is aware, the Declaratory Judgment Act

11

says in pertinent part that any court of the United States, in

12

an actual controversy within its jurisdiction, may declare the

13

rights and other legal relations of the parties, whether or not

14

further relief is or could be sought.

15

Of

course,

the key

word,

from respondent's point of

16

view, is the word "any";

17

Court will recall that in the original Declaratory Judgment Act

18

passed in 1934, the language of the Act was "the courts of the

19

United States," and in the recodification in 1948, the language

20

was changed to read "any court of the United Statas."

21

22
23
24
25

"any” court of the United States,

The

It would seem that on its face, without going beyond
the bounds of Section 2201, an examination of that language, or
that phraseology, would readily cause ayyone to come to the con­
clusion that the Declaratory Judgment Act does apply to the
United States Court of Claims.

22

1

Q

What about the Tax Court?

2

A

Sir, I find nothing, following ray theory, if it

3

is correct, in going to the provisions of Section 451, and the

4

terra "court of the United States" as defined there.

S

Court is not specifically identified within the language of

8

Section 451.

The Tax

7

Q

Does it coma under the terms "any court"?

8

A

As a court of the United States, 1 would think

9
lO-

ll

that it is, but it is not expressly identified within Section
451.
Q

Well, it is not covered by the definition, is it,

12

because there is a catch-all at the end, "any court created by

13

Act of Congress, the Judges of which are entitled to hold office

14

during good behavior."

IS

years, not during good behavior, so it would not be included.

Tax Court judges serve for-a term of

16

Q

What about the Court of Customs Appeals?

17

A

Yes, sir? if respondent’s theory is correct, it

18

would apply to the Court of Customs Appeals, which is expressly-

19

stated in Section 451 as being within the term "court of the

20

United States."

21

22
23
24

25

As 1 indicated earlier, if it was believed that we
would have to go outside the bounds of Section 2201 to find a
definition of the terra "court of the United States," as respon­
dent has pointed out, we could go to Section 451 of Title 28,
which defines "court of the United States," and within that
23

I ,
2
3

definition, of course, there is the designation of the Court of
Claims in express language»
I believe it is significant that at the time of the

4

original passage of the Declaratory Judgment Act in 1934, in manjf

5

of the decisions holding that the Act did not apply to the Unite

6

States, the express statutory definition of a "court of the United

7

Statas" was not contained explicitly in the Judicial Code»

8
9

Therefore, I believe the Court need not go beyond an
examination of the terms of Section 2201 and Section

451

to find

10

express language indicating that the Declaratory Judgment Act

11

does apply to the United States Court of Claims.

12

Now, considerable discussion was made of the; matter

13

of the waiver of sovereign immunity, which would permit the

14

United States Court of Claims to apply that procedural remedy

15

in proceedings within its jurisdiction,,

16

1491, the Tucker Act, is the waiver of sovereign immunity, is

17

the statute which permits the United States Court of Claims to

18

apply the procedural remedy accorded by the Declaratory Judgment

19

Act to proceedings within its jurisdiction»

20

I submit that Section

As the Court held in the Aetna Life Insurance Company

21

versus Haworth, at 330 U»S» 227 in 1937, the operation of the

22

Act is procedural only»

23

said, "It does not enlarge the rang® of remedies»

24

expand the jurisdiction of the Court.”

25

As the Court in the Skelly Oil case
It does not

I think it is quite significant, in assessing the
24

i

merit of the decision of the court below* that the court, and

2

respondent respectfully invites the Court's attention to the

3

language in the Shelly Oil case, where the Court said that be­

4

fore the Declaratory Judgment Act, a Federal Court would, enter­

5

tain a suit on a contract only — and this was a contract action

G

if the plaintiff asked for an immediately enforceable remedy,

7

like money damages or an injunction.

8

9

The Court went on, at pages 671 and 672, to say "The
Declaratory Judgment Act allowed relief to be given by way, of

10

recognising the plaintiff's right, even though no immediate en­

11

forcement of it was asked.”

12

I think this is the essence of the holding of the

13

court below.

14

Ruckelshaus8 argument, that examination of the order entered on,

15

I believe, February 10, 1967,

16

I believe at page A12, that the Court of Claims did not dismiss

17

the respondent's original petition and did not dismiss it on

18

the grounds that it was a tax refund case.

19

I would like to point,out, in connection' with Mr.

which is set out in the appendix,

The Court said that so far as it appeared at that timej

20

it appeared that the only possible basis under which the action

21

could be maintained, was under the Declaratory Judgment Act.

22

Leave was given to file briefs and argue the matter and the

23

matter was argued, and ultimately the court rendered the deci­

24

sion below that is before the Court for consideration today, so

25

the court did not dismiss the action below as a tax refund case.
25

'i

I think it is extremely significant here to under­

2

stand , and there are some intricacies, the operation and theory

3

of respondent's case below.

4

Respondent has persistently, as the record in this

3

case shows, and the'briefs below, and the briefs hare, that this

6

is not a tax refund case.

physical disability retired pay, which but for the action of

8

the Secretary of the Army before July 31, 1959, the date of re­

9

Respondent’s claim is a claim for

10

administrative relief, that the respondent would have been paid

11

physical disability retired pay, the gross amount of which is

12

the same, 75 percent, whether by disability retirement or by

13

longevity.

14

ability on July 31, 1959, he would have received 75 percent, the

15

total amount due him, his basic pay provided by statute.

18

However, if he had been retired for physical dis­

If he had been retired, as he was here, for longevity,

17

as, and it happens here, to be income tax.

19

was deducted by operation of law

Now, the respondent went to the Army Board for Cor­

20

rection of Military Records, under 10 U.S.C. 1552, in August of

21

1959, asking that his records be corrected to show that he was

22
23
i 24
25

retired by reason of physical disability.

As pointed out, and

I would particularly and respectfully invite the Court’s atten­
tion to the subject matter of Footnote 4 on page 4 of respon­
dent’s brief, where the respondent

26

has endeavored to specifica! ly

3

identify what would have happened tod his records beer?, corrected

2

If the respondent’s records had been corrected in

3

1961, pursuant to his application, his records, by operation of

4

law, under 10 U.S.C, 1552, would have bean corrected to show thac

S

he was retired by reason of physical disability.

6

not for one second would the respondent, by operation of lav;

7

under 1552, ever have been deemed to have been retired for

3

longevity.

9

the Department of the. Army, would have been corrected to show

In other words

His records would have been, and all records of

10

that, for all times, for all purposes, he had been retired by

n

reason of physical disability.

12

As a result of such a correction of the records, as

13

respondent has endeavored to point out in this footnote, the

14

Department of the Army, under 10 U.S.C. 1552(c), by that statute,

15

from current applicable appropriations of that Board, the

16

Department of the Army funds would have been used to pay the

17

full 75 percent, or that amount that would have been due him

18

would have been paid out of Army appropriations.

19

Evidence of this is indicated, of how this operates,

20

in the Darby case, Darby versus the United States, which respon­

21

dent has cited in the footnote below.

22
23

Q

You say the amount in this footnote would coin­

cidentally have equaled the amount of taxes withheld.

24

A

Yes, sir.

25

Q

It is not coincidentally.

27

It is because that is

the difference, isn't it?

2

A

That is the actual

3

Q

It is not coincidence.

A

My choice of words might have been poor.

Q

But you mean it comes out Army appropriations ,

6
7

and not out of whatever source an ordinary tax refund comas from,
A

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

It is on this theory

8

that respondent below filed this action for physical disability

9

retired pay.

10

I might point out also that if this were deemed a tax

11

refund case, it was respondent9s position below, and respondent9 =3

12

position here, that going to the tax and making an application

13

for tax refund would be a futile gesture on the part of respon™

14

dent, because the Commissioner of Internal Revenue does not have

IS

jurisdiction to assess whether or not this man was physically

16

disabled at the time of his retirement in 1959.

I do not think, that possibly the court would even

That

14

I believe in the petitioner’s brief, in their state­

15

ment of the facts, on page 3, they mention subsequently, but I

16

notice that Mr. Ruckelshaus corrected this in his narration of

18

20
21

22
23
24
23

the chronology of what the administrative processes were in the
court below.
Q

And you fully exhausted them.

A

Yes, air.

Q

There is no issue about that between you.

A

No.

All the available remedies have bean ex­

hausted, and the proceedings of the Army Board for Correction oi
Military Records are, of course, in the appendix.
But I think that basically, getting back, I think, to

31

1

the basic question here,

2

451 are clear that the Act does apply as far as waiver of

I think that the language of 2201 and

I 3
sovereign immunity«, that this is carried forth or shown by 1491.
Q

4

I suppose it is your position that if the Govern­

5

ment says that the statute says that sovereign immunity is

6

waived with respect to this category of claims against the

7

United States , then that is a waiver that opens the door to what

8

ever remedy a court may apply»

9

A

10

Q

Is that your position?

Yes,sir.
Now, on the other hand, I suppose the argument is

11

that the United States waived sovereign immunity, but only for

12

purposes of permitting a judgment for money5

13

poses of obtaining declaratory relief.

and not for pur­

14

A

That is my understanding.

15

Q

And your position is that once the Government has

16

waived sovereign immunity with respect to a particular subject

17

matter, the restriction on the form of action is of no conse­

18

quence.

19

20
21

22
23

24
25

A

As to form of action, Justice Fortas, it would be

of consequence, but I am thinking of the language describing
what a declaratory proceeding is, that it is not a proceeding
in equity or at law, but sui generis. It has also been described
as a procedural remedy.

As a remedy, I think that you, of

course, must have the basic consent, in particular statutes such
as the Suits in Admiralty Act —

32

Q

1

Well, that is really the issue here, it seems to j

2

me*

3

of jurisdiction*

I am not sure that I am helped by talking about it in terms
But the question may be whether the waiver of
;

4
5
6

.

sovereign immunity in the statute, which is a consent to be sued;
for money judgments, also operates as a consent to be sued in aI
declaratory judgment action.
A

7

.8
9
10

M
12

13
14

It would be respondent’s position, Justice Fortas ,

that where you have a consent to sue, such as in the Tucker Act,
which gives you the jurisdictional relief to proceed to judicial
relief, that this waiver in the Tucker Act does accord the claim­
ant the right to seek declaratory relief as the form of action
or as an incidental portion of his claim, of his monetary claim,
and as was stated in the Pennsylvania Railway Company, as a pro­
cedural step to the accomplishment or the achievement of the
receipt, or to be put in the position, I believe, was one of the

15

16

phrases that Judge Davis used below, to be pit in the position
\

to have his right to have a judicial statement of his right to
17

the claim or a recognition of his right to a monetary c3.aim®
18
Q

19
20

In short, a declaratory judgment.

Well, I am

sure, it would seem to me, you would have to take that position,
because it seems to me that, involved In this case are two ques- j

21

tions;

One, does the declaratory judgment statute make avaii-

22

.

able, as a matter of theory, that sort of instrumentality, that
23

sort of remedy, to the Court of. Claims»
2,4

it does.

25
33

Your argument is that

1

1 have listened to that , and read what you have to

2

say in your brief , but the next question is, whan the United

3

States consented to be sued in the Court of Claims by way of an

4

action for money judgment, does that consent to be sued also

5

extend to a consent to be sued for a declaratory judgment in the

6

Court of Claims in this type of situation?

7

A

I might, in response to the second portion of

8

your question --- of course, the first portion, Justice Fortas,

9

my answer is yes, our position is that the Act does apply.

10

As to whether the consent, as I understand your ques­

11

tion, also gives leave to not only seek monetary relief, but also

12

declaratory relief, my answer to that would also be in the affir­

13

mative for this reason:

14

act of establishing the Court of Claims in 1855, and the 1863

15

statute, of course, we did not have the concept of declaratory

16

relief, and also, of course, when the Tucker Act was passed in

17

1887 we didn’t have that.

18

When the Tucker Act, or when the first

We didn’t have that until 1934.

I believe that talcing the history of the Declaratory

19

Judgment Act, and the Tucker Act, and of course when the Congress

20

passed the Tucker Act they didn't envision declaratory relief.

21

22
23
24
25

This is an advent of comparatively recent vintage.

I think lockr­

ing in retrospect,- especially when it says "any claim,," it does
not say a claim for present money due ~~
Q

Just at the verbal level, the semantic level, it

is not true, is it, that the Tucker Act does confine itself to

monetary claims.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM D. RUCKELSHAUS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUCKELSHAUS:

Mr. Ruckelshaus, do you

have something briefly in closing?

j

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I would just point out at the outset that as to the
court8s decision below to dismiss the case originally on the
i

35

1

grounds, that it was a tax refund, while the dismissal order it­

2

self is somewhat ambiguous, Judge Davis' opinion in the record,

3

on page 13, clearly states the reasons for dismissing the claim»

4

He says;

5

"Before bringing this suit, he” — meaning King —- "did

6

noc, however, file a claim with the Commissioner of Internajl

7

Revenue for a refund of the taxes paid on his retirement

8

benefits, and since the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 bars

9

a suit for taxes in the absence of a timely refund claim,

10

we issued an order upholding, in effect, the Government's

11

defense that the petition alleges basically a claim for

12

refund of taxes paid on retirement pay."

So the court, I think, in its decision, did say this
was the reason that it dissmissed the case.
As far as the grant, Mr Justice Fortas, under the
Tucker Act, of waiver of immunity here, I think so traditionally
the term "claim" has meant money claim, and Congress has never
overturned that, that this Court and the court below should not
have overturned this tradition without a clear Congressional
statement on it.
(Whereupon, at 1:28 pan. the argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.)
