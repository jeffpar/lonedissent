ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. MICHAEL CRAMER, ESQ.

Mr. Cramer.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. CRAMER:

Thank you, your Honor.

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
This case was argued to the Court previously on

10
1?

December 12, 1968, on the issue of whether the double jeopardy

12

provision of the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution

13

was applicable to the State of Maryland through the Fourteenth

14

Amendment„
A few days after argument this Court ordered re­

15
18

hearing and rebriefing on another issue that issue being does

1?

the concurrent sentence doctrine enunciated in Hirabayashi

18

versus the United States have continuing validity in light of

19

such other decisions and more recent decisions, the last case

20

being Sibron versus New York.
It is petitioner's contention that the Hirabayashi

21

Doctrine is invalid today.

22

It is petitioner's further conten­

tion that the Court need not reach the Hirabayashi rule in this

23

case since both convictions were,

24

we submit, invalid.

Briefly the facts of the case are as follows:

25

3
>

The State of Maryland with jurisdiction to do so

1

2

indicted the Petitioner in Prince Georges County for burglary,

3

c omnian law house breaking and larceny»

4

5

acquitted the Petitioner of larceny and convicted him of

6

burglary.

7

Common law house
The jury

Petitioner was sentenced to serve a term of ten years

8

in the Maryland Penitentiary.

He appealed his burglary con­

9

viction and the Maryland Court of Appeals remanded the con­

10

viction on the bais ©f its decision in Sibereau versus the

11

State of Maryland in which case essentially held that Maryland's

12

Constitutional provision which excluded jurors unless they

13

expressed a belief in God was violative of the First Amendment.

14

Petitioner chose to take advantage of the remand and

15

on the remand he elected to be retired on the burglary charge.

16

17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Because he chose to take advantage of his First Amendment
rights the petitioner was again indicted for burglary but for
larceny, too, of which offense he was previously acquitted.
Q

That had been an explicit acquittal by the jury

had it in the first trial?
A

Yes, your Honor, it was.

Q

Not just an implicit acquittal by finding of

guilty only of the burglary?
A

That is correct, your Honor, the finding of

not guilty.

Not guilty, yes,

In the second trial the Petitioner was convicted

The question of increased

It was not

raised, your Honor.
Q

Was he given credit for any time served on the

first term?

2

A

3

With the court's indulgence I would like to spend a

I don't believe he was, your Honor.

4

brief moment stating my position as to why I feel that the

5

Court need not reach the Hirabayashi rule in the instant case.
Of course the Hirabayashi rule presumes that one con­

6
7

viction is valid and the other is invalid.

In this case we

a

believe that the invalid larceny conviction infected the burglar y

9

charge and therefore the burglary was invalid also.
In United States versus Trenton Potteries this Court

10

n

held that it would affirm an invalid conviction in which con­

12

current sentences were rendered only if the jury's consideration

!3
14

of the valid count was not prejudiced by their consideration of
:he invalid count.
Presuming that Petitioner’s second prosecution for

15
IS
17
18
19

larceny was constitutionally impermissible the unfairness of
charging and trying him a second time we submit infected the
atire proceeding and invalidated the burglary as well
larceny conviction.
And, therefore, we ultimately ask the Court to reverse

20
21

22
23
24

as the

the larceny conviction and order a new trial in the burglary
case.
Addressing myself now to the question certified by
the Court ■——
Q

I want to be sure I understand this position of

25
6

\

yours.

To reverse the larceny conviction on the double jeopardy

2

ground and to set aside the burglary conviction and order a

3

new trial on what ground that it was infected by the larceny?
A

4

That the institution of the larceny charge in

5

the second case infected and prejudiced the defendant, the

6

petitioner before the Court, Your Honor, in his burglary defense»
Q

7

Why?
*

8

A

I am sorry, your Honor.

B

Q

Why and how did it do

so?

10

A

For several reasons.

One, under the law of the

11

State of Maryland burglary consists of breaking and entering

12

a dwelling house with intent to steal.
0

13
14

Only with intent to steal?

Can't it be with

intent to commit any other felony?
\
/

15

19
20
21

22

24

No, your Honor.

Q

With intent to steal.

0

17

13

A

With intent to steal.

I don't understand this for another reason.

1

thought that this reargument was limited to the Kirabayashi
question and nothing else.

That is the question that is

before the court for purposes of this reargument.

Isn't that

right?
A

That is correct, your Honor.

Therefore, may I — I hope appropriately state that
I have other reasons but if the Court would like other reasons
why the valid charge was infected but -—-

25
7

I

Q

I would ba interested in your theory, because

2

as I understand your point, your preliminary point is that

3

while you have been asked on this reargument only to address

4

yourself to the concurrent sentence question your point is that

5

even if we decide that the concurrent sentence rule has con­

6

tinuing validity you should still win»

That is correct, sir.

prosecution successfully had to prove that Benton -intended to
steal when he entered the premises.
In the first trial it was adjudicated that he did
not intend to steal.

We contend thatthis was race adjudicata

under the Sealfon case that this principle applies in criminal
cases and that, therefore, he was entitled to have excluded
any mention and any evidence of the larceny, thus the State
obtained an advantage that they ordinarily would not have had
in proving intent.
Secondly, your Honor, the necessity of defending two
rather than one charge tactically disadvantaged the Petitioner.
Another reason why we f&el that the burglary charge is invalid
is that the State in this case used the device of cumulating
as many charges as it could so as to promote a compromise
atmosphere in the jury room and cause the jury to convict him
of at least one.

Although, of course, in this case he was

convicted of two.
8

1

We also submit that another reason why he was

2

prejudiced, why the burglary conviction should be reversed

3

is that the jury was permitted to consider prejudicially

4

irrelevant testimony because again Benton had a right to have

5

the jury not consider any evidence of larceny in view of his

6

first acquittal and the doctrine of race adjudicata.
Q

7

Well, burglary in the State of Maryland, consists

8

of whatever it is, breaking and entering a dwelling house in

3

the night time for the intent to steal and if you are right in

10

this submission, how could he even be tried for burglary again

11

if the State isn’t allowed to show that he had an intent co

12

steel on the retrial of the burglary charge?
A

13

Well, I submit, your Honor, that they could

14

endeavor to prove intent to steal by other means, perhaps a

15

conversaion, perhaps burglary tools, none of which were

16

present in this case, but this is one of our points, your

17

Honor.
Q

18
19

a

And what cannot they do in your submission on

retrial of the burglary charge?
A

20

We feel that they could not show that anything

21

was missing from the premises after Benton had left the

22

premises.

23

the larceny case was adjudicated in his favor.

24
25

Because that is the issue in the larceny case.

Q

Well, it is an issue in the burglary case.

tell me — explain the definition of burglary in Maryland,
9

And

1

there has to be an .intent to steal.

2

A

Yes.

3

Q

And that is embraced in the charge of burglary

4

5

as I understand yotir definition of it.
A

The question then, your Honor, comes before the

6

Court of if they did not charge larceny could they have shown

7

that items of personal property were missing from the

8

premises just on the burglary charge alone and we respectfully

S

submit that the answer to that is no whereas they might have

10

been able to, under ordinary circumstances to show that an

11

aspiration had taken place.

12

adjudicated in his favor.

They couldn’t once this matter was

13

We also submit that there are certain cases decided

14

>y this Court that hold that evanthough there is no isolatable

15

prejudice if prejudice does permeate the trial, then the entire

10

proceeding is vitiated and we respectfully submit as our last

17

ground that that is another reason why the burglary conviction

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

should be set aside.
Thank you, your Honor.
And turning now to the issue before the Court it is
Petitioner’s contention if the Court please, that the Hirabayasi
concurrent sentence doctrine no longer has validity in vieti/
of Sibron versus New York which case involved the Petitioner
whose criminal record and background was similar to the
petitioners in the instant case.
10

1

As a result of the Sibron decision it is incumbent

z

upon the Government to show that no possibility of collateral

3

legal consequences will be imposed on the basis of the

4

challenged conviction.

5

I believe that Sibron makes it clear that the fact

6

that a petitioner has a substantial criminal record does not

7

in itself mean that there are no significant collateral legal

0

consequences.

9

It is submitted that the rationale of the Sibron

10

case is equally persuasive in the Petitioner’s case.

11

additional factor) in favor of abolishment of the Hirabayashi

12

rule in the case of concurrent sentences is the consequences

13

that may occur where a valid conviction is set aside at a remote

14

time for such reason as newly discovered evidence.

An

In that case the defendant's evidence may be stale.

15
16

He may be unable to locate and muster his witnesses and thus

17

unable to vindicate himself.

18
19

Therefore, we submit that the

:oncurrent sentence case it is even, the Sibron rule is even
more applicable.
Q

20

Do you happen to know if any of the States that

21

have recidivist statutes would consider these two convictions

22

in this case as separate convictions for the purpose of

23

establishing recidivism?
A

24
25

I do

I am sorry, your Honor, but I do not.

However,

note that the recidivist statutes use the word conviction
11

1

and most of them do not refer to multiple convictions but

2

just leave it at that.

3

Although under the Sibron case it is not incumbent

4

upon the Petitioner to establish the collateral legal conse­

quences if it please the Court I might

Regrettably due to misinformation the Petitioner8s brief states

7

that he has only one felony conviction when actually it appears

8

that he has three felony convictions.

venture to mention one.

However, the Petitioner's background does have some

10

redeeming features.

Petitioner served with distinction in the United States Army.

novel.

In Brady versus Maryland this Court held that the
State of Maryland violated a Petitioner's right to due process
of law under the Fourteenth Amendment when it withheld from
him exculpatory information.
At the same time, however, this Court held that the
use to which this exculpatory information would be put was to
be determined by the law of the State of Maryland rather than
the Federal, law.
The Solicitor General recognizes that the Government
under the Doctrine of Sibron cannot possibly negate the exis­
tence of all collateral consequences and the Solicitor General
meets the problem by stating that the rule in Sibron versus
New York requiring the Government to show that no possible
legal collateral consequences exist should not apply in the
case of concurrent sentences.
However, it is respectfully submitted to the Court
13

1

that the Solicitor General offers no cogent reason for dis­

2

tinguishing the situation where sentences have been served

3

from the situation where the sentences are to be served

4

concurrently as in the instant case»

5

The Maryland Attorney General approaches the problem

6

differently by stating that his brief raises and negates the

7

existence of all possible collateral consequences that might
/

S
9

confront the Petitioner.
Since collateral consequences are often unpredictable

10

we submit that the State lacks such extraordinary perception

II

in this case.

12

Q

Well, sir, as I understand it, the Solicitor

13

General argues that the burden should be on the Petitioner to

14

show that unless his concurrent sentence is reviewed, prejudice

15

will result to him.

16

Is that your understanding?

And if you look at it

17

from the point of view of burden who has the burden or

18

demonstration, however you want to define it more precisely,

m

what do you say about that?

20

A

We submit to Your Honor that it is incumbent

21

upon the State, that the State has the burden of negating the

22

existence of all possible legal consequences.

SO

FOR THE

MR. STRAUSS:

UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
The Government is here at this Court's invitation to

14

present its views whether the concurrent sentence doctrine

13

has continuing validity in light of last term's cases.

16

In those four decisions as the Court knows it re­

17

examined doctrines limiting review of criminal sentences which

13

an accused is either finished serving or has not yet begun

19

to serve and it did so recognizing that in addition to sentence

20

itself criminal convictions usually have legal effects such

21

as loss of liberties which do entitle an accused to review.

22

For example, the Court concluded in the Sibron case

23

that a criminal appeal cannot be found moot simply because the

24

principal sentence has been served.

25

be convinced by the Government that there are no residual legal

discuss is whether the same rule roust not apply in concurrent

sentence cases; that is, cases in which an accused is con­

3

And the notion has been that since the full sentence
must be served in any event on the good counts nothing could

allegations of error would be a waste of their time and energy,.
We agree, of course, that any such assessment must
be a realistic one.

Review must be had as to any count which

in fact does have legal affects upon the convicted person.

Mr. Strauss.

A

Yes.

No, your Honor, you ask whether that ought to
I think I would prefer if I may rephrase your

question to say to put it whether you are asking whether the
-

Government3s view is that it must be ignored and I think we
may claim in our brief that there is no such necessity in our
view.
Q

No, no, when you rephrase the question that way

I don’t understand what the Government’s position is.
A

Well I think the answer is, no, we do not

believe that the doctrine is jurisdictional.

We believe that

if there is any good reason and a plain error may be a good
19

1

reason in a Court8s view, it. may do so in the Courts of Appeals.

z

I should stress that our principal concern is not in this

3

Court, but in the Federal Courts of Appeal„ which have a tre­

4

mendous burden of criminal appeals before them and which they

5

frequently will receive a question as did the Second Circuit

6

in the United States versus Berger, and which we cite in our

7

brief.

a
9

In that case the defendants were convicted on two
counts, one of a substantive offense of theft from Interstate

10

Commerce and the other of a. conspiracy to commit

11

The defendants appealed on two grounds„

n

Interstate Commerce.

13

that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support

14

the conspiracy conviction.

15

that offense.

One that it was not

That was a definite ground.

And second

Now the Court of Appeals characterized that record

16

as being an extremely lengthy one and having found that there

17

was Interstate Commerce they on that ground declined to pass

18

on the conspiracy question.

19

On the other hand one frequently finds Court of

20

Appeal in cases where error is plain o.r clear passing upon it

21

and we say that they have every right to do so.

22

Q

You kind of left me at thepost.

23

A

I am sorry.

24

Q

I want to get you right back to the question.

25

Is there any difference in the Government’s position
20

'i

depending upon whether the question of error on a concurrent

2

sentence is presented by way of direct appeal on the one hand,,

3

and on the other hand by collateral attack, let us say, habeas

4

corpus or 2255?

5

A

That is my precise question to youArid to answer that question I would say that I

0

believe, that in the collateral attack circumstance the Court

7

would be much less justified in reaching error that was

8

shielded,* that is, our argument follows a fortiorari in that

8

circumstance»

10

Q

Mr. Strauss, could in any of the States where

11

they have recidivist laws these two convictions be used to

12

prove recidivism?

13
14

A

We have found no case where they could but if

they could --

15

Q

Well, all right, if they could.

16

A

If they could then we believe the concurrent

17

sentence doctrine could not be applied because we do concede

13

that if there is a substantial reason for review then review

19

must be had, although there could be an alternative in that

20

eircurastance.

21

22
23
24
25

One could also say as we have indicated in a position
which we recently filed in another case before the Court,
Wo. 1022, Croner versus United States, that was a tax case in
which the Petitioner raised certain questions which the Court
of Appeals again determined only pertained to limited numbers
21

1

of counts and specifically determined there was no crossover

2

effect and the Petitioner in that case alleges that there will

3

be a collateral estoppel, there will be in civil actions to

4

collect the taxes which are allegedly due from them that there

5

will be some collateral estoppel by these judgments in the

8

particular counts that he challenged and what we say there is

7

that since there was no review there could be no collateral

8

estoppel,

3
10

I think it would be equally possible in the case you
put, Mr. Chief Justice, to say that since review was declined

11

on the basis of the

12

viction could not be counted toward recidivism so there are

concurrent sentence doctrine that con­

the alternatives in the case that you mentioned,
Q

Let me ask you this:

Suppose this had been a

larceny independent of this particular offense of burglary.
And he was convicted and sentenced as he was here.

Could that

be used as a recidivist offense?
A
it could not.

I think again the answer is that in most States
As we state in our brief in most States

recidivist statutes are designed to vindicate the State's
interest in having prisoners learn from going to jail.
Q

Are you sure that they all do that?

A

I am not sure that they will all do that.

do think that those caseis where they don't do that can be
dealt with separately and certainly in the Federal system,
22

I

1

which is our concern they don't do that.

2

Q

How would a court know 25 years after the

3

fact whether this larceny and this burglary were part of the

4

same transaction,, if they were in a State charging prior

3

convictions.

0

these cases and determine whether they were connected in fact

7

or not?
A

8
9

Would they have to go back, and review all of

Well, I think if one were able to determine that

the concurrent sentence doctrine had been applied applied

10

25 years ago, one would do so through the medium of an

11

appellate court decision and that decision would probably

12

sufficiently indicate the fact to enable the judge to make

13

the determination as readily as he could the determination

14

that the concurrent sentence doctrine had been applied.

j

Q

15
'16

As you know many of these old records are

destroyed and are otherwise lost.
A

17

But then the record of the application of the

13

concurrent sentence doctrine would also have been lost or

19

destroyed.

20

Q

Well, that might be but you would have a

21

conviction of the two offenses and some district attorney in

22

some state would charge as one offense that he had been con­

23

victed of burglary and a second offense that he had been

24
25

convicted of larceny and how would you go about and prove
that they were all part of one offense?
23

1

A

As I say, your Honor, my principal defense is

2

that in all States that we know of I can't say to you that

3

this isn't the case»

4

appears that a conviction was had on the. same date of the

S

same indictment or the same trial, however many counts there

6

though they were entirely separate and distinct crimes, are
you?
A

I believe; that is the case although they were

entirely separate and distinct»
Q

Is there any constitutional reason why the

14

State could not do what I have just suggested, charge them

15

with being recidivist because he was convicted on a number of

16

cases in one particular trial»

17

crimes that continued over a period of a year or two and they

18

tried him for a dosen of them and convicted him of each of them.

19

They are entirely separate»

20

21
22

A

Suppose there was autograph

I think that, would offend

the legislative

policy of the recidivist statutes.
Q

I know, but would it affect the Constitution

23

for them to do that, and if it doesn't then we say that it will

24

not be done to the prejudice of the defendant when this happens.

25

A

Well, I think what we are speaking of the case
24

1

where the opinion through destruction or some other circumstance

2

is destroyed so that it does not reflect whether the concurrent

3

sentence doctrine was applied so that it does not reflect

4

whether they were separate cases so that State court goes

3

against the grain of its recidivist statute and applies it

6

to count more than once in single conviction although on multip1 e

7

counts.

The State would have had to go back 25 years

to establish the other was the situation.
Q

I know but there is a little difference between

19

the power of the State and the power of an individual, par­

20

ticularly an indigent one, to prove such a thing, is there?

21

22
23
24
25

A

If the State were able to come up with one part

of the records it seems to me probably they could have come up
with the remainder of the record.

If there is a record of

the conviction I would think there would also be a record of
the appellate proceedings.

is on the State or on the prisoner to prove such a thing?

other parts of the country they can charge him with recidivism
under the Spencer case and all they have got to do is prove
that he has been convicted twice or so and then he goes to
the penitentiary for his natural life.
A

I think this Court could in this case if it

wished to indicate perfectly plainly that where double con­

victions occur on a single trial occasion, that if review is

Q

Mr. Strauss, do you have any figures that indi­

cate how many criminal appeals are disposed of on concurrent
sentence type?
A

Well, we made a survey as you know in our brief

indicating that in something like 40 percent of the appellate
cases that had come before the Court this term, 45 percent,
concurrent counsel were present.
A sampling of those and we were able to do only a
sample of those indicate that in about 20 percent of those
cases the concurrent sentence doctrine was used.
Now, if 1 may go back to the question Justice
Fortas asked before, 1 think that the doctrine was under-used
27

!

in a sense that there were some eases in which the doctrine

2

wasn't used because the claim of error on the concurrent count

3

was so clear one way or another that it was as efficient or

4

efficient simply to deal with it and that frequently happens„

5

But I think the answer is about 20 percent or in

6

about roughly 10 percent of the appeals that have come. up, 20

7

percent of 45 percent.

8

Q

0
10

11
12

13

Is that an absolute number?

As an absolute

figure, what does that run?
A

Well there were 3851 criminal appeals in 1968

and that would be about 385 f 400,, 350.
Q

3850~odd„

All criminal appeals not just those

involving concurrent cases.

14

A

All criminal appeals.

15

Q

Yes.

16

A

About 10 percent of that.

i7

Q

How many of the total number of criminal appeals

18

About how many?

involved concurrent sentences?

IS

A

Forty-five percent.

20

Q

Forty-five.

21

is that it?

So that gets us down to about 1800

That involved concurrent sentences?

22

A

Yes.

23

Q

About 1800 and of that number some 380-odd

24
25

were disposed of on the concurrent sentence?
A

Yes, as a projection from our figures which are
28

1

subject to error? of course.

2

Q

This is in the Federal system?

3

A

This is in the Federal system. And these are

4

very rarely cases as this Court appreciates, these are very

5

rarely cases on which this Court grants certiorari., the

6

question which concerns us is the problem of the Court that

1

has no discretion to say this question is not important, we

8

won’t hear it.

9

the concurrent sentence doctrine may enable it to identify.
Q

10

Except cis the harmless error doctrine, or

Let us take that sort of a case.

Let us take

11

an appeal from a District Court to the Court of Appeals, a

12

direct appeal, and the defendant has received concurrent

13

sentences.

14

Now is it your position that because there are

15

concurrent sentences a Court of Appeals can decline to consider

16

alleged, error with respect to one of those concurrent sentences.

17

I am. talking now about power.

18

A

19

Right.

It must first determine that some other

count is good.

20

Q

There is no question about the other counts.

21

A

All right.

Q

And the Court is presented with a direct appeal

22
23
24
25

from a concurrent sentence on a count that is supposed to be
i infected by constitutional error and some other kind of error.
A

Our position is that if
29

no crossover prejudice

1

occurs, if no legal incidents are present, this is harmless

2

error like any other kind of harmless error and the Court need

3

not review.
And,, as in harmless error generally, if error which

4
5

is claimed is one which on its face appears to be substantial,

6

appears likely to have infected the whole proceeding, that is

7

sufficient to just to require review.

a

If on the other hand it is not, if the Court can

9

determine that it did not affect the other proceeding that

10

there will be no collateral consequences then it need not

iI

review.

Q

So your theory really is a harmless error theory?

A

I think that is right.

Q

With respect to direct appeal.

Wow with respect

suppose it is 2255 in a Federal case or habeas corpus and
Federal review — no let us simplify it, let us take 2255,
direct appeal in the Federal case, direct appeal to the Court
of Appeals a Federal case from theDistrict Court's denial of
2255, an attack on a concurrent judgment, concurrent count,
for which you receive concurrent sentence, and do you still
rely on the harmless error theory?
A

Well, it is in a fashion.

That is, if the

Petitioner in that circumstance could show as part of his
petition that the other counts under which he is being con­
currently held were infected by that error, then he would be
30

1

entitled to review.

Now there will be the situation on habeas

2

corpus which there is not in direct appeal,, someone may have

3

had two separate trials.

4

doctrine should never foreclose review from separate trials

5

but there would be then no possibility of alleging that trial

6

error at one trial had prejudiced the result at the other,

Of course, the concurrent sentence

7

Q

Q

Mr. Strauss, the problem is that I have difficulty

9
10

ii
12

All right,

in squaring this theory with the Government's argument that
the burden should be on the prisoner.

If you say that this is

harmless error, that your theoretical basis for the Court’s
decline to review judgment in a concurrent sentence situation,

13

is harmless error,

14

on the prisoner to show that it was not harmless error, isn’t

20
21

22
23
24
25

• how can you say that the burden should be

that just the opposite of what usually happens in a harmless
error situation?
A

No, your Honor.

If I may take what one may call

a statutory or nonconstitutional error, before the passage
of the harmless error statute ™- I am not talking about the
constitutional

area for the moment — before the passage of

the constitutional error statute, plainly the situation you
are referring to is in ejxistence equally plainly that that
statute was passed to change that situation.
In the -legislative history we find that without
saying that what is a very short report, one that was adopted
31

1

by this Court in Kodiocos that unless the error appears on its

2

face to be a substantial one which vrauld prejudice substantial

3

rights in which event review7 should be had, but unless that is

4

the case it is the burden of the appellant to show that there

5

was error.

6

Now 1 realise that there is the —

Excuse me.
There is the Chapman case.

But the Court did re­

peatedly stress in that case that it was dealing with consti­
tutional error and as I understand it it really involved
the de termina tioxi that constitutional error would be error
affecting substantial rights.
Q

I see.

So you are making the same argument

with respect to const!tutional error?
A

In respect of constitutional error, what one

has to remember is that here unlike Chapman, the constitutional
error by hypothesis does not go to the whole conviction.

It

goes to only one of several counts and while Chapman provides
authority for the -- Q

How can you say that that is not a whole

conviction if it is a conviction, a judgment, a sentence on

I want to

You raake no distinction between direct appeal

In any of those situations the Government's position

is that where the appeal is sought from judgment imposing

concurrent sentence, the burden should be on the appellant

or the petitioner, to establish that there are practical

adverse consequences that flow from the concurrent sentence

Mr. Strauss.

Yes.

Yes.

I think we are arguing principally on the ground

require appellate courts which are very hard pressed -- I am

talking about the Courts of Appeals

18

19

as to which they can do absolutely nothing of practical benefit

20

to the petitioner involved, the appellant involved, is to

21

enage them in a waste of work.

22

Q

to spend what may

Is this a very efficient procedure that we have

23

in this case where they took advantage of this multiple

24

sentence and not only went through all of the Maryland courts

25

but it has been to this court and then had it reargued and
36

so forth.

2

which would not hurt the defendant and would not help them­

3

selves wouldn't we be relieved of all of these things, and

4

why is it necessary for the State to keep a man under a

5

conviction of two offenses where there is no difference in his

6

sentence as you say, and what benefit could there be to the

7

State to keep him under the cloud of those two convictions when

8

one would do just as well from the standpoint of the State of

8

rehabilitating him and if you

If the State only took advantage of those thing

choose, punishing him or what­

10

ever theory' you have of sentencing defendants, why do you want

11

to fight as you do for all of these things when there is no

good to anybody and some harm possibly to others?

13

A

Well, your Honor., I think 1 agree with you to

14

this extent that the same end could be served from the State’s

15

interest by imposing a single general sentence and

'16

will recall this is the situation in which the question is

17

most frequently arisen in this case, in this court.

which it arose most early.

as you

At least

But the concurrent sentence serves one function.

It

enables the trial judge to give a review in court some indi­

21

cation how he views each of the crimes charged on the indictment.

22

Now this might very well have been an appeal with a 15-year

23

burglary sentencewas under appeal and the five year larceny

24

count was not and if there were a general sentence in those

25

circumstances, assuming 15 years is possible under the Maryland
37

1

larceny statuta I don’t know, and the Court found that the

2

burglary count was bad under a general sentence of 15 years

3

and said well, since the larceny count supports it anyway we

4

won’t do anything.

5

Quite likely there would have been substantial

6

prejudice to the accused so I think the concurrent sentence

7

does serve v&lue of the purpose in that respect.

8

Q

Let me ask you just one other questioni

9

Suppose a man in the position of this petitioner

10

should take the stand as a witness either in his own behalf or

15

in behalf of someone else in another jurisdiction, and he was

12

asked the question, "Have you ever been convicted of a felony?"

13

And he says, "Yes."

14

"You were convicted of burglary, weren’t you?"

15

‘'Yes."

16

"You were also convicted of larceny, weren’t you?"

17

"Yes."

18

Do you not think that would be worse than to have a
man merely admit that he was convicted of burglary?

19

A

20

Well, again, it seems

from what I know of

21

criminal practice the more general practice is to ask are you

22

the man who was convicted on such and such a date of breaking

23

and entering into somebody’s home, and not to specify each of

24

the independent counts,

25

If you have a 35-count mail fraud --

2

Ask them have you ever been convicted of a felony?

3

"Yes."

4

"Were you convicted of burglary in such and such a
court?”

S
0

"Yes, I was."

7

"Were you ever convicted of larceny in that same
court?51

8

"Yes, 1 was."

9

Do you mean to tell me that that wouldn't have some

10

effect on a jury on the credibility of this man?

11

A

112

It could certainly, the jury could certainly be

told about that that was the same offense.

13
14
15

Q

Well, now who is going to tell them?

A

Counsel for the defendant, or the defendant

Can they go in and try those things on such a

16
17

collateral matter?

18

A

13

Can they say that it was the same count, that

it was the same offense?

20

I should certainly think if the

State were entitled to try and get the jury to believe that

21

they were separate matters that the defendant would be entitled

22

to show that they were one and the same and that the State

23

was out trying to squeeze more juice from the orange than it

24

had in it.

All they have to prove is the commitment, and

they have the commitment.

on such issues as that collateral matter as far as 1 know.

4

A

They can’t go behind that and try

I should think they would be able to to that

5

extent,

6

in our Croner brief that it would be competent to rule that

7

where there were: such incidental possibilities as that simply

8

that they, that it could not be given collateral effect of

9

that source,

1 should also think that as we, again, as we make out

10

That if review was declined for reasons of the

11

concurrent sentence doctrine on a particular count, that

12

should a prosecutor be so minded as to do what you have

13

suggested in the future he simply could not do so and his doing

14

so would be error and that to us at least be considerably the

15

more efficient means of dealing with the situation.
Rather than as in this Berger case forcing the Court

16

17

of Appeals to read a four or five volume record to determine

18

a question which couldn't really affect the practical outcome

19

of the case before it and which would delay and quite possibly

20

prejudice the decision of appeals in other pending cases.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS B. BURCH, ESQ.

24

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. BURCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

1

2

If I may I would like to address myself to some
of the opening remarks made by Mr. Cramer.

3

I think he probably unintentionally overlooked

4

pointing out to the Court that with respect to the increased

S

penalty on the second trial for burglary, 10 years to 15 years,

6

this is a matter of a separate proceeding before the United

7

States District Court in Maryland.

8

decided.

reduced to 10 years.

The matter has been

Court be apprised of the fact

17

Q

Did the Court write an opinion in that case?

18

A

I don't, know whether there was an opinion —

19

20

has it gone down to the Fourth Circuit?
VOICE;

Your Honor, the District Court did write an

21

opinion in that case,

22

A

Yes.

Q

May I ask what the reason for the reduction of

23
24
25

the sentence was?
A

Increasing the penalty that it was in the nature
41

1

of double jeopardy„ and, therefore* it should not have been

2

permitted to increase the penalty.

3

It is under the Peyton case,

4

Mr, Cramer has pointed out that it was prejudicial

5

to try the larceny case in the second trial with the burglary

6

case because the larceny case under his interpretation or

7

theory of the case was in fact double jeopardy proceeding,
I might point out that this would be true with

0
9

respect to any count thcifc was held to be invalid if there were

1.0

five counts and one was good and four were held to be invalid

11

you could say that trying the one good count with four invalid

12

counts would affect the one good and consequently that the one

13

good count should be thrown out,
I don't believe that any of the cases hold to that

14
15
15
\7

effect,
Q

Mr. Attorney General, he was found not guilty

of larceny in the first case?

18

A

In the first case,

19

Q

And am I correc that there is no way under the

20

sun you could have

retried him on that count if he hadn't

2!

used his right to gat a new trial?

22

A

I am not sure I understood your question.

23

Q

The original acquittal you could never have

24
25

retried him after he was acquitted of larceny?
A

That is correct.

42

!

Q

2

A

Except if a new trial is granted?
That is correcte

But in this particular case

3

because of the Sibereau case and his having in the Sibereau

4

case the Court of Appeals held that all indictments by Grand

5

Juries who were required to profess their belief in God were

6

invalids

7

Q

Is that for the benefit of the defendants?

8

A

He was given the opportunity.

9

Q

And the opportunity was given, was to get five

10

more years.

11

A

12

Q

To get five more years.

13

A

— the advice of counsel to decide whether he

The opportunity was given him —

14

wanted the first indictment to stand and to pursue his appeal

15

that was then pending in the Court of Appeals in Maryland,

18

or whether he wanted to stand under a new indictment which

17

would have included the same counsel as the original one,

18

Q

So he really had a temporary acquittal?

19

A

He had an acquittal --

20

Q

A conditional acquittal.

21

A

But the court held that he had waived — and I

22

know that this was all eirgued at the previous hearing — that

23

he had waived any of the rights he had under the first series

24

of indictments in the counsel because that was stricken out the

25

first indictment everything fell and therefore he was to stand
43

1

trial as though this were a new trial to begin with in the

2

first instance.

Q

That is your position here.

You say that is

a sound position for us to take.

We take the position that under the waiver

the second indictment when he was apprised with counsel present

9

as to exactly wfc&t the situation was as to the fact that he

10

might receive an increased sentence

11

Q

Where can we find that in the record?

12

A

Well the issue xvas never raised up until the

13

point was reached here at the time of argument and we, therefore,

14

do not have it in the record because it was never raised by

Mr. Chief Justice, in Sibron, I believe that you
made the observation th<it you thought that the pollard had in
effect created a presumption of collateral consequence and that

48

1

the burden was therefore on the State to prove that there was

2

no collateral consequence and I have read the pollard and quite

3

frankly I see nothing in the opinion itself which directs itself

4

to the question of presumptions on the one hand or burden on

B

the other.
There is just a very short paragraph in there in

6
7

which the Court says that there appears to be substantial

8

likelihood of collateral consequences insofar as the defendant

9

in that case was concerned and it may well be that the record

10

of the case would disclose that in fact there were some sig~

11

nificant collateral consequences on the face that the defendant

12

himselfmight have suffered if the conviction were allowed to

13
14
15
16
17

18

stand unreviewed and I merely suggest that because I am not
ready to accept that Sibron itself or that the decisions of
this court have clearly enunciated the rule that in the moot­
ness cases the presumption exists that there is collateral
consequence on the one hand and that the burden is on the State
on the other.
But I do share the view of the Solicitor General

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

that even though that may be the rule with respect to the
mootness doctrine it should not be and is not we beliex^e the
rule with respect to concurrent sentencing and the Hirabayashi
rule.
We believe that if you go to Sibron itself one thing
is very clear as it is in pollard and that is that in both
49

1

instances the Court has pointed out that it is not just simply

2

a case of a possibility, it is not just simply a case of the

3

parade of marbles being dragged along and saying that anything

4

can happen because anybody who has imagination can create a

s

possibility simply because they have an imagination,,

<5

But what the Court, you said, Mr» Chief Justice, in

7

the Sibron case was that — if I have the right quotation —•

8

the conclusion you said St» Pierre versus United States must

9

be read in light of later cases to mean that a criminal case

10

is moot only if it is shown that there is no possibility that

11

any collateral legal consequences will be imposed upon the

12

basis of the challenged convictione

13

That certainly is not the case here.

admitted that there would be collateral consequences insofar

out that in the Sibron case the State acknowledged and

defendant was concerned.

So I do not argue with Sibron, I do not argue with

20

the doctrine that where there are substantial collateral

21

consequences the right of review should in fact exist.

22

The same thing is true in Pollard.

If we go to the

23

language of the Court in Pollard, the Court said, the possi­

24

bility of consequences collateral to the imposition of the

25

sentence is sufficiently substantial to justify our dealing
50

with the merits.

I believe that that showing should be the burden,, the burden

to say categorically they do not because I could be wrong but

I do not believe that they do.

Yes.

The Meade

doctrine„

So you say that the suggestion you had from your

opposition that Maryland does not apply the rule at all is
wrong?
A

I don't know that we said that the rule is not

applied at all.
Q

The other side.

The other side said that.

A

The other side, they cited in their reply brief

and Mr. Cramer, they cited the case of Brady versus Maryland.
Well actually what Brady versus Maryland did if 1 may, the
concluding paragraph of the Court in Brady versus Maryland was
although the judgment under the first count and indictment
No. 4073 was null and void we see no reason to remand for a
new trial since the lower court sentenced the appellant to
52

1

ten years in No. 4074 to run concurrently with No. 4073 and the

2

same under the same facts and circumstances.

3

And what the Court did it reviewed 4073 which ended

4

up by being the bad count but the reason they reviewed it was

S

because it was the first count and they found that invalid.

6

It reversed on that.

7

It did what the Solicitor General has said, Mr. Straus s

a

has said, and that is sometimes they will review but where it

9

serves no good purpose they don't review because of the effi~

10

it

ciency of the judicial system in the appellate system.
In this case the first count was found to be bad.

12

They reversed as to that count but they did not remand because

13

they employed the language of the concurrent sentence doctrine

14

which said in effect it would be harmless in any event and in

15

the case of Meade versus State this was where there was con­

16

current, a sentence on a number of counts on general sentencing

17

on a number of counts and the Court in effect applies the basic

18

philosophy of the concurrent sentence doctrine in Meade

19

20
21

And would not review all of the other counts once it
found one of the counts valid.
Q

These are all convictions as I understand it

22

I would like to be clear about this — under your practice

23

this happens only in the case of convictions by the same jury

24

of a number of counts at a single trial?

25

A

This is my understanding but I wouldn't want to
53

?

make a representation to the Court because I am not 100 percent

2

sure but I believe I am right.
Mr. Borgodene, do you have any knowledge to the

3
4
S

contrary?
If they have rive cases arising out of different

S

sets of circumstances that may be tried the same day, I can

7

see where-- -

a

Q

I am not talking about that.

9

A

I understand that.

10

Q

11
12

I am talking about separate trials and separate

juries but concurrent sentences.
A

That sort of thing happens.

I don't know of instances where this has

13

happened, your Honor, but if it did, if there v/as a trial today

14

and next week another trial, two different crimes, two different

15

sets of circumstances, two different indictments and there

16

17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

were two convictions then I think the concurrent sentence
doctrine would not apply.
I think this would be the type of instance where the
right of review should exist before anything.
Q

Why?

■

A

Because then you have two separate convictions

by different courts, different juries removed each from the
other in time and facts and circumstances are different.
Q

What difference does that make?

A

And then it could have the possibility of
54

•1

collateral consequence.

2

Q

3

A

Why?
Because then it is possible that there may be

4

the number of convictions under different sets of facts and

5

circumstances that a subsequent Court imposing a sentence might

8

take into consideration.

7

a
9

Q

It might have some effect on ---

You mean for purposes of a recidivist statute

there clearly had to be two convictions?
A

Well, I am not so sure because there is a

10

Florida Law Review article — I am sorry, I don’t have the

n

article here -— but the case comments discusses this question

12

of recidivism and the penalty says many states have statutes

16
17
18

19
20
21

j

similar in purpose to the one in Florida.

These statutes

generally are of two classes.
Those which specifically state the rule that the
commission of each offense must be subsequent in time to con­
viction for the last previous offense and those that are less
specific merely mention previous convictions and subsequent
offenses without reference to the time element.
By a great numerical majority courts of States having
statutes of the second type have construed that provision
as operating in the manner expressly stated in the legislation
of the first type.
Considering the philosophy underlying habitual
criminal statutes in which classification of the act in questior
55

1

falls, such interpretations are not surprising,.

The purpose

2

of most habitual criminal statutes is to protect society

3

from criminals who persist in the commission of felonies.
The statutes contemplate, however, that an opportunity

4
5

for reformation be given after each conviction before con­

6

cluding that the criminal habit is incurable.
And that is why I was going to address myself to the

7

8

point that I think Mr. Chief Justice you raised and that is

9

that the application of the recidivism statutes have generally

10

been and I think all we have is almost uniform throughout the

11

ountry that they look at what has happened after this given

12

point of time to sea whether six months, a year, or two years

13

later there has been a falling back into the old ways and

14

more crime has been committed.

15
16
17
18
19

22

25

A

We have no recidivism statute in Maryland.

So

this particular case is concerned although I am sure the
Court will address itself to the broad question.
One of the things that bothers me about this whole
thing is just what is going to happen if the concurrent
sentencing doctrine is abolished by this court.
I know what problems we had in the State of Maryland

23
24

Do you have a recidivism statute in Maryland?

that it really becomes of no particular consequence as far as

20
21

Q

in dealing in the habeas corpus cases with the Federal Court
level.

We had reached the point that I had to go to the
56

1

Governor of the State of Maryland to get additional phones in

2

order to hire additional assistant attorneys general to be able

3

to keep up with the workload in the Federal Court and this is

4

a very difficult situation and is becoming even worse in the

S

State courts.

6

Now this means that we are having a backlog of cases

7

at the appellate level.

8

the District Court level.

9

that those who are not out on bail by necessity are going to

We are having a backlog of cases at
And the net end result of it is

10

have to spend more time in jail awaiting either the culmination

11

of their cases on appeal or new trials or whatever the case

12

might be.

13

And I would hate to think that unless there is a

14

showing of a collateral consequence in the words of Sibron of

15

a substantial nature or in the words of Pollard in a substantial

16

nature that we would create an even greater backlog that would

17

require those people who are now languishing in jail awaiting

18

the culmination of all of their appeals to require them to stay

19

there even longer.

20
21

22
23
24
25

And I think this is a practical question we must
adjust ourselves to.
Q

Mr. Attorney General? Maryland does have an

appeal as of right from a criminal conviction?
A

That is right.

First to the Court of Appeals

and then certiorari to the Court of Appeals„
57

1

Q

Do you see a distinction of consequence between

2

the consideration of the concurrent sentence doctrine on direct

3

appeal as compared with its application in collateral attack?

4

A

Hr. Justice, yes, I do. I see a distinction

5

in that I think that the concurrent sentencing doctrine should

6

be under all circumstances kept viable on the collateral basis,

7

that is, so that they can't go in under the habeas corpus to

8

the Federal Court after they have had the opportunity to do it

9

on the direct appeal level.

10

I believe that it is a viable doctrine that should

11

be applied on direct appeal as well as at the collateral level

12

but certainly if it should ever come to pass where it is not

13

kept at the direct appeal level it should never be abandoned

14

so far as the collateral level is concerned.

15
'16

Because at least that opportunity has been afforded
through the method of a direct appeal.

17

Q

General, let me ask you this question.

18

Assume that we could start afresh now without any

19

consideration of your backlogs or what backlogs would eventuate

20

in the event of taking into consideration all of the cases

21

that have been handled in this manner, what is the great

22

interest in the State and how would the State be hurt by not

23

tacking on this penalty that you say doesn't injure the

24

defendant in any way and I don't know how it is going to help

25

the State to do it.
58

1

Why should we have all of this difficulty and all

£

this argument about something unless it is a real vital

3

interest of the State involved.

4

years, why shouldn't he do ten years on the case that he is

5

clearly guilty of and not have this underlying current going on

6

all the time?

7

A

If a man is going to do ten

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it simply gets down

S

to the question of the fact that defendants in many instances

9

are tried on multiple counts.

10

Q

Why are. they though?

11

A

In this case a jury trial, multiple counts.

12

You have in this case a jury question.

The District

Attorney or the States Attorney as we call him in Maryland
prepares the indictments the Grand Jury indicts, and they may
feel that the then state of investigation that they may be
able to prove through these series of facts that there was
burglary or they may not be able to prove all of the elements
of burglary but they may be able to prove all of the elements
of larceny.
Or they may not be able to prove the elements of
either one of these and they may be able to prove the elements
of housebreaking which were the three counts in these partic\

ular indictments.

The housebreaking one was by the way

abandoned in both instances before the trial took place.
So now you have the case go to the jury as this did.

they found the second count to be valid and therefore the
imposition of the sentence was upheld so that there could be
a failure on the part of the State to prove this particular
aspect of that particular crime as alleged in the indictment
whereas it may be able to be sustained under a second count
of burglary, and this is the problem they are using the
opportunity to try to on the basis of the facts have a valid
conviction and the court then sentences both»
Q

Is it your submission that the sentencing judge

if he is in doubt as to the legality of the verdict he makes
out a concurrent sentence on one that he knows is good, is
that your submission?
A

I don't really believe, Mr» Justice, that this

is the philosophy of the lower court judges in Maryland»
Q

I thought you were getting very close to that.
60

1

A

I would say that almost invariably the courts ^

2

in Maryland when there are multiple counts and convictions on

3

multiple counts arising out of the same facts and circumstances

4

will impose concurrent sentences»

5

It is a rare thing, a very rare thing to read where

6

the court below has imposed sentences on multiple counts and

7

made them consecutive.

8

Q

9

Does that happen very? often?

to

A

How about just a general sentence?

Well? we had it in the Meade case.

I myself

11

don't have that much contact with the lower courts to be able

12

to evaluate what they do on those.

Q

Mr. Borgerding might be

But in this very case I just wondered, might

there have been just a single sentence of ten years’ period?
A

There could have been.

Q

Yes.

A

But I think like Mr. Strauss, the Solicitor

General, believes, I think that the rights of the defendant
are better protected by the concurrent sentences on the
specific counts than on the general sentence.
Q

Yes „

A

And I would hate to have to go to the general

sentence on multiple counts when I think the rights of the
defendant are better protected on the specific sentence on the
61

1

specific counts.

2

Q

Mr. Attorney General,, can you tell me what the

3

actual practice is in Maryland on appeals in criminal cases?

4

Is it really the practice to refuse to review a concurrent

5

sentence?

6

practice?

7

What does your appellate court do?

What. is the

Is it generally to go ahead and review an appeal

8

from a concurrent sentence or does it generally decline to do

9

it?

10

A

Welly there isn't much legal literature on it.

11

Q

I know that.

12

A

I would say that generally the courts if once

13

they find a good count and the sentence has been imposed is

14

let us say ten years on a particular count and that is the

15

maximum for all counts, that they won't go into the other

16

counts because it is just simply a matter of great inconvenience.

17

The Court would have to write an opinion.

It would

18

have to go down as to each of the counts and it would end up

19

being extremely difficult, burdensome time-consuming function

£0

of the court and again unless there can be shown some collateral

21

consequence to the defendant I believe sincerely that it

22

serves no purpose as far as the Defendant is concerned, it

23

serves no purpose as far as the Courts are concerned and it

24

serves a great disservice as far as the other defendants \*ha

25

may be languishing in jail awaiting the disposition of their
62
I

1
2

cases on appeal or on new trials»
Q

Well, General, do you think the views of the

3

District Attorney as you laid them out should be an important

4

State interest where they say well, maybe we haven't much of

5

a case on housebreaking maybe we haven't a very strong case

0

on burglary, and probably we haven't got much on larceny but

7

if we throw them altogether and put in testimony on all of

8

them, why maybe the sum will be greater than the parts, and,

9

therefore, they will convict him on all three and we will

10
1!

sustain all three convictions.
For any sentence the judge might want to give on all
!i

12

three of them if he can pick out of the whole situation enough

13

to convict on one of the counts?

14

A

Well, Mr., Chief Justice, anything is possible.

15

But let me say this:

16

reviewable on appeal and if all of those four counts are

17

infected with some error because they didn't mount up to the

18

quantum of proof that the law requires then they would all be

19

reversed on appeal.

20

That whatever that conviction is it is

That is the first thing.

The second thing is and Imust defend the right of the

21

District Attorney to have the indictments handed down on the

22

multiple counts because let us face it, we have some very

23

brilliant defense lawyers who are at the bar every day, and

24

if they can use the technicality of the law, 'whether it be

25

because of a defect in the indictment or a defect in the proof
63

1

or one little scintilla of evidence that might be necessary

2

absolutely to prove this particular thing* they are in a

3

position to find every single one of these doors to walk out of.

4

And I think then that the State has the right* in

S

fact it has the duty it seems to me* to have the opportunity

6

to make to have the indictments handed down in such a way that

7

if in fact there has been a crime committed which is punishable

S

by the State

9

on appeal* that society has the right to see that that con­

10

and it can offer the proof which will stand up

viction stands.

11

Q

That is one thing.

12

But does society have the right to say that if there

13

is sufficient evidence in there to convict under one theory*

14

and the jury finds him guilty of both* and that one of them

15

cannot be sustained* that still both of them should be sustained

16

because one of them can be?

17

A

1 agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice* if there

18

are collateral consequences that can be shown to have been

19

imposed upon this defendant because of that state of affairs

20

then there should be the right of review* but I must go with

21

the harmless error theory of my brother, Mr. Strauss.

22
23
24
25

Q

Let me just ask you one question I asked of

Mr. Strauss.
Suppose this man ten years from now in another
jurisdiction wants to teike the stand as a witness either for
64

I
i

!

1

himself or for someone else* and he is asked*"Have you ever

2

been convicted of a felony?

3

"Yes..

4

"Have you ever been convicted of burglary?

5

"I have»

6

"Have you ever been convicted of larceny?"

7

Do you not think that the conviction on both of those

8

would discredit him more than if he only had to say 1 was

3

convicted of one offense?

JO

A.

Mr. Chief Justice* first of all I would say*

11

sir* that there is no question about it* if he asks the

12

question he has the opportunity to explain his answer and if

13

I were the defense lawyer and the prosecuting attorney were to

14

try to pull that kind of a trick before a jury i will tell you

15

I would go before that jury with the greatest argument that

16

any defendant ever had,

17

Q

Maybe you had better make it here,,

18

A

It would be foolishness on the part of the

19

District Attorney to try that type of tactic.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

AFTERNOON SESSION
(The oral argument in the above-entitled matter was
resumed at 12;30 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Attorney General, you

may continue with your argument.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS B. BURCH, ESQ. (continued)

7

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

8
9

MR. BURCH;

Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Justices, during

the course of his argument the attorney for the petitioner

10

raised the question as to whether any evidence of the taking

11

of goods in this particular case should have been admitted

12

into evidence because of his claim that the larceny conviction

13
14
15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

was illegal void because of double jeopardy.
I think it should be noted that under the law of
Maryland the indictment dealing with burglary was the entering
-- the breaking and entering with the intent to steal, and
evidence was introduced to show that goods had in fact been
taken in order to show that the intent to steal was present
on which you would base the conviction for burglary.
As a matter of fact it is very interesting in this
particular case because the place that the defendant entered
was a Wednesday Club.

It actually happened to be the

property of the people whose goods were taken but it was called
the Wednesday Club I believe it was and people came and went
and when he was first accosted in the place he claimed that
66

1

he was there as a guest of the Wednesday Club

2

so that it was important that they prove not only the breaking

3

and

4

in case

5

that is why they had the larceny count to show the taking of

6

the goods =

the entering and the taking of goods or the intent but
they weren’t able to prove the breaking and entering,

Q

7

a

Mr. Attorney General, under Maryland law may

burglary be proved without proving an actual larceny?
A

It may be — intent to steal.

11

Q

That is all you have to prove?

12

A

9
10

13
14

so to speak

That is all

you have.

And in this instance then it was the evidence

of the larceny which bore on the intent to steal, is that it?
Or you might say the taking of the goods, the

15

possession of the goods was the evidence of the intent,

16

because the best evidence of rintent is to tell what you have

17

done and I will tell you what you intended to do.

18

So that it supports it.

It would have had to have

19

come in irrespective of whether it was a larceny count or not

20

it still would have had to come in in order to properly prove

21

the burglary count.

22

Now, let us go to the question of what were the

23

collateral consequences, if any, that would be suffered by this

24

defendant by the concurrent sentencing.

25

The first thing is parole.
67

It makes no difference

1

whether he is in for 10 years or 15 years plus 5 on a con™

2

current basis because his. parole rights are exactly the same.

3

If I may I would like to read as the Solicitor

4

General has pointed out in his brief when the Parole Board

5

makes a determination as to whether parole should be granted,

6

they look to the background and the circumstances of the

7

crimes committed, the conduct and so on and so forth in trying

8

to determine on a current basis whether or not this particular

9

inmate may make a good parolee.
Under the law of Maryland, which is in Article 41,

10
11

Section 111 it says that the — talking about the Board of

12

Parole *— it shall be the duty of the Board in carrying out

13

its powers authorized herein in determining whether a prisoner
/

14

is suitable for release on parole; one, to consider the cir­

15

cumstances surrounding the crime and the

IQ

qualifications of persons who become eligible for parole; two

17

to determine whether there is reasonable probability that the

18

prisoner if released on parole will remain at liberty without

19

violating the laws and whether the release of the prisoner

2.0

on parole is compatible with the welfare of society and that

21

is the test that is to be applied by the Parole Board.
Q

22
23

24
25

physical and mental

Are you saying then that any consideration on

release date by reason of the fact that he was also convicted
of larceny, would be inappropriate and improper under those
standards?
68

?

A

Conviction of larceny would absolutely not

2

come into the picture at all in determining parole because

3

it would go to the facts and the circumstances they would

4

find that the same act was the -subject matter of the con­

5

viction of burglary and the conviction for larceny, so they

6

take the facts and circumstances as directed and required by

7

the statute and they apply that test and then say is this

8

man eligible, is this man a good risk for parole?

9

sole thing that the parole Board would be required to

10

1!
12
!3

This is the

consider»
Q

That would not be true if he

were serving con­

current sentences for two different transactions so to speak?
A

If there were a series of crimes and he was

14

convicted of all say five and he was given concurrent sentences,

15

there is a greater likelihood but I don't believe the Parole

18

Board, in Maryland at least, would consider that other than

17

the fact, yes, they would consider the nature of the person

18

his disposition toward multiple crimes.

19

Q

20

A

Yes o
So then on the series of crimes I think probably

21

but that would be a factor that would be involved but this

22

was not the situation in this particular case.

23

Q

24

A

25

I understand that.
Yes.

Impeaching the petitioner's credibility.
69

Well, as

1

Mr. Cramer pointed out in his argument he was regretful that

2

in his brief he only indicated that there had been one felony

3

conviction of this particular defendant.

4

I refer the Court to our supplementary brief on

5

page 20 where we show not only three felonies but we show

6

several misdemeanors plus contempt and this would certainly

7

indicate that the additional conviction on larceny under the

8

same facts and circumstances of the conviction of burglary

9

would have absolutely no effect whatsoever on the impeachment

10

of the witness and his credibility and I believe I gave your

11

Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, an example that if I were the

12

defendant's lawyer I would love to have the prosecuting attorney

13

get up and try to make two crimes out of this thing attacking

14

the credibility because I think it would come back and hit

15

him right in his face ii: I may use the vernacular.

16

Affecting the sentencing of the Court I think is

17

exactly the same posture.

We are not talking about different

18

crimes.

19

in this particular case and I don't believe that they would

20

have one iota of effect on the Court insofar as the future

21

sentencing is concerned.

Wte are talking about one set of facts and circumstances

t

22

Ineligibility for licenses — here we have a man

23

who has been convicted of three felonies, several misdemeanors

24

and under the law of Maryland you cannot get certain licenses

25

if you are not of good moral character.
70

1

The fact that he has had these other felony con­

2

victions, the fact that he was convicted of burglary and this

3

other concurrent sentencing for larceny arising out of the

4

same types of circumstances wouldn't affect one iota his

5

eligibility for licenses because he wouldn't be eligible

6

because he wouldn't be of good moral character in view of

7

his record„
The right to vote — he has been convicted of three

8

9
10

felonies.

of what happened in this particular case.
The same thi

11

12

13

He wouldn't have the right to vote irrespective

with respect to the right to serve as

a juror.
So when we look at all of the factors in this

14

particular case that go to determine and to give us some

15

indication as to whether there is a reasonable possibility

16

not even a substantial possibility but a reasonable possi­

17

bility that this concurrent conviction, this concurrent

18

sentencing might have an adverse effect on him or collateral

19

consequences as far as he is concerned, the answer has to be

20

a categorical no, it would not have any effect.

21

Q

Mr. Attorney General, I take it then it is

22

implicit in your argument that if the State did at some time

23

attempt to use and successfully use some prior conviction

24
25

which had not been reviewed and affirmed because the concurrent
sentence rule that at that time the defendant should be able
71

1

to object to it.

2
3
4

A

I don’t think there would be any question about

Q

Let us asisume the State did.

it.
Assume the State

5

did, some State, not Maryland, based the recedivism charge on

6

the fact that a defendant had been convicted on the same day

7

of two felonies arising out of the same transaction and

3

counted that as two felonies for purposes of their statute,

9

recidivist statute.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

One of them had never been reviewed and was refused
review because of the concurrent sentence rule.
Would you think the defendant had a constitutional
right at that point to object to the use of that against him?
A

If that in fact were the case, your Honor, yes.

In our position as we have set forth in our brief
and as I say here today -Q

Similarly if somebody attempted to impeach him

with this evidence?
A

He would have the right to put on the record

all of the evidence and what not.
Q

Well, yes, but why couldn't he say you may not

even mention that other conviction because it was never
reviewed and was never affirmed.

X was deprived of my review

of that conviction because of the concurrent sentence rule.
Therefore, if the State wouldn’t review it for its own
72

1

convenience, that is all, wholly convenience, therefore it

2

should never be able to use it.

3

4

If your Honor please, it

may well be that, this

4

Court might feel that constitutional rights have been denied

S

and if so then that would be a proper case, a proper case but

6

we don't kill the patient in order to cure the ill.

7

If a proper case has been shown there has been an

8

abuse then there is a remedy to this Court, the Courts of the

9

States, or even the Federal Courts.

10

11
12

Q

You are saying if that were the rule it ought

to be applied at that time rather than at this stage.
A

That is exactly right, your Honor, and this is

13

the position that we have taken both in our brief and I take

14

here before your Honors today that we recognize that there are

15

certain circumstances where there will be collateral conse­

18

quences if you have a concurrent sentencing doctrine \tfhich is

17

applied without any consideration being given to the particular

18

facts and circumstances, but in this case there isn't one single

19

scintilla of evidence nor is there one single argument that

20

I can conceive of, that I have perceived that

21

there would be any collateral consequences to this Defendant.

22

Q

suggests that

Are you saying with that argument, if I under­

23

stand it, do you mean by that that you are saying this judgment

24

should not be reversed on that account but that if a time

25

should come some court somewhere else or even hare by some
73

1

adverse disadvantages were to he imposed on him on account of

2

both convictions he should be allowed to show it then?

3

Is that your argument?

4

A

5

I have said we were here today to review the viability

Yes, your Honor.

6

of the concurrent sentencing doctrine.

We take the position

7

that it is viable, it is still viable, it is important insofar

8

as the administration of justice and the expeditious adminis­

9

tration of justice is concerned but there are circumstances

10

such as in Sibron which was not the concurrent sentencing

11

doctrine but the mootness doctrine but there are circumstances

12

where there has been a concession that there will be collateral

13

were in fact collateral consequences, then in those cases

there should be a remedy.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. MICHAEL CRAMER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. CRAMER;

21

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.

22

25

Thank you, your Honor.

Just a few matters, please, for rebuttal.
Both the Solicitor General of the United States
and Maryland's Attorney General have argued that if the
abandonment of the concurrent sentence doctrine would
74

'3

unnecessarily burden the administration of justice»
However, it is interesting to note that the experience

2
3

of the Maryland Court of Appeal which often review all con-

4

victions whether sentences were concurrently served or not,

5

does not indicate that the Court's workload has become unbear­

6

able because of its review of invalid as well as valid

7

convictions.
There is no doubt, your Honors, that the Maryland

8
9

High Courts of Appeals and highest courts review convictions

10

in which the terms are ordered to be served concurrently»

11

have the volume here»

12

cases.

I can quote from them and cite the

Many of them, all of the ones that 1 have reviewed
in fact deal with situations where two sentences were imposed
as a result of one criminal transaction.
In other words, situations eminently analogous to
the situation which petitioner is presently in.
Q

Suppose the Court did not agree with you on

this point and should hold that the conviction so far as it
is cncerned and the sentence is valid.

Would that, would you

still have pending before us your double jeopardy argument?
A

I believe the double jeopardy argument would

still be before the Court, your Honor.
Q

There would be no difference.

to be disposed of.

That would have

Q

6

Well, it would have to be disposed of whatever
If we took on this one why at least if we held

Suppose we held it invalid but not invalid as to this

7

case as a valid sentence.

3

argument have to be reached?
A

Then would your former jeopardy

If the Court, your Honor, held that the larceny

10

conviction was invalid we respectfully submit that they can

11

reach it regardless of the fact that it was a concurrent

12

sentence because we feel that the doctrine enunciated in the

13

case of Sibron versus New York should be applicable to this

14

case.

15

16
17

Moreover, we contend and respectfully request that
this Court void both convictions because of the prejudice that
was inherent in the trictl.

10

Q

Are you arguing a former jeopardy position?

19

A

Yes, sir,

20

Q

How does a proceeding now pending in the Fourth

21

Circuit cut across the propriety of our considering the former

22

jeopardy point or maybe it doesn't.

23

say about that?

24
25

But what do you have to

A

I believe it has no effect, your Honor.

Q

Why?
76

1

A

Were the Court to reject the petitioner’s

2

appeal in this case according to the order of the United States

3

District Court for the District of Maryland, Benton would serve

4

no more than ten years in prison»

5

Q

Is that because of the former jeopardy point?

6

A

Yes, sir.

It is because of the former jeopardy

7

pdmt that reached the question of whether double jeopardy

8

attached where after in a successive prosecution the defendant

9

received an increased penalty.

10

Q

Now whether that is right or wrong or what its

11

implications are there is a question that is now before the

12

Fourth Circuit* as I understand it.

13

A

14

Q

15
16

21

22
23
24
25

Ihat is correct.
And it is possible 1 suppose anyway, possible

that its necessarily something that is involved in your
submission to this court on the former jeopardy point.
A

We did not raise the point, your Honor.

Q

But that is a different double jeopardy point,

as I understand it.

You tel me if I am wrong.

That point is

on the burglary conviction alone forgetting all about the
larceny conviction.

On the burglary conviction alone he was

given a greater sentence on the

new trial, after a new trial.

He was given ten years on the first trial and 15 years on the
second trial.

That is what is involved in the case now

pending before the Fourth Circuit.
77

And by contrast this

I

1

case involves whether or not he can be tried for & second time

2

at all for larceny having been acquitted the first time.

3

Am 1 mistaken about that?

4

A

Not at all=

5

Q

Well, I understand that that is the case but

That is correct»

6

I haven't seen the District Court opinion»

I didn't know

7

until this morning that the District Court hadn’t filed an

8

opinion.

3

sentencing was here or sentence should be reduced was in

response to a full-fledged former jeopardy argument, wasn’t it?

!
But that was what the District Court’s reduction of

A

No, your Honor.

12

Q

No, it was not.

13

A

The limited double jeopardy argument increased

4
5
16
17

penalty on a second trial.
Q

Is that the only argument that was made to

the District Court?
A

Yes, sir, and that was based on the case of

8

Patton versus North Carolina, the Fourth Circuit case which

9

held that that was another form of double jeopardy.

20
21

22

23
24
25

Q

I see.

So the argument that has been presented

to us namely the conviction after the dismissal of the larceny
count I guess it was, was not presented at the District Court?
Is that what you are telling us?
A

That is correct, your Honor,

The District

Court was apprised of the fact that I had this case pending
78

1

2

before this Court»
Mr. Burch, speaking for the State of Maryland, states

3

that in the Sibron case the Attorney General of the State of

4

Mew York stated to this court at least in his brief stated to

5

the court that collateral consequences did in fact exist in

Q

Mr. Sibron's case.

7

I have before me, your Honor, Volume 25 of the

8

transcript of records and trial copies of briefs on file in

9

this court and I note that fronv the State of New York's

'JQ

supplementary, respondent's supplemental brief, the Attorney

?!

General attempts to negate probable collateral legal conse­

12

quences rather than admit that they exist.

13
14
15
16
V7
13

And, of course, this court did not accept the New Yor?<
Attorney General's argument in the Sibron case.
Q

Does the State of Maryland have any appeal where

a jury acquits a man of a crime?
A

No, but they do have appeal where the judge

acquits him.

19

Q

20

A

That is correct.

21

Q

And who acquitted this man?

22
2.3
24
25

A

But they do not where the jury acquits?

The jury, your Honor.

I would like to respectfully point out to the Court
the petitioner's criminal record is substantially similar to
the criminal record which Mr. Nelson Sibron had in the case
79

1

of Sibron versus New York, and that there are no cogent

2

reasons for distinguishing this petitioner's situation from

3

the situation that Sibron was in.

.

On behalf of the petitioner, £ respectfully thank

4

S

the Court for the great consideration they have given to this

6

ease „

7

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Attorney General, would you mind sending us

That is all we

We don't need any further argument on it.

MR. BURCH:

Just send us

Could I refer the Court to our original

brief that says all six questions were considered by the
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

I know, but we would like

to see the opinion.
VOICE:

Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice, but may I

address the Court for one more moment?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
VOICE;

Yes, you may.

I thank you very much.

I would like to make clear your Honors the question
of what happened on the remand.
On page 2 and 3 of the appendix filed with this Court
the third paragraph shows that on June 30, 1966, the Defendant
challenged the array of the grand jurors.
In other words, the exercised his right to have his
80

1

burglary conviction sat aside.

2

later as revealed on page 3 of the appendix that he was

3

indicted on the larceny as well as the burglary convictions.

4

So it cannot be said on the basis of this record that at the

3

time he made his election which was June 30, 1966, that he

6

knew of the dire consequences that would face him if he took

1

advantage of the First.Amendment rights.
Therefore, your Honor, the second trial for the

3

9
10
11

12
13
14

It was not until two months

larceny as well as the burglary was unfair from the very
beginning.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Very well.

(Whereupon, at 12:55 p.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
