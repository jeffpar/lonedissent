ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

Q

MR. GRISWOLD:

9
10

No. 2, Red Lion Broad­

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the court.
Before resuming my argument, I would like to make a

11

reference to one matter to which I referred yesterday afternoon.
12

-

I raised question as to whether there was something in

13

this exchange of letters between the Commission and the Red Lion
14

Broadcasting which constituted an order, which was properly
'is

subject for judicial review.
16

I should point out that the question whether there was
17

something reviewable there was presented by petition for
18

rehearing en banc by the Government, which was joined in by the
19

other side, and my reference there should simply my own personal
20

puzzlement as to what in these days constitutes a proper subject
21

of judicial review.
22
At the conclusion of the argument yesterday afternoon,
23

I was referring to the suggestion that the personal attack
24

regulations would inhibit actions by broadcasters.
23

32

The

1

inhibition 1 have suggested lies, the suggestion of inhibition

2

1 contended lies in a misapprehension of ,the status of the

3

broadcaster»

4

of the time available to a broadcast licensee is his to use for

5

his own personal financial profit»

It is based on the assumption that every minute

And I was arguing that his license allows him to use

6

7

a public facility, it provides that it must be used for the

8

public convenience and interest, if he doesn't meet the standard

9

of the public interest, the Commission may fail to renew his

10

license, it can even cancel it, and certainly the personal

11

attack doctrine as an aspect of the fairness doctrine does no

12

more than to say that he must use his privilege in this

13

particular circumstance in the public interest»
His license comes to him burdened with a public obli­

14
15

gation and he is in no position to claim that he is inhibited

16

if he is required to make a modest performance on the obli­

17

IS
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

gation.
Experience shows that there is little trouble under
the fairness and personal attack doctrines with the great
networks cmd the stations which they control.

The problem

arises mostly with the small independent stations as in the p
present case.
As I have already indicated, there is no evidence
here, no showing of any hardship or even of loss of revenue by
this station.

Mr, Robb in his argument yesterday admitted
33

1

that there was a personal attack so there is no question here

2

about

3

objection that the station made was to the granting of free

4

time.

suggested vagueness of the regulation -

The only

They made no suggestion as to a problem of scheduling,.

5

Moreover, as has been indicated, they had a format.,

6

They had a free speech hour each week when they could readily

7

have put it in»

8

of music and an appropriate response to a personal attack

3

could have been put on the air in place of a single recording *

Indeed many small stations play a great deal

The Commission does not undertake to tell the station

10
11

just where the response must be put, as long as. the station

12

shows an effort to be fair the placing of the response is up to

13

it.

If it can get a sponsor it is free to do so.

14

Otherwise, it must be on sustaining time.

15

indicated, that is part of the obligation it undertakes when

IQ

it accepts its license.
Q

17

But. as I

Was that all clear back at the time that this

18

Red Lion episode occurred that it was the obligation of Red

IS

Lion to not only to give an opportunity to the person whose

20

character had been attacked, but also do it at no expense to

21

him?

22

A

Let me say in response to that, Mr. Justice,

23

that the fairness primer had been published before this.

The

24

fairness primer is essentially a digest of previous rulings

25

of the Comitiiss.ion.

I think I am right in my recollection that
34

1

at least one e£ those rulings involved the question of free

2

time.

3

letters but I think it is inherent in the fairness doctrine.

It was not as explicit as it was in this exchange of

4

Q

Just glancing through the appendix and I haven1t .

5

read it carefully, there seems to be an indication that many

6

of these broadcasting companies, and there were a great many,,

7

that broadcast this particular speech —

8
9
10

A

I think there were 165 that broadcast this

Q

— many of them seem to take the vie-w that their

program.

11

obligation was met by this simple offer of free time if you

12

wanted to pay for it.

13

A

Simple offer of time.

14

Q

Of time,, excuse me.

Yes, I beg your pardon.

13

If he wanted to pay for it, or a showing that he was a pauper

16

or something like that.

17

A

But let me suggest to you, Mr. Justice, that

18

paying for time on 165 stations is pretty substantial burden

19

to put on the person involved here, particularly when as is

20

our submission, this is really the obligation of the station

21

in meeting the* statutory requirement of operating in the public

22

interest of which over the course of a long evolution has

23

developed into the fairness doctrine and more specifically

24

into the personal attack doctrine.

25

Q

I understand your submission as to the importance
35

1

and necessity of its being free time but 1 — ray question as

2

you understood 1 know was whether or not that was also clear

3

back at the time of the Red Lion Broadcast»

4

A

Not as clear as I would like to have it be.

5

There was no, nothing stated in bold-face type that you must

6

do this on free time if you can't get a sponsor.

7

was understood and I don't think that Red Lion was surprised

8

when the response came from the Commission.

9

a part of the issue here.

I think it

Certainly that is

I should think it would be unfortunate in the long

10
11

run to have it said that well, 3/ou can reply if you can pay

!2

for it.

13

would seem to be a considerable hindrance on a free speech

14

in the development of robust debate which is the underlying

IS

objective of the First Amendment.

16

Or you can reply if you can get a sponsor.

That

It is our position that the objective of the fairness

17

primer of the Commission's action here is to implement the

18

First Amendment and not to subvert it.

19

To induce the licensees to recognise their obligation

20

under the amendment since they are utilizing a portion of a

21

public facility, it has been argued that the First Amendment

22

requires an opportunity for response in a situation like this.

23

That, in effect, the United States would be denying free speech

24

if there were no personal attack doctrine.

25

I don't go that far.

But I do contend that the regulation here involved
36

1

on these facts does implement the First Amendment, does protect

2

the public's right to hear, which is the underlying basis of

3

the First Amendment, and tends towards encouraging robust and

4

spirited debate in accordance with the thrust and objective of

S

the First Amendment.

-

6
7

And for these reasons we would submit that the
decision of the Court of Appeals in this case should be affirmed.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER ROBB, ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR, ROBB;

ii
12

13

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
Referring briefly to the statement by the Solicitor

14

General concerning whether or not this was a final order for

15

which I thank him, I think that perhaps I might flush that out

16

a little bit by reference to the records.

17

As had been indicated when this case was first pre­

18

sented in the Court of Appeals, the jury panel consisting of

19

Circuit Judges Miller, Fahy and Tamm.

20

as to whether or not the order involved was a final order.

21

that time the respondent commission was represented by

22

Mr. Geller, its general counsel and by Mr. Assistant Attorney

23

General Turner of the Department of Justice,

24
25

The question was raised
At

Judge Miller in his opinion said this, which appears
at page 84 of the Joint Appendix;

3?

In considering this matter

1

we are confronted by the threshold question,, whether the

2

Commission's letters of October 6 and December 9 were final

3

orders from which an appeal may be taken.

4

invitation, the parties have submitted memoranda on the ques­

5

tion in which they agree that the Commission's letters con­

6

stitute final appealable orders.

7

Pursuant to our

However, Judge Miller and Judge Tamm held that the

8

orders were not finally appealable.

Judge Fahy dissented in

9

which he said all parties including the one against whom the

SO

ruling was made,, understood the Commission had decided finally

11

that Red Lion was under obligation to comply with the fairness

12

doctrine and had so notified Red Lion.

13

Thereafter, there was a motion for a rehearing en banc

14

in which again the

15

of the Department of Justice, and as Judge Tamm points out in

16

his opinion, final opinion, thereafter the United States and

17

the Federal Communications Commission petitioned for a bank

18

rehearing of the case.

19

respondent was represented by Mr. Turner

In other words, as had been pointed out, all parties

20

joined in that petition,

21

Government filed here, at page 9, appears the statement, Ho. 2

22

hereinafter Red Lion involves a challenge to a 1965 Commission

23
24
25

And I note in the brief for the

order directing Red Lion Broadcasting Company, Inc., licensee
of radio station WGCB in Red Lion to afford time to Fred J.
Cook, so I take it there can be no question as far as the

3S

1

2

Government is concerned this is a final appealable order»
Mr» Griswold has made reference to the distinction

3

which he argues between newspapers and radio in the matter of

4

regulation»

S

some regulation it therefore should be distinguished from the

s

case of newspapers.

And he suggests that since radio is subject to

We suggest that newspapers are also subject to the
Xawj they are subject to the anti-trust laws.

They are subject

to the obscenity laws perhaps to a certain degree.
But that does not mean that the Government may dic­
tate what may be published and what may not be published.

The

newspapers enjoy the privilege of lower postal rates{. as do
periodicals but this Court has held in the Hannegan against
Esquire case,, that the fact that these rates are granted to
publications as a privilege does not authorize the Government
to determine what is in the public interest to be mailed and
what is not.
Now let me very briefly in connection with newspapers
and news stories to the question put to me yesterday by
Mr, Justice White and which perhaps at the time I failed to
understand fullyt or misunderstood»
The question as I recall it was, whether or not this
Hargis broadcast might have been carried as a bona fide news
cast and therefore have avoided the requirement that free time
be given for a reply»

25

39

1

I think in the first place,

if one examines this

2

broadcast, that one must reach the conclusion that under no

3

stretch of the imagination could this be considered a bona fide

4

news broadcast„

S

^

It is a discussion and an attack on Mr. Cook.

How-

6

ever, and this matter is discussed at some length in the brief

7

filed in Ho, 717 by Columbia Broadcasting System

a

the first place under the fairness doctrine aor the personal

9

attack doctrine as it then stood at the time of the broadcast

however, in

10

there was no exemption for a personal attack carried in a

11

news broadcast.

12

Q

This is just under the current rule?

1.3

A

Yes, sir, but even under the current rules, and

14

may it please the court, even under the current rules and the

IS

current rule is published at page 20, printed at page 20 of

IS

the CBS ---

17

Q

It is still subject to the fairness doctrine?

18

A

It is still subject to the fairness doctrine

19

unless the broadcast carries some general answer to the attack

20

in some other way.

21

Q

Even if he isn't subject to the specific and

22

personal attack rule he is still subject;to the generalities

23

the fairness doctrine and in trying to search out the position

24

and present it?

25

A

Yes, sir.

And as the Seventh Circuit held in
40

of

1

the other case our reading of the latest amendment indicates

a

that unless the response of the person attacked is fairly

3

presented by the licensee on the attack issue of the exempt

4

broadcast, the licensee must adhere to the explicit requirement

5

of the rules so that the exemption is really rather

6

insubstantial.
Q

7

8
9

What is your client's basic view of the air or

the atmosphere through which these waves travel?

Is it really

public property or does it belong to the people?

Some people

!

10

have suggested it is like a public street,

11

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

A

I beg your pardon,

Q

Some people suggest it is like a public street

t hat everybody has some right of going into for communication
purposes,
A

Well, even assuming that to be true, may it

please your Honor, this Court has held in many cases that
although public streets and public parks are public property
and held in trust for the public the Government may not under
the guise of regulating the use of the streets or'parks, impinge
upon the right of -Q

That is true.

But if they are — couldn't

they insist, if they are going to give people, certain
selected people, the exclusive right to use the parks that they
let somebody else use them, too, sometimes, under some con­
ditions, use the parks or streets or the air waves?

25

41

?

A

Well, I don't quite follow your Honor’s analogy

2

in that connection»

3

have a license for a radio station because there aren't enough

4

frequencies to go around,

5

Q

It seems to me obviously everybody can't

Well, that is true, and the people they give

6

them to, the Government suggests they ought to be able to

7

require to let somebody else into the facility now and then when

a

there is a good reason to do so,

9

A

Well, that may be taken care of by the general

10

fairness doctrine about which I have no comment except to say

it

that there is a distinction I think and a very sharp distinction

12

between a general requirement during the term of its license a

S3
14
15

18

1©

20
21

22
2,3

radio broadcasting company must observe general fairness and if
it fails to do so at the end of its term it might ssot get its
license back,
I think there is a distinction between that situation
and the situation we have here where the Government tundertakes
to tell a radio broadcaster what it must broadcast and who it
must put on the air,
Q

I am not suggesting that anything specific about

these specific rules, but in principle, do you object to the
notion that the Government may
A
Q

I beg your pardon?
In principle, do you object to the notion that

24
the Government in granting licenses which are available in
25

42

1

limited numbers, that they can suggest to the licensees that

2

under certain conditions they must let some other people

3

besides themselves use the facilities?
A

4

Well, when your Honor says in principle your

5

Honor makes it rather difficult to answer because the principle

6

might be extended to lengths which 1 would not be able to

Q

Well, the fairness doctrine, the general fairness

doctrine still just leaves it in the — as 1 take it — in the
hands of the broadcaster to decide what material would go
over the air waves to create the balance which the fairness
doctrine might require; is that correct?
A

Yes, sir»

Q

And so I ask you again, would you say that the

Government would be disentitled in connection with a license,
to require that the licensee allow certain specific material
to go on the air waves rather than just leaving it up to
A

I would answer that question no»

is what they are doing in this case»
Q

him?

I think that
4

That is right and you say the public has no

right in connection with granting a license to say to the
licensee that here is some material that you must broadcast,
at some point in your operation?

1 donsfc think 1 would phrase it quite that way,

I would say that the Government has no right to dictate

Q

So you say that the Government may not say that

if John Jones, a member of the public, demands from you under
certain conditions that he be allowed to speak on your
facilities that you must do so»

You would say the Government

may not say that?
A

Yes, sir.

I might point out to the Court in

that connection with respect to the general proposition of
fairness that the record shows here that Red Lion did broadcast,
I think half an hour at one time, and 15 minutes at another time
did give to the Democratic National Committee that time to
broadcast a general program on what was called Hate Clubs of
the Air, which included Mr. Hargis who is involved in this
broadcast so the public did have that before it.
Q

Mr, Robb, may I ask you this.

Do you acquiesce

in the reasonableness rule, dom9t you?
A

Oh, yes, sir»

Yes, sir.

Q

What in principle is the difference between the

situation in the case we have here, where they say that the
radio station must have, must give free time to someone to
44

1

answer, on the one hand* and on the other hand,at the con­

2

clusion of the term of the license, the Commission says to

3

them, "Now, here, you haven't been reasonable, you haven't been

4

fair, you have been out of line in what you say is they are

S

using their First Amendment rights and, therefore, we take

6

away your license.”
Now, what is the difference in principle between

7
8
9

those two?
A

Well, 1 notice in the brief of the Government a

10

reference to a decision of the FCC in a case in which it was

11

attempted to cancel the license of a broadcasting station on

12

the ground that the station over a period of years had been

13

broadcasting anti-Semitic programs and the Federal Communication

'14

Commission held that was not a proper ground upon which to

15

revoke the license.

16

So apparently, and obviously I think, the Federal

17

Communications Commission draws a distinction between such a

18

proceeding and such an attack upon a station, and the case which

19

we have before us wherein a particular case with respect to a

20

particular matter, the station is told that it must broadcast

21

particular material through the voice and from the mouth of

22

a particular individual.

23

Irrespective of the fact that the station may have

24

been overall perfectly fair with respect to the issue discussed,

25

this isolates a particular individual and a particular
45

1

1

individual desires from the general question of whether during

2

its term of service the station has been fair* and reasonable,
Q

3
4

Is that a question of principle or is that a

question of degree?
A

I think it is a question of principle,, your

7

Q

What is the principle?

8

A

I think the principle is that the station between

5
6

9
10

11
12

Honor,

dictating a particular program, which I think amounts to
censorship and over a period of years passing judgment on
whether or not the performance of the station over those years
had been fair,
I can see a distinction there,

13

Q

14
15
m
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

In other words, it is a distinction between an

individual program on;the one hand and overall policy on the
other?
A

Yes, I think that is probably what Mr. Chafee

had in mind when he wrote his article on this matter in which
he said that dictating a particular program, contents of one,
is the very essence of censorship,
Q

You mean to require an answer is censorship?

Certainly it doesn’t mean that, does it?
A

I beg your pax'don?

Q

Certainly it doesn't mean to require an answer

is censorship, does he?

Isn’t it something else?

25
46

■

1

A

Yes, sir.

2

Mr. Justice Stewart asked the Solicitor General whether

■

3

or not Red Lion was on notice that it would be required to give I

4

free time.

5

I am advised that there was nothing clearly stated prior to

6

this ruling which put Red Lion on notice that it must give this

7

free time.

While I can't state definitely that it was not,
!}

8

9
10

Ii
12
13
14

15

And obviously many of the radio stations who responded to Mr. Cook felt that their obligation was fully fulfilled when they offered him time on a paid basis.

j

I think unless the Court has some further questions
that is all the time that I want to impose upon the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Very well.
