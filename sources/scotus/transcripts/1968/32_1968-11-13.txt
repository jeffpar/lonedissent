MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Number 32, Gale H. Johnsonj

petitioner, versus John E. Bennett, Warden.
fir. Carlson?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD L. CARLSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CARLSON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

May it please the Courts
Iowa City, Iowa.

I am Ronald Carlson, from

I am here today, Your Honors, representing

Gale Johnson, who is a prisoner in our Iowa State Penitentiary
.in Fort Madison, Iowa.
Mr. Johnson was originally charged in this case with
the crime of murder.

The jury, Your Honors, was presented the

four alternative forms s

Murder in the first degree with death

penalty? murder in the first degree with life imprisonment? mur­
der in the second degree? or not guilty.
The jury rejected the first two alternatives, that
is, the first degree murder alternatives, and found Mr. Johnson
guilty of murder in the second degree.
Q

This was 34 years ago?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

And he was given a life sentence?

A

Yes, sir.

We have a rule there, I believe, Your Honor, that
provides that the life sentence is non-paroleable.

It has to

be commutabis to a terra of years.

At the present time, I be­

lieve, he is being considered for parole,
C€!rtain about if,

but there is nothing!

I believe he would have to undergo

commu­

tation.
Q

What X meant was that life almost means life.

A

That is right.

He claims certain very distinct errors occurred in
this trial, Your Honors»
Q

Has he raised these questions in other proceed­

A

Yes, air.

ings?
He has been denied evidentiary hear­

ings on every occasion.
Q

When was the last time?

A

1949, Your Honor.

That was while the witness

who was suppressed was still alive.

That is very important.

He filed three habeas corpus that year.
Federal habeas corpus in I960,,
alive.

Then he filed a

Again, the witness was still

Ho was still trying.
He took an affidavit from the witness.

He filed for

habeas corpus again in the Iowa Supreme Court as original
petition in 1966,

This was again denied without hearing.

He

then went back to Federal District Court and filed for habeas
corpus.

Mow h© got his evidentiary hearing.

Now he was able

to put on record the significant facts about the suppression
that we are talking about here today.
3
i

Q

Was he an indigent at the time he was convicted,

do you know?
A

Yes, sir? at least, Your Honor, he was an indi­

gent as it pertained to his securing of witnesses.

By reason

of his poverty, he was entitled to use a statute under which
he could subpoena witnesses if he could show the trial court
that the witness was material and necessary to the defense.
He made application and the court granted the subpoena
under the statute.

So apparently that was the case.

The

statute, admittedly, that he subpoenaed his witness under, re­
quired him to make a preliminary showing of the necessity of
this witness.

So he went to the trial court, back in 1934, and

he applied for this witness.
The subpoena was issued.

It was sent from the county

of trial approximately 165 miles away to the county of the resi­
dence of the witness.

The witness' name was Mr. Orsucci.

The sheriff in Polk County, which is Des Moines,
Iowa, received this subpoena, and did not serve it.

In fact,

he made a subpoena return indicating the witness could not be
served, in that the witness, Mr. Orsucci, was confined in a
mental institution.
Your Honors, I am very sorry to say this was not
true.

In fact, this witness, Mr. Orsucci, was, at the very

time of the subpoena return, under lock and key of the very
!

i

; sheriff whose responsibility it was to serve this subpoena.
A

:
?

This fact that I am new stating is beyond dispute in
this proceeding, so we have a purely legal question, I think,
involved„
The records of the Polk County Jail were subpoenaed
into the habeas corpus hearing below, and 1 reflected them
in our appendix here,.

They demonstrate that this witness who

was subpoenaed by the defendant was, in fact, during the course
of the trial, in tsh Polk County Jail at the relevant times.
Q

Is it clear whether this was a deliberate false-

hood or a mistake on the part of the sheriff?
A

Your Honor, the facts, I think, would exclude

the mistake analysis.

If Your Honor's .question goes to whether

wa have direct admissions of the sheriff or a prosecuting offi­
cer that they were locking the man up to keep him away from
the trial, we don't have such admissions.
Q

Then you don't have any findings, do you?

A

We do have the finding of the Court of Appeals

below, for instance, which says the evidence on the point esfcab
lishes a prima facie case that the sheriff made a false return.
That also, Your Honor, is established by our trial court's
finding below.
Q

It was not deliberate, was it?

A

The trial court made an independent investiga­

tion at the mental institution.

He concluded — 1 believe his

order appears on page 34 of our appendix ~~ that the records
i

1

5

there show that this witness was never entered there as a
patient and he eould find no evidence that the transfer of the
witness to the mental institution was contemplated.
Why the sheriff put on tha return “Your witness is in
a mental institution" is virtually unexplainable,
Q

I take it the sheriff is unavailable?

A

Yes»

Q

Did you say this county was 160 miles from the

He is deceased, Your Honor.

trial county?
A

Yes *

G

The prosecutor, I take it, is the official in

the trial county?
A

Yes.

Q

Was there any evidence that the local sheriff in

that county knew anything of this?
A

There is no evidence in the record. Your Honor, *

positive and clearcut, that the prosecutor in our county was
aware of what was going on in Das Moines.
Q

So on the suppression issue, this would indicate

that a new trial would be required, knowing about the suppres­
sion?
A

Yes.

I think the law protects against govern­

mental action, against carving them up into small units.

In

other words, if sheriff officers in another county brutalised

f
j

i:
a confession from a defendant, could it be said that the
6

prosecutor In a different county could take a confession on a
silver platter and use it?
Q

This area of knowing suppression of evidence

ordinarily involves someone, such as a local police officer,
who was responsible.
A

This is correct.,

In connection with the false notes that were intro­
duced into the trial, I will speak just a little bit about the
prosecutor's participation.
Q

Will there be an attempt to re-try him?

A

I don't know.

Q

I suppose many witnesses are not available.

A

Many witnesses are not available.

There might be an attempt to re­

try him.

X think it

would be very difficult, Your Honor.
The suppression point we have mentioned here, Your
Honor- the respondent treats at page 7 of the respondent's
brief, saying “The fact that a requested defense witness was
held in jail during the course of petitioner’s trial is undis­
puted .H
So, as I say, there apparently is no fact issue on
that key question.
The respondent would deny the due process implica­
tions which we allege exist in this particular situation by
saying basically that the case is cin old one.
7

The respondent

asserts that the petitioner in the years ensuing since his
conviction has more or less sat on his hands*
In respondent5s brief resisting certiorari,, the
respondent stated, "The unusual age of this case, combined
with the death of the witness and lack of concern by the peti­
tioner while the witness was alive, served to highlight his
lack of availability

of relief here,"

It is our point that he has sought in every way he
knows how, and in every way a man in the penitentiary can do,
to keep his case alive, to bring it on for hearing.

It seems

to ns it is ©specially unseemly for the State to take this
position when they have resisted his attempts to get this case
into coart, to got this witness9 evidence before the judge of
record, now to say "Well, he safe on his hands."

I think the record bears out that he has filed on®
habeas corpus after another.

In addition to that, he has not

left us completely dry as it pertains to exactly what fchia
witness0 experience was.

He did obtain an affidavit from the

man, which appears at page 33 of our appendix, wherein Mr.
Orsucci said, w0n the relevant date I was confirrad in Polk
County Jail.

I saw in the Des Moines Register a news item

; saying I was being sought for a witness."
He tells us that ha passed a not© to the turnkey,
| wanting to be let out.

He passed a note to the judge.

His .

requests were denied and he was never served with a subpoena.

the case is not much referred to.
would have been used.
in this ’whole thing.

We have our ideas of how he

I think he certainly was a key figure

Clearly, I think, the defense wanted him to point out that the
State's witnesses down there in Burlington, the place of the
trial, had identified him as being one of the men implicated.
He would have very clear!

undercut their credibility had he

been introduced, 1 think,,
Q

Where weis he tried?

A

Burlington, Iowa, Your Honor, is where my

petitioner was tried.
Q

What did Burlington have to do with it?

A

There were two witnesses in Burlington at the

scene who had identified my petitioner, and one of them apparen
ly made an identification of this Mr. Orsucci as well, which
proved to be erroneous.
Q

Do I understand from you that before the judge

issued the subpoena, it was necessary for him to be of the
opinion that this witness wag necessary to the defense?
A

That is precisely right, Your Honor.

That is

exactly what the law provides.
Prosecutorial knowledge plays a great role, or
lack thereof, in connection with a second development in this
ferial.

There was introduced, we contend, false documents,

false notes, against the petitioner
The State Penitentiary at Fort Madison, and I think
this is undisputed, was a great focus for the prosecutor to be

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

We will recess now.

(Whereupon, at 2 s30 pan. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was recessed until 10 a.m. the following
day, Thursday, November 14, 1968.)
