MR. DOWNEY;

Mr. Chief Justice, .may it please the

court:
This is an appeal from the judgment and decree of

12

the United States District Court for the Western District of

13

Missouri which found that the 1967 Missouri Congressional Re™

14

districting Act did not meet the requirements of'Article 1,

15

Section 2 of the Constitution.

Two members of the Court concurred in the majority
opinion; one member of the Court dissented.
The Act in question was drafted and became law by the
Missouri Legislature in 1967 following the invalidation of a
prior Congressional Redistricting Act.
The Missouri Legislature, called the General Assembly,
meets, according to the Missouri Constitution, for a period of
six months every two years.

It convenes in January and its term

expires the last day of June.

'

The Legislature began considering Congressional
3

1

redistricting in 1967 early in the legislative session, and

2

during the six-month period more than 16 different proposed

3

bills were considered by the Legislature, and in the final ’week

4

of the legislative session, the 1967 Act was passed.
It takes a constitutional majority in each House, of

3
6

the Missouri Legislature for any law to be passed.

There are

7

163 members of the Lower House and it takes 82 votes to pass

0

a bill.

9

votes to pass a bill.

There are 34 members in the Senate and it takes 18

10

The political complexion of the General Assembly in

11

1967 was 107 Democrats in the Lower House and 56 Republicans.

12

In the Upper House was 23 Democrats and 11 Republicans.

13

The act which we have under consideration before the

14

Court here today, when it was before the Lower House, received

15

a negative vote of all 56 Republicans.

16

consideration in the Senate received a negative vote of all 11

17

18
19
20
21

25

Republicans.

The Act on original

On final enactment in the Senate, it received the

votes of 10 Republicans, one being a negative vote.
Nov, I point this out to the Court because although
the Republican Party did not consider this Act to be favorable
to the Republican Party as far as a Congressional redistricting
plan was concerned, the leaders of the Republican Party, the
House leader and the Senate leader, both testified before the
lower court that they considered this Act to be a reasonable
legislative compromise, and that had they been in control of

the Legislature, that in all likelihood the political complexion
of the districts would have been different but the numerical
disparities in the districts would probably have been approxi­
mately the same*
That is the only significance in bringing out this
particular factor»
Now, what was the Act that was enacted?

Missouri,

according to the I960 census, has a population, or had a popu­
lation, of approximately 4,320,000 people»
titled to 10 Congressmen»

Missouri was en­

Therefore, each Congressional Dis­

trict, if you had an ideal mathematical district in the State,
would have a population of approximately 431,000 people»
In the Act that was passed, there was a population
disparity between the largest of the 10 Districts

and the

smallest of tbs 10 Districts of slightly in excess of 25,000
population based upon the 1960 census.
Now, what does this mean in terms of relative strength
in population or relative effect on voting rights?
The largest district in percentage terms was approxi­
mately 3 percent larger than what an ideal district should be»
The smelliest district was slightly less than 3 percent below
what an ideal district should be»

*

I

The ratio of the largest district to the smallest dis­
trict was lo06.

Now, that is the factual situation with which

we ar© dealing here this morning.
5

It is appellants' contention that this Congressional
redistricting plan and the population variations reflected by
this Congressional redistrieting plan are pro se constitutional
and meet the requirements of Article I, section 2 that the
House of Representatives shall be chosen by the people.
This Court has recognised —
Q

It is your position that under no circumstances

could this deviation be legal, or is it because of the reasons
that are assigned for it, the manner in which it is done con­
stitute the illegality?
A

It is our contention, Mr. Justice, that this Act

is legal and that the population variations in the Act are so
minor that they are per se constitutional; that the variations
are per ee permissible under Article I, Section 2 of the Con­
stitution and that, the lower courts —
Q

Regardless of the reasons for the deviations?

A

Yes, Your Honor.

If you got into larger devia­

tions, then I think motivation might be a factor.
Q

Where do you stop?

A

And that, of course, is the big question.

Where

is the 'point where this much population variation is okay and
this much is all wrong?
As stated by one court a number of years ago, it is
easy to tall the difference between noon and midnight, but it is
very difficult to tell the difference between dusk and darkness.
S

I I think we have a situation here which, on the face of it, is
in that

realm between dusk and darkness,
Q

What is the largest difference?

A

The largest difference,, Your Honor, is slightly

more than 23,000,
Q

Out of how many people?

A

Out of approximately 4,320,000 population in the

State of Missouri,
Q

X9m not talking about the whole State,

X ata

talking about in the district,
A

And the largest district is 445,000 population,

Q

Is that the one in which there is the 25,000

difference?
A

And that is 25,000 larger than the smallest

district, which is 419,000 population.
Now, there is a factor in that larger district which
1 want to bring to the attention of the Court,
There is transitory, non-residents, non-voting popu­
lation in that larger district.

That larger district contains

a large military reservation, Ft, Leonard Wood, which at the
time of the 1960 census had approximately 35,000 soldiers.

The

district contains the University of Missouri, which at the time
of the 1960 census had about 15,000 students.

It contains other

smaller elements of non-resident, transitory population®
Q

Mr, Downey, X gather the larger of the two is
7

District Ii, is it?

Is that District 8?

A

Yes, Your Honor,

Q

And the smallest is District 4, with 419,000?

A

Yes,Your Honor,

Q

And they

A

They are contiguous districts.

Q

are contiguous districts?

Wall, what explains that difference between con­

tiguous districts?
A

We have several factors®

One is this factor

which I spoke of, of the large number of transitory populations
in that Eighth District®
Q

They are not included in that 419,000, are they?

Or, rather, the 445,000?
A

They are included in the 445,000®

Q

That is, the military population plus the collage

population?
A

The military population and the college populatio:

are included in the census count®
overall figure.
Q

They are included in that

That is the principal factor,
And if they were to be deducted from the 445,000,

what would the figure then be for District 8?
A

If full weight was given to that population, if

they were to be deducted in their entirety, there would be in
excess of 50,000 population taken out of the Eighth District,
Q

That would he assuming that all of those people

8

were non-residents, non-voting.

A

That vrouid be assuming that all ware non-residents

County, which includes Ft. Leonard Wood, with every county
which surrounds Ft. Leonard Wood, and it is dramatically illus­
trated that at no time do you have a ratio higher than 10 per­
cent to total population in the vote of Pulaski County, and in
the surrounding counties it ranges from 40 to 50 pereant»,
So the fact — the fact ~ of this transitory, non­
resident population in Pulaski County is very evident from these
consistent election returns over the years.
Q

i don’t understand, Mr. Attorney General, these

ratio figures, the 10 percent and the 40 and 50 percent.

What

are you talking about?
A

The ratio, Your Honor, is the ratio of the total

number of votes in the county, cast in a particular election,
as related to the 1960 census population for that county.
Q

Would you give us some illustrative figures?

A

In other

words , if the population of the county

and there were 10,000 votes cast in,a particular

election, then 10 percent of the population voted in that elec­
tion .
As I say, in Pulaski County, where Ft. Leonard Wood
is located, in every election there has consistently been below
10 percent of the population voting, and in the surrounding
rural territories the ratio has been between 40 and 50 percent
of the total population of the individual counties.
Q

Those counties all making up one district?

Q

Then may I ask you this questions

Are you arguing

fco us that the differential in the population of these districtsj
is so de minimis that it is of no consequence under any circum­
stances , or are you saying to us that the changes that have been'
rmade are justified because of these things that you are talking j
about now?
A

I am saying, Your Honor, that you have to look

at the entire picture®
Q

Well, I know, but you have to take one or the

other position, unless you want to take both®

I don'l: know®

m would like to know whether your percentages are de minimis to

ence, or are you saying that we justify these differences becausi

J

of these conditions that you have just outlined to us?
A

We think , first of all, Your Honor — we say firs

of all that these are do minimis variations, that they are of no

4

consequence„

Q

Under any circumstances»

A

Under any circumstances»

1

Q

I understand»

8

A

9

Very well»

That a ratio of 1» 06 to 1 is not a significant

debasement of a vote? it is not a significant voter dilution

10

in and of itself; there is no unconstitutional deprivation of a

11

voting right.

12

Q

Even though 25,000 people have their votes

53

lessened and they could have been given an equal vote by having

14

a more contiguous district than you have yourself lined out?

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24

A

We contend, Your Honor, that that 25,000 is

de minimis and that it is not an unconstitutional debasement
of the vote»

As I say, the ratio is 1»'06 to 1 and we reach a

point someplace where, as I say, between dusk and darkness it
is constitutionally permissible.

So we say, first of all, this

is constitutionally permissible»
Q

Well, isn't that, then, the ultimate question

and this other, is it necessary for you to justify it?
A

I recognise, Your Honor, that you may not agree

with that argument»
Q

Yes, that's right»

25

12

j

A

You may come to the conclusion that this is an

unconstitutional debasement of the vote, and in recognition of
that, I say that this 25,000 difference is justified in the con­
text of this particular case.
Q

That's what I wanted to get clear in my mind.

You argue it both ways.

You say that it's de minimis and if we

don't agree with you, then the reason that you have assigned for
the differential between these districts are sufficient to
justify this Act.
A

That is my position, Your Honor.

Q

In what Congressional District is Pulaski County?

A

Pulaski County is in the Eighth District, Your

Honor, the largest district.
Q

But here you have an underage,

don't you, not

an overage?
A

It is the largest district.

The Eighth District

is 25,000~plus more than the smallest district, which is the
Fourth District®

The Eighth District has a population of 445,523,

and the Fourth is the smallest, with 419,721.
Q

May I ask. this

%

Assuming that we do not agree

with you that the differential is de minimis, what justification
is there for having a district of this shape and sise, rather
than to have a contiguous district that would equalise it? x am
looking at that map, now, Number 6, and it looks -to me like
that is a most unusual kind of district and one that would
13

normally be called a gerrymandered districto
A

The Eighth District»

Q

Yes, yes»

A

Well, we have Pulaski County here with this

46,000 population and with actually about 10,000 or 11,000 of
that population being resident, voting population»
Q

Why do you have to go from one border of your

State way over to the middle of the State in that circuitous
way in order to carve out the district»
A

Well, my only reply to that question, Your Honor,

is that this is the Legislature at work, trying to agree upon
districts that will come within reasonable population variations
and districts that will meet fc*he requirements of the Constitu­
tion»
Q

For what reason?

the Legislature»

You say they are dealing with

What reason does the Legislature have for

making that district in that irregular and noncontiguous shape?
A

I think, Your Honor, it is contiguous.

It may

not be as compact as it could be»
Q

I beg your pardon?

Will you talk into the

microphone, please?
A

Yes, Your Honor»

I am sorry»

I believe that the district is contiguous.

It may

But if you will examine the

remaining districts, the remaining districts do have a reasonabl

compactness .
Q

Yes.

why couldn’t this one have?

A

And when you get into this business of drawing

districts, you get into what has been called "redistricting
checkers” and ~
Q

What is that?

Redistricting what?

A

"Redistricting checkers” or “dominoes” as it has

been referred to.
Q

Who refers to it in that sense ? judicially?

A

Yes,, 1 believe the Judge of the Eighth Circuit

who wrote the dissenting opinion referred to it in that fashion,
Q

Not in a favorable way, though.

A

.Not in a favorable way; no, Your Honor.

The

districts other than the Eighth are reasonably compact.
Q
this one?

The question I am trying to get at is why isn’t
They must have had some reason for making this the

shape that it is and having it cover such a great part of your
State.
A

I think the reason, Your Honor, 1 think the

explanation is that this is a district which takes in the cen­
tral part of the State, the other districts do surround it,
there was a territory taken from the district here and put there
and there was a lot of trading went, on with this central dis­
trict.
Q

A lot of what?

Xsn3t that what Reynolds versus Sims

tried to

avoid, the trading of territory in order to bring about an

5

unreasonable distribution of districts?

Well, 1 don’t recall that factor in Reynolds»

7

1 recall that Reynolds does indicate that it may be permissible :

8

to maintain the integrity of the county, but I don't recall that-1

factor in there»

10

Q

Could you have maintained the integrity of the

counties here by a change of this district hare that would have

brought them more into conformity with equality?

Mr. Attorney General, the lower court was dis­

and I confess I am somewhat disturbed — by the

apparent fact that both the Legislative Committee and the Legislature itself proceeded to draft, consider and enact a bill
based upon -- what shall I say — incorrect — I don't want to
use a harsher word — census figures, figures that did not truly
18

1

represent the census figures for various of these districts,

2

and the variations between the actual census figures in 1960

3

and the figures that were used by the committee and represented ;

4

to the Legislature to be the population figures, and those cen- j

S

sus figures, that difference appears to be quite materiale

6

What is the explanation of that, if you can tell us

7

briefly, because offhand it appears that the result, might have

8

been quite different, in theory anyway; the result that the

9

Legislature reached might have been quit® differant if they had j

to

been working on the actual census figures»

Mr. Justice, many years ago Chief Justice Hughes,

you are talking about are soma specific figures gotten from

of a material error with respect to a fact so easily ascertained,
and so objective is really disturbing.
j
A

Well, Your Honor, the error about which we are

speaking is the difference of 25,000 in population between the
smallest and the largest district.

What th® Legislature thought

they had before it was a 17,-000 difference, or a difference of
8,000 population.
19

Q

Well, just take it very simply.

Take the Eighth

Congressional District which we have been talking about, which
includes Pulaski County.
A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

On the basis of the correct figures, the overage

there is what — 3.13 percent overage over the ideal?
A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

And the overage over the smallest district is

in the neighborhood of S percent? is that right?

That is right? slightly lass than 2 percent.

Q

Mow, that is 1.85 over the ideal,, isn8t it?

A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

And the difference between the largest, which is

District 8, and the smallest, would have been what?
A

The smallest district under what the Legislature

■Q

It would have been around 3, say 3-1/2 percent.

A

~ was the -10th District, with an underpercentage

thought —

20

of 1.88 percent

So what you are doing is comparing a 6 percent

approximate — just under 6 percent variation in terms of the
true facts as against something around 3 to 4 percent variation
A

Just under 4 parcent.

Q

Just under 4 parcent variation which is what the

Legislature

thought it was doing.

A

Yes^ Your Honor.

Now, talcing into account thefact,

which

I for

that we should give a greatdeal ofweight to

what

the Legislature does, you have the curiosity here which seemed
to have impressed the Lower Court — and 1 must say bothers ms that the Legislature proceeded on the basis of — what shall I
say again, using a colorless word ~ incorrect figures and those
figures came out only after the court proceedings were underway.
Isn't that right?
A

That, is right, Your Honor.

I can't account for the errors that were mads except
to say that it appears that they came into the legislative
deliberations in the closing days of the session when the final
compromise bill was being hammered out.

There is nothing to

indicate that they were anything other than human errors that
crept in at that time®
The basic sensus data was being utilised and 1 can't
account for the miscalculations.

Now, there is one
21

Q

1
2

Is it a matter of calculation, or don’t you get

from the Census county-by-county figures?

kJ

4

A

Yes* Your Honor, you do.

Q

So it is not a matter of having to make a re­

5

calculation in which errors of allocation or whatnot might

6

occur, because they get the figures from the Census county by

7

county and then it is a matter of putting them together? right?
A

8
9

Well, there is a very glaring error, Your Honor,

right up here in the Sixth District which contains whole coun­

10

ties®

There is an even 3,000 population error and it is very

11

obvious that somebody hit the wrong key on an adding machine

12

while they were doing their calculating®

13

instead of a K5” or a "5“ instead of a "3", because it is just

14

right on the nose? it is 3,000®

Somebody hit a "361

It isn’t 3,001 or anything else,

My only explanation is that this was human error that

15
16

crept into the calculation in the closing days of the Legis­

17

lature o

18

Q

Well, the Lower Court seems to have been so im­

19

pressed by it that what we are really asked to do is to give the

2©

Legislature

21

22
23
24
25

the usual presumption of the correctness of its

result, despite the fact here that the Legislature was proceeding
on obviously, now admittedly, incorrect data®
It is a strange situation»

1 think you would go that

far with me, wouldn't you?
A

Well, I don’t agree that the situation is as
22

serious as the Lower Court has made it out to be,

I think that

the difference between 4 percent and 6 percent is a pretty siighjt
difference when we look at other States where errors have crept
.in, when welook at
Bureauadmits

the census data itself, which theCensus

is an error of 3 percent, so if you have

a 2 per­

cent error in your calculations from data that is admittedly
3 percent in error, I don't think that that is a serious slip»
Q

That makes it 5? 3 and 2 make 5»

A

Yes, Your Honor, I realise that»

Q

Or it might make it I? 3 minus 2 makes it L

A

It could well make it one»

And when we look at

what the Florida court did when they were drawing districts
down there, and the mistakes they made -were far more serious
than this, they thought they had 8,000 population difference
between large and small, but it was 48,000»
Q

Where was this?

A

In the State of Florida, in Gong versus Strikers»

That was brought to the attentiori of this Court and this Court
found nothing wrong with it»

So I think the Lower Court has

dwelt too much on this matter of error in calculations»
Q

Is there any serious argument made here sup-

!

ported by strong evidence on the part of those either who sup­
port or reject the reapportionment that there is really a dif­
ference in order to change the results of a district of having
a Republican Congressman or a Democratic Congressman, or a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID COLLINS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF INTERVENOR-APPELLANTS
MR. COLLINS2

j

May it please the Court, the disparity

of the population of the Eighth Distinct and the ideal is not
25,000? it is 13,542.

So the difference ~ I don't think this

25,000 figure should be misunderstood.

;

The Eighth District

'

is over-populated by only 13,542 people.
As the statistics in the Attorney General's brief
compared the voters in proportion to the population show, the
fact that Ft. Leonard Wood, with approximately 40,000 soldiers,

|

and the University of Missouri, with approximately 17,000 people
at Columbia and about 5,000 at Holla, plus the political workers
at Jefferson City, most of whom vote back home in their own
.

counties, would more than offset this.
So if appropriate adjustments were made for the
transient population in the Eighth District, actually the Eighth
District in terms of. voters is under-populated.
28
i

Now, in the Nebraska case, Eighth Circuit Judge
j

Johnson made a very interesting and, I think, pertinent comment j
about analysing population figures in reapportionment eases
to demonstrate the extent to which votes are diluted, and he
pointed out that if you add up the actual population of the
over-populated districts and compare that with what the popuI iation should be if each of those districts were ideal, you
would gsst the difference between those figures as the number
of people that those five districts have in the aggregate that
they should not have»
In Missouri wa have five over-populated and five
under“populated districts»

If you add up the population of

I the five over-populated districts, you get 2,194,000 some odd
people»

If all five of those districts were perfect, you

would have 2,159,000, so that what you really have is 34,680
too many peoples in the total of five districts»
Then, as Judge

Johnson pointed out, one Congressman

is supposed to represent ideally 431,000 people»

So if one

Congressman equals 431,000 people, the 34,000 excess in the
five districts equals eight percent of on© Congressman»

So

that you have in the aggregate in these five districts all the
people in five districts put together have been cheated out of
eight percent of one Congressman»
It follows, of course, that in any one district,
the people of the district as a whole, their vote has been
29

diluted by one-fifth of eight percent of one Congressman»
Q

But if you carry that kind of an analysis to

the State as a whole, nobody has had hie vote diluted at all»
A

Well,, that would almost be correct»

very minimal»

It would be

But it dees bring into focus, Your Honor, that

when you have the people ©£ half of the districts of the State
that are only over“populated by 34,000 people, and it takes
431,000 to elect on® Congressman, or people to represent one
Congressman, it points out how minimal the deviation really is»
Q

Would you mind pointing out to us the reasons

that you rely on in this case for the Legislature departing
from equality, the legal reasons?
A

All right, I will»

First let me say, Your Honor,

before I answer your question, I agree with what Mr. Downey
has said®

I contend that the deviations are so small that the

reasons make no difference.
Q

Yes, I understand.

A

Right.

legislative function.

Now, the reasons are theses

is a legislative function.

The Legislature can only act by

the passage of bills, and you have to have the bills to pass
the bills.
It takes 82 votes in the Missouri House to pass.
There are 161 people, so you have to have 82 votes to pass.
This bill got 82 votes.

a bill that is any closer than a deviation — or the worst

deviation — where you have over 4,300,000, of 13,000 people.

record, Your Honor, absent compulsion from this Court or some

13

other Federal court.

14

IS
16

Q

That is true.

You mean absent following the rules that have

been laid down by this Court for reapportionment?
A

No, 1 think the rules have been followed.

18

has said they only have to be as close as is practicable.

19

21

Q

This

This Court

But it has said that it could not be Unequal

for certain reasons, hasn’t, it?
A

That is right? and there is absolutely no indi­

22

cation in this record that there has been any reason as to why

23

it was unequal.

24
25

Q

But you are telling us that th© reason that you

can rely on that is because it is a legislative function and
31

1

that is the only bill they could pass; therefore, it is all

2

right.

3

A

1 don■t think any Legislature , whether the map

4

looks like this or whether it looks otherwise, that you can

5

hammer out and get the votes to pass a bill that is closer than

6

3 percent to ideal.

7

can expect in the legislative process.

14

you should look extremely close at the motives.

saying that one of those could not possibly be justified, but

16

I think that is the area, the critical area, because of what

17

Mr. Downey said and Mr. Justice Fortas commented about the

18

Census Bureau acknowledging the possibility of a 3 percent

19

error in their figures.

i

1 think, the cut-off point ought to be in the
I think when you get to 8, 9, or 10 percent, then
I am not

Well, the Eighth District here, if you ignore the

20
21

transient population, the fact is, it is probably dead perfect

22

or very close to it.

23

which 1 think is a legitimate consideration, and which the

24

'

23

But if you ignore the transient population,

undisputed evidence in this case was that they did consider
that, and there was absolutely no evidence to the contrary —
32

but if you ignore that, the 3 percent error could be the other
it could be down to zero.
Now, it is likewise true, as Mr. Justice Portas pointed
out, if could be the wrong way and make it up to 6 percent.

But

I don't see how — you see, when the Census Bureau acknowledges
the possibility of a 3 percent error in their figures, which
they do, then suppose that the figures were accurate and it was
dead perfect.

You still might have a 3 percent errors

Q

But even then it would only be with respect to

A

That is true.

G

And you have enormous changes, I suppose, in

I960»

certain places in Missouri since I960.
A

This is true.

This is true.

Q

1 think Mr. Downey suggested, Mr.

Collins, that

there are in Pour and Eight, both, population changes going on.
Are the increases in both districts — I take it there is an
increase in populationi that8® the trend, is it?
A

In the Fourth that is trua.

that is true in Eight®

I don't know that

I am not aware of any increase in the

Eighth.
Q

What h© was suggesting was that because of

Kansas City in the Fourth, and its environs, there is a trend,
faster in any event, in the way of any increase, than there is
in Eight, if there is any at all?
33

A

1 am sure that is true.

Eight is composed of

strictly rural counties and the only thing that would affect
the Eighth is the military population or the student population
at the University of Missouri, which is located in Columbia.
Q

That was 15,000 to 17,000 in 1960?

A

Well, it was about 15,000 to 17,000 then.

It is

over 20,000 now.at the Columbia campus, and the School of Mines,
as we call it, down at Holla, Missouri, which is also in the
Eighth District, has about 5,000 people — students that is —and then the Lincoln University at Jefferson City

1 don't

know what the enrollment is, but there are about 3,000 people
there.
Then you have the State Capitol at Jefferson City
which has a large number of people holding political jobs down
there who

vote back home.
So when you consider all of those factors taken to-"

gather, as Mr. Justice White suggested earlier, you probably
shouldn’t give 100 percent, which hasn't been done.

If you gave

100 percent, it would make about a 50,000 population difference,
but all you have to do to bring the Eighth down to perfect is
13,542 people and there are undoubtedly that, many, and certainly
it wouldn’t be unreasonable on the part of the Legislature to
so assume.
The testimony was that they did consider this transient
population in the passage of this bill.

Justice, in this record concerning any consideration at all about

out that a lot of bills were introduced.

I simply point

There were a lot of

tries made.

There were reports out of committees.

There were

amendments.

Finally, when they got this bill hammered out, it

passed the House by simply one vote.
Now, in my judgment you get into the proposition of
whether the narrower you make the confines within which the
Legislature cam act, and the more restrictive the rules announce
by the Judiciary become, the less freedom the legislators have,
37

!!

the less significant, it becomes that we are entitled to elect
our legislators on a one man-one vote basis.

In other words,

what difference does it. make that ray vote is equal to Mr.
Achfcenberg's vote in deciding who gets to go down to Jefferson
City if t when ha gets down there, the courts are going to tell
him he can only act within a prescribed area?
Now, I don't suggest that you shouldn't enforce the
constitutional mandates„ of course.

But I do point out that

when you get it down — slice it this thin * so to speak — you
get to the point where it is almost a matter of announcing the
results of a computer, which is what Judge Oliver suggested in
the pre-trial conference where he asked a question of Mr. Downey
in the pre-trial conference, "Why didn't the Legislature consult
the computer complex at the University of Missouri?"

in this case.

In fact; one of the subdivisions of the appellees'1,

deviation is per se bad and they arrive at that conclusion by
stating that it is a fact that this percentage of deviation is
not as near as is practicable»
Thereby^ they assume the very thing that is in issue
and; having assumed that it is not as nearly equal as is prac­
ticable , they point to the language of a couple of opinions and
say that we have the burden of proof®

quently; the burden of proof of demonstrating that it is uncon­
stitutional is where that burden always is and that is on the
people asserting unconstitutionality.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING ACHTENBERG; ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. ACHTENBERG
the Court;

%

Mr. Chief Justice; and may it please

At the outset; the appellees wish to make it clear

i

.

‘

that we-do not agree with the issue as first stated in the
41
I

■i

appellants8 jurisdictional statement that what the Trial Court

2

held was that the Legislature's plan was bad purely and simply

3

because a better plan could have been or was proposed.
We don't think that is the rule»

4

We don’t think the

5

Trial Court held that and we are not asking this Court to so

6

hold.
What we think the Trial Court was very simply and in

7

8

accordance with prior decisions of this Court; that upon the

9

evidence before it, the Legislature had not developed and pre­

'10

sented a plan which approached practicable equality of popula”

11

fcion; and further, that that was demonstrated very simply —

12

although in many other ways — but very simply by the fact that

13

there were i*hole counties which could have been transferred intd
■
the out-of-balance districts and have improved the balance of

14
15

16
17
18

those districts? and that furthermore, the Legislature, in its
proceedings and before the court, did not give constitutionally
justifiable and rational grounds for their exceeding the reason­
able variations.
Q

19
20

is the test for the judge to decide?
A

21

22
23
24
25

What do you say is the test?

What do you argue

The crucial point.

We think the test in each case must he that the

court must examine the evidence before it, determine if there
is a plan which is reasonable, which approximates practicable
equality of

population in view of the facts in that particular

Stata.

42

j

1

■

If it does not do so, then the court must decide if

2

there are justifiable —- constitutionally justifiable

3

for exceeding that boundary.

4

that this Court should not, and we ask it not, to set any per­

5

centage i to accept any doctrine of de minimis, or to say that

6

the situation in one State may be applied on a fair percentage

7

formula to the situation in any other State.

S
9

, 10

Q

reasons

We are saying very specifically

What do you suggest the Legislature could have

done that would have brought about a more near approach to
equality?
A

11

If the Court please, I will refer to the map,

12

which is simply an enlargement of the map appearing on page 15

13

of th© appellees8 brief and which was also before the court.

14

The only difference is that the chief villain in the piece,

15

the Eighth Congressional District, I have outlined in red be­

16

cause

17

it is identical.

18

| 19

it is in the State in the reproduction.

j

[

Other than that,

But I should point out that we do not say that the
only villain is the Eighth District, because five districts are

i

20

over-represented, and five districts are under-represented in

21

substantial degree, and we feel that every district must be con­

22

sidered in evaluating this problem.

23
24
25

Wow, Missouri is peculiarly situated with regard to
the structuring of its sub-governmental units, so that we think
that Missouri could be the shining example of how Congressional
43

!
t

Districts could be drawn with almost mathematical.exactness
and I will give the Court my reason for that,
Missouri, beyond almost every State, has 114 counties.•
The City of St» Louis, which by statute is, in effect, a county in other words, 115 counties to be divided between 10 Congres­
sional Districts.

We have the two masses of population density

on the left of the State in Kansas City, the Fifth District, and
on the east of the State in St. Louis and Sfc. Louis County, the
First, Second, and Third Districts.
Those four districts do not exceed the boundaries of
one county.

In fact, in each case there are portions of the

county left t© go into the rural districts.
W® have remaining six Congressional Districts to be
divided among 115 counties, or mathematically, wa have an average
of 19 county building blocks within which to structure a Congressional District.

Mow, obviously, the more building blocks

j

you have, and the smaller the building blocks, the easier it is,
without crossing county lines, to create Congressional Districts
of great, exactitude.
Now, beyond that in Missouri, the fact is that there
■are 38 counties of the State, or almost exactly one-third, which
}

have less than 10,000 population, which means that there is a
■great flexibility of shifting of whole counties,

-In fact, with

regard to the variances in this case, the variance in the Eighth
District of an excess of over 13 „000 population — that figure
44

1

of 13,000 population is more than the population of half of the

2

counties of Missouri, of each of the 59 counties of Missouri»

O

If you take the total variance of 26,900 — almost

4

26,000 — that variance is more than the population of any of

5

95 of the 115 counties of Missouri»

6

In addition, the map, which also appears in our brief,

7

fortuitously on the Legislature's plan, there are small counties

3

abutting the Eighth District which, simply by shifting of the

'3

abutting counties, very easily the Legislature could have made

m

ii
32

these changes.
Q

Now, I should say that ~
What difference would that have made in the

other district?
-

13

h

This is true of every district.

If we want only

'i 4

to shift population from the Eighth to the Fourth which, of

55

course, is the one which swings the greatest in over-represen­

16

tation, but from the Seventh to the Fourth, from, the Ninth to

17

the Sixth, from the Eighth to the Tenth, from the Seventh to

13

the Tenth, and since in the urban areas the Legislature did not

19

hold to county lines but, in fact, went to township lines, went

20

to ward lines, and even to precinct lines, we could, following

21

the oattern of the Legislature, and the Legislature could have,

22
23

24
25

shifted from District 1 into 9, which would bring it up to
equality while if it shifted 5,000 to 6, which would drop it
down, then —
Q

You mean 5,000 people?

45

I

A

Yes, sir.

Q

Splitting up the counties?

A

You can take Schuyler County from District 9

into District S, which would bring District 6 up 5,000 closer
to equality.

That would short District 9

Would, that split the county?

A

No, sir? that would be shifting —

It would be in the same district.

That would be shifting a full county from Dis-

Mow* that

■■from 3 and give it to 4, which would equalise the two districts.
A

Not to arrive at mathematical perfection, but to

get within 2,000, you could shift either Howard County with

10,359 that abuts Congressional District 4, or you could reach
almost the same result by shifting Morgan County, which com­
pletely abuts the adjoining

county, with a population of 9,476

which would bring your variances in those two cases to a matter
of a thousand or two, rather than the rang® of 26,000„
Q

Is your prime concern only — is there any

practical political compilation or something for your protest
against this result?

What is it?

Are you just concerned to

raise and have decided the abstract question whether excesses
and overages are wrong, or is there something else that your
clients are concerned with?
A
in this

Well, Your Honor, if the Court pleas®, we are

one can never speak for why the individual parties

are there, but we are not attacking any particular line because
it favored Republicans or favored Democrats —
Q

So your clients8 only interest in this is that

it be done as the constitutional decisions require it to be
don®, is that it?
A

I think that statement is correct, and I can

certainly say that their attorneys are only proposing — only
appearing -- and we appear, of course, as appellees„
Q

Well, ordinarily,

you know, in these cases,
48

i

there seem fco be partisan interests served by the different
sides,, but that is not true here, is it?
Ik

To my knowledge, no, sir.

Again, this is my

j statement, confirmed by Mr. Preisler, who is one of the plain-

j

tiffs and is not in the record.
Q

Is the dispute simply over the fact the courts

have said they must be as nearly alike as possible in population
and that abstractly you don’t think they are and that they could'
have made it a little closer?
Ik

I would agree with the Justice’s statement except

that not a little closer? they could have done a lot better and
■

could have done so very easily.
Q

But you have no argument of any kind based on

the fact that somehow the voters are going to be hurt by what
is done?

cussions on motives.

tion that this is not a d@ minimis situation.

A

20
21

Well, we think it is an element of a pragmatic

Well, I would have to be specific.

I certainly \

don’t think that seeking to create a Negro district, or seeking
to exclude Negroes — a racial gerrymander -- would be accept­
able.

We don’t think a political gerrymander would be accept­

able .
I struggle with it simply because to talk of legislative
50

compromise tells me very little.

Basically, my position is that

it is not an acceptable —
Q

But that is a pragmatic fact of life that has to

be considered, isxiet it?
A

I would say no, sir, because this Legislature

met. three times on this problem,,

If the Court wanted to accept

the first act of the Legislature which could have been justified
by the same basis -- in other words, if this was the best that
could get through, and on a political basis -- I suppose you
could say it was, then the Court would have had to accept that
fact.
Q

Now if that is true, unless you can show some­

thing that just shocks you some way, just so outrageous that

nobody can take it, or you can show that it aids the Republican

unless you just

do you know they haven't?
A

The history of reapportionment, as the Justice

well knows, shows that what happened after Congo versus Breen
was that the legislatures of the several States structured

Congressional Districts which ranged as far as 600,000 from one
range to the other,
Q

I know that very well,

1 studied that case and

that's why 1 dissented from what the Court bald.

But that was

a big, understandable, on its face so outrageous and so far fron
what was practical that that rather answered itself„ without
regard to the fact that they are in the legislature and they
are doing the best they can to bring about an equality,
A

I would still not accept the argument made of

legislative practicability because this, in effect, says that
in a State, as in Missouri, where one party has the majority
in both houses, it may politically structure the districts so
as to be favorable to that party.
It seems to me that is wrong9 and it seems to me
that if it exceeds practicable papulation percentages, it is
contrary to the mandate of this Court.
Q

Calling your attention to the table on page 55

of the Appellants' brief on the merits, that purports to be a
list of all the States

,

I gather, in order of deviation in fcheii

Congressional Districts from, the perfect average district, begin­
ning with the smallest deviation and ending up with the largest,
is that what that is?
I appreciate this isn't your table? it is your
opponents9 but I assume you are familiar with it,
A

I believe so? yes, sir.
52

Q

That shows Missouri to be the eleventh best in

the country from the point of view of size of deviation?
A

I just counted»

Yes, sir; that is correct»

Florida is about twentieth.

If I might address myself to —

Q

I was going to ask you, do you quarrel with

the

factual accuracy of this table?
A

!

I don't quarrel with the percentage variations.

I do quarrel with using percentages as a standard for judging
one State as against another State,

I would like to speak to

that point.
Q

Well, I agree with you on that,

I did speak to

that poiiit at some length in dissenting in Lucas against the
Colorado General Assembly,

I don't think our 50 States are

fungible goods, either,
Q

\

May I ask you this question?

You may want to

answer it after lunch, which would be all right with me.
Your argument seems to me in one respect, anyway,
to depend upon burden of proof and your brief argues that the
burden of proof to burden of justifying deviations from the
ideal is on the State.
53

I wonder if it isn't possible that the question of
burden of proof may be a little more complex than that.

The way
f

you have what appears to be a gross and nonpermissible varia­
tion, whatever target figure one may have in mind, five or ten
percent particularly, whatever target figure in particular
circumstances one may have in mind, where there is a mathe­
matically large or gross deviation from the one man-one vote
mathematics, that then the burden is on the State to justify
it, but may it not be that where •— and perhaps this is such a
case — the variation is relatively modest, that the burden may
then be on those attacking the plan?
•v
That is to say, you are trying now to bear that bur­
den in one respect by saying that the State could 'do batter and
could come to a closer approximation of the mathematically
ideal.

Some of my .brethren have asked you whether you have

other complaints about the plan,, such as political gerrymander­
ing or other attempts to keep incumbents in office, or whatever
it may be.
As I understand it, your answer to that has been no.
But what I am saying to you is, isn't it possible that where
the figures are such that the mathematical deviation does not
appear gross, that the burden is then on the other party, name!'
the party attacking the plan?
A

well, Mr. Justice, it seems to me that the

burden does not shift when we get into this matter of the
54

weight of the evidence,

I would say that the burden rests with

the proponents to justify their plan»

Perhaps visually;, or

on examination of simple figures, they might sustain the burden
of going forward and then perhaps we have a burden which we
have assumed in this case —
Q

Yes»

That may be a more accurate way of stating

A

— of showing that they have failed, in that re­

it.

gard and. that they have failed to justify what we consider sub­
stantial variances under the peculiar situation in Missouri.
Q

But if you assume that the State has borne its

burden by showing that these figures are within tolerable range
then the only thing you have been talking about thus far is
that they could have done better,
A

No, sir.

Our position —*

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARRENs

We will recess now.

(Whereupon, at 12 Noon the Court recessed, to recon­
vene at 12230 p.m. the same day.)

55

(The argument in the above-entitled matter was re­
sumed at 12:30 p.ra.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Achtenberg, you may

continue with your argument.
FURTHER ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING ACHTENBERG, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. ACHTENBERG:

Thank you.

To continue with my answer to the Justice's question,
it is our position that the appellant, the attorneys represent­
ing the State did not meet the burden of proof and we think —
well, quite specifically, the Lower Court so held.

In both the

opinion of Judge Oliver and Judge Collinson, they both indi­
cated that the burden of proof had not been met by the pro­
ponents of the plan.
Of course, wa recognise that this Court must examine
that and we will continue to argue that they have not, and I
would like to continue somewhat from the map.
One additional piece of evidence, of the 10 Congres­
sional Districts, one might say that the first three, in St.
Louis and Sfc. Louis County, which are exclusively urban and
suburban, and Five, which is Kansas City, Jackson County but
exclusively Kansas City, three of those four are well overpopulated, which means, of course, that they are wall under­
represented, three out of the four.
Mow, the Eighth District has been characterised in
56

(

the appellants5 brief as in the group of predominantly rural.
The fact isi? of course,,- that it has major cities and it extends
well into the urban area of St. Louis County.

So we may,, in

effect, consider it as a mixture and for the purposes of ray
argument, 1 would ignore it.
This leaves five predominantly rural Congressional
Districts, and four of those five are under-populated and,
therefore, over-represented.
versus Sims situation.

So we have the classic Reynolds

We have rural areas strongly favored,

three out of four over-represented, against the urban areas
under-represented three out of our.
I would like to speak to the question raised both
in the briefs and the arguments as to the percentage compari­
sons with the Florida case, Gong versus Kirk, and the Missis­
sippi case, Connor versus Johnson.
First of all, the Court will recall that this Court
affirmed the Lower Court.

It was not the situation we have

in the instant case where this Court is being asked to review
the weight of the evidence and reverse the Trial Court.
'j

Secondly, although I realize there is dispute between
the appellants and the appellees and between the majority
decision in the court below and the dissenting opinion as to
what the issue was before this Court in Connor versus Johnson,
we still hold to our position that the only issue raised there
was the issue of racial gerrymandering.

57

So this question of "as equal as practical by popu­
lation” really is not presented to the Court and, therefore,
the Court did not fully consider and weigh the question of
percentage variances.
But more than that, I think we must go to the concepts
behind structuring of districts to see why comparisons between
States are of little and perhaps no- value.
There are various factors: the total population of
the State," the population distribution in the State.
dense urban areas?

How many dense urban areas?

in relation to rural areas?

Are there

How are they

The number of counties, large or

small? the siae of the counties.

Are they easily movable?

The

location of the counties, as in the particular plan, are they
so located that they may be shifted from one district to the
other.

In other words, the total geographic relationship of

dense, large counties to the rural and sparsely populated coun­
ties.
Now, in considering these factors, as I illustrated
before, Missouri is in an ideal situation.

We are at the ex-

treme of having our two densely populated areas in two corners
of the State and in the entire mass of the State we have these
115 counties to be divided roughly 20 to a Congressional Dis­
trict.
Now how does this relate, just for illustration —
and I do not cite these examples to argue the comparisons
58

specifically,, but two examples which illustrate why the problem
could well be different in other States.
Let us take first New York.

New York, with 17 millior

population, as opposed to Missouri's 4 million, with 41 Congres­
sional Districts, has only 62 counties.

This means as a matter

of actual fact in the maps before this Court in the case to
follow, that the Congressional Districts in no case have more
than four or five counties to a district, so your building
blocks ware large and the flexibility was very limited.
So you might well argue that the percentage is signi­
ficant in that State but they have no significance when you
discuss the Missouri situation.
The same thing, to a different extent, is true in
Gong vesrsus Kirk in Florida.

Florida had 12 Congressional Dis­

tricts, but instead of Missouri's 115 counties, it has 67 and
the distribution there was such that in six districts only
three counties were involved, one district four counties,

and

in four districts it rose to nine or ten, and in only one dis­
trict did it ri.se to the level of the flexibility of Missouri,
which has — in that case they consolidated 23 counties.
So it seems to me that we coma back to the fact that
percentages simply are not meaningful. The test should be a
good-faith effort to be the best that can be done and we submit
that in Missouri the Legislature failed by a long shot,
Q

Mr. Achtenberg, fully understanding your position
53

r

that percentage comparisons, par se, are not very meaningful,
let me call your attention again to the table on page 55 of
the appellants8 brief on the merits, which indicates, as you
agreed, that Missouri seems to be the eleventh best State in
the Union from the point of view of percentage deviation,
I notice here that in the legend on the bottom, it
indicates that two asterisks means that the data has been
verified by court opinion, and I notice that that is true of
the following States that have larger deviations than Missouri:
Mississippi, Montana, Florida, Alabama, Illinois, Kansas, New
Jersey and New Hampshire; that the data has been verified by
court opinion.
Would it be accurate or inaccurate to infer from that
that those have had court approval?
Well, I certainly can't speak with specific

A

knowledge of each of those cases'.
courts reviewed the question,
before this Court.

I certainly gather that the

in no case were those matters

If I am correct ~~

Q

Well, in the Florida case we agreed.

A

Yes, the Florida case? yes.

Other than that, I

would simply say that the issues are different in each case,
the geographic, the geo-political arrangements of the States
were different.

Perhaps there were factors in some of those

cases where justifiable variations were obtained for reasons
not existing in the Missouri situation.
SO

Q

Yes, but my eKplic.it question was, when it says

here that the data has been verified by court opinion, does that
mean that those plans have been approved by court decision?

Yoi

don't know the answer to that?
A

No, sir i I would assume that that does so indi­

cate»
I would now like to go to the question raised by the
appellants with regard, to what they view as the peculiar nature
of the Eighth Congressional District»
1 would first point out that there was virtually no
evidence before the Court that the Legislature considered the
student population, transient population, or military population»
The only testimony was that of two of the Representatives, who
stated that they saw this as a factor»
The fact is, there are no statistics for this Court,
there were no statistics before the Lower Court, as to what the
situation is in any of the other nine Congressional Districta»
i

I would like to speak to that point»
They speak of the State University in the Eighth, but'
in the Fourth, the adjoining district, at the opposite end of
the scale, there is Central Missouri State College, a State
College, there are the schools in Kansas City, these are, as
throughout the State of Missouri, numerous sectarian colleges»
On the question of the military establishment at Ft,
Leonard Wood in the Fourth District, again at the opposite end

SI

Without a statistical analysis of this, it seems to me
it is completely without meaning to argue that there was some
legitimate consideration given to the Eighth Congressional Dis­

The same argument, it seems to me, applies with regarc

to the question of population trends.

Q

Can you, without too much trouble, indicate

what were the lines of the Eighth District before this redis­
tricting?

Was Jefferson County in the same district?
A

Frankly, I cannot, sir.

I am not sure of that.
62

I think Jefferson was.

The gentleman indicates that is correct, but I don’t
have the line of the district.
Q

There is no map anywhere in these papers, is

there, that shows district lines before the redistricting?
A

I think not.

Does any other counsel know?
In 257 Fed. Supp. I am told that it does appear.
I believe I am correct in this, however: that the
neck or the tail, which extends into St. Louis County, is a new
innovation which picks up substantial urban population to throw
into this central Missouri district.
Q

Are there any improper motives that you ascribe

to the Legislature in making these apportionments.
A

Well, I certainly would have to be bound by the j

record and by the statements of the appellants' counsel.

The

statistics before the Court indicate a favoring of the rural
area versus the city areas.

They are either

talking about personal considerations, keeping a particular
Representative or Congressman within his own district; or the
other alternative is favoring the district from a political,
from a partisan political standpoint.

If the Court please, it seems to the appellees in this

more cases will come before this Court.

We think that the Court would do well to stand on its

I would like to summarize by quoting from Reinhold

Neibuhr, who said "The vision of a just society is an impos­

8

sible one which can be approximated only by those who do not

9

regard it as impossible.

Perhaps mathematical equality may be

10

impossible, but equality of a voter’s rights will only be

11

achieved when those charged with the task seek equality and do

12

not view it as impossible."

Thank you.
