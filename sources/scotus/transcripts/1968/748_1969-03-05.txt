ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY N. HERNDON, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HERNDON:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
This is a murder case in which the defendant’s con­

11
12

viction of first degree murder was reversed by the Delaware

13

Supreme Court for a trial de novo.

14

this Court’s decision in Miranda and convicted of second degree

15

murder.
The Delaware Supreme. Court subsequently entered a

1G
17

18

judgment affirming that conviction and this Court granted
certiorari to review that judgment.
Two issues are raised in this proceeding.

First, are the standards of Miranda applicable to all

He was 'tried again after

trials, including retrials commenced after the decision was
announced.
Secondly, does the warrantless search of a suspect's
home based solely upon the consent of the co-occupant violate
the suspect's rights under the Fourth Amendment where he was
2

\

physically present and immediately available to give or withhold

2

his consent and where the purpose of the search was to obtain

3

evidence not against his cooccupant, but against the suspect

4

himselfo
The facts are not in dispute.

5

Indeed, the statement

S

of the case in the brief of the respondent is identical to that

7

of the petitioner’s brief.
In very summary form the facts are these.

8

9

On the

morning of March 17, 1965, officers of the Wilmington, Delaware,

10

Polifee Department were called to investigate an apparent

11

homicide.

12

The victim was found in a junkyard.
Subsequent examination of the body by the Assistant

13

Medical Examiner disclosed that the victim had died sometime

14

the prior evening.

15

observed on the street in the vicinity of that junkyard on

16

:ha£ prior evening.

The Petitioner and a companion had been

They had been apprehended and taken to the police
station where they were questioned by a Sergeant Maloney and
subsequently released.

Sergeant Maloney's name will come again.

Between 9 and 10 o'clock on the morning of March the
17th, that is the day after the initial apprehension, Sergeant
Maloney went with four other officers to the home of the
petitioner, his purpose was to see if the petitioner and his
oompansion of the prior evening were there.
The petitioner's lady friend, Miss Marshall, answered
3

I

the door and Sergeant Maloney indeed asked if Thornton Jenkins

?

the petitioner was present.

3

The petitioner and his companion, his lady-friend and

4

three other persons, being all of those present in the house,

5

were apprehended at that time and taken to the Detective Division

6

of the Police Station.

7

A big of geography might be of assistance here.

3

seems that all of the county and municipal functions in

9

Newcastle County, Delaware, are taken care of in a single

It

SO

building called the Public Building which has at one end the

11

city functions and at the other end its county functions.

12
13
34

The Police Station is located in the city end of the
Public Building.
At the Police Station the Petitioner was placed in a

15

so-called recording room located in the Detective Division.

16

At 11 o'clock that morning he was charged with night prowling.

17

At 11:40 that morning Sergeant Maloney, according to his

13

testimony, advised the petitioner's lady-friend of, in his

19

words, her rights and requested permission to search the house.

20

She told him that he could search the house which he

21

then did discovering items of junk and clothing which were

22

seized and later introduced into evidence at the trial.

23

return when we come to the subject of the validity of this

24

25

I will

search to some more specific facts on that issue.
Later that same afternoon at Is 15 p.m. the petitioner
4

I

was formally charged with fourth degree burglary andmurder in

■I

the first degree.
Subsequently, at 7 p„m. an incriminating written

3
4

statement was obtained from him.

15

was, of course, to verify what the police officers had already

8

concluded, namely that the petitioner was the person or at least

7

one of them who had committed the homicide then under investi­

3

gation .

9

The purpose of this confession

Although the evidence is conflicting upon what warn­

10

ings were given to the petitioner and when they were given

1!

regarding his Fifth Amendment rights -- the petitioner, for

12

example, insists that he was not given any warnings until after

13

he had signed the statement — it is clear that he was not ad­

14

vised of his right to have counsel supplied to him in the event

15

he wished and was unable to afford counsel.

16
17
13
19

Timely motions to suppress both the product of the
search and the statement were filed both before and during the
trials and were denied.
Petitioner's first trial began in January of 1966,

20

and his more recent trial in October of !67.

21

Petitioner's second trial in October of '67 which poses the

22

first issue raised here.

23
24
25

It was the

Following his initial conviction the Delaware Supreme
Court reversed for several reasons, none of them relating to
Petitioner's statement, and in so doing directed that although
5

1

the new trial was to be de novo the standards prescribed by-

z

Miranda were not to be applied,

3

Johnson held that Miranda would apply only to trials

4

begun after that decision, namely, Miranda was announced.

5

was not specifically concerned with and did not expressly hold

6

whether a retrial was among the trials in which Miranda was to

7

be applicable.

3
9

It.

For four major reasons we submit that the admissi™
ilitybof a criminal defendants incriminating statement at a

10

retrial should be measured by the same gage as any other de­

11

fendant going to trial at the same tim.

12

Very briefly those reasons are these.

13

First, the purpose of the Miranda rule is to enhance

14

the reliability of the fact-finding process at trial.

!5

purpose could not be fully implemented if it were applicable

16

only to some trials.

17

Now that

Here we think that the contrasting treatment in

18

Stovall of the way Gilbert rules is enlightening.

19

course, the critical time was fixed as the time of the con­

20
21

22

23
24
25

There, of

frontation, the time when the identification took place.
Here the time was fixed at trial.

Similarly in this

Court's recent decision in Fuller versus Alaska, in announcing
the applicability of the Lee versus Florida rule once again the
time was fixed, not the time that the officers obtained the
evidence in violation of Section 605 of the Federal Communication
6

i

Act, but at the time of trial.
\
And once again, however, no distinction is being made

2

3

as to the types of trial.

4

But certainly it would seem that if the rule in Lee

3

versus Florida as to which the Court said that it doesn't go

6

to the enhancement of the fact-finding process of the trial, it

7

is going to be applicable at trials subsequent to the time that

a

decision was announced.
It would seem anomalous to not apply at least in the

9
10

retrial context a rule which does go to the core of the fact­

11

finding process.
Our second reason is this.

12

In fixing the extent to

13

which there may be full effectuation of the individual's Fifth

14

Amendment rights to trial, the results of his prior in-custody

15

interrogation may

and frequently are determinative.

It is difficult if not impossible to distinguish

16
17

between the exercise of those rights during an in-custody inter­

S3

rogation and during trial.

19

in the interrogation process they cannot be fully exercised at

20

the trial„

2!
22
23

To the extent they have been lost

The choice of whether or not to testify may then not
be as a practical matter one which is open to the defendant.
The third reason is this.

There is a seeming impair­

24

ment of judicial integrity in sanctioning the simultaneous

25

trial by different persons in adjoining courts by different
7

1

standards»

z

but it appears to have as one of its purposes, the implemen­

3

tation of the Miranda protections as soon as possible but at

4

the same time minimizing any disruptive effect which would be

3

caused by its application»

3

And perhaps it is reading too much into Johnson,

That there would be some disruption is apparant»

7

Because Johnson would not exclude, or would exclude from evi­

3

dence those confessions which were obtained either prior to

9

the announcement of Miranda or indeed after it if they weren't

m

in compliance with Miranda standards provided that no trial of

in

any kind had been commenced by that date»

22

And fourth, there is an obvious point and perhaps too

m

obvious that where Johnson uses the word trials that is exactly

24

what was meant and no exclusion of all trials except a de­

15

fendant 's first appearance at the bar was intended.

16

Most of the decisions which are cited in all of the

17

briefs including that of the Amicus, Attorney General of the

18

State of New York, supporting the decision in accord with the

13

decision of the Delaware Supreme Court in this case, fixed the

20

critical word as cases, and what they have done with this word

22

is sometimes very interesting»

22

For example, in the case of Boone versus State —

23

correction, State versus Branch, the North Carolina decision

24

that the court there found that the word case was determinative

25

and held that a case begins at the time of the in-custody
8

i

interrogation and I suggest that that gives a substantial

2

warping to the Johnson decision.,

3
4
5

1 would like to make one or two brief comments upon
the brief of the

Amicus Curiae.

First the Amicus urges that the New York courts have

6

relied upon the nonapplicability of Miranda in reversing sub­

7

sequent cases.

3

because they had either been wrongly decided or for some other

9

error committed during the course of trial.

10

We would suggest that the cases were reversed

Secondly, it is argued that Miranda should not and I

11

am quoting,

12

retrial is ordered," which suggests that if a retrial is ordered,

13

there is no past conviction but only a future trial.

16
17

13
19

21

15be applied to past convictions merely because a

Finally, the Amicus contends that the primary aim of
Miranda was to change the circumstances of interrogation.

We

would suggest that that simply is not, but that is one of the
purposes but is not the primary purpose.
We turn now to the search and seizure question and
there I think some additional facts may be of assistance.

The

Petitioner and his lady~ftrend, Leona Marshall, had lived
together as man and wife for about three or four years prior to
his arrest.
They had lived in the house where the petitioner was
apprehended for a period of anywhere from, according to her
testimony, two of those years to perhaps nine months according

9

1

to the landlords.

z

Between 9 and 10 o'clock on the morning of March 17th,

3

some five officers of the Wilmington Police Department went

4

to the Petitioner's horae to apprehend the petitioner and his

3

compansion of the prior evening.

3

Sergeant Maloney knocked on the front door.

Miss

7

Marshall, still dressed in a housecoat, answered the door.

3

Sergeant Maloney asked for the Petitioner.

3

house were then collected in one of the rooms, which 1 think

The people in the

10

Sergeant Maloney described as a dining room, where Miss Marshall

11

observed Petitioner's companion being directed to lean against

12

the wall and. being padded down.
She was told to gat some clothes on and testified that

13
14

she was advised that the people in the house were going down

15

town.

They were taken to the Police Station.

16

All of those apprehended except for the Petitioner

!7

and his companion were seated on a bench immediately outside

18

the Detective Division portion of the Police Station.

19

Petitioner was taken inside and placed in a so-called recording

20

room which is a separate room within the larger confine of the

21

Detective Division.

22

The

Sergeant Maloney thereafter sought Miss Marshall's

23

permission to search the house.

The record is clear that at

24

that time Sergeant Maloney had Miss Marshall in custody.

25

knew that the Petitioner lived at the house to be searched.

He knew that
He proposed

For her part, Miss Marshall had a limited compre­

7

0

hension of what the search was all about and what her rights

9

were.

10

Basically she testified that she just didn't know what

it was ail about because the police didn't tell her.
She didn't know that she was not required to permit

11

12

a search.

She thought the police could search the property

13

simply because they wanted to and I think it is, I should say

14

too that she assumed that they could just get a search warrant

15

by some process that she didn’t understand but they could get

16

one.
In any event, as a result she did permit the search

17
18

for no reason really other than the police asked her to.

This

19

search, therefore, was without a warrant and was not conducted
/

20

incident to a lawful arrest.
The sole basis for its legitimacy was the acquiescence

21

22
23

of Miss Marshall, Petitioner's co-occupant in the request that.

Q

I see.

Okay,

A

IFhe acquiescence of Miss Marshall we suggest

doss not measure up to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment
for two basic reasons.
First of all, her positive response to a request for
permission of search was not made with any real comprehension
of what her Fourth Amendment rights were.
And secondly, irrespective of whether Miss Marshall's
12

1

permission to search effectively waived her own rights * we

z

submit that she could not vraive the Petitioner9 s rights and

3

even if it is assumed that a co-occupant simply because he is

4

a co-occupant can waive another's Fourth Amendment protections

5

the search here was nevertheless unreasonable where it was the

6

Petitioner who was the prime murder suspect where it was him

7

against whom evidence was being sought and where he was immedi­

3

ately available to give or withhold that consent.

9

Common to both reasons is the precept that a warrant­

10

less search is in vioMion of the Constitution unless it can

11

be demonstrated as being within one of the well-defined excep­

12

tions to the general requirement that a search must rest upon a

13
14

15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

search warrant.
Necessity may justify a search in certain circum­
stances but absent necessity a warrantless search must be
supported by a valid consent.
As to the first reasons, the insufficiency of Miss
Marshall's consent.
Like the Fifth Amendment, the aim of the Fourth is in
part certainly to avoid any compulsion upon the individual to
incriminate himself.

Evidence of a suspected crime whether

from the suspect’s own mouth or whether from his possessions or
his home have the same result.
If a waiver of this right is to be relied upon then
there is not appear to be any justification for surrounding
13

i

that right with a lesser degree of protection than is the case

2

for the Fifth Amendment,

3

Thus* if a waiver is to be relied upon it must be

4

established that Miss Marshall fully comprehended what her

3

rights were before her consent to the search can be charac­

3

terized as effective to support the search.

7

And the burden here of establishing that waiver is

3

upon the State.

In this case we submit that the burden has not

As to the second reason, as far as Petitioner is
aware, this Court has never up held the validity of a third
party consent to a search — let me state that another way.
As far as the Petitioner is aware this Court has never
specifically held that a third party can effectively waive the
Fourth Amendment rights of a defendant.
Once it is recognized that the Fourth Amendment pro­
tects people and not simply places or things and the rights of
tbs individual are personal rights, then it is difficult to
accept that those rights may be dismembered by one who has
absolutely no interest in their protection.
Anything else such as the possession and control rule
relied upon by the Delaware courts and many of the lower courts,
lower Federal Courts necessarily involves an analysis of
relative and competing property interest and makes them de­
terminative of who can consent to the search.
14

The waiver, therefore, must be by the person whose

1
2

rights are involved.

Either he must waive it in person or

3

:hrough an agent, but in either case the waiver or authority to

4

waive must be explicit and this we suggest is exactly what

5

Stoner teaches.
I think we would all be shocked and reject, out of

8
7

hand the notion that a father could waive his son's right to

3

a counsel in a trial and submit him on a plea of guilty to the

2

court for sentencing.
And I don’t think we could accept the wife's asserted

18
19

20
21

25

waiver of the husband’s Fifth Amendment rights.
we submit is really no different.

This situation

In a narrow sense it is

perhaps not essential for the disposition of this particular
case that the third party consent issue be met head on.

This

search was unreasonable by any standard despite Miss Marshall's
consent.
Avert once more the general rule that a search warrant
is required except where necessity changes that circumstance.
Absent a warrant the requirement of necessity in fact, even
though the decision and the petitioner fully appreciates this,
the decisions use the words reasonable and unreasonable.
If the requirement of necessity is not met then the
warrant is required.

Here there was no .reason, no justification

for not either seeking a warrant or seeking the Petitioner's
consent and the failure to sought that consent in this particular
15

i

instance where he was immediately available to give.or withhold

2

it, all that Sergeant Maloney had to do was to open the door

3

and ask him is what makes this search unreasonable.

4

Q

Well, assuming that Miss Marshall's consent was

3

valid and effective, if the police had entered the premises and

3

had found things there connecting her with the crime and she

7

had later been indicted, you wouldn't have any question about

3

the use of that, would you, against her?

9

A

Against her, no, I would not.

10

Q

Precisely, what is the complaint here?

Is it

n

that the police were not in good faith seeking her consent to

12

the search of the premises?

13

dealing with here is living space.

14

apartment?

13

A

16

Q

As I understand it what you are
Was it a house or an

It was an entire house, your Honor.
An entire house.

And she was the tenant although

17

the Petitioner paid the rent but she was the tenant and the

18

police wanted to search the entire house.

19

entire house and they carne across the junk, did they?

They searched the
■

20

A

Yes, sir.

21

Q

Was that in anything identifiable, or identified

£2

or identifiable as Petitioner's separate and private receptacle

23

such as a locked suitcase?
!

24
.25

A

No, it was not, your Honor.

We concede for

purposes of this argument that both the junk and the jacket
16
\

1

which were the clothing were in commonly occupied areas.
Q

2

All right.

But what you are really saying if

3

I correctly understand it is that apart from the question of

4

validity of her consent, assuming that her consent was valida

5

that the police would then be, were then warranted in searching

8

the premises but they were not warranted in using the fruits

1

of that search against Petitioner.

Is that it?

3

A

That is correct.

9

Q

An alternative would be to argue that the ob~
'

taining of her consent was not valid because she was not really j
10
11

the target of the search.

You are not . arguing that, are you?

12

A

Well, 1 am arguing that.

13

Q

Is there any authority for that?

14

A

I am arguing that that is what makes the search

15
16
17
18
19

20

unreasonable if the standard applicable and I concede to not
knowing • what the standard is.

23
24
23

If the standard is some general

and amorphous thing which we are just going to label reasonable
I say that this search was unreasonable by virtue of the fact
that in real terms the purpose of this search was to get
evidence against the Petitioner, not against the consenter.
Q

21

22

Yes, I am, your Honor.

What you are advocating if I understand it is

a very novel doctrine and that is that the consent has to be
obtained not from the person having some sort of possessory
or ownership rights, but from the person who is the target of
a search.

It is very difficult for me to relate your argument

17

i

to the conceptual standards in the field except in those terms

2

that you are asking us to abandon the possessory ownership

3

standard and the substitute for it a rule or to add to it

4

maybe, a rule that the police always have to obtain a consent

S

of the person who is the true target of the search before they

6

can make a warrantless search.
A

7

Mr. Justice Fortas, I wouldn’t go that far and

8

do not need to in this case.

But I do say that where "A" is

9

I think my answer was to the question if she was

her was proper.

The first question which wa are here to argue is
whether Miranda is applicable to retrial.

We have got five that agree with us, five States,

a

those 14 forums that differ with Delaware only one decision

and that is the California decision of People versus Doherty,,

4

has any more than a token discussion of this question.
The 13 other forums rely on the one word "trial" in

this Court's decision in Johnson versus Mew Jersey.
Now we submit that the answer to this question does

not lie in one little word used in one case.

that this Court reaches in this case shold be able to be

22

and not in *67 per your hypothetical.

23
24

25

But

It is merely a continuation or an extension of the
That is why the trial really began back in '65

I think another way to point this out v;ould be to say
if this Court started to write the decision in this case in
March of 1969, and after working on it one week you tore it up
21

1

then you come back in April of “69 and start to write it again

2

I think you would have to say that you began the work in March

3

of '69 and not in April of ’69=

4

Q

So your point is this is the same trial?

A

This is the same trial and it is part of the same

Is it a different judge*, a different jury,

different everything.

I might add that the only thing which is new about a new trial

is possibly the jury and well the jury is new, possibly the

judge might be new as well.

13

trial as far as the parties go.

14

But it certainly is not a new

The defense knows what the prosecution evidence is

15

going to be, they know the basis of the admissibility of that

easier to cross-examine the second time than the first time.

Theyknow how.the judge is going to rule on the

20

evidentiary questions.

21

except for the fact that the jury treats it as a new trial.

22

23

So a retrial is really not a new trial
The

Now, since all these other forums place such heavy

24

reliance on Johnson, I would like to just look a little bit at

25

some of the other language in the Johnson decision.
22

1

First, there was language in the Johnson decision

2

that Escobedo and Miranda should apply to cases commenced after

3

.hose decisions were announced»

4

Both words are important here,

8cases commenced.'

5

And New Jersey Supreme Court in Vigliano in discussing this

S

they say a retrial after appellate reversal is not a new case

7

but simply a continuance of the same case looking toward a

3

final judgment of either acquittal or conviction.

9
10

11

I think this is what I just expressed in answer to
Mr. Justice Marshall.
When a case commences it is my view that the case

'12

commences even before the previous trial.

33

of Maryland in Boone they put the commencing point at the

14

previous trial and the North Carolina Supreme Court in Branch

IS

they put it at the interrogation in the police station.

IS
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

The Supreme Court

I place the point of a case commencing at the first
cime the defendant is taken before a judicial officer to set
bail, whether that be a United States Commissioner or Justice
of the Peace or a Magistrate.
And the basis of that is that because this Court since
its inception has always held that to have a case there has
to be a controversy.

To have a controversy there has to be two

sides and the first point at which both sides are represented
before some judicial authority would be when you take him
before a Magistrate to set bail or for arraignment.
23

1

Now after the commencing we go through a preliminary

2

hearing, all part of the same case.

3

indictment, still part of the same case.

4

part of the same case.

3

Q

We go through a Grand Jury
Trial by petty jury,

Mr. Conner, 1 hate to stick to my point but it

S

seems to me your Court said on page 56, "Accordingly, the

7

opinion of the Court the Jenkins conviction of murder in the

9

first degree must be reversed and the case remanded for a new

9

trial."

A

19
11

Q

It is not binding on you?

This is the Supreme

Court of Delaware, right?
A

14
15

Well, that is language used in that decision;

yes, sir, Mr. Justice Marshall, but when you look at really —--

12

13

Not retrial.

Yes, sir,

But it goes to what is the definition

of a new trial,

16

Q

They did say new

trial.

17

A

They did say new

trial.

Q

All right.

A

But as Ihave just pointed out there is a big

18
19

20
21

and a great difference between a trial tried for the second
time than a trial tried for the first time.
Now, there is some additional language in Johnson

22
23
24

25

which is important and that language says future defendants will
benefit fully from our standards governing in-custody interro­
gation,

And they are talking about the' Miranda and Escobedo
24

3

standards»

2

back in March of 1965 was not a new or future defendant in

3

October 1967, when he was tried for the second time»

4

Now certainly Defendant Jenkins who was arrested

Now Johnson, in Johnson this Court also points out

5

that the police shouldn't be punished for not following stand­

5

ards which were not standards at the time they acted and this

7

Court differentiates from the map in Wolf Doctrine where the

8

police did have the Wolf standards but didn't follow them»

i?

So, if we consider that on a retrial the law enforce­

10

ment and the prosecution cannot use the confession, this would

11

really be to punish the police for acting in accordance with

12

the set standards at the time they took the confession»

33

Now, I mentioned at the beginning that this decision

34

should be reconcilable with the Johnson decision»

15

this Court determines as my friend asks that Miranda is

16

applicable to a retrial then this decision cannot be reconcilabl a

17

with the Johnson decision, because it is not reconcilable with

'18

19

Now, if

the language of case commenced»
Nov;, if the Court accepts our position, that it

20

should not apply to a retrial, it is reconcilcible with the

21

language, case commence.

22

the language trials begun by ruling that a retrial is merely

23

an extension and not a new trial, it can differ with the

24

Supreme Court of Delaware, or it could say by the language in

25

It can also be reconcilable with

Johnson, we intended this to mean a trial for the first time»
25

1

It can be reconciled, with Johnson.

Now this Court

a

has long been concerned about the administration of justice

3

and this is obvious not only from Johnson but from many other

4

decisions.

5

Many cases are going to be affected if it is ruled

6

that Miranda is applicable to a retrial.

indicates that many New York cases will be affected.

People versus Doherty.

Now In California they have a statute

which read something like this, "The granting of a new trial
places the parties in the. same position as if no trial had been
had."
This is very similar to the discussion which I just
27

1

had with Mr. Justice Marshall.

a

Courts are bound by this statute.

3

why they put a litle more discussion in about the Johnson case.

4

As 1 pointed out I don't agree with the statute because the

S

new trial doesn't really place the parties in the same position

0

as if no trial had been had for the reasons that have been

7

previously mentioned.

And, of course, the California
And this is one explanation

But it was also interesting to note that in the
Doherty case in California, the California Supreme Court ruled

10

hat the marijuana had been properly admitted into evidence, and

11

I feel that you can put the marijuana in the possession of

12

somebody that the Court may have felt that this was enough

13

evidence for them to get a conviction the second time without

14

the confession.

25

Q

Was the Doherty case in the California Supreme

Court decided before or after this Court's decision in Stovall?
A

Mr. Justice Stewart, I am not quite sura of

the Doherty date.
Q

I haven't read all of these cases in your foot­

notes 10, 11 and 12, but just a cursory glance at the dates of
the cases would indicate to me and perhaps I am wrong, that is
all I have done is glance at the date — would indicate that
perhaps more courts held Miranda to be applicable to a new
trial before this Court's decision in Stovall than did so
afterwards.
28

i

A

Yes, sir, I think the dates do indicate that»

z

People versus Doherty was in '67.

3

June of *67.,

I think Stovall came down in

4

Q

Also in '67 is my recollection.

3

A

It is very possible that Doherty was actually

6

argued and considered prior to June even though the written

7

opinion did not come out before.

3
3
10

Q

You don't remember whether the California Supreme

Court discusses the Stovall case in its opinion?

I think it

antedated the Stovall case.

i?

A

That is my recollection also, sir.

12

My next point which I was going to discuss was the

13

Stovall case.

14

lineup rules are concerned the way Gilbert rules that it is the

'15
16

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
23

Of course, Stovall held

that as far as the

date of confrontation which is the critical date.
But there is some other language in the Stovall
decision which I found interesting. And that language was, "We
conclude that for these purposes no distinction is justified
between convictions now final and convictions at various" —
and I emphasise various — "stages of trial and direct review.”
"Various stages of trial and direct review."
Now likewise in the confession area logic dictates
that no distinction is justified between the defendant who
confessed prior to June 13, 1966, was convicted, sentenced —■
served his sentence — and the defendant who also confessed
29

1

prior to June 13, 1966, was convicted but gets a new trial, for

a

reasons not related to the confession.

3

Secondly, logic dictates that the rules as far as

4

rights of counsel does not differ as far as a retrial is

3

concerned for identification cases and for confession cases.

6

Thirdly, and this may be reiterated and repetitious

7

but it should be emphasized, the police and law enforcement

8

should not be punished for something that wasn't the law at

9

the time they acted.

10

Now this concludes my portion of the argument which

1?

I want to deal with Miranda applying to retrial.

12

like to go briefly with what time is left into a discussion of

13

the principles that are involved in the search question or the

14

search aspect of this case.

15

16
17

Before going in this perhaps the factual setting
should be made clear.
Mr. Herndon alluded to the fact that they had lived

13

together for some years as man and wife.

19

recognize common-law marriages.

20

lived together.

21

rented these premises solely to Leona Marshall

22

he was concerned she was the tenant.

23
24
25

I would just

Delaware does not

It is true these people had

Thornton Jenkins.
It should also be pointed out that Thornton Jenkins
was arrested back in March 17th, 1965, and when this case came
30

!

to trial in January of '66, Leona Marshall was still residing

2

as tenant at these same premises.

3
4

So there is no dispute as to who is the tenant and
who has the property interest.

5

Our Supreme Court used the term, joint occupants.

6

Now, Mr. Herndon asked this Court to rule that in no

7

case can a defendant be bound when a third party consents to the

8

premise that the third party owns, were occupied, or has the

d

possessing interest in the search.

10

Now if you carry this argument ---

11

Q

Did he go that far?

12

A

Yes, sir, that was my impression from listening

13
14

to Mr. Herndon and reading the briefs.
But if you carry this position to the logical end

13

or logical extreme, it can't work.

25

Why can’t the police seize that suitcase?
A

If the person that owns the effects has wanted

to protect his privacy interest in these effects and goes to
the trouble to let us say enclose them and prevent them and keep
them out of the sight of the general public then that privacy
interest should be respected.
But when he comes in somebody's house and lays his
goods down in the open then he doesn't have much interest in
the privacy of this property and I think that is the answer.
34

So you couldn’t seize the suitcase but you

2

could seize the clothes in the suitcase if the suitcase was

3

lying open?

Q

If he had hid these things that they took so

that they were not immediately visible, would you say they

the fact that these things are right out in the open in the

3

home?
A

10
?1

Mr, Chief Justice, in this case I am going to

rest on the fact that these goods were all in the open.
Q

12

We have to go a little farther than that, don’t

13

we?

In determining what effect this will have on other cases

14

and you say they were right out there in the open, but I suppose

15

if the man takes things to his home and puts them in a room

16

that that doesn’t mean that even though theymight be observable

M

in that room that doesn't mean that he has no more privacy in

18

them S3far as the public is concerned, does it?
A

19

Well, I think if he takes, Mr„ Chief Justice,

20

if he takes them to his own home then he is seeking more

21

privacy.

22
23

24
25

Q

Isn't, this his home?

A

Well, when a man choosds to live inaan extra­

also goes to the question of privacy.

But it would have been all right if he would

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY N. HERNDON, JR., ESQ.

21

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HERNDON;

22

25

Mr. Chief Justice, if I may respond very

briefly.
As to the Johnson argument, I think that the position
of the State of Delaware points up the problem in using the
36

1

word case as the word of art rather than the word trial.

2

decisions in many States vary as to when a case or indeed

3

trial begins.

at the time of arraignment and plea, still others wheil a jury

is called into the box for examination, and still others when

8

the jury is sworn.

Some of the cases say that it begins with the

The

It

10

seems to us that the use of the word ’trial5 is a clearly

11

understood and well recognised word which provides a fine

12

degree of definiteness and one that should be easily followed,

13

despite the problems some courts have had with it.
It is suggested that this would punish the police

17

18

the critical word is case and unless case means the time

19

that the statement was taken.

what they have done properly at the time they obtained the
This is necessarily the consequence of Johnson in

It was further pointed out that this punishes the

21

police in that there was no anticipation of the problem and that

22

it was too late to go out and get any other evidence.

23

24
25

I would simply like to advert to the Petitioner's
motion to suppress in this case in December of '65 which
included the ground and certainly warned the police at that
37

1

time some few months after the event and this is a quote, "The

2

defendant was not adequately afforded the right to consult

3

with legal counsel and legal counsel was not assigned to

4

represent the defendant prior to the time his purported state-

S

ment was obtained thereby depriving the defendant of his right

6

to counsel.”

7

So there was a warning at that time and if there was

S

a problem and if there was further evidence that was the time

9

to have gotten it.

10

As to the search issue, I think I was understood to

11

make the representation or argument to the Court that in no

92

case can a third party consent to a search vis a vis the

13

defendant then I didn't state it well at all.

14

What I did say was that where the purpose of the

15

search is to obtain evidence against a defendant then the con­

16

sent of someone who simply has a proprietary interest in the

17

property to be searched is not sufficient.

18

And that was my point.

19

I have some concern about the aversion so some of

20

these in plain view cases.

21

we don't have a search and thereby the problem doesn’t arise.

Q

The obvious distinction there is

Well, then you would then contend that to take

23

your adversary’s hypothetical case that a robber who stashed

24

away stolen goods in an empty house in a summer resort and

25

left and that the owner of that house did not consent to a
38

j

1

search of the house because the object would be to get evidence

2

against the robber so you would say that he could not give

3

consent to the search, that anything found as a result of his

4

consent to the search of his own house could not be used

5

against the robber?

6

A

I would have trouble with that, your Honor, and

7

I would have trouble with it because I wonder whether or not

8

the robber at that juncture had not in fact abandoned that by

9

putting it in.

10

Q

I understood you to say that somebody with a

1?

proprietary interest in a house could not give consent to a

12

search if the purpose and object and target of the search was

13

to get evidence against somebody else.

Is that what you said?

14

A

That is what I have said.

15

Q

Well, that would cover the summer house case.

16

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Herndon, the Court

17

understands that you were appointed by the Court below to

18

represent this man as an indigent defendant and you have carried

19

the case on through this Court and we consider that to be a

20

real public service and we appreciate your having done that,

21

as we appreciate the service of all lawyers in that respect.

22

Mr. Conner, of course, we appreciate the diligent

23

manner in which you have represented the people of your State.

24

(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded and the Court recessed
until 10 a.m. Monday, March 10, 1969.)
