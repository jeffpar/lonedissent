hat thi, d.ne c2 thought,

wr,ile i c relie::: on tm:? constit11tion"l pro,risiops dealing

with freecom of mi~ration, brings m3 b ck ultimately ~o the
ecual protectio, clause and to the equal protc,ction clause
cases.
I ~tr~ss that ~,cause I think this unalysis 9ases
the Coui:t • 3 problem of dee.Ls ion

makes it unnecessa:cy

to brcal, now constitutional ground in thesa cases.
Por exw1plc, one doasn' 1; have uraer these circums.:ances to face up to the question of what ex.:ict clause of
the Consti.tution do you find this in.

23

the underlying thesis of that clause w s that a citizen of

one state should not be in a condition of alienage when he
is within or when he removes to another state.
I suggest the old notion of the Elizabethan

add that there are other check· on sources of money which

arc rr.c>de and this would bn checked along with that.
A w~y to tell,

I think, ~o illustrate how far-

fetcned this argumen;: is, is to suppose that a state woulC!
make it a crime, and I guess it is, to seek welfare in two

10

jurl;dictions, a.,d then to enact a tiubscction saying, "Whcever

20

applies for nid wlthin one year of mov~.ng into the state

21

shall be presumed to be conmitting fraud by seekinc;: payments

2c.

from two states."

23
24

Even a prim~ fac~e or rebuttal presumption of that
kind would unquestionably be struck down as arbitrary and
capricious, the same way as in Tot v. United States and other

Remember, all of ~he statutes that we mentioned
yesterday, with regard to all types of welfare programs,
have residency requirements therein.
In addition, is this Cour.t now prepared to establish
that welfa~e really is a right, and that in making~ program
