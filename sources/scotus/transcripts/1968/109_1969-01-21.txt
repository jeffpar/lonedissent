ORAL ARGUMENT OP CHARLES ALAN SEIGEL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

5
6

MR. SEIGEL:

Mr. Justice.

7

This was a case that was initially instituted in

8

the eastern district of Missouri by the petitioner brought

9

under the Federal Rule 23, the class action rules, seeking

10

to recover for herself and for some 4,000 members of her class

11

a judgment

in the amount $1,200,000.

12

The petitioner is the owner of some 2,000 shares

^3

of stock of the Missouri Union Fidelity Insurance Company.

14

In the petitioner's complaint it is alleged that the National

15

Western Life Insurance Companies entered into agreement with

16

the controlling members of the board of directors of the

17

Missouri Fidelity Union Trust Insurance Company whereby, that
'

18

the National Western agreed that they would buy some 300,000

19

shares of stock owned by the directors and members of the

20

directors' families for the premium price of $1,200,000 over

21

what the stock was selling for on the market, and the condition

22

was that these directors resign and that is what happened.

23

The directors did resign and the shares were purchased

24

and the nominees of National Western were then elected to

25

control the board of^directors and then were elected
j
2

control

i

I

of the executive committee and the financial committee.
The relief sought in the complaint was that this
3

$1,200,000 should be distributed to the shareholders of the

4

Missouri Onion Fidelity because that this was an illegal sale

5

of the offices of the directors and it was a breach of trust

6

owed by the directors to the stockholders.

7

The respondent filed a motion to dismiss taking the
position in the motion to dismiss that the claim of each member i

9

of the class was a separate and distinct claim and that inasmuch

10

as the claim, the respective amount of the petitioner's case.

11

x*as only $8,740 that the jurisdictional

12

not been mat.

amount of $10,000 had

The District Judge, the District Court, sustained

13
14

this motion.

This was affirmed- by the Court of Appeals and

15

Certiorari was applied for and granted to the Court on this

16

matter.

t

The sustaining of this motion to dismiss is what

17
18

made up the issues in this case.

The respondents claim that

IB

under the old rule, Federal Rule 23, and the cases decided

1

5

j
I

20
21

before

the Federal Rule 23, is that you could not aggregate
’
separate and distinct claims.
It is the position of the petitioner that amended

23

Rule, Federal Rule 23, does away completely with any designation

24

of separate and distinction claims and the undercover rule 23

25

there is provided for one action and one judgment binding on
3

1

the whole class except those who want to be excluded.

2

is no such thing as separate and distinct claims,, therefore,

3

aggregation is permitted.

4

There

Now, going into a little history, the United

5

States Constitution, Article 3, says that the judicial power

6

should be in one supreme court and such inferior courts as the

7

Congress should then designate.

8
©

The Section 2 o£ the Constitution provides that the
judicial powers should extend to matters of citisens of differe?

10

States.

Now, in the Judicial Act of 1789, there was set forth

1.1

by Congress the jurisdictional amount of $500 for jurisdiction
t

12

in District Courts; this has now been extended presently to

13

$10,000.

14

As might be expected, after it was set this jurisdie-\

15

tional amendment, there came the problem of what happens in

16

joinder cases and what happens in class action cases.

17

dopu computa the $10,000.

18

look at the statute.

19

said how it should be determined.

20

Constitution, so they, then looked to their rules, the, sruies

21

22

of common law and of equity practices as grew up as to joinder
«
equity practice and also the interpretation of the old Federal I

23

Rule 23, which really was a codification of the old rules of

24

common law joinder and of equity practices.

25

How

The courts then locked; they cannot

There was nothing in the statute that
There is nothing in the

As we go back and look at the common law rules of

!

i

joinder,, class actions and of equity practice? and as also is

2

codified in Federal Rule 23? we find that there was such

3

terms used as joint and common and separate and distinct»

4

The courts came down with this theory» They came

5

down with this theory not at the statutes? not the Constitution?

6

but at its own procedural rules? and they came with this

7

conclusion? that if there was a joint action? and that would be

&

an action? for example? when there was an interpretation of a

9

trust that would be binding and all the parties plaintiff.
This was a true class action and? therefore? aggrega­

10
11

tion should be permitted.

If there were separate and distinct

12

claims, such as the claims, we admit 'under the prior rule?
'

13

would be this particular case? that these could not be aggregate a

14

because there could be separate judgments and in every respect

IS

under Federal Rule 23? the old Federal 23? and under the

18

old equity and common lav; practice, even though there was a

17

joinder or class action when they were separate and distinct

18

claims, each claim maintained its own identity.

19

These joint and separate claims were called Spurious

20

claims and these claims the court would not allow aggregation?

21

and again? under Federal Rule 23? the old Federal Rule 23?

22

is that the only effect of a joinder in a class action where

23

there were separate and

24

who had a separate and distinct claim could intervene in the

25

action.

distinct claims was that the person

5

;

1

It was not binding on any other members of the

2

class unless the class member actually intervened in the action.

3

There could be separate and distinct judgments, there could

4

be a judgment for plaintiff and there could be judgment

5

against plaintiff.

6

In July of 1967 amended Rule 23 was passed and basica ly

7

amended Rule 23 provides for is that when the class is so

8

numerous that it would be impractical to join all the parties

S

involved and there are common questions of law and fact common

10

to the class and that their claims or defenses are common

11

to the class and that the petitioner will fairly represent

12

the class and that the questions of law and fact common to

13

the members of the class prevail over any question affecting

14

individual members then a class action may be maintained.

15

If a judgment is entered the rule specifically says:

16

"The judgment", it does not say “the judgments", "the judgment

17

in such an action", not "actions","shall describe the member

18

of the class and shall be binding on all members of the class

19

who do not notified by the court after being notified by the

20

court that the action is pending that they want to be excluded.'

21

So, as in this particular case, if the petitioner

22

was prevailed there would be one judgment in the amount of

23

$1,200,000 and which would be binding to all members of the

24

class except those members x^ho notified the court that they

25

did not want to be included in the judgment.
6

1

Q

What would they have left?

2

A

Mr. Justice, there would be distributed to

3

each member of the class his respective share.
Q

4

How about the ones who notified that they didn't

5

want to be part of the action?

S

by that action?
A

7
8

They would have retained the right to bring

their own independent action, Mr. Justice.
They could bring an independent action, for example,

©

10

What would they have retained

if they so desire.
Q

So there would be at least two actions, then,

13

A

There could be.

14

Q

And if 100 shareholders each said, "1 want to

15

That is correct.

stay out'1, there would be all of those 100 bringing their
.

16

own separate actions.

17

A

That is correct.

18

Q

And state their own cause of action.

19

A

That is correct.

20

Q

What if two of those 100 joined in one suit.

21

;

T#o parties of this class, two of the 100 who said,we don't

22

j
want to be part of this case, then brought,in their own names, |

23

their own actions against the company, each for ^5,000.

24

A

They could maintain that action.

25

Q

How could they do that?

7

A

1

Well, if they do not have the $10,000 jurisdic­

2

tional amount involved between them, then they would file the

3

suit in the State Court

Q

4

But, between them they do, but do you say that

5

two stockholders may aggregate if they join in one action

S

against the company?

Under the class action rules, yes*

a simple case of joinder of two plaintiffs, and that would not

fall under the class action rule and the old rules as far as

which now provides for one judgment binding on the whole class.

A

Mr. Justice, in the case that you mention, fchdre

10

would be, not one judgment, there would be two separate

17

judgments in a strictly permissive joinder case there is not

18

any provision for a single judgment, the^re would be a judgment

for each plaintiff-- ■

Q

But, nevertheless, when the lawsuit was over,

both parties would be bound.

f
*.

1
*

22

A

That is correct.

23

Q

And, furthermore, the issues of fact and law

24
25

are identical.
A

That is correct.
9

1

1 might point this out that? theoretically, in a

2

permissive joinder case, there could be different judgments,

3

whereas, in a class action under amended Rule 23, there cannot
\

4

be different judgments.
There is one judgment that is binding on the whole

5
6

class, and there is only one consistent judgment.

There cannot |

7

be separate judgments.for one member of the class and against
'

the other, because the rule says that if the claims or defenses
9

are not common, then there should not foe a class action rule.
o there is no possibility of an inconsistent judgment

10

under amended Rule 23.

1.6

Brother White's question indicated, you could have enough

17

stockholders saying, we don't want to be included, so that

18

the remaining group would not have the $10,000 jurisdictional

19

amount.

That is the practical

Of course, in theory you could have,as my

Actually, the position that you take construing the

20

21

rule wouldn't mean that any party could start a stockholders

22

derivative action, as a practical matter, and would not be

23

troubled by the jurisdictional requirement of the jurisdictional

24

amendment.

25

A

Mr. Justice, that would be so as long as the
10

1

aggregate amount of

2

Q

It is hardly worth bringing to suit»

3

A

That is correct.

The respondents have contended

4

that we must look to the old rules as to aggregation, the

5

old rules as to what the courts ~ the decisions of the courts

6

held that there could not be aggregation if there xvere separate

7

and distinct claims.
We must look to the old Federal rule, which had

8
9

\

this breakdown and used these terms, the carry-over from the

10

old common law and class actions of joint, common and several,

11

and that, as I indicated, if it was a joing claim, there

12

could foe adjudication but if it was several there,could not

13

foe.
Now, that is what respondents look to in support of

14

IS

their position.

But, now when the petitioner wants to look

16

at amended Rule 22 to find out there can be aggregation,the

17

respondents now claim that this is inviolation of Rule 82 of

.

'18
19

20

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which says that the
Federal Rules cannot expand Federal jurisdiction.
I submit that if the petitioner, in seeking to

21

justify aggregation

22

of expanding jurisdiction, then the respondents in looking at

23

the Court's interpretation of its own rules, its own common

24

law rules, equity rules, and old rule Federal 23 is also in

25

violation of the restrictions of the Rule 82 which says that

under the amended Rule 23, is in violation

not only must you not extend jurisdiction, you must

if we are expanding jurisdiction by

looking at amended rule 83, they are limiting jurisdiction by

looking at the old Federal Rule 23, and looking at the Court's

decisions which were handed down before the old Rule 23.

to site them all in one case.

The makers of the rule recognized this when they —•

1

2

in their statements — that they were doing away completely

3

■with these terms, joint, common, several, true, spurious and

4

hybrid actions.

5

Rule 23 would provide for only one action.

6

going to be no longer looked to.

These would be done away and new amended
These terms were

I submit that if we take the interpret a t:ion,as

7
8

urged by the respondents in this case, that there would

9

seldom be brought an action under the amended class action

50

rule.

.That is for this reason;

n

amended Rule 23 is that the class be so numerous that it

12

would be impractical to bring them all before the Court.

13

I cannot think of any case that I have read .or

very

The first requirement of

14

heard about in which there was so many people that suffered

15

any dependent damages of $10,000 that they could not be brought

16

before the Court, and in most of the cases, such as the case

17

we are talking about, you find persons who have sustained
*

18

damages of $500, of $1,000, in our case, $8,740, but in very

19

fextf cases will you find so many people that it would be

20

impractical to bring to Court each one of them who has shstainec,! a

21

$10,000 damage.

22

Therefore, the position urged by the respondents

23

really completely makes Rule 23, amended Rule 23, annulled.

24

It will never be used, and I suggest and urge this Court

25

that the interpretation urged by the petitioner foe adopted.

13

That was the intention of the framers of the rule,

<*
£

2

that small litigants have a form to litigate their claims and

3

that under the Federal amended Rule 23 that there would be

4

one action, one judgment, binding on all the members of the

5

class who have not chosen to be excluded, and, certainly, in

6

this Case, that amount would be far in excess of the $10,000
j urisdictional amount.

There could be a forum, but X

think that the litigants are entitled to an impartial forum
as provided for by the diversity of the citizenship provisions

work because each person under the old rule, there being 'separate

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES L. ZEMELMAN, ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

10

MR. ZEMELMANt

.

11

Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the

Court:

12

I would like to first direct the Court's attention

.

13

to one particular position in our prosecution of this matter.

14

That is, and I will start out with the history of the aggregatir

m

doctrine,

16

conclusion that the doctrine, that is the aggregation doctrine

17

is not tied to the Federal rules of Federal Rules of Civil

18

Procedure.

leads us, as the respondents, to the inescapable

The aggregation doctrine began approximately 100

19
20

year prior to the time that our Federal rules were enacted.

21

‘irhe jurisdiction of our lower courts was established by the

22

legislature and from time to time modified and amended until

23

such time as it reached the $10,000 limitation that it presently

24

has.

25

Admittedly, when the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
16

*■
t

a

t

£*

were amended,, there was an effort on the part of the advisory
committee to give, it seems to me, the Federal District' Courts, j
.

3

j

wider discretion as to the type, the latitude,that they could
'

4

choose in applying any sort of joinder application»

5

Nevertheless, it is our contention, and it has been

S

our contention from the beginning, that this amendment to

7

Rule

S

call hybrids, spurious and true and those, I remind this

9

Court, were creations, I think, of the writers rather than of

23, although it does away with the designations we

10

the courts, nevertheless, they have to foe used today as some

form of a guideline.

12

Mr. Justice White asked my opponent as to what

t3

procedure might be evolved in the event various of the parties

U

within a class should seek to remove themselves from that

15

class, and clearly, as we have pointed out in our brief, the

16

possibility is that the final remaining or remaining parties

17

would not have the jurisdictional limit.

18

I think that the intention of

the Federal rules
■

19

was not to determine whether or not the party litigant could

20

get into Court, but, rather, what procedure might be used to

21

simplify the approach that the Court to take to the handling

22

of the various litigation before it.

f

23

The jurisdictional limits that are imposed upon the

24

Courts must be viewed first, and, in this instance, it is a

25

$10,000 limitation.

The plaintiff in this case, by the

17

j

I

admission of counsel, has only approximately an $8,000 claim

2

and that only By aggregation could she have, as a forum, the

3

Federal Court»
She is not without a forum.

4

The Missouri Rules of

5

Civil Procedure, as set out in our brief, provide the same

6

or comparable provision as did Rule 23 prior to its amendment.
It would be my understanding that the simple result

7
8

of the amendment to the rule was to promulgate a more practical

9

working .of the class procedure.
It enabled the Court to determine whether ox not

10

n
• 12

a matter fell within a class action procedures and' would be
appropriate to that court.

But prior to making that determina-

1.3

felon, it seems to me, that this Court, or any court, has to

14

determine whether or not the jurisdictional requirements are

15

met.

16

Counsel has sugqested that we might be talking about

17

a limiting factor by invoking Rule 82,

Federal Rule 82 says,

18

and X quote in part, that: "The jurisdiction shall not be

19

extended or limited,

i

20

X am not suggesting to this Court that we are

21

talking about any limitation.

22

by the present statutory enactment being the $10,000 limitation.

23

We are suggesting that the Court is not changing that.

24

are merely suggesting that if

25

The limitation is in existence

We

petitioners‘ application were

applied here, that any number of people with separate and

1

distinct claims with common matters of law, in fact, could

2

join in and bring a causa before the Court.
In the Federal District Court in making its decision

3
4

in this matter, it referred to the Pinel case and we, subse­

5

quently, called the Court's attention to Troy Bank of Troy,

6

Indiana

7

versus G. A. Whitehead.
In that case, probably, the aggregation doctrine

8

is more clearly defined than in any I have read.

It points

9

out that when two or more plaintiffs having separate and

10

distinct deiaand unite for convenience and economy in a single

11

suit, it is essential that the demand of each be of the.

12

requisite jurisdictional amount.

13

Clearly, in this case, this plaintiff, bringing of

.14

this lawsuit, on her own, seeking the $8,000 based upon her

IS

2,000 shares does not have a forum in the Federal Court.

16

is not limited from a day in

17

our understanding, of the forum of this Court, or of the

18

Federal Courts.

19

Q

2©urt,

Is the claim in the present case, peculiarly,

20

a derivative claim, that is to say, a claim of the corporation

21

against some of its officers and directors?

22

A

Mr. Justice, it is not.

This is a class action

23

claim that has been brought, not under the derivative proceed­

24

ings of the Federal Court.

25

There is a derivcitive suit that

has been filed, and I would point that out to this Court, by a
19

1

shareholder in the State

courts of Missouri.

In addition, this particular petitioner has filed

2
3

cases in the District Court in the State of California and

4

in the District Court in the State . of Wisconsin, one of

5

which was dismissed, the California case? the Wisconsin case

6

following the holding of the 10th Circuit in the Gas Service

7

Case, and accepting that proposition determined that the

S

10

action was properly brought, and overruling, so to speak, the

decision of the 8th Circuit Court in our ease and in the 5th

A

This would take some thought.

But it would

19

appear that if it was the corporation that were seeking the

20

fund -- if the fund was to be sought for the corporation and

21

no singular stockholder* and I think this is an important

That is right.

In that situation* it would

from the corporation were $1,200 ,,000, they would reach the

In other words, I believe that the question is

That is really what I am asking you.

Well, I am not certain that I agree with you,

Mr. Justice, that the same procedure would be followed In a

If this is the excuse that is going to be used to

iz

out, among other things that the increase in 1958 of the

slight effect on the workload of the .judicially»

If this effort on the part of petitioner to invoke

that they claim, then I can see that this Court will be flooded,

There are two cases in Illinois which go in opposite routes.

It would be our position that the Booth versus General Dynamics

case which seems to permit an aggregation, actually, was

8

viewed in Lesch case, also cited in our brief, and recognised

9

by the Lesch case as reaching an improper result.

I would also like to call this Court's attention to
the Gas Service Company case.

its result, at least in our determination, in relying on the
Gibbs versus Buck case, has misconstrued the decision of
that case, but that", in fact, in. that case, an examination
shows that all of the parties that were petitioners to that
case had the requisite jurisdictional amount, so that there
was no question here as to whether aggregation was required.
It seems to me that the Buck case, Gibbs versus
Buck case, reiterates and reaffirms the earlier and later
decisions of this Court that the aggregation doctrine is a
well-thought of and a we 11-situated doctrine

that should not

be wiped away, and I would suggest to this Court that if
the Court feels that amended Rule 23-B permits this, then
what the Court is doing is in one swoop is wiping out' the

respondents said, yes, it does, but under the theory here
:

it would not because stil each — under their theory, for
each member of the class you would have to have $10,000.

find a class action,as we think of a class action, where there
has been so many people that have sustained $10,000 loss.

Q

Did Mr. Zemelman argue that each one of them

had to have $10,000 interest or that one had to have $10,000

and then he could aggregate?

Mr. Justice, on being questioned here by

Mr.

amount and, so —~

That is not a class action»

i
That appears, from the language, at least, to foe simple joinder
A

That is correct, Mr, Justice, but it is the

position of the respondents in this case that the rules for
aggregation for joinder apply for class action»
Under the old Rule 23 it was really no more than a
30

I

n

1

joinder action»

2

really the first class action, as we think of it, that the

3

Federal Court has ever had.

n

So, in interpreting —the amended Rule 23 is

The old Rule 23 was no more than a permissive joinder.

3

because when there was separate distinct claims of common

6

questions of law, all it does was to give a person having a

7

separate and distinct claim, the right to come into the Court

8

and, join, and any judgment — there would be separate judgments

0

and it would not bind any of the members of the class*

.

10

i

It

was not a class action--Q

11

But isn't it also true that the old rule require®

12

that the named plaintiff, for example, a spurious class suit,

13
14

the named plaintiff must have all, all, emphasize, underscore,
■
•*
jurisdictional qualifications tc maintain the action as an

15

individual; isn't that the old rule?

A

16

Mr. Justice, the rule does not so state.

That-

17

was the interpretation that was given by the courts, not by

18

looking at the rule, or not looking at any statute, by looking

19

at the old principles of what was a joint claim and what was

20

a

21

common claim.
Q

i

There is nothing in the rule ---

But the spurious class action required that.

22

That,first, plaintiff had to be diversity, $10,000 plus, $3,000j,

23

it Was then, plus, of age and everything, and then the class

24

was a mass outside someplace.

If yon follow that, the only changes that

you could argue for would be that the one person would have
