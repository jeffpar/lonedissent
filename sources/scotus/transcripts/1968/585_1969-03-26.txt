ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD J. SIMERKA, ESQ.

MR. SIMERKA:

into the reason why we are here.
In December of 1965, the Teamsters lost an NLRB
election which was held among employees classified as
journeymen Wire Weavers at our applicant plant in Holyoke,
Massachusetts.
They voted

Mr. Chief Justice and members of the

Court, may it please the Court, we would like to get immediately

Mr. Simerka.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

9

Counsel are present.

Labor Board ordered us to bargain with it.
Labor Board do this?

And why did the

They did it because of our words, because

of what we said to our employees prior to the conduct of this
election.
Unlike the other cases that have been heard this
afternoon there were no discharges.
There was no surveillance.

There was no interrogation.

There were no promises of benefit

by the employer in this case.
2

t

Now during the organising campaign# the President#

2

David Sinclair# made two speeches to the employees and he wrote

3

about eight letters for handbills.

4

Board could not find a single statement# couldn’t find a single

5

sentence or a single communication which they could charac­

6

terize as being unlawful.

7

Now in its decision# the

So instead, what the Board said, in effect, was that

8

even though each of the employer’s statement was lawful by

9

itself, considered subsequently# we, the Board in our expertise

10

sitting here in Washington will decide that the totality of

11

all these lawful statements, however, are unlawful and are

12

coercive and that is why we are here.

13

It is our position that our communications to our

14

employees were lawful and protected and not only by Section

15

8(c) of the Taft-Harley Act but also by the First Amendment

16

to the Constitution.

17

We would like to meet the issues head-on, and if I

18

may I would like to direct the Court's attention to page 21

19

of the Board's brief.

20
21

22
23
24
25

The Board's attorney call attention on page 21 of
their brief to f.i-e points that allegedly were made by
President Sinclair in petitioner's communication.

1 am using

the term Board's attorney advisedly because the Board nowhere
indicated that it relied on these five points or upon any
other points.
3

1

The only finding that we have from the Board is

2

that by Petitioner's series of communications that when they

3

were considered as a whole that these were coercive but the

4

Board at no time ever indicated as to what it was specifically

5

that we had said that merited prescription.

6

That is why 1 point to page 21 of the Board's brief
i

7

because the Board’s attorney point to five points which they

8

say we made and it is these five points I gather which

9

allegedly made our communication coercive in the Board's view.

10

Now, of course, the Board's attorneys merely expanded,

11

upon an approach taken by the Court below which did much the

12

same thing, relying on four points. Again, there is no

13

evidence relied on by the Board.

14

Now we submit that each of the five statements or

15

points that are referred to iLh .the Board's brief were lawful

16

and protected by Section 8(c) and by the First Amendment to

17

the Constitution.

18

Point No. 1, for example, is that the 1952 strike

19

left the company in a state of continuing financial difficulty.

20

Now, of course, the facts in our case are that we did have a

21

union for journeymen and at that time apprentice wire weavers

22

up until 1952 when there was a 13-week strike.

23

And then our communication told the employees that

24

the 1952 strike of 13-week's duration had left the company in

25

a continuing state of financial difficulty and we submit
4

1

that this statement is perfectly lawful and proper under

2

Section 8(c) of the Act»

3

By no stretch of the imagination can it be claimed

4

to contain a threat of force or reprisal on our part and

5

certainly is not a promise of benefit.

6

Further the statment is amply supported by the

7

record and I point out that this Court has held that no test

8

of truth can be administered either by judges or juries or

9

by administrative agencies when questions of free speech are

10

involved, but the record does support this statement and it

11

shows that the financial difficulties over the years became

12

so severe that in 1964 President David Sinclair was forced to

13

sell.

14

Now we assume that even the Board will agree with us

15

that statement No. 1 which the Board is relying on is a state­

16

ment lawful and protected under 8(c) and under the First

17

Amendment„

18

Q

What page of the brief did you say that was on?

19

A

It is on page 21, your Honor, of the Board's

20

brief.
The second statement that the Board relies upon is

21

22

a statement that the petitioner stated that a union would make

23

unreasonable demands which the company couldnot meet.

24

then its

25

going to quibble over the wording.

only recourse would be a strike.

5

And

Well, I am not

I

We made a statement substantially of that nature in

2

the course of a pre-election campaign.

3

one knows that this statement, that is, that if the company

4

cannot meet unreasonable demand that the union’s only recourse

5

is a strike, is a true statement.

e

But we submit that any­

It doesn’t take Board

Now, we submit that a statement of this nature also

is lawful and protected under Section 8(c) and the First

9

Amendment to the Constitution. To the extent there may be

to

involved a charge that a union or the union or the Teamsters

1?

Union would make an unreasonable demand we submit that this is

12

lawful and protected.
It is a statement relevant to the issues.

13

And in

14

Linn against Plant Guards this Court recognized that a wide

15

scope was to be given in a pre-election campaign with charges

16

and counter-charges. And it doesn't take Board expertise to

17

know that unions do make unreasonable demands.

18

that.

This is the name of the game.
This is the basis upon which negotiations start in

19
20

any labor-management context.

because they had all been union members.

I should amend my statement.

A majority of them

24

have been members of the union back in 1952 and anyone who

25

negotiates labor contracts as I have know that,, also.
6

1

Now, in addition, here there was a background of a

2

strike oyer unreasonable demands in 1952=,

3

the employees involved in this election campaign went through

4

the 1952 strike.

5

back in 1952 that led to that strike.

The majority of

They knew what the unreasonable demands were

We submit that neither 8(c) nor the Constitution

6
7

permits the Board to shield employees from something they

8

already know.

9

No. 2 which is relied upon by the Board.

Basically this is the substance of statement

Now, what else did we do according to the Board's

10
51

attorneys?

12

pointed out to the employees that such a recourse, that is,

13

unreasonable demand was to be expected from the Teamsters

14

Union which was a strike-happy outfit led by racketeers.

Three, according to the Board's attorneys we

Again, your Honors, we submit that there is no threat

15
16

or force or reprisal in this statement and that it is fully

17

protected by Section 8(c) and by the First Amendment to the

18

Constitution.
Now, what does the record show with regard to facts?

19

20

It shows first of all that the union that was organizing us

21

was in effect the same union that struck us for 13 weeks in

22

1952.

23
24
25

In 1952 our people were represented by the AWWPA,
the American Wire Weavers Protective Association which had
merged with or been absorbed by the Teamers Wire Weavers
7

1

Division which was the entity within the Teamsters Union that

2

sent the initial letter to our employees and began its attempt

3

to organise them in July 1965»
So the AWWPA which had been swallowed up by the

4
5

Teamsters was the organizing entity,

The authorization cards

6

sent out to the employees authorized the International Union

7

to represent these people and it also authorized the Inter­

8

national to designate or charter any other local to represent

9

them.
The organizational attempts started with the Inter­

10

national and the first recognition demand came from the

11

International on August 17„

12

It was a request made not only by

the International but on behalf of the International as shown

13

by cmr response to it,,

14

Any statements with respect to racketeering is

15

certainly amply supported by Senator Kennedy's book, The Enemy

16

Within, which we sent to our employees had records of Senate

17

investigating committees and the reference to the Teamsters

18

being a strike-happy outfit was supported in our letter to

19

our employees by our "Directly from Mr. Hoffa himself,” in

20

connection with an organizing campaign among telephone in­

21

stallers where he told these people that either they should

22

be ready to do warfare with their employer for six or nine

23

months or not come into the Teamsters Union at all.

24

We submit that certainly we have a right to

25

8
i

1

disseminate these facts to our employees with respect to the

2

Teamsters Union.,

3

We submit that our statements were lawful under Section 8(c)

4

and under the First Amendment„
Q

5
6

with you?

And both the Board and the Court below disagreed
Is that right?

A

7

There is no threat of force or reprisal.,

The Board, yes, based on its totality doctrine

8

the Board did not as I pointed out earlier, did not take these

9

five points because they did not tell us what it was we had

10
11
12

13

said.
The Board said merely through their expertise the
totality of our communication were coercive.
The Court of Appeals did follow- this type of analysis

14

and set forth four different points which we submit do not

15

support the Board's order in any event or its findings.

16

However, the Court below merely deferred to the

17

Board's expertise and to the test of substantial evidence and

18

we submit that in both of these respects the Board expertise

19

was not a proper standard and, of course, should have reviewed

20

the record itself to determine whether or not there were any

21

improper statements and that substantiality of the evidence

22
23
24
25

was not a criterion, particularly here when the facts were
undisputed and all that was involved were the interpretation
or conclusions to be drawn from the facts.
Again, I point to this Court's decision in Linn
9

1

against Plant Guards where this

2

great leeway was to be afforded to the combatants or contestants

3

in a pre-election campaign for vigorous vehement and caustic

4

commento

Court pointed out that a

S

Now apparently the Board's attorneys do not consider

6

that points 1*, 2 and 3 add up to an unlawful totality, because

7

they have gone on to No. 5,

0

would not be sufficient in the Board’s view to constitute a

9

violation of the Act„

And 1 assume that 1, 2 and 3

The fourth point the Board points to is a statement

1G
11

to the effect that another strike could result in closing of

12

a plant, as Lindsay would shift work to its Mississippi and

13

Ohio plants if the Sinclair Company did not make a profit.

14

Q

What was the charge in this case?

15

A

The charge in this case, your Honor?

16

Q

The unfair labor practice charge?

17

A

The charge is an 8(a)(1) charge.

18

there were charges of 8(a)(1), (3) and (5).

19

never litigated.

23

25

It was dismissed administratively.

8(a)(5).

22

24

The 8(a)(3) was

Then the hearing proceeded on charge of 8(a)(1) and

20
21

Initially

Q

Yes.

A

And the 8(a)(5) charge, of course, is based

wholly and solely on the evidence again of our words to our
employees.

There is not a scintilla of evidence.
10

1

2

Q

What is the basis for holding that you violated

8(a)(1) because you violated 8(a)(5)?

3

A

No, it is the other way around,

4

Q

That is what I thought.

5

6

This is an independent violation of 8(a)(1),
without the words you use violated 8(a) work,

7
3
9
10

A

Right, then the same words are used by the

Q

What is the rationale for saying that without

Board,

violating the other sections you can violate 8(a)(1)?

11

A

I am not sure that I follow.

12

Q

They said the words you use violated 8(a)(1).

13

A

Yes.

The Board's theory is that a violation of

14

8(a)(5), for example, or 8(a)(3) -- or I should put it the

15

other way a violation of 8(a)(1) is subsumed in a violation

16

of 8(a)(3), for example.

17

If there is an unlawful discharge this violates not

18

only 8(a)(3) but also 8(a)(1).

19

turning it around.

20
21

22
23
24
25

In this case the Board is

They say that a violation of 8(a)(1), of 8(a)(5)
I should say, is subsumed in the violation of 8(a)(1).
Q

I think they are saying that because you

violated 8(a)(1) you refused to bargain by not recognizing the
authorization cards because by the violation of 8(a)(1) you
have really vitiated the chances of a fair election.
11

Specifically? what is the rationale for saying you

1

2

violated 8(a)(1) by using some words against the employers

3

when you haven’t violated 8(a)(3)?
It is just this coercive?

4
5

word?

6

tell me why is this form of words violate 8(a)(1)?

7

sections of rights are being interfered with by using these

8

words?
A

9
10

This violates 8(a)(1)?

Any kind of coercive

Well, forget 8(a)(3).

Just
What

Well, it is our contention that nothing that

we said violated Section 8(a)(1).

11

Q

What is the Board's view of it, do you know?

12

A

We have sought in vain, your Honor, to try to

13

find out what the Board's view is.

14

decision does not tellus.

15
16
17
18

19

20
21

22

25

Q

They said it was coercive?

A

They collected a series of little excerpts from

what we said and they listed them in their opinion and then
they said all of these foregoing speeches and communications
when considered as a whole are unlawful.

Then the Board made

one finding relating to July 5 to December 9, the date of the
election and made a second finding that related only to the
period from November 8 to December 9.
And The Board reached the same conclusion in both

23
24

Because the Board's

cases.

The second finding limiting it from November 8 to

December 9 was made initially for the purpose of establishing
12

I
2

findings upon which the election could be set aside,
Because Jackson’s conduct is not considered as

3

justifying setting aside an election unless it occurs on or

4

after the date the election petition is filed.

5

the reason for the November 8 date.

6

So that is

Other than the Board’s statement that the totality

7

of our communications violated the act we have no way of

3

knowing what the basis of this conclusion is.

9

The Board never pointed to any specific statement

10

and said, on such and such date you made a certain statement

11

and this statement threatened or coerced the employees or

12

that you threatened reprisals and the facts are completely

13

to the contrary which the Board has completely ignored because

14

we repeatedly told our people that we would not close our

15

plant and that we would fulfill our duty to bargain with the

16

union if they selected one.

17

The entire thrust of our conversations with our

18

people was that there was a possibility that if this same

19

union that had once represented our people and had already

20

once before called a strike over unreasonable demands, if

21

this union came in and did the same thing then there was a

22

possibility that there would be adverse consequences to all

23

concerned because the company was not in position to agree

24

to any unreasonable demand.

25

Now the Board characterizes our comments as predictions
13

1

Well, there is nothing in what we said where we even went so

2

far as to predict that anything of this nature would result»

3

We never predicted»

4

a possibility that if the union was selected and if the union

5

made unreasonable demands upon us in negotiating context and

6

if we were unable to meet these demands and if they called a

7

strike then there was a possibility that this plant might

8

close.

9
10
1?

12

13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

We discussed the possibility.

It was

We never predicted that any of this would happen.
We repeatedly said we did not intend to close.

President

Sinclair repeatedly indicated to the employees that what was
involved was his life.

It was his job.

It was his family

business and his final speech to the employees he said that
he would do his level best to keep the Sinclair Company in
business and growing.
So we submit that the Board’s finding based upon a
totality are not supported by the evidence.

Our statements

are constitutionally protected and are protected by Section
8(c) and there are no threats of reprisal, of course, in
anything we said.
Now, in this regard, we point to Senator Taft's
explanation in the two legislative history 1627 which we have
cited in pages 67 and 68 of our brief where Senator Taft in
explaining Section 8(c) said that views, argument or opinion
shall not be evidence of

an unfair labor practice unless they
14

?

contain in themselves a threat of coercion or a promise of

2

benefit»

3

The Board is urging before this court a subjective

4

task as to regard Section 8(c) as to what the listener be­

5

lieved which amounts to reading Section 8{c) out of the Act

6

entirely»

7

And it would again turn all speech questions in

8

labor members over to Board expertise and we submit that this

9

is what Congress attempted to prevent when it enacted

to
11

Section 8(c) in the first place»
And this is what the Board has done here in this case,

12

attempted to substitute expertise for evidence.

13

that our lawful statements cannot be added up to an. unlawful

14

totality through Board expertise.

15

We submit

If this can be done by other Boards, they don't

16

have to make any findings, if they don’t have to find that a

17

statement is a threat and show that this is supported by

18

evidence, then we submit that we will have a monster of

19

expertise which this court shunned in the Burlington case.

20

Q

Well, if you had said to the employees, if you

21

join this tough aggressive union, then we are going to move

22

the plant south.

23

of the statute?

24
25

A

Would that be coercion in the condemnation

I think if the statement was made if you join

such and such union, the plant will be moved south, well I
15

1

would say that that was a direct threat to the employees»
Q

2

So that the one possibility here is the Board

3

whether or not whatever you may call it, expertise or what,

4

the Board may have considered that the statement in context

5

amounted to that kind of a statement?

8

Is that possible?

7

A

Well, your Honor —-

8

Q

And what you are asking us to do is to go

9
10
11

through this language that was used and say that the Board was
wrong in putting a sinister interpretation on what was nansinister language,

12

13
14

17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

In substance that is our position, yes,

Q

You have another point about the authorization

cards, don't you?

A

A

You mean on the bargaining order aspects of

Q

Yes,

A

Yes, there is another point in that regard.

the case?

The Board in this case having found they committed
an 8(a)(1) violation as I said earlier, subsume an 8(a)(5)
violation in the 8(a)(1) because there was no other evidence
in this case other than the evidence of our words.
And they used our words then as evidence of a number
of other things.

They used our words in their finding of

Section 8(a)(1) as evidence that we did not have a good faith
16

1

2

doubt of the union majority status.
Also, that we did not have a good faith doubt of

3

the appropriate unit.

4

to defeat the union.

5

that we caused the union to lose support and finally the final

6

and most important finding which the Board made specifically

7

in this case that it would be impossible to conduct a fair

8

second election.

9

That we sought to gain time in order
That we through our communications

Of course, the Board does this through a boot­

10

strapping technique having found the 8(a)(1) they automatically

11

arrive at the 8(a)(5) because the Board claims the right to

12

infer all these findings of the 8(a)(1).

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

We submit that there

is no logical basis for this kind of inference.
I would like to just add a few more comments because
my time is about up.
To try to summarize on the bargaining order aspects oi
the case it it our contention that the question of good faith
doubt is really irrelevant and that the Board said so itself
in this case.
In its order the Board said that even if we had
had a good faith doubt that they would nevertheless have
ordered us to bargain anyway.

So that the Board itself says

that the question of good faith doubt is irrelevant.

I think

the important aspect in this case and in the others of
bargaining order of question is what is the proper remedy for
17

Yes.

Q

There is no reference here as to whether or not

you would have a doubt.

I don't find it in that language,

do you?
A

No, it is not in that line.

Q

It is somewhere else?

A

It is in the order.

Q

Oh, in the order.

A

Yes, it is in the Board's order and discussions.
18

I beg your pardon.

Not in the order itself,, in the discussion the Board says

2

that even if we had had a good faith doubt in this case they

would have ordered us to bargain in any event»

Did the Board itself write an opinion?

No.

Where is this discussion, in the Board’s brief?

No, sir.

Well, that is what I was referring to.

It is page 198, your Honor.

15

Q

What, 198?

16

A

Yes.

It starts about the sixth line down,

17

"Moreover I would recommend the same bargaining order even if

18

the record had warned of the conclusion ..."

19

Q

Thank you.

Yes.

20

Q

Did I understand you to concede that if the

21

company had made a statement that if the union won it intended

22

to move its plant and that was a truthful statement, that that

23

would have been ground for holding coercion?

24

A

I didn’t get the last words, your HOnor.

25

Q

That, would have been ground for holding if
19

1

there was coercion on the employees?

2

A

Well, I would say that if an employer goes to

3

employees and says if you vote for this union I will move the

4

plant out that this could be considered a threat under

5

Section 8(c) of the Act»

6

Q

Suppose it was the truth?

7

A

Well, pardon me?

8

Q

Suppose it was the truth?

A

Well, I would say that this would be a threat

to

under 8(c) and could be considered coercive»
Q

12

That is what I asked»

In other words, he couldn't tell them what he

was going to do if they won, if the unions won?

13

A

Well, of course, that would --

14

Q

If he really intended to do it»

15

A

It — you would have to consider the fact of

16

the Darlington case or the Darlington decision of this Court

17

as to whether or not you would be legally entitled to make

18

this statement.
Q

19

20

A

Yes, I would say that if an employer made a

flat statement to employees that if you vote for the union ——

23
24
25

I just

ask you what you conceded.

21

22

I don’t say that one way or the other.

Q

And if it wins, if the union wins?

A

If the union wins this plant will be moved

South?
20

Q

Yes.

A

This would be considered to be a threat.

Mr. Wallace.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court.
The petitioner in this case has raised a primary
contention of the problem of reconciling Section 8(a)(1) with
Section 8(c), 8(a)(1) being the section, one of the sections
that the Board found the petitioner to have violated.

These

are set forth on page 43 of our brief in the appendix and
perhaps that is a good starting point for assessing the
primary contention made here.
Under Section 8(a)(1) of the Act it is an unfair
labor practice for an employer to interfere with restrain
or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed
in Section 7, including the right to a free choice in deciding
whether they want to select a representative to represent them
in collective bargaining.
Under Section 8(c) of the Act, Congress has said
that the expressing of any views argument or opinion or the
dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic
or visual form shall not constitute or be evidence of unfair
labor practice under any of the provisions of this Act if such
21

1

expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or

2

of benefit»

3

promise

Now run together and in the light of their legis­

4

lative history we submit that Congress was saying two things,

5

it including both of these provisions in the Acts

6

it wishes to guarantee the employer’s right to express his

7

views and this is at all times under 8{c) —■ it is not

8

restricted to the period of election — and the other thing

9

is that Congress wanted to protect the employees who are

One, that

10

economically dependent upon the employer from being deprived

11

through threat of reprisal of their freedom of choice in the

12

exercise of their right to choose their bargaining repre­

13

sentatives, and to bargain collectively if they so desire.

14

This prohibition of threats of reprisal which exists

15

in the Act is an integral part of Congress1 regulation of the

16

employment relationship, regulation of the manner in which

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

the terms and conditions of employment will be established
under the Act,
Q

Do you suppose the language of the statute goes

no further than what the employer already had a right to do
under the First Amendment, or does it go further?
A

My view is that it goes further as would be

indicated in decisions of this court in other areas of
economic regulation where there is not a provision comparable
to 8(c) protecting freedom of expression in the relationship,
22

1

in the economic relationship»

2

Trade Commission against Texaco in this term where the Court

3

held that there was inherent coercion in the recommendation

4

by Texaco to its dealers of a particular brand of tires,

5

batteries and accessories certainly the Labor Board would not

6

go this far in the face of 8(c) as the Trade Commission did

7

with this court sustaining it in that case in a similar

8

economic context except for the differences in the statutory

9

provisions.
