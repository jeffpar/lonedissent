ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. GROSBY, ESQ.

No. 150, Frances

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
The appellant in this case was arrested in March
1966, and charged with violation of Section 17-379, causing the
arrest and imprisonment of someone who has fallen into vice
or leads a vicious life.
The appellant filed a demurrer on this on two grounds
one was that its tenns were vague and uncertain and meaning1

25

less, thereby depriving her of due process.

The second was

that the statute discriminates against certain females that is
unmarried demales between ages of 16 and 22 on the basis of
its support and thereby timing protection.
On the same day demurrer was filed the State com­
mittee filed a substitute for alleging two additional charges.
One was violation of Section 53-219 of the general statutes,
that statute entitled Vicious Carriage and Fornication.
Section 53-175 of the statutes which is the sordid
conduct statute, the demurrer was overruled* pleaded not guilty

r

t

of both charges and elected a trial by court, was found guilty

2

of 17-379, guilty of 52-219 and not guilty of sordid conduct»

3

4

Sentence was commitment to the Connecticut State
Farm for Women»
I think that the running of these sentences was

S

6

concurrent»

7

Q

3

1 looked at your Connecticut

statutes and I found some difficulty with them»
As I see them, as far as the lascivious carriage

9

,

How does that work?

10

charge, the maximum term she could get v?as two years in the

11

reformatory whereas under the manifest danger or whatever that

12

other statute is that she got a three-year sentence»

13

A

That is right, sir»

14

Q

How are they concurrent?

15

A

Except this way»

If at the time of sentencing

16

the law was that the sentence on the city8s carriage could also

17

be for three years to the reformatory»

18

the cases that we cited in our brief, two District Court cases

19

and two Connecticut Superior Court cases have held that by

20

having a three-yeair sentence on the lascivious carriage, that

21

is the discrimination against the female because boys can only

22

be convicted for two years under the applicable statute for

23

boys o

0

What is that?

This is particularly

I didn't know there was a

comparable crime for males»
3

1

A

Not with respect to 17-379? 17-379 deals only

2

with manifest danger and 17-360 says that a female over the

3

age of 16 who has been convicted of misdemeanor and lascivious

4

carriage of misdemeanor can go to the Connecticut State Farm

5

for three years»

j

17319 says a young boy who is convicted of misdemeanor

6
7

can go to the reformatory for two years.

8

subsequent —Q

9

Therefore, in

The cases in the court dealt with situations

10

where men and women or boys and girls could be convicted of

?1

the same offence?

12

A

Yes, sir.

13

Q

Not so here?

14

a man can he convicted to for lascivious carriage.
A

15
16

19

A man could be t onvicted of fornication or

breach of peace.
Q

17
18

Give me something comparable that

Do you think those raise the rationale of those

cases?
Do you think that comparison invokes the rationale

20

of those cases that cited the woman may not be imprisoned for

21

more than two year's?

22

A

Yes, sir, so District Courts held -—

23

Q

No, they didn't.

24
25

They had comparable crimes.

They were the same crimes between man and woman weren't they?
A

Yes, sir.

sentenced to two years in the reformatory while a young girl

3

convicted of the same statute could be sentenced for three.

These cases in our reply briefs said this is improper and that

it appears that the sentences were in three parts where this

7

new law was held.

8

'I

A young boy convicted of lascivious carriage could fee

9

x'H

the maximum sentence for boys as well as girls, so that

Q

Is it clear which sentence she is now serving?

A

Yes, sir, we take the position that two-year

10

sentence has expired and the maximum sentence on lascivious

11

carriage which is two years has expired and the whole thing

12

that is going on now is that the manifest danger and therefore

13

we take the position that if we reverse that conviction she

14

will be set free.

15

Q

I had the impression she was at liberty now.

16

A

She is on parole,

17

Q

What is the maximum age 'under this statute?

m

A

The lascivious carriage statute as applied by

19

recent sentence is two years.

20

until age 21.

21

three years is the maximum, so she is liable for the lascivious

22

carriage statute until June 1969 and the lascivious carriage

23

sentence has expired in 1968.

24
25

Q.

Manifestation statute says

We do have interpretations in the record that

If the female is 21 years old, what is the

maximum, sentence?

A

Commitment on manifest danger is until she is

2

21 with three years whichever occurs first.

lascivious carriage the statute is three years but the court

4

say two years.

and girls.

Q

A commitment on

Because there is discrimination between boys

A female at any age can be convicted of las­

civious carriage?

8

A

Yes, sir.

0

Q

But manifest danger is only between IS and 21

10

II

Yes, sir.

and unmarried?
A

Yes, sir.

I think the court anticipated the

12

jurisdictional question when you raised the four questions you

13

asked us to answer in connection with our jurisdiction state­

14

ment and to clarify this once again we take the position that

t.

IS

these sentences are separate sentences that she is serving

16

her sentence under lascivious carriage and manifest danger

17

that the sentences were once concurrent and her maximum

18

sentence under lascivious carriage has expired.

19

only under parole under conviction for manifest danger.

And she is

20

Our brief on the merits make three points.

21

The first on® was whether manifest danger under the

22

statute and we covered that because the appellant under the

23

Circuit Court decided it is not a penal statute.

24

remedial statute and, therefore, it was not necessary for them

25

to take up the constitutional questions.
6

It is a

We claim that, this is a statute that provides for
the deprivation of liberty and, therefore, the due process
provisions of the Constitution must apply whether Connecticut
chooses to call this remedial penal.
Our second point is that the terms, having been
applied for vicious life, render that manifest danger statute
void because they fail to warn the accused a clear state of
conduct.
We claim that this statute is so vague that un­
married female of common intelligence must necessarily guess at
its meaning and we claim that the trier of fact has no standard
on which to judge a case and no standard by which to charge a
jury,
Q

Have there been any Connecticut decisions con­

struing the statute?
A

No, sir, there have not,

I listened to the

argument yesterday of the construing by Illinois Supreme Court
of that statute but we have not.

There has not been any

adjudication and there is no way that any of our courts have
set for a definition of manifest danger of

falling into «ice

and vicious life.
Q

Can you think of anything that almost anyone

would agree ie vice or vicious?
A

I suppose that I could, your Honor.

Q

What if she performed just exactly that, that
7

1

act that you could think of was an example of vice or the

2

example of vicious life?

3

this case, the facts show that is the conduct in which she

4

engaged»

5

Do you think then that the statute would be vague?

6

A

No, we feel that this statute is so vague that

7

no recourse need be made of the facts, that this is uncon­

8

stitutionality in toto on its face rather than in application.

9

We feel that this
Q

10

Do you think vice or viciousness is that vague

11

that you really, no one could even imagine a situation that

12

would be covered by this provision against the vice or vicious

13

life?

14
'

What if it is a matter of fact in

A

i

1 may have some personal predilections of what

15

is vice or vagueness and I am sure the trial judge would, too,

16

but until there is a definita definition by statute or perhaps )

17

an instruction by court, I think it is clear on its face this

m

is the issue to be raised squarely by our demurrer and this is

19

wly we presented the facts.

20

The third point in our brief is that manifest danger

21

statute applies only to men, only to girls and not to women.

22

A young man cannot be convicted to the habits of felling into

23
24
25

- t

vice or vicious life.

He must b© convicted of a substantive

crime and the same of married women in order to be convicted.
A married woman must first be convicted of substantive
8

1

crime before she could be sent to the reformatory.

2

that female vices are no more dangerous than male vices.

3

we see and can find no substantial or natural difference to

4

render the subject which justify such delineation.

5

Q

How old is this statute?

6

A

The statute is 1917.

7

And

I think the legislative

history is set forth in the State's brief in the appendix.
Q

S

We submit

From the record that we have here does not

include the transcript of what went on at the trial.

10

that right?

11

A

That is right, sir.

12

Why is that?

13

A

We took the position, Mr. Justice, that

is so vague on its face that a recourse to the

19

Q

She pleaded not guilty to the two counts?

20

A

There is a transcript but it was not filed even

in the Appellate Division or this court?

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR» CARROLL;

20

.

21

22

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court.
There is really no quarrel about the facts as recited

23

by Mr» Grosby.

24

respect, correct two things in those facts»

25

The State does, however, want to, with due

And that is the age of the statute, 53-379, was
10

1

originally passed in 1905 In substantially its present form

2

and Mr. GrosbyJs reference to the State brief in terms of

3

legislative history really was in connection with 17-360 which

4

is the commitment vehicle statute r so that the statute really

5

goes back to 1905, the words manifest danger falling into the

6

habits of vice but that is when they first appear.
There is another dispute or I don't think it is a

7

8

real difficult dispute but disparagement of facts.

This girl

9

was 17 when she was convicted and as 1 said in our brief, her

10

birthday was April 15, 1949.

11

fusion here in the record and in the decision of our Appellate

12

Division.

13

14
15
16

17

There is a great deal of con­

I believe they say she was 18 but that is incorrect.
She was born in 1949 and convicted in June 1966.
Q

Why is that of any importance and does that

bear on whether or not these are concurrent sentences?
A

Wo, it does not do that, Mr. Justice, but it

18

may have a bearing in terms of the applicability of the three-

19

year maximum provision for the age 21.

20

In Section 17-379 which is the statute that is under

21

appeal here, 17-379, in which are contained the words manifest

22

danger of falling into habits of vice, it says until she is 21.

23

A Caucasian, unmarried female, between 16 and 21

24

should be committed there until she is 21.

25

which I think you can agree is the actual committing vehicle.
11

But Section 17-360

,
>

1

Q

Limited to the maximum,,

2

A

Limited to the maximum of three years but it

3

has certain limits there and It is our opinion in Appendix A,

4

we set forth the Attorney General5s opinion in which he says

5

none of the statutes are different, and 1 think there is no

6

quarrel about this.
If the girl becomes 21 first, then she has to be

7
8

released, whichever comas earlier.

1 set that forth in my

9

brief and opinion but it is buttressed by the Attorney General’s

10

opinion and I don’t think there is any quarrel about that.

1!

In terms of your question, her age would have an

12

affect on that.

In other words, if she is 17 as I claim she

13

was, before IS49, then her time would be up in three years,

14

no tifhen they reached 21 so she would be free from parole in

15

June 1969.

16

Q

In June 1969?

17

A

Yes.

18

Q

Under the falling into danger?

19

A

Under the falling into danger.

20

Q

And she is already free, do you agree with

21

counsel that. she is already free under the lascivious carriage?

22

A

No.

23

Q

You don81?

24

A

No.

25

That is our ma|n argument.

This convic­

tion and sentence stand on isidependanfc State grounds.

12

Namely,

1

the conviction under lascivious carriage charge under 53-2190

2

Mow that statute she received a concurrent sentence

3

and the sentencing provisions again are under 17-360.

4

same sentencing vehicle, the same sentencing maximum, namely

5

for three years, are applicable to this girl and this charge

6

under which site was convicted, lascivious carriage at the same

7

trial was not appealed.

8
9

There is no appeal from that statute.

The

There is no

And, in addition to Mr. Justice

10

White8s noting the fact that there is no comparable statute

1

for men, not only the sentences are different, maximum sen­

12

tences are different, but there is no statute comparable to

13

manifest the danger for falling into habits of vice for young

14

men.
Q

15

Wasn't the rationale of the edification that

16

said in spite of the three-year provision that a woman could

17

only be held for three years

18

A

It was.

1©

Q

And since men convicted for the same crime

20

could only be held two years it was illegal to hold the woman

21

three

22

A

That is correct.

23

Q

And your argument is that there was no com-

24
25

parable crime here for the men
A

That is correct, Mr. Justice.
13

My argument is

s

<

more than that? it is also that those decisions are not
binding here at all„
This statute 53-213 is not before the court at all.
That is why in the cases cited in the brief we claim that the
threshold of this whole case the court is met by a conviction
without infirmity on another statute with concurrent sentence
because there is nothing here before the court that says that
the limitation on .53-219 conviction is two years as far as
young girls between 16 and 21 are concerned.
There is nothing to that effect before the court.
When that girl was sentenced
Q

1 know.

But the claim is that under the

Connecticut law no matter what, the statute says the woman can
only be held two years.

Isnst this a direct appeal?

A

This is a direct appeal.

Q

Yes, and they are saying that under the appli­

cable Connecticut law as revealed in these cases,, this
sentence on lascivious carriage is not three years, it is only
two because the Connecticut courts have construed sentences
like this to be only two years because of the equal protection
law?
A

I take issue with that because of the fact that

the high court of Connecticut has not. said so and the fact is
that the only -0

which he has* that this is a denial of the equal protection»

Q

I am trying to find out what you mean by inde-

pendent State Ground»

That no appeal was ever taken from a

Connecticut Appellate Court from the conviction for lascivious
carriage»

And, therefore, I gather your point is that what­

ever may be the case as to two years, this petition is pre­
cluded by the failure of the appeal by the three years?
A

That is right.

There has been no ruling, administratively or other­
wise, or no decision of the Connecticut Supreme Court that in
a case like this with a minor female between 16 and 21 con­
victed of lascivious carriage that the maximum sentence should
be anything less than three years,

in clear.

16

1

A

That is a hard thing to answer there, Justice»

2

I think vice is more clear»

3

Federal case which did involve a criminal conviction but did

4

say about vice that nothing is more clear than promiscuous

5

and uninhibited sexual intercourse is vice»

6

But 1 may expound from that» a

That if anything is vice, that is it.

And you see

7

here unfortunately we don’t have the facts before the court

8

or of the record of the conducts of this young woman to measure

9

against the words of the statute because I think this is the

10

type of statute that could be applied in some cases in an

11

unconstitutional manner that is not unconstitutional void for

12

vagueness on its face but that the court should have the benefit

13

of the conduct to measure against the words of the statute and.

54

after all isn’t that only logical because the reasons for the

15

statute being void for vagueness and, therefore, denial of due j

56

process are to primarily that the act or didn't know what

17

conduct is called vice.

18

I say that the record in this case would reveal that

19

this actor or any actor would know that the conduct would come

20

within the purview of the word vice but not having that before

21

you is another reason the State maintains that the court

22

should not disturb

23
24
25

Q

Would it not have been proper in this situation !

to bring the record here?
A

It was

not made a part o£ the record.

5

6

8
9

mean the transcript, your Honor, of the evidence?
Q

Would it have not been proper for counsel to

put that in the Appendix, under the appellate procedure?
A

Not the xtfay the appeal was taken, no, because it

was just an appeal from the overruling of the demurrer.
Q

Then you don't question whether it should have

been here or not?
A

Yes, I do because under our practice in the case

that 1 cited in my brief called State versus Sul

is that you

m

cannot be overruled on a demurrer, the constitutionality of

11

the statute, and then proceed to a full trial and be convicted

12

and then appeal the overruling of the demurrer without any

13

evidence before the Appellate Court.

14

Th,afc is our law under the case of State versus Sul.

15

I should add as 1 did in the brief, however, that the court

16

said but anyhow we are going to look at the situation because

17

of the constitutional issues that were involved but they

18

clearly said under Connecticut law namely that this should not

19

be in the Connecticut Appellate Court in this form because the

20

demurrer having been overruled, then the trial, then the

21

conviction, defense counsel mad© the motion to dismiss, that on

22

the appeal the record of that trial should be before the court.

23

Q

The overruling on the demurrer or the conviction?

24

A

The overruling on the demurrer.

Q

And what you said is that the Connecticut practice

25

18

i

1

is that you appeal from the overruling of the demurrer but

2

there has been a subsequent trial after the overruling of the

3

demurrer, that the Appellate Court has to have the trial record

4

before it?

5

A

Yes, your Honor,

6

Q

What I am interested in, do you question whether

7

,

the appeal is properly before us in this posture?

8

A

Yes, I do,

9

Q

You argue that in your brief?

10

A

Yes, 1 don't know if I argued just in the terms

11

the Chief Justice means but I argue it in terms of this court

12

being unable to pass upon the statute without having before it

13

the facts that were brought out at the trial and with the

14

basis of her conviction under it.
1

15
16

So that is additional independent State grounds,

A

Yes, but I think

isn't it?

17
18

Q

Mr, Chief Justice's point is

that I haven't made a procedural argument on that, I have tried

19

to make a substantive argument of it in terms of whether the

20

court should consider it not having the record before it,
Q

21

22
23

Connecticut,

Yes, but you said there was an appeal in
Nevertheless, we can question the statute even

though it was not brought as your practice required, the trial !

24

record was brought on the appeal on the overruling of the

25

demurrer?
19

1

a

Yes»

2

Q

Why would we not be able also to do that?

3

A

X certainly would not deny you that prerogative.

4

I would say though and I think that is why I cast this more

5

in practical terms of applying a statute to a set of the facts

S

hht are nonexistent<>

7

case it was like playing Hamlet without Hamlet.

8

I think Justice Frankfurter said,in one

I think that is what we have here and I think there

9

are statutes that come under free speech restrictions that this

10

court can look at and has looked at and said these are patently

11

and on their face unconstitutionally void for vagueness but I

12

don't think this is that kind of statute.

13

It is talking about conduct which is not within the

U

constitutionally protected area and 1 think in that type of

15

case and in the cases I cited in my brief on this point that

16

the court should have the facts before it and if it didn't that!
■
is vagueness.

17

'18
19

Q

May 1 ask you another question to try to clarify

the underlying sentence situation in my mind.

If a woman age

'i

20

22 were arrested and convicted of the crime of lascivious

21

carriage under your statutes , what would be the1 sentence?

22

A

Six months maximum.

23

Q

What happened here is that this woman, being

24

under 21, 16 or 17, was convicted of that same crime under the

25

lascivious carriage.

And your position is that the effective
'20

1

sentence was three years because of the order committing her

2

to the State Farm for Women?

is that right?

3

A

Yes, sir»

4

Q

But so far as that conviction of the crime of

5

lascivious carriage is concerned, the sentence provided by

6

Section 53, whatever it is, is six months? is that right?

7

A

Yes, sir»

8

Q

And the three-year hypothesis depends solely

9

upon whether it is Section 17-360?

10

A

Yes, sir.

11

Q

And Section 17-360 makes no reference to the

12

crime of lascivious carriage but provides only if I understand

13

it, that the maximum commitment to the State Farm for Women

14

shall bs three; years.

15
16
17

Is that right?

Are you relying on the provision in 17-360 that says
!•

that the maximum commitment to the State Farm for Women shall
be three years;?

!
I am relying on 17-360 but a different part of

18

I

19

20

Please tell me what part of it.

21

Persons who may be committed to this institution.

22
23
24
25

persons who plead guilty to the commission of felony which
this is not.

Second, persons convicted of or who plead guilty

to the commission of misdemeanors, including prostitution,
intoxication, and disorderly conduct.
21

1

Q

But not lascivious carriage?

2

A

Wo, but I didn't take that to mean including

3

but not eliminating or not being exclusive,

4

Q

You mean the listing is not exclusive?

5

A

Yes, sir,

6

Q

All right, go ahead,

7

Read the

rest of that, will you please?
A

8
9

I am sorry.

The commission of misdemeanors constitutes

intoxication, drug use, and disorderly conduct, and third,

10

unmarried girls between the ages of 16 and 21 who fall into

11

the habits of vice which is the commitment provision for the

12

conviction under Section 17-379.

33

Q

14

Wow, tell me in summary if you don8fc mind just how,

35
16
17
18

1©

20
21

22
23
24
25

All right.

on what theory, keeping those statutory sections in mind, you
contend that appellant here is serving a three-year sentence
as a result of her conviction of the crime of lascivious
carriage„
A

Yes, your Honor,

If 1 may just take Section 17-379 which was the
actual conviction for manifest danger of felling into habit of
vice, 17-379 says;

Any unmarried female between ages of 16 and

21 who is in manifest danger of falling into habits of vice
or leading a vicious life or who has committed any crime upon
the complaint may be brought before the court and committed,
_

22

?

and then it goes on to say in effect that she may be committed

2

to the Connecticut State Farm for Women until she is 21«,

3

this section it doesn't mention the Connecticut State Farm for

4

Women but there is no question but that is what it is talking

5

about .

In

So she is convicted of manifest danger under 17-379?

6
7

under 53-219 she is convicted of lascivious carriage and either

8

the words in 17-379 or who has committed any crime- or the words

9

that I read before in. 17-360, the commission of misdemeanors,

10

including prostitution, et cetera, are applicable.
And she is committed under the maximum three-year

11
12

sentence in 17-360 for the crime of lascivious carriage as well

13

as for the manifest danger of Silling into vice charge under the

14

two states, 53-219 and 17-379.
17-360 says she has to stay there for a maximum of

15
16

three years including parole.

17
18
19

Q

17-360 says she has to stay there for three

h

Well, no, I should say she is exposed to being

years?

20

there for three years.

21

the maximum sentence.

22
23
24
25

That is the maximum.

Three years is

There is confusion in 17-379 which says

21 but as I said earlier I don9t think there is any question
as to this young lady, 17-360, three years maximum would be
applicable because it would foe longer to have her attain 21
and the lesser is applicable.

23

1

2

So under 17-360 she has the maximum exposure of three
years and both the charges under which she was convicted,

3

G

4

Where is the charge printed in the record?

5

This is an extraordinary chain puzzle, isn't it?
The

indictment, the information or whatever it is?

0

A

There is information in the substitute

informa­

7

tion in the record.

8

page, well it is right after page 4 and it is called substitute

9

information,

10

11

Q

14
'35

16

17

Do you read this

as making it a crime for a girl

to be in manifest danger of contracting habits of vice?

12
13

The information that is applicable is on

A

That is what falling into habits of vice, yes,

Q

How do you prove that by the environment or the

sir,

y
context or the fact that she is living in a city where there is j
l
a lot of temptation? How could it be proved? That is just a
f
possibility of what may happen to somebody in the future,

18

A

It is a danger, yes,

19

Q

You convict her of being in danger?

20

A

Yes, sir,

21

Q

We have, of course, the conduct,

22

A

If the conduct would be before the court it

23

would be clear that there was more than danger,

24

Q

25

says manifest danger.

Well, that is not what the statute says.
Has the court ever construed it as

•3d

It

1

being a crime to be in manifest danger, your Supreme Court?

2

A

No»

3

Q

Has it ever construed it at all?

4

A

No.

3

Q

Has there ever been any case in the State?

6

A

1 don't think there has ever been a case that is

7

at all applicable, no.

8

Q

9

Is this the only case that has ever been in the

State since it started in 1905?
A

10

Oh, no, there have been convictions but there is

11

no appellate decision on the statute as far as I know that has

12

any bearing on the problem before us.

13

Q

How do you know there have been convictions?

14

A

I know there have been convictions because I

15

have been prosecuting for a long time and I know that other

16

prosecutors in fact, in their brief, the appellant sets forth

17

the use of the statute by prosecutors in the State of

18

Connecticut»

19

20

Q

This is not the conduct.

This is for being in

A

I am saying, your Honor, that the cases I am

danger.

referring to are all for conduct, although I have to agree with
i

you the statute says danger of falling into vice.
Q

That is the charge here and we have to consider

it on the basis of what that is a good statute or not.
25

Do you

1

call it a crime to be in danger?

2

h

I won’t defend the statute at all, your Honor,

3

if I didn’t believe that to mean a. criminal.,

4

conduct has to be involved,
Q

5

6

The criminal,

It is a crime to be placed somewhere where you

are in danger or be tempted to do something wrong?
k

7

I suppose there is a degree of vice, your Honor,

8

I don’t think the statute should be or could be properly

9

applied, unless the danger had been realised,
Q

10

They don’t fix any punishment like penalty or

11

fine or imprisonment, do they?

12

like you would put a child, like a parent would put a child in

13

the back room.

14

isn’t in any danger there?

16

That is to take care of it to see that she

k

15

Well, 1 don't think we can avoid the penal

nature of this.
Q

17

They just put them in a jail

That is the idea.

It; is rehabilitation,

It seems to me like it is not a crime the way

18

they have handled that part to put her in jail just to take

19

care of her and take her out of danger.

20

be completely out of danger there.

Of course, she may not

21

h

Well she is out of there now anyhow,

22

Q

Why do we have to pass on it if she is out of

23

there?

*

24

h

Her point is that she is on parole and ---

25

Q

Do you agree that she is on parole then?
26

i

A

Yea, she is on parole.

Q

It is not moot,, of course.

A

1 don't claim it is moot,, no.

Q

But you did say she is on parole from a con­

current sentence that has in no way been attacked?
A

That is correct..

1 don't think that is tech­

nically mootness but we certainly raise that and raise that
very strongly.
Q

Let us see if I can get this correct.

First

is this Chinese pussis ©f extrapolating the six-months sentence
for lascivious carriage and three months commitment to the
State Farm for Women.
Three months , we regard that as sentence * and you gat
an exact identity with the length of the sentence under the
danger resulting from being a female statute.

And if that is

so, then we have th© problem of concurrent sentences because
of lascivious carriage conviction which is not before us.
Then if we can consider the res ipsa loquitur
criminal statute, danger of being a woman in New Haven,
Connecticut, then 1 suppose then we get into the questions that
Mr. Justice Black raised.
Is that a correct analysis of it?
A

That is a correct analysis but I don't think the

sentencing provisions are that mush of a Chinese pusssle.
Maybe 1 am going more by practice than by what is brought out.
27

1

I think if you read 379 and 360 and 53-219, there is

2

no question that she is properly sent there for three years

3

under 53-219 and these decisions mentioned by counsel I donet

4

believe affect this case»

5

If 3 may add a word on the vice, when we were talking

6

about vice, I think it is clear from the context of the

7

statute and other language in the statute that it is criminal

8

vice.

9

of vices that are used even more innocuously than that, of

I have a vice of smoking cigarettes.

There is all kinds

10

course, but the whole context of this is talking about, criminal

11

vice and the type of vice we think about when we think of a

12

vice squad,

13

Q

I suppose you have in Connecticut specific
t

14

criminal statutes and ordinances making it illegal, that sort

IS

of criminal conduct?

16

'A

That is correct,

17

Q

The sort of hard core conduct that everybody

18

seems to agree.' is covered by this is also covered by specific

19

criminal statutes, is it not?

20

A

I think most of the cases that have come up

21

under this would be covered by specific criminal conduct, yes,

22

sir, but I think it is brought up because of the fact that

23

this category of young person was regarded as being in need

24

of particular treatment.

25

There was drinking involved in the case, too.
28

This

J

type of drinking on her part may not have fit a specific
i■

criminal offense in Connecticut but she was at the time a

<.

16-year old girl and she was drinking while this other; business
was going on, that particular conduct which was in the record
and in the testimony»
Q

What is the upper limit on age for juvenile

court proceeding?
A

i
i

Sixteen, your Honor»

Between 16 and 18 the adult court can r€:fer them if
they think they are amenable to juvenile court jurisdiction.
Q

!

So would the juvenile court have been able to

i

exercise jurisdiction over this young woman?

\
!'

A

Not unless she was referred by the court that

j
(
i

heard this case prior to the court hearing.
i

Q

So that court could have referred her and then

she could have been taken care of under the juvenile court
, ' V

; statutes until she was 21?
A

r.

Yes, that court could have but the court had

background of reasons why it didn’t.
Q

Do you know whether there had been any con­

victions for a. charge of danger of becoming a cigarette smoker?
A

No, your Honor.

Q

You mentioned that as a vice.

A

Yes, I mentioned that.

Q

I presume that a lot of people will agree with

1

you that that is a form of vice from which a person should be
protected?
A

Well*, a person presently is not protected from

i

that particular vice by legislation and this particular kind

3

of vice that v;e are talking about here we maintain does protect

society and a young lady such as this one by criminal sanctions

What I am getting at is, why couldn't cigarette

That could come under a statute?
A statute could be passed.
I. am not talking about passed.

I am talking

about under this statute.
A

Under this statute, no, because I think the

2!

other words of the statute make it clear that this is criminal

22

vice and habits.

23

Q

The other words of the statute say that couldn't

24

be considered a vice?

25

A

When read in context it says that to me and I
30

1

point that out.

2

Q

I don't see why it couldn’t.

3

A

Here is what I said in that respect.

4

The word vice must be read in the context of the

5

general statutory schema and juxtaposition to the phrase, "or

6

committed any crime" which is in the statute.
Q

7

That is a separate part.

Who has committed

any crime.

m
11

For the first time, of course, it is being sub-

smoking.
A

It is a matter of interpretation.

I claim the

12

only fair interpretation of the statute is that it is criminal

13

vice that it is talking about.

14

Q

But the word vice is not limited to criminal?

15

It certainly isn’t and it applies to much more

innocuous things than cigarette smoking.

That could be a vice.

Q

It would be bad to be charged with being tempted

that way, wouldn’t it?
A

It certainly would.

Q

As a matter of fact, you realize, don’t you,

that vice doesn’t have any definite meaning.
any boundaries.
A

It doesn't have

It depends on what people think.
I made clear that it has very broad meaning.
31

1

Q

To you., yes o'

2

A

To everybody.

But I would also like to make

3

clear that I think the only fair construction of this statute

4

is that it is a criminal vice.
Q

5

Why couldn't they write one that limited it to

©

that?

7

of falling into vice when it covers a thousand different things

8

to a thousand different people?

9

Why should they be trying people for vices and danger

A

Well, if the court had before it the conduct of

1©

tie person, it could judge, couldn’t it, whether that is

11

type of vice that could constitutionally be prescribed.

12
13

14

Q

Well, I don’t know.

the

I should think that here

the sky is the limit under this statute.
A

I think you start with the assumption, your

15

Honor, that the statute should be construed so that it reason­

1©

ably and possibly its constitutionality should be upheld and

17

I don’t think that is very difficult.

18

Q

But should we do that here?

19

A

Well, I don't think you should get to that,

20

your Honor.

21

Q

1 don’t think you should get to that.
We would have to get to that.

They are

22

challenging it on the grounds of it being unconstitutional,

23

vague and uncertain.

24
25

But I think because this conviction stands on

independent State ground and because yon don't —

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. GROSBY:

Mr. Chief Justice, we do have a pro­

7

8

We say that the Sul case was a

Mr. Justice Black indicated whether there were any

9

decisions under this or any cases under this statute and in

10

our appendix we indicate that —- in the appendix on page 21

11

we indicate there were 560 cases since 1961.

12

Q

How many?

13

A

Five, hundred sixty.

One hundred twenty “eight

14

of which were committed to the Connecticut State Farm? 356

15

guilty findings, 179 nol~pros, 54 not guilties and 75 to

16

juvenile court, and some were held over to Superior Court.

17

Q

In the Sul case, I notice that the opinion of

18

your Appellate Division sets out, and I am looking at pages 14

19

and 15 of the Brown appendix, sets out the rules of the Sul

20

case in some length and says on page 15, the rules stated in

21

the Sul case with particular precision and particularity were

22
23
24
25

ignored by appellant in the case before us.
And then also on to say but we do not rest our
decision on that ground alone, which would imply to me that the
decision rested alternatively on that ground and that would be

an adequate State ground, would it not?

opinion was in error.

not it was in error, isn’t it?

Q

Before you get to that subject, may I ask you

what is the characteristic of this institution, this young
woman went to, is it a farm for women?

Is that, a juvenile

camp or is that for woman of all ages?
A

It is for women of all ages.

Q

And for all kinds of crimes?

A

And with complete desegregation.

In other words

Yes, sir.

That is true, sir,

19

Q

But here is it customary or unusual for the

20

adult court to refer cases like this from the age of 18 or

21

whatever it is to the juvenile court?

22

A

I think we show in our appendix that only 47

of the 560 were referred to the juvenile court in the period

Connecticut versus Walker, 4 Connecticut

Superior 659, and 4 Connecticut Superior 436 and Vena versus
Walker 17 Connecticut 365, from attacking the lascivious
danger statute.
This is the independent State grounds problem and
we felt that first time we could have done this was when your
decision was announced in Patton versus Roe and Patton versus
Roe does not appear to be a concurrent sentence, yet it might
be that the Payton versus Roe doctrine might supersede some
value.
The cases suggested is — is recounted in Mr.
Carroll8s brief on page 6; that is, the Hirabayashi and the
Pinkerton matters for several reasons assuming for the moment
which we don’t concede that the lascivious dangerous situation
is not still three years but we claim it is two, assuming that
it is three, the effect is a reason we feel there is a com­
pelling reason to consider the appeal for habeas corpus on one
concurrent sentence.
This might have to do with period of probation,
period of parole.

It might have to do with getting a job.

Even if this girl had to serve three years under lascivious
carriage, if she was convicted of manifest danger of falling
into vice, this could have some effect on here future job
holding ability and effort to get a job.

I think perhaps your Patsone versus Pennsylvania

case is one that may reopen this whdle situation on independent

State ground.

Q

You mean on concurrent sentence?

5

A

Yes, sir.

6

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

7

Q

May I ask.

Very well.

Is this conviction on lascivious

8

carriage something v/e can't touch because of your failure to

9

appeal the conviction?

10

A

11

Of course, the issue has not been briefed here

and has not been raised.
Q

12

The issue is that since in any event she has

13

three years on the conviction for lascivious carriage there is

14

no occasion on deciding the constitutional question raised by

15

the opinion of the court.
A

16

17

That is certainly before us.

No, but what we do ask you to decide,

Mr. Justice, is that the Federal Court decision and two State

18

Court decisions that said the maximum sentence on lascivious

19

carriage was two years is proper and therefore there is

20

only -—

21

Q

Well, I gather it is a question if they did

22

appeal from lascivious carriage but even if they had, even if

23

they had, you couldn't appeal from the three-year sentence

24

from conviction for lascivious carriage?

23

A

No, we couldn't appeal from lascivious carriage
39

1

as long as the doctrine of those Connecticut cases affects.

2

We feel the first time we could have done anything about it

3

was when Patton versus Roe was announced.

Then we could

Are ycm suggesting that the doctrine we have

6

followed on cases where

doctrines we have followed in other

cases where there are convictions for two counts and one of

8

them was concedingly is a valid conviction, ordinarily we don’t

reach any constitutional questions as to the other conviction,

are you suggesting that Patton

Yes, sir.

It may not be necessary for you to

decide that.
Q

14

If you find what the validity of lascivious

15

carriage sentence is a maximum of two years it may not need be

Q

Even though you did not appeal on the con­

19

A

Yes, sir.

20

Q

Are you saying that is a question on your

17

18

viction?

21

theory that is necessarily before us even though we don’t have

22

the conviction under lascivious carriage in order to get to

23

the other question, the question of in danger of falling into

vice question, that we have to arrive at some conclusion with

2

A

It is the State that really brings in the fact

of the conviction into this case, Mr. Justice.

already been convicted.

The States

And brings before the court the fact that

7

subsequent to the demurrer there have been convictions for two

offenses here?

8

A

Yes, sir.

10

Q

And consequently the offense of the conviction

11

must be before us or there would not be any question of

12

concurrent sentences here?

IS

A

Yes, sir.

14

We could have brought habeas corpus on the lascivious

13

carriage conviction after Patton versus Roe came down but you

had already noted probable jurisdiction,

We thought this

would be a lesson in futility.
