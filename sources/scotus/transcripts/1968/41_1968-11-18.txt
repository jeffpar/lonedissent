ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court.
This case is here on a writ

\\

of certiorari to the

12

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

u

relation with Section 10-b of the Securities Exchange Act of

It involves the construction

and 34 of the Government's brief in this case.

attention to the provision in Section 10-b, which makes it

16

unlawful for any person to use or employ in connection with

2C

the purchase or sale of any security registered on a National

21

Security Exchange or any security not so registered.

22

result of those two phrases is simply to apply to any security,

23

any fraudulent device as defined by the rules of the Securities

24

and Exchange Commission, and the relevant rule 10-b-5 is set

2S

out at the bottom of page 34 and on page 35.

1

The text of the McCarran-Ferguson Act Is on page 33

2

of our brief, and the relevant portion there, although it is

3

all relevant, but the part that comes closest is Section 2~b,

4

"No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair

5

or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of

6

regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee

7

or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically relates

8

to the business of insurance»"
And I would suggest that the key words in that pro­

9
10

vision of the McCarran-Ferguson Act are "the business of

11

insurance."
The present case began in March, 1965, when the

12

13

Securities and Exchange Commission filed its petition in the

14

District

15

enjoin the respondent here, National Securities, Inc., and its

16

subsidiary and certain officers and employees, from violating

17

Section 10-b, and rule lG-b-5, on the ground of asserted fraud

18

in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.

Court for Arizona.

It sought to have that court

In due course, the defendants filed a motion for

19
20

judgment on the pleadings, or, in the alternative, for summary

21

judgment.

22

granted by the District Court, and this was affirmed by the

23

Court of Appeals.

24
25

The motion for judgment on the pleadings was

As the Court of Appeals stated in its opinion, "In
this situation, the allegations in the amended complaint must
3

be presumed to be true„"
And these allegations may be summarized this way.
It is alleged that the respondent, National Securities
Inc., is a holding company, which owned two-thirds of the
slightly more than a million shares outstanding of National
Life, which was an Arizona Insurance Company.
Producers Life Insurance Company was another Arizona
company.

It had some 881,000 outstanding shares held by

approximately 14,000 stockholders in many States.
In other words, it was quite widely distributed.
The allegation is that the defendants formed an
illegal scheme, contrary to Section 10-b, under which National
Securities would acquire control of Producers Life, National
Life, and Producers Life would be consolidated, and the con­
solidated company would pay a large part of National Securities'
cost of acquiring control of Producers Life.
In carrying out this scheme, National Securities
purchased the stock in Producers which was held by four of
the Producers' directors, and agreed to pay them a very large
sum for their agreement not to compete with Producers Life or
any successor company.
And National Securities also purchased from Producers
Life more than 50,000 shares of its treasury stock, and assumed
some §600,000 of liabilities of Producers Life, arising out of
previous agreements which had been made with other persons

4

1
2

not to compete with itIt was further alleged that National Securites did

3

not disclose to Producer's Life or its stockholders that it

4

intended to impose both of these liabilities with respect to

5

agreements not to compete upon the corporation which would

G

result from the planned consolidation of Producers Life and

7

National Life.

8
9

After obtaining control of Producers Life, according
to the allegations again. National Securities caused the latter

10

to mail to its stockholders materials soliciting them to

11

approve the proposed consolidation with National Life„

12

it was then alleged that this material was false and misleading

1.3

on four grounds:

14
15
16

A.

And

That it did not disclose the liability on the

agreements not to compete„
B.

That, it predicted substantial consolidated

17

earnings, without disclosing that Producers Life and National

18

Life had each had losses in the prior year.

19

C.

It set forth on the pro forma balance sheet for

20

the consolidated company an asset shown as treasury stock in

21

22

the amount more than a Eiillion dollars that was alleged to be
that
illusory, and finally, that it did not disclose/in its report

23

to the Arizona Insurance Commission, and National Life had

24

written down the value of its investment in Producers Life by

25

more than a million dollars.
5

j

1

The court allowed the defendants to submit the

2

proposal to the Arizona Insurance Commission, and to the

3

stockholders, both approved the plan and it was carried out.

4

It was then that the Securities and Exchange Commission filed

5

the amended complaint, which is now before the court, seeking

6

such relief as might be appropriate under the circumstances.

7

In its answer to the amended complaint, and in its

8

motion for judgment on the pleadings, the defendant contended

9

that the District Court has no jurisdiction because the matters

10

complained of are entirely within State jurisdiction, as

11

provided in the McGarran Act, thus raising the issue which is

12

here«

13

The District Court accepted this contention as one

14

of its grounds of decision, and the Court of Appeals affirmed

15

the District Court's judgment on this ground alone.

16

The opinion of the Court of Appeals is in rather

17

sweeping terms.

18

argument appears on pages 156 and 157 of the appendix near the

19

bottom of page 156, "We are left, then, with a general

20

intention to set the insurance business outside the scope of

21

all existing and future legislation regulating Interstate

22

Commerce without any more direct evidence that Congress had

23

in mind the Securities Exchange Act.

24

The relevant portions for this part of my

"However, Congress was apparently seeking to define
I

25

an exemption for insurance," and then the word is
6

i

"conterminous", but 1 suppose we usually say "co-terminous"

2

"with its power to regulate Interstate Commerce»"

3

The court is there saying that with respect to

4

insurance insofar as Congress would have power to regulate any

5

aspect, of it under its commerce power, the effect of the

6

McCarran Act. is to say that that power is not being exercised, j

i
7

Over on page 157, just above the middle, the court

8

said, "An equally vital purpose of the McCarran Act was to

9

preserve intact from any Federal intrusion based on the

10

commerce clause existing and future State regulations of the

11

insurance industry."

12

Thus, the sole issue here is whether this construc­

13

tion of the McCarran-Ferguson Act and determination of its

14

effect are correct, or whether the facts alleged are suffi-

15

cient to state a cause of action under Section 10-b of the

16

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, despite the provisions of the

17

McCarran-Ferguson Act, which was passed in 1946,,

18

I will now turn to the legal questions involved in

19

this case.

20

stand on, but I think the footing is firm.

21

It may be that I have a somewhat narrow ledge to

When Section 10-b was enacted in 1934, there was no

2.2

doubt that it applied to fraud and the purchase and sale of

23

all securities.

24

"any security," including those in insurance companies.

25

was true despite the fact that it was the common understanding

You will recall the phrase in the statute is

7

This

j

1

at that time that the Federal Government had no power to

2

regulate "the business of insurance."

3

A clear distinction was evident between the business

4

of insurance on the one hand and securities of a company which

5

is engaged in conducting the insurance business.

6

In 1944, the Southeastern Underwriters case was

7

decided, followed in 1946 by the enactment of the McCarran-

8

Ferguson Act.

9

The Southeastern Underwriters case undoubtedly

10

involved the conduct of the business of insurance, the way in

1!

which insurance companies operate together in fixing their

12

rates, and had nothing to do with transactions in securities

13

of an insurance company.

14

The distinction was explicitly made in the McCarran-

15

Ferguson Act itself, where it said that no act of Congress

16

should supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose

17

of regulating the business of insurance.

18

This was emphasised in the report of the House

19

Committee set forth on page 24 of our brief, where the

20

committee said, "It is not the intention of Congress in the

21

enactment of this legislation to clothe the States with any

22

power to regulate or tax the business of insuracne beyond that

23

which they had been held to possess prior to the decision of

24

the United States Supreme Court in the Southeastern Under-

25

writers Association case."

j
8

!

In short the function of the McCarran-Ferguson Act

2

was to restore the status quo, to put things back where they

3

were before the Southeastern Underwriters case was decided,

4

except that it was made explicit that the Sherman Act, the

5

Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act should apply

6

to the business of .insurance to the extent that such business

7

is not regulated by State law.

8

•

It was only with respect to these three statutes that

9

there is any indication that Federal law should apply only if

0

there was an applicable provision in State lav?.

1?

Throughout their history, both before and after the

12

enactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the provisions of the

13

Securities law, relating to securities, and the securities laws

14

don't relate to the business of insurance — the provisions of

15

the securities laws relating to securities have been regarded

16

as applicable to securities in insurance companies.

17
18
19

We have listed many of these instances in the
footnotes on pages 16 and 17 of o\ir brief.
Thus, issues of insurance companies' securities had

20

been registered under Section 6 of the Securities Act of 1933,

21

securities of insurance companies listed on National Exchanges

22

have been registered with the Commission under Section 12 of

23

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, persons who buy and sell

24

insurance company securities have been registered under

25

Sections 15-b of the Securities Exchange Act, investment
9

?

companies with portfolios consisting of insurance company

2

securites have been registered under Section 8 of the Invest-

3

menfc Company Act, and persons selling insurance company

4

securities in a fraudulent manner have been enjoined and con­

5

victed in a considerable number of cases.

6

|

The decision of the court below, which fails to

7

recognize the distinction between the business of insurance,

Q

to which the McCarran-Ferguson Act applies, and dealings in

9

securities which happen to be stocks in insurance companies,

10

would sweep all this away,, and broadly exempt all dealings

11

in insurance securities from application of the Federal laws.

12

This is the effect of the decision below, where the

I

'

13

court said, "Congress was apparently seeking to define an

14

exemption for insurance conterminous with its power to regu-

15

late interstate commerce."

16

’

If Congress was intending to do that, obviously it

17

swept away all apolication of the securities laws to dealings

IS

in insurance securities.

19

Q

Mr. Solicitor General, one of my difficulties

20

in reading the briefs in advance of argument of this case

21

which continues now, is that you and your adversary don't

22

really seem to agree as to what this case is about.

23

Is that fair to say?

24

A

25

Well, I think there is something about that.

Mr. Frank raises a lot of other questions which present some
10

}

|

difficulties which were not decided by the -2

Q

I am not referring to the purchase and sale

3

difficulties.

I am talking,, really, about the broad question

4

to which you are now addressing yourself, and you are quoting

S

to us some very broad language of the United States Circuit

6

Court of Appeals, but the decision was on the part of the

7

District Court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, simply

8

that the McCarran Act foreclosed the undoing of a merger that

9

had been approved by the Arizona Commission.

10

That is the holding in this case, isn't it?

11

A

Not exactly, Mr. Justice Stewart.

We didn't ask

12

for the undoing of the merger in the

exclusively, as our

13

only relief, in the amended complaint.

We asked for such

14

relief as would be appropriate under the circumstances, and it

15

may well be that the merger should be left merged, but that

16

individuals who have profited by the transaction should be

17

required in some way to account, either by disgorging to the

18

merged company, or by making payments to the shareholders who

19

did not participate from it.

20

All the questions of relief are left undecided, both

21

by the District Court and the Court of Appeals, because they

22

didn't get to them, having held that the McCarran-Ferguson Act

23

eliminated the whole matter.

24
25

Q

Well, I didn't under the District Court or the

Court of Appeals really to have held that the 1933 Act or the

11

1

1934 Act was completely inapplicable, or completely inappli­

2

cable to the dealings in securities of insurance companies.

3

Well, Mr. Justice, I can't read that language on

4

page 157 of the Court of Appeals in any other way, "An

5

equally vital purpose of the McCarran Act was to preserve

6

intact from any Federal intrusion based on the Commerce clause

7

existing in future State regulation of the insurance industry."

8
9
10

|

A

And that would apply to any fraudulent sale of
insurance stocks.
Now, it is true that this case does involve a merger

11

of an insurance company, and Mr. Frank argues that approving

12

a merger is in some way analogous to the question of chart­

13

ering an insurance company»

14

I find it difficult, even with that, to find any­

15

thing in the McCarran-Ferguson Act which says that when this

16

is done in a fraudulent way that the provisions of the Securiti ss

17

and Exchange Act ane superseded, are written off, are in

i 18
19

effect repealed.
I pointed out that the practice has been consistently

20

to the contrary, both before the McCarran-Ferguson Act was

21

passed, and I think what is very relevant, before the South­

22

eastern Underwriters case was decided.

23
24
125

It was then regarded as the appropriate construction,
of the Securities Act that they were applicable to transactions
for purchases and sales, in the language of the statute, with
12

1

respect to insurance companies as to any other securities„ and

2

we think that the effect of the decision of the Ninth Circuit

3

is to make the Securities statutes inapplicable to trans­

4

actions, to dealings, to actions, with respect to securities

5

in insurance companies, and it is our contention that that is

6

not the proper construction of the McCarran-Ferguson Act,

7

which relates to the business of insurance, to the things

8

done by insurance companies with respect to their policy

9

holders, but not to transactions done by other persons with

10

II

respect to securities in insurance companies.
There obviously are other Federal statutes of

12

general application which were applicable to insurance before

13

the McCarran-Ferguson Act was passed, and which continued to

14

be applicable toinsurance thereafter.

£0

cluding those making it a crime to use the mails for the

21

purposes of fraud, and I would point out that Section 10-b

21

is based on the postal laws as well as on Interstate Commerce,

23

and that the mails were so used, and that there are a sizeable

24

number of prosecutions, before and after the McCarran-

25

Ferguson Act, for using the mails to defraud with respect to

2

These matters are not referred to in the McCarran-

3

Ferguson Act, but it cannot be supposed that Congress con-

4

texnplated any change in the law with respect to them.
As I have said, we cire dealing here with a statute

5

6

which is based in part on the postal power.

7

reason to think that Congress in passing the McCarran-Ferguson

8

Act intended to allow an insurance company to use the mails fco

9

defraud stockholders.

10

Q

There is no

Mr. Solicitor General, I take it then you would

11

say this is because this is not a matter of regulating in­

12

surance, but of regulating stock transactions, that if there

13

are Federal regulations as to what should be in a proxy

14

statement in connection with the merger conflict between the

15

Federal regulation and the State regulation, and the State

regulation approves the proxy statement and the Federal

the fraud was proved and found by the court.

24

Yes, Mr„ Justice.

25

Q

What if there had been no Southeastern case,
14

none at all»

Is it. your belief, that under the law as it

then existed, that Congress could have passed a bill regu­
lating this very thing under the Commerce clause?
A

Yes, Mr, Justice, It is our view that that, is

just what Congress did do in 1933 and 1934, that it passed a
law regulating transactions of purchase and sale of any
security, and that that included securities in insurance
companies, and was so construed by the Commission, and in a
very few cases by the courts, between 1933-34, and 1944, when
the Southeastern Underwriters case was decided.
Q

I asked you that question because I had been

under the impression, having summed up evidence in the South­
eastern Underwriters case, that it was the purpose of Congress
to do away entirely with this effect, was relying on the
Commerce clause was concerned in the Insurance Business Act.
I am sure it is the Insurance Business Act.
Would you not have, if that were the case, would you
not have to show that even without that, if that case had
never been decided, you had not changed the rule, that Congress
could have and would have passed this Act?
A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

That is exactly the argument

we do make, that Congress had this power and exercised it
before 1944, and that for that reason the enactment of the
MeCarran-Fergxason Act, which was intended to restore the
status quo, did not and was not intended to take away the
15

X

effect of the statutes which Congress had previously passed

2

with respect to securities *

3

4
5

Q

Have, there been any cases before the South­

eastern that were so held?
A

3

No cases in this court, certainly.

There was

6

a modestly, considerable amount of practical experience in

7

the Securities Exchange Commission, including registration

8

of securities and things of that sort.

e

Q

It had not be challenged on that ground?

io

A

Never has been challenged on that ground that

ii
12

13
14

I am aware of.
Q

But, Mr. Solicitor General, I would like to

direct your attention again to this line of thought.
As I understand your adversary, he says that the

15

merger, the merger itself of these companies was approved by

16

the Insurance Commissions.

17

Now, arguably, I suppose, you could say that the

18

merger is certainly an insurance company.

19

about the merger of two insurance companies here.

20

comes the SEC and says that this aspect of that merger is

21

subject to Federal law, namely, the terms of the offer of

22

exchange, the solicitation of the stockholders, and says that

23

therefore it is in conflict with the McCarran Act, because

24

this is something, the merger, that is insurance business, it

25

is a merger of two insurance companies.
16

We are talking
Then along

1

I don't profess to state —■-

2

A

Mr. Justice, I think you have stated the issue

3

very clearly, and very precisely.

4.

overlap here.

5

with the sweeping nature of the opinion of the Court of

8

Appeals, which says that the McCarran-Ferguson Act wiped out

7

completely all aspects of the securities regulation with

8

respect to insurance.

There is, of course,

some

I think a considerable part of our concern

9

When you come to the question of a merger, I think

10

it is a nice question as to what is meant by the business of

i1

insurance, and I think an argument can be made, which is the

12

one we stand on, that the business of insurance relates to the

13

internal operations of insurance, and not to dealings in

14

securities which Congress has so clearly taken over for

15

Federal authority.

16

Q

Let me see if I understand you, because I do

17

believe this is where the argument of the two parties comes

18

in collision.

19

What you are saying is that perhaps a merger of two

20

insurance companies is the business of insurance in some

21

respects, but to the extent that it involves the solicitation

22

of stockholders' consent, that that aspect of it is not the

23

business of insurance?

24
25

A

The dealing with the security holders, we would

contend is not "the business of insurance," as was meant by
17

1

Congress when it used those words in the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

2

There is one decision of this court which is pretty-

3

close in many ways, which is the United Benefit Life Insurance

4

Company case decided only a short while ago.
There, the company was undoubtedly an insurance

5

8

company, and the decision of the court that it could not sell

7

variable annuity policies without registering them with the

8

SEC is directly that the securities of an insurance company

9

are subject to the securities law, and are not taken out of the

10

provisions of the securities laws by the McCarran-Ferguson

11

Act»
i

12

In that case the --

13

Q

The holding in that case was that that company

14

was engaged in selling securities, not insurance policies.

15

Suppose that the insurance company went into the telephone

16

business, they had to pay the tax on telephones?

17

A

That would be applicable to the variable annuity!
li

18

life insurance company, which sold nothing but variable

19

annuities, but this — but the United Benefit Life Insurance

20

Company was undoubtedly an insurance company.

21

quantities of what everybody would agree was insurance.

22

also sought to sell variable annuities, and this court held

23

that it couldn't do it without registering them with the SEC,

24

and that, it seems to me, is inevitably a direct decision that

25

the securities of an insurance company are subject to the
18

It sold large
It

1

registration, provisions of the securities laws, despite the

2

fact that Congress has passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, or

3

to put it another way, that dealings in the securities of an

4

insurance company are not "the business of insurance," within

5

the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

6

There are other cases which are close, but I think

7

that the United Benefit case comes very close to supporting
