No. 791, Ronald L. Crane,

Mr. Chief Justice ind may it please

the Court.
This case involves only a single question, but one of

It

great importance in the administration of th » Federal Safety

12

Appliance Act.

The question is whether in a suit ander that Act
brought by a nonrailroad employee, the railroad can assert the
defense of contributory negligence.
Everyone concedes that the petitioner in this case is
covered by the Act.

Everyone concedes that If this same suit

were brought by a railroad employes, contrib itory negligence
could not be asserted as a defense even fchouyh all the facts '—■*
were precisely the same and the violation of the Act was
\

precisely the same as in the case of the non railroad employee.
Here petitioner Ronald Crane was employed as a mealhouse helper by Cargill, inc.

His job was t> spot, weigh and

help load railroad cars which were delivered empty by the
respondent railroad to Cargill and after loaiing were picked

25
2

1

up again by the respondent railroad for delivery in Interstate

2

Commerce .

3

The trial court properly instructed the jury, and

4

this court can assume that "For the purpose of this case the

5

railway cars on which plaintiff was working were being used by

6

the defendant as part of its system."

Now on the night of the accident, 1963, petitioner
Crane and his co-worker, Harris, were handlinc a string of six
railroad cars.

Harris detached or uncoupled the two most

northerly cars in the string and moved them along the tracks
for weighing by means of an electric winch anc cable.
When these cars were returned to the string, impact
was made with the remaining four cars with sufficient

force

to move those cars some five feet, even though the brake was on.
Now at that point the two cars clearly should have
recoupled automatically to the string of four cars.

This

court undoubtedly knows from prior cases the Federal Safety
Appliance Act as interpreted by this Court prcvides that
railroad cars must be equipped with couplers v>hich couple
automatically by impact and when set in the proper position,
of course, and which will thereafte remain coupled until set
free by some purposeful act of control.
Now, in this case the knuckles were in proper
position, the cars collided with sufficient impact.

Both Crane

and Harris, who looked at the mechanism thought and testified
25

3

1

that the knuckles were closed and that the couplers appeared

2

to be locked.

But in fact they were not locked.

3

Hours later, Harris began to move the entire string

4

of cars forward by attaching the winch to the second car with

5

Crane on the third car ready to put the brakes on, and the

6

first cars, two cars, began to move out on their own, run-away

7

cars, uncoupled to the rest of the string.
Crane thought that these run-away cars were going to

0
9
10
11

12
13

14

ram into an empty car which he thought he had seen down the
track and in which he thought men were workinc and consequently
he quickly put the brake on the third car, he jumped down and
he ran along the tracks and he climbed up a ladder on the back
of the second car and began to turn the brake to stop these
two run-away cars and he fell to the tracks to a cement pavement
The bones in his feet were jammed up into his legs

15
16

and he was permanently injured.
Now, before proceeding further, I want to say just a

17
13
19

20
21

22
23

word about the statement of facts given by the. respondent.

We

t

have answered each of these statements with citations to the
record in our reply brief, but the most direct answer to it
is that precisely the same argument on the facts was made twice
below to the trial court in an effort to keep this case from
going to the jury.
Once at the conclusion of our evidence, once at the

24

conclusion of all the evidence, twice the trial judge rejected
25

4

1

that version of facts, twice the trial judge said, "This case

2

can go to the jury."

3

Consequently, we submit that the respondent railroad

4

is not free again here to reargue these facts which properly

5

were for the jury and which went to the jury.

6

Crane brought his case in an Iowa State Court,

7

alleging violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act in that

8

the railroad had provided cars with defectiva couplers.

From the outset of this case Crane argued that
contributory negligence was not a defense, was not a defense
where there was a violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act,
that liability was absolute once a violation was shown to be
approximate cause of his injury.
The railroad argued otherwise and the trial judge
adopted the railroad's argument and allowed the defense of
contributory negligence to go to the jury anI as a matter of
fact put the burden on Crane to prove, absence of contributory
negligence, rather than on the railroad to prove the presence
of contributory negligence.

Q

I suppose that is the usual rule of Iowa law?

A

No, sir.

As a matter of fact that is the

minority rule.

Of Iowa lav;.

A

Oh, 1 am sorry.

I misunderstood you.

rule under Iowa law, yes, sir.
5

It is a

Now the jury decided for the raiircad and denied all

1

2l.

recovery to Crane.

The Iowa Supreme Court affirmed with two

3i

justices dissenting, although it recognised that recent

4.

opinions of this court put the matter in some doubt.
It did not feel free to depart from what it considered

5>

S

older case law indicating that all common lav defenses except

7

assumption of risk are applicable to nonrailioad employees.

8

That now is the issue before the court.
Now the problem arises because the Federal Safety

9
10

Appliance Act was passed in 1893 without any specific reference

11

to a remedy other than a suit for penalties ty the United

12

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22

24
25

States.
Consequently, suits for violation of this Act were
brought in State courts and the earliest case on contributory
negligence from this court, the Schlemmer case, held that in
t he absence of legislation at the time of the injury in that
case, taking away the defense, the common lav controlled.
We show in our brief how we think Schlemmer was misinterpreted in later decisions but in any event it certainly
is true that between 1911 and 1935 this court did state in
dicta in several opinions that State law controlled as to the
defense of contributory negligence.
Q

That certainly is true.

Excuse me, may I interrupt just for a moment.

I think I know the answer to this tut was it your
submission that, I know it was, that contribitory negligence
6

1

should not provide an absolute defense to tha defendant in

2

this case, was it your submission that the rale of comparative

3

negligence should apply or that no matter hotf great the

4

plaintiff negligence may be there was still absolute liability

5

on the part of the defendant?

6

It was the latter wasn't it?

7

A

Yes, dimunition of damages unler comparative

8

negligence would come into play only in a case under FELA

9

only and not in violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.

24

No.

But you will recall that in F2LA as soon as there

is a violation of the Federal Safety Act the Congress made it
very clear that contributory negligence went out the window
altogether.

15

16

Q

Q

It was absolutely irrelevant no matter how

A

Now FELA, of course, was pass 2d in 1908 and by

great.

itself it covered only railroad employees.

This act did set

out a specific cause of action, Federal caus2 of action.

It

provided that in a suit under FELA alone as */e have just
pointed out the contributory negligence of tie employee would
diminish damages if it was only under FELA aid would do away
with contributory negligence if a violation of the Federal
Safety Act did apply.
In those early cases under both FELA and the Safety

25

7

1

Act liability in those days was thought of ir traditional

2

negligence terms -

3

The charges to the juries in those days and even

4

language in this court's opinions in those es.rly days talk

5

in terms of negligence and terms of due care and I think it

6

is hardly surprising that this court in those early cases

7

accepted the general doctrine that contributory negligence would

8

be applicable.
But beginning in the late 1930's a change began to

9
10

take place in the reading of the Safety Act.

11

have pointed out that the change was comparable to the

12

development or the evolution of the law in regard to Interstate

13

Commerce.

14

restrictions which the State courts were placing on recovering

15

in these cases was not the will of Congress, began requiring

16

stricter standards of liability by the railroads for violating

17

this Safety Act.

18
19

25

Commentators

The court in the late 1930's sens:.ng that the

The court finally said that liability under the Act
had nothing whatever to do with negligence.

Negligence was

completely out of the matter and that the ra..lroad owed an
absolute duty to those properly upon its linos to maintain
its equipment in efficient condition.
Then in due course the court came no the terms
absolute liability and absolute prohibition ;.n interpreting
the Safety Act.
8

Now the use of these terms could hardly have been

1

2

inadvertent or imprecise as suggested by the Iowa Supreme

3

Court,

4

of an independent contractor and, therefore, it had nothing

5

to do with FELA, it was not brought under FELA at all and

6

contributory negligence was specifically treated as a defense

7

in that case.

The Shields case, for example, involved the employ

The trial court instructed the contributory negli­

8

9

gence was not a defense, the railroad made this a point on

10

appeal to the Fifth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit specifically

11

said that the plaintiff was invoking absolute liability.
This court in its opinion mentioned that plaintiff

12

13
14
15
16
17

was invoking absolute liability, and then it went on to say
that violation of the act did result in absolute liability.
Now in the light of the record of a case like that to say that
this court had merely used the term absolute liability loosely
or inadvertently, of course, we say simply makes no sense.
What we are asking here is that this Safety Act be

18
19
20
21

22

interpreted in the light of the overall intent of Congress,
which was to impose upon the railroads whatever liability was
necessary to make them maintain their equipment in proper
condition.
Yet, look what happens now if the court adopts the

24
25

reasoning of the respondent in this case.

The railroad is able

to turn over a car, a defective car to an independent third
9

tl

party such as Cargill»

2

to receive that car back on its tracks for a period of time»

3

Now, if contributory negligence can be asserted by

4
5
6
If

8

an employee of that third party it is very much to the advan­
tage of the railroad to leave that car defective, leave it
defective, wait until it gets back on its line because if the
injury occurs in the interim they are going :o have a lot
easier time of it.
How could that possible have been :he intent of

9
IO
11

\z
13
14
15
16

The railroad knows that it is not going

Congress.

Congress' intent must have been to require the

railroad to fix this equipment at the earliest possible time
and to impose whatever liability that it required them to do it.
And look at what other results have followed here.
In this case the trial court not only placed the burden upon
Mr. Crane to prove by a preponderance or a greater weight of
the evidence that he was not guilty of contributory negligence,
but listen to this, it instructed that if hit contributory

17
18
19

negligence contributed in any way or in any degree directly to
the injury he could not recover at all.
What happened?

20

Mr. Crane thus winds up with less chance of recovery
21

even though the railroad violated the Safety Act than if one
22

of the railroad's own employees had been injured and the
23
railroad had been guilty only of simple negligence, not even of
24
a violation of the Safety Act, because in that case the employee
25
10

•it

could recover diminished damages but at least damages of some

2

kind, whereas in this case the employee of tie third party

3

can't recover at all.

4

Now, we just submit that that coull not possibly have

5

been the intent of Congress, that the intent was entirely

6

the other way, because if it is one thing these two acts show

7

when read together it is that Congress was cincerned primarily

8

about violations of the Safety Act.

9

That is what it was concerned about. If you compare

IO

the statutes every time the Safety Act is me itioned liability

11i

grows greater, the standards become stricter.

12

they were concerned about.

13
14
15
16

17
18

That is what,

The thousands of deaths and injuries that were
occurring because equipment was improper.
Now the type of interpretation that we seek here is
certainly nothing new to the statute.

Time

ind again this

court has read the literal language of the Act in the light of
the overall riding intent of Congress.
In one case, for example, although the Act only

20
21

22

23
24

refers to couplers coupling automatically by impact and
uncoupling without the necessity of going between cars, this
court required in addition that the couplers remain coupled
until set free by some purposeful act or control.

That wasn’t

in the statute.
But this court added it because it thought that that

25
11

1

was the plain meaning of Congress in passing the statute.

12

In another case the court struck the fellow servant defense

3

from Safety Act cases, even though the Act itself made no

4

reference w-atever to the Fellow Servant rule and the court

5

said the obvious purpose of the legislature was to supplant

S

the qualified duty of the common law with an absolute duty

7

deemed by it more just.

8

In still another case it was argued that the Safety

9

Act made clear by its various provisions that it applied only

IO
IB
12

13
14

15
16
17
18
19.

20
21

22

to railroad workers.

And this court held it applicable to

motorists on the highways as well that came across the tracks
and anyone else as a matter of fact who were properly on the
railroad's property.
Still again the court ruled that an assumption of
risk was just as applicable to employees of a connecting
carrier as it was to the defendant railroad, even though the
assumption of risk provision would seem to have been applicable
only to employees of the guilty carrier.
And in that case it is interesting that the court
relied on both FELA and the Safety Act even though the case
was brought only under the Safety Act.
This brings me to the point that has been emphasized
by the court so strongly many times.

That is, that the Safety

23

Act and FELA are really correlative, interdependent, inter­
24

related statutes.

Each gained sustenance fiom the other.

25

12

Each

1

must be read in the light of the other.
And we say that the specific abolition of the defease

2
3

of contributory negligence in FELA permeatas the entire Safety

4

Act.

5

In other words,, so long as the injured party is one

6

who is covered by the Safety Act which is clearly the case,,

7

concededly the case, the railroads should not be able to use

8

contributory negligence to dbfeathim any more than it can now

9

use assumption of risk to defeat him or the Fellow Servant

10

n
12

doctrine to defeat him.
Q

Mr. Prettyman, this action was not brought

under the Federal Employers' Liability Act?

13

A

Correct.

14

Q

It was brought only under the Federal Safety

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Appliance Act.

So I suppose we don’t have before us a question

whether Mr. Crane could be considered as if he were an employee
under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.
I remember vaguely that in some of the Maritime tort
cases there are maybe one or two decisions in ^hich somebody
not an employee conventionally consider was held to be doing
or performing the duties of an employee and therefore would
come within relevant laws.
But that is not involved here because you didn’t bring
the action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.
that what you are asking

So

us to do is specifically and perhaps
13

1

solely to read the Federal Safety Appliance Act as if it con­

2

tained the contributory negligence and absolite liability

3

provisions, whatever they may be, of the Federal Employees'

4

Liability Act.

Is that right?

5

A

6

I am not urging the construction ttat you mentioned

7

Let me put it this way, Mr. Jistice.

simply because I don't think it is necessary.

8

Q

What construction?

9

A

Well, you say to treat him as if he was in fact

10
11

a railroad employee.
Q

Well, I don't care whether yoi think it is

12

necessary or not.

19
20
21

22
23
24

25

A

The suit was not brought x nder the Employer's

Well, the reason it wasn't is that FELA on its

face applies only to railroad workers.
Q

I understand that.

So that pcssibility xvould be

out, anyway?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

All right, now, am I right in saying that what

you are asking us to do is to read the Federal Safety Appliance
Act as if it contained a contributory neglige nee language of
FELA and the glass that has accumulated with respect to FELA?
A
differently.

Yes, although I might put it a little bit
I would say that I am asking you to realize that

Congress could not possibly have meant to dit criminate against
14

1

nonrailway employees reading these two statutas together.

It

2

could not possibly have meant to allow a railroad employee

3

to recover and a nonrailroad employee properly upon the

4

property, properly working on these cars, not to recover under

5

precisely the same circumstances.
I think Congress’ intent if you real these two

6
7

statutes together as the court has said you mast do is clearly

8

to impose, as the court itself has said, absolute liability

9

in either instance.
In the Shields case it was not under FELA either,

10

11
12

your Honor, and yet the court said there was absolute
liability.
Q

13
14
15

It is not inconceivable to me that Congress

might establish one set of rules as to negligance for employees
and another for nonemployees.
A

16

I agree that it is not inconceivable but if your

Honor will look at the legislative history yea will find that
17
10
19

20
21

22

Congress clearly recognized right from the beginning that
others other than railroad employees \*ere goiig to be clearly
affected.
It provided in the preamble to the \ct, for example,
that this was Act was an Act to promote the safety of employees
and travelers upon railroads by compelling --

23

Q

That is the Safety Act.

A

That is correct, sir.

24
25

15

1

And I am saying that the Safety Act provision in

2

FELA, that is the provision that once the Safety Act is violated

3

in FELA you have a higher standard.

4

the--

5

Q

It clearly implies that

I think in a logic course that I took in college

6

would have styled that as running into the fallacy of the

7

undistributed ——

8

Because it is true that Congress talked about the

9

Safety Appliance Act as having a bearing upon employees but it

10

did not talk about or did it talk about the Federal Employers’

1I

Liability Act as having an applicability to lonemployees?

12

A

Well, the FELA, of course, was passed later, in

13

1908, and that statute provides as you know simply that once

14

the Safety Appliance Act is violated, the contributory negli­

15

gence goes out.

16
17
18
19
20
21

22

23
24
25

This court has gone on in later cases to make clear
the class of people who were covered by the Safety Appliance
Act, greatly broadening it and we simply say that this court
has recognized that you are not going to discriminate when you
raise these two Acts together unless you find specific
Congressional intent to rule out this kind of interpretation.
And we certainly find no legislative history of any
kind indicating any attempt to discriminate against or make
the burden greater for the nonrailroad employee.
I grant, your Honor, that perhaps it would not be
16

i

beyond the power of Congress to do so.

But ihe point of it is

2

that we carit find any indication that, they did intend to do so.
Now we pointed in our brief to all kinds of defenses

3
4

that the States could use and they are presently using in

5

their State casefs in ordinary negligence actions to defeat

(6

claims by plaintiffs.
And if all these are applicable

7

ii

the respective

8

States under the Federal statute we say it is going to encourage

9

exactly what Congress was attempting to frustrate, namely a

to
11

12

spotty and differing recovery in each State mder the Federal
statute depending upon whether the local rula happens to be
stringent or liber in the particular case.
So in summary we say that absent tie specific intent

13
14
15
16

17

to discriminate that the court’s use of the term absolute
liability in recent years in these cases was purposeful, and tha c
so long as there is a defect, as clearly there was here, so
long as there is a causal relationship betwean the defect
a nd the injury that liability automatically :ollows.

10
We submit that we are long past the day when an

19
20
21

22

employee merely because of some negligent ac:, no matter how
slight, thereby excludes himself from all recovery under
remedial legislation of this kind.
I will save the rest of my time for rebuttal, if I

23
may.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. DALLAS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

3

MR. DALLAS:

Mr. Chief Justice.

4

Your Honor put the finger on the vary pulse of this

5

problem here and the question is when the Iowa court decided

6

it on the basis that this was an action brought by a non­

7
8

9
10

employee of the railroad and that only in those instances
where the action was brought by a railroad enployee was the
plaintiff entitled to claim the benefits of bhe Federal
Employers' Liability

The court cited the many, many casas which had been

11

12

13
14

decided by this court which held that contributory negligence
was a defense in all those actions except where the Federal
Employers' Liability Act was involved.
What we in effect have here is an andeavor to reverse

15
16

17

a construction of the Federal Employers' Liability Act that
has been in existence for almost 60 years.
The very first case that this court had occasion to

Act.

pass on the Federal Safety Appliance Act was the Schlemmer
case.

It was decided in 220 U.S.

That was an action that

involved an injury to a railroad employee in a situation where
the injury occurred prior to the time of the adoption of the
Federal Employers' Liability Act.
The case was tried with a jury in bhe State court and

24
the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff under
5

18

1

instructions with respect to contributory negligence.

2

State trial court granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict

3

on the theory that the plaintiff was guilty :>f contributory'

4

negligence as a matter of law.

5

The

It was then appealed to the Suprems Court of Pennsyl­

6

vania and they held that the decedent in that case under the

7

facts of that particular case was guilty of contributory

8

negligence as a matter of lav/and said •— and then the case came

11
12

21

here and this court said that contributory negligence continues
as a defense unless it is taken away by statute.
There was no statute at the time tiis action occurred
which took it away.

Therefore it continued to be a defense.

Now I want to just say a word or two about that
Schlemmer case because of the contentions that are made with
respect to it in petitioner's brief.

They say that this court

has misinterpreted over the many years the true import of the
Schlemmer opinion.
Now, the Schlemmer case very definitely discusses
what is contributory negligence, namely, the failure of a
party to take those precautions for his own safety that another
reasonably prudent person would under the sane or similar
circumstances.

22

Now, they say applying that rule to the facts of that
23

case the State court was correct in concludi ig that the
24

decedent failed to take those precautions an 1 he was not
25

19

1

entitled to recovery because contributory negligence continued

2

to be a defense.

3

Now the next case that we have after that arose

4

under the Act of 1893, which was the original Federal Safety

5

Appliance Act, then in 1908 we had the Federal Employers8

'6

Liability Act.

7

But as you recall under the Federal Employers®

8

Liability Act as it was first enacted it only covered those

9

employees who were actually engaged in Interstate Commerce.

10

So that a person could be a railroad employee and if

11

his activities at the time of his injury were intra-state

12

activities then he was not entitled to the benefits of the

13

Federal Employers' Liability Act.

14

So he stood in the same posture with respect to his

15

claim that the ordinary

16

employee was.

17

individual who was not a railroad

We had a series of case that articulated the import

13

of the Schlemmer case, applied that rule, carried it on, and

19

held that insofar as the Federal Safety Appliance Act was

20

concerned, of course, a Federal question was presented as to

21

what its proper construction was.

22
23
24
25

What they said that "An injured party who is not
entitled to the benefits of the Federal Employers' Liability
Act did not have a Federally creative cause of action.

Thcit

this duty to have cars equipped with those appliances which
20

1

were in conformity with the Safety Appliance Act was an abso­

2

lute duty.

3

was to substitute a strict and absolute obligation specified

4

by statute in lieu of the ordinary common-lav, obligation to

5

maintain your cars in a reasonably safe condition.

6

The only effect of the Federal Safety Appliance Act

Now, true, and from the very beginring this Court

7

has held that that is an absolute requirement, imposed an

8

absolute duty to comply with those strict requirements of the

9

Federal Safety Appliance Act, and it is an obligation that

10

cannot be avoided by any degree of care no raetter however

11

acidulous, as Mr. Chief Justice Hughes said in the Brady case.

12

So we come in to a situation here where we start out

13

any person injured as a result of a defective Federal appliance;

14

it doesn't make any difference who that person is.

15

25

He is

He may a person approaching a railroad crossing, he
may be a man climbing on a car, any person, as you very, very
distinctly said who needs the protection of that Federal
Safety Appliance Act is entitled to it.
And that duty is an absolute duty and one that can
result in a situation where a person injured can impose liabilit /
upon a railroad without fault.

You can have a situation here

where you, as we say under the facts of this very case, if
liability were to be imposed here it would be without fault
on the part of the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railroad, because
21

1

at the time these cars were delivered, they were firmly

2

coupled together, at the time they were uncoupled by these men

3

who were employees of Cargill for the purpose of weighing,

4

the couplers were functioning in perfect order.

5

It was no dispute but what these cars at the time

6

they were delivered were in absolute perfect condition.

7

we have a situation here where this case was brought as it

S
3
SO
11

12

c ould be in three counts.
1.

Ordinary* common-law negligence for delivering a

car that was not equipped with proper couplers.
2.

Failure to deliver the car that, was in conformity

with the Federal Safety Appliance Act.

13

3.

At the conclusion of plaintiff's case the court

15
16
17

19
20
21

22

23
24

Now,

Res ipsa loquitur.

directed a verdict against the plaintiff on all claims that were
based on common-law negligence because viewing the evidence
from the light most favorable to the plaintiff the jury would
have found that there had been any negligence on the part of
the railroad company in delivering those cars that verdict
would not have had any support in the evidence.
So the case proceeded to trial on this single count
before the jury.

Now in connection with the situation as it

is presented there it was urged throughout the trial that
contributory negligence was not a defense.
When the District Court or the trial court held that

25
22

1

contributory negligence was available to the defense then the

2

petitioner requested a so-called emergency instruction which

3

told the jury that if they found that the plaintiff was con­

4

fronted with a sudden emergency, so that he v/as required to

5

act under circumstances, well he didn't have time for adequate

6

deliberation, then he would not be held to that degree of

7

care that a person would be who v/as not confronted with such

8

an emergency but he would only be required to use that care for

9

his own safety, that a reasonably prudent person would be

required to use under the same or similar circumstances.
So we have a fair, fair submission.
lopsided submission at all.

It is not any

The Iowa court said that the

instructions with respect to contributory negligence were in
full conformity with the Iowa law.

»

Now you are not going to find that instruction in
there, your Honor.

You will find it set out in our brief in

the statement of facts here.
They did not set it out here and the

reason that I

set it out here, you will find on page 4 of the brief for
respondent this is the instruction that they requested and
this is what was given.
"When one is confronted with a sudden emergency not
brought about by his own fault and because thereof is required

23

24

to act upon the impulse of the moment without sufficient time
to determine with certainty the best course to pursue, he is

25

23

1

not held to the same accuracy of judgment as would be required

2

of him if he had time for deliberation.

3

stances he is required to act only as an ordinarily, careful

4

and prudent person would act when suddenly placed in a similar

position, and if he so acts he is not liable for injury or

6

damage resulting from his conduct."

respect to the burden of proof?

That is right, your Honor.

That is in accordance

10

with the Iowa law and the Iowa Supreme Court said that it was a

11

correct statement of the Iowa law on contributory negligence.

12

Q

And your position is that action brought under

13

the Safety Appliance Act does not carry with it an overriding

of the State rule as to contributory negligence?

permit any other conclusion other than the fact that in the
instances where a person who is injured has the right to the
benefits of the Federal Employers' Liability Act that all the
common-law defenses are available.
That is the situation that there can be no escape
from that conclusion.
Now, true, if you have a situation here where this
court is the final harbinger of what the Federal Employers"
Liability Act should be properly construed.
Q

You mean the Safety Appliance Act?

That is right.

In other words, that brings us dowa to three of the

4

more recent cases, the O'Donnell case, the Carter case and the

5

Affolder case.

6

decided within a period of a very few months of each other.

7

They were all automatic coupler cases that were

Those are all instances where the ^ourt had an

8

instance of injury to a railroad employee; hi.s action was

9

brought under the Employers' Liability Act,

and in those cases

10

the court made pronouncements as to the fact that negligence

11

on the part of the railroad, the failure to comply with the

12

requirements of the Federal Safety Appliance Act, those require­

13

ments were absolute and negligence was not an issue with

respect to such compliance.

Mr. Justice Jackson when he wrote the opinion in
the O'Donnell case cited cases that were decided long prior to
the cases to which I have made reference her 2 in support of
this conclusion, that negligence was not an Issue.
Legal excuse would not be available to a defense to
a railroad.

Like you would have in the ordinary State statute

where you have a violation, a technical violation, but if the
party was able to show that he had used every precaution that
was humanly possible to avoid a violation why then it would be
up to the jury to say, "Well, he has a legal excuse," if he
finds that he did everything reasonably poss Lble to avoid

12
13

A

He wouldn't have to prove negligence.

Q

Why not?

A

Well, because the Federal statute — perhaps the

»

14
15

best illustration that I can give is --

16

Q

The short answer is the Federal law controls?

A

In other words, if the --

Q

The Federal law means absolute liability and

17
18
19

20

the Federal law pre-empts State law in this State cause of
action.

Is that right?
A

I think you have pointed up where our line of

21

demarcation is.

A violation of the Federal statute constitutes

22

a violation of an absolute duty and we canno: escape the con­
23

formity with that duty by showing any degree of care.
24

is only one of the ingredients of a cause of action.
25

28

But that

1

In other words, looking to the Federal Safety

2

Appliance Act alone it doesn't create any cause of action.

3

That is what has been so many times held.

4

as Justice Clark said in the Affolder case --

5

6

Q

In other words, it is

Well, what is the cause of action that a plaintif £

asserts when he sues in a State court?
A

7

He sues on the violation of tne Federal Safety

8

Appliance Act as creating the wrong or the breach of duty that

9

is owed to him.

10

Q

11

A

Not a complete cause of action.

12

Q

And it isn't a cause of action the State law

1.3

gives him either, is it?
A

14
15

So it isn't a cause of action for negligence.»?

No, but he must look to the State lav? for

causation, for approximate cause and the other elements that -- Q

He just has to look at the State law for a

18

A

That is what has been said many times.

19

Q

Just as a form?

20

A

Well, in other words, he must look to those

16

21

requirements of the State law for what is an actionable wrong.

22

In other words, the wrong that breach of duty occurs -—

23

24
25

Q

Well, I know but the State law says there isn't

any actionable wrong unless there is negligence.
A
your Honor.

But the State is not permitted to say that,
29

t
2
3
4

Q

Well, then why is it permitted to say that

contributory negligence bars?
A

Well, because the violation of the Safety

Appliance Act does not create a cause of action.

-5

Q

It is only because of the construction of the

6

Safety Appliance Act.

7

A

In other words, the Safety Appliance Act is

8

just a statute, that is all it amounts to and the court has

3

given it a construction that says that that imposes absolute

10

n

duties to comply.
Q

Well, it isn’t much of an absolute duty is it

12

if it can be avoided by showing contributory negligence or

13

just by showing negligence, not contributory negligence,

14

negligence.

15
16
17
18
10

20
21

22
23
24

25

If the employee has been negligent, the absolute
liability goes out the window.
A

Well, in other words, that is where we get into

this confusion when we talk about absolute liability and
absolute duty.

And that is where I think we get into the

problems that I am going to avert to that aspect of the
case in a moment.
But here, to put it this way, in tie Fairport case
which is the first case where a person approached a railroad
crossing and was struck by a train that didn't have the proper
power brakes as required by Section 1 of the Federal Safety
30

1

Appliance Act.

2

whether contributory negligence of this person approaching the

3

railroad crossing would be a defense or more properly speaking

4

in that case whether last clear chance was available to avoid

5

the consequences of failure to use proper precautions when

6

approaching a crossing.

Then the question got into the case as to

And this is what Justice Sullivan said in the Fairport

7

8

case.

He said, "The effect of the Federal Safety Appliance Act

9

is to transform a common law duty to use ordinary care into

10

an absolute duty which is imposed by statute.

11

duty cannot be escaped by showing of care on the part of the

12

railroad.

13

And that absolute

But that is only one side of the aspect.

He has to

14

look further to the State law to the right, as they say,

15

springs from the State law to recover.

15

State law to see whether the State law permits whether he has

17

got approximate causation or whether he has --

18

Q

So he must look to the

Yes, but you also have to look to the Federal

19

law to see whether or not the Safety Appliance Act itself bars

20

the defense of contributory negligence, just like it bars or

21

22
23
24
25

just like it precludes the State conditioning recovery on
negligence.
A

That is right.

In other words, and that is why I have been endeavorin 3
to say, your Honor, that your earlier cases have held that there
31

1

is nothing in the Federal Safety Appliance Act which took away

2

the defense of contributory negligence.

3

language of Schlemmar.

4

That is the exact

In the absence of something taking it away why it

5

continues to exist.

6

from those earlier cases and now take on a d:.fferent view on

7

the theory that there has been a change of philosophy with

8

respect to that.

9

And that is where you are asked to depart

And that is what I want to get into in a minute.

10

Q

May I ask you one question?

11

A

Yes, sir, your Honor.

Q

Suppose the Securities and Exchange Act has made

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

IS
20
21

22
23
24

it illegal to trade in a certain fashion and a suit is filed
in violation of that where a man suffered.

Would that be

governed State or Federal law?
A

Well, there are a number of those cases, your

Honor, where they have said that — it would constitute I
assume that you would not have any elements of contributory
negligence.
Q

Well, why if the State had contributory negli­

gence about that couldn't it put it in?
A

Under your argument.

Well, in other words ——

Q

Maybe the State has a differejit rule about it.

A

What I am endeavoring to say :.s this t

That the

way the statute has been construed up to now they have said
25

32

1

that it did not provide a complete cause of action and you had

2

to look beyond the Safety Appliance Act for certain other

3

elements that were essential to a complete cause of action.

4

And in the case of the injured employee he looked

5

to the Federal Employers" Liability Act, and as you have said

6

in the Carter case the wrong that resulted from a violation of

7

the Safety Appliance Act provided the element that gave him

3

the cause of action under the Federal Employers" Liability

9

Act.

to

Now we have no counterpart of that unless you are

11

going to say that all people, whether they be employees or not

12

should be treated on a same basis.

13

Q

Well, the substance of your argument then is

14

as I understand it is that the Federal Employee — the Safety

15

Appliance Act was not intended to afford protection to anybody

1G

in the world except employees.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

A

No, that is not, your Honor.

In other words, in fact, I realize that has been quite
the contrary in your holding here.

You had Ccray versus

Southern Pacific Railroad case and in that case you held it
quite to the contrary.
Q

Did I hold it?

A

You spoke for the court.

Let me put it that way.

And you said that Federal Safety Appliance Act provided a
protection to whoever got hurt as a result cf it.
33

And that has

1

been the whole import of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.

2

was not a statute.

3

railraod employees alone or any particular person who might

4

be doing any particular thing at the time he was injured.

5

It was enacted for the benefit of any

In other words, it was a broad thirg to protect the

6

public generally against injuries as the court said in that

7

case from any defective appliance that was used.

8

It

So we start out here that every menber of thepublic,

9

it is not a statute of the type that you have in many cases

10

where you have a statute enacted for the benefit of miners,

11

for example, and there you say well you can't plead con­

12

tributory negligence in that because this is a statute as they

13

say it is enacted for the benefit of those people who are

14

unable to protect themselves.

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

That is the general type.

Now this statute has never been protected, has never
been construed in that aspect at all.
situation where you must look further.

So that you have a
Now, I see my time

is past, passing and I just wanted to say a vord in concluding
about the Shields case here, which is a case to which
Mr. Prettyman has referred.
Now that is a case and I have read with very great
interest the official transcript in that case which sets out
all the instructions of the trial court and so forth.

And I

think that if you will follow that case down you will find
that everything that he says is true with respect to it.
34

1

except there was no instruction given in that case by the

2

trial court either oral or written.

O

out in the record, with respect to the question of the

4

plaintiff's contributory negligence.

5

At least it is not set

And he tried his case both on two counts, one on

6

common law negligence and the other on the violation of the

7

Federal Safety Appliance Act.

8

on either and the reason is rather obvious because the railroad

9

was endeavoring to make a defense in that case on the theory

10
11
12

13
14

15
16

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

And there was no instruction

that the defect in that so-called running board had been painted
over so that their inspector as well as the plaintiff couldn't
determine whether there was any defect in it.
Therefore, they were trying to make a defense on the
theory that they couldn't know about it and the plaintiff
couldn't either.

So the case went to the jury and the jury

returned a verdict for the plaintiff on both counts and then
when it got to the Court of Appeals, and you will notice in
the Fifth Circuit, they discussed only the question and they
defeated the plaintiffs solely on the grounds that this socalled running board was not a safety appliance within the
meaning of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.
•

<» —«vfl

They dismissed his case and then it came here to
review and the single question for decision here was whether
this so-called dome step or running board was a safety
appliance within the meaning of the Act.
35

That plus the further

0K

problem as to whether he had to be a member of the general

2

public or whether he had to be a railroad employee to claim

3

the benefits of the Act.

4
5

The court said that this was a safety appliance and
that ended that.

6

Then the next they said well he was a member who was

7

entitled to the protection of the Act and here is where we get

8

the language that has been the subject matter of our haggling;

3

therefore, the liability is absolute.

10

Now there wasn't any intention we say, in that case

11

to reverse these earlier cases at ail.

12

one of the cases cited is the Fairport case which very

'S3

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

In fact, the court is

definitely and specifically held that the last clear chance
was available, it was a local problem, it didn't present a
Federal question at all and therefore you have a situation
where we say that that case is not, there wes no issue of
contributory negligence in that case at all when it reached
this court and there wasn't any in it when it reached the
Fifth Circuit.
Because when you read over the instructions you will
find that the court never gave an instruction on contributory
negligence.
True, as Mr. Prettyman says, the railroad accepted
to the court instructing that contributory negligence would not
constitute defense.

But there wasn't any such instruction
36

I don't think that has been finally decided.

A

There is clearly a cause of action

Schlemmer said that it is a Federal question whether a

Q

And if it weren't, the case wouldn't be here.

11

A

Exactly.

12

So what do you have?

You have this court saying that

13

under these Federal statutes brought in State courts we must

14

look to Federal standards to see defenses and other matters

15

which go directly to the question of liability.
All right.

Schlemmer, I think that Schlemmer doesn't stand for the out­

Schlemmer.
Q

9

The court has already construed the Safety

Appliance Act as not, as not preventing or as not eliminating

11

contributory negligence as a defense.
A

12

It has already done that.

In Schlemmer if you interpret it that way, it

13

did.

In other cases, following Schlemmer it is entirely

14

different because the jury verdicts were always for the

plaintiff.

Have there been any attempts to amend the Safety

If you go to these cases like Shields and Affolder,

Carter and O'Donnell and Brady and Myers, what does it mean if

They are not just talking about absolute

Yes, it is my position that it was in Shield.

It was pleased in Shield.

It was clearly presented I contend

in the instructions to Shield, at least they objected to the
instruction that the contributory negligence was deemed not
to be a defense in that case and Shield was solely under the
Safety Appliance Act, not under FELA.
Now it is my position that FELA shows the way only in
terms of the legislative intent to make this act one of
absolute liability and tat in no other way can you possibly
carry out the intent of Congress.
If you are going to say that it is a Federal standard
that contributory negligence applies if the State says so you

end up with a case like this one where a jury was allowed to

I say that could not conceivably have been the intent
of Congress.
Your Honor, the only thing I would note in addition

G
7

to that is that there was a mention of this emergency instruc­

8

tion and an attempt to show that really what went to the jury

9

was fair.

I need only to say that we clearly told the court

10

that that instruction was given solely because of our con­

11

tributory negligence argument had been rejected and if you are

12

going to talk about unfairness, let us look at this man who

13

had been employed for six months, who admittedly was not a

14

railroad worker, who did not know anything about couplers, and

15

yet he is being contributory negligent because he didn’t see the

16

pin drop or he didn’t stretch the car.

17

unfairness comes in these cases and that clearly is not what

18

Congress intended when it said that the railroads had to keep

19

this equipment in good condition.
