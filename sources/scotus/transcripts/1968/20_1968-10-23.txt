ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. NABRIT, III, ESQ,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, NABRIT;

7

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the.

8

Court, this case is here on certiorari the second time to re­

9

view a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of North

JO

Carolina affirming an order that petitioner and her four children

f!

foe evicted from a low-income public housing project in Durham,

12

North Carolina,
The question for decision is whether tenants in

13

14

federally financed projects, operated under the United States

15

Housing Act of 1937, as amended, may be evicted from their

18

homes and their Federal benefits terminated without being told

17

any reason or given any opportunity to be heard in their own

18

defense before the decision to evict is made by the Housing

19

Authority,

20
21

25

Let me emphasise at the outset that in our view the
fundamental, underlying question hers is whether poor people
who depend on -the Government for the necessities of life will
get the same kind of procedural rights and protections that our
system has long given to more fortunate citizens in their con­
tacts with Government administrators.

L

1

Is that really the issue? or an underlying issue !

2

here, that people who have leases with private landlords have,

3

as a constitutional matter, the rights which you are contending

here?

30 days’ notice, and there is no provision for notice or hearing, or a statement of the reason why the leas© is not being

Does the concessionnaire have a constitutional right
to be heard?

The difference I perceive is a difference in the j

Let°s look at the position of the Housing

They claim, after all this transpired, after three year's

of this litigation,- they still maintain that they don't even

that depend on the Government for shelter don't have any rights]

think it is relevant.

The point is not lost on poor people.

10

I think they do understand what is going on when the legal

11

system treats them this way.

12

In addition, the United States makes additional cash

contributions for elderly families and on account of displaced

families, families displaced by Federal projects.

Finally, the United States pays the administrative

Mrs» Thorpe:

’f
Could you tell us how the Housing Authority is

constituted?

15

h

Yen, Mr, Chief Justice,

16

Q

Would you do that briefly, please?

17

A

Yes, Mr, Chief Justice,

18

The authority is created under a North Carolina

19

statute called the North Carolina Housing Authority Laws,

20

General Statutes of North Carolina, section 157.1,

Actually,

21

it is section 157,4 which describes in some detail the pro­

22

cess, it can be filed by petition, by taxpayers, they have to

23

have hearings to determine whether or not there is a housing

24

shortage in the community, there have to be certain specific

25

findings made.

Then the authority is incorporated under State

1

law as a governmental agency.

How are they chosen?

Mr. Edwards has indicated that they are appointed, by

the Mayor of the municipality.

8

tioner’s brief.

It is the Mayor or the Council.

I am sura if is in

As I said at the beginning, it seems to us that it is

to

a commonplace in administrative lav? that governmental agencies

11

grant notice and hearings before taking actions.

12

this is true where the action is based on what amounts to an

13

adjudication, that a citizen is guilty of misconduct.

Particularly
'

14

Tradition of due process rejects the idea of ex parte

15

contraventions.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter once put it that

16

fairness can rarely be obtained by secret, one-sided deter­

17

minations of facts decisive of rights.

18

that principle in numerous cases.

The court has applied

19

As recently as a few terms ago, in a case called

20

Wilner against the Committee on Character and Fitness, the

21

principia was applied to a lawyer whose profession, the right

22

to practice law, was at stake.

23
24
25

It. was applied to meatpackers as long ago as the
famous Morgan cases.
The same principle was- true for the engineer who was
10

i

denied a security clearance and whose right to earn a living

2

was at stake,
I emphasise that the issue here is primarily the

3
4

question of procedural process.

12

But that assumes that there is some sort of a

14

15

of the case,

I would submit the right to be treated fairly

by a governmental agency when it is determining whether or not 1

20

21

the right to fair proceedings.

22

G

So far as the lease is concerned, Mrs. Thorpe

23

may have had her lease terminated just because they were fired

24

of having her there, for no reason at all.

25

On this record,

we cannot assume, can we, that her lease was terminated because;

II

1

she was a leader of this tenants' group or that she was guilty

a

of any sort of misconduct or that anything like that was con”

3

sidered?

4

I will address myself, if I might, Mr. Justice

A

5

Fortas, to the first portion of your question, as to whether or

8

not they can terminate because they were tired of having her

7

there.
It seems to me you have to focus on the statutory

0
9

frame and the permissible kinds of things the authority could

10

do under the statute.

Indeed, a private landlord can evict

11

someone because he wants to make more profit or ha wants the

12

apartment for his brother-in-law, or because he wants to tear

13

the building down, for any number of reasons.

»4

Authority cannot have these reasons.

But the Housing

A

What you are saying is that from the fact that

That is right.

There has to be a reason under

12

I

the statute

2

Q

3
4

What does- the statute say about it?

The statute

doesn't say anything about it,, doss it?
A

The statute does give us some guidelines such

5

as 1410Cg), which is in our brief at page 3a.

6

does lay out the general considerations that, the Government

7

wants considered in this program.

8
3
10
11

1410(g)(2).

It

Let me read it.

It refers to the admission policy, but I feels© it
the admission policy and the right to remain would be under
the same policy generally.

It says:

"The Public Housing Agency shall adopt and promul­

12

gate regulations establishing admission policies which

1.3

shall give full consideration to its responsibility for

14

the re-housing of displaced families, to the applicant's

15

status as a serviceman or veteran or relationship to a

16

serviceman or veteran., or to a disabled serviceman or

17

veteran, and to the applicant's age or disability, housing;

18

conditions, urgency of housing needs, and source of

19

incomes provided, that in establishing such admission

20

policies, the Public Housing Agency shall accord to

21

families of low income such priority over single persons

22

as it determines to be necessary to avoid undue hardship."

23

For example, if a hearing developed that a housing

24

agency evicted a family in order to give a single person hous- j

25

ing, they would bs doing something that would be quite opposed |

13

ri
m

to the statutory policy.

2

Q

Mr. Nabrit, do I assume that when Mrs. Thorpe

3

is put out* she will be replaced with another poor family in

4

exactly the same position that she is in?

5

A

Roughly,

6

Q

Exactly what constitutional provision are you

7

yes.

relying on for your due process argument?
A

8

Mr. Justice Marshal, your question suggests to

8

me that it is relevant to analyse what the tenant has at stake

10

in this, what the Authority has at stake, in determining what

11

procedures fairness requires.

12

What we rely on is the due process clause.

13

to me it is useful to look at the interest of a tenant who is

14

in a low-rent Federal housing project.

15

the general framework of it is pretty well defined by the State

Vo

Federal statutes.

17

that the housing project wouldn’t be built in the first place

18

without specific finding that there was a shortage of housing

19

in the community.
Q

20
21

22
23
24
25

It seems

In the first place,

We know merely from looking at the statutes

Maybe I have not made myself clear.

Let me try 1

again.
But for the fact that she was elected President of

I

this tenants’ union, would you be here?
A

The personal component is part of our case.

My '

answer is yes, because these authorities contend that they have
14

ril: t to kick people out without telling them any reason why.

I

i—>

9

think that alone raises the question of due process,, the ques­

3

tion of procedural fairness.

4

Q

And solely because it is Federal money?

5

A

Yes.

6

Q

So that a member of the authority who has a pri­

7

vate building could put somebody out without a hearing, but he

8

could not vote to put somebody out of a public building?
A

9
10

I can assume that that is so.

I don’t address

myself to that question,
Q

11

You don’t recognise the fact that when a private

12

citizen makes a contract with another private citizen for ren­

13

tal. of an apartment in which he agrees that he can be thrown

14

out without notice,, that cannot be enforced?
A

15
16
17
18

21

22
23
24
25

I said 1 assumed that

this case doesn’t implicate the rights of nongovernmental
agencies.

This case depends on the fact that this is Govern­

ment! that the Government is the landlord.
I was about to address myself to what the tenant has ;

19
20

Wo, I agreed with that.

at stake.

It seems to me just looking at the statute alone,

j

that obviously if tenants who are eligible get into these projects and are then evicted, they stand to lose the only chance
they have to homes which they can afford which are decent, safe'
and sanitary.

I

So what the tenant has at stake is of great value.
15

1

Whether you call it a right, or a privilege, or whatnot, what

2

is at stake

3

Q

Your time is about up.

Can't we dispose of this

4

case on the circular, the HEW direction?

5

remembering, and it is quite a while since 1 read the briefs

6

and record in this case, am I correct in recalling that the

1

local authority held that the circular direction by HEW was not.:

e

retroactive?

Am I correct in

9

A

The court below? yes, sir.

10

Q

And can we dispose of the case if we should con­

11

clude that, as we read this, that the circular of the HEW is

12

retroactive?
A

13

I believe that would be open to the Court.

How­

14

ever, I would urge that the Court dispose of the case on the

15

constitutional issues,

16

pending which involve these same .issues.

U

is growing every day.

18

Q

1 think there are many other cases
The housing program

The issue needs to be decided.

Assuming the circular can be held retroactive,

19

do you think the terms of the circular go as far--as your argu­

20

ment?
A

21

Not entirely.

The circular would have to be con

22

sfcrued in order to give meaning to the content of this general

23

provision.

24
25

The circular is not very specific.
Q

It seems if you are given notice and opportunity

to respond, that would be sufficient.

16

1

A

It is a little more specific.

It indicates„ for

2

example, soma details as to what the notice would have.

3

it is not very clear.

4

Q

Does it provide for a hearing?

5

A

None.

6

Q

On your due process argument -—

7

A

Mr. Justice, we do not contend for a full-

But

8

fledged evidentiary hearing.

We think that the Department of

9

Housing and Urban Development can work out something that is

10

practical in the circumstances. What they do need fe@ foe told

11

is that the tenant evictions of the housing authorities are not

12

being done in fairness.

}■

i

13

Q

What kind of hearing should be held?

14

A

It seems to me it would be ~

15

Q

Representative of the local housing authority?

16

A

Yes, sir.

17

Q

Would she be entitled to a lawyer?

18

A

I don’t believe the authority can exclude the

19
20
21

lawyer, or another representative, a social worker.
Q

Than, of course, wouldn’t it apply to a private

person or group who owned apartment houses?

22

A

That, would not.

23

Q

You ara saying that the Government, even if it

24

sets up rules and says you have to obey them, cannot, like a

25

private apartment owner, oust someone for failing to obey them

17

1

without giving him a haering.

Could that be taken to court ,
■

2

;•

then, that hearing?

3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL K, EDWARDS, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

O

MR. EDWARDS:

Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please

4

as Justice Forfcas suggested, we are at the threshold of develop

5

ing new constitutional concepts about the relationship of the

S

poor with the Government.

7

I don't know whether I can supply much thought, that

8

is worthwhile, except this: that the philosophy that has been

S

developed in the brief of the petitioner, at least by quoting

10

certain individuals such as Professor Jones, Professor Pvich,

11

on the subject on page 36 and 37 of the brief, seams to follow

12

the line of thought that what we are doing is to give the poor

13

the same rights in their contact with Government that is pos­

14

sessed by other people? that is, we equate them, and that we

15

haven't arrived yet, in any case that I know of, where they

16

are given some different rights.

17

When you supply them.with a lawyer because they are

18

poor and can't afford one, you are not giving them additional

19

rights in a sense.

20

fellow who can afford a lawyer.

21

All yon are doing is equating them with the

In this case, you have a lease that is standard pro­

22

cedure between landlord and tenant.

23

with the common law procedures, the common law concepts, the

24

common laws or the statutorylaws applicable to everybody in a

25

landlord and tenant relationship, do not they supply reasonable.

24

Now the question arises

1

standards of fairness?

2

Q

I a.>:n sure, Mr,Edwards, you understood my ques­

3

tion of Mr, Nabr.it,

4

whether the principle of putting the poor on an equivalent

5

basis with people who are better off in terms of legal rights,

6

constitutional rights, whether that principle really got him

7

anywhere in this case, That was my question,

8

A

What 1 was trying to find out from him was

And I am sure it does not, because they are

9

placed on an equal basis here,

The only question, then, is

10

whether one should go further,

1 say not? that perhaps that

11

is a matter that the Congress can consider, as to whether or

12

not they want to make the relationship different, or the State

13

Legislature,
Q

14

Or HEW can do it, presumably, pursuant to its

15

statutory authority, issuing a circular here which does pro­

16

vide a right, for what it is worth,
A

17

18

The circular is the thing I would like to take

up next, if I may,
Q

19

‘
Mr, Edwards, before you get to it, you do recog­

20

nise the difference between the Housing Authority operating

21

under State.and Federal auspices and private apartment house

22

owners?

23

A

There are -differences,

I don’t know — one, the

24

difference would be, I assume, that a housing authority could

25

not say "We will require you to sign a statement that you never
25

1

belonged to certain organisations found by the Attorney General

2

to be subversive as a condition to occupying these apartments„"

3

You can’t do that.

4

these apartments if you decide to vote, or if you decide to

5

make a speech somewhere.

Or you can’t say that you can’t occupy

In other words, I think that to that extent the

6
7

Housing Authority is perhaps in a different situation than the

8

private landlord, although I wouldn’t be adamant in saying that

9

a private landlord might not be constitutionally prohibited,
Q

10
11

Are you familiar with the Wilmington bus situa­

tion?

12

Well, obviously you are not.

13

Once the State takes over, it is not a private busi­

14

ness any longer.

You do recognize the right of HUD to set rule

15

and regulations, or do you not?

16

A

Wo, sir,

You don’t recognise that?

Within the limits of their annual contributions

22

circular is binding or not,
A

23

HUD itself

That is why I wanted to get this preliminary

I say it is not.

The reasons for that are

24

these;

The United States Housing Act of 1937 did provide that

25

HUD could issue certain general rules and regulations to
26

3

implement the chapter, the provisions of the chapter»

2

also provided in there just as clear as it could be that it

3

should deal with housing authorities set up under the State

4

law,, as this one was, under the State statute, by entering into!

5

a contract with them, which is called an annual contributions

6

contract.

But it

It wasn't given the power by any statute to run the

housing authority set-up under the State law by edict or by

9

rule or by regulation absent a contract with that agency, that

local housing authority» It had to have a contract, an annual

contributions contract»

12

power to make rules and regulations was within the framework

13

of the concept that their sole control over this local housing

14

authority was by virtue of the contract for annual contributions

35

that it entered into.

IS

contract.

17
18
19

That is in there, that the general

It had to put the provisions in that

As I say, HUD recognizes this.

The petitioner, in

preparing this case, directed certain inquiries to HUd with
reference to the February 7, 1967 circular and we received

20

some.answers from HUD in response to their inquiry. You will

21

find those in the petitioner's brief on page 48a, Appendix 5,

22

back in the back part of the brief.
,

23

24
25

That is the pertinent one that I would like to call
the Court's attention to.

There HUD says "HUD policy over the

years has been to treat the local housing authorities as
27

?

contracting parties under the annual contributions contract

2

not. Covered by the term 'public5»

3

,

Material issued from time

The Housing Act didn't require that there be inserted

10

in the annual contributions contract any controlling features

11

about eviction or what sort of lease should be given to the

12

tex^ants, and the annual contributions contract itself contained

13

no such provision.

14

Q

Is the Durham Hoxxsing Authority abiding by that?

15

A

It is right now.
i

16

Q

It is abiding by

17

A

It is; yes, sir.

18

Q

But it doesn't consider it to be retroactive?

19

A

It does not consider it to be retroactive.

20

Q

As of tomorrow, a person, Mrs. Thorpe, if she

it?

21

is put back on regular status, could not be put out without

22

a due process hearing?

23

A

I think as a matter of policy, what the Housing

24

Authority would do, as they are now doing, would be to follow

25

the procedures set out in the HUD circular.
23

Q

Since this case is still being litigated,

wouldn't the best way to be just to forget about this?'

**’»

A

To forget about, the eviction?

Q

This one woman„
■

i

S

A

I think as a practical matter,, unless the Court

6

wants to establish some new concept and make some pronounce­

7

ment as to constitutional leaf about the thing —

8
9

Q

Couldn't your clients, without any constitutional
)

law, pronouncements or anything else,, moot this case?

10

A

They could.

11

Q

But they haven't?

12

A

They haven't done 30? that is correct.

13

Q

Perhaps I don't understand you, Mr. Edwards.

14

X assumed that everything in the way of directions in the HUD

15

manuals and in the various circulars issued from time to time

16

were binding as a matter of law on the local housing authority.

17

Do you contest that?

18

A

I do, sir.

19

Q

On page 31a of the petitioner's brief is an

excerpt from the Low Rent Housing Manual.

21

that time, has established minimum requirements with local
,

23
24
25

authorities.

■ j

I don't think that is correct.

20

22

i

It says HUD, PHA at

Do you think it has exceeded its statutory

authority?
A

Not necessarily.

I think the annual contribu­

tions contract that HUD writes --

29

:

ii

Q

Does that exhaust its authority?

2

A

That HUD writes, the annual contributions con­

3

tract, the authority enters into that contract with it.

4

Q

And that, exhausts its authority?

5

A

It does, unless the contract provides that cer­

6

tain things shall be done pursuant to HUDr s from time to time

/

directives and advice.

o

Q

9

to manual or circulars or regulations to be issued by HUD?
A

10

n

Does the term "directive” contain any reference

No,, sir.

It does not provide that HUD be given

that authority.
Q

12

This says below, on the same page, the PHA manuals

13

contain the requirements to supplement the provisions of the

14

contracts between the local authority and the PHA.

15

change vour view, 1 take it?
A

16

That doesn*jfc

No, sir^ because I think what they are talking

17

about are those areas where there needs to be some rule-making,

18

for example with respect to the keeping of records.
Q

19
20

I suggest you look at page 32a, the second para­

graph, with respect to the operation of the projects.
A

21

That is the PHA requirements.

Tfiere, again, this

22

is the housing manual that is issued, and the annual contribu­

23

tions contract under the statute is the connecting link between

24

the two.

25

in that contract which is really the only link between this

We say there just hasn't been anything shown to be

30

ii

Q

If we assume that this circular is binding on

2

the local housing authority, there is no question that it would

3

require notice, efc cetera, to a tenant upon termination of her

4

tenancy?

5

A

I don't think it would, sir, necessarily, as a

6

matter 'of lav;, and for this reason:

7

lar itself, the first paragraph makes an announcement of fact,

8

and there have been a lot of evictions around the country,;,

9

with public dissatisfaction about it,

10

If you analyze the circu­

The second paragraph says "We" — that is, HUD

'it

"believe that it is essential to advise with the tenant before

52

the eviction action is taken,"

53

Then the third paragraph says that in addition to

14

advising with the tenant, from this date the local authority

15

shall keep certain records»

!6

In analysing what they meant by the circular, it is

57

significant, I think, that HUD does have the authority under

58

th® annual contributions contract and under the statute to

59

require the local authority to keep records.

20

fcive part, the mandatory part of this circular, related to the j

21
22
20

24
25

keeping of records.

The only direc-

It sa3/s "from this date forward you shall

keep certain records,"
The statute set forth on page 7a of the petitioner's
brief sets that out, that HUD does have authority to require
the local authority to keep records.
31

So when they wrote this

j

\

circular, they gave one paragraph of information about what

2

was going on, the second paragraph about what they believed,

3

and then a third paragraph which directed then, pursuant to

4

their authority, to require records to be kept»

S

Q

So you think we have to decide a constitutional

6

question here because you think the circular is just the state­

7

ment of a belief which may or may not be imparted by the local

8

authorities as praiseworthy but certainly is not binding?

9

A

I think that is correct,

10

Q

Let me ask you this questions

Putting the ques­

11

tion of retroactivity aside for a moment, and taking it as it

12

was when this woman was first evicted from her premises, sup­

13

pose this housing authority, which is employed by the Mayor.

14

of the city, was following the practices of many cities in the

15

South of resisting integration of any kind, and it took the

16

process of throwing out every Negro who came into the apartment

17

house on 15 days8 notice without any mention at all of why it

18

was done, and absolutely defeated the purpose of this Act,

19

which is to give all poor people an opportunity to have decent

20

housing in the community in which they lived.

21
22

23
24
25

Would you say if the commissioners appointed by the
liayor, and the management that they appointed, took that kind
of a position and ejected every Negro who had been admitted to
the apartment house, that no Negro could complain in the courts
{
t
because no reason was assigned for his eviction?

i

1

A

No, sir i I certainly would not.

I would say

2

that they would he violating the Constitution of the United

3

States and probably the Constitution of North Carolina! if they

4

acted in such a fashion.
Q

S
6

the reason for his ejection or if it wasn't?
A

7
3

Why shouldn't he be entitled to know if that was

In court I think he would be entitled to inquire

into the matter.

9

Q

.In your eviction process?

10

A

In the eviction process.

That is one point

11

where I disagree with my friend, on the effect of going into

12

court on an eviction process and proceeding.

13

stitutional issues are relevant there, and can be raised in any

14

court in any stage of the proceeding if they are constitutional

13

issuest requirements of the Constitution.

16

couldn't say, "You

the court."
Q

The eviction statute

cannot raise a constitutional issue before

sideration of any binding rules of the Federal authority.

I think con-

these courts.

Exactly so.

So you have to consider them in

There is no question about it.

The trial judge

before whom the matter is brought, if you say "They are vio~
lating my constitutional rights here," would have to consider
it.
Q

I understood that you thought that because they

had made a contract in connection with this tenancy,, that there

2

was no substantial difference between the case where the

3

Government is the owner and the case where the landlord is a

4

Drivate individual, and that all he would have to show would

5

be that, by contract with this tenant, it is to the effect

6

that "On 15 days’ notice, I can terminate the tenancy and I

7

don't have togive any reason at all for it»"

8
9

A

No, sir; we don't take that position.

We fake

the position that constitutional issues would be relevant as

50

they Were ruled on here in this very case.

First Amendment rights had not been violated.
Q

It isna t true, then, that in the courts of North

Carolina all they had to show was 15 days® notice was given?
A

No, sir;; they did not hold that in this case,

because the finding was, when she raised the issue and said
"My First Amendment rights have been violated,” the court did
not deny her a hearing on that but, instead, held a hearing on
it, and permitted evidence to be introduced.
There wasno denial of any request by the petitioner
to cross-examine anyone, and .no denial of the petitioner of

her right to introduce any evidence that she saw fit on this

that you claim the rights should be raised in the court, and

That is our difference.

21

are entitled to that?

22

A

Yes, sir.

We say that during the trial, the

23

defendant did not quarrel with the nature of the scope of the

24

judicial inquiry — that is thepetitioner — but contended only

that was found to be relevant by the Trial Court and passed uponj

by the Trial Court and, of course, when it was here before, ther

13

was some language in the opinion of the Supreme Court that indi­

14

cated it might be considering it irrelevant that such an issue

15

be raised.

16

But when it went back for rehearing, the court re­

17

viewed the. matter and said, in effect, that the Trial Court

18

had before it whether her First Amendment rights had been vio-

19

lated, and so on, and that the Trial Court decided the issue on

20

competent evidence and it should be sustained.

21

Q

Mr. Edwards, would you take the same position if ■

22

this were a housing project that was privately owned and had

23

exactly the same facts?

Let's take a more dramatic illustration such as the
Chief Justice put to you, a privately owned housing project

3

It is the

Would you say the tenants can’t challenge the termi­

4

nation on the constitutional grounds; that they wouldn’t have a

5

constitutional basis for challenging if they could demonstrate

6

the termination was because they were Negroes?

7

A

If I were a representative of the tenants, or if

8

I were a judge considering the matter, I would say they would

9

have a valid right xmdex* Shelly versus Franklin, or cases of

10

that sort, in which they go into the court and ask the court to

11

enforce something such as the trespass in a criminal case or an

12

eviction proceedings, when you say the Constitution forbids the

13

State Court from talcing this kind of governmental action to im­

14

plement that kind of denial of constitutional rights.

15

Q

So that this is a qualification of the property

18

owner's right in his property, that is, the qualification being

17

that he cannot discriminate on the grounds of race to the extent

!8

of terminating the tenancy of the person because they are Negroep?

19

A

It would certainly be arguable.

20

Q

We can argue anything.

I am asking, is that the

21

principle upon which your brief is based?

22

Public Housing Authority of Durham could not lawfully terminate

23

the tenancy of Mrs. Thorpe if it did it for the reason that she

24

organised this tenant union, then you are assuming that she has

25

a constitutional right.
37

When you say that the

3ft

My question to you is whether she has that constitu­

2

tional right, because this is a public agency, or would she have

3

that constitutional right even if it were a private agency?
A

4

The only answer I can give is that most of the

S

cases in the past have said that the fact that it was a govern­

6

mental agency brought about that issue and that the restrictions

7

of the Constitution were framed to restrain Government because

8

it had unusual powers.,

9

Q

The only reason this is a constitutional right

10

is because this is Government.

You seem to

I tend to agree with you.

Let's assume that in the eviction hearing the lessee
who is being evicted says, "1 am being evicted because I organis sd
some tenants," or "I made a speech/' and the Administrator of
the Housing Authority goes on to say, as he did in this case, I
think, "That isn't the reason at all.”

The lawyer for the

tenant says, "What reason was there?1! and he said, "Non e of
yoxsr business."
Can he get away with that?

No, sir.

Does he have to answer the question?

it didn't have any power or authority greater than that.

The court listened to evidence

Let me read to you from the findings of the court,

from the transcript;
"By giving the defendant written notice of termination

21

of her lease on the 12th day of August 1965, the plaintiff

22

This is the

"The defendant having gone into possession as tenant

of the plaintiff and having held over without the right to

her to restore the plaintiff with possession of what ade­

6

tod then furthers

8

"It is immaterial what may have been the reason for

That is the end of the judgment.

But you see, this has been to the Supreme Court

of North Carolina twice.
Q

That was the first time.

But where did they ever say that she has a con-

16 ’ stitutional right to test these other matters?
17

A

When it went back on rehearing, they considered

18

that matter, and the Supreme Court of North Carolina on rehearini

19

on page 39, said "She refused to vacate, charging her lease was

20

being vacated because of her having been elected President of

21

the Parents* Club.

No evidence was offered as to the purposes

of the club, nor that its activities conflicted with the interesI

What 1 am saying is when it went back to the Supreme
Court of North Carolina —-

6

Q

Do you mean on remand?

7

A

On your remand; yes, sir.

They said not neces™

8

sarily a different thing, but they amplified what their meaning

8

was.

When we were here before, my contention was that this

10

language in this per curiam decision meant only that it was im­

11

material under the showing and the evidence that was presented

12

there, what their reason might have bean, because there was no

13

showing of any constitutional violation by the petitioner.

14

For that reason it became immaterial.

But there was

15

no holding even then that she could not have the opportunity to

16

show that any constitutional right was violated.

17

When it went back to the Supreme Court of North Caro­

18

lina on rehearing, the court went further into that particular

19

point, on the finding that her First Amendment rights had not

20

been violated by the Trial Court, and said that since they were

21

based on competent evidence, those findings by the Trial Judge

22

which appear in Finding No. 10 should be sustained.

15

Q

It didn't say that,

16

A

I am saying that is what it means.

All it says

17

is that it is immaterial.

But I think you have to construe what

18

you are talking about in terms of the case that was then before

19

them, which was a case that had come before them with a finding

20

of fact by the Trial Judge that First Amendment rights had not

21

been violated, and that there had been no request by the peti-

22

tioner for further exploration by the Trial Court to enter any

23

reason, and there had been no objection or exception taken to

24

any action by the Trial Court vis-a-vis any further exploration

25

of what the reasons might have been.
45

1

In that context, I take it that on appeal to the
Supreme Court of North Carolina it really was immaterial.

to those things.

10

there was no request made upon the Trial Court to broaden the
scope of this inquiry *

The fact that he didn't do it on his own motion was

not excepted to, either.

When he went from the Trial Court to

20

the Supreme Court they didn't take exception to the failure

of the Trial Court on its own motion to make further inquiry

and broaden the scope of its inquiry into the reasons for the
