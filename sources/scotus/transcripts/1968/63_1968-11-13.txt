PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

No. 63, the State of Ohio

ex rel., Nellie Hunter, on behalf of the City of Akron, versus
Edward 0. Erickson, Mayor of the City of Akron, et al.
THE CLERK;

Counsel are present.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. CARTER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. CARTER;

This case is here on appeal from a

judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio, which construed as
consistent with the Constitution of the United States a charter
amendment to the City of Akron, amending its No. 137 as set out
at page 37 of our record.
This charter amendment requires that before any
legislation designed to regulate housing or real property on
the basis of race is enacted, it has to be approved by a
majority of the electorate.
Moreover, it states that any legislation which has
been adopted making this regulation will cease to be effective
until approved by the majority of the electorate.
We contend that Section 137 is inconsistent with the
14th Amendment requirements.

The facts are not in dispute and

are reasonably uncomplicated.
In July of 1964, the City Council of Akron enacted a
Fair Housing Ordinance.

It made findings of fact that certain

citizens were required to live in segregated conditions and
3

under unhealthy conditions because of housing discrimination,
and that this kind of discrimination produced various social
evils which were adverse to the health and well being of the
city.
It therefore established a commission with power to
investigate complaints of housing discrimination, and to make
findings and to order compliance.

It also directed the Law

Director of the city to take appropriate action when the order
of the commission was not followed.

All housing was covered by

this ordinance.
On August 25 there was filed pursuant to the initia­
tion process which is provided by the City Charter and pursuant
to that a sufficient number of signatures were secured and the
Petition 137 went to the ballot.
It was voted upon in the November 3, 1964 election.
Q

What number of signatures were required to

initiate it?
A

It is 7 percent of the electorate, so that it

varies from time to time.

In any event the City Council

indicated that the requisite number of signatures had been
secured and it was placed on the ballot.
As to the election itself, I think there were about
100,000 votes.

I know that the Charter was adopted by a vote

of something like 69,000 to 44,000.
In January of 1965, the appellant filed a complaint
4

or made a complaint of housing discrimination and requested the
commission which had been set up pursuant to this ordinance to
act.

The commission refused to act and she then went to the

Law Director, and he refused to act and the proceedings were
commenced.
After there were some various procedural problems
involved, and they were cleared away which I don3t think is
germane to the argument of this appeal.

Then the matter was

defended and pressed on the merits.
On the merits, the city defended and said that the
ordinance x^as no longer operative because of Section 137 which
I have indicated.
The Ohio Supreme Court held that 137 x-?as a classification, but it contended it was reasonable because it said that
a city in singling out regulation of housing on racial grounds
was for special treatment and was not acting arbitarily because
of the fact this is a little emotional field and therefore
it indicated this was a reasonable judgment.
We contend that under the decisions of this court
that opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio cannot stand and it
is inconsistent vrith the opinions of this court.
Q

Mr. Carter, the law was suspended by the

charter provision, I gather?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

Hox* would it have been if it were approved?
5

1

Would the City Council have to have passed it again and sub-

2

mitted it, or could it have been done by initiative?

V?O

A

It could have been done either way.

As I
i

4

understand, the lav; was suspended and the City Council could

ii

have either by initiative, or it could have gotten on the ballot,

6

or the City Council could have resurrected it and put it on the

7

ballot again, at which point it would have been voted upon.
Q

0

9

In the charter amendment there was no automatic

provision for getting it on the ballot?
A

10

No, sir, and not only was there no automatic pro­

11

vision, but the provision was that it had to be put on the

f£

ballot at a general or regular election.

13

Q

Has it ever been put on the ballot?

14

A

This past election it was put on the ballot.

15

Q

How was .it put on?

16

A

It was put on by the City Council.

17

Q

Did it pass?

A

No, it did not.

m

19
20

21
22

23
24
23

think.

Q

What was the vote on it?

A

It was a close vote.

The vote was 44,000, I

What was put on the ballot was asking the city whether

or not it would keep or repeal 137.
Q

To keep or repeal?

A

Yes.

Q

Then the open housing ordinance itself was not

.
i

6

1

put on the ballot?
A

•;>

3

The open housing ordinance — the effect of

repealing of 137 would be to resurrect it.
i
Q

4

What I am trying to get at is this:

I gather

5

if 137 was unconstitutional, then the only way the open housing j

6

ordinance can become operative is that it go on the ballot.

7

That is not what was submitted at the past election?

8

A

That is right.

9

Q

Has it ever been submitted?

10

A

11

j

It ha3 not been submitted to the voters, but the

issue that we have here was submitted.

12

Q

The repeal of 137?

13

A

Yes, sir.

14

Q

May I get back to what Justice White asked you

15
16

17
18
19
20

21

22
23
24
25

earlier?

How do you get under 137, the open housing provision

to a vote?
A

You get the open housing ordinance to a vote by

having the City Council repass the lav; and then it is subI

mitted within 30 days by referendum and it is placed on the
ballot in a general or regular election, and this process
requires 10 percent of the voters to act.
Or the voters may initiate a fair housing ordinance
with 7 percent and they would be able to put a petition to the
fair housing ordinance by initiation of 7 percent and it would
be voted upon.
7

Q

'I4

Does the petitioner or appellant here have a

2

remedy under a State law that was passed subsequent to the

3

events of this litigation?

4

A

No, sir.

5

Q

When was that enacted?

6

A

It was enacted subsequent to the institution of

this case.

7

There is a state law.

■

I think it was passed in 1965.
>

Q

8

There was a State lav; enacted and it was some

time after the institution of this litigation.

9

Would you mind

10

telling us your view as to the bearing of the State law on this

11

case?
A

12

\

I can approach it from several angles.

The

13

State law that was enacted deals chiefly with commercial houses.

14

In other words, the right to live in a house or residential

15

property is not specifically covered by the State law.
i

In some respects it is.

16

In other words, that is as

: .
to advertising and things of that kind.
.

17

18

|

is not as broad as this law.

The State law also

This is a broad provision.

19

covers all residential housing.

20

and the commission can order compliance.

It

It has a commission with power
The State lav; is a

much weaker provision, and I think that as the court said in

21
22

Jones versus Mayer, the issue here, it seems to me, is that the

:

23

&■
25

State law does not displace the local initiative or the fair
housing legislation.
Q

Excuse me, Mr. Carter, but your adversaries say
8

i

on page 2 of their brief that it is amended to make it unlawful
to commit certain discriminatory practices in both commercial
and residential property and to provide the Ohio Civil Rights
4

Commission with enforcement powers»
My specific question to you has to be this:

5
6

Does this

State law enacted after the commencement of the litigation
provide a remedy for the specific complaint of your client?
A

e
£

My contention is that it does not.

The State

,,
law is set out in the appellant's brief on the merits at page 1(

1C

and it covers the refusal to sell and the unlawful practices,

11

the refusal to sell, transfer, lease, and so forth goes only

12

to commercial houses.
There are some provisions in the law that the statute

IS
14

has that covers personal residence but it does not cover the

15

fact of

16

here about refusal

17

renting or moving into residences.

There is someissue

to lend, money, the advertising and soforth.

But it does not create any right to actually occupy

'

18

IS
20
21

22
23

24
25

personal residences.
The appellant would have a remedy under Jones versus
Mayer, but they would not have the remedy of the Government
administrative machinery which is provided by this ordinance,
plus the fact -Q

The

1868 statute does not apply?

A

No,

to this kind of housing at this time.

Q

But

she would have a general remedy?
9

A

i

A general remedy, but the court indicated that

2

even though the

3

as a matter of fact the agency law did not displace it, and

4

what this provided was administrative machinery to effectuate

5

the right.»

6

869 Act provided administrative machinery,

We think that this case is more of a violation as a

7

matter of fact than Reitman versus Mulkey, because of the fact

8

that what occurred here in Reitman versus Mulkey could have

9

been seen as being neutral, because it had nothing on the face

10
11
12

3

of if which would indicate that this was a racial matter.
In this case, on the face of the statute, and ex­
plicitly on the face of the statute, it is said that no race
regulations can be passed without the vote of the people.

We

14

think that this is an explicit race regulation which makes it

13

even a stronger case than in Reitman versus Mulkey, because

16

of the fact it does involve and explicitly involves the

17

Government in the process of maintaining and supporting racial

18

discrimination.

19
20

We also contend that this can't be looked upon as a
mere repeal of the lav;, as if the State v/ere being neutral.

2

What has happened here is that Negroes, those for whom this

22

kind of legislation is needed and intended, are now put to a

23

greater test, are now put to greater burdens to get legis­

24

lation enacted.

25

They are not in the same position as they were before
0

!

a fair housing law was passed»

What they must do now, they must

not only convince the City Council which they had to do in the
first instance, to enact a new law, but they also have to go
i

out and get signatures and they have to get 7 percent or 10

,

percent of the population to sign, and what they also must do
j is convince the majority of the electorate that this kind of
1 legislation should be enacted»

j

Q

Mr. Carter» if I understood your argument, you

would be making substantially the same attack on Section 137
whether or not there had previously been any fair housing
legislation enacted, would you not?
A

I think so, yes.

Q

I understand your argument.

A

I think I would be because I think essentially

what would be occurring is that if 137 were enacted without a
fair housing law, all it would mean would be of course that
under the circumstances I would not be able to show that the
1

group had succeeded in getting fair housing legislation through j
the City Council.
j
Q

That really doesn81 affect your basic consti­

tutional attack on 137, does it?
A
; that it.

Theonly thing I do say is that it seems to me

may sharpen the issue somewhat, because what was in­

volved in Reitman versus Mulkey was whether or not this was a

.j

repeal of a law, and the issue before the court, that the

i

court felt was an issue that they had to ponder, was whether
once you had legislation of this kind, the Constitution pre­
vented its repeal.
Now, in this particular instance, it seems to me that
the issue is presented even more sharply.
Q

I understand your argument.

It is really a

different issue and it isn't Reitman against Mulkey?
A

I think Reitman versus Mulkey covers this case.

1 think Raitman-MuIkey covers this case and I think Justice
Stewart, I think it is an even stronger case than Reitman
versus Mulkey.
Q

Well it may be that if your argument would

address itself to the fact that this may be a different case
it might help you.
You would like to have five members of this court
anyway?
A

I certainly would, under any combination.

Q

Mr. Carter, do I understand correctly that the

Akron Charter also provides that before any tax ordinance can
be enacted, there has to be a vote of the people?
A

Yes.

The respondent raises that.

Q

You raise it in your brief by saying that there

is no other kind of legislation that requires this sort of a
vote, and they respond by saying that you are mistaken, that
the tax legislation does require it.
12

'i

A

I agree.

2

Q

But that is all?

O

A

No» I don't believe that you can make that

4

exception.

Let me tell you what the tax legislation is.
The tax legislation,, 86--A to the Charter, says that

5
6

the

/

any year has to be at a certain specified limitation, and if

8

that limitation can be exceeded, it can only be exceeded with a

9

vote of the people.

10

aggregate amount that may be levied on real property in

There also is a provision in 86-B which states that

11

income taxes that are levied, the income taxes being levied

12

will only last until 1968, and that if it is to be extended

13

it has to be by a vote of the people.

14

Now it is my contention that the property tax does

15

not meet this question because what the property tax limitation

SO

is, is the tax is in favor of property owners.

17

invidious discrimination.

S3

It is not an

What it says is that the City Council says you may

IS­

not tax property owners beyond a certain limitation without

SO

the full approval of the people.

21

a beneficial law for a certain class of citizens which they

22

have been able because of their strength to keep the City

22

Council from moving along.

24
25

So that v/hat we have here is

The income tax provision on the other hand is a pro­
vision which is general and neutral, and all that the people of
13

the city said was that they are experimenting with it and they
indicate that we are not going to allow you to extend it
without our approval.
We don’t believe that helps the response as an answer

j

to our case.

In our case and our argument, we still contend

that 137 is invidious in view of the fact that what it says
to the City Council is that you may not pass any law for the
benefit of housing discrimination for the class of people that
need it without the approval of the entire electorate.
Q

Am I also right in my understanding that any

ordinance passed by the City Council of Akron, unless it is
an emergency order which requires more than a simple majority,
but any ordinance passed is subject to a referendum?
A

Any ordinance that is passed is subject to a

referendum.
Q

It has to be put to referendum by initiative?

A

Yes, but this also does not meet the problem

because of the fact that the initiative and referendum of an
ordinance need not be at a general or regular election, which
is required by 137.
If an act is passed, the initiative referendum may be
in any kind of election and it may be initiated at a special
election, so that what you have here is that even to that
extent what 137 has done is to freeze and clog the political
process against the enactment of law.
14

Now we think that this law is bad because as we have

1

2

indicated in our brief, because what it does is discriminates

3

clearly»

4

clearly against people who need the legislation the most.
Q

5
6

It is racial classification and it discriminates

on?

what part of the 14th Amendment are you relying

Is that the equal protection clause?
A

7

Yes, the equal protection clause.

It is our

8

contention that the legislation such as this, which discrimi­

9

nates against groups of citizens, as it does, that under the

10

decisions of this court as this statute has been construed as

11

being a reasonable classification, it has to have a heavier

12

burden.
What the State would have to show in order to sustain

^3
14

this under the 14th Amendment would be that this would be a

15

regulation which was absolutely necessary for the City of Akron

.16

to meet various of its valid objections that it had a right to

17

pursue.

18
19

20

Q

If the legislation were neutral on its face,

what would you say?
A

I would have to show then, Mr. Justice Harlan,

21

that it is a fact.

22

matter of fact against classes of citizens, I think I would

23

have the same argument.

24

25

If I could show that it

discriminated as a

The point here, however, is that the voters have kept
us from being concerned about an interpretation.
15

They

1

specifically and expressly indicated precisely what the statute

2

meant to accomplish.
Q

3

Are you saying that the legislation is bad on its

4

face because it has a racial classification in it.

5

end of your argument?

6

A

Is that the(

I say it is bad on its face because it has a
• •'

7

racial classification; and therefore it is subject to stricter

3

standards.

Secondly, of course, in effect it does discriminate,
Q

When would a racial classification ever be per­

1!

A

A racial classification, as I understand it --

12

Q

Do you think it is ever justifiable?

13

A

As I understand the decisions of the court,

9
10

missible?

14

McLaughlin and Loving have left open the possibility of the

15

court approving a racial classification.

16

Q

17

A

18

Q

What is your position on it?
I didn't hear you.
What is your position on it?

I suppose your

19

argument would be one way, and if any racial discrimination

20

is bad per se, you could stop there.

21

Do you think it. is or not?

22

A

An invidious racial classification, it seems to

23

me, is one of course which I would feel that the Constitution

24

would reach.

25

Q

Is that a redundant statement?
16

j

A

1

I think so, but I think this is why this court

2

has said, because of the fact that there might be racial

3

classifications for legislation to benefit groups of people,

4

under certain needs which they have, which this court left open

5

in both cases, the fact that they are not -—

6

7

So you do have to go beyond the face of the

A

The first thing it seems to me is that you go

statute?

8

9

Q

through the statute.

If I have a race classification, what I

10

say about a race classifications is that reasonableness is not

11

enough.I think that once you take the

12

regard,

statute from that

as I understand, this court has applied that principle.
As to whether you will approve the race classifica­

13

14

tion, then you go to its effect, to determine as a matter of

15

fact whether the classification is necessary for the object that

16

the State is entitled to pursue.
Q

'17

18

Don’t we also have to take into consideration

whe ther this is a specific housing ordinance?
A

19

Yes, sir, and in fact it was aimed at a specific

20

fair housing ordinance and nullified it or

21

aside.

22
23
24
25

Q

at least set it

In this instance what is your standard, a com1

pelling state or simple rationale?
A

It has to be a compelling thing and one that the

State can show is necessary.
17

Q

You have said compelling.

But have we said that;

A

In the various classifications I think the term

used is "Necessary for the pursuit of a valid objective."
Q

Is that different and does it put a greater

burden on the State to make it compelling?
A

I wouldnot think so, but I am not in a position

Q

But you think "necessary"

to say.
or "compelling" are

different from your rationale?
A

That is right.

Q

Would you say the desire to aid or to further

the interests of a specific class of people would be necessary
or compelling enough for that classification?
A

It would appear to me, Mr. Justice White, that

then in terms of its effect, of what the court would look to,
would be to see whether omot what the State was aimed at was
an objective legitimate.
Q

So it has to be a legitimate objective?

A

Of the State.

Q

To justify that, and it doesn’t have to be

compelling?
A
necessary.

It has to be compelling and it has to be

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE

OFFICE OF TIIE SOLICITOR GENERAL
MR. CLAIBORNE:

the court.
Perhaps I should say a word to explain the presence

S
€

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

of the United States in this case, which is perhaps another way

7

of addressing myself to the question of whether the case is moot

8

or whether it has lost its practical importance, because of the

9

intervening passage of the State law of Ohio, which Mr. Justice

10

11

Fortas referred to, or the Federal law or both the case recently
vindicated.
It is our view that these intervening events do not

13
14
15
16

17
!8
19
20
21

22
23
24

in any technical sense make this case moot, because they do not
provide the remedy sought by this particular plaintiff in this
case.
As Mr. Carter pointed out, the Ohio law does not read
a refusal to sell or rent a private dwelling.

It does reach

some discriminations by those engaged in lending or in adver­
tising or m furnishing commercial services with respect to the
sale of private housing.
But the fundamental complaint here, that certain
housing was unavailable to Mrs. Hunter is not a remedy which
she can obtain under the Ohio law.
As for the new Federal law, in 1968, it does not as
of now provide any remedy with respect to what I assume to be a

25
19

1

single family house which is what Mrs. Hunter was looking for.
Indeed, it is not clear whether the Federal law will

2
3

ever provide a remedy against the

kind of legislation

alleged

4

here by the realtor.

5

provide a remedy against a realtor who misrepresents the avail­

6

ability of certain housing to a particular race or class, but

7

if it correctly represents the owner's desire not to sell it

3

may not be a violation of the Federal Act.

Federal law does or will a year from now

The 1866 Act does cover the fundamental complaint

9
10

here in that it reaches all housing, indeed all property dis­

11

criminations on the ground of race.

25

What she

wants is that the Akron, Ohio Commission, the local commission,
easily accessible to her, on which sit local leaders, committed
by their local ordinance to eliminating racial discrimination
in housing in their community, shall act and shall investigate
and if necessary shall institute legal proceedings on her behalf
to vindicate her right which she has under Federal law as well
as under this local ordinance of Akron.
This is not an unimportant question.

24

But it does not furnish

The availability

of a local remedy even today when there is a Federal remedy is
important.
20

1

Q

Is that commission still in existence?

2

A

The commission as I understand it was never

3

fully activated, because this amendment to the Charter was

4

passed relatively rapidly after the original housing ordinance.

5

Q

There is no commission then?

A

I think that there xs no commission, certainly

by now there wouldn’t be one.

There has been a lot of talk about local handling of
local problems, and of course everyone would agree that that is
the most desirable and the most salutary way of handling this
and other problems in this area.

However, the commission is to be

courts sitting in the State of Ohio can afford the same effec­
tive relief as can a local commission administering this local
ordinance.
There is the involvement of local leaders, and the
local commitment of the inhabitants who have themselves passed
a supplementary law.

This is what the Federal Civil Rights Act

of 1968 envisaged, that there would be local laws, and local
23
24

remedies to supplement the Federal statute.
Also, a local commission is more readily accessible

25
21

1

2

to those who are injured.
It is also important that the local communities not

3

seem to be in conflict, with the overriding Federal law, which is

4

applied everywhere else, but the appearance of conflict which

5

results from Akron’s having a charter provision which says to

6

its City Council, "You may pass no law providing for fair

7

housing on the elimination of discrimination, when the Federal

8

law forbids such discrimination," it creates a confusion.

9

It seems to tell the citizens of that city that

10

whereas Washington is telling them they may not discriminate,

11

their own electorate is condoning it and I am only saying that

12

this makes it important and not moot.

13
14
15
16

Q

I don’t understand this argument at all.

The

Council has passed this legislation.
A

I should perhaps not have referred to leaders in

the sense of political leaders, but they had passed this Act.

17

Q

As an emergency ordinance?

13

A

But now nevertheless, the city as its charter,

19

its most authentic law provides, has put itself on the side of

20

perpetuating the regime of laissez faire, whereby freedom to

21

discriminate on any grounds and specifically on the ground of

22

race appears to be condoned.

23
24
25

That is not effective because there is a Federal law
which forbids it.
Q

I don’t understand how you can say it appears to

22

1

be condoned»

2

shall be subject to the most democratic process of them all,

3

not representative democracy but pure democracy»
A

4

The charter merely provides that any legislation

It is not as though there were no law»

Akron

5

has not been silent on the subject.

It has today in its organic

6

Charter a provision, the only amendment to the City Charter of

7

Akron as far as I can tell from the record which provides that

8

on this one subject alone, that is discrimination in housing

9

with respect to race, religion or ethnic origin — the City

10

Council is disabled from acting unless and until it obtains the

11

approval of the entire electorate.
Q

12

I am having a little difficulty, too, Mr.

13

Claiborne.

14

the constitutionality of a referendum by which the voters of

15
16
17
18
19
20
2?
22
23
24
25

I take it that you would not challenge, or would you,

Akron repealed these specific ordinances and did no more.
Would you say that that presents a substantial ques­
tion under the 14th Amendment?
A

Depending on the effect of such a referendum, I

think it would present a substantial question.

I should say

that there is a case pending in this court involving that
exact question, and it may be questionable whether I should
speak to that case rather than this one.
Q

What is that case?

A

That involves the city of Toledo, Ohio.

Q

As I understood Mr. Carter, he was presenting
23

?

this on a very different basis, and perhaps I misunderstand, but

2

I thought he was presenting this on the following basis, that

3

here is in substance an overriding law which says in Akron you

4

can pass any kind of housing legislation you want to by the

5

ordinary processes, but if it is housing legislation that re­

6

lates to the problem of racial discrimination you may not.

7

You must first submit that to the voters»

It is my

8

understanding of his argument that he says that that is a dis­

9

crimination on racial grounds without a permissible object and

10

it therefore violates the 14th Amendment, specifically the

11

equal protection clause.

13
14

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Is that your understanding of the argument?
A

It is not only my understanding of the argument,

but I entirely adopt it and approve it.

I was perhaps moving

too slowly and hadn't gotten that far.
Q

That would have no effect whatever, as I see it,

on the validity of a specific referendum designed, or which has
the effect of repealing a specific ordinance passed by the City
Council of Akron.

That argument it seems to me to be not

applicable because the referendum machinery is available with
respect to all ordinances.
Your case is

being presented to us on a very

different basis, that is to say the basis of singling out a
particular kind of housing legislation, namely legislation
directed to racial discrimination and saying as to that specific
24

1!

type of housing legislafcbn there must be a special procedure,

2

i.e., submission to the voters.

3

A

Perhaps I shouldn’t take on the referendum case.

4

I simply, to be candid in answer to your question, didn’t want

5

to suggest that there were no arguments available here which

6

wouldn't have some bearing on that case as well.

7

If the referendum has the effect, as a practical

3

matter, or as a legal matter, as is claimed in this other case,

9

of disabling the Council in the indefinite future from then

10

enacting any such fair housing ordinance, then the effect ixisofat

11

as placing a burden on the victims of discrimination in obtain-

i2

ing an effective remedy through the political process is exactly

13

the same whether it is done by a referendum disapproval of an

14

existing ordinance or whether it is done as here by an amendment

15

to the City Charter.

IS

It is debated in the other case whether the referendum

17

has this effect, and it does not appear in the case of Akron the

18

referendum, the disapproval of their ordinance by a referendum,

19

would have inhibited the Council from passing the ordinance at

20

a later time.

21

22
23
24

25

But there is also the other evidence which is that
disapproval of an ordinance by referendum merely erases, and it
does not put into the organic law what seems to be or what is
on its face a discriminatory provision, explicitly grounding in
race, and, of course, resort to the referendum as available with

25

respect to ali ordinances, and not quite all ordinances, in
the case of Akron, whereas here we have a tailor-made provision
dealing with only the subject of fair housing which is a plain
discrimination against the beneficiaries of such lav/s.
Q

I understand that instead of putting 137 to

initiative as they did, if they had put a repealer of the open
housing law by initiative, you are suggesting that you might
still be here under the equal protection clause, but you don't
have to reach that question in this case, is that right?
A

That is right, Mr. Justice Brennan, although I

think the recourse to this procedure, which is available in any
case, might have had an injurious effect, but that might be
just as bad because we cannot control the political process to
that extent.
Whereas here an instrument was fashioned with the
purpose of placing at a very substantial disadvantage or as
Professor Black has put it in his article, putting the life
preserver out of convenient reach.

That was the effect of this

amendment„
Q

Is that Toledo case raising the issue of putting

the original open housing ordinance to a referendum?
A

Yes.

Q

So this case would not decide that, necessarily?

A

Mot necessarily.

Now, I should point out and

the answer given was that any ordinance is subject to referendum

l

1

That is not quite true.

The Akron Charter expressly forbids

It is interesting that when it comes to those matters,
referendum is not permitted.
Q

I don't think it is fair to say that the moti­

vation behind that is that the people are not to be trusted,

11

and I don't think that you do, Mr. Claiborne, either.

some matters as to which vagaries of the referendum process •——
Q

The first area you gave involved the necessity

for promptness, and the second is a nonlegislative act?
A

Perhaps so.

our argument here.

Let me just emphasize the thrust of

It is that this amendment to the City

Charter has the undeniable effect of prejudicing the benefici­
aries of this type of legislation.
It also has the inevitable effect of encouraging or

21

at least permitting those who engage in this discrimination,

22

by assuring them that the likelihood of a passage of such an

23
24
25

ordinance is more remote than it was before, and that things
will remain as they are for a reasonable long time.
All of this might be beyond constitutional challenge
27

1

if it resulted from the normal political process.

Here it

2

results on the contrary from an action which narrows, and not

8

enlarges the avenues of political relief.

4

We do have here a clogging of the political process.

5

Normally legislation can be passed either by the Council or by

6

the process of initiative or by a combination of both through

7

the submission of referendum.

8
9

With respect to this one area, the Council is not to
be trusted, especially since they have demonstrated their

io

willingness to pass the fair housing legislation by a vote,

n

and therefore the avenue of relief normally available through

12

the elected representatives is no longer available and that has

13

been shut off.

14

The only way in which housing legislation can now be

15

enacted in Akron is through the cumbersome and quite unusual

16

procedure of either initiative as a practical matter, or

17

theoretically repassing of this ordinance and an automatic

18

referendum thereafter.

19

Q

20
21

22
23
24
25

You think or at least you suggest it is not a

sufficient reason to want the voice of the majority of the
people on something that they think is important?
h

We do not challenge or in any way question the

desirability of obtaining the approval or voice of the elec­
torate on any matter.

We do think that singling out this

particular matter indicates that this is not a feeling by the
28

1

citizenry of Akron that they ought to resort to pure democracy,

a

but rather a tailor-made device which happens to work, very well

3

because those who are affected are a minority, and their voice

4

will be more effecti^/ely ground out when the unabated rule of

5

the majority will prevail»

6

Q

This is just something that you really canst do?

7

A

I suggest that they can do it by initiative or

3

by referendum, but they cannot do it in this way.

This way does

9

carry with it both some consequences and a flavor which has

10

practical impact, this being an area where neutrality is made

11

unless the city is to go forward with and eliminate discrimi­

12

nation.
It has but two choices, to combat discrimination or

13

15
16

remain scrupulously neutral with respect to it.

difficult to do and yet speak on the subject, to remain scrupu­
lously neutral and not go in the other direction.
It seems to us here that Akron has said too much to

17
13

be properly characterized as neutral.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALVIN C. VINOPAL, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. VINOPALs

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

court,, our position here has three phases.
I am briefly going to touch on the subject of moot­

5
6

ness » and then I am going to talk about where we stand with

7

respect to Reitman, and then I intend to talk some about

8

classification.
Now, with respect to mootness, it seems to me, to

9
10

start with, that unless my friends on the other side feel that

11

the people of Akron will refuse to obey the State or Federal

12

law, if that is their argument then perhaps we shouldn’t be here

13

at all.

14
15
16

\1
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

But I don’t think Akron are that kind of people.

They

will obey the State and Federal law.
Now, as to this particular specific complaint, both
the State and the Federal law do cover it, because if you will
observe my appendix B in my brief, this is a complaint relating
to the activities of a real estate agent, and that is covered
or that proposition is covered by both of the laws.
That was really the basic purpose, in a sense as I
see it, for the State and Federal law.

Along that line I began

thinking about it and I looked in the Sunday classification ads,
just the Sunday before I came down here, as to advertisements
with respect to the sale and rental of real estate, and I was
30

amazed to find that of some close to 500 listings, 448 of them
were listings by real estate people and only 15 or 20 were
listings by individuals.
In ray own observation, in my travels through the City
of Akron, I have yet to see a sign like it used to be, he wants
to sell his house.
This relates to the regulation of a vast business,
namely the real estate business as well as the banking business
in certain areas as I will come to them.
Now the other aspect of the question of the mootness
here is that Nellie Hunter anyway would hardly be involved in
this complaint because she is now living in Chicago.

The other

aspect about the fact that we have the State and the Federal law
as well as the Jones doctrine, under the State and Federal Act
the ultimate complaint of a Commission, whatever it may be,
ultimately ends up in the Common Pleas Court of the county where
the individuals are located.
If they have the State law, the State will take over,
or the city can take over.
Q

Does the record before us show that Mrs. Hunter

lives now in Chicago?
A

I will grant you, it doesn’t show that.

I am

referring to a newspaper article about the subject in discussing
with counsel, it isn't in the record, I will say that.
recent newspaper article on this subject covers that.
31

But a

1

2

Q

I have problems about that, about going outside

of the record on something of that sort.

3

A

I am sorry, I didn't mean —-

4

Q

You are in distinguished company, including five

5

Justices of this court yesterday»

6

tion, it was pointed'out that the person had moved away from

7

Arkansas,
A

8
9

counsel»

In a very analogous situa­

I have no intention to offend the court or

I notice

that in this area, courts have very little

10

record to come up here and there are a lot of assumptions made

11

about what was before the court»

12

Another aspect of mootness is, too, that Akron is

13

surrounded by what we would call five or six bedroom communities

34

which really have no law on the subject and these real estate

15

people, I suppose — this court certainly, I would assume and 1

16

hope the court would assume that these real estate dealers

17

involved in a vast metropolitan area like that hive offices

18

and in fact they do in just those separate communities, and

19

their activities relate to properties only in those communities,

20

and the Akron law wouldn't cover that subject at all.

21

As a side issue as to why I think that really the

22

place for this type of law is with the State is that again

23

really, this is a real estate business.

24
25

The activity is that.

If you will observe the ordinance and even the State Act, any
person to whom an application is made for financial assistance
32

1

for the acquisition* construction, rehabilitation, repair or

2

maintenance of any housing ~~ that certainly is a subject which

3

is a regulatory matter involving real estate people and banking

4

people and where real estate people and banking people are

3

regulated by State law I think that the State law is the place

6

for this particular type of regulatory law.

7

The State law does cover the activities of real

8

estate agents and in fact the matter I am coming to now deals

9

specifically with that.

10

I want to talk about the Reitman theory, and the

11

background in this particular case.

12

Fortas, I want to be fair here in the record, talking about

13

background I am referring to a document which my adversaries

14

have quoted in both of their briefs, discrimination in housing

15

in Ohio, and I am sure the courts of the State of Ohio must have

I 16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

Now again, Mr. Justice

had this before them, although there is nothing in any of the
opinions relating to it.
But discrimination in Ohio is a subject which got
State-wide because of this report of the Civil Rights Commission
That was in January of 1963.
Then a bill was introduced about a month after that
in 1963, and that bill died as the saying goes in June of 1963.
It was indefinitely postponed.

But all along, I feel the

environment was that the State was talking about fair housing
and discrimination in Ohio.
33

So the next thing that happened, we come along then

1

2

to July of 1964, and Akron then passed the Fair Housing

3

Ordinance.

4

commencing in 1963, the case of Porter versus Oberlin, which

5

is cited in one of the briefs here, wherein the City of Oberlin

6

had a fair* housing ordinance and it was attacked as being

7

unconstitutional, and in fact the State Court of Ohio did

8

declare that particular ordinance to be unconstitutional, the

9

enforcement portion of it, stating that here was the attempt

But prior to that there was in the courts of

Ohio

10

of a municipality to set up in a sense a court, and that courts

11

only could be created, particularly municipal courts, by the

12

General Legislature of the State of Ohio.

13

Therefore, since this Commission was doing something

14

in the nature of the judicial function it was unconstitutional.

15

I do want to say in fairness that when the matter came up in

16

17
18
19
20

2!
22
23
24
25

our case, the Akron case, the status of it was raised again,
and in the Akron case the Judge who wrote the opinion in one
of our cases which was before them, said that the Akron
officials had no standing to appeal that case, and then several
of the judges said, well, in view of the fact that this court
has formerly held that the enforcement section of the Fair
Housing Ordinance was unconstitutional, we would have to go
along with that.
But now that the constituency of the court had
changed we probably wouldn’t do it.
34

But the judgment in that

court only stood for the fact that the City of Akron's officials
could not challenge the constitutional question.
Q

Was that when they decided to pass 137?

A

That wasn't decided, your Honor, until March of

1965, so we passed 137 in August of 1964, within 25 days after
the Fair Housing Case went on.
Q

Why was it passed?

A

Well, my own judgment as to why I think it was

passed, is first of all, we start with the proposition that
we don’t have to have fair housing ordinances in Akron? that is
No. 1.
Q

Wasn't the subject to initiative and referendum,

the original fair housing ordinance?
A

The Fair Housing Ordinance was passed as an

emergency ordinance.
Q

It had to be attacked by initiative.

You could attack it by initiative which would be

a little bit difficult, or you could amend the Charter, which
wouldn’t be difficult, and so you took
A

the

easy way?

Well, in a sense 1 think that we benefited the

proponents of fair housing, and I will come to that.

Now the

initiative would be to start a new law or repeal the law.
Q

Why is she here complaining, then?

A

It benefited here in the political processes that

were involved in this particular activity, that is what I mean.
I will come to that.
35

1

Q

Could I ask you before you go to another point,

2

is the affidavit referred to in the complaint which appellant

3

filed with the Commission, of the Mayor and members of the

4

Commission?

5

A

That is in the record.

7

Q

I haven't yet been able to locate it,,

8

A

By the way, there are one or two sections of the

6

9

It is in the original

record.

Charter which I intend to refer to which are not in the printed

10

record, but they are in the original record, copies of which

11

were furnished to the State court by your office.

12

IIS

Then we come along to 1964 when the Pair Housing
Ordinance was passed and the Charter Amendment.

Immediately

14

right thereafter, of course the initiative at that time would

15

have required naturally 10 percent of the voters to initiate

16

repeal of Fair Housing but they chose the other.

17
118
19

20
2?
22
23
24
25

Q

And that took 7 percent to put it on the ballot?

A

No.

We have a procedure where the council put

it on the ballot, and it wasn't required to put this Charter
Amendment on the ballot at all.
Q

The Council did?

A

Yes.

By Section 136, Council is permitted to

put all ordinances or any Charter Amendment which they desire
on the ballot themselves.
Q

Just so that I may understand what happened here,
36

1

the Council enacted the Pair Housing Ordinance, and a few weeks

2

later an amendment thereto, and then you are telling us that

3

they passed it as an emergency ordinance, and then you are

4

saying that the Council thereafter submitted to the voters

5

Section 137 as an amendment to the Akron City Charter?

7

I am sorry, no.

amend the Charter as an
Q

3

There was this petition to

initiative petition*

And what percentage of the registered voters

were required?
10

A

Seven percent.

11

Q

Was the population of Akron, and what is the

12
|

average number of registered voters in an election?
A

13
14

The county vote is 200,000, and I think the

city vote is somewhere around 150,000 to 170,000.

13

Q

16

A

Yes, sir.

Q

What percentage of the population is Negro,

17
13

approximately?
A

1

22
23
24
25

I think that we have 11 percent.
Then we come along to January of 1 65, at which

20
21

The population is around 300,000?

time Miss Hunter filed this complaint.

Following that, there

had been again activity instituted in the State Legislature
where

by March of 1 65 the State Fair Housing Bill was enacted,

and I think just as a casual personal observation as to why it
didn't get enacted in '63 was that it was hastily done after
3?

1

this report, and someone wanted to put it in with health,

2

welfare and morals, and that part of the code and it was all

3

botched up and it came back the next time the legislature met

4

and they passed it quite readily under the Civil Rights

5

Commission section.
So as I say, as to what environment was and the back­

6
7

ground was of Fair Housing, it was really around the time that

8

this took place, namely that it was already started in the

9

State and I would presume someone must have felt that after all

10

perhaps the place to regulate this thing would be State-wide,

11

and first we don’t have to have one in Akron.
There must be someplace where you could maintain that

12

13

particular position, it would seem to me.
Now as to what the impact of this particular amend­

14

15
13

17
18
19
20

ment had for instance on Mrs. Hunter, it seems to me although
I don’t want to be unfair in mentioning where she resides, but
as to others generally the only time that there would have been
any possibility that their rights were infringed would be
from the period of July of 1964 until October of 1965, when
we had the State law.
We then had a State law covering pretty much the

21

22
23
24
25

subject.
Q

1 am really troubled because there seems to be

a difference of opinion between you and Mr. Carter as to whether
the State law does cover this.

I haven’t yet been able to find
38

3

rental of private property between "A" and "B".

5

A

I am troubled by that difference,

On page 13 of my brief I have it set out.

I do

9

Q

Does the State law cover this complaint?

10

A

Yes, in my opinion it certainly does.

11

Q

What section of the State law is that?

12

A

That would be Section under 41, 1202, page 11 of .

13

my brief.

14

relating to the sale or transfer and so forth, of personal

IS

residence.

16

seems to me, relates to the regulation of the activities of real

I don't see anything about printing or circu­

lating such things.
A

21

The whole tenor of that portion of the Act, it

estate people, those dealing in this business.

18
19

There is the Section 6, to circulate any statement

Well, the complaint, as I gathered, it was

I
circulated and implied that there were certain properties for
sale and when it came time to show them to this lady they were
not shown.
Q

Would I be safe in saying that there is a

question as to whether or not

the State law covers this?
39

1

1

A

I am not doubtful about it.

If it was a com­

2

plaint about someone who refused to sell their house, it would

3

be serious.

4

Q

It is covered by the State law, you say?

5

A

I think it is.

6

Q

Do you think there is some question that it is

7

not covered by the State law?
A

8

S

No, I do not.

Do you recognise that?
I think that these particular

paragraphs are sufficient to cover that particular complaint.

10

Q

Did the State courts say it covered it?

11

A

The State court only dealt with the problem of

12

whether or not this was a regulation, and the State court or

n

the people of Akron had the right to vote it.

u
15

Q

this statute covers this problem?
A

16
17

IS

Isn't it a matter of State law whether or not

never v/as

Yes.

In this case the question of that problem

raised.
Q

But there is no question that the complaint

i

19

could come before the Commission, if the Commission had been in

20

existence, and if 137 had not been adopted?

21

A

That is right.

22

Q

There is no question about that?

23

A

That is right.

24

Q

And the Commission, since you say there is such

25

a wonderful atmosphere in Akron, couldn't the Commission talk
40

1

to the realtor and explain that you shouldn’t treat this woman

2

this way,, and to be nice to her^ than it could do all of those

3

things.

But it couldn’t be settled once 137 was passed?

4

A

That is right.

5

Q

And you say you still have the same situation,

6

by taking away one of the avenues to help her?
A

7

Well, on the basis of the fact that we did not

8

have to have a fair housing ordinance, but we had remedies by

9

the State law and now the Federal law.
At the time, of course, that she filed a complaint

30
11

there was no Federal law, of course.

But there was the Federal

12

law with respect to the private individuals and sale of the

13

property, and there was no remedy.
What I am coming to is that the situation was a benefi t

14
13

in this respect as to the matter of the burdens that are placed

IS

upon people in this particular situation.
Q

17
18

Before you go on to that, may I see if I can

clear this up in my own mind anyway.
If Mr. Jones, a resident of Akron owns a one family

19
20

house and he has that on the market for sale and he refuses to

21

sell it to Mrs. Hunter because she is a Negro, that would not

22

violate the State lav?, would it?

23

in subparagraph 1 "Refuse to Sell," makes it an unlawful.dis­

24

criminatory practice to refuse to sell on account of race and

25

Section 4112.02, on page 10

so on.
41

1

That applies only to commercial housing, does it not?

2

A

Yes, sir.

3

Q

And it would not affect this situation?

4

A

No.

5

Q

Now, I fail to see anything else in the State

6

law, and 1 may be wrong, but I fail to see anything else in

?

the State law that reaches the case I just put to you.

8

A

Yes, but that isn't the case that we have here.

9

Q

Now then you turn to page 13 of your brief, and

10

you loolc at the affidavit that I have been searching for, and

11

in that affidavit, according to the affidavit, the agent stated

12

to Mrs. Hunter that she could not show me any of the houses on

13

the list because all of the owners had specified that they did

14

not wish their houses shown to Negroes.

I 15

So that it is at least arguable that Mrs. Hunter, the

16

gravamen of Mrs. Hunter's complaint here is that the owners of

17

individual houses, and not commercial property, but individual

18

houses, refused to sell to her.

19

the State law?

20

A

That would not be covered by

Merely on the basis of a statement from some

21

real estate agent, it would be arguable, but not in her specific

22

private dealing with any private .individual.

23
24
25

Q

I think that I have the line of reasoning

straightened out anyway; thank you.
A

I had gotten to the question here of what barriers
42

;

1

are placed in the path of these people who want this particular

2

ordinance, and I have read a stack of cases this high, and

3

right now 1 would say that they are all piled on the floor of

4

ray mind and I couldn't sort any of them out and tell which one

5

of them ought to be catalogued.

6

But I drafted a little statement here which I thought

7

was in a sense the rule that would apply here as to whether or

3

not there had been unreasonable barriers placed in the way for

9

these people to accomplish what they want,

ID
1?

I think that we go back basically to the proposition
that d:his really is a political duel or a political competition.

12

Someone wanted fair housing and someone didn't want fair

13

housing.

14

want a certain regulation, and between those who oppose it, if

13

the State or the city in this particular case may not place in

16

the way of those who desire it, any barriers which within the

17

State or city's total political system taken as a whole, any

18

barriers which are especially difficult of surmounting by

19

comparison with those barriers that normally stand in the way

20

of those who wish to use the political process to get what they

2!

want.

As I see it, in a political duel between those who

22

Now in coming to the answer ---

23

Q

Would you amend your hypothesis there to the

24

extent of saying that this was a political combat between those

23

who wanted to protect their constitutional rights and those who

43

1

wanted to deny them to them, and could you proceed from that to

2

get the same result?
A

3

Well, I would say that I would have to grant

4

certainly those people have the right to their constitutional

5

rights, and it would have to fit in whatever process the city

S

or the State evolved and there would

7

are allowed and permitted under the Federal Constitution.
Of course, that would be basic in this assumption

8
9

have to be rights that

here.

So I say that the fact about the way this particular

10

Charter Amendment ended up was that it is easier for those who

11

desire to get fair housing with it than it was before, because

12

X am sure that this court can conceive, and I certainly do have

13

city councils, right in my own area, who wouldn't pass fair

14

housing.

15

IS
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

So, therefore, what are they going to have to do?
They are going to have to get it referred, those who would want
to have it eliminated, they would have to use the process of
referendum.
Q

But we already had fair housing in Akron?

A

No, we do not have.

Q

X say at this time we already had it.

A

No, because the Circuit Court of Ohio says we did

not, because it was suspended, and there was no fair housing law
Q

Up until it was suspended, you did have it, and

so you helped by taking it away.

That is where you lose me.
44

A

Well, until the ordinance became effective, it

seems to me that we wouldn't have it»
Q

Well, I can also assume that the ordinance would

become effective»
A

Getting back to the total procedures which are

necessary -Q

What more was accomplished under your argument,

that Akron saved money with this Commission, and what else did
you save for Akron?
A

Because I think that the State Commission is far

better equipped to handle a complaint,
Q

Is it in operation now?

A

Yes, it is in operation now, and real estate

people are regulated by the State.
Q

And would it have handled this complaint?

A

Oh, yes, it would be my assumption.

Q

I would feel much better if I was an ordinary

citizen, if I had three protections than if I had two.
A

Well, there are those who feel that we have too

many laws overlapping as they are, and my own judgment is that
since this is a total problem that we ought to regulate State­
wide, and it ought to be done that way, because as I have just
said, there are many of us, municipalities in Ohio who will
never have one, in my own humble judgment.
Q

Is it your opinion that the State law pre-empts
45

this whole situation?
A

Well, the State is now in there, and I am sure

if Akron tried to do anything that the State found offensive
to the way it was handling it, it would be held improper»

I

think cities are allowed to have laws which are not in conflict
with general law, and so if it didn't disturb what the State
had, it would be no problem,
Q

It is not your position that the State law re­

places it, because it is a matter of Ohio law that doesn't
happen.

Any city, any home-rule city can have an ordinance so

long as it is not in conflict with State law, and then neither
one or the other supersedes or pre-empts the other.

Each is

a viable and separate lav/, isn't that correct?
A

Yes.

Q

Is it your position that the relief provided in

this case is now provided by State law?
A

There is a State law which provides relief that

she couldn't have.
Q

This was a mandamous case,

Sven so, I still can’t see how that enables this

court to escape the determination on the constitutional question
which has been presented,

I gather that is the whole gist of

your argument, isn't it?
A

Yes, that is the one point, the one phase of it,

but if this party had other remedies, it seems to me it would
be a moot question.
46

1

To get back

2

to Justice Marshall? anyone starting from scratch? if I may use

3

that word? who would want fair housing? would have to take? if

4

they found an unfriendly council? they would have to take it to

5

referendum.

6

Now that is not necessary.

Under the procedure now?

7

the council may at any time put this fair housing ordinance

8

before the people? and so therefore --

9

Q

These other communities are not before us? and

10

the only community is Akron.

11

and that is the case we are deciding.

12
I 13

i

Of course? we now have the Federal law.

14
15
10

Akron had a fair housing ordinance?

Now? if you made it easier for Cleveland or any of
the other cities? that wouldn’t affect Akron? as I see it.
A

The Supreme Court of Ohio made this statement on

this subject, which is on page 50 of the records
"It is obvious? therefore, that if Section 137 of

17

the Akron Charter is valid? its words require the conclusion

13

that the ordinance relied upon had ceased to be effective?

19

immediately that ordinance was in effect when the Charter

20

section was adopted and the ordinance has never been approved

21

by the electorate."

22

So in a sense? for the 25 days ——

23

Q

24
23

As I read it? it states that Section 137 is out?

and that is the point that is before this court now? whether
it is valid or not.

Isn't that the issue?
47

A

Yes o

Of course, we contend it is valid because it sets up
no particular extra unusual burdens.

The classification in

order to be obnoxious must be arbitrary and have no reasonable
basis.
Certainly, if the people want to refer or have re­
ferred to the question of fair housing, it would not seem to be
unreasonable, in view of the environment which existed at the
time.
Namely, that there waspending in the State the activity
of having a State law, that possibly the enforcement provisions
of a city ordinance may net have been effective anyway, and in
view of those things and in view of the fact that it is not
necessary to haveone, this was the first opportunity there 1
would say that the people could have to decide whether they
wanted one or not, since the council had elected to pass the
ordinance the way they did.
So, in view of ail of those things I don't think it
is unreasonable at all that they should desire to do it this
way.
So really all that has to be done now is to have
council bring it to the voters, saving anyone who wanted to
have fair housing the obligation and the need for getting the
referendum and petition, granting as the Justice said that for
25 days there was a law but nothing had ever happened and the
48

commission never got organized.

Everyone conceded at the time

that they were waiting to see what was going to start in rela­
tion to whether there would be a State lav;.
I will grant you that maybe one of the things, but
taking overall, the environment was favorable to those who
wanted to do it this way in my humble judgment.
As to other barriers, council has spoken of the tax
ordinance.

That was one of their chief complaints, that these

people had heavier burdens and this ordinance was singled out.
It wasn't, as indicated here, and also there is
another one which is not in my brief and I regret in preparing
for this case, being my first trip over the road, I perhaps may
not have done what I should have, namely with respect to where
Mrs. Hunter now resides and with respect to another Charter
provision.
That is section 39 regarding franchises, and it says
this5

"If anyone wants a franchise for a public utility, every

such proposed grant and every proposed renewal or extension of
such grant by ordinance passed by the council shall be subject
to referendum."
Is there anyone who wants to have some sort of fran­
chise stand the risk right off the bat of having the people vote
on the subject.

If they want to circulate petitions for that

purpose, they can do so.
Q

Wouldn't you assume that a utility is in better
49

1
2

shape financially to get a referendum than a property owner?
A

Well, some of them are, but some I have dealt

3

with, a little fellow with a bus line who I helped get a fran­

4

chise from the city, xvas practically bankrupt.

5

even he would be better off,

! 6

Q

But I would say

I agree,

Perhaps it is arguable that this case is being

7

more like the public utility charter provision if the latter

&

said that the utility charters may be issued to white people

2

without a referendum and it could be issued to Negroes and you

10

11

would have to have a referendum.
As I understand the adversary8s argument, he is

12

pitching his case on that narrow point of alleged racial dis­

13

crimination.

14

provision adopted here had said that all ordinances regulating

15

terms, conditions and manner and so on of sale of real estate

16

have to be submitted to the voters, then the same line of

17
18
19
20

2!
22

23
24
25

As I understand this case, if for example the

argument would not apply.
That is my understanding of his argument.

That is

why I put to you the alternative case with respect to utility
franchises„
A

Well, of course, granting this is the element of

the racial discrimination, but in a sense this was an ordinance
dealing with the regulation of a subject, and, of course, one
of the subjects was the sale of housing, whether it was to
Negroes or whatever classification of people it was.
50

It covered

3

namely the subject of the sale and the rental of property»

2

that sense I think people definitely have had a right to

3

consider like they had done in other situations in their

4

Charter , and have it referred to them fox- the purpose of whether

3

they wanted it or not»

In

6

That is not merely because they ought to go slow in

7

this area, but because of the other issues, that it was still

8

going through the State courts and it was still being looked

9

into by the State Legislature, and also by virtue of the fact

10

that really if we are going to regulate this thing and do it

II

right, possibly it should be done with the State because really

12

in the area that we are dealing with here it is a subject in™

13

volving real estate people, the way they handle this business,

14

and as I pointed out that is the basis of it.
There are few transactions between private people

15
16

and I think that that is a nullity anyway.
Q

Why do you assume that we have to go slow in

19

A

My statement was that ---

20

Q

17
18

21

22
23
24
25

this area?

I understood you to say just a moment ago, that

because it was necessary to go slow in this area.
A

I didn't speak loudly enough.

I said regardless

of that, I made that an exception to my statement.
My

position is that the need to go slow is not an

element hereas to why the people would want to have

51

this.

I

don't consider that really vital to the matter.

I think the

basic interests that I have talked about, are important.

That

is that it is a big subject that we are going to get into, and,
of course, I can't go off the record but I had understood that
real estate people were really the ones who were in favor of
having the act in the State, and having it where it could be
regulated, and since we are getting into a vast subject of
dealings with transactions involving financing and sale and the
mortgaging interest and all of those things, and property.
I will conclude.
Q

Could I ask you a question, please.

Didn't the ordinance do two things?

It said that a

certain kind of ordinance can't be effective without the vote
■

of the people.

That is one thing it did?

A

Yes.

Q

But then it also said that a particular ordinance

that is on the books is suspended?
1

A

Yes.

Q

Don't you think there is a separate question

involved here whether a city may just repeal an ordinance
because this Charter at least did that?

It may have gone

farther and did something that is arguably impermissible.

But

didn't it repeal an existing ordinance?
A

Yes, it did that.

Q

Don’t we have to hold therefore that the city
52

]

may not — for you to lose, don’t we have to hold that a city

2 may not repeal an ordinance?
A

3

Yes, but I think that a city can, because there

4 are procedures and machinery which has been adopted„
S

Q

6

might make.

7

A

8

I am suggesting that that is an argument that you

There are several arguments that I will think

about tonight.
I am going to close with this, that the iceberg under

9
10

this which I presented here is pretty large.

11

that we don’t need a hatchet operation here, that after all we

12

do have machinery that is taking care of this problem by virtue

13

of State and Federal law and the 1869 Act, and therefore we

14

ought to do something now which would amputate the whole

15

16

Governmental machinery, and the process of initiative and
referendum which is really structured for the local communities.
That is another argument I should have made.

17
18
19
20

all, this is only local, and many did touch on theit.
State-wide, and this doesn't cover everybody.

This isn’t

This is just

So my final word is that we shouldn’t burn down the
barn to roast the pig.

I think that I should close on that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. CARTER, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. CARTER;

| 3

On the question of the repeal I think in

4

terms of answering it, it seems to me that Akron has done more

5

than repeal the ordinance.

o

things.

7

Q

It has done that plus some other

I think there are two sentences there.

What you

8

are particularly concerned with is that second sentence, that

9

it shall cease to be effective until there is a referendum?

10

A

That is right.

1!

Q

If I understood your argument, you have been

13
14
15
16
17
18
1D

20
21
22
2;
24
25

arguing about the first sentence, that you may not single out
a housing discrimination and ordinance stating that it must be
submitted to the electorate.

That has been the import of the

argument, I thought.
A
are two bases.

I think as a matter of fact, what we have here
As you indicated, the ordinance did two things.

The amendment tried to do two things.

It says that the Fair

Housing Ordinance which you have on the statute books is not
going to go into effect and it is suspended pending a vote of
the people.
It said secondly, that no Fair Housing can be passed
or Fair Housing Ordinance can be passed except by this process.
Now it seems to me -- Q

You are now arguing about the latter part, of it?
54

1

A

1

The latter aspect of it» I have been arguing
'

2

about both of them, because I think that is the question that
j

3

Mr, Justice Stewart asked,
Mr. Justice Stewart said to me, would I have to make

4
5

an argument about this if the statute had not been on the books

6

and

7

history of fair housing, and I said, of course 1 could.

8
9

!

couldn't I make the same argument here without any prior

Q

You couldn't have had quite the same lawsuit but

you would have exactly the same constitutional argument?

10

A

I think so,

11

Q

I agree that you would, and that is why I say

12

that is the burden of your argument, is the singling out of

13

this kind of an ordinance for special treatment, but you still

14

have to say that in the process of putting on this kind of

I 15

15
17
13
13

20
21

22
23
24
25

provision that the State may not repeal an existing ordinance.
Do we have to decide to hold for you that a State may
not repeal an existing ordinance?
A

You don't have to decide that the State may not.

repeal an existing ordinance.
Q

I mean an existing Fair Housing Ordinance?

A

I don't think that you have to.

Q

Why not?

A

Because I think that what you have to decide,

it seems to me —Q

Because that is one thing the State did here?
55

1
!2
!

A

That is one thing the State did here, but the

State did more than that.

3

Q

Why do we have to get to the more?

4

A

Because of the fact, that if the State would have

5

done more, it seems as far as my argument is concerned that it

8

is a simpler constitutional question to indicate that the State

! 7

cannot single out these people and bar any legislation.

8

Q

Let me ask you this, Mr. Carter.

9

Suppose the Court decided that the first sentence of

10

this ordinance was unconstitutional and stopped.

11

the first sentence is unconstitutional, but it was perfectly

12

constitutional for the State to repeal this ordinance, so there

13

is no ordinance in effect in Akron.

14

Or it said

But the provision singling out fair housing ordinances

13

as those which must go to a referendum or initiative is uncon-

18

stitutional.

Would that satisfy you or not?

17

A

Well, it would appear to me —--

18

Q

In short, what is this case about?

19

A

This case is about the fact that the ordinances

20
21

22
23
24
25

of this kind singled out a particular class of legislation and
said you may not do this without going to a referendum.
Q

Let us assume the Court agreed with you on that.

A

The State has done more, Mr. Justice White, and

it repealed the ordinance.
Q

Do you want us to say that the repealer is also
56

unconstitutional?
A

I want you to say that the repeal is unconsti­

tutional with the burden which has been put upon us at the
present time.
Q

We can say the burdens are unconstitutional, but

why does that make your repealer unconstitutional?
A

If you say the burdens are unconstitutional, it

seems to me that the issue as to whether a simple repeal is
unconstitutional is not my case.
Q

You want us to reach the existing ordinance?

A

That is right.

As far as we are concerned, your

Honor, our view is that we are here feeling that this ordinance
ought to be struck down for the reasons that have been
indicated.
(Whereupon, at 11:50 a.m. the hearing in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.)
