ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W. TESSMER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. TESSMER:

8

I am Charles Tessmer of Dallas, Texas.

9

I represent Reyes Orosco, the Petitioner, who stands convicted

10

of murder upon circumstantial evidence by a jury in a criminal

n

District Court of Dallas County Texas, with a penalty assist

12

that penal servitude of ten years.
This ±3 a classic case, presenting a violation of

13
14

the Petitioner's rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth

15

Amendments of the Constitution.

t

In this case the Petitioner was the prime murder

16
17

suspect, had been so for four hours.

At the time of his

18

interrogation he was under arrest, whether legal or not is not

19

important.
He was surrounded in his bedroom by four armed

20
21

officers.

22

the officers entered without his invitation or consent.

23

He was either asleep or had just been awakened when

In this case no new trails in the criminal law neesd

24

What we have here is a simple refusal of the Texas

The de-

ceased was found dead at around midnight or 12;30 by a uniformed
policeman.

A crowd had

gathered.

He was slumped over the wheel

of a car at a cafe.
After some investigation the detectives learned that
there was a possible eye witness named Miramontes»

The police

found Miramontes, arrested him, took him downtown to point out
where a woman had been let out of the car who was present at
the scene also.
Then they had Miramontes direct them to Lemon Avenue,
some two or three miles from the center of the city of Dallas.
And there Miramontes pointed out the house where his friend,

17
the Petitioner, lived and the car that he was in that night.
18
19

20

Then the officers proceeded back downtown, put
Miramontes in jail for investigation of murder and then after
this belated attempt of

some four hours, went back to the

21

house with three other officers.

An uninvited entry was made,

22
except there was an invitation by an unidentified woman, and,
23
of course, no consent there under Amos, Stover versus California 9

minute the Detective Brown got into that house, he admitted

not.

I don't contend that it is illegal because the

At any rate, we find the produce of that inter­

of a murder, the admission he owned a gun.

in a jail or in a police station?

surely in jail at that moment when ——

Q

But he was in bed in his own home»

6

A

But he was surrounded by four officers at 4;30

7

in the morning who had known about him for four hours»

Ande

8

further, they had time to take a man back to jail, come back,

9

no warrant»

They really didn’t believe he was going to escape

10

or they ^ould have gone in that house when it was first pointed

11

out,
But, be that as it may, here unless Miranda is to be

12

13

meaningful, and unless it applies to this situation where the

14

man is clearly under arrest, the police could delay taking him

15

to the stationhouse, and say, "Wall, he is in his own home and

16

we can question him there without the warnings" and thereby keep

17
18

him ignorant of his Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights
under the Constitution»
I think this Court would agree with me that these

19
20
21

22

rights belong to the guilty as surely as to the innocent, as
to the illiterate, the naive and to the organised criminal,
who knows his rights and doesn’t need them explained»
Q

23
24
25

Your position is that the police should have

done — that the Constitution required that the police do what
under —
9

!

A

That, they caution him of his right to counsel.

2

Q

And send for a lawyer for him?

3

A

Or, further,, that he need answer no questions

5

Q

Or arrest him.

6

A

Or take him to the police station after they

4

7

had arrested him instead of proceeding with the interrogation

8

of —-

9

Q

What if he had said, "My name is John Smith?"

10

Q

And, "That 1 wasn’t at the scene of the crime.8’

11

A

Well, then you would have an exculpatory

12

statement which if it later turned out to be true would be

13

as damaging against, him at his trial as if he said. I am guilty,

14

probably more

so.

15

Q

Well, they might not have ever arrested him?

16

Q

No.

17

A

This is true, but with an eye-witness who had

18
19
20

described his car sitting in the drive-way
0

And it might have been that he wasn’t at the

scene of the crime.

21

A

This is true,

I concede that.

22

Q

They should take him to the police station anyway?

23

A

Well, your Honor, all 1 can say that once he

24

said what his name was, away he went, and further they thought

25

enough about him to return t-wice to the scene, to order
10

1

additional assistance, a squad of armed police officers to

2

help with the arrest»

3

under arrest.
Q

4
5

They had made up their mind to take him

Well, you say he was just suspected of having

killed a man in cold blood, wasn't he?

6

A

Yes,

7

Q

It is not unreasonable to ask for a little

8

No question about that.

additional help when you are arresting somebody like that.
A

9

No question about their knowing that they claimed

10

to use any admissions he made as damaging evidence at his

11

trial.

12

Court I believe said quite lucidly in Miranda that, or in

13

Escobedo that if he is deprived of his freedom of movement in

14

any substantial way, then the cautions must be given whether he

15

be in the county jail, in his house or in a taxicab where he is

16

being questioned, or in a squad car on the way down town, unless

17

some valid exception, such as a threshold statement, a res

18

gestae, which this is four hours later questions no spontan­

19

eity there.

20

Now I point this out to this Honorable. Court that this

I think Professor Wigg would agree more that this

21

wasn't any res gestae.

22

doesn't argue that at all.

23
24
25

The Government of the State of Texas

Now I would like to point out further that the State
of Texas simply argues this in their brief.
all they could argue.

And I think it is

That he was in familiar circumstances
11

i

or surroundings at the time he was interrogated.

2

familiar, a boarding house at 4s30 in the morning, four armed

3

officers around his bed and he has just been awakened from sleep

4

Hardly a familiar place not subject to police domination.

S

Were they

I can concede or think believe that the police

6

station would be less dominating than your own bedroom under

7

those circumstances at 4;30 in the morning, surrounded by four

8

armed officers, no cautions, no warnings, nothing.

9

I think that is the State of Texas' main argument,

1©

can believe they wish to elucidate and use the doctrine of

11

fictitious waiver that although Mr, Barkley, the trial counsel

12

objected and objected and asked for voir dire, that he didn't

13

draw the Trial Judge a motion picture of Miranda,

14

I

Now in answer to that I would point out that we have

15

had, since Miranda, and since it became effective, two statutes

16

in the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure that go further than

17

Miranda and require more warnings.

18

They are namely Article 15,17 and Article 38,22?

19

15,17 requires that he be taken before a magistrate as soon as

2©

possible, and there given the cautions.

21

admissible admission or statement may be used,

22
23
24
25

Then a constitutionally

Article 38,22 provides that the officer who takes a
statement must repeat and give the same warning and they go
beyond Miranda so there is no argument that can reasonably be
made that the Trial Judge didn't know what. Mr, Barkley was
12

%

talking about»

2

Miranda and these statutes»

I think he presumed to know the import of

3

Now, what do I mean by fictitious waiver argument?

4

Many decisions in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit

5

have applied the doctrine and refused to accept it to racial

6

discrimination in the selection of juries»
Most States require that you make the motion before­

7
&

hand, before you select the jury to quash it and put in

9

evidence.

10

Numerous decisions hold that it may be made as late

as on appeal.

You have here a constitutional right, a const!•

11

tutional violation and, therefore, State procedural grounds

12

may not wash out that right even though it is admirable to have

13

State criminal, process? move quickly.

14

But where you have justice on one side and consti­

15

tutional rights of this magnitude and on the other the question

16

of whether you timely objected or you were just a little lata

17

or you didn’t draw a motion picture of the objection, I think

18

the decision in O'Conner versus Ohio is recognized and the

19

constitutional right may not be waived on that basis.

20

E

.

Also in the decision of Fahey versus Connecticut

21

where there was a violation of the Petitioner's Fourth

22

Amendment rights and he took the stand and admitted certain

23

things, still the finding of the paint in the garage where he

24

had marked the Swastifea on the synagogue was a right he could

*

25

complain about.
13

1

Q

Did he object to any of it?

2

A

I don't believe so.

Q

I looked in the record, and 1 didn’t see any

3

Now, I would further point

out

4

objection at all,

5

A

6

He continued to object throughout in the record.

He did not say Miranda versus —

7

Q

Did he object to the introduction of the state­

10

A

He continued to object to all of the interro­

11

gation in the record.

12

Q

Yes, I was looking at the Appendix.

A

We have it there I am certain.

8
ments?

morning.

14

It is in the Appendix, Mr. Justice Black.|

I reread it this

A careful reading will show on the voir dire —

15

Q

I believe the State says he did not object.

18

A

The State says that he didn't object specifically

Mr. Justice Black»

17

And they cite 40,09 of the Texas Code of Criminal

1©
19

Procedure.

They do not cite 40.09.13 which allows the Texas

20

Court of Criminal Appeals to consider any constitutional error

21

or any error in the interest of justice.
Now thca answer to this argument simply is this;

22

The

23

Texas Court did consider and then the majority opinion written

24

by his Honor, Judge Woodley, they did discuss Miranda and they
sought, to rely upon decisions where he is just a suspect, what

25

14
1

1

do you have in the truck, and he says, "Cigarettes."
And there you have a search after that, not Miranda

2
3

protected, on the street.

4

the answer to that.
Q

5

The man wasn't the suspect.

That is

Isn't it also true that the Trial Judge when he

6

asked for the voir dire cut him off and he couldn't continue

7

his objection?
A

&
9

He certainly did cut him off, overruled him and

would not allow any second voir dire of the witness and,

10

Mr. Justice Marshall, all of this took place in the presence

1!

of the jury which, of course, as lawyers we

12

very damaging where you are asserting constitutional rights in

•

13
14

front of laymen who don't understand there are certain rules to
be evaded.
Q

15
16
17
18
- 19
20
21
22

25

Now I would further point out that in our

petition for the writ, our supporting brief we point out the
Wong Son decision, the Silver Phone Lumber Company versus
U.S. and decisions of that ilk which present the fruit of the
Poison Tree Doctrine and certainly what came of this illegal
interrogation, damaging admissions, I was at the scene of the
murder, I own a gun.

The gun itself in acting out a nonverbal

confession in getting the gun.
It is like the re-enactment of a murder scene.

23
24

all know can be

suspect.

A

And then the ballistics evidence which Solicited.

I think in view of the circumstances of this case we simply
15

So

1

have here a simple failure of our Court of Last Resdrfc of Texas

2

to follow the simple words and guidelines set down by this

3

Honorable Court.
We, therefore, respectfully submit that this con­

4
5

viction should be reversed and a new trial awarded.
In conclusion I can think of no other case that

presents the clear picture of the Fictitious Waiver Doctrine
as used to wash out constitutional rights in some courts than

Appeals for the Fifth Circuit involving a State prosecution in
the State of Texas,,
If there are no questions, I have nothing further.

the Court.
I am Lonny Zwiener, representing the Respondent.

I

am an Assistant Attorney General of the State of Texas.
I agree with counsel for the Petitioner, I think the
main question in this case involves the interpretation of
Miranda and what that holds.
I would like to point out initially that it involves

a Miranda question.

I just go that far.

I say Miranda, I

think is decisive of a decision in this case.

I would like to initially point out the entry which

he condemned at least mildly into the rooming hou.se, the record

does show that the police were admitted by a woman.

not explored for either by the defense or the prosecution but

apparently they did not force an entry into the rooming house.

This was a rooming house where Petitioner was located.

ently he was' a boarder there.

Da

they use search warrants in Texas?

A

Yes* your Honor,

Q

Somebody showed me some statistics the other

I don't know if they are genuine or not* showing the

percentage is very* very, very small that the conventional way
is to go in.

Is that true?

17
A

Your Honor* I don't think that is true.

As a

18
19

matter of fact we have several cases pending before this Court
now.

I will not mention their names* where there are far too

20
many search warrants.
.21

Q

You have form search warrants down there you

22
use in all cases?

A

No* I

A

No, however, there are some counties that have

been inclined to use form search warrants»

Unfortunately the

case that I alluded to, this Court denied certiorari in a case
involving a type of search warrant and the officer seized on
this as the stamp of approval.

I have run with that type ever

since.
Q

At the Court of Inquiry you didn’t need anything?

A

I don't know, your Honor.

Q

Mr. Swisner, I understood you to say just a

moment ago you wouldn't contend that a land"lady had the right
any time to admit people to rooms of her boarders at 4s30 in
the morning.

of the house.
Q

What right did she have to do it here?
Your Honor, I was. speaking to the initial entry*
Actually I don’t think this is the critical --I don't care whether it is critical or not.

What right did she have to admit the police to this man’s room?
A

Well, your Honor, I don't know what right that

she had, your Honor o
Q

If you don't know what right, she probably had

A

I might go so far as to say that, Your Honor.

Q

Very well.

A

I am sorry that I got off on this entry, because

no right.

I think counsel and I agree that the entry and the arrest were
not really the controlling thing.
19

I do think they were

3

certainly probable cause to make the arrest at this particular

2

juncture.

3

Q

There was an arrest made at this juncture?

4

A

Yes, sir, and this is, of course, what gives us

5

perhaps the fact that there was probable cause raises into the

6

State's focus this Miranda problem, because certainly, sus™

7

picion focused on a certain man that was at this cafe.
Q

8

When you say at this juncture you mean when the

man was in bed?

9

A

30

He was arrested when he was in bed?
Yes, sir, he was, but what I was saying is the

11

fact that there was probable cause meant that suspicion had

12

focused on him and this brings into play Miranda even more

13

strongly.

14

Q

He was arrested after he stated his name?

35

A

That is true.

36

Q

Up until then they didn’t know who he was, is

17

that right?

18

A

Well, that is true.

19

Q

When he said his name, when he said his name,

20

then the officers said at that point he was under arrest because

21

they had evidence that a man by that name had just shot and

22

killed somebody.

23
24

Isn’t that right?

A

That is true, sir.

Q

But you take the record as Judge Morrison read

it, there was an arrest?

The police officer

did state that after he identified himself that he considered
that he was under arrest.

I am not sure that that is determina­

tive what a police officer says.

1 think a court can look

farther into the fact and perhaps judge that not only is the
name necessary but were you on the scene o£ the crime, and so
forth.
But actually

Q

Your Honor, I don't know»

But you are not contending these was not an

arrest then are you?

15

A

No.

Q

You are conceding that there was one as soon as

he spoke his name?
17
A

I say the police officer so testified.

1 think

Q

Well, do you think that if they had said, "What

18
19

they were.

20

is your name?

You are under arrest."

Drive him to the police

21
22

station they would have had to give him the Miranda rule?
A

I would say yes it would be required with this

23
qualification which is the point that the State relies on in
24
this case.

It is a question of waiver.

This is our main

And I would like to distinguish

O'Connor versus

Ohio» a case that 1 used to cite until this Court sent it back
21
— it went back to Ohio and came back up here that there could

22
be a waiver of constitutional rights.

O'Connor, I believe this

court said, that if the right was unknown to defense counsel,

defense counsel could not be expected to urge this constitutione, 1

He was ---- he was conoid* wasn't he?

He was given

Don31 yon run into difficulty though in that

argument with the fact that your Appellate Courts passed on the

Miranda question?

Certainly there are.

Your Texas Appellate Court considered and passed

on the Federal constitutional question»

Is that fair?

Is that ;

correct?
A

I hate to be evasive with the Court and I hate

to make this statement that I am going to make, too* because I
would hate for this Court to write an opinion that the Assistant
Attorney General is not quite sure what basis the Court of
Criminal Appeals decided this case.
But in fairness I am not exactly sure how they

17

arrived at their decision,

I think they just decided ~ well,

18
I have some difficulty,

I trust these words will not come back

m
to me in an opinion but I do have difficulty rationalizing
20
21

their decision.
Actually the majority ended dissent»

But I do,

22
nevertheless, I do urge that counsel should have pointed out
23
with some particularity what he was meaning if he had Miranda
24

in mind at the time of the State trial, what it was that he was
25

25
&

1

objecting to so that the trial court could be apprised of the

2

Miranda question and this matter could have been corrected and

3

cured at that time because I think the case could have been

4

tried a won without the use of this testimony and actually

5

without the gun that was seised at the rooming house.
And had that objection been made, had the trial court

8
7

had the opportunity to pass on it, then perhaps'as 1 say, a

8

conviction would have been had and this matter would not have

gone this far,

In candor 1 cannot distinguish Miranda.

is the reason 1 am arguing waiver.
Q

Aren't armed police officers a part of the

police station?
A

Mo, I wouldn5t say that, your Honor.

You mean that when —

Mr. Tessmsr.

TO

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W. TESSMER, ESQ.

11

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. TESSMER:

12

By way of brief rejoinder, the record

13

is not clear on the identity of the woman who admitted the

14

police.

15

whatever the case may be.

There is no evidence that she was the landlady or

Further, I would like to point out briefly that when

16
17

the objections were made numerously over some seven pages of

18

the record by Mr. Barclay, he used the word predicate and

19

predicate means what must be shown prior to using the evidence,

20

authenticating a document, proving up a letter.

21

Now, certainly any trial judge is presumed to know

22

that a predicate for admissions this damaging must be a com-”
pliance with the caution.

23

Further, had there been no objection at all, by

24

trial counsel, then I think the only waiver you could have in

25

28
1

Ii

that situation would be that it was concurred in by the accused

2

or at least it was trial strategy.
In Henry versus Mississippie the first submission*

3
4

this Honorable Court held that Fourth. Amendment rights weren't

5

necessarily waived by failure of the Mississippi attorney to

6

object and I believe the case was remanded for a hearing to

7

determine why he failed to object to an illegal search and

8

seizure.

9

If there are no questions9 thank you* your Honors.

10

(Whereupon* at ils35 a.m. the oral argument in the

11

above-entitled matter was concluded.)
