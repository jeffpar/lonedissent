So, we take the position that the rule of the 8th

Circuit is improper, that a Federal inmate, filing a motion to

12

vacate under 2255, should be provided the same provisions that

a State inmate has.

The Solicitor General’s office has argued that there

25

allowing a State inmate to raise certain seizure issues, while
a Federal cannot.
As Justice Scalli Wright pointed out in the Thornberry
case, there are many instances in which a Federal inmate may
not get even one judicial review of his search and seizure
claims if he is not allowed to use the claims under 2255.
In many cases it is not used.

inmate is induced to plead guilty because of the fact that the

Q

Are you arguing, Mr. Jacobs, that the 2255 court

must consider every Constitutional claim, even though it might
have been raised on appeal or only that it should be
discretionary with the 2255 court, whether or not to hear it?
A

It should be discretionary in this sense, Your Honor,

that if an inmate has raised the issue fully at his trial, I
believe the 2255 court should at least look at this, but I
don't think the 2255 court should be required to look at it.
Q

I don3t think in the case of a state prisoner he is

entitled to have every Constitutional claim that he might have
made a ground of appeal in the State courts entertained by
the Federal Habeas Court, is it?

relief.

There has to be a rather serious question of the Constitutional

You can only use it through habeas corpus or 2255.

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Jacob, you may

late,
That is* the attorney had gone to the Clerk and

12

the Clerk advised him that there was no formal way of raising

13

the issue at that point; that the issue had been raised in­

14

formally* however* by means of a letter.

16

it because the opinion was silent on the issue.

25

The attorney could have filed

So* therefore* the Clerk's advice was somewhat

1

misleading.

2

Under all of these circumstances, we contend that

3

the defendant’s right to appeal on this one issue was

4

unconscionably frustrated, based on denial of the right to

5

effective representation under the Sixth Amendment, based on

6

the denial of the statutory right to appeal on this one

7

question, the question of whether or not illegally seised

3

evidence had been improperly used against him.

And also we

feel that due process was denied him through the conduct of
10

the Clerk in this whole set of circumstances.
Q

Isn’t that pretty much just practicing lav; by ear,

12

when lawyers go to the Clerk and ask him what the procedures

13

are, and then claim to rely on what he tells them, instead, of

14

doing their own homework?

15

A

Your Honor, the attorneys should have known that

16

there "were normal ways to, I think, in discussions with other

17

lawyers or had they done some research they would have found

18

there were normal ways of raising the question.

1

should not have relied entirely on the advice of the Clerk,

20

but apparently he did.

21

I agree he

I don't think he should have, however.

The strict rule of the 8th Circuit, as we have already

22

contended, is an incorrect rule of lav; and should not have been

23

applied by the trial court in denying Kaufman any relief on

24

his search and seizure grounds.

25

We also contend ~~ even if it could be considered
11

1

to be a valid rule of law* even If this Court should feel or

2

find that the strict rule of the 8th Circuit is constitutional,

3

is a correct rule of law, we believe that Kaufman at the very

4

least should have been given a delayed or out of time appeal

5

on this one issue, the issue of whether or not Illegally

6

seized evidence had been improperly used against him.

7

We have cited cases in our brief from the 5th

8

Circuit, the Boruff case, the Lyles case, in which defendants

9

have been frustrated in their attempts to appeal, and the

10

Courts have given them delayed appeals or out of time appeals,

11

and we feel that Kaufman should have had at least an out of

12

time appeal on this one issue, should have had out of time

13

direct appeal on the issue of ishether or not illegally seized

14

evidence was improperly used against him.

15

The facts in the record show that the search of

16

Kaufman's person and the search of his car were illegal;

17

that the evidence was improperly admitted; that the attorney

18

adequately raised the issue at the trial; and also that the

19

introduction of the evidence and use of the evidence by the

20

prosecutor did not constitute harmless error.

21

22
23

These are the facts surrounding the search of the
person and search of the car.
After the robbery, shortly after the robbery in

24

the St. Louis area, a policeman in Alton, Illinois, which is

25

across the Mississippi River from the St. Louis area, received

Kaufman may have been induced to make this statement to the

the statement of Kaufman, plus the fact that the pistol, the

revolver, had been found in the back seat of the car, plus

13

the fact that Kaufman shortly after the robbery had been

That is right.

12

Q

You can’t object to it now?

13

A

That is right; our argument as to the gun is extremely

14

weak.

But as to the items he did object to, I think we have

15

a valid argument.

16

I would like to reserve sometime to rebut.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

18

Mr. Martin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. MARTIN, JR.,

19
2

ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT
MR. MARTIN:

21

22
23

You may.

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
This petition brings before the Court an order of

24

the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals which dismissed petitioner's

25

appeal as frivolous.

Therefore, there is no guiding light in
18

“

1
2
3
4

an Opinion as to what ground, the Court decided the case,
Q

It didn’t even permit him to lodge an appeal; is

that correct?
A

That is right.

It denied forma pauperis which, I

5

think, under the standards articulated by this Court would have

6

to consider that the Court determined that the appeal was

7

frivolous.

3

Q

The District Court first denied?

9

A

That is rightj the District Court adjudicated the

JO

merits of his claim that the taking of the drug during trial

fi

made him incompetent at that time, and then said of the search

12

and seizure claim, it was without merit and in all events it

13

could not be raised on collateral attack.

14

Q

Then with respect to the appeal, the attempted appeal,

15

the District Court first denied the petition to appeal in

16

forma pauperis, and that was followed by a similar denial by

M

the Court of Appeals?

18

A

That is right.

The only thing that the Court did

19

say in its Order, that it had reviewed the entire record in

20

this case.

21

that there are three separate grounds on which this Court

22

.

23

24
25

And I think that is Important,

Because I think

could affirm the decision of the Circuit Court, the denial of
the petition here.
That is one that in all events, even if we assume
that the claim of search and seizure was good, that the search
19

'

1

was illegal* even if we assume that 2255 is a proper way to

2

raise such a claim* a review of the record in this case will

3

clearly establish that any error in the admission of this

4

evidence was clearly harmless error under the standards that

5

this Court has enunciated in Chapman v. California.

6

The Court rejected a rule that any constitutionally

7

had to be considered harmful and reiterated its articulation

8

of the harmless error rule in Fahy v. Connecticut.

9

question is whether there was a reasonable possibility the

10

But the

evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.

11

I think another way of looking at it is if the

12

evidence had been excluded* is there a reasonable possibility

13

that the jury might have reached a different result?

14

We would submit that in this case an examination of

!5

the record shows that there Is no possibility that the jury

16

would have reached a different result had this evidence of

17

j

which petitioner now complains been excluded.

18

In argument at more length In brief* counsel for

19

petitioner has developed a theory on which this evidence that

20

was seized may have had some bearing on the only defense

21

raised at trial* the insanity defense.

22

Petitioner never contested the commission of the

23

crime.

24

government to show that the petitioner acted rationally on

25

the day of the crime*and that that fact that he acted rationally

Petitioner says that thi3 evidence was used by the

<“

20““

1

undermined his defense of insanity.
I think the basic weakness of that position is

a
3

found in the fact that the insanity defense at trial was not

4

based on a claim that the defendant was irrational on the day

5

he committed the crime, but rather- that he was acting pursuant j

6

to an irresistible impulse; and indeed the petitioner’s trial

7

counsel argued that the fact that he behaved rationally on

8

the day in question had no bearing on it.

9

the Court to page lay ox une Appendix.

And I would refer

This is the summation

10

of Petitioner’s trial counsel.

20

Changes can be schizophrenic,

The person is still able to reason in this
He is not rendered conspieious so that

That doesn't mean that he isn't in

So this was the theory of the defense, that petitione

21

could appear to be totally rational at the time he committed

22

the offense and yet still be driven by an irresistible impulse

23

to commit the crime.

24
25

We, therefore, submit the admission of this evidence
could not possibly have affected that defense.
21-

1

We would point out further* if the Court please*

2

that the evidence that the petitioner behaved in a rational

3

manner is overwhelming in this case»

4

First* the petitioner went into the bank in question
i

5

and was in the bank for approximately twenty minutes before

6

he actually pulled out a gun and announced it was a stickup»

7

He first went to a teller and discussed the purchase
of travelers checks, whether he could give a personal check

9
1
11

12
13

to purchase travelers checks* whether he could take out a loan
to purchase them.
He then had a discussion with another bank employee
concerning the taking out of a loan.
Their testimony indicates that during this entire

14

period of twenty minutes in which he was in the bank petitioner

15

was entirely rational.

16

that petitioner was acting rationally on that day.

17

So that their evidence alone establishe

In addition, the FBI agents who interviewed petitione:

1

on that night, one of whom was with Petitioner for approxi­

19

mately four hours, testified that all during that time

2

petitioner was totally coherent and responded to questioning

21

and gave no indication of any Irrationality.

22
23
24
25

This was confirmed by several of the other people
who interviewed petitioner on the night of his arrest.
So the evidence was, as I said, overwhelming that
petitioner was behaving rationally on the day in question.
22

™

1

Further* I would point to the fact that petitioner's

2

counsel presently argues that this evidence may have led the

3

Government to the fact that the petitioner traveled from New

4

York to St. Louis to commit this crime* that he made stops

5

along the way.

6

to the Government absent any of the items seised* because the

7

record establishes during the testimony of Agent Peefc, who

8

interviewed petitioner on that evening* that petitioner fully

9

told the agents everything about his activities on the day of

10

Hov/ever* that information was also available

and prior to the robbery.

!1

At page 95 of the Appendix — this was on a hearing

12

outside the presence of the jury — Agent Peet gives a rather

13

extensive summary of what petitioner told him on that day*

14

mentioning the fact that he traveled from New York to St.

15

Louis for the purpose of committing a robbery* that he stopped

16

in Alton, Illinois* on December l6th* the same day of the

17

robbery* and purchased a gun; that he also purchased a holster

18

and some ammunition; the route he traveled* etc.

13
20

21

So that all of these factors were also otherwise
available to the Government.
Nov/* I submit when this record is reviewed in totality

22

it is clear that any error in the admission of these few items

23

that were seised from petitioner's person at the time of his

24

arrest* when he was in custody* and from the car subsequently*

25

would clearly be harmless error under the standards articulated
23

1

by this Court

2

Having said that., I would like to turn to the quest ion

3

petitioner has argued at some length., and that is the question

4

whether or not the claim of illegal search and seizure is one

5

which can be raised on habeas corpus or its statutory counter­

S

party a 2255 motion; and we* of course, draw no distinction

7

between the two types of remedies, habeas corpus or 2255»

3

In Sumnal v. Lodge, this Court decided that the

9

remedy of habeas corpus was not available to test issues that

10

could have been raised at trial and on appeal, at least where

11

the error complained of was not a constitutional proportion.

12

The Court did note in some cases, even where

1.3

constitutional claims had been raised and they had been denied

14

where there was appellate relief available, we also recognize

15

that there will be exceptional circumstances where, even though

16

as a general rule you might say that 2255 would not lie,

17

exceptional circumstances may make it appropriate for the Court

13

to provide the remedy of a habeas corpus proceeding,

19

We would submit that even when the questions are

20

constitutional, there are strong policy considerations why

21

prisoners should not be allowed to raise collateral matters

22

that they could have raised at the trial or on direct appeal.

23

Q

24

is it?

25

A

That argument isn’t rested on any language of 2255*

Mo, it is not.
24

“

“

I

Q

The language of 2255* by Its terra, at least, indicates

2

that the precise claims being pressed here, the constitutional

3

ones, are cognizable ones?

4

A

I think basically it is a question, as you mentioned

5

before , Mr. Justice Brennan, in discretion, in what instances

6

does the 2255 go to the merits of -she claim advanced.

7

It is our position there are certain constitutional

S

issues which could be raised at trial that should not be

9

ordinarily heard on a. 2255 motion.

iG

We recognize at the same time there are others that

11

are so basic to the fairness of the original proceeding that

12

even though they could have been raised—

13

Q

Do you think the test we have had in availability

14

of federal habeas remedy to state prisons and the extent to

15

which discretion is to be applied by the federal habeas judge,

16

do you think those tests are equally serviceable in the 2255

17

areas?

13

A

19

20

I think they are serviceable,

I think there are

different considerations.
Q

We did say that there are circumstances, although it

21

is a federal constitutional claim, when a federal habeas judge

22

is justified in refusing to entertain it, didn't we?

23

A

That is right.

24

Q

What I am wondering is can we have a counterpart here

25

in 2255?

Are we going to have to fashion standards here
25

»

1
2

different from those we fashioned in the federal habeas?
A

I think certain things have to be taken into

3

consideration that are different.

4

Fay v, Noia for the Court makes clear one of the purposes of

5

the federal habeas corpus statutes to state prisoners was to

6

make available a federal forum for the litigation of the

7

prisoner's federal claims.

8

I think your opinion in

It seems to me that that federal forum has been
provided here, and I think that makes a very clear distinction

10

11
12
13

between the two situations.
I think also th£fc basically some of the considerations
are the same.
We would suggest that to start from a general rule,

14

without talking for a moment about the exceptional circum­

15

stances, that there is a balancing of Interests to be con­

16

sidered normally in a habeas corpus proceeding when a prisoner

17

asserts denial of constitutional right.

18

There is society’s interest in the finality of the

1

judgment and there is the prisoner's interest in the adjudi­

20

cation of his claim.

21

Now, the question basically as we would present it

22

xvould be which constitutional issues are such that they

23

should be considered on 2255 regardless of the availability

24

of direct appeal to handle those issues and those that should

25

not, and we would suggest to the Court a useful analogy in

1

solving this problem in the general terms is provided by this

2

Court’s decisions in the cases involving retroactive appli­

3

cation of the newly articulated constitutional principles *

4

In those cases the Court has recognized that the

S

new constitutional principle should be applied retroactively*

6

to use the words of the Court in Roberts v„ Russell* "if the

7

Constitutional error presents a serious ri3k that the issue of

8

guilt or innocence may not have been reliably determined
On the other hand* in the retroactive cases the

9
10

Court has recognised that where the constitutional principle

11

doesn't go to the reliability of the fact finding process*

12

the principles should not be applied retroactively,
We submit also that where a 2255 proceeding or

13
14

habeas corpus is taken sometime after the conviction, the

!5

Court should not generally allow the assertion of even

16

constitutional claims that could have been raised on direct

17

appeal* or at the original trial* unless the constitutional

18

claim raised is one that seriously throws into question the

19

reliability of the fact finding process.

20

We submit that the case presently before the Court

21

presents all of the same policy considerations that were

22

present in Linkletter v. Walker* when this Court determined

23

not to make Mapp--

24
25

Q

criminal trial to raise something on appeal and it is one of

S

Then I think you are talking about exceptional

circumstances which would have to be considered.
I am talking about the normal claim where a man comes

5

Then what?

in and says--

Q

If you are going to use the Linkletter and the

7

retroactive eases* you are about to say that obviously search

S

and seizure claims then ordinarily ought to be left to direct

9

appeal and never be the subject of a 2255?

10
11

A

Well* I would say that It ordinarily would be left

to direct appeal andnot the subject of 2255*
Again I would say there may be extraordinary circum­

12

13

stances.

For example* if the failure to raise it is such that

14

it could amount to deprivation of counsel.

when there are exceptional circumstances.

want to relitigate Issues some substantial time after the

20

trial.

And I think the main one* the hearing itself.

23

very difficult,

Professor

And perhaps some­

Amsterdam suggested in his

First* that memory is dim.

But I think the

Witnesses may be lost.
It is difficult

So there are those policy considerations going„

24

Mapp also made clear that retroactive application

25

wouldn't serve really the purpose* the deterrent purpose of

1

the exclusionary rule, and we would submit similarly here that

2

no purpose of the exclusionary rule realistically would be

3

served by allowing this type of claim to be raised collaterally,
5

I think it is clear that a police officer wouldn’t

4
5

risk searching a car illegally knowing that the evidence would

6

be excluded on proper motion, on the hope that perhaps it

7

wouldn’t be raised, and then it couldn't be raised collaterally
I don’t think this would have any significant impact

0
9

on the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule»
So for these reasons we submit as a general rule

to
11

habeas corpus should not be allowed to test claims of illegal

12

search and seizure, absent some claim of exceptional circum­

13

stances, and I would like to now address myself to the

14

consideration

before I do that, I might treat briefly one

That was the case where the claim was an

I think in that situation you have no competing

21

22

interests.

On the government side the matter Is basically

23

determined on the record and the time, and if the relief is

24

granted there will not be a new trial, the case would be

25

dismissed.

So there are no finality interests really present
29'

«"

1

in that type of case.

2

even though the matter could have been raised on direct appeal,

3

because there the prisoner's remedy and right is to be totally

4

released from the prosecution, and there will be no retrial.

5

But I think ordinarily where the claim is one that

I think there habeas corpus may lie

6

doesn’t go to the integrity of the fact finding process, and,

7

two, the remedy would really be to allow the prisoner a hearing,

8

if he prevailed at the hearing, a retrial,

9

the interest in finality expressed in Linkletter v. Walker

militates against allowing on habeas corpus the assertion of

claims of such as illegal search and

I would like to turn myself to the question whether

14

or not there are extraordinary circumstances in this case which

15

would justify the grant of habeas corpus.

16

We submit that there are not.

Counsel argues that

17

there are extraordinary circumstances because the petitioner

18

wanted this matter raised on appeal and it was not raised.

19

I think, first, and counsel, candidly admitted though

20

it’s petitioner’s assertion that he raised this matter with

2!

counsel prior to submission of brief and oral argument at the

22

original appeal, Kaufman’s own letter, page 62, appended to

23

the original brief of petitioner, shows he never raised the

24

search and seizure issue with his counsel until after counsel

25

had submitted his brief and presented oral argument,

This

letter was submitted to counsel April 26th.
In addition* the letters of the Clerk of the Court

3
4

also make clear the letter set forth on page 58* the Clerk of

5

the Court to Mr. Jacob* that Kaufman’s letter was submitted

6

to the panel that decided the case* Kaufman’s letter* prior to

7

the decision of the case.

8

So I think it is clear that matter did get before

9

the panel and we submit that the fact the panel didn’t mention

10

this issue in their opinion does not mean they didn’t consider

11

it* but rather 1 think that they agreed with petitioner’s

12

counsel* who himself stated he thought this appeal to be of

13

little merit* at this point to be of little merit.

14

1 think counsel on appeal made a deliberate choice.

15

He looked at the search and seizure issue and found it to be

16

of little merit and looked at the insanity questions and issues

17

related thereto and determined that the best issue to raise was

18

the insanity defense.

Q

Does the record show as to the caliber of represen­

tation he had?
A

Well* I think the record shows, among other things,

Mr. Justice* that the man who represented him at the trial

was a man of some prominence in the local Bar.

He was either

Also» I think, a close examination of the record at

'i
2

trial shows several things.

One, I think that itfhen you look

3

at the presentation, of the insanity defense, I think that it

4

shows that petitioner was well represented.

5

connsei got the most out of the facts that were available to

6

him.

I think that

I think that the record will also show as to why

7
3

counsel did not make a search and seizure claim and in fact

9

supports the conclusion that counsel determined that, one, the

10

search and seizure issue meant nothing, since petitioner was

11

going to admit the crime, and his only defense was going to be

12

insanity; and, two, from the record, as he saw it, there was

13

really no hope of success on the search and seizure claim

14

because, one, the searches were apparently legal; and, two, in

15

all

16

of the car that occurred.

events, no interest of petitioner was invaded by any search

17

Q

Then he had another lawyer appeal?

18

A

Yes.

19

Q

A different lawyer, not an additional lawyer?

20

A

A different lawyer.

21

And that lawyer determined that

the search and seizure was no good.

22

Q

At least before the Court; of Appeals?

23

A

Then when petitioner raised it with him, he did, when

24

submitting a petition to this Court, assert it.

25

have here a eonoeiencious choice of counsel on the issue,
“

32-

But I think we

1

particularly in light of the issue that was raised at the trial,

2

that the issue was not worth raising.

3

Q

Based on your criteria for distinguishing between

4

the claims that are open for 2255 and those which are notj

5

namely* whether the issue goes to the integrity of the fact

6

finding process* why should it help if you are not going to

7

open up search and seizure claims for 2255?

O

Why would it help to raise the same claim in terms

9

of denial of counsel because the only inadequacy of counsel

10

was that he failed to raise an issue about the admission of

11

some evidence v/hich is perhaps perfectly reliable evidence

12

and which wouldn’t really go to whether ornot guilt or innocence

13

was properly determined?

14

A

Well* I would think* Mr. Justice White* the problem

15

is if a man had counsel which the record indicated was so

16

inadequate; for example* if the only evidence against the

17

defendant was illegally seized narcotics—

18

Q

And he just plain failed to raise that?

19

A

Then it seems to me there is some question that the

20

man didn't get the counsel he was entitled to.

21

has basically held that the right to counsel is retroactive

22

at all stages.

23
24
25

Q

It has held that.

Also, I think it is clear, and I would like to refer
to one thing in the record.
1 think that the search of the car, the search and

12

seizure claim is probably the more significant.

13

time he was searched incidental to his arrest or after his

14

arrest, although he was originally arrested because the officer

15

inthe patrol car heard there was a hit and run and this car

10

was involved, he was arrested and he claimed he was drunk at

17

the time and he was then taken into custody on the traffic

18

violation; and I think the evidence 'was accumulating that he

19

had involvment with the robbery,

20

So

I think at the

X think it was reasonable when they got him back

21

to the station to take his personal effects from him and in

22

effect search him for the fruits of the crime which he might

23

otherwise destroy while he was in custody.

24
25

I would like to turn to the search of the car and
point out some of the things that the agents knew at the time
36

'

1

they did search the car.

One of which I think is most important
.

2

in this case is that the fact that the agents had at the time

3

they searched the car found on petitioner.,what had been taken

4

from petitioner, the rental agreement under which that car- had

K

been rented..

«-»

All these events occurred on December 16, 1963«

6
7

The petitioner had in his pocket at the time of his arrest a

3

rental contract for the car.

3

and it was in evidence

That rental contract provided -~

that the renter agrees to return said

10

vehicle to owner at point of origin on or before December 15,

11

one day before the robbery — December 15, 1963 — at demand of

12

owner.

13

it may be considered conversion and may be treated the same

14

as theft of vehicle from the street.

15

If said vehicle is not returned at specified time then

So the other thing in this contract is the fact that

16

it was in the name of Arthur Cooper, not petitioner, and the

17

contract also provides in Section 9D, the vehicle described

IS

herein shall not be operated by any person other than the

19

renter who signed the rental agreement, to-wit, Arthur Cooper,

20

So that at the time this car was searched the agents

21

knew, one, it was being used in violation of the rental

22

contract in two respects, one of which said it should be treated

23

as a stolen car.

24

car, one, by the terms of the contract it was considered stolen,

25

and, two, that it was not to be returned to petitioner, it was

So they knew at the time they searched this

«

37»

1

to be returned to the person to whom it belonged , the Metro

2

Auto Rental Company,

3

involved when they went and searched this car.

4

holding the car for return to its proper owner.

So there was no right of petitioner
They were

We submit that under these circumstances, since

5
6

petitioner had no right to the car* that there was no illegality

7

in the search which affected petitioner.

8

we submit that the search and seizure was entirely proper.

So for this reason

In conclusion, I would just stress that we have set

9
10

forth what ws consider are three separate and distinct reasons

11

why this Court may affirm the denial of the writ of habeas

12

corpus or the 2255 motion in this c ise.

13

(1)

That at best any error was harmless;

14

(2)

That the petitioner's claim is one that is

IS

not

cognizable under 2255; and
(3)

16
17

20

a the searches of which

petitioner complains were entirely proper.
For these reasons we ask the Court to affirm the

18
19

That in all eve?

judgment below,
Q

Concerning the last point you made about the contract,

21

do you think the police have the right, when they find a con­

22

tract of this kind and have seized property from a defendant,

23

to read a contract and determine as between him and the lessor

24

or the seller, that the seller has the right to the car and,

25

therefore, they can search and take it back and give it to him?

€M> 3 3‘*°

1

A

Well, I think there are several considerations

2

involved, Mr, Chief Justice, one of which is that this car

3

was the instrumentality of the crime,

4

would assume that it is general knowledge — I certainly know

5

from my own experience and 1 think the FBI would know that

6

the 8Z license plate, anyone in Mew York familiar with that

7

would know, and I am sure the FBI are, is a rented car,

8

knew this was a rented car used in the perpetration of a crime

9

and used at a substantial distance from the place of rental,

10

(2)

They knew and I

They

I think they have every reason to suspect at that

1!

point that the car is in fact stolen that is being used in such

12

violation of the rental contract that really it is a conversion

13

and theft.

14

have the right to examine this

15

So I think at this point, for that reason, they
ontract further.

I would agree with the implication of your question

16

that not every search gives the agents the right to look through

17

a man’s private papers.

18

the car, to use the old distinction, an instrumentality of the

19

crime.

20

Q

But I think such as this, when you have

That isn’t the question that bothered me.

You said

21

a moment ago that they were actually holding this car for

22

return to the property owner.

23

A

Yes, I think when they read this contract and saw that

24

by the terms of the contract as of December 15th the renter of

25

the car said that that car is to be treated as stolen, they
39

'

I

had the obligation to hold that car- for the rightful owner

2

and not to return itj that it was by the terms of the agreement

3

a rented car and had to be held,

4

Q

What follows from that?

5

A

1 think it follows from that that really their

6

search was reasonable in the circumstances and didn't violate

7

any rights of petitioner.

8

Q

That is your point?

9

A

Yes, sir.

5

Q

It isn't that gave them any reason to search the car?

11

A

I think it also tends to follow., I would say, the

Cooper side of Preston.
Q

It may be that somebody had standing to object, but

this fellow didn't?
A

That is correct.

I think they are both points,

really.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE R. JACOB, ESQ.
MR. JACOB:

If it please the Court, Arthur Cooper,

2

the man who rented the car, was Kaufman's friend.

21

the car for Kaufman's benefit.

22

He rented

On the 15th, the day before the robbery, Kaufman

23

sent money back by telegraph to his girlfriend.

24

cashed the money order in the presence of Arthur Cooper and

25

Arthur Cooper presumably used that to extend the lease on the

As to standing* the Government during the trial

2
3

never contested that the defense had standing to object to the

4

introduction of this evidence.
The car definitely was not stolen.

And I don’t

think a private contract such as this can make a car a stolen

car.

8

larceny,

Only the laws of the sovereign can declare what constitutes

9

We believe that the use of the illegal evidence in

to

the trial and the references to this evidence during closing

11

argument by the prosecutor did prejudice the defendant on the

12

issue of insanity

13

All of the psychiatrists in the case, including the

14

Government psychiatrist, agreed that Kaufman was psychotic,

15

he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.

16

The defendant's pscychiatrist said categorically

17

that Kaufman on the date of the crime was not able to control

18

himself, was not able to prevent himself from committing a

19

crime he knew to be wrong. So this was the defense, the defense

20

of irresistible impulse.

21

The prosecution paraded eight lay witnesses before

22

the jury, all testifying as to Kaufman's outward appearance

23

on the day of the crime and the day before, how he was able to

24

speak normally and walk normally and so on.

25

This, however, is only one aspect of insanity.
41

»

It

1

is true that outward appearances have some relevance in determ-

2

ining insanity, but this is one part of the overall picture.

3

The psychiatrists know the history of the disease.

4

They knew what pressures were on Kaufman., against Kaufman,

5

at the time they knew how he would react in response to the

6

pressure, and the prosecutor emphasized this one phase of

7

insanity, the outward appearance.

8

that outward appearance alone is not conclusive on the issue

9

of insanity.

10
11
12

And the psychiatrists said

In fact, you can be completely Insane and yet appear
to be rational.
During closing arguments the prosecutor referred to

S3

the pieces of evidence showing that Kaufman had driven the

14

car from Mew York all the way to St. Louis in a period of two

15

days, that he stopped along the way, bought gas and telegraphed

16

his girlfriend, and so on; and as he i?as referring to the

17

pieces of evidence, he said, ’’this defendant was insane on

18

December 16th?

19

look at what he was doing at about that time, on the l6th, the

20

day before, the day after.

21

drove from New York.

22

drove through Pennsylvania the day before the robbery.

23

things show what he was doing."

In the context in which the prosecutor referred to

There was some confusion during the argument of Mr.
