ARGUMENT OF ALBERT W. HARRIS, JR. , ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

MR. HARRIS:

7
S

No. 163, Evelle J.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
This is an appeal by the District Attorney of Los

9
10

Angeles County in California from a judgment and order of the

11

District Court in Los Angeles, a. three-judge District Court,

12

convened pursuant to a complaint filed by the appellees here

13

holding the California criminal syndicalism act void on its

14

face in all of its provisions and particulars and

15

of how it might be applied.

16
17
18

«

regardless

In addition, the three-judge District Court issued
an injunction against the District Attorney, Mr. Younger,
enjoining him from any further prosecution of John Farris,

19

who was then under indictment in the Superior Court of Los

20

Angeles County.

21

In arriving at this conclusion, one which has been

22

appealed hare by both the District Attorney, who is the party

23

below, and the Attorney General of California, we contend that

24

the District Court was wrong, that the District Court should

25

have dismissed the complaint to start with and if it did reach

1

the question on the merits that the proper consideration of

2

State law in California construing the criminal syndicalism

3

act would have required the Court to hold that the statute was

4

Constitutional and not unconstitutional and. we ask this Court

5

whichever it might choose to do* either send it back for purpose £

6

of being dismissed

7

case to start with •— or if you wish to reach the merits,, why,

8

we think you should hold that it is a valid statute in light of

9

the California decision.

because we don’t think it is a proper

We say that the Court should have dismissed this
complaint below without any farther ado.
John Karris had been indicted in September of 1966
and charged on two counts with violation of the criminal
syndicalism act.

Re was charged with passing out leaflets

which advocated criminal means for bringing about changes in
our society in California.
The leaflets were appended to the indictments? as
usual, under California procedure, he was furnished a transcript
of all of the testimony at the grand jury, which shows the
facts underlying the prosecution.

None of that is before you.

None of that was before the District Court.
Unlike the case you heard argued here earlier, there
were not related counts involving the possession of weapons
or such things.

In addition, the criminal syndicalism act

should not be confused with the criminal anarchy statute in
5

3

1

New York.

They both stem from the same general idea and —

2

as does the Smith Act, which, of course, you have upheld.

'

But

J
-

3

the California act, instead of simply stigmatizing the advocacy

4

of the overthrow by force or violence of the government, speaks

5

quite differently.
it addresses itself to the advocacy of particular

S
7

means of bringing about social change, and it lists those means

8

and it lists them very specifically.

9

sion of a criminal offense.

It refers to the commis­

It refers to Scibofcage.

It refers

10

to unlawful acts of' force and violence and it is only the

11

advocacy of these criminal means, criminal ways of bringing

12

about changes in the society, that are stigmatized.

13
14

The

objective must be a change, either in the political structure,
or a change economically, the whole statute having been drafted

15

at a time when the advocacy of economic change, and perhaps

1G

even, in this regard, a political change,was popular.

jurisdiction Constitutionally.
plaintiffs

We think as to three of these

it was clear that the Court had no jurisdiction.
Mow, Harris filed this complaint and he was awaiting
}

trial on his indictment.

He had attacked the indictment in the

State Court.

He had asked the District Court of Appeals, our

intermediate

appellate Court, for a Writ of Prohibition. It was

25

4

t

denied there and he applied for a hearing in the State Supreme

2

Court and denied there»
Under our procedures the higher Courts had the discre­

3
4

tion to rule on a matter of that kind or notP as they see fit.

5

He was not foreclosed from raising the Constitutional question,

6

later, if he was convicted, in the normal appellate process»
But he went into the Federal Courts and, perhaps

7
8

sensing some problem under Section 2283, he brought along some

9

additional plaintiffs»

Two of them were members of the Progres­

10

sive Labor Party»

11

a matter of fact, was, himself, a member of the Progressive

12

Labor Party.

and, I think as

They said they had advocated some doctrines seeking

13
14

Harris, 1 believe, alleges

change in industrial ownership and so forth and they felt

IS

inhibited, in attempting through peaceful, nonviolent means,

16

to advocate their program and, therefore, they wanted some

17

19
20
21
22

23
24
25

relief.

1I
Another plaintiff was brought it by the name of

Broslawsky.

He was a teacher at one of the State colleges out

there and he said he thought about the doctrines of Karl Marx
and he thought about the Communist Manifesto and even read from
it and now he was uncertain as to what he could say in light
of this statute.
Mow, these are the only plaintiffs before the Court.
The only action by the State that occurred was the indictment
5

1

of Harris„

There were no arrests, searches, no announcements,

2

manifestos, as you found in Dombrowski, about what anybody is

3

going to do with this group or, as far as I know, to any of

4

these plaintiffs»

5

Harris, of course, charged with anything»

;

They have never been, with the exception of

Indeed, the District Court after proceeding to find

6

7

the California law unconstitutional on its face, stated,

8

unequivocally, that they were under no apprehension and that

9

there was no danger, whatever, that these three people would be

10

prosecuted or that the Courts in California would entertain a

11

prosecution on the grounds that they stated in the complaint»
Now, we shy, having said that, they have no jurisdic­

tion as far as these plaintiffs are concerned and we rely, as
has already been mentioned here on your decision in Golden
against Zwickier and we don't think that these people had
presented any kind of a case or controversy to the Court»

We think, specifically, as to the injunction in connec

8

fcion with the prosecution of Harris, that that is barred by

9

Section 2283 and that is developed in our briefs.

I don't

10

want to go into that in too much detail except to say this;

11

That this case presented a very excellent situation for the

12

application of the abstention doctrine and so you can see the

1.3

value of 2283 in failing to restrain a State Court prosecution. |
■
There are two complaints, basically, about the

14
15

California statute.

One is that it is vague.

We don't know

16

what it means.

17

prohibits things that they should be allowed to do.

The other one is that it is overbroad.

It

The contention of Harris and his fallow plaintiffs

18
19

is that they don't have State decisions thatwill clarify these

20

points.

Now had the Federal District Court declined to act on

21

this case and had' Harris ever been convicted in the appeal is

22

no question but that any vagueness problem that there' is — I
.

23

am not suggesting that there is a vagueness problem, they

24

think there is — could have been resolved by the State Courts

25

and, in defining the conduct, the area of conduct

7

1

proscribed perhaps removed completely the overbreadth question

2

and, thus, removed completely any necessity of a Constitutional

3

adjudication»
After all, if the statute doesn't apply to what you

4
5

might think is protective conduct, then you don’t have anything

S

to decide.

7

This case was a perfect vehicle for this to be done

8

and not for the Federal District Court to show what we think,

9

in all due respect, was unseemly haste in declaring a California

10

State law unconstitutional.

It is a long opinion and it discusses, I think, all of

the cases that had intervened and all of the concerns that
this Court has manifested over the years with the need for
protecting

free speech and drawing a line between free speech

and illegal advocacy and he even, in that opinion, announced

11

a test which is even stricter than your own Dennis test.
He said that the danger aroused by the speech had

wanted to use a school room to hold a meeting, an oath that
you did not or had not advocated the overthrow of the govern™
menf.

It was argued in the State Supreme Court that the

civic center act and its oath requirement was the.supplement
to the criminal syndicalism act and it was to carry out .the
purposes of that act.
12

So, in order to appraise that argument Judge Trainer

addressed himself to the criminal syndicalist act, what it

3

meant and what it prohibefeed and anybody who is in any doubt

about what it prohibited can find, in that opinion, what it does

prohibit.

A coroner's inquest

was held, at vyhich all the witnesses testified as to what had

happened and I don't want to go into that.
They started it and then they had to stop because

there was just too ranch disorder and unruly behavior so they

- 5

moved it from where you would normally hold an inquest, where

6

you would have three or four people, to the biggest courtroom

7

in the county courthouse in Los Angeles, and that is some court,

8

much bigger than this room.

It holds several hundred people.

The place was completely braced with police.

But he won't be convicted unless it rises to

that level of advocacy.

8

advocating very bad causes.

' V

14

I think, Your Hcnor, we have tried to point out that

15

there has been a change in our society. It isn't that somebody

16

That complaint alleged that Harris faced indictment, that he

21

had raised these issues and the State had refused to consider

22

them.
It raised the question of the validity of the

23
24
25

statute on its face, claiming that it violated the First
Amendment.

It was suppressive.

It, obviously, was vague.

It,

1

obviously was overbroad.

The

cases that run from Piske against Kansas, not

3

the more recent ones, the cases that run from Young against

4

Oregon, Thornhill against Alabama, Herndon against Lowry, all

5

of these cases, including the decisions of this Court, the

6

Keyishian, et cetera, and Dombrowski, all point in only one

7

direction, that this statute is unconstitutional on its face.
The Court, therefore, felt that it was obliged to

8

9

re-examine Whitney in the light of the developing Constitutional

10

doctrine that had gone on since that time and it could only

11

reach the conclusion that the statute on its face was clearly

2

3
14

5
16
17

invalid.
This is not really disputed in the briefs, at least,
by the appellant, because what they, in effect, say are really
two aspects:

One, that after all the State Courts had

interpreted the criminal syndicalism law and interpreted it
in such a way as to satisfy First Amendment guarantees and
J

10

9
20
21

22

that, in any event, some of the petitioners do not have standing
and that the one Harris cannot obtain his injuctive release
because of Section 2203.
There is no, and cannot be, any serious claim that
this statute today, on its face, is not unconstitutional and
.

23
24
25

courts, three-judge courts, in Kentucky, in Mississippi, in
Georgia,have all declared their statutes, criminal syndicalism
statutes,to be unconstitutional on their face.

23

i

I might say that soma of tha judges in their opinions

have indicated that they couldn't conceive of an argument that

3

could today Constitutionally support the validity of a criminal

4

syndicalism statute.
What is it, therefore, thatthe appellant is really

5

6

arguing here?

First, the argument is made that three of my

?

appellees don't have standing, that a case or controversy is

8

not presented.

Is that accurate on this record?

They accepted our allegation that a teadxer in a

10

State college is teaching the doctrines of Karl Marx, is

11

teaching about the Communist Manifesto, is teaching revolutionary

a person in this case is engaged in the kind of teaching or
advocacy that the statute on its face prohibits.

But do you

think that that is the narrow holding, that that is the holding
of Bombrowski and Zwickler?

I think that Bombrowski and Zwickler are at

least indicative that where a statute is patently invalid on
its face and where the parties indicate and it is accepted
for the purpose of this record that they are engaged in the

Q

What are the overt acts?

I would say this:

these persons have alleged, and it is accepted, that they are

19

to answer, Your Honor, as I read Dombrowski, it is true that

24
25

Q

Well, patently invalid on its face covers a lot

of ground; doesn't it?

I suppose that is one of your major

argument in this case.

Do you also argue that even if the

statute should be read as having been narrowed by some past
decisions or even if we should assume that the California
Courts would narro? if to some extent, do you contend that in
this narrowed form the State wants to pressent it as
unconstitutional?
A

Yes, there are a number of aspects to that.

My answer is, yes, with this explanation:

First, if X have

29
i

1

reviewed very carefully the decisions of the California Courts

2

since 1919, up to the last time they spoke on the criminal

3

syndicalism law, and the construction there is fraud and is

4

not restricted and does not follow the Constitutional doctrine

5

enunciated by this Court in interpreting the Constitution»

6

I might say, following Danskin, counsel has pointed

7

out that Danskin came.,

S

nor the Court for simply saying, if you are trying to implement

9

the criminal syndicalism law of course there has got to be

the issue was not directly presented

10

a clear and present danger, of course, if the American Civil

11

Liberties Union wants to use the school auditorium is not a

12

clear and present danger and that was it»

13

I

If you read all of the decisions outlined in 22 and

14

23 of my brief and read the decisions that followed almost

15

by 10 years the decision in Danskin and that is Black against

16

Cutter Laboratories where Mrs. Walker, and I quote from it on

17

Page 22, was a member of the Communist Party, whereupon, the

18

Supreme Court of California said, "That constitutes a violation

19

of the California criminal syndicalism act, per se.

So, from the construction, they are not limited and

of course the Court refused to pass on it when we asked them to.

to effectuate the judgment,where irreparable injury is done by

11

is another exception of 2283, we should have a right to get

In addition, I think history and law would indicate

13
14

that those

who passed the Act of 1871, the predecessor to 1983,

15

must have intended, even if they didn't say so, that the

In Danskin it was made very clear that this statute had

Danskin is part of another matter, isn't it?

In that case Judge Trainer was trying to get out of a box that

he was in because of Whitney and this discussion of the criminal

that the statute that they had before them was considered to be

Yes.

I think it is.

1 think he felt he had

to reach that and I don't think that this statute should fall
because of some debate about whether it was dicta or holding
under that particular situation.

I think it is very clear

from the opinion.
Even if it weren't clear, Your Honor, I would suggest

17

an authori­

tative interpretation by the California Courts of the criminal

1 was quoting from his opinion.

Are you suggesting to us that Danskin

10

the criminal syndicalism statute and that

that this Court has a duty to construe the statute in light
of your own decision, without regard to what California has
decided.

You have decided Dennis and Scales and Yates and

these words are not new and you have given them very limited
meaning and I think you have a duty to construe them in order
to sustain the statute and not in order to destroy it.
Q

Do you have any examples of a Federal Court

in a declaratory judgment action like this attacking a * State
35

1

statute of declaring the statute to be unconstitutional insofar

2

as it reaches some things that it shouldn’t reach but leaving —

3

but saying it is Constitutional in other respects?

4

For example, it is a claim that this statute is

5

overbroad and reaches some kinds of teaching that it shouldn't,

6

which I gather is essentially the claim; isn't it?
Can a Federal Court say that, yes, we agree the

State

it reaches these forbidden areas that it is unconstitutional,

to

14

and insofar as

and stop there?
Normally, I understand that the Federal Court has

11
12

statute is unconstitutionally overbroad

said — to find it overbroad it just strikes down the statute.
'i

A

Well, that is certainly what it did here.

Q

But do you see any barrier

to just sayingthat

15

it is unconstitutional insofar as it is overbroad which would

16

leave the State in the position that you suggest, of enforcing

17

the statute within the narrow valid area.

18

A

No, I don't think it is a matter so much of

19

application of the statute.

I think that is what you are

20

suggesting in ruling on the various applications that might

21

be made —-

22

Q

The attack is on its face.

It says that it

23

reaches some kinds of teaching that it shouldn't reach; isn't

24

that right?

25

A

Well, it is claimed that it is too vague, anyhow.
36

1

That is a little different concept.

2

Q

That is right.

3

A

They make both contentions and it was so held

Q

Well, if it is the vagueness thing, I can under­

stand this.

Q

11

You don't just read them as if you have never

You mean they should act like a State Court

and say this is what this statute means?
A

12

Well, no.

They aren’t a State Court.

I don’t

13

think they should, in that sense, try to be one but no lawyer ,

14

that I know of picks up a statute and looks at it and says,

15

well, here is the word teach, so it has got to have something

16

to do with teaching in the classroom.

17

None of us construe

statutes like that.
The first thing we do is look at the statute and we

18

19

start to look at the cases and that is just what the District

20

Court didn't do.
Here, had it done that, I think it would have con­

21

22
23
24
25

cluded that, as construed and as narrowed in the State construc­
tion, this statute jts perfectly valid.

1 say it is valid on

A

its face as it has been construed.
But even if you weren’t satisfied and you thought

37

1

Danskin to go to something else and the other cases are old

2

and so forth, still, in all, 1 think that Court has

a duty to

This Court said so in Fox against Washington.

We have used the same words that you have upheld

time and time and time again and now, I think, to turn around

and say they are too vague or overbroad, we don't understand

them would be contrary to your
