Do you think the Sta·.:ns could adopt ;. rule, just

talking about State autt>orii:.ies, saying that welfare payments

14

would not be made to anybody who was not a resident of the

15

State on January 1, 1969?
A

17
18

You might be able "t<> do that, say • We are going

to have a limited a~ount :>f money and this is the bi,dget.

Q

Then it becom-l!s true.

I think when it im1ol•res mainly State-raised

section l7-2a should be found -::onstitution.:il, l1r. Jus::ice F'ortas, because for th

court to -ay that a State can't do that is

1

an invasion, I th:..nk, '3f a very fWldamental · egi. slative func-

4

tion; that is, the raising of their own state tax fundu and the

5

spending of than.
Q

The Constitution did juvade States' rights. The

Fourteenth ~m<1ndrnent is a sub_ tantial invasion o.: States• rig'it.

A

I don't think it was written for t;hat.

I chink

10

in its histori.c<1l context, and this coui:t hae. recem:ly agreed,

11

in McL.s<ughlin versus l'lorida, the histoi·ical ccntei.t 1'ias to

12

say that a person should.'l' t be discriminated againsc on the

13

basis of race.

14

So "i.f a State had a very poor benefit program and the:,

15

said we are only going to appropriate a c~rtain amount of money,

16

but it didn't discrim1.nata on the bzsis of race, then the

Fourteenth Amendment would apply.

If Yo r Honor is referring to the Edwai:d~. case, I
don't think the E<lwaz:ds case applies here at all.

In the Ed-

wardu case, nr. Slaff, ~ho was Edwards' counsel, scid the
relevancy of th

California. statute was that it 1nti11idated

unde.~ threat of criminal prosecut,.on, c~rtainly if you threatened to prosecute a person ~ho is contLng across a State line.
It is a coosider~ble differencd if you say, "If you

23
24

25

"~nd you are not willing to work, or at least trained to work,
or have assets to keep youzself for three months, you may have
to wait a year before you get welfare."
I think there is a considerable difference in that
type of case.

In fact, in the Edwards case, Mr. Tolnn, for

the Select Committee, said that the law shouldn't .,pply in that

I kno,1 they have an open-end budget and I would say probably

17

for the ,;ize of the State the most liberal in the Ur.i ted States.

Am I wrong in my recollection, from the last

migration was not very big?

They could maintain their same high standard with some

cut off, or they could lower their standard like the other

I think they wisely chose to follow the former.
I think, thirdly, the Connecticut statute, itself,

to enter the labor market.

i2

thiG Court. has clearly seen t~at there is a double standard

13

when it comes to the tyoe of discrirninc..tion which the Congress
or thc rtate Le_isJ.atures my make, cEpcnding upon the type of

15
16

right t.hat is involv.d,
Bollina.v. Sharpe was clearly a discrimination based

on race, nnd thi~ court will not tolerate discriminations

18

baned upon t~at particular ground,

19

20
21
22
23

24
25

The Court's opinion in Bolling v. Sharpe refers back
to such case$ as Detroit sank v. the United States, where a
Federal tax ~tatute was discriminatory in that it applied to
one type of property and not to the other, but, nevertheless,
was upheld, c1nd, likewise, to Currin v. Wallace, a 1939
supre,ne Court: ca$C where the exercise of the Examiner's power,
while it was subJect to Fifth l\mendrnent principles, nevertheles~
40

i

could be discriminatory.

a condition of

outlaw residence requirements of 1TOre than one year, leaving the
situation with respect to residence requirements of a year or
less exactly where Congress found them .

It said more than a

year is bad, but it said nothing about the rest one way or the
other.

Fi:-=st, if'

'

ing, then the action of Congi:ess, even on you1: constru,;::ion in

23
24

A

Well, no; I think not,

because I think Congress

wasn't reall~• adc.ressing itself to the question of whether it
is "our judgnent that these .:ire not inconsistent" with
9

privileges or immunity ':est c,lau~c.
2

It was simplf saying

"We- don't say .:.aythir.g .1bout it".
But, of c:our "', on the app.:-oach .hat I .:;te.ted at the

3

4

outset, I think one doJsn't have to conce:.:-n hi:nself with that

5

q11estion, because on

G

11

concerned with this more technical ~cope or just ~h~t body

12

they apply too. just what technically is the source of the

13

right.
I should remind the Court, as we point out in our

,.

·~

b=ief, that the ldr1inistrator of the Social Security, and the

16

Secretary of the Oepart:mc'nt of Health, Education and Welfare,

17

has

equal p:t·otection clause in a substantive sense, not because

18

he concluded t~ey violated the equal protect:i:n clause, neces-

19

sarily, or ertablinhing other inequitable classifications.

20

The two examples that come quickly to mind are his

21

ctisapproval of the plan t1hich would have excluded Indians,

22

I

children of l.ndians, and hj_s disapproval of a plan that would
have excluded illeqi~imate children.

The Connect~cut statute is on page 36 of the Con-

It is a lit~le bit different from the Penn-

The difference is worth

noticing, along with one matter of fact.

The Connecticut

statute, the vecylast page in the brief, says:

three elements:

17

diccrimintes in relation to the Zundamental neceus:.ties of

18

life, between two classes of persons who a·ce identlcally

19

s!.+:uated in terms of need, the appropriate,1ess of the remedy

20

22

2:,

First, that the on:? year residence requirement

'that is offered o.".' any oth~r thing of that 'cind, save how long
they had been there or where they came from.
Seconc, the sole basis of classification is a differentiation between the new and the old resident, the old
being granted assistance and the new denied it.

But that

discrimination against strangers, agai!".st newco.Tiers, against

shown really not to stand up by any careful analysis.

14

:( do want to em':lh.:isize this,

15

I think one could argue

16

anj as we do argue in some of our briefs, that perhaps some one

17

or two of those three eJ.cnents in the case would be enough to

18

make out a case for uncon.;ti tutionali ty.

l9

court tta: we don't need to go that far, tla: all we reed to say

20

is that adding all three together, the one year's prior resi-

22

the equal protection laws.
Let me develop each of the three points, but prelim-
