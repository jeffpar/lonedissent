ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. PETER G. PETROS

Counsel are present.

MR. FETROS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the j

court, my name is Peter G. Fetros.

I represent the appellant

In this case, Mr. Enrique Perez.
In this case there was a four count indictment, four

12

count complaint filed against my client concerning three

13

different instances.

14

the trial the defendant took the stand and testified upon.

15

the third and fourth counts, which involved one incident which

16

was separate from the first two, the defendant did not make any

17

statement on the stand, and upon being cross-examined or

18

attempted to be cross-examined by the district attorney

19

defense attorney raised an objection which was sustained by the

The first two counts of the indictment at
On

his

'i

20

trial court.

Thereafter there was no further attempt to cross-

21

examine the defendant on the separate incident — the third and

22

fourth counts.

23

the case there was a collateral crime which was brought into the

24

case on the grounds that it was a similar modus operandi.

25

court allowed the collateral claim to come in, but here again

In addition to these three incidents involved in ;

The

I

there was no cross-examination of the defendant when he was on
I

the witness stand.
During closing arguments, since Griffin had not been

5

decided by this court, the prosecutor made comment on the fact

6

that defendant did not testify as to counts three and four nor

7

was he able to cross-examine him concerning counts three and

four because the judge had told him that he was not able to
cross-examine the defendant.
Then the instruction was given which is the same in­
struction contained in the Griffin case.

We have before us now

a clear case to determine the scope of the waiver of the privilege
]

of self-incrimination when a person takes the stand on a multi­
count indictment.
We have an unusual situation here in one respect:
that the trial court determined that the district attorney could
not cross-examine on counts three and four.
The Supreme Court of the State of California said
that was in error, that the counts 3 and 4 formulated a common
plan and design and therefore cross-examination under the
California statute was permissible.
i

It then went on to say that due to the federal
l

decisions that had been rendered in federal cases concerning the

j

scope of the waiver of the privilege that the privilege ex­
tended to all that which encompassed legitimate cross-examinatioiji
and the Supreme Court of California therefore held that the man,

4

\

when he took the stand, waived his right to self-incrimination

2

as to counts 3 and ;43 could have been examined by them and

3

could not now complain.

4

I say this is wrong for three reasons, actually four.

5

Firstj the crimes three and four were not a common

6

plan and design by any stretch of the imagination although the

7

Supreme Court held that in that case.

8

now says that the Perez case,, the one on appeal here, is to be

8

very limited in scope when determining what is modus operandi.

10

n

The case which came later

The crimes which were charged involved holdups of
grocery stores and taverns.

The collateral crime which was

brought in was another holdup of a tavern, the timing of the
13

holdups were different.

14

area, there were holdups in the 1:30 area, the number of people

15

involved differed, the weapons were different, ranging from

16

savied-off rifles to pistols.

17

supposedly committed the crimes were different.

18

There were holdups In the seven o'clock

The descriptions of the people who

Therefore I say that there was not this common plan

19

or design and cross-examination was not permissible at the

20

state court level.

21

But even If there was a common plan and design in the

22

specific case, as other cases have ruled, if examinations where

23

evidence is admissible for a particular purpose is probative

24

in effect may be outweighed by the amount of prejudice which can

25

be let in against the defendant.

In these multi-count complaints the man is on trial

for each separate crime that he is charged with.

against himself on those particular counts.

The district attorney has to prove

Therefore, when a question is asked in

There is a statement in your brief which is not quite

clear to me, on page 6.

You talk about the sentence imposed upor

10

your client.

You say on counts 1 and 2 to run consecutively

11

and counts 3 and 4 concurrently.
Does that mean that 3 and 4 were consecutive to 1 and

12

13

2 but concurrent with each other, or does it mean they were

14

concurrent with counts 1 and 2?

IS
16
17

A.

Concurrently with counts 1 and 2.

His maximum sentenc e,

therefore, would be at the expiration of count 2.
Q,

Count 2.

Now, 3 and 4 sentence imposed were fully

18

concurrent with the consecutive sentences imposed upon counts

19

1 and. 2.

20

A.

That is correct.

Unfortunately in California we have

21

an undertermined sentence.

We have this situation where the

22

parole board meets and determines what the sentence will be,

23

based on the past record and they will also take into considera­

24

tion the fact he was convicted of these crimes in determining

25

what he would be eligible to do.

1
2
3

Q

Counts 3 and

would never end later than under 1

and 2 under these sentences?
A.

That is correct 3 although it could make a different

4

reason on whether or not 1 and 2 were extended during this

5

indeterminate period because this is within the power of the

6

parole board.

7

Q

I suppose the parole board could consider anything

including the fact he was accused of other crimes.
9

A,

That is correct.

But I think it would have much

10

greater bearing to know that he was actually convicted of txtfo

11

crimes after a jury trial.

There is a line of cases in the federal courts that

would indicate that if the judge says when a man takes the stand

14

you are not waiving the privilege against self-incrimination —

15

you cannot turn right around and say afterwards — the judge

bhe cross-examination, *!

22

’

23

This court reversed on the basis that the man could

24

have explained something possibly if he was forced to testify,

25

and so here in Perea maybe the man could have explained some-

8

j

1

thing if the objection which his defense attorney had raised was

2

not sustained.
Instead what happened, he sustained the objection,

3
4

and then they made the improper argument at the end concerning

£

the inferences to be drawn.
I should make it clear that this last method of

6
7

finding convictions 3 and 4 of all the convictions to be set

8

aside is the easy way out because 1 think that the time has come

9

for the court to indicate how much a person waives when he takes

to

the stand.

11

he waive it as to matters which are only within his knowledge?

12

Camlnettl has been quoted time and time again — as being the

13

case that says all of the old relevant cross-examination was

14

allowed.

15

incriminations to that extent.

16
17

Does he waive it as to all cross-examination or does

You have the privilege of cross-examination as well as

That is not what it is saying.

The reason the court

has focused into Griffin rule is that the comment and the

18

instructions which are given focus attention to the fact that a

39

man is silent.

20
21

22
23

In effect it is shattering to constitutional

right to remain silent.

|

Basically the man cannot testify to a lot of these
things because he does not have them in his own knowledge.
There was a companion case in Peres in the lower

24

court level called Ng.

Dr. Ng was charged with a couple of

25

counts of rape by the use of drugs.

9

They brought in three

collateral crimes with three different people.

He was not

2

charged on these crimes.

3

They made the comment concerning the fact that he did not testify

He did not testify as to those crimes

What would happen if instead of the Perea case where

4

!

5

i
there was some possible explanation and knowledge on his part in i

6

the cross-examination area that the specific question he was

1

asked on cross-examination was "Why were you at so and so’s

8

house with the two men immediately after the robbery which

9

occurred in counts 3 and

"

If we change the facts just a little tiny bit and

to
11

say that counts 3 and 4 were there and there was no such questior

12

are we to say that because It is a similar crime which I am not

13

agreeing to, but if we say because it is a similar crime a man

14

can be cross-examined as to each one of the elements of a crime,

15

I do not think he can.
How can he reasonably be expected to know, to explain

IS
17

and defend himself to these elements which are beyond his

18

knowledge?

19

dull-witted should be made equal with the quick-witted. When

20

they are asked a question about where they were at a particular

21

time both can say we are not going to answer rather than the

22

quick-witted one can make something up

23

cannot.

24

think.

25

What we are saying is that the quick-witted or the

and the dull-witted one

That is the real substance of the Griffin rule, I

If that Is the case then what I am saying is that on
10

1

each count in an Indictment for a complaint, the man should be
able not to say anything which is beyond his knowledge on those

3

matters and no inference can be drawn from the fact that he

4

remained silent.

He just did not know.

5

”What were you doing on November 10, 1964?”

6

How can he defend something like that?

Maybe it is

7

usually peculiarly within his knowledge but I think that in this

8

day and age everyone realises that unless something unusual

9

happens he is not going to remember what happened on that

10
11
12

13

particular day.
Q

If everyone realises that, then the jury can be

assumed to realize that, too.
L

That is right.

Then we get into the idea of what

14

the instruction focuses attention on the fact that he remained

15

silent and did not explain something.

16

comes in, just like in Griffin. You are focusing attention on

17

something you are attempting to protect.

18

Q,

This is where the problem

You are his lawyer and if a. lawyer is representing

evidence and were able to pass it out.

e

as you already said we cannot get convictions on 1 and 2 unless

7

we find that this comment on 3 and 4 somehow infected convictions

on robberies which were on different days, and I take it that

9

involved separate facts and you suggest the defense alibied

10
11

as to those txtfo?
A.

Yes, sir.

That is right.

When this inference came

12

in as to 3 and 4 they were attempting to segregate 3 and 4 but

13

they could not do it without scope of the trial and the type of

14

evidence that came in.

law who testified as to where they were.
Q,

24

did not testify to as to counts 1 and 2, could have been

25

commented on.

1

A.

Yesj definitely.

2

Q.

Yet you say failure to talk about 3 and 4 tainted his

3

The problem there is what sort —

convictions on 1 and 2?
A.

4

That is right.

They were narrowing in on his failure

5

to be cross-examined on 3 and 4.

6

The next case that comes up will perhaps be a case where they

7

would have no comment on 3 and 4 but they try to say that he

8

failed to explain something back in 1 and 2.
Q,

9
10
11

12

1

There was no question on that.

You agree, don’t you, that we have to get to counts

and 2 before you can get any relief on any of these counts?
A.

Nos you could reverse as to 3 and 4 and not reverse

as to 1 and 2.

13

Q.

It is not even a case in controversy, is it?

14

A.

I am sorry. I just can’t answer that.

15

Q,

You are familiar with the ordinary rules, are you not?

16

L

17

Q

18

Yes, sir.
Concurrent sentences

it is conceded at least that

two of the convictions must stand?

19

A.

I have not conceded that.

20

£&

I know you haven’t.

You said they were tainted.

I

21

a.m trying to find out in exactly what respect you say that

22

convictions by the jury on one and 2 for those separate trials

23

were tainted by the comment of the prosecutor on his failure to

24

testify as to 3 and 4.

25

A.

Because on 3 and 4 you are also bringing in the idea

14

i

1

that by finding him guilty of 3 and 4 they are saying it is a

2

similar type crime.

3

ft

Yes a but you have to says don't you, that they

4

convicted him on 1 and 2S in part because they felt he was not

5

to be believed in his defense of 1 and 2 if he did not take the

6

stand as to 3 and 4?

7

A.

That

is correct.

a

ft

That

is what you are saying.

9

A.

That

is correct.

We

cannot say how much they dis­

10

counted its though.

Maybe it was just right there on the border

11

line and just shoved it over because of this inference.

12

the basis of what I am saying.

13

back to re-trial and sever the counts if that is what we have

14

to do.

That is

It would be fairer to send it

In the federal system when there is a joinder of

15
16

counts and there is prejudice possible to the defendant they

17

sever as a matter of right— if this is brought out as a matter

18

of trial.

In California we do not have that.

19

Based on that we are requesting a dismissal and we

20

are requesting also a reversal and a broad rule in respect to

21

when a person does take the stand what does he waive — his

22

right to the overall, to the offenses charged, or both?

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Haws.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. EDSEL W. HAWS

2

FOR RESPONDENT

4

MR. HAWS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

court.

6

We have the California comment rule here again today

7

but under much different circumstances than presented in Griffin, j

8

and in the Chapman case.

9

dant did not testify.

.

TO

In Griffin, as you recall, the defen­

It was there held that that part of the

comment rule of California which permitted comment by the
prosecutor and a standard instruction by the court cut down and

12

violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incriminatior
Today we have the other side of the coin., as it were,

13
14

of our comment rule.

Our California constitution permits comment

15

In those situations as here where he does take the stand and

16

fails to explain evidence, fails to explain or deny evidence
*

17
18

within his knowledge.
It is respondent’s position that the privilege does

19

not apply and the California comment rule is valid here in this

20

situation where he does take the stand but fails to explain or

21

deny facts within his knowledge.

22

We think this conclusion follows from the proposi­

23

tion and the many cases that by taking the stand voluntarily as

24

here he waives his privilege against self-incromlnation.

25

The waiver, of course, under the holding below, is

!

/

9

not unlimited.

The waiver in this ease and in the many federal

2

cases cited in our brief is determined by the scope of relevant

3

c ro ss ~e xamination.
The landmark case cited in our brief is Caminetti.

4
5

That has been followed in such leading cases as Johnson versus

6

the United States, which has held that the waiver of the

7

privilege is not limited by the fact that defendant’s answer

8

might tend to establish guilt of a collateral offense for which

9

he was fully prosecuted.
Now this to me seems Important.

to

Does this waiver of

1?

the privilege concept conflict in any way with our comment rule.

12

In other words, do those rules hit head on?

13

do if we consider the history underlying the privilege.

14

was detailed precisely in the court's Griffin case.

I don’t think they
That

The court pointed out the two main policy considera­

15
16

tions underlying the rule.

The first is that not all people

17

have the ability, however innocent, to withstand the perils of

18

the witness stand.

19

comment cuts down on that right.

In that situation the court noted that

It Is readily apparent that that is not the situation

20
21

here.

The petitioner, while represented by counsel, the public

22

defenders of Sacramento County, voluntarily took the stand.

23

must have weighed the possibilities of relying upon the pre­

24

sumption of innocence or the advantages of putting forth their

25

versions and facts.

The:

Of course, after weighing that the decision

17

\

was made to take the stand.
Another reason given in Griffin is that some defen­

z
3

dants will not take the stand — not that they cannot explain

4

the present charge against them but due to the fear of impeach­

S

ment by prior convictions, that reason has no validity here

6

because the petitioner did have prior convictions — they were

7

alleged in the accusatory pleading.

8
9

Q,

May I ask, Mr. Haws?

I don't find in your brief that

you make any argument based on the concurrent sentences.

10

A

No,sir, I don’t.

ii

California in this case and in the companion case of

10

People versus Ng on the waiver principle followed the rule that

11

has been followed in the federal courts; that is, that the

12

waiver extends to permissible or relevant cross-examination,

13

and the court below reasoned this case, as it did in the com­

14

panion case of Ng, that counts 3 and A showed a planned scheme

error in favor of the defendant.

1

The Johnson case,, of course, points out that where

2

the privilege is claimed, when a witness takes the stand if a

3

privilege is claimed and granted as in the Johnson case, and

4

then there is comment — of course that is not playing the game

5

fairly and there would be prejudice.

the situation here,

Q

But that was certainly not

What would happen if there was an objection to the

cross-examination about counts 3 and 4 and the objection’ that

was sustained so there was no testimony about 3 and 4 from him,

10

but there was comment —

11

A.

12

Q,

That is right —Then when the California Supreme Court said no, the

law of California is that there was no privilege as to counts

So you see,

there —

10

Q

I know, but he is claiming the privilege now.

11

k

Now, but you see the prejudice would have to relate

12

to a factual situation, Your Honor, as in Johnson the defendant

13

did claim a privilege which the trial judge granted.

14

15

0,

Do you think that the Supreme Court of California

also said that this was unprivileged?

10

k

They didn’t discuss that.

17

Q

They said this is not beyond the scope of cross-

18

examination.

19

k

That is right, and since it Is not—

20

Q,

And do you think they also ruled it was unprivileged?

21

k

I think that would follow.

22

Q,

Wouldn’t they have to in order to —

23

A.

I think it would follow that if it is within the scope,

24
25

the privilege is waived and therefore he should have answered.
But here under the factual situation I would say that
21

1

the error of the trial court benefited the defendant because he

2

did not have to attempt to explain what happened to the —

3

Q

A situation in which the witness was told that he

4

could avail himself of the privilege, he did, and then he was

5

prosecuted for contempt, and the Supreme Court of Ohio said he

6

should not have been told he could avail himself of the

7

privilege because there was an immunity statute and therefore

8

he had to testify.
This court held that states cannot do that with

9
10

witnesses and claim denial of due process.
How do you distinguish this?

11

As I understand it.

12

what happened here is that there was an objection which was

13

sustained on the ground that it was not relevant cross-examina

Your Honor, his direct examination was in on counts
Certainly he had made no claim of privilege.

That is right.
Then when he was asked the question as to counts 3

21

22
23
24
25

and 4 the objection was not on that you are going -Q

So the point here is that the objection was made,

whatever the gound of the objection was.
A.

The objection was made not that you are requiring him

to Incriminate himself on a matter not eha.rged but you are

2

going into matters —

3

Q

Beyond the direct testim ony.

4

A,

That is correct.

5

Q,

But unless you utilize the concurrent sentences rule

6

Mr. Justice Brennan was asking you about it seems to me that

7

something in Ohio and Murphy versus Waterfront and cases like

8

that really are not very relevant.

9

it was known he would have to testify, he would rather testify

I am not so sure that if

10

than have the privilege because the Supreme Court upheld that

11

comment.

T2

A.

Yes, upon this ground which was within the xcope of

13

relevant cross-examination.

Of course, at the time of the trial

14

Justice White, Griffin had not been decided at that time so the

15

standard instruction and the comment was proper under California

16

lavr at that time.
The way I view the cross-examination is that since

17
18

the defendant was not required to answer questions which un­

19

doubtedly would have been incriminating it was to his benefit,

20

Q,

Anyway, then, he did have a choice in the sense that

21

he knew there was going to be comment If he did not testify.

22

That was the California law then.

23
24

25

A,

In any event whether he took the stand or not

comment would have been permissible at the time of the trial.
Q

Mr. Haws, I am having trouble in seeing myself here
23

1

as to what happened in the California appellate courts.

2

looking at page 11 of the Appendix Index where there purports

3

to be an opinion of the District Court of Appeals of the

4

Fifth Appellant District which, if you look at page 32 said,

5

"The judgment is affirmed as to counts 1 and 2 of the informa­

6

tion and reversed as to counts 3 and 4."

7

I am

There then follows., beginning on page 23, what

8

appears to be the opinion of the Supreme Court of California

3

which ends up on page 29 f,the judgment is affirmed.”
Does that mean the judgment of the District Court

10
11

of Appeals affirming as to counts 1 and 2 and reversing as to

32

counts 3 and 4 is affirmed?

13
14
15

A.

That is what it seems to say.

Noj Your Honor, that language relates to the

judgment of the trial court.
Q

That wasn’t the judgment, was it, that the Supreme

16

Court of California was reviewing.

17

judgment of the District Court of Appeals.

18

A

It was reviewing the

No, Your Honor, when our Supreme Court of California

19

grants a hearing it is reviewing the conviction or judgment.

20

The case is set aside in the Third District Court of Appeals.
So as the case stands before the court today all

21
22
23
24
25

counts of the convinetion have been affirmed.
Q

So I consider the judgment is affirmed — the judgment;

and the conviction on all four counts?
A

That would have been a full explanation, yes, Your

24

?

Honor.

Just on that one point, I notice that in the dissenting

2

opinion by Justice Peters, in a concurring opinion, he would

3

have agreed with the Fifth District Court of Appeals.
Counsel has made some mention about some prejudice

4
5

because of California's joinder provision.

6

joinder provision provides that offenses connected together in

1

their commissions or on offenses of the same class9 such as here,

Q

robbery, against a single defendant, may be joined.

9

that was done in this case.

Just generally the

Of course

There is some implication in

10

petitioner’s brief that this provision somehow cuts down on

11

privilege.

12

Q,

I do not think the factual situation here
Why do you say following Justice Brennan’s comments

13

that all the evidence on counts 3 and h3 as a matter of Califor­

14

nia lav/, were admissible on the charges under counts 1 and 2 as

15

part of the modus operandi?

16

A.

17

Q

That

is correct.

So if there never had been counts 3 and *1, if there

18

never had been, that evidence nevertheless would have been

19

admissible in the evidence on counts 1 and 2.

count 1, then it would have been within the permissible scope of

3

cross-examination, his privilege would have been waived, and,

4

in even carrying it further, on the second trial, assuming four

5

separate trials on the separate trial, then I would assume that,

6

if his answer on cross-examination had been incriminating, that

7

could have been used against him in the second trial as a

8

judicial admission.

If he took the stand as to

One more point on the joinder provision and cutting

evidentiary connection with another robbery, it would have been

5

Q

That

is right. Your Honor.

The court excluded cross-examination as to counts

6

3 and 4 on the evidentiary basis, that that cross-examination

7

would be beyond, the scope of the direct.

8

not?

That is right, is it

9

k

That

is correct.

10

Q

Does

it follow that the prosecutor,

the privilege

11

having been waived, could have made the petitioner his own

12

witness and proceeded to examine him with respect to counts 3

13

and 4?

14

A.

I don’t think that would follow. Justice Portas.

Q

Then I don’t understand because it seems to me that

it is the necessary logic of your position as a necessary

resulted in a waiver of the privilege as to counts 3 and 4.

Why could not theprosecutor call

You are saying that the privilege was waived.
A.

Well,, I think that calling him as his own witness

4

would no doubt open up a broader field than what he had to work

5

with and what he could work with under relevant cross-

6

examination.

7

Q,

Then don't you have to say that the privilege was not

3

waived as to counts 3 and 4.

The prosecutor presumably could

9

put petitioner on the stand, the petitioner being by hypothesis

10

in possession of relevant information, and he could then examine

11

him on direct as his own witness, as the state's own witness,

12

if the privilege were waived.

13

A.

I would say that the waiver extended to counts 3 and

14

4 because that would be permissible cross-examination and he

13

can do that because the privilege is ’waived.

Why, if the privilege has been waived, can't he?

somewhat too coercive for a prosecutor to call a defendant.

hat the privilege was waived as to counts 3 and 4■.

To answer your question all 1 can say is this:

But the court did not allow him to examine as to count

A.
as error.
Q.

That is true.

Our California Supreme Court said that

He should have allowed that cross-examination.
On the grounds that there was a waiver of the

rlvilege?
A.

No, there is a waiver of the privilege, Your Honor,

29

because It is within the scope of cross-examination.

It was

proper cross-examination because it showed his plan, a general
denial, you see. bringing in the collateral matter.
Q

Yes, I see what you mean.

But I still suggest to

you that if it is your contention that the privilege was
waived that would open up the defendant to being called by the
state if the state wanted to do it and examine him with respect
to the entire scope of counts 3 and 4.
A.

Your Honor, I would think logically if you could

insulate it to this cross-examination waiver problem it would
logically follow, perhaps.

But as I mentioned, so many other

aspects of calling the defendant into the
Q

I understand that, but we have to look at this thing

as a matter of principle not to look at the perimeter of the
problem as well as its immediate focus,

I suggest to you that

what you are telling us may result in the logical conclusion
that if a defendant takes the stand as to any counts there is a
waiver as to all counts, then the net result of that is that
prosecutor if he sees fit can examine the witness, examine the
defendant as his own witness, with respect to those other courts
A,

Your Honor, that has not been the history of the

situation in the federal practice.

On this principle of waiver

to the extent of permissible cross-examination, Camlnefctl I
think was decided in 1917, and no one has contended that under
Ithe Camlnettl principles, I know of no federal prosecutor who
30
i

1

has contended that by virtue of his waiver he can then put him

2

on the stand.

3

One final word.

Assuming a Griffin error-s I would

4

ask you to consider that this is a situation -where Chapman couldi

5

apply.

6

Considered in the light of the situation that he did take the

7

stand and the jury could draw their own conclusions without the

8

situation in Griffin, without being aided by the prosecutor and

S

the court, I think it points to the conclusion that error, if

10

any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and we submit that

11

California decision should be affirmed.

12

Q

The coment here was not extensive as in Chapman.

May 1 ask you, Mr. Haws, suppose the court had not

13

found that these were similar offenses and therefore he could

14

be cross-examined on that scope but put it on the grounds of

15

pure waiver,

16

A,

Could this be sustained?

Some of the earlier federal cases seem to indicate

17

that the waiver of the privilege was not bounded by the scope

13

of cross-examination.

Caminetti indicates that.

Some of the later cases in the federal courts,

19
20

Johnson, the Brown case, and so forth, would indicate that it

21

is tightened, that the waiver of the privilege extends only to

22

the scope of relevant cross-examination.
If those cases were followed and It was not a

23
24
25

connected crime, then Griffin would be violated.
Q,

Should we have a broader scope of cross-examination

31

i

1
2
3
4

for a defendant than for a witness, an ordinary witness?
A.

1 would say it would perhaps be broader for the

ordinary witness since he is not charged —
Q,

Suppose then a witness in this trial had testified
i

5

as to count 1 only.

6

2, 3S and

Would you have cross-examined him as to

A.

3

Q

Yes.

9

A.

No, Your Honor.

10

Q,

11

An uncharged witness?

I don’t think so.

Then there is a difference

in scope according to

your theory as between a witness and a defendant.

12

A.

That is true.

13

Q,

And it is broader for the defendant,,

14

A.

What I meant was that the non-charged witness can be

15

questioned about many things in a much broader area because he

16

is not charged, and I think the privileges would work

17

differently between the non-charged witness and the charged

18

witness»
Have I made myself clear?

19

20

Q,

My time is up, Your Honor.

I do not see how that follows if you say that if he

21

testifies concerning one count he cannot be cross-examined as

22

to the other counts.

23

A

Your Honor, I think it is the theory that the non-

24

charged witness is not being ■— you are not proving anything

25

against him but as to the defendant you are proving an offense

against him.

3
4

Q,

When he makes a general denial he has in effect

He did not make a pjeneral denial on the witness

stand as to 3 and. 4, just 1 and 2.
A.

3

That is right.

But because of that general denial

6

under the rules of evidence he makes a general denial also of

7

counts 3 and 4 and therefore within the scope of cross“examina”

8

tion.
Q,

9

Then you would say that even if 3 and 4 were not

10

similar offenses under the similar offenses rule in California.*

11

that they could still cross-examine him if he testified con­

12

cerning 1 and 2.
A,

13

I am sorrys Your Honor.

I did not mean that.

The

14

California court did not hold that.

15

if you have no evidentiary connection between a robbery you

16

could not cross-examine him on it and he 'would not have waived

17

his privilege.
&

18

That is the holding below.

Could you tell us in just a moment what went to make

19

these similar offenses?

20

not.

21

My illustration was that

Counsel said in his opinion they were

That is the only reason I ask you.
A,

I have a chart9 and just running across they were

similar because of clothing2 because on all counts they searched

23

other areas looking for other things such as a radio in count

credit cards in count la and in counts 3 and 4 they also
searched other areas.
