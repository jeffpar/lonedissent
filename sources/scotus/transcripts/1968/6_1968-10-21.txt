ii

MRS. NORTON;

Ii

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court.

:

Petitioners are members of the National States Rights

12

Party, a political party, committed to white supremacy, to which j

13

they wish to win adherance through the democratic process.

14

j

Specifically the record shows the running candidates

15

in the Democratic and Republican Parties as well as Independently!.

16

The amazing way of reaching the public is through political

On August 6, 1966, in Princess Anne, a sparsely

a

populated town of 1351 persons, petitioners held a rally»

facts break down roughly two ways»

4

rounding the issuing of the temporary injunction, and the

5

circumstances and facts of the rally as revealed at the hearing

6

of August 17th, which led to the final injunctional in this

7

case, the temporary injunction was gotten because at the end

S

of the rally of August 6th, another rally for the next evening

9

was announced, though no violence or even any need for police

10

intervention to control the crowd in any way occurred at the

1!

12

temporary injunction for ten days»

Such in­

The temporary order and writ of injunction

1

"rally, gatherings, or meetings, anywhere in the county that

2

would excite to riot or ocher illegal acts."

3

Though the writ of injunction itself addressed to the

4

parties by name made clear that the court construed any

5

gathering by this party as enjoined, not simply those that

6

might excite to riot, et cetera, for it enjoined the use of

7

any sound amplification equipment in the course of public

mee tings, such equipment being necessary to hold such meetings.

Petitioners were not able to find

hearing at the court.

available to the court at the time of the issuance of this

20

ex parte injunction the tape from the August 6th rally, but

21

the court issued the injunction against furthe rallies without

22

listening to that tape at that time.

23

It is important to note that there was

The tape recording reveals a description of the

24

party's aims, particularly repeal of 1965 Civil Rights Act,

25

and other Civil Rights Acts then under consideration.
4

i

Their speech in caustic terms was a call to action,

z

but in every case,, a call explicitly to political action,,

3

Examples of this are rampant in the record,,

4
5
8

They called, for example, for those who heard them
to "Organise intelligently, fight intelligently,"
They said, for example, that the National States

7

Rights Party advocates every legal, legitimate and political

8

inaudible word in the book to stop race mixing,

9

As to the specific political actions urged, to the

10

whites, they said, for example, that they were phoned and

11

button holed one James Bond to the end that the schools not

12

be continued to be integrated in the county.

13

Their only remark that appeared to be addressed

14

specifically to the 25 percent of the crowd that was Negro

15

urged them to start taking reservations to Africa,

16

Since this remark appears to be among the more con­

17

troversial in the record, it should be seen in its entirety

18

in context.

19

we don't need you, you are off, you are dead, get ready to

20

leave this country, get ready to leave the country, you can

21

leave in a lot of ways, you can leave on a boat, you can leave

22

running, you can bicycle, or you can leave in a box.

23
24
25

The petitioners said in the course of that remark,

This is a white man's country, Princess Anne is a
white man's town, this is a white man's country,
A witness testified that following this exhortation,
5
i

1

both groups appeared interested,,

2

Earlier, party officials ---~

3

Q

Well, now, don't you think, don't we have to

4

accept that the thought of leaving in a box was a reference,

5

at least, to violence?

G

A

Yes, it was, indeed»

It was a possible refer­

7

ence to their leaving as a result of some sort of violent act.

8

3ut it is important to note that in advance of that exhortation,

9

"he Party officials had noted, and this is earlier, this is

before this comment, that the Party’s official position about
Hegroes was an adoption of the position of Abraham Lincoln,
namely that this country should send Negroes back to Africa.
Moreover, the remark in question was not followed
by any exhortation to the crowd to either start now or at some
future date to seeing to it that Negroes leave in a box, or
even to seeing to it that Negroes leave in any other way.
Rather, immediately following this remark is a classic call to
organise politically and nonviolenfciy, to wit.
Let's organize, let's hear a great human cry come up
from the people, and I guarantee you white folks out there you
vill win every single political objective.
And a few sentences later, another of several calls
for specifically nonviolent political action, to wit, bring
your friends back out here tomorrow.

We want a shout to come

out of this town. A nonviolent shout that every local politician

6

1

is going to hear.

a
3

We want McKelvsy to hear it, Governor Tallos to hear
it, Congressman Morton and all the LBJ9s.
Q

4

Mrs. Norton, I am not clear from what 1 have

5

read as to whether there was in the community a state of ten­

6

sion at the time that this rail'/ took place.

7

Had there been disorder?

a

Was there trouble in the

community?
A

D

According to the record, Mr. Justice, the last

50

disorders had been in February, 1964.

11

There was specific testimony that relations between the races

12

in the town in advance of February, '64, had been congenial,

13

and since then has been congenial.

It was then August, 1966.

It was on the political crescendo of everyone coming

14
15

back tomorrow and raising a nonviolent shout to political

13

leaders that the rally ended, as the audience was invited to

17

come up and take out $8 memberships into the National States

13

Rights Party.
The use of the word “NiggerM to denote

59

Negro occurred

20

throughout the rally, but it provoked neither the Negroes present

21

nor the whites.
In the first place, no one was specifically called

22
23
24
25

a Nigger.

One of the Petitioners gave as a reason for the use

of the word, every time you call a Nigger a colored person, you
are apologizing to them because they are black.

7

There was clearly a political reason for the use of

1

2

the word.

3

The county's evidence —■

4

Q

Well, nowf there was also evidence that, wasn't

S

there, that there had been two rapes in the locality, of white

6

women, allegedly by Negro assailants?
A

7
8

n

When

this rally was held?
Q

9
10

Mr. Justice, you mean two rapes recently?

I thought recently that the speaker was asked

not to refer to, and did not refer to, but instead of that,
he talked about a 1933 incident, and about the lynching, the

12

last lynching in Maryland, as I understand it, over here on

13

the Eastern Shore?
A

14
15

1G

the crowd, I want you to know that I am not advocating that
kind of action, I am expounding a bit of history.
Q

17
10

ID

22
23
24
25

Yes, and then he also told them about the Chicago

incident, where white people rose up, kicked hell out of the
Niggers, burned 32 cars.
A

20
21

That is correct, and at that time, he said to

That is right.

He recounted — he recounted

incidents at which violence occurred, but throughout the
record, we have these petitions, telling the crowd, “Look,
don't involve yourself in violence? that has happened to us
before..

That is what they want to have happen here, and we

exhort you against it."1
8

The county put on evidence that at the rally were

1

2

200 people, that there was an ample police force, that the

3

Negroes were clearly disturbed and angry, but they did not so

4

much as even mingle with the whites.
There was evidence over the objection of counsel of

5
6

1964 Riots that had followed sit-in, not pure speech.

There

7

was evidence that there was racial peace before and since.

3

There was also evidence of cooperation between petitioners and

9

the authorities.

10

One of petitioners, for example, inquired about the

11

use of a public address system, and about general sponsorship

12

of a rally.

13

did request that there be no mention of the cases, and as the

14

Justice has pointed out, there was no mention, although there

15

was mention of the 1933 case.
Q

1G
17

Captain Randall, one of the officers present,

Was I right in understanding that that case had

led to a lynching?
A

13

That case indeed led to a lynching, and these

19

petitioners noted that at that time, there was shame passed

20

on Princess Anne, but that they didn't feel, but Princess Anne

21

apparently didn't feel at that time that that was shameful

22

conduct.
Q

23
24
25

It was the opposite.

They put stickers on their

cars saying they were proud to be Easterners, right after the
lynching.
9

1

A

2

These petitioners did relate to this audience by

3

reminding them that they had participated in activity that

4

might be also considered to be racist,- although these petition­

3

ers did not in fact exhort them to participate in such activity

8

at the present time.

7

That is right.

The court refused to hand down an immediate opinion

3

or even a ruling, because it wanted to see a transcript first.

0

Twerty-three days later, a permanent 10-month injunction issued,

effectively continuing in force the temporary injunction.
Since then, a sound equipment statute, arguedly bad
under Sale versus New York, has been passed by the county.

The

Court of Appeals of Maryland disapproved neither injunction.
However, it held that the 10-month injunction was too long.
Of the 10-day ex parte temporary injunction, the
Court of Appeals said the court was correct in issuing its
order, dated August 7, 1966.
If the Justices please, I would like to deal with the
moctness questions first.
This court has kindly given some time to trial
counsel, co-counsel here, Mr. 2inman in order that he might
relate some of the factual circumstances that might clear up
this issue somewhat more.

He will take five minutes to do

that, when I have finished.
We believe that this case is not moot.

10

Because we

1

believe we come within two exceptions.

exception, a.nd the other a procedural exception.

4

One, a substantive

This court has always recognised exceptions to the
mootness requirements.

5

We cite a law review article by Diamond, generally,

0

in our brief.

In that, in the course of that article, there

7

is a summary of one of the exceptions to mootness, which we

8

feel we fall within.
It bears perhaps quoting here, it is short.

9

"Although the controlling fact situation may be so

10

It

changed that the specific relief sought is no longer possible,

12

if the situation is self-perpetuating, the parties are entitled

13

to adjudication which will apply to the renewed phase of the

14

controversy in existence.

We believe that this controversy
These petitioners have been

We have cited in our brief the South Pacific Case,

10
19

where Southern Pacific Case, excuse me, where this court said that

20

short-term orders capable of repetition will not defeat a claim

21

for mootness.

22

which we think point up the difference between moot claims

23

and nonmoot claims.
One is oil workers, where the court found mootness

24
25

We have cited two other cases in our brief,

to exist.

The other is motor coach, where the court found no

1.1

1

mootness to exist.

In both cases, the Governor's

seizure

2

of public utility was at issue,, and the Governor had returned

3

the property.

4

The difference was that the underlying factual dis­

5

pute was px'esent in one case, in motor coach, and not present

6

in the other.

7

which had ended in the one case, and which continued in the

3

other o

That underlying factual dispute was a strike

9

We think that the Sideburn Case, decided last term

10

by this court, also points up a kind of exception this court

11

will take to normal mootness claims.

12

There it is pointed up that failures in State pro­

13

cedure will not be allowed as a cause for mootness.

14

think that there are specific failures of State procedure

15

here which this court in Friedman versus Maryland has already

1G

analyzed and condemned.

17

That we

13

20

New York procedure.

21

22
oo

24
25

It compared Maryland procedure with

Under New York procedure — under Maryland procedure,
it found that the statute talked about prompt administrative
determination, but it said that there was no assurance of
prompt judicial review, and this court didn't really know how
prompt administrative determination had to be.
12

i

In New York, on the other hand, there is clear,

2

definite language about time limits, this court said»

3

example, a judge had to, in New York, hand down his opinion

4

within two days after a matter was heard»

5

For

That kind of time limit saved the censorship statute

6

in New York, and didn’t save censorship in Maryland, and

7

we submit that in this case we have that kind of situation.

8
9

Moreover, Walker versus Birmingham is procedurally
relevant here, because the court there criticized petitioners

10

for making no efforts to challenge the injunction there, and

11

the court gave every indication that if petitioners had made

12

efforts and if petitioners had met with delay, this court would

13
14

have decided the case.
Yet I believe that that case could not have gotten to

15

this court, either, before it became moot, for the demonstra­

16

tion was hoped to be held on an Easter Sunday, and the injunc­

17
18

tion was issued some two or three days beforehand, and even under
Alabama procedure, they could not have gotten here, so I think

ID

there is an indication in the opinions that this court would

20

have decided that ex parte temporary injunction case, because

21

22
23
24
25

it related to free speech.
Q

I don’t think the indication was that the case

c mid have gotten here in time, in the Walker against Birmingham,
but rather if the petitioners had gone to the trial court in
Alabama, and had been met with a rebuff or a delay, and then
13

1

proceeded to hold their parade, the case would have been pre­

2

sented here ultimately in quite a different posture.

3

A

That is possible, your Honor, but another pro­

4

cedure would have been just as open to them would have been

5

to somehow seek appeal here.

6

as to whether or not to violate the injunction then or not.

7

It certainly is worth nothing that this court, in

They would have been uncertain

3

Walker and Birmingham, expressed considerable doubt as to the

9

injunction and statute involved, even though it didn’t have to

TO

decide that question, because it was a First Amendment case,

n

and it had an ex parte injunction in it.

12

We believe that these procedural and sxibstantive

13

reasons which are applicable to cases generally apply here,

14

but we believe this case has another important part to it, and

15

that is that there is an ex;

?G

Amendment case, and we believe that the supremacy clause means

17

that this court ought not let that ex parte injunction stand,

18

as law and rule of the First Amendment.

19

parte injunction here in a First

Indeed, even when speech is not involved, equity will

20

normally not enjoin the commission of a criminal act, but when

21

speech is involved, it would seem all the more inappropriate.

22

The court below, it should be noted, expressly

23

approved the ex parte injunction here, though it had run, by

24

the time it got to the Court of Appeals, and we think this

25

court can do the same.
14

We would like to spend a few minutes on the injunc­

1

2

tions themselves.
Q

3
4

Did your client make any effort to review the

ex parte injunction?
A

5

Yes, they did, although not before the answer

6

date.

We have submitted a reply brief, in which we have shown

7

that the petitioners could not secure counsel in time to

8

force hearing before they did.
Had they related to do so, they would have done so,

9
10

as soon as they secured counsel, they did, in fact, file an

11

answer

12

We have asked this court to do two things with re­

13

spect to these injunctions.

14

the injunctive process to control speech, and No. 2, we have

15

argued that these injunctions, in any case, were improper,

16

because the evidence as finally submitted did not show that an

17
13
19
20
21

22

23
24
25

No. 1, to disapprove the use of

uncontrollable situation was bound to result from the next rally
The disapproval of the injunctive process, we think,
is necessary, and would only repeat what this court has done
in the permit cases.

We don’t need to tell this court that a

prior restraint is the essence of what the First Amendment bars,
so much so that this court has rarely had before it a speech
that has been enjoined.
Q

There were no ordinances or statutes involved

here, were there, involving permits for a meeting?
15

1

2

A

That is right, your Honor, there was nothing

in existence at the time.

3

Q

There were none?

4

A

That is right, at that time.

5

This court, in permit cases, has always looked to see

6

whether or not the permit went beyond mere ministerial per­

7

mission, ordering that mere ministerial permission be given to

3

give speeches.

9

What we think that means is that this court has said

10

in speech cases, there shall be no prior restraint.

11

are asking this court to do is do the same thing in the context

12

of an ex parte injunction.

13

14
15
16
17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

All we

We think there is another reason why this court should
disapprove the use of the ex parte injunction, is because we
believe this court has said, whenever it has used any free
speech test, that the State must use a constitutional way to
reach its legitimate end.
Now we certainly regard the end here as legitimate.
Here the end is control of disorder.

But disorder can be

controlled without the menacing, without the broad, without the
unusual ex parte temporary injunction.
This has been said in this court time immorial.
Q

Mrs. Norton, I am a little troubled by the

procedural aspects of this case.

Actually, what happened here

was that an ex parte injunction was issued, and then later on,
16

1

an ex parte injunction was issued to restrain the petitioners

2

from holding a meeting in 10 days.

3

an interlocutory, some sort of an interlocutory order entered

4

to restrain petitioners for ten months?

5

A

6

Q

7

as if what we

8

order.

Then later on, there was

That is right.
Mow did that, now but you are arguing this case
have before us is the ex parte order.

The first

Was the second order ex parte, also?

9

A

Mo, the second order was not ex parte.

10

Q

Why is it referred to in the papers that we have

11

before us here as an interlocutory order?

It. went to the

12

Maryland — then an appeal was taken to the Maryland Court of

13

Appeals, wasn’t it?

14

A

Yes, that is local terminology.

15

Q

All right, but — and you make no point of that,

16

and your adversary makes no point of that?

17

A

That is right.

10

Q

So then there was an appeal taken to the Maryland

19

Court of Appeals.

Is that right?

20

A

That is right, sir.

21

Q

And didn’t the Maryland Court of Appeals indi­

22
23
24
25

cate in some way that the ex parte order was invalid?
A

No, it did net.

It expressly indicated that the

ex parte order had been valid.
Q

And how about the next order, the 10-month order?
17

1
2

A

because it was for too long a period of time.
Q

3
4

The 10-month order, it said, was invalud only

Well now, so that what we have before us, in

your submission, is only the ex parte order?

5

A

Technically that is true, your Honor.

6

Q

And that ex parte order enjoined a particular,

7

enjoined defendants from holding a particular proposed meeting?

8

Is that right?
A

D
to

Wot only a particular proposed meeting, but any

meeting that might have been held for those 10 days, your Honor.

11

Q

For 10 days only?

12

A

Yes.

13

Q

And we don't have before us the subsequent

14

order which was a 10-month order?
A

15

Technically we do not, because technically it

10

18

Well, that eliminates the reason why I have

19

considerable procedural difficulty with this case, Now, also,

as I understand it, somewhere in these papers, the petitioners

Now what bearing, what is your view as to whether

those events have a bearing upon our jurisdictional and pro­

cedural problems?

Well, we believe that that subsequent appli­

10

The one that was granted was

granted only if petitioners agreed not to give a speech of the

12

kind they gave on August 6th.

Now is that before us?

Is that in the record?

14

Are the precise terms of that permit in the record, has it been

15

litigated below?

16

A

17

Q

Is it before us in the record?

A

It is not before us in the record as a cause of

10

19

action.

It has not been litigated below.

It is only there to demonstrate —-

20

Q

But how is it there?

21

A

We brought it to this court's attention.

22

Q

How?

23

Only to show.

24
25

What is the physical form?

In the form of letters, in the

appendix of our petition for certiorari.
Q

Is there a formal permit that is reprinted in

the appendix?
A

2

In the reply brief there is a statute since

passed, printed, which requires a permit, in order to use sound

equipment.

That is all we have before us.

But you don't

have the specific text of the permit that you say was granted

Q

I notice, Mrs. Norton, that you reserved some

time for Mr. Zinman.

You are going to have to stay within your

half hour, so if you are going ahead, you have less than five
minutes now, if you want to take it all, Mr. Zinman will have
no time.
A

All right, I will give him five minutes.

Q

Very well.

A

And thank you for calling that to my attention.

Q

Very well, Mr. Zinman.

MR. ZINMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the
20

1

court, I will address my remarks specifically to some of the

2

procedures to which Justice Fortas referred.
While within the context actually of the the Freedman

3

I

4

Case in which we would urge a speedy determination from the

5

lowest court, the Court of Appeals, Maryland,
The ex parte injunction was issued, of course, on the

6
7

affidavit of Commissioner DuShield, who the record disclosed

8

didn’t actually observe the rally for more than five minutes'

9

time, nor does the record indicate that the court actually

10

hear the tape and the order, of course, continued for 10 days.
Now within that period of time, oh, and this order,

11

12
13
14
15
16

this ex parte order, the record indicates, was not served upon
Stoner, Brailsford, Norton, nor the National States Rights Party
It

was, however, served on three of the petitioners, so that

actually there are three people that never even got served as
a process.
Now ultimately when I got into the case, on the 15th

17
18
19

20

of August, I did file a general answer, but, of course, the
hearing was scheduled for the 17th, which actually gave us only
two days.
Now under the Maryland rules of procedure, you do

21

22

23
24
25

have tv/o days within which to request a hearing for an ex parte
order.

However, in this particular case, we filed affidavits

to the effect that the petitioners did attempt to contact two
lawyers, and failing that, and also there is a letter in the
21

1

record which 1 sent as soon as 1 got into the case to the

2

President of the Ear Association of Somrnerset County, Mr. Jones,

3

requesting that local counsel be assigned to assist us.

4

Because, No. 1, the distance from Baltimore, Maryland,

5

from my office to Somrnerset County is 150 miles, it takes a

6

day to get up and back, and secondly, I wasn't altogether

7

familiar with local practice.

8

Of course I got back a letter indicating that this was

3

an unpopular cause, that half of the bar association, consisting

10

of seven, were on the other side of the case, and that in any

11

event, nobody wanted the case.

12

Consequently, there wasn't any real remedy that these

13

petitioners had.

And we had, for all intents and purposes,

14

addressed ourselves to the permanent injunction, and the hearing

15

which, of course, came later.

16

Now in connection with our argument under Freedman

17

that we would like a prompt and expeditious determination, I

10

would suggest that even though technically the

19

20

interlocutory

or permanent injunction is not before the court, from a practica 1
standpoint, this injunction continued in effect from the date

21

of its inception, the date of the ex parte order, which was on

22

the 7th, until June the 7th, 1967, when the Court of Appeals

23

finally rendered its decision.

24
25

During the interim period, 1 would like this court
to understand that 1 made certainly every effort to, No. 1,

22

1

expedite the case according to the Maryland Rules of Procedures,

2

by initially trying to shorten the time for transmission of

3

the record, by filing a motion to shorten the time within which

4

argument was to be held, and even by sending a letter to the

5

Court of Appeals of Maryland, which is part of the record,

6

requesting them to render an expeditious decision.
So from a practical standpoint, the defendants were

7

8

enjoined for almost nine months, and I think that we would like

9

a ruling to the effect that a determination of this kind,

10

involving speech and involving assembly, should be handled in

11

the same way that censorship cases are handled.
That is, they should be able to get from the Court

12
13

of lowest instance, to the highest

14

short period of time.

15

Q

court in the State, in a

I gather the 10-month period was chosen by the

16

court because that would cover the academic year of Maryland

Is that right?

Which is a predominantly Negro institution, is

A

Yes, which school wasn't open at the time.

No, but it was going to open in September, and

20

Yes.

I

it not?

23

the academic year would last until the following June, is that

24

right?

25

A

Your Honor, I think that I would interpret that

23

1

by inference to mean that if the injunction had been for nine

2

months, it would have been perfectly proper.

3

is my interpretation, because ■—Q

Of course, that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF S. LEONARD ROTTMAN, ESQ.

15

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. ROTTMAN:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

17

court.

I would like to first point out that there are a great

10

deal of matters which are in the Appendix in this case,

10

in the supplemental brief, which are not part of the record in

20

this case.

and

They were matters involving the issuance of the

21

22

subsequent petition, the attempt to obtain trial counsel, other

23

such items.

24

submit.

25

Q

They are not properly before this court, we would

Mr. Rottman, may I just suggest to you, before
24

1

you get into your argument, that we have done in this case

2

what we don’t usually do.

3

both sides to allow two lawyers to talk.

We have acceded to the request of

4

A

Yes, sir.

5

Q

And the reason we don't do that, normally, is

6

because we run over, and don’t keep our cases within the

7

calendar, and I just suggest to you that if you want time for

3

Mr. Jones, that you do what I suggested on the other side.

9

A

1 will do so, sir.

10

Q

Keep within bounds.

11

A

12

13

With that in mind, I would like to comment very

briefly on the issue of mootness.

And it would seem to us,

and we submit, that any decision that this court may make in

14

this particular case would be moot, and would operate purely

15

in a vacuum.

1G
17
13
19
20

21
22

23
24
25

And therefore, the case is moot, and should not be
considered by the court upon the merits.
Q

Now I would, speaking only for myself, would

suppose that you might well argue that under all conventional
and traditional and normal tests this case is moot.

This was

a 10-day injunction, more than two years ago.
A

Yes, sir.

Q

That the 10-days expired more than two years ago.

And nobody is now hurt, so far as this record shows.

Nobody

was ever sent to prison, nor even fined, or anything like that.
25

1

But what does this allow the State to do?

2

tonight a court enjoins Hubert Humphrey for holding a meeting

3

in a community where he wants to hold a meeting tonight, for

4

10-days, and suppose he couldn!t get that decided until after

5

November 5th.

6

A

I think this, your Honor:

Suppose

I think that under

7

the Maryland rules, there is an absolute right to a hearing

9

with two day's notice.

9

These petitioners did not avail themselves of that.

10

They say they had difficulty getting counsel, and yet one of

11

their petitioners, Mr. Stoner, is an attorney, and had only the

12

preceding week appeared in Baltimore for a similar case in

13

which the National States Rights Party was enjoined.

14

He appeared and represented them in that case.

15

I would say there is an absolute right to a two-day

1G

hearing on the injunction.

i7

court, it seems to me that the test is, the quickness with

10

which you get a judicial review.

19

And under the decisions of this

The first instance of a court reviewing the right of

20

the restraint on speech, and Maryland has specifically provided

21

the two-day test, two-day hearing, they can have it on that.

22

Q

Two-day notice of hearing.

23

A

No, sir, they can have a hearing on not less than

24

two day's notice.

25

it within two days.

So, if they request a hearing, they must have
I believe that is the interpretation that
26

1

has consistently been given in Maryland, and that is the way

2

the rule reads.
Q

3
4

Do you have the Maryland cases cited in your

brief, the authorities, because that is not the way I read it.
A

5

No, I have no Maryland cases, your Honor; I have

Q

a reference to the Maryland rule.

7

that rule.

1 know the application of

3

Q

How does the rule read?

9

A

The rule reads that a party has an absolute

10

right to a hearing on two day's notice, on the issuance of an

11

ex parte injunction, and the practice in Maryland, Miss Norton

12

says that it is an unusual practice to issue a temporary

13

injunction, I would submit that that is not so, your Honor.
I have only been at the bar some ten years now, but

14
15

I have been involved, and I am not particularly do a great deal

1G

of trial work, but I have been involved in probably no less

17

than five, in my own experience, ex parte injunction.
The Maryland courts uniformly grant a hearing on two

18

day's notice, on application of one of the parties.

20

Q

21

could have done that?

25

Were all these people served in time so they

They may not have been served, your Honor, but

4

they were all very much aware of the injunction.

We believe that -—-

Q

Now they

Does Maryland contend here that the temporary

ex parte injunction was not at issue?

3

A

Absolutely.

9

Q

And at least, your highest court said that it

10

was a proper injunction?
A

11

Yes, sir, they said that the existence of a

12

clear and present danger of a riot in the streets of Princess

13

Anne--

14

Q

So this is an interpretation by the Maryland

15

courts, by the highest court in Maryland, as to what kind of

16

conduct the meeting would justify an .injunction, as a threat

17

to the public order?

10

A

I believe you could say that; yes, sir.

19

Q

So there is an interpretation of the First

20

Amendment, or the Maryland law, as being permissible to the

21

First Amendment, which now obtains in Maryland, and which

22

people who want to hold meetings must observe, unless they want

23

to be subject to an injunction.

24
25

A

I believe that is so, your Honor, but I don't

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Rottman, you may

continue your argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF S. LEONARD ROTTMAN, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

6

(Resumed)

1
8

MR. ROTTMAN%

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

Justice White, in answer to your inquiry, I would say

SO

that the answer is that it is moot because the injunction was

t!

issued in the context of a specific factual situation, which

12

may never exist again.

13

Q

I know, but the ruling under the Maryland law,

14

meetings may be stopped by an injunction, consistently with

15

the First Amendment, is an ongoing, that is just the rule of

16

law, now.

17

law has been and will be interpreted.

18

I don’t suppose, than if there were a statute in Maryland that

19

says under certain circumstances, meetings may be enjoined, and

20

people who want to hold meetings bring a declaratory judgment

21

action, in challenging that statute, and the statute is upheld.

22
23
24
25

And that is the way the First Amendment in Maryland

Q

It isn't any different,

No one would suggest that the case is moot just

because there weren't any meetings involved at the present time.
A

Well, I would suggest that that lav;, as you

pointed out, sir, is the lav? ever since Milk Wagon Drivers Unior

Q

2

Now you are just arguing as to the correctness

of the rules.

4

A

Yes, sir,

5

Q

Then as to mootness, I mean, we may agree with

6

the? Maryland court; we may, but that doesn't mean the issue

7

is moot.

8

isn’t moot. I just suggest that to you.

It may be, and maybe the ruling is correct, but it

A

9

Well, it seems to me that if the issue is to

10

come before this court on this injunction, and in this context,

11

that the way to get it before the court is to allow the

12

petitioners to violate the injunction, and subject themselves

13

to the contempt penalties and bring it up in that factual

14

situation, because if this court has to pronounce a rule, as

22

24
25

to whether it will consider all cases not moot, and not follow
its general principles of only considering live cases, as
against —
Q

If they violate the injunction, as this court

said, that they can be imprisoned for it, if they^ should have
gone into the courts to vindicate their rights, why would
they violate it?
A
Your Honor.

I don’t think that that is the pronouncement in
I think this court went a good deal out of its

way in Walker to point out that the petitioners in that case
had taken no steps; they had taken no steps to contest the
31

S

1

issuance of the injunction, and the court made it very clear,

2

I think, that they were clearly put on notice that they could

3

not bypass orderly judicial review of the injunction before

4

disobeying, and I think what that case does is recognize that

5

you must first, in the initial instance, object to the issuance

6

of the injunction.

7

object to it, and if it may run out before you have time to

8

follow through, all the way to this court, if you will, then

9

you have the right to protest the issuance of the injunction,

If it is then issued, and if you may then

10

and if the injunction is wrongly issued, their conviction

u

under it would be reversed,

12

Q

Well, supposing on this temporary restraining

13

order they had gone to the court within two days afterwards,

14

and the lower court had decided against them. Could they then

15

violate it, and come to this court?

16

h

1 don't mean to say that they could violate it

17

with impunity, but I think the way to get it before this court

18

in a live issue, and not a moot issue, would be to violate it.

19

If the balancing of the equities must be between the protection 1

20

of the State, in holding safe its streets, by allowing them

2?

to issue injunctions, or if it is to force petitioners and

22

those in their position to test injunctions in a live issue,

23
24
25

by contesting it, and subjecting themselves to criminal
penalties, I would say that the better rule would be to

force

them to take the burden of criminal punishment, rather than

32

I

to force the State to take the burden of allowing their streets

2

to be the subject of rioting over any issue that speakers may

3

wish to make.

4

Q

Then I take it your position on mootness to be

5

the same whether or not the Court of Appeals had disapproved

6

the ten months injunctione

7

A

Had approved?

8

Q

Let's assume that it had approved both

0

injunctions? the temporary injunction and the ten months

10

injunction.

11

A

Yes? it would basically be the same.

12

Q

Your position would be the same? even though the

13

Maryland court had made this kind of a ruling?

14

A

Yes? sir? because it seems to us that the hold­

15

ing in Freedman was? and the thinking in Freedman, expressed

16

by this court is that it is the initial judicial review that is

17

important.

18

appellate reviews? as before this very court.

19

20
21

It is not carrying all the way through? to the

Q

That may be so, as a procedural matter, but if

we are just talking mootness? why? it is a different slant on it,
A

Well? it is our position that this case, in this

22

context, is moot.

If you do want to consider this case, how­

23

ever? on the merits of it? and we will go on to discuss that,

24

if you will? the principal issue before this court on the

25

merits of the case? as we see it? ±3 the right of a State to
33

1

2
3

ever act to prevent certain classes of speech,
Q

Before you get into that, one more question on

the mootness.

4

A

Yes, sir,

5

Q

Was the issue of mootness argued before the

6
7

a

Maryland Court of Appeals?
A

I believe not.

Of course the ten-point injunctiojn,

what was called the interlocutory injunction, that was not moot

9

Q

That was still in effect.

10

A

At the time, that was still in effect.

11

The reversal was passed by the Maryland Court of

12

Appeals prior to the expiration of that interlocutory injunction

13

Q

14

A

1 see.
By the way, I may say that I think the term

15

"interlocutory" is simply used to distinguish it from a

16

personal injunction.

17

a final order, but it was a final temporary, in effect, that

18

it expired within a given period of time.

On the grounds that it was extended for too long

Q

But the Maryland Court of Appeals did hold that

2

a period.

the Ex Parte Order was properly issued.

6

A

That is correct.

7

Q

And in doing so, it seems to have addressed

8

itself readily to the operation of the Ex Parte Order, with

9

respect to the enjoining of the meeting that was to be held

10

the night following the night on which these utterances were

11

made.

12

A

Yes, sir.

13

Q

And it said that what happened here, according

14

to the Maryland Court of Appeals, as 1 read it, was that on

15

the first night, the stage was set for what the police regarded

16

as an inflammatory or violent situation on the following night.

17

A

That is correct.

18

Q

And I don81 see anything in here further along

19

the lines that my brother* Stewart said; I see nothing in the

20

Maryland Court of Appeals opinion with respect to the mootness

21

at this point.

Is that right?

22

A

That is right.

They did not consider it.

23,-

We would suggest that the Maryland Court of Appeals

24

affirmed this position on the issuance of the existence of a

25

clear and present danger at the time the temporary 10-day
35

injunction was issued»

As of tomorrow if the same court issued the same

injunction against the same petitioner?

Could they?

It would depend, I submit, on the background

Do you suppose the tapes read almost exactly

I don't know that the tapes are particularly —■

12

they are important, because they are the words that helped

13

create the clear and present danger, but there was a background

14

of violence which was also significant at the time of this

citizens, so that their constitutional rights may be protected

by preventing violent speech, and forcing the people who wish

to stretch the limits of their right to violating an injunction j

7

on those who wish to stretch their right of free speech, because;

State may not by injunctive action prevent speech, even speech
which will create a clear and present danger, which will
create an absolute riot, as these petitioners did in Baltimore
City, that you are of necessity saying that you are going to
deprive other citizens of their constitutional rights, of beingsafe and secure in their person and property.

Because this

court has pronounced on many occasions that there is speech
which creates violence.

Speech sets off the motor equipment

that is violence, and when that violence is set loose, then
other citizens are denied their rights.
Witness the incidents that happened in Baltimore City
whenevter these petitioners spoke, before they were enjoined
in Baltimore City, an innocent 12-year-old boy was walking
down the street near Patterson Park, with his dog, a Negro boy,
had nothing to do with the rallies, he i^as three blocks from
the reallying and the crowd from the rallies just swept up
and beat him, they put a rope around his neck, and if it hadn’t
41

1

been for prompt police actions, he would have been deprived of

2

his ultimate civil liberty»
Now if you. are not going to permit the State courts to

3
4

enjoin this kind of speech, which will set off that, then you

5

have not to recognize that you are granting someone else the

6

right to exercise or abuse his constitutional privilege at the

7

expense of denying this to other citizens.
Q

13

A

Yes, it goes to the merits of the issue.

14

Q

Because in terms of the procedural problem that

15

is bothering some of us, I don't see that it has got much to

16

do with it.

17

that the Maryland Court of Appeals reversed the 10-month order,

18

and then without talking about mootness, it addressed itself

19

to a 10-day order, which was in practical effect a 1-day order,

20

and then the question is, has the Maryland Court of Appeals no**

21

made some decision, effective decision which has a First Amend­

22

ment effect of which we can take cognizance within our

23

constitutional limitations?

The procedural problem that bothers me here is

That's the problem, s

I see it.

24

25

lower courts in Maryland can issue injunctions, as they have

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

The ironies inherent in this case, Your Honors, are too

numerous and too striking to bear further comment. I would like
to restrict my remarks to the clear and present danger as it
existed in Princess Anne in August of 1966.

This was summarised

by Judge Finan, who wrote the Unanimous Opinion of the Court
of Appeals in Maryland in this case, at page 122 of the
Appendix.

What clear and present danger test do you want

to talk about?

but with the realization that they were in the nature of a

10

harangue, delivered in the humidity of a torrid August night

from the Court House steps of the County Seat, whose people were

12

not strangers to racial violence*"

13

We urge that this rally, held on August 6th, must be

14

viewed in the light of existing circumstances, and that the

15

appellants, by their own vjords, must be regarded as highly

dangerous, racial and religious bigots, deliberately operating

of Princess Anne, to its eternal shame, first gained notoriety
as the scene of Maryland's last lynching in 1933, a fact which
was not lost upon the appellants»

locale of serious racial disturbances in February of 1964.

This was August of 19S6?

There have been racial incidents

since that time»

4

the town attorney for this community, if these people appeared

5

tomorrow, I would seek a similar injunction for exactly the

6

same reasons»

1
S
9

Q

And under the rule established by the Maryland

Court of Appeals, you ought to get it.
A

Yes, sir, I hope so»

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

M

Q

Was the proceeding based on any statute?

12

A

No, sir.

13

There was no ordinance in the community,

and no state lav? involved.

14

Q

What was the threat?

15

A

The threat was at any moment, that whole town

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

and county could blow up, as it had done in the past.
Q

Well, I suppose there is a statute against it

in that town.
A

Yes, sir, but it would have been a bit late.

Q

I understand that.

I just say, though, there

was a statute against it.
A

Against malicious destruction.

Q

Were the people violating any law by holding

the meeting?
A

They had not violated any town ordinance, as such,
48

1

Mr. Justice.

We had no requirements as to loudspeakers or

2

assemblies, or anything of that nature.

3

Q

What about your streets?

But your injunction was not based on the blocking

of the streets?

that to this mixed audience,

19

and in this place, a riot could well have developed, that it

20

was imminent.

2?
22

Q

in this community at this time,

Were there any local ordinances or statutes

directly involved?

23

A

No, Your Honor.

24

Q

To form the basis for this?

25

A

No.
49

1

Q

This was a judicially fashioned remedy, in a

2

particular situation?
A Yes, sir, the town commissioners and the county

3
4

commissioners approached the court with a hastily drav/n peti­

3

tion, signing an injunction.,

6

Q

But under no ordinance or statute?

7

A

No, simply that it constituted a threat to the

8

general welfare, health and safety of the inhabitants of the

9

town.
Q

10

I gather the officers had no difficulty in

preventing violence?

11

A

12

Their physical presence, sir, in considerable

13

numbers, according to Captain Randall, was the only thing that

14

prevented the riots.
Q

15

The statement is that that prejudiced their

right to hold a meeting the following night?

16

A

17

The situation by that time, Mr. Justice, could

have become so polarised and so inflamed that there were not

18
19

enough State Police in the State of Maryland to control it,

20

and that is Colonel Davidson's testimony as well.
Q

21

I notice that your permanent injunction, or your j
j'

10-month injunction is considerably narrower than the temporary,!

22

the Ex Parte Restraining Order.

23

A

24

Yes, sir, the 10-raonth injunction as Mr. Justice

Stewrart indicated, coincided with the school term of Maryland

25

i

50

1

State College,

2
3

Q

But it was narrower in the kind of meeting that

it prevented?

4

A

Yes, sir,

5

Q

I suppose this party could have gone on and had

6

meetings under this 10-month injunction?

7

A

The second injunction, as you indicate, wass

8

narrower in that, it restrained them from carrying on meetings

9

of such a nature which would tend to invite racial strife.

10

Q

What is your justification for the temporary

11

restraining order, where it enjoined all meetings, whether they

12

would incite racial violence or not?

13
14

Simply because the situation was so inflammatory \
/
at the time that almost any assembly of persons immediately

15

set off rumors, counterrumors, and drew others to the scene.

A

The ten months injunction, in fact, was not requested I;

16
17

by us.

This was entered by the court on its own initiative.

18

The request for ten months was never asked —
