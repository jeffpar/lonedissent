MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN L. WEISL, JR.

MR. WEISL:

These two cases are here on writs of Certiorari to

In each of them the United States seeks reversal of
judgments of that court granting back pay to former service­

12

15

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justices, may it pleas

the United States Court of Claims.

1C

14

Mr. Welsl, you may proceed

with your argument.

6

13

Counsel are present.

j

men each of whom had been discharged from the service pursuant
to judgments of conviction of Court-Martial.
In each of these cases the United States urges that

15

the Court of Claims lacks power to, in effect, constitute itself

17

an additional appellate tribunal to review Courts-Martial for

18

errors of law and therefore their judgment should be reversed.

19
20
21

i

Beyond the common question of law neither of these
cases has anything in common.
In Augenbliek we have a conviction of a naval officer
i

22

for the commission of an "indecent, lewd and lascivious act",

23

in Juhl, the conviction of black market activities.

24

In Augenbliek the Court of Claims In effect reversed

25

the Court-Martial conviction and granted back pay because of a

3

I

i

purported Jencks Act question.

In Juhl the Court of Claims

2

purported to reverse a Court-Martial conviction and award back

3

pajf because of a question of a conviction of Juhl on what the

4

Court of Claims said was "self-contradictorys uncorroborated

5

accomplice testimony" — in other words a mere evidentiary

6

question.
The state sa.ys that the Court of Claims lacks power

7

S

to do this, that the finality provisions of the Uniform Code of

9

Military Justice providing for review of Courts-Martial

10

ultimately by the Court of Military Appeals bars the Court of

11

Claims from reviewing once again these judgments of conviction

12

for factual Jencks Act questions and the like,, but that even if

13

this Court finds the Court of Claims has some measure of power

14

to review Courts-Martial, no matter whether that power be broad j

15

or narrow, the Court of Claims was in error here.

16
17
18

Q,

Does the Court of Claims judgment, assuming it has

jurisdiction, intend to reinstate this man?

A.

No, sir; I believe their only power is to award back

19

pay, but I think that clearly the effect is to reverse the

20

conviction.

21

review of records, military records, would then re-lnstate the

22

man and wipe out the conviction utterly.

I am not certain whether or not a board for the

They were both dismissed, sir.

The Court of Military Appeals denied review in the

AugenbXick case.

Was there an effort to get Juhl a review?

Juhl was not entitled to such review because his

conviction was for less than 3ix months, or was for six months,

Court of Military Appeals.

10

Q,

Within the services?

A.

Within the services, Indeed.

There are constituted

■

12

within each service boards of review that by statute, recent

13

statutes have been elevated to the title of Courts of Military

14

Review or Appeal, consisting of Judge Advocate General officers

15

and or civilians, which have a very large degree of independence

and freedom from influence by the command.
Certainly when you think that the purpose of

21

Courts-Martial are disiplinary —

,

0

Did these two cases go to such boards?

A.

Juhl cases again, because of the shortness of the

conviction, did not reach such a board, but it was reviewed by

l

22
23
24
25

the convening authority of the court and somewhat up through
the chain of command.
Each of them has staff Judge Advocates to advise them
on questions of law and fact.

6

It may be irrelevant, but I think

there has been a high degree of scrupulousness to protect
2

rights of defendants in the Courts-Martial»

3

can well take into account the fact that none of these Judge

4

Advocates are young lawyers —

5

Q,

I think this Court

If actually there has been a serious defect in this

6

Court-Martial3 even a constitutional one, in Augenblick, since

7

he could not go to habeas, I gather, and the Court of Military

8

Appeals as here had denied it, even though there is a serious

9

constitutional defect in his Court-Martial conviction, no

10
11

court can do anything about it.
A

I would say that is my position and in Augenblick I

12

say this is not a harsh one because the Court of Military

13

Appeals could have presented to it any constitutional issue

14

and if there were a substantial one I submit —

15
16

Q

We might think it substantial and they might not and

refuse to review.

Is that not so?

17

A

I am sure it is possible that this Court and --

18

Q,

They might refuse to review.

!9

A

Yes.

20

Q

And we could not reach them.

21

A

That is correct.

22

Q,

Let us assume, Mr. Weisl, that all of the proceedings 1

23

were had in the Courts of Military Justice and there were no

24

questions about them, your position has to be that when the

25

defendant in the criminal case before the Military Courts files

7

\

an action for back pay in the Court of Claims , a separate

2

jurisprudential system, that that court cannot then go into any

3

questions at all?

4

A.

I believe this is the sounder conclusion.,

We suggest

5

in our brief, and I am prepared to argue that at times a

6

broader scope of review has been considered by this Court and

7

at other times the Court of Claims has assumed that power

8

without having an appeal taken to this Court.

9

Q

Let us suppose that the Court of Claims discovers or

10

concludes that the Military Courts had no jurisdiction over the

11

offense charged and that therefore the soldier was wrongly

12

separated from the service, on a jurisdictional ground.

13

that be open to the Court of Claims?

14

A.

I suggest that there is no need for that.

Would

The

15

question is really before this Court for the first time here

16

and I suggest that the Court of Claims need not, in fairness to

17

persons accused, have that jurisdiction now.

18

they have exercised it though.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q,

I will say that

I am asking you about your theory, the theory of the

United States.

Is it the theory of the United States that in

a subsequent suit for back pay the Court of Claims should be
precluded from inquiring into the jurisdiction of the Military
Courts with respect to the person and the offense charged?
A.

It is our theory, it is.

We concede, however, that

the Court of Claims has in the past assumed the power to look

8

at the jurisdiction and cite in poin2 of our brief a couple of
cases where they did that very thing.

They realized that the

court was improperly constituted, did not have the proper
officers sitting on it, and they granted back pay.
I submit that what Congress has done to protect the
accused, providing, I think a

veryelaborate and adequate

system of review, there is no

needfor the Court of Claims to -

It seems to me that

the service or whatever it may be.
remedies provided by law.

I want to exhaust my

I want to resort to my remedies

provided by lav/ for the recovery of back pay."
Then he files an action in the Court of Claims.
I take It now that your position is that regardless
of the alleged defect, even if It Is a jurisdictional defect in
the military tribunal, the position of the United States is that
the Court of Claims is precluded from going into that?
A.

We really feel, Mr. Justice Portas, that there is a

statute, a Congressional act, which was embodied in Article 76
of the SCMJ that has made the review within the Court-Martial
military system final and conclusive.
/

We think that It Is adequate to protect defendants
! against improperly constituted tribunals.

Therefore, the

Court of Claims is precluded from doing this.

9
I

I understand the Court’s difficulty and the problem

*

2

with it, but I am not sure one is really tilting at windmills

3

these days when there is a true, adequate and largely civilian

4

review of Court-Martial.

S

in the service today, as I think this Court well knows, are

6

civilian-oriented people who are serving a brief time in the

7

military service in order to satisfy their obligation.

Most of the Judge Advocate officers

They are jealous guardians of the rights of defendants

8

The Court of Military Appeals record of reversal of convictions

9
10

is astoundingly high.

11

civilian court that reviews criminal eases anywhere.
Q,

12

I think it is probably higher than any

If one convicted by military Court-Martial really has

13

this substantial constitutional claim, he could just beg that

14

he be sentenced to prison so he can go into habeas corpus,

15

could he not?
A

IS

I think that is an important distinction that we have

habeas preserve where really —

17

Q,

13

Well, you have it preserved only when he is sent to

19

prison.

20

Portas, no matter how defective the Court-Martial proceedings,

21

if the Court of Military Appeals does not review it, he can

22

never get any court to review it.
A

23

Otherwise, if I understand your answer to Justice

Being deprived of one’s liberty or one's

24

life to which habeas also attaches is a far more injurious

25

thing than —

Q,

Than dismissal from the service as Augenblick was?

2

A

1 absolutely do not equate the two.

Secondlys the

3

Constitution prohibits any suspension of the writ of habeas

4

corpus except at time of war where as it is silent as to

5

suspension of the right of inaction for back pay one way or

6

the other.

I do not think you can really equate the two.
And I think you must also realize that at some point a;

7
0

conviction of Court-Martial must be final.

And I think it

9

reasonable to say that when Congress again, I think, is

to

jealously considering the rights of defendants in setting up an

It

elaborate system of review has considered the question and has

12

enacted the finality clause —

!3
14

Q

Why has Article IS never been passed?

Would it have

been your position that the Court of Claims had no jurisdiction?

15

A

I think at all times there has been a form of ™

16

Q

They purported to exercise it for eighty years without

17
18

any question.
A

There are various questions, Justice Harlan.

There

13

were a couple at the turn of the century, and there was one

20

involving a World War 11 conviction where the man was denied

21

right to counsel.

22
23
24
25

Q,

That was not taken to this Court.

The really Important thing, I suppose, is what is the

effect, what is the purpose of Article ?6?
A

I also think, however, that the possibility of

jurisdictional defects in military court3 is far less than we

11

1
2

may be talking about here today.
I can conceive of a civilian being improperly tried.

3

Of course, that may happen, but I think that court has laid

4

those questions to rest in many of its decisions.

5

I think it is virtually impossible, if not utterly

6

impossible to have an improperly constituted court, because

7

it is all laid out very clearly for the use of commanding

8

officers who were generally advised by Judge Advocates, and.

3

certainly a legal review of a patent defect of that character

10

would ultimately reach a trained la*?yer who would be able to

It

advise his superior that such a Court-Martial cannot stand.

12

I think if you look at what the Court of Claims did

13

here, you can see at least the evils in giving them a very

14

broad scope of review.

13

I would like to turn to the facts of these cases

16

briefly to show that these are cases in which this Court has

17

injected itself into the appellate proceedings unnecessarily,

18

and I think even under the broadest review, improperly.

19

In Augenblick, for example, as I said, we have a

20

purported Jencks Act question.

21

committing an unnatural sex act with one Airman Hodges and

22

Airman Hodges was interrogated by Maval Intelligence Officers

23

and purportedly a tape recording of his conversation was made.

24
25

Augenblick was accused of

When it came for trial this tape recording had
disappeared.

Contrary to what I think respondent Augenblick*s
12

1

brief says, a very full and adequate hearing was afforded

2

at the Court-Martial to try to find out what had happened to

3 ; that tape.
4

The government voluntarily produced eight witnesses,

5

each of whom testified before the Court-Martial as to what

6

precisely he knew about the tape, leading to the conclusion

7

that if one had been made, and it probably was that:

8

9

1.

The tape recording device might have failed

because at another time a partially garbled transcript was

10

obtained, but at worst the tape had reached an officer of Naval

11

Intelligence Investigator who, by accident, allowed the tape to

12

be erased when it was used to record someone else.

13

The reason that this tape was sought, supposedly,

14

was to investigate whether an alleged promise had been made to

15

Airman Hodges that if he testified against Augenblick he would

16

receive an honorable discharge.

17

own defense counsel had conceded that this could not have

IS

happened because, after all, Hodges was in the Air Porce and he

19

was being interrogated by Naval Intelligence Civilian Inspectors

20

and even an airman would not expect that a navy man could

21

promise him an honorable discharge from his own service.

22

this had been conceded away.

23

But at his Court-Martial his

So,

Moreover, we had a case of harmless error, because

24

while Hodges had testified the indecent act took place, two

25

police officers had not seen the act, but had seen something

13

t

related to it which was, while not the act, "indecent and

2

lascivious conduct."
The court convicted him only of the indecent and

3

4

lascivious conducts not of actually committing the unnatural

5

act«

6

He did not even believe
Q.

You are assuming all of this comes under Article 76

7

and that this is an appellate review, are you not, of a record

3

of a trial provided by Article 76.

9

appellate review within the sense that phrase Is used in

Therefore, if it is not

10

Article 76, it is an original proceeding in the Court of Claims

11

and as an original proceeding in the Court of Claims, 1 suppose

12

there are different standards that follow, but certainly

13

Article 76 does not govern, is that right?
If you assumed that this was an original proceeding

14
15

and not appellate review in the Court of Claims, does Article 76

15

apply?

17

A

I think it purports to foreclose a study of the

IS

further review of the issues raised in the Court-Martial,

19

Article 76 does, so whether you deem the Court of Claims Act

20

original review —

21

22

Q

To me that is the issue here, and It is an issue that

turns upon the precise language of Article 76.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Weisl, you may

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN L. WEISL, JR. (resumed)

8

MR. WEISL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Answering

7

the question that Mr. Justice Fortas posed just before the

8

lunch recess which I understand to be whether Article 76 applies

9

to an original proceeding in the Court of Claims as opposed to

10
ii
12
13

a mere appellate review, I think it is my position that I
believe Article 76 was designed to accomplish the foreclosure
of further proceedings even in the Court of Claims by way of
original suit.
The second sentence of Article ?6, which I would like

14
15
i5
n
18

13

to read to the court, reads as follows: "orders publishing
the proceedings of Courts-Martial and all action taken pursuant
to those proceedings are binding upon all departments, courts,
agencies and officers of the United States subject only to
action upon petition for a new trial as provided In Article 73."
But I do believe that in —

Q,

What were you reading?

A.

I was reading the second sentence of Article ?6.

is on page 2 of our brief.
1 would like to correct a misstatement that I made
and for which I apologize

15

It

ia

Q.

What does that mean; "orders publishing the

2

proceedings of Court-Martial and all action taken pursuant to

O'

those proceedings."

4

"action taken pursuant to the proceedings" was a discharge of

5

these men, but what does this first part mean, "orders

6

publishing the proceedings of Courts-Martial?"

7

A.

The second does not help me becauses

It seems to me it means the decisions and the language

8

of these decisions binds the courts and they must follow them.

9

I admit it is confusing and I do not believe the legislative

10

history enlightens us further on this particular point, except

11

that I would like to invite the Court’s attention to one

12

statement.

13

In both the House and the Senate purports on Article

14

76 itself, in which they say this of Article 76; "that subject

15

only to a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court,

15

Article 76 provides for the finality of Court-Martial pro­

17

ceedings and judgments."
So 1 think that the legislative history, at least,

18
19

supports the construction that I have placed upon this second

20

sentence.

21

Q

Mr. Weisl, I will ask a question.

Perhaps I should

22 I know but in some instances the defendant comes directly to this
23

Court from the Court of Military Appeals.

24

If that is so, is It?

25

A.

No, Mr. Chief Justice —
16

I am just wondering

1

Q

2

How did we get the Pulver ease?

Did that come from

habeas corpus?

3

&

Yes, sir

4

Q,

I beg your pardon, then I do not need to ask the

question.

5

A.

6

I think I made one misstatement that I would like to

7

correct, and then I believe I have left the Court in confusion

e

somewhat as to the scope of the Military Appeals powers of

9

review.
First, after the Juhl case, I stated to the Court

10
!1

that he had been discharged from the service.

A,

No, Commander Augenblick is the sexual offense.

He

IS

has been dismissed.

19

20
21

fined.

Juhl, who is the enlisted man who was found

This, of course, brings before us a question of the

I

j scope of military appeals po;<rers of review.
It has the power to review Courts-Martial when there

22
i

23

; is a sentence in excess of one year or when there is, as in the

24

case of an officer dismissal from the service, which is how

25

Augenblick got at least to the point where they decided not to

17

■?

hear it, and in the case of an enlisted man, if he gets a bad

2

conduct or dishonorable discharge, he then can have a review

3

by the Court of Military Appeals.

4

4

Furthermore, I analogize their review powers as to

5

Certiorari in this Court.

S

they are, in effect, doing a bit more than the mere denial of

7

a write of Certiorari, because if they fail to find good cause

S

they can decline to review it.

9

I believe, when they deny review

They at least have to look at a record and determine

to

whether there is good cause shown for review, which I believe

11

tends to be a stronger action than the mere denial of the writ

12

of Certiorari by this Court.

13
14
15
15

17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

I was at the close of my argument reviewing briefly
the facts in Augenblick to show you what the Court of Claims is
really doing hers.
I stated that they had heard eight witnesses to
determine what had happened to these tape recordings, and at
most, what was found was that the tape had been inadvertently
re-used, that the witness Hodges5 testimony was not that upon
which Augenblick was convicted.
It was, rather, that of police officers so, even if
the defense did not have this statement of Hodges, and even if
the statement that he made was wholly inconsistent with his

Further, a board of review heard the Augenblick case

2

a rather lengthly opinion, a dissenting opinion on the Jencks

o

Act question.

W'

4

Yet the Court of Claims elevated this whole question

5

into one of constitutionality.

6

their taking the case at all.

7

This is how they justified

I think this is one of the evils of giving the Court

8

of Claims a broad scope of review of Court-Martial because they

9

just let it go Into these facts they are going to look at, do

10

something which in effect the defendant and the Court-Martial

11

already has done for him by Congressional mandate, to wit, a

-12

fair chance of having his conviction reversed for errors of

13

the type that are present in Augenbliok.

14

Juhl is an even more striking example of why the

18

Court of Claims should be kept out of this area. I believe.

15

Juhl the question was whether his accomplice was the sole reason

17
13

In

he was convicted and if so, whether that accomplice's testimony
was self-contradictory.

19

And this question, the court acclaimed in its own

20

opinion, elevated to one of jurisdiction the Court-Martial.

21

If you have accomplished testimony, and use It improperly, this

22

deprives the Court-Martial of jurisdiction.

23
24
25

This is the way

the Court of Claims justified its action in Juhl.
Here is what happened.

Hughes was the accomplice of

Mr. Juhl and he testified that together; "Mr. Juhl and I have

19

1

j engaged in black market activites by buying goods from a PXS

2

as we were privileged in doing in England and selling them to

3

civilians at considerable profit to ourselves.”

4

Other witnesses, which I would think any civilian

5

court would conclude corroborative, testified that at one point

6

Mr. Juhl had gone into the PX and had bought a lot of extra

7

cigarettes and cigars.
Another witness placed Mr. Juhl at the scene where an

8

admitted sale by Hughes of black market cigars to civilians in

9
10

which civilians had taken place.

11

participating, but he was at least there, which certainly, I

12

suggest is corroboration.

He did not show Juhl actually

The wife of Hughes, the accomplice, saw defendant

13
14

Juhl at one point coming out of a building with a large roll of

15

English currency after a Mack market had apparently taken place.
The Court of Claims not only looked at the accomplice

16
17

testimony and said it was self-contradictory and uncorroborative,

IS

but they said it was jurisdictional.

19

Why was it jurisdictional?

Because someone had seen

20

fit to have a separate chapter in the rules relating to

21

accomplice testimony.
From this they concluded that they thought it was so

22
23

important, the accomplice testimony, that if you do not
i

24

properly charge it, you cannot face a conviction on it, and it

25

is jurisdictional, a bootstrap argument if 1 ever heard one.
20

1

I might adds also* that in Juhl we had an actual

2

waiver on an instruction on accomplice testimony, which was

o

offered to the defense, because the defense counsel, when the

4

law officer on the general Court-Martial said - do you want an

5

instruction on accomplice testimony replied, "No, I do not.

6

It is not important to our defense. It is not the theory of

7

our defense."
That is why I submit to this Court that our position,

8
9

which may seem a harsh one, even for lack of jurisdiction in

10

the Court-Martial the Court of Claims is foreclosed from review,

11

is not as harsh as it may sound.
Because of the provisions for a separate review of

12

3

these Court-Martials, when anything really damaging to a.

14

defendant takes place, a lengthy imprisonment, dismissal,

5
16

7

dishonorable discharge, bad conduct discharge, he is protected,
I submit.

Congress has seen to it that he is protected.
Secondly, if the Court of Claims is going to assume

8

jurisdiction of these cases that elevate the very close, I do

9

not even think

it is close, Jencks Act question in Augenblick

20

to a constitutional question of the first magnitude, or take

21

accomplice testimony of a simple question where I think the

22

Court of Claims was clearly wrong, it was even waived by the

23

defendant, and say this is a jurisdiction defect in the

24

Court-Martial, you are going to have every single Court-Martial

25

that results in affirmance by any point in the line brought to
21

1

the Court of Claims in one final effort for one final reversal.
This is something that is contrary to good sense, I

think.

A.

No, Mr. Chief Justice.
Now I say that if this Court were to find that there

is a limited scope of review on the part of the Court of Claims,
it should find at most that there is a right to review in
respect to whether the Court-Martial had a jurisdiction of the
person or the subject matter.
Answering an earlier question of Justice Harlan, as
to whether Article 76 did not exist, would we be taking this
position here in the Court, the answer is no.
The Court of Claims had purported to exercise the
power to review Courts-Martial for lack of jurisdiction in the
past, and 1 would concede it is absent from Article ?6 today.

22

Once again, in order to bootstrap itself into giving

Q

Mr, Weisl, can this plaintiff go anywhere else, beside s

the Court of Claims to sue for back pay?
A.

To sue for back pay, no, sir.

He could, however, go

22

to these boards of the correction of records to try to have his

23

conviction expunged, which would give him —

Back pay, and that is within the jurisdiction of the

That is correct.

That is not the case of Shapiro?

8

Q

You do not, then, just say that there is anything

9

SO
ii

distinctive about the Court of Claims as compared with a
District Court?
A

No3 sire, except that I would say in the sense that it :

12

reviews convictions and to my mind lacks the expertise of a

13

District Court in looking into these matters.

14

decisions in both these cases illustrates that lack of

15

expertise very well.

Q

I think the

As I say in™

Do you place your finality argument on the fact that

this is the Court of Claims —
A,

No, I would say this is final as to any court except

in habeas corpus situations.
Q

And you say, at least it is your primary argument,

21

that even jurisdictional questions are not reviewable in a pay

22

claim in a Court of Claims?

23

A

We have taken that position, Mr. Justice Steivart.

24

I would say this, that one of the reasons that leads me to

25

make this argument here is that it is not as harsh as it seems,
2k

i

and I think I have pointed out why it is not.

o
Or

To the extent that this Court feels that my position
is harsh and is unfair to people, I would certainly not walk

4

out of this courtroom feeling that the government has been done

5

a disservice, if the Court were to hold otherwise.

6

I do feel that it is not necessary to the Court of

7

Claims to give this kind of power In order to protect

8

defendants of military Court-Martial.

9

ft

Sven if given its old traditional power that it used,

10

to exercise around the turn of the century and perhaps later,

ti

prior to the recent wholesale amendments of the military justice-

12

system., these two cases certainly do not come close to

13

approaching that power, is that right?

!4

A.

Let me add one warning note to the assumption by the

15

Court of Claims of the power to decide questions of jurisdiction

16.

Remember that in each of these cases it did try to elevate these

17

questions into jurisdictional ones or constitutional ones.
The only review of the Court of Claims is in this

18
19

Court.

20

i-fhere they were clearly wrong, will have to come into the

21

Supreme Court on rather simple, elementary criminal lax? question s

22

that the Court of Claims has demonstrated it lacks expertise on

23

and the decision in this case clearly shows it.

24
25

Q,

Does that mean that the government cases, such as these,

I just want to follow that up with one more question;

that is the Shapiro case, which did go considerably further

25

I

! than this earlier jurisdictional ease in the Court of Claims

■.

| and which was on the books at the time when Congress enacted
r-\

| the new legislation with i’espect to military justice and
therefore Congress can be presumed to have known about that
case.

What do you do with that?
A.

I think that the language of Article 76 together with

i

the statement from the House and Senate reports that I read to

8

the Court about finality, indicates that they did not consider
Shapiro or Intended to overrule it.

10

say that Article 76 as a whole was a codification.
I do not agree that Shapiro was written into the lav;.

11

12

They did, at one point,

It may have been, but I just do not feel that that was the case.

13

Q

What were the facts in that case?

14

A.

The Shapiro case was amusing enough to recite at

15

length, I think.

IS

The way he had done it was by substituting one Mexican-American

17

for another and the rape victim

18

the imposter as the actual defendant.

19

Shapiro defended a man at a Court-Martial.

and €?veryone else identified

The defendant in that case was acquitted and so

20

enraged Shapiro's superiors that they had him tried for ob­

21

structing justice, and they gave him a half-hour to prepare.

22
23
24
25

He asked for counsel, counsel asked for time to
prepare and they denied it.

They held, in effect, he had been

| denied his right to counsel.

Under Johnson and Zerbts, in

effect, not having counsel at the trial deprived the court of
26

jurisdiction, and therefore they gave him his pay.
Obviously, the government did not choose to take
Shapiro to this Court, so I do not think that failure to appeal
that case can be used as inference that we acquiesed in that I

Q,

Then your position here is that the Court of Claims

has no function with respect to the assertion of claims for
back pay where the person has been separated from military
service by Court-Martial.

You would just carve that out of the

clear state’s jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, would you not ?
A.

Yes, sir.

Q,

Were there any similar situations that would arise

outside of the Courts-Martial ?

For example with respect to

civil servants, is there procedure for a dismissal from a
statutory provision that the dismissal shall be final and
conclusive?
A.

I know of none, Mr. Justice Fortas.

On the other hand,

where the dismissals have been reviewed in the appellate courts.
I do not know any ease where they have then gone to the Court of
Claims and sought back pay.

But again I am not able to

adequately answer your question.
Q

There are claims for back pay by civilian employees

who claim that they have been unjustly dismissed.
A,

I know of no statute that would prevent them from

going to the Court of Claims, despite the fact that their
dismissal had been reviewed by the Courts of Appeal, or even

i

27

1

this Court.

2

Q

The Court of Claims still has jurisdiction over

+J

Commander Augenbliek’s claim.

They just deny it, and they

4

sue and there is the defense that he has been in the service,

5

and they grant some re-judgment.

6

A

That is correct.

7

Q

They would have jurisdiction, but they cannot, under

e

your theory, they cannot pass on constitutional, jurisdictional,

9

evidentiary issues, so I do not think you will have a very hard

'10

ii

time.
A,

Yes, but as stated by you, Mr. Justice Portas, I think

12

the consequences to these defendats are much harsher than they

13

really are.

That is our position.

14
15

I agree with you, though.
I would like to reserve the

balance of my time which I trust I will not have to use.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Let us get right to the heart of the matter.
There is an issue of law before this Court, an issue

of law as posed by the government’s position in this case.

24

The government is proposing that all servicemen who

25

have been subjected to unconstitutional abuse in their Court28

.

1

Martial and have been dismissed and disgraced cannot go to any

2

civilian court, cannot come to this Court for protection of their

3

constitutional rights.
The government would have this Court believe that

4
5

the Congress did this 5 this sweeping reform, not by any

S

statutory language or by any manifestation intent, but did this

7

by silence.
Mr. Weisl has said this is not a harsh result.

S
9

The case I am talking abouta which is completely within the

10

govex’nraent’s position as was articulated here today, is that

11

if the defendant is denied counsel, is tortured into a confession,

12

is ordered convicted by a kangaroo court and is given trial by

13

fire or ordeal by order of his commanding officer, then dis­

14

missed and disgraced rather than be put in jail, he can go

15

nowhere.

16

Q

He can go to the Court of Military Appeals.

17

A.

He can go to the Court of Military Appeals.That is

18

correct.

19

Court of Military Appeals here in this case.
The Court of Military Appeals denied this case without

And we have a perfect example of what happened in the

any reason for it, without any statement, denied the review.

If they had taken it and affirmed It, you could not

There is no jurisdiction between the Court of

No, I am talking about the procedure that they have

as between the Court-Martial and themselves.

7

where it is optional with them.

8

A

In these cases

Contrary to what Mr. Weisl said., as far as I read

9

the Uniform Code of Military Justice, their jurisdiction over

10

matters such as this is discretionary above the limit that Mr.

n

Weisl posed; that is to say, if there is a fine of a certain

12

amount or dismissal, then they have discretionary jurisdiction.

13

They do not have to take the case.

14

A

They

They had discretion here and they deigned not to

17

exercise their discretion.

The real key to this, Mr. Chief

18

Justice is not whether you can go to the Court of Military

19

Appeals, but whether constitutional rights of servicemen or the

20

final arbitor of these constitutional rights is this Court.

21

4

What

22

A

In this case?

23

Q

Yes.

24

A

Mr. Justice Marshall, we are talking about the

25

constitutional right are you asserting?

constitutional right to prepare an adequate defense against
30

1
«

impropriety that is spread throughout this record*

2

This record on the face of it involves four --

u

Q.

4

A,

Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment* sir.

5

Q.

What is the denial of due process here?

S

A,

<Ql

What constitutional section are you relying on?

The denial of due process here Is the deprivation of

7

the right of the defense through statutory rights that he has

8

been granted to prepare a defense against impropriety that Is

9

rife on this record.

10

And if I can recite the facts

after

all* due process is a visceral reaction to facts.

11

And the facts of this case are as folloxfs:

12

In this case you had first a sex offense* which is

13

a private offense in xrtiich the word of the participants are

14

the only things that can give the lie to the accusation.
2.

15

You had the chief accuser* the accuser whose

16

evidence was the controlling evidence in the conviction here*

17

Interviewed immediately after the arrest by agents of the

18

office of Naval Intelligence.
Prior to this interview* this chief and controlling

19
20

witness* this partner in this alleged crime* had denied any

21

participation by him and by the defendant.

22

he changed his story and claimed that there was a sex act* and

23

that he participated —

24
25

Q,

After the interview

The client had a right to go to the Court of Appeals

as one conferred by the Congress, is that right?
31

Court of Military Appeals?

Q,

Court of Claims .

O

A.

That is corrects sir.

4

Q,

Possibly Congress can circumscribe that right in

5

various ways, and I suspect the first test was made to ascertair

6

if Congress intended to circumscribe a jurisdiction on the

7

Court of Claims in a way that Mr, Weisl is arguing.
Thens if you conclude that Congress did intend to

S
9

10

!?

circumscribe the jurisdiction of the Court of Claimss maybe you
turn next to what it meant as a constitutional point.
A,

I think that is corrects sir.

If I may deal with

12

them in just that order and get back to Mr. Justice Marshall’s

13

questions because I think it is important to deal with the

14

facts as they really were in this case.

15

Q,

On the use of that witness that you just mentioned,

16

do the facts that you have related go to the credibility of

17

the witness rather than to the right to testify?

18

A.

Mos sir.

He does not go to credibility.

What is does

19

is go to the question of Impropriety on the part of the

20

prosecution in arranging for the testimony of this key witness.

21

22
23
24
25

The one fact that I did not add which is quite
compelling in this case, is that after this change of story
which took place during this interview, this airman was
promised an honorable discharge and is so stated in the record.
But he was not given this discharge.

32

This discharge x^as kept

hanging over his head through nine months and through two
2i

trials, and only after he testified against the commander

3

with the testimony that he had changed during this Interview

4

was he then granted this honorable discharge.

5

He was not punished at all; although under the laws

S

of the military he was placed in peril delicto with the

7

defendant here.

8

Q

Would not that sill go to credibility?

9

A.

No, Mr, Chief Justice, I think it goes to a point

10

beyond credibility.

1!

It goes to the question of the ability of the defendant to

12

raise a defense against the chief witness against him.

It goes to the question of impropriety.

The violations here, against which all the facts

13
14

which I have just recited must be ranged, as a backdrop, the

15

violations here were violations of the Jencks Act.

16

taken of this key interview, two hours afterward, during which

17

time this witness changes his story - this sole witness - in

18

Q,

It is not then a constitutional question?

It

A.

It is In this case, for the following reasons.

12

Q,

The facts are not constitutional.

13

A.

No, sir, facts can very often and most often not be.

14

In this case the resolution by the navy was to put the burden

15

of proof of bad faith on the governments in losing this tape,

16

or in destroying it, on the defendant.
This obligation for production is the governments

17
18

obligation -~

19

Q,

What constitutional section does that deal with?

20

A.

By itself, sir, it does not deal with any constitutional

21

section at all.

That is a violation of the Jencks Act —

22

Q

It is all a question of fact, is it not?

23

A,

No, sir, these are questions of law, every one of

24

them.

They are questions of law In the administration of the

25

Jencks Act under the clrsumstances of this case.
34

I

Judge Davis j, speaking for the court below, said,

2

"It Is obvious that in all cases Jencks Act violations are not

3

violations of the constitution.” And we adhere to that position.

4

In the circumstances of this case, with the navy

5

dealing with the absence of these key Jencks materials by

6

placing the burden on the defendant to prove bad faith of the

7

government, a defendant who is powerless to prove any bad faith

8

on the part of the government, when the government has the
.

9

10

n

obligation to produce.

That rule of law, sir, is the rule of

law that is revlewabla in constitutional terms —
Q

I have not gotten to that, so I do not know, as of

12

right now, whether those tapes were in existence at the time

13

you are talking about.

1 just do not know.

14

A.

That is quite true, sir —

15

Q,

And you do not know.

1G

A.

That is quit® true, sir.

17

Q,

Maybe nobody knows,

18

A.

That is quite true, but the navy' s exoneration of

19

the government's obligation to produce these tapes, which were

20

obviously in the navy's hands —

21

Q

At that time?

In the navy's hands at that time?

22

A.

The navy, the individual who took the tapes was the

23

last one who the record shows had the tapes, and he was the one

24

in whose hands the tape disappeared.

25

Q,

You say there was evidence that the tapes could very
35

5
H

well have been destroyed when they could not find them?
A.

There is certainly evidence to that effect, sir.

3

But there Is also evidence that this was in violation of the

4

navy’s own policies and regulations in regard to Jencks

5

material.

6

There is further testimony that the last person who

7

had this tape was the same person that was in this interview,

G

that denied for at least twelve pages of testimony that this

9

tape ever had been taken.

10

Then it is given into his hands by a superior officer,

11

and in his hands it disappears.

12

conduct by saying if the burden of proof is on the defendant

13

it shows the navy’s bad faith.

14

The navy justifies this

That, sir, is a rule of law.

That, sir, raises on

IS

the factual pattern of this case a constitutional question;

not as to the Jencks Act, but as the right of the defendant

17

to raise a defense as impropriety on the facts of this case

and no further.

If I may go back to the facts that were raised by
Mr. Justice Portas.

of the articles of war.

36

This, as we set forth

1
2
O
w'

4

Contrary to any attempt at trying to eliminate rights
of servicemen.,» the Vanderbilt Report which gave rise to the
Kem-Elston Amendments in 19*18, had as a point the enlargement
and protection of servicemen.

5

The Vanderbilt Report indicated that the point of the

6

Van Article 50(h) which became word for word Article 76 is to

7

indicate at what point inside the military establishment these

0

judgments become final.

9

That is to say that they are impervious to command

10

control; they cannot be set aside by commanding officers

It

deciding they do not like the result of this Court-Martial and

12

trying them by another court.
That was the point of Article 76, and it was a point

13
14

articulated by Judge Vanderbilt in the Vanderbilt Report.

15

There was not a word said about the Court of Claims

!6

not a word said about civilian review, in all of the delibera­

17

tions that gave rise to the Kem-Elston Amendments.

There was

18

Q,

Was that true the second time?

19

A

That —

20

Q,

Binding upon all the parts of the court decisions?

21

A

Yes, sir I think that is because —

22

Q

23
24

25

I mean, does it have that limitation?

It certainly

does not, on the fact of it, does it?
A

The point of that, Insofar as I can see is that —

there are very many muddy things about the legislative history

37

1

in this, but the point of that, as I can see it, is the

2

elimination of command control, in the first place, to indicate

•3

where the cutting off point of military procedures are as it
was —
Q

5

Not necessarily.

On the face, the language is all

6

fact, taken pursuant to those proceedings and binding upon all

7

the parties, courts What did the courts have to do with the change of

8

command control?

9

A.

10

I believe that had to do with that, in a situation

n

such as this where you had a Court-Martial determination, that

n

the federal civilian courts which is all that could be ruled

13

upon here, could not, under those circumstances try the

14

serviceman for the same crime„

15

which is wholly apart from anything we are talking about here.

I think it had that effect,

There is some legislative history to that effect,

16

17

Mr. Justice Brennan, but that has nothing to do with collateral

18

review of these matters for constitutional errors.
Now, to point out, when I say that everything that

19

20

the government says today here is based on silence, I mean

21

silence, because I think that Article 58 aimed at the elimina­

22

tion of command control, aimed at picking a point of time at

23

which military remedies were exhausted, so that you could then

24

go to the civilian remedies, and in 1948 when the Kem-Elston
Amendments came into being, which became Article ?6 two years

25

38
li

1

later, there is not a single word about the elimination of the

2

traditional Court of Claims remedy for back pay — not one

3

word anywhere in the legislative history.

4

5
6

Q

Would you agree that the Court of Claims could not

properly re-evaluate the evidence?
A

I think that is clear that the Court of Claims could

7

not properly do that as it is not an ordinary appellate review

8

of Court-Martials —

9
10

0,

Claims could not arrive at a different objection.
A

11

Unless it is a constitutional claim, the Court of

I would heartily agree with that, Mr. Justice.

12

Unless you have rules of lav/ that come to this Court as rules

13

of law and do not involve any re-shifting of the evidence,

14

which this Court very specifically proscribed in Burns versus

15

Wilson, then you do not have any jurisdiction in the Court of

16

Claims.

17

You do have jurisdiction in the Court of Claims where

18

you have rules of law such as you have in this case; the putting

19

of the burden for showing bad faith in the destruction of Jencks

20

materials, or the negligent loss of bad materials on the

21

defendant, such as the failure to conduct an in camera examina­

22

tion of the notes taken during this key interview; such as the

23

failure to call the key witness as to what happened.

.

24
25

The witness who denied ever taking this tape and the
witness in whose hands this tape disappeared; the failure to

39

1

Q

/fj

3
4
S

call him; these are rules of lav;.

They have nothing to do with

factsj they do not require any sifting of the evidence by the
Court of Claimss or by any court.
Q

Is not every mistake as a rule of law permitted in

the trial of a case that amounts to constitutional law?

6

A.

Absolutely not.

7

Q

What you are saying here is that so many mistakes werej

Our position is —

3

made that In the aggregate they amount to constitutional error.

9

Is that your point?
•

10

A

;

What we are saying here in this case is that, exactly

11

that; that the Jencks deprivation, the right that this Court has!

12

enunciated in all of the cases of Johnson vesr-sus Zerbst, through)

13

Alcorta, through Pyle„ through the most recent one,the Giles

14

case, and all the cases right down the line, that a defendant

IS

is entitled to a trial free from impropriety, is meaningless to

16

him unless the rights guaranteed him by statute exist to him to

17

inquire into that impropriety.

18

J

The right to inquire into that impropiety where the

19

impropriety is on the record, as it is in this case, is co­

20

extensive in dignity, with his right to a trial free from that

21

impropriety.

22

I would like to point out to the Court that on the

23

very next day, June 25, 1948, that the Kem-Elston Act passed

24

Article 50(h), which is haec verba with Article 76, exactly the

25

same, the Tucker Act was re-enacted by the Congress.

& ho

1

In facts that is the best jurisdiction of the Court

2

of Claims to do just what it did in the Augenblick case, and

3

was re-enacted with considerable legislative history, and

4

there is not one word about a major excision of one of the

5

functions of the Court of Claims in that history, although

6

five years later, when the Tucker Act was again re-enacted,

7

and a portion of its jurisdiction excised, it was done in

e

unmistakable terms.
In 1953 the Court of Claims Act —

9
10

Q,

I gather, listening to your argument, that you do

11

not take the position that Congress could not have barred

12

the Court of Claims from making this inquiry, do you?

13

A.

The Congress —

U'

Q

Could not Congress constitutionally have barred the

15
16

Court of Claims from making this inquiry?
A,

Mr. Justice Brennan, that raises one of the grave,

17

grave questions of constitutional law, which I think is

18

presently unresolved.

19

Congress could have told servicemen who have —-

20

Q

I think there is grave doubt that

That was not my question.

My question was whether

21

Congress could have said that the Court of Claims could not

22

have jurisdiction, if you please, or whatever language you want

23

to use - bar the Court of Claims from making the inquiry into

24

this Court-Martial that it did make.

25

A.

I think that there Is some large question of

*♦ if i

1

constitutionality as to whether Congress can do that.

2

so in my brief.

3
4

5

Q,

Not if they abolish it - Congress could abolish the

Court of Claims, could it not?
A

I said

It created it.

Yess they could do that.

The question is whether

6

Congress could take servicemen who have acknowledged

7

Constitutional rights, and this Court has articulated them in

8

Burns versus Wilson --

9

Q

We are talking about a particular tribunal

10

A.

Yes, sir, and my answer has to involve a question of

11

constitutional rights of servicemen.

12

certainly do that, sir.
But Congress, I do not think, can take a group of

13
14

15

The Congress could

American citizens —
Q

Let me ask you this: then you are saying that if we

IS

were to construe 76 as barring the Court of Claims from making

17

this inquiry, then your position is that Article 76 is un­

18

constitutional?

19

A

We say this in our brief and we stand by it; the

20

reason being that here you have constitutional rights of

21

servicemen, so articulated by this Court in Burns v. Wilson

22

with no Article 3 court to go to protect those rights.

23

Q,

Burns did not involve salary.

24

A

No, sir.

25

Burns x^ras habeas corpus, but Burns articulat

constitutional rights, Mr. Justice Marshall, and my point is

1

that if there are constitutional rights, then they are

2

meaningless unless there is a court to protect them.
;

3
4

And an Article 1 court, such as the Court of Military
Appeals has none of these attributes of an Article 3 court,

5

I think that the sum and substance is that the

6

Supreme Court is and should remain the final arbiter of the

1

constitutional rights of servicemen.

8

0,

You want us to declare Article 76 unconstitutional?

9

A

No, sir, I do not,

I want this Court simply to view j

10

the legislative history which I believe it is properly viewing,

11

and that is not in any way —•

12

Q

Let us see how far this goes, Mr. Sharlitt.

Suppose

13

this had been taken to the Court of Military Appeals and had

14

been a constitutional question and resolved against your position

15

by the Court of Military Appeals.

16

have had jurisdiction to review the judgment of the Court of

17

Military Appeals?

Are you saying we then would!

18

A

No, sir.

I am saying --

19

Q

Then I do not follow your argument, that this Court

20

should be the tribunal of last resort on the constitutional

21

rights of servicemen.

22
23
24
25

A

Yes.

The only way Commander Augenblick can get to

this Court is through the Court of Claims.
Q,

No, that was not my question t© you.

Suppose his

application to the Court of Military Appeals had been granted,

1

They had considered his claim on the merits, and had affirmed

2

the dismissals finding no merit in his constitutional claims,

3

the ones you are now asserting and did assert in the Court of

4

Claims,

5

Claims?

Could this Court ever review the Court of Military

6

A.

No^ sir; not by direct review at all.

7

Q,

There are exceptions to the general proposition that

8
9

this Court should remain the Court of last resort for the - -

k

No, sir, there are none.

Because I am saying that in

10

order to accept the governments position you have to state that

11

the commander did go to - the Court of Claims is denied him.
The reason he would have no review would be that he

12
13

was cut off from the Court of Claims review.

14

avenue - to come here.

15

Q,

That is his only

He had an opportunity for review and it was denied

IS

him in the Court of Military Appeals, was it not?

17

very same claims?

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

A.

On these

My point was that our final arbiter of the con­

stitutionality of servicemen should be the Supreme Court —
Q

Why is that?

Where do you find that in the

constitution?

k

I do not, sir.

Q

Or anywhere else?

k

But I do believe —

Q,

What if the Congress said that in no event shall the

htf.

!

1
2

Supreme Court review any instances of Court-Martial judgments?
A.

If they had said that, the question would have been

posed squarely, and it has not said that, and until it does, I
4
5
6
7

think —*
Q,

You cannot find any grant by the Congress of any

jurisdiction to this Court to review Court-Martial.
A.

No, sir, but I can give you a long line of cases

8

where this Court has strained in every circumstance to find

9

judicial review in a situation where Congress has purported to

10

grant finality to an administrative agency, starting with

it

MeCardie back after the Civil War and going right through to

\z

Yakus, through all these cases where this Court, looking at

13

ambiguous Congressional enactments, has always attempted to

14

find some review.
It is turned the other way around in this case.

IS
16
17

Q

Mr. Sharlitt, suppose the serviceman was found guilty

of some minor charge and given six months without salary.

And

18

he is still in the army.

Is it your position that he could

19

still go to the Court of Appeals and say 1 did not get my Jencks

20

Act material, so I want my salary.

21

A.

He then could not

22

Q,

He is out - he has served his six months in the

23
24

25

stockade.

But he is still in the army.

A

Under those circumstances —■

Q

He could go to the Court of Claims and litigate his

!
2

back pay for that six months •—
A.

No.

If he had. been denied back pay, I believe it

w

falls within the jurisdiction limits; I would say that he would

4

be entitled to back pay—

e?
6

Q,

No, my point is that he just alleges that he was

denied Jencks Act material.

7

A-.

Nos sir, because —

8

Q,

What else would he have to do?

9

A.

He would have to show exactly what Judge Davis and

to

the unanimous court found below.

11

of unconstitutionality in —

iz
13

All right, he sends a record which shows that, and he j

Q,

is still over in Germany, but the Court of Claims will give
.

14
15

The record supported a finding

'

him his back pay.
A.

I believe, under those circumstances, that the Court

16

of Claims jurisdiction for back pay still exists, and in that

17

case —

18

Q

What happens to the army discipline in the meantime?

19

A.

Army discipline, sir is —

20

Q

What happens to army discipline in that regiment in

2!

the meantime, when the Court of Claims moves in and upsets the

22

army discipline.

23
24
25

A.

Army discipline is always involved in these matters,

when army prosecutions are conducted irregularly.
Q.

I do not think army discipline, as of now, is

j

1

involved with your commander* because he is out.

2

about this man who is still in.

3
4

A,

I am talking

1 do not think constitutionality of a Court-Martial

turns on whether a man is in or out, sir.

5

Q,

Discipline does.

6

A

Discipline and unconstitutionality are two different

7

thingss and this Court has said so.
.

8
9

Q,

So that under your theory, no judgment of a Court-

Martial would be final until passed on by the Court of Claims.

10

A

Absolutely not* sir.

11

(J

Close.

12

A.

No, sir, not even close - miles apart.

Because I

13

might point out that twice in seventeen years the Court of

14

Claims has exercised its jurisdiction and in the Augenblick

15

case —

16
17
18
19
20

Q,

That was before this case, and I am looking to the

future.
A

I might point out that there has been no flood in

the Court of Claims and there will not be, sir.
Q,

Could it not be that they read Article 76 to say

21

that no court has the jurisdiction.

22

people v;ho did not go to the Court of Claims read that

23

literally - that the Court did not have jurisdiction, so why

24

waste their time?

25

A

Could it be that these

I think there were at least seven or eight times,

^7

\

s

Mr. Justice Marshall,, where these cases were taken to the

2

Court of Claimss where the Court of Claims went through the

O

exercise that the government now says was forbidden to them,

4

looking at the merits assumed jurisdiction9 looked at the

5

merits and denied the relief on the grounds that there was no

6

constitutional exercise.

7

So If there were any clubhouse or barracks lawyers,

3

and they have always existed, it has not been the language of

9

Article 76 that has inhibited this review, It has been the

to

restraint of the Court of Claims.
The Court of Claims was waiting until it was faced

11
52

with a proper record.

13

a proper record.

14

Claims, then, among the various consequences the Jencks Act

15

can be forgotten in the military, because the rule of law that

10

will apply In the military Is that any time a prosecution has

17

a Jenclcs material that he does not want to turn over to the

18

defendant, then he just does not turn it- over and hopes that

19

the defendant cannot prove that he did not destroy It.

20

It did not act until it was faced with

If this man is denied review by the Court of
<

Q,

That Is not the ease lav/ of the Court of Military

21

Appeals, is It?

22

the development in case law for Courts-Martial In this area?

Isn’t that the tribunal trusted basically with

23

A.

That is correct, sir.

24

Q,

They can be counted on to do so, based on their past

25

'

record, can they not?

*1

I

A.

As Mr. Weis! pointed out9 there is additional

2

quantum of rejection that is involved in the GMA turning down

3

a case much more than this Court turning down a case.

4

And I would point out that in the Board of Review’s

5

opinion which deals with this case, that the law now is the

©

law for the military since this went to the Court of Military

7

Appeals, and there was no review of this determination on

8

Jencks, is that the clear burden, and it could not be clearer,

9

it is in the record here, the clear burden falls on the

10

defendant to prove bad faith.

n

That has never been ruled on.

That point has never

iz

before been ruled on by the CMA, so apparently that is the law

13

of the military unless this Court does something about it.
This Court is not sitting in a supervisory role over

14
IS

the CMA.

16

is that one of the necessary consequences with this Court’s

17

dealing with what is a clear constitutional question in terms of

18

this man’s right to defend himself, would be that a therapeutic

19

effect on the military of this complete misconception of Jeneks

20

rights.

21

I am not pointing that out.

What I am pointing out

And it xvent not only to one point but to four points.
It went to the burden of proof being put on the wrong

22

party, when the Jencks material is not produced, failure to

23

conduct an in camera examination of admitted notes, admitted

24

Jencks material, failure to incorporate those notes into the

25

records so that anybody, the Court of Military Appeals or

1

anybody else eould view its and the failure to call a key

2

witness to determine what happened to these tapes, the witness

3

who denied it was taken, and the witness into whose hands it

4

disappeared, under circumstances that are most incriminating.

«

w

Q

Mr. Sharlitt, suppose the Court of Military Appeals

6

had taken this case instead of having refused to review it,

7

had heard all of your arguments along this line, and had

3

affirmed the conviction of this man.

9

then be available to you?

10

A

Would the Court of Claims

Yes, sir, it would, because the reason that the sole

11

way to come again, the sole way to determine the constitutionality

12

of this action would be in this Court, and the only way the

13

commander could come to this Court would be through the Court

14

of Claims.

15

Under those circumstances, the rule, the scope of

16

civilian review as enunciated in Burns versus Wilson is whether

17

fair consideration has been given.

18

Now some consideration is not fair consideration, and

19

when rules of lav/ are completely misstated, 1 do not believe

20

that any court would determine that this is fair consideration.

21

I would say that on the facts of this case, the

22

constitutional issue had been raised, and these Jencks Act

23

violations and the legislative history indicate that the Court

24

of Claims, neither in 19^8 or in 1950 was excised of this

25

Jurisdiction.

49 SO

1

Nothing was said about them» In point of fact the

2

only thing that was said was to the effect that in a report

«rs,

W>

that was filed in the Congressional record that the Court of

4

Claims jurisdiction remained, and under those circumstances

5

this Court cannot deprive servicemen of the right to come to

6

this Court by silence and by implication.

7

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS J. STEINER, JR.
MR. STEINER:

the court.

Mr. Steiner.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The Court-Martial of Kenneth N. Juhl was

fundamentally unfair.
The testimony against him was by a man named Hughes,

13
14

who was an accomplice.

15

perjury.

Hughes® testimony was an admitted

He had engaged in black marketing for years.

16

He was

tried himself, sentenced, and convicted.

and told that unless you testify, implicate Juhl, we are going

:

5

Who is to be the judge of that?

I think, not that court, necessarily. Your Honor.

Do you have anything in your case other than

credibility of the witnesses?

Yes, Your Honor.

It Is not just the credibility of

It is a question of all of these facts snowing

Your Honor, if the facts were the same as this I

would say yes,

24

evidence it would not be sufficient to convict.

25

I would say with all of the self-contradictions

Based upon the facts of this case, with the contra55

j this record from back to front and not conclude that this

man was lying.

I do not believe It.

There can be no reasonable doubt about it.
Q

Is there any other- evidence besides him in this case?

A.

None that would tie him - there is other testimony —

Q,

Nothing that would corroborate him?

A.

Nothing that would corroborate him, Your Honor, I do

not believe.

This may be a judgment also.

Again, I believe,

reading the record, this is not controverted fact, but the only
conclusion you can reach - that it is not corroborated.
For example, they have the sales girls.

unusual amounts.
excessive amounts.

The sales girls said he did not purchase
He purchased what was normal, never in

excess of his rights.
Q

Did they not also testify that they punctured twice

in the same hole on his ration card?
A.

No, Your Honor.

I do not think she testified to that.

She did not say she did that to Juhl.
Q

How did that get in the record?

A.

Oh, yes, Your Honor, there are —

This is really the key

This is the reason the Air Porce convicted

20

him to defend it, but that is the very reason that this man has

21

do anything about it.

25

But the thing is, it x^as seized

It was Illegally seized.

It is something that should

never have been brought up, and if It should have been, it

2,2

Is that what

Yes, I am questioning that opinion.

In my brief I say this is another basis for jurisdiction.
In the first place, under the correction statute, the
secretary can attack a Court-Martial.

In other words, section 7>s

the finality clause says that this decision of the Court-Martial

64

)

I

shall be final on all officers.
Then they come along with the correction statute

2

3

where the secretary wants to correct them, to save Congress

4

from making private bills, so the Attorney General rules, and

5

the government agrees, the secretary can then collaterally

6

attack the Court-Martial.

The secretary can do that.

The decision of the secretary is Just final on

"7

/

8

officers, it is not final on courts.

All the decisions of the

9

secretary under the correction board can be reviewed by the

10

Court of Claims.

U

or any other thing to show that they could not review a Court-

12

Martial.

53

There is no basis in the legislative history

Nowhere does it say that.
The government admits that the secretary can

14

collaterally attack it.

15

and the statute on which he does it is only final on officers,

16

not final on courts.

17

18
19

That is an exception to section 76,

So under the correction statute he has a right to be
reviewed in the Court of Claims.

Nowhere does it say otherwise.

But even this section ?6 is final,I believe, under

20

the decisions of this Court in Estep versus United States and

21

the Harmon versus Brueker case. We had ether statutes that had

22

finality provisions in them, v/here there was a finality provisio i

1552(a), 22 USCA, 10 USCA, pardon me.

15

Q

What does that involved?

16

A

Your Honor, there the secretary is given the

17

authority to correct any record point in justice.

18

Q

Is that about a hearing, is it on the record, or how

19

is it done?

20

A

He gathers all the records, he will accept any evident

21

you have, affidavits, or he can also hold a hearing.

22

this is decided on the record.

Q

Many timei

What does he do, appoint a board for that purpose?

Is there a permanent board, an ad hoc board, or what?
A

I am not sure of the exact procedure.

They do have

I

someone over here who does this work, who reviews it, and says

2

this is what can be done.

3

The statute reads, "The secretary of a military

4

department under procedure established by him and approved by

5

the Secretary of Defense, and acting through boards of

6

civilians of the executive"

7

Q.

That indicates that there is a board, then —

8

A

Yes, Your Honor, "through the executive part of that

9

military department, may correct any military record of that

10

department when he considers it necessary to correct an error

11

or remove an injustice."
That is then reviewable in the Court of Claims.

12

They:

13

considered in this correction statute the question of making it

14

final on the courts, in the legislative history, and they did

15

not.
Q,

Are there some jurisdictional limits on what the

I have three, really.
The Augenbliek

case did not have any.
A.

I do not know about Augenbliek.

There is something

5

about that - I know they did not make it an issue in the Court

6

of Claims, whether they would appeal under the Board of

7

Corrections.

B

But there were other differences —

9

Q,

But I hate to say on Augenbliek on this thing.

You were saying,, if I understand you, that whatever

.

10

may be the interpretation of 76, there is review in the Court

It

of Claims of the determination of the board to correct the

12

records, because Congress considered having the same prohibition

13

against judicial review as to determinations of that board,

14

and they rejected that in this case.

15
15
17
18
19

A

Yes, Your Honor.

This legislative history is in

Ashe versus McNamara. They discuss it pretty thoroughly.
Q,

Is there any express statute which grants the Court

of Claims this kind of appellate jurisdiction?
A

Well, Your Honor, the Court of Claims has jurisdiction

20 { under any statute, treaty or constitution.
21

And this would be

under a statute.

22

Q,

You mean mainly a pay statute?

23

A

Yes, the pay statute, and also the correction board

24
25

statute.

Because the secretary, under the statute, is given

the authority to correct error or correct an injustice, and

6?

1

if that decision is arbitrary and capricious and not supported

^r,<5

by substantial evidence, they can then take it to the Court of

3

Claims.

4

Q,

Your authority for that is what? Just logic or —

5

A.

The correction statute and the legislative history,,

6

Your Honorj, and the wordings of the two statutes.
Q,

7

S

Section 16 -

Do any of the statutes say that this kind of a

determination may be reviewed in the Court of Claims?
A.

9

Nos Your Honor.

I know of nowhere where they say

10

a Court-Martial shall specifically be reviewed, but they have

n

reviewed - the Attorney General says the secretary can review

!2

this.
There is no basis in the history for distinguishing

13
14
15

between the decisions of the secretary —
Q

Well, I suppose if Shapiro was considered by the

16

Congress in the context of all of this, Shapiro at least

17

indicated that there was authority in the Court of Claims, and

!8

what you are saying, if I understand you, on the applications

19

made for review to the Board of Corrections of Records, that

20

they consider the same kind of prohibition review that we have

21

in 76 to begin with.

22

A.

Yes, Your Honor.

They considered whether to make thi;

23

binding final on the courts, and struck it out. That is in the

24

legislative history.

25

Q,

Do you have that in your brief?

6%

1

A.

Yes 9 Your Honor, I have cited in Ashe versus

2

McNamara which has a full discussion of It, which I have

3

referred from Ashe v. McNamara to the legislative history.

4

But in addition —

5

Q,

What brief is that you say you have it in?

6

A,

Q,

Mr. Steiner, you filed more than a memorandum on

opposition, did you not?
A.

Yes, Your Honor, I filed a brief, a reply brief for

the respondent, Kenneth N. Juhl.
Two circuits, the First and Tenth, have construed this

14
15

correction statute to give them authority to review Court-

16

Martial.

17

the other.

And Ashe v. McNamara is one.

Smith y. McNamara is

18

There is no decision saying that the courts cannot

19

look into Court-Martials under the correction board statute.

20

The only case close is this Davies v. Clifford which the

21

government cited, in which they said he received full relief

22

from the secretary, so he had no claim under that.

23
24
25

My main difference that I made with Augenblick was
the correction board statute, the fact that there was no review
whatsoever for this man, not even discretionary, and the fact

69

1

that this v;as jurisdictional.

2

under 153(a).

3
4

That was basic jurisdiction

The Court-Martial cannot base a conviction on the
i uncorroborated testimony of an accomplices where it is uncertain,
'

5

doubtful or improbable.

That was jurisdictionally told them.

6

Those three factors are the reasons that we respectfully ~

7

Q

To what extent must it be corroborated?

8

A,

I think if there is any corroboration, Your Konors

that it is corroborated.

But, for example, from the testimony

of the people who said, "Yes, he x-fas out here, but he did not

That cannot be corroboration, just because he

Q,

For the foregoing reasons —
I understand you now to be saying that despite 76,

despite the conviction, despite the Board of Appeals in the

4

Military, there is still a remedy provided in a code section

5

for an examination by board, and if they decide against the

6

men, the soldier there, he can have that .reviewed in the

/

Court of Claims.

A

Yes, Your Honor.

That is correct.

What is that code section that authorizes that?

No, Your Honor, but in the legislative history they

But it does not say in the statute and the Court of

You are right in that they have never reviewed a

Court-Martial, but two circuits have.

0,

15

I know, but you were saying the Court of Claims.

I thought those were habeas corpus cases.

14

A.

No, Your Honor, these were under the Correction

Board statute.

16

they did not hold in his favor in Smith, but they ruled that

17

they had jurisdiction in accordance with that.

Ashe, for example, was not in confinement, and

I take it there would be no limit on the nature of

the attack which the secretary or the board, under this

20

statute, entertained?

21

A.

The secretary could do anything, I believe.

In this section he could go in and say - there has

23

been an error here because there was not enough evidence to

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

5

MR. WEISL:

Mr. Weisl.

Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice —

6

Q

Was Certiorari sought in the Ashe case?

7

A

I do not believe it was, Mr. Justice Douglas.

3

Q,

Do you know?

S

A

I do not believe it was.
As to the board question, that has been the subject

10

1 'i

of extensive examination by the Court, there is a discussion in

12

our brief, footnote 31 on page ^6, and it is briefly our

13

position that legislative history of this statute provides

14

that there may be judicial review under appropriate circum­

15

stances .
The government, I feel certain, would take the

16
17

18
19

position that if the underlying action being reviewed by the
board was a Court-Martial," that the finality clause of Article
76 would bar judicial review of the board's decision.
A board decision, however —

20

21

22

Q

What does this mean?

j

I am reading from Ashe:

"In light of this history we are confident that the finality
j

23
24
25

provision as it now exists, a correction under this section is
final and conclusive on all officers of the United States, was
not intended to do any otherwise proper judicial review of

75

*

i

1

departmental action upon a petition to change the type of

2

disciplinary action."

3
4

A,

I think that case is clearly wrong to the extent

that it says you can review a board action —

5

Q

Is this contrary to your position, as I see it?

S

A

I think you will see from the Court of Claims

7

a
9

10

position in Juhl that they, too, question the power —
Q

May I ask you, then, what about the other case —

was there any proceeding before the Augenblick case, any effort
to get a proceeding before a correction board?

11

A.

To the best of my knowledge there was none.

12

0,

The point of fact was denied, as was in Juhl.

13

14

I do

not see any comparison between Ashe and your position here.
A

I say that if the question arose again whether the

15

board for the correction of records could be reviewed in court

16

when they have corrected a Court-Martial, we would urge that

17

Article 76 bars judicial review of that board action.

18

Finally, in conclusion, I would like to place this

19

case, both these cases, in perspective by saying what I think

20

we are all concerned about, and properly, is whether a military

21

defendant has access at some point to a civilian court to make

22

sure that he was not convicted on fundamentally unfair grounds

23

and by fundamentally unfair procedure.

24

And briefly, these are the instances under which a

25

military defendant can, at some point, get civilian review by
76
l

1

a civilian court.

2

the Court of Military Appeals or habeas corpus.

3

missed from the service, as was Augenblick, gets a bad conduct

4

or a dishonorable discharge, if he is an enlisted man, he can

He is imprisoned over one year, he can go to
He is dis­

i
5

go to the Court of Military Appeals, a civilian court.
5

6

If he is imprisoned for less than one year, true, he

7

must act promptly, but he can seek the remedy of habeas corpus,

8

and that remedy has been made much more meaningful by this

9

Court, because even if he properly applied for this writ, even

10

though his imprisonment is over and he has served his term, this

11

Court has recently held in the Carafas and LaVallee case that

12

he can review his habeas remedy and have his conviction expunged,

13

Therefore, only a petty area where a fine Is

14

imposed or a reduction in pay takes place is he foreclosed for

15

review by habeas or the Court of Military Appeals.

16

17

I think that this situation shows that fundamentally
the position that the government has urged is fair.

18

Thank you.
