ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF
MR. CLAIBORNE:

1

A
iQ

Mr. Justice Black, and may it please

the court.
Let me make clear at the outset that despite the

n

title of the case, this original action or this phase of this

12

original action, involves only the State of Texas., not

13

louisiana, as might ha otherwise indicated,

14

It is perhaps fitting that the court hear an apology

for

15

first for having to hear

the third time since the passage

16

of fhis Submerged Lands Act another aspect of this tidelands

17

controversy between the United States and Texas.

18

One might have hoped that eight terms ago, when the

19

Court decided that Texas, unlike most of the Gulf States, was

20

entitled to a historic claim in the Gulf, that historic claim

21

was based on the Republic of Texas Boundary Act, which defined

22

the Belt of Texas as 9 miles from land, and the Texas coast

23

being relatively uncomplicated, that might have been the end

24

of the matter.

2B

Unfortunately, however, there'were certain unresolved
2

1

matters which came before the court only at the last term.
The question then was, where do you start measuring

2
3

this

9-mile belt?

Was it from the present coast, or rather

4

from the historic coast -— that is, the coast in 1845.
The court there determined that it was measured, was

S
6

to be measured, this 9-mile historic belt of Texas had bean

7

adjudicated, that it was to be measured from the historic

a

coast, the coast in 1845, therefore, one could not take into

0

account artificial jetties that had been put outside of

10

harbors at Galveston.
When it came to translating the court's opinion into '

It
'12

a decree, we discovered that we had left another problem

13

unresolved.
It was easy, or it was done — it wasn't easy -— the

14

IS

parties did stipulate where the 1845 coast was, and that has

m

been stipulated in a written, signed stipulation which is before
i
the court.

17

Texas felt the next step was simply to measure 9

18
19

miles out from that, which was done, and that line has been

20

stipulated.
However,, the Submerged Lands Act contains a pro­

21

22
£3
24
25

vision that no State, not even the States in the Gulf of
Mexico is entitled to submerged lands atore than 9 miles from
its coast.
The United States takes the position that 9 miles
3

'I

from its coast for that purpose„ for the purpose of its

z

limitation, means 9 miles from the present coast, not from the

3

historic coast.
■
How, it so happens that the Texas coast has eroded

4
5

substantially over the last century.

6

drawings which has been distributed to the court indicates ths

7

extent roughly of the erosion and the extent of the accretion.

8

The portion shown in red indicates the erosion.

9

concerns us today,, because most of the coast has eroded rather

10

than, accreted, we do have a difference as to where this 9 mile

11

belt ends up, depending on where it begins.

One of the little

That is what
'

12

The real question is., as 1 said, whether this limi-

13

tation which Texas acknowledges, and which is stated in plain

14

words in the Submerged Lands Act, that no State shall take more :

IS

than 9 miles from the coast means from the present coast.

|

If it means from the present, coast, then we cannot

16
' ?

1

measure from the old coast because that would push the line

18

beyond 9 miles from the present coast.

19

How the effect of this ---

20

Q

Do you contemplate that different parts of the

2!

country, in different parts of the country, the States that

22

merge on the i^ater have a different coast?

A

Mr. Justice Black, the problem cannot arise with |

23

M

respect to any other State except Florida.

It arises with

'

2S

j

respect to those two States only because they have received

4

5

grants which come to the very edge of the maximum, the maximum

2

for any State being 9 miles.

3

Otherwise, the problem would never arise.

4

While Florida was maybe affected by the decision

5

here, and was duly notified of that fact, it chose not to

6

participate in this phase of the controversy.
As I say, the effect of this translated into one

7

a

small segment of the coast is depicted on the chart behind me,

$

a copy of which, in small form, has also been distributed to

!0

the court.

11

Texas.

12

This is a chart that was prepared by the State of

But it shows rather clearly what the difference is.

13

Last term we were arguing about the effect of accretion,

14

artificial accretion in that case, and the same principle

IS

applies to natural accretion, whether that pushed out the

16

9-mile belt.

17

The answer was it did not.

18

This time, we are arguing about whether the effect

10

of erosion is bringing in the line, because otherwise the

.20

line would be more than 9 miles from the present shore.

21

22

£3

j

j

Again, we say that this territory is not properly
attributable to Texas under the Submerged Lands Act.
You can see from just that statement that Texas

24

appears to have at two advantages in this case.

One is that

28

we appear to be saying, "Heads we win, tails we lose," whether
*
5
I

1

it is accretion or erosion, Texas gets the benefit of neither.
Secondly, our position results in a changeable„

2
3

movable line as the modern coast shifts? whereas Texas would

4

have a fixed, permanent line 9 miles from the stipulated 1845

5

coast, which would not be affected by any future changes one

8

way or the other,

a

Q

Your line could never move seaward, could it?

8

A

The line will move seaward from where it is

ten

9

today if there is accretion where there is presently erosion.
In other words, if this erosion should disappear, we

10

I!

would put the line here today.

Ten years from now if that

52

erosion is to be recaptured by the land that would shift the

f3

9 mile ——

14
15
16

Q

You would move both ways?

A

We would move both ways, in some areas.

'

Now, as I say, the superficial attraction of the
t

17
18

permanent line shich has already been stipulated, which would
certainly spare this court of any necessity of any future

10

litigation if the Texas position were adopted.

20

the simplicity, the attraction of that position.

21
22
23
24
25

We recognize

But. let me say as to the first point, the point that
we seem to be saying to Texas, no matter which way it shifts,
you don’t get the benefit of it.
That is not entirely true.
When there is a shift, when there is accretion of
6

1

snore than 6 miles,, whether that be by natural accretion, by

2

the building more lightly, by the building of a hobble work,

3

we would push the line out, because in that instance we would

4
3

say to Texas, "Mow you are taking not underthe historic claims,
>
you are taking 3 miles — which every State has a right to do

S

— from its modern coast.5’

7
8
9

This example is illustrated on pages 20 and 21 of
our memorandum.
That may be a small compensation for the other effect .

19

The reason it is a small compensation is simply because Texas

11

is in the unusual position of having a 9-mile belt, whereas

12

every other State but ones has a only a 3-mile belt.

13

Q

Do you find any basis in the past decisions in

14

this case for saying that the natural coast line, apart from

IS

the inland water problem, is the natural coast line is the

16

date of the passage of the Submerged Lands Act?

17

In other words, you seem to accept the view that

38

this is an ambulatory line, that it changes with accretion or

19

erosion, in the future?

'

20

A

I think in the California case, Mr. Justice

21

Harlan, with respect to a 3-mile line, I think the court was

22

explicit that that line would change, and it is provided by

23

the convention --

24

28

'

Q

That was with respect to inland waters.

nothing except inland waters in that case, did we not?

7

We had
We

1

weren’t concerned with anything except the definition of inland:

a

waters?

s

A

1 suppose that is true.

Perhaps X took the

4

proposition to apply equally when we are talking about the

3

shore line, that natural accretion or erosion to that shore

6

line, where that is the operating definition for the beginning

7

of the territorial sea --

8
9

Q

My recollection of that decision in the

California case was that it dealt only with inland waters,

10

and that, dealing at least in the inland water field, is what

11

is criticised now by Texas as being the effect of your rule.
I

12

We said, "Well, Texas could not affect the coast

13

line as far as inland waters are concerned because by building j

14

out new jetties and new harbors, because the Government under

15

its navigation, its power over navigational waters, could

16

always step in and prevent that sort of thing being done.

17

A

The court in the California case did advert

1©

to the Governmental power to prevent an exaggerated extension

19

of the coast by the State for its own benefit, which didn't

£0

serve a national or a navigational purpose.

21

X took it that discussion applies equally whether an j

22

extension of the inland waters are involved or an extension

23

of the natural coast line.

24
25

*
j

Q

Well, we didn’t deal with it.

X don’t think

you will find anything in that opinion, the California opinion
8

i

that deals with the natural coast line»

2

natural coast line, except as it is affected by the outer

3

limits of inland waters are»

4

A

I may be wrong,

Mr, Justice Harlan, I am not in a position to

'5

debate it.

6

case did in fact deal for segments with the shore as well as

7

with the line of inland waters.

8
9

I thought, and I am advised, that the California

I may be wrong about that.

It has certainly bean assumed by all parties since
that case, including the argument in the Louisiana case, a

10

month or so ago, that shifts in the shore line, when the

SI

shore line is the coast line, would affect the ultimate 3-mile

12

line, and that I think, is consistent with the International

13

Convention.

14

Of course, the court having held in the California

IS

cast that one and the other are the same, that is the inter­

16

national line and the national line, where the line is 3 miles

17

from the coast.

18

we are dealing with a 9-mile line.

19

This, of course, doesn’t apply to Texas, as

Let me say, and this bears on your Honor’s point,

20

that the appeal of the Texas position, that we here end up

21

with a fixed permanent line that would not move, would be an

22

unusual result, because, as I understand it, in every other

23

situation, we do in fact have a movable line -- certainly we

24

do where inland waters are involved, and I thought it was clear

25

that we do where shore line is the coast line.

Q

What is unusual, if property is sold at one time :

to a person*, why would it be unusual fox" the boundaries of the
property that he sold to be able?
A

As I understand it, ordinary property lav/, it

5

would normally if one owns the edge of a body of water,

6

norma. . ,y that ownership carries with it the right to the

7

accretions, therefore a shifting boundary, as well as a loss

8

by eroi’ .on if the water eats into the land, so that the normal

§

rule oi property of boundaries on water is that they do move

10

11
12
13

as the Water recedes or comes in.
Q

This would be governed, would it not, by what

Congress meant in the Submerged Lands Act?
A

Well, I thought, as I say, I may be wrong,

14

Mr. Justice Hack.

IS

determined that we were faced, whatever inconveniences might

1®

be to it, with a shifting line of those lands which have been
V7e did that in California.

17
18
13

But 1 thought the court had long since

Does that neces­

sarily mean the same rule applies all over the nation?
A

I only say that it. would be odd if it didn8t,

20

not that it is inpossible,

2!

line in the Gulf with respect to Texas, a movable line in the

22

Gulf with respect to Louisiana and Alabama and Mississippi.

23

Of course, one could have a fixed

It would simply be against the normal.

That is all

24

I am saying.

There is a more dispositive answer to all this

25

which is that the text of the Submerged Lands Act makes it

10

i

1

crystal clear that this 9-mile limitation beyond which no

2

Stats can bake, whatever its historic boundary was, this 9-rails

«ry

limitation reads from "The coast line *"

<l£>

That word is the same operative word that defines

4
5

the 3-mile grant»

That word is expressly defined in the

6

Submerged Lands Act in Section 2-C.

7

all purposes»

It is defined there for

It doesn't say, "As used in this subsection,"

Coast line means the same thing each time it is used

8

8

in the Submerged Lands Act, it has been defined by this court

1C'

to mean a measurement, the modern coast, the ambulating modern

11

coast.

12

this 9-mile limitation must also be measured from the modern,

13

ambulatory coast.

14

•

•

.

If I am right in that premise, then it follows that

The confusion here arises only because it so happens

15

that Texas' historic claim is 9-miles and the limitation is

16

also 9-miles, and there is a temptation to make the two read

17
18

on the same points.
The case would be far easier to view if there had

10

been a 12-mile historic claim by Texas,

20

was cognizable under the Submerged Lands Act,

21

22
23
24

25

Only 9 miles of which
In that case,
i

I don't think it would ever occur to anyone to go plot the
1845 shore line, because it would be evident that you only
took the first 9 miles of it.
Even clearer case perhaps would be if the boundary
historically in the case of Texas had, for instance, been set
11

1

for the southern part oh the 97th meridian,- without any

2

reference to the coast whatever.

3

In that case? it would be a great waste of effort to
■

4

go back and see where the coast was in 1845s, since the historic!

5

boundary was not related to the coast, but was set geographi-

$

eally arbitrarily.

'I

In that instance, one would of course read the 9-mile

3

limitation of the Submerged Lands Act grant as reading from

9

the modern coast,

10

Q

;;
Mr. Claiborne, perhaps I don't have this in mind

11

clearly, but as I understand it, thatTexas has been contending

12

for a maximum line out there three leagues from their 1845

13

coast line?

14

A

That is correct.

IS

Q

That is correct.

And you are contending for a

IS

maximum line in the gulf, three leagues out from their coast

17

line at any given time.

13

the briefs.

19

A

Exactly.

20

Q

Isn’t there, or is there not, a possible third

21

22
23
24
25

Now, or in the future, as you say in

j

alternative, and that is a maximum of 3 leagues out from the
;
coast line as of 1953, when the Submerged Lands Act was enacted'?,
I
A
There certainly was that alternative.

j
Q

The statute refers to the coast line, and could

not it be argued that the Congress meant to be referring to

12

3

coast line as it then and there existed on the date of the

£

enactment of the statute?
A

3

Exactly.,

Mr. Justice Stev/art, in fact I think

4

it was at one time the position argued by the United States.

£

I thought it had been the position argued by the United States

6

in the California case, and I thought it had been rejected by

7

the court, saying, "No, we donst look to 1953, we look to the

8

convention of the territory --

©

10

I

Q

That was only with reference to inland waters,
/
the inland waters part of the coast line. We took the inland

n

waters definition instead of what you are arguing, namely that

n

the practice of the State Department in 1953 should be taken

13

as the definite international definitions, so called, in

14

international waters.

f!

We rejected that and said here is the treaty which

1S
16

establishes it.

17

dealing with the question of accretions or erosions to the

18

natural coast line.

IS

That is all we were dealing with.

We weren't

A

I can only repeat and apologise for my ignorance

Q

Well, I am asking you, because it comes as a

20

Zi
22
23

24

'

surprise to me that -— it comes as a surprise to me, and that
is the reason I asked you the question as to whether we ever
indicated in any of our previous opinions that so far as the
-

£5

natural coast line is concerned, this was a movable affair.
13

I

A

I think, and this may be ---

2

Q

If I am wrong about that, I would like to have

3

the reference to the opinion,

4

A

I don’t have the opinion handy, Mr, Justice

5

Harlan,

6

whatever references wa can find.

I would certainly be glad to furnish to the court

■

7

Q

I may be wrong in these things, but —~

8

A

My best memory is that at least the decree in

©

the California case sat out the definition of coast line in
terms that at least implied a movable coast line when it

is

n

related to the natural shore, that is, where the natural shore

12

is in open contact with the sea.
*

13

I had taken it that that was the unanimous view of

14

the meaning of a boundary, an international boundary, under

15

the International Convention, that the court had adopted for

16

the purpose of inland waters the international rules, I had

17

supposed the same was true here, where the 3-mile limit, or

IS

in this case the 9-mile limit is defined by reference to the

39

shore rather than to the line of inland waters.

20

■.

Q

Well, assuxaing that the position has not been

3

21

precluded or forbidden by Mr. Justice Harlan’s opinion in the

'

22

California case, would it be a rational, third alternative, or |
I

23

argument, to say that the 3-league limitation from the coast

24

line means not the coast line of 1845, and not the present and

as

future coast line, wherever it may be, but the coast line as

y

14

1

was described by Congress, which enacted a statute referring

2

to it in the year 1953?,
A

3

I only see two difficulties with it, Mr, Justice

4

Stewart.

The first is simply one of determining the coast

5

line as of that time rather than as of now.

6

Q

That is always going to be a difficulty.

1

A

However, having done that for 1845, I suppose

8

we could manage it for 1953 -—

9

Q

It is comparatively easy, 308 years later.

1@

A

The more serious problem, I would think, was

1!

that once the court has adopted the rule that the 3-mile limit

12

internationally, and the 3-mile belt assigned to the States is

13

one and the same, then, of course, we would, be running against

14

a different rule followed by the State Department for inter­

15

national purposes in viewing the Convention, as establishing an

16

ambulatory line, even where that line is referenced to the

M

open coast.

18

Q

For international purposes of the coast, the

19

environmental context is quite different along the gulf

20

from the way.it is in the Atlantic and Pacific anyway, because of

21

the Continental Shelf and a variety of other things, isn't

22

that true?
A

Well, I don't say they need to be the same.

|

23
24

25

Nor need they be the same perhaps is less reason for them to

!

be the same in the Gulf than on the California coast, but there;

15

1

I suppose you couldn’t have two rules,, one for the Gulf of a

a

fixed line as of 1953, but in California one that ambulates.
Q

3

1 thought you had pointed out in this case,

4

the decision in this case would have a. reference to, would

5

have an impact only upon Texas and upon Florida, because of

6

our earlier decision?

7

A

Well, I meant to say perhaps you couldn’t have

8

a 1953 boundary all over the Gulf, even where it is 3 miles,

a

as in Louisiana, Alabama, or Mississippi, and yet have a

i© | different rule applying to California simply because inter­

ii

national considerations may be more important on the Pacific

12

and the Atlantic Coast than they are in the Gulf of Mexico.
'

But I would think one might also -- this is somewhat

13
14

hypothetical •— run across problems of a narrowing of that

IS

belt to the point where Texas would almost lose some of its

1©

lands, or Louisiana might if you got a very shifting boundary.
If you fix it as of any given time and there is a

17

substantial accretion, you presumably have no longer any water

18

1®

belt around you.

2©

consistent with, I think, normal property rules.
Q

21

The notion of the shifting belt is more

But, isn’t the basis of your discussion with

Mr. Justice Stewart would only be for the purpose of applying

22

the 3-league limitation?

23
24
25

A

Well, I don’t see, Mr. Justice White --

Q

Because the basic grant is on historic

boundaries?

1

IS

i

A

But one cannot texturally leave the 3-league

2

and the 3-mile stipulation in the Act as starting from a

3

different point.

4

Q

They both start from the coast line.

Again getting back, the outer limits, if there

5

were accretions to the coast line so that 3 leagues from the

6

present-day coast line extended beyond the historic boundaries

7

of Texas, the historic boundary would be the line, wouldn't it? |

8
9

A

No, then Texas uwould be entitled to the 3 mile, j

which every state is entitled to.

It would no longer take

10

under its historic grant, it would take under the all-states

1!

grant of 3 miles.

12

j

It would shift the basis for its grant, as we
.

13

illustrate on page 21.

If the land goes out to the point where the distance
between the historic boundary and the land is no longer 3 miles

I take it the basic grant was out to historic

Subject to this limitation.

Q

Yes, and let us suppose that then there was,

that the historic boundary at that time was exactly 3 leagues

from the coast, and then there- was accretion, at that point.

Yes.

The Texas grant doesn't move shoreward does it?

13

The only reason we argued it was not is because Texas

14

took under the historic claim which must be judged by the facts

15

of history, not by the changing facts of today.

16

Q

j

Except Texas took, in last term's case, and in

17

fact Texas6 claim is under a definition of the 1953 Act, which

18

did not contain the word "coast line" which is the boundaries

10

as they existed at the time such State became a member of the
.

20

Union, and that another division of the Act to be, establishes

2!

a maximum, as you pointed out, but the definition under which

22

they claim does not contain the phrase "coast line."

23
24
25

j

Is that right?
A

That is entirely correct, and as I understand itJ

j
that is the basis of the decision and your Honor made it

18

abundantly clear in the concurring opinion that that was the
basis of your concurrence.
Let me end on this, that I do not think one can
consistent with the text say that the coast line for the
5

purpose of the 9-mile limitation is something fixed as of 1953,

§

but that for the purpose of the 3-mile grant, it may be a

7

shift, because both statements, that is, a statement of the

8

limitation and the statement of the 3-mile grant, are both

9

referenced to the single words "coast line," and those words

10 I are defined once and for all, for all purposes, in Section 2-C

12

of the Act,
It cannot mean one thing one time and another thing

another time.

modern coast, as it may be at any given time.

We have submitted decrees to the court premised on
our disagreement as to theory.

However, we both agree with

each other that if the Government"s theory, the United States
theory, prevails, its decree should, be ended.

if Texas is correct of the law it wshould be ended.

That is the simple truth of the

We were told quite plainly in the opinion that what

n

Congress intended was to give us back what we had in 1845,

12

all that area that we had in 1845, and even one sentence in the

33

majority opinion states that it is extremely clear that no

and they are talking about this historical claim, simply is
being given the same area it had when it entered the Union.
Well now there is only one possible way to do that,

m

and that is to use a fixed, historic boundary.

19

erosion is going to take away something from Texas.

20

the only possible way to give that effect to the Congressional

intent is to measure from the fixed historic 1845 boundary as

It was put in there because Texas and Louisiana,

unilaterally by legislation of their own states, to shove their

boundaries out to the edge of the Continental Shelf,

15

A

Yes, you are right.

You are right.

I was

looking at the wrong scale.
Q

So that this erosion, as I understand it, is a

slow process, and so is accretion?

Yes, that is right.

So you are right, it is not

20

nearly that far out, nor does it cover a very wide area, as

21

far as that is concerned.

As I said, it makes a difference — we are not really
sure how much.
But we do not believe that the court should allow
this proposition.

You can use the 1845 boundary when if. hurts

25

In one sense, Mr. Justice Black, that is true.

Why should you use two tests, one of which goes

to the disadvantage of Texas and one of which is to the
advantage?
A

We are dealing with two quite separate provisions,

one is the provision which the court held last term determines
the extent of the historic claim, it being a historic claim
31

1
i:b
&9

it was properly to be measured from the historic shore»

That

is what the court held.

3

That is, of course, what we argued last time.

4

Now, we are dealing with something quite different.

S

We are dealing with a maximum limitation which is stated to be

6

from a coast line.

7

to those states which --- well, not only to Texas in terms.

8

applies to any State which is able to show a valid historic

9

claim.

Right.
But it applies to all the Gulf States, and it

simply says' that you may take as much as you had when you came
into the Union, but no more than 9 miles from the coast.
And the coast is then defined for that purpose as
well as for the purpose of the 3-raiXe grant which every State
gets, and 1 can only say I thought it had been decided by the
court that that meant the modern coast, not the historic coast,
not the 1953 coast, but the modern coast as it shifts from
time to time.

Q

Well, Mr. Claiborne, just one last question,

Do you agree with Mr. Brownlee, that that proviso
is a response to this 1943 case?
A

This proviso was added as I understand it on

j

6

the floor rather as without much explanation.

1

however, or one I think can fairly deduce that the 9-mile

8

limitation was in response to the very exorbitant or at least

$

very self-generous claims made by Texas and Louisiana, and

10
11
12
13

It. does appear,

i

perhaps also by Louisiana and Alabama.
Q

Well, if that is so, wouldn’t that argue against

your idea that the coast line means the present coast line?
A

Ho, for instance, in the case of Louisiana,

14

the claim was not a stated number of leagues from the coast,

IS

or at least the definition of the coast began so far out that

IS

it is a practical matter they were 20 miles or so out into the

17
18
13

Gulf, and there were boundaries set with straight lines that had
no relation to the coast.
So, as it applied to Louisiana, this 9-mile limi­

2©

tation couldn’t be measured from any historic shore line.

21

would have to be measured from the modern shore line.

22

Q

It

Well, but in the case of Texas, what Congress

23

wanted to be sure that the limitation gave them no more than

24

what they had back in 1845,

25

It might mean that coast line

meant coast line of 1.845.
33

f

A

Had Texas been the only State against which

2

this limitation was designed3 and since it happened that

3

Texas had a 9-mile claim, one might have made the inference

4

yoi^r Honor suggests .

5

Since, however, it is equally fair to read this

6

limitation as reading as Louisiana it had a different sort of

7

claim, 1 don't think the conclusion is warranted.
