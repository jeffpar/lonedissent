ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS X. BEYTAGH, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

Counsel are present.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

6

No. 228, John T. Willingham

MR. BEYTAGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.
In certain respects this case involves a rather narrow
and somewhat technical issue of Federal procedures, but under­
lying it are some important questions that relate to notions
of Federal supremacy involve issues of importance to prison
officials and to Federal Governmental officials generally.
The issue in a nutshall is this:

A Federal statute,

15

Section 1442(a)(1) of Title 28 of the United States Code,
16

provides that suits against Federal officers may be removed
17

when brought in a State court to a Federal court where the'
13

*

acts that are alleged to have occurred upon the basis of the
19

suit occur when the officer is acting under "color81 of his
20

office.
21

22
23
24

We have set the statute out at page 2 of our brief.
provides in pertinent part as follows:

It

"A civil action or

criminal prosecution commenced in a State court against any
of the following persons may be removed by them to the District

25
2

1

Court of the United States for the District and division

2

embracing the place wherein it is pending.
"1.

3

Any officer of the United States or any agency

4

thereof or person acting under him for any act under color of

5

such office."
The issue arises here on the following facts.

6

Respondent

7

Daniel Morgan was a prisoner at the Federal Penitentiary at

8

Leavenworth, Kansas.
He had been transferred there in March 1966, and in July,

9
10
11
12
13
14

1966, some four months later, filed the damage action which
is the subject of this suit in a Kansas State court.
Petitioners Willingham and Jarvis are the warden and, were
then, warden and chief medical officer of the Federal
Penitentiary at Leavenworth.
They were the only named defendants in respondent Morgan's

15
16
17
18
19

20
21
22
23
24

suit.

There were 75 unnamed co-defendants.

He sought a

total recovery in excess of $90 million in damages.

He alleged

in some ten counts a variety of tortious acts that he said had
been perpetrated upon him by petitioners Willingham and Jarvis
and the other 75 people.
In substance his complaints can be boiled down to two
issues.

He asserted that he had been innoculated with some

dangerous foreign substance which had caused him to fall and
injure himself, and that in the course of this innoculation
unauthorized people had been giving him medical assistance.

25
3

1

And in another count he asserted in cdnclusory fashion

2

that he had been beaten and assaulted and tortured in various

3

respects.

4

Petitioners Willingham and Jarvis filed a general denial

5

in State Court denying all the allegations in the ten-count

8

complaint that had been filed by respondent.

7

They also filed* pursuant to Section 1442(a)(1) a verified

8

petition for removal of this action from the Kansas State Court

9

to the Federal District Court for the District of Kansas.

10

In this removal petition they asserted that at all relevant

11

times they had been acting in their official capacities as wards

12

and chief medical officer of Leavenworth Penitentiary* and they

13

set out the various counts of the complaint and then at page 9

14

of the record they said that Morgan was at all times mentioned

15

a duly committed prisoner inmate of the Federal Penitentiary

16

at Leavenworth and further that any act or thing that these

17

petitioners or either of them may have done or authorized

18

to be done concerning Morgan complained of by him was done and

19

made by them in the course of their duties as officers of the

20

United States of American and as persons acting under officers

21

of the United States of America, and under color of such office

22
23
24
25

and by virtue thereof.
And they again refer to their offices as warden and chief
medical officer.
Morgc-m then filed a

motion in the Federal District Court
4

1

to remand the case back to the State Court.

2

a variety of respects that petitioners were not acting under

3

color of office when they committed the acts he alleged they

4

had committed.

5

He asserted for

He also filed a rather extensive set of interrogatories

8

on petitioner Willingham directed in substantial part to

7

obtaining the names of the unnamed, unidentified co-defendants.

8

With the District Court's approval an enlargement of

9
10

time to answer these interrogatories was obtained.
The next step was petitioners filing a motion for summary

11

judgment in the Federal District Court on the ground that

12

Morgan's suit should, be dismissed under the so-called official

13

immunity doctrine which has been established by this Board as

14

relating to executive officials as well as judicial and

15

legislative officials in cases dating back to Spalding versus

16

Vilas and going through Barr versus Matteo.

17

Petitioners at that point filed a fairly extensive

18

affidavits which are set out at pages 44 through 48 of the

19

printed appendix.

20

warden and chief medical officer at Leavenworth and stated

21

that the only contact that they had had with Respondent Morgan

22

was within the prison walls of Leavenworth and was in the course:

23

of their official duties as warden and chief medical officer.

24

Respondent Morgan opposed dismissal on a variety of

25

grounds.

Those affidavits detailed their duties as

The District Court in August of 1966 denied the
5

1

motion of respondent Morgan to remand the suit to the State

2

Court, finding that removal was proper under Section 1442(a)(10

3

and writing a short opinion in that regard.

4

Subsequently in December of 1966, the District Court

5

granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment and dismissed

6

the suit.

7

District Court’s determination that the suit was covered by

8

the official immunity doctrine and that not only had it been

9

properly removed but that it was subject to dismissal.

10

In substance the basis for the dismissal was the

Respondent Morgan then appealed to the Tenth Circuit

11

from this judgment and both parties frankly thought that the

12

issue before the Tenth Circuit related to whether the District

13

Court had properly determined that the prerequisites for the

14

official immunity doctrine had been met, and the case was

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

briefed and submitted on the brief to the court on that basis.
However, in deciding the case the Tenth Circuit found it
unnecessary to reach the question of whether the official
immunity defnese was properly invoked here.

Instead it,

although it started out by saying and spent most of its opinion
discussing the nature of the interrelationship between the
official immunity standard and the so-called color of office
test removal, it concluded that the District Court had erred
in finding that the suit had been properly removed.
It said that the color of office test for removal was
much narrower and that is a quote from the Court of Appeals
6

1

opinion than the standard of official immunity.

2

it determined that the District Court did not have an adequate

3

basis on which, on the record that existed, on which to

4

determine that removal was proper and it reversed the District

5

Court's decision, not reaching the official immunity question,

6

and remanded for a factual determination in its words, of the

7

question whether removal was proper.

And, therefore,

8

Q

What was the issue that was open on remand?

9

A

As I understand it, the Court of Appeals said that

10

the District Court needed a more adequate factual basis for

11

making a determination as to removal and that is the issue

12

that the District Court is directed to address itself to on

13

remand.

14

The Court of Appeals did mention in passing that quite

15

curiously that it thought that perhaps the standard for

16

dismissal on the basis of official immunity might have been

17

made out here, but nonetheless it didn't feel that the standard

18

of color of office for removal had been satisfied.

19

20

21
22
23
24
25

We brought the case here on petition of certiorari, which
the court granted, for several reasons.
The case has great potential for substantial mischief if
left standing.

There is, as respondent concedes, an obvious

relationship between the official immunity doctrine and the
color of office test for removal when suits are brought against
Federal officers in State courts, as often they are, and
7

1

peculiarly, prison officials such as are involved in this

2

case can be subjected to harassment by bringing, and having

3

to defend against these kind of suits if the standard that the

4

Court of Appeals has now erected is left standing.

5

So we agree with the Tenth Circuit in only one respect

6

and that is that the question that must be considered is the

7

interrelationship of the official immunity doctrine and the

8

color of office test under the removal statute.

9

We think, however, that the Court of Appeals is manifestly

10

wrong in concluding that the color of office test is narrower

11

than the official immunity defense.

12
13
14
15

We think that simply stands the law on its head because
the result of that is that any suit proper for removal would
automatically be disraissable.
And Congress, therefore, would have done a rather empty

16

act in providing a Federal forum to do nothing but dismiss

17

suits.

18

to enjoin the suit.

19

Q

In effect, petition for removal would be an action

Every suit that would be removable should be
*

20
21

22
23
24
25

dismissed according to the Tenth Circuit?
A

That is the way we understand it and plus

Q

And plus some that would not be removable would also

be dismissable.
A

Is that right?

As I understand the Tenth Circuit's opinion, yes, sir,.

Assuming that the State Courts would apply'would be.
8

i

0

z

Q

3

Yes.
But evary suit that id dismissed is not removable,

isn’t that what the Tenth Circuit said?

4

A

That is correct, yes,

5

Q

And what do you think is wrong with that?

6

A

I think a number of things ——

7

Q

In terms of possible mischief»

8

A

8

I think that the mischief is apparently the Tenth

Circuit would require that extensive factual inquiry be made

10

to determine the threshold issue of removal and if that is so,

11

then many of the purposes which the official immunity doctrine

12

is supposed to serve would be disserved by this notion, because

13

you would put these officers to the kind of burden that Barr

14

versus Matteo and the related doctrines are supposed to pro­

15
16
17
18
19

20
21
22.
23
24
25

tect them against.
Q

I suppose that assumes that the immunity doctrin'e

also implies a right to have your immunity adjudicated in the
Federal Court?
A

Well, I think Congress has made the judgment that

these suits in the main should be determined in Federal Courts.
Q

Because of the removal?

A

Because of the removal provision.

Q

But if State Courts would apply the Federal standard

of immunity, and the officers resorted to that in the State
Court, they would not be disadvantaged, would they?
9

1

A

I am not sure whether they would or not.

1 think

2

Congress has made the judgment, as I said, that these suits

3

should be — the Federal officer have a right to have these

4

suits determined in a Federal Court.

5

Now we are not taking the position that every suit that

6

is removed should be dismissed.

7

in other circuits where I think they have properly construed

8

the removal stattJte, they found removal proper, but have

9

determined that the suit is not dismissable under Barr

10

11

Indeed a number of suits that

versus

Matteo and the case goes on for trial.
Q

Well, the Tenth Circuit relied on certainly other

12

authority for their rules, such as the cases wherein there is

13

a negligent performance of an operation in a Government

14

hospital?

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

A

There was one District Court case in that respect.

The other cases it relied on

were all motor vehicle negligence

cases.
Q

That is right.

Well, how about those cases?

How about the negligence

cases?
A
problem.

I think the negligence cases present a difficult
It is no longer a viable one because Congress has

taken care of that by statute by providing that where motor
vehicle negligence suits involve actions done within the
scope of an employee's performance they become suits against
10

1

the United States under Section 2679, I believe as amended.

2

But our position is basically those suits are wrong.

3

Q

Are removable?

4

A

That is correct.

But I should note the Tenth Circuit

5

completely ignored a whole host of Court of Appeals authority,

6

and cited a District Court decision, but there are at least

7

three Courts of Appeals that have squarely faced this issue.

8

The Second Circuit, the Fourth and Fifth.CLrcuits have concluded

9

exactly the opposite and any comparison of the reach of these tv o

10

11

concepts, they have reached the opposite conclusion.
I should note that you asked about the mischief that may

12

come from this.

1.3

fact that this doctrine won't relate simply to prison officials

14

but would relate to Federal officials generally.

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

It is another problem and it involves the

Some Federal officials do some things in some places in
this country that are not popular.

Indeed the whole notion

of removal stemmed from that.
The first statute was in 1815 and had to do with the
opposition by some Mew England States in the War of 1812.

It

was limited to custom officials but it provided a way for
Customs Officers of the United States to remove suits brought
against them when they were inforcing the customs laws to a
Federal Court, instead of being sued in the State Court.
It goes on through the nullification controversy of 1833
where it was extended to revenue officers.
11

The statute has

1

been successively expanded to include officers of both Houses

2

of Congress and officers of the courts and then was expanded

3

in 1948 to include all Federal officers.
Q

4

I beg your pardon.

Suppose a prison guard beats a

5

prisoner.

6

you think that is under the color of office, too, and removable?
A

7

And that suit is brought and it is so alleged.

Do

I think that there may be a difference between a

8

prison guard and a senior prison official such as the indi­

9

viduals involved here.

10
11

12
13
14
15

18

21

22
23
24
25

A

Because I think that the problem in making the factual

was substantially more difficult as we have tri’ed to delineate
in a short reply brief for the file, for senior officials such
as these people.
There are over 2,000 prisoners at Leavenworth.

For them

to recall what they were doing on a particular day and whether
they had anything to do with this man at all.
Q

19

20

Why?

determination that apparently the Tenth Circuit was required,

16
17

Q

Well, that goes to the question of burden.

Maybe

the burden -— that isa question of burden and a question of
proof, but why should there be a different rule as to the
removal as to the case of a prison guard and in the case of
a person, of the warden or chief physician.

I don't understand

it.
A

A prison guard, it seems to me, there may be
12

1

circumstances under which suits brought against him are not

2

removable. He obviously has some authority to exercise

3

discipline over prisoners but obviously he can go beyond that

4

and abuse it.

Now this court has construed in cases like Classic and
Monroe versus Pape and Screws versus the United States,
analogous provision which relates to actions under color of
law by State officers.
And the approach taken there has been that even misuse
of power clothed with authority provides the statutory requisite
of the color of law.
1 think there may be circumstances in which prison guards
go so beyond the scope of -Q

I gave you a very simple case, and I thought your

answer was going to be that it would be removable.

Prison

guard is charged with complaints filed against prison guards
for beating up a prisoner to his injury.

Then is that removable;

or is it not under the statute?
A

I would have to know more about it.

I would have to

know whether the guard was able to file a verified, swear to
20
21

a .removable petition.
Q

You are getting back to the Tenth Circuit position

22

in supporting it.

The complaint is filed, and the complaint

23

merely alleges that the prison guard beat up this prisoner and
24

injured him and he suffered damages which he is now claiming.
25

13

1

And petition for removal is filed, the prison guard says

2

I didn't do it.

3

before then, that is exactly what the Tenth Circuit has said

4

here on which you are complaining of before this court.

5

A

You say that there has to be a trial of fact

No, your Honor.

You added the point that he is

6

able to verify that he didn't do it.

7

agree that it is --

8
9
10

11
12
13
14
15
16

Q

I am saying that he denied, he files a denial that

he did it.
A

If he can do that, I

Think that is enough?
I think if whe can swear to an affidavit that he did

not do these things alleged, then the suit is removable.
If, however, in some cases that this court has considered,
such as Soper and Simes involves situations where in your
hypothetical, the Guard obviously had something to do with
the individual.
There was some altercation, there was some action; he was
there and something happened, and so that presents a more

17
18
19

difficult case.
Q

Are you making any distinction between the prison

guard because he is a guard on the one hand and the warden
20

because he is a warden on the other hand?
21

A

I think in terms of the — how elaborate a statement

22
is required in order to justify removal.

There may be some

23

difference.
24

Q

Well, in these cases you have got exactly the same

25

14

\

•thing.

2

says I didn’t do it.
If you want to go beyond that, it seems to me that you

3

4.

The prisoner said he did it and the guard or the warden

are agreeing with the Tenth Circuit.
A

5

No, I don't agree with theTenth Circuit.

But I

6

suggest is that there may be some difference if the individual

7

is not able to respond by filing a verified removal petition

8

that he-- -

9

Q

10

Mr. Beytagh:

11
12

there is immunity in this case?
A

18
19

22

Of course, the District Court did.

is available to the Court, that it can uphold the District
Court's determination in that regard, of course, the Government
feels that that is fine.

On the other hantj we are not urging

that ——
Q

Do you think that maybe what we ought to do is to

decide only the question of removal and then remand to the
Court of Appeals?
A

23
24

The Tenth

If the Court feels that on the basis of the record that

20
21

We have not urged the Court to do that.

Circuit didn't reach it.

15
16

Suppose we should disagree with the Tenth Circuit,

Do you think that we should then confront the issue of whether

13
14

What I really started out to ask you is this,

Well, quite properly, your Honor, that is the only

question the Court of Appeals and it is a little bit difficult
I to

urge the Courts go beyond that, but as I said, we would not

25

15

1

2

be upset by that approach, either»
I was going to mention in response to Justice White's

3

question, that there is some real potential for mischief

4

here in the Tenth Circuit's narrow reading of the removal

5

statute,,

6

And two cases I think show why this is so.

One case is called Perez versus Rhiddlehoover.

It was

7

brought by Leander Perez down in Louisiana against Federal

8

voting examiners, in a State Court, seeking to prevent them

9

from carrying out the functions that Congress had charged

10

11
12
13
14
15
16
17
10
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

them with carrying out.
Now, they sought to remove that case, the question
there was whether they were acting under color of office.
Now if Federal officials seeking to enforce laws like
this are required to come forward with a substantial showing
that they were acting within the scope of their official
duties, and the dely and the harassment and the addictiveness
that comes from that is permissible, then I think that there
is some real mischief.
Another case, the Court is familiar with, Norton versus
McShane, which came out of the Meredith incident at the
University of Mississippi, where suit was brought by indi­
viduals down in Mississippi against Marshall McShane and
others.
Their removal was sought in the State court and it was
granted.

But if you read the statute narrowly and you can't
16

i

obtain removal without a thorough-going extensive factual

2

inquiry, then there is a real potential for mischief and

3

hazards.

4

We think the plain language of the statute itself supports

5

our reading.

6

his official duties.

7

mentioned the courts construed other similar provisions in

8

a broad fashion.

9

is more or less conceded that the Tenth Circuit's result is

10

It says color of office.

It doesn't say within

It says under color of office.

As I

Also it seems to us that while respondent here

indefensible, his position is not satisfactory either.

11

In short he says while the Tenth Circuit may have erred

12

in determining the comparative reach of the two statutes, it

13

did not err in determining that the record was inadequate for

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

the District Court to determine the question of removal.
We think on the facts presented and the reasons developed
at some length in our brief and in our reply brief that this
simply is not so and that if you say at least to officials like
these they must do more than they have done here, deny the
charges, assert that all the actions occurred within the prison
walls, and assert that anything that was done occurred within
the color of their office, that inevitably you are going to
have the extensive kind of litigation on this threshold issue
that is going to defeat most of the purposes of the official
immunity doctrine and I think also subvert Congress' intent in
enacting the statute.
17

1

Q

When was this statute passed?

2

A

This particular statute dates back to, well 1815 was

3

the first time the removal statute was passed.

That related

4

to customs officers and it has been expanded since that time.

5

In 1948 it was expanded to include all Federal officers.

6

Q

What brought about the passage of the law?

7

A

The passage of the first law as I understand had to do

8

Mr. Snee.

MR. SNEE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.

This is a rather unique case, in that the Respondent here
would submit to the Court that the result reached by the Court
of Appeals was quite correct, but for the wrong reasons.
We made clear in our brief there is neither reason nor
authority to support the views expressed by the Court of Appeals
in the Tenth Circuit on the alleged interrelationship between
the immunity standards and the color of office test.
However, we say that the Court was correct in reaching
its result.

We do not concede, as counsel just stated, that

the result was incorrect.

And we say that for the reason that

the record in this case was clearly inadequate, both under
25

18

s

Section 1446(a), title 28 of the Code, and prior decisions of

2

this court clearly inadequate to support Federal jurisdiction

3

on removal.

If one fact stands out in this case, it is that the record
is singularly devoid of facts.

The only uncontroverted fact

in the record as was pointed out by the Court of Appeals is
that at all times the only contact which the Petitioner had
with the Respondent were within the walls of Leavenworth Prsion.
In some of the cases, in the case which was cited by the
]ourt involving automobile accidents, the majority saw there was
io color of office on the part of the driver of the automobile
md, therefore, no removability, a matter which is now corrected
...»

i different section.
In none of those cases, however, was immunity involved,

15
16

-learly there is no immunity under Barr versus Matteo on the
>art of an automobile driver was being charged with negligence,

17
le is not exercising any sort of discretionary act.
18
19

One case, Braun versus McBurnett, involving 1442(a)(3),
:ourt officials, held there was a right of removability for two

20

ieputy marshals transporting a Federal prisoner to a peniten2!

:iary because they were in the performance of their duties under
22

:hat section of the statute and clearly again there was no
23

.mmunity.
24

Now the question of as, as the Respondent sees it, is one
25

19

1

of right of removability, is one which is deferred by statute

2

and the requirements of the statute must be met.

3

Congress didnot see fit if indeed it could do so, did not

4

see fit to allow removability of every case of prosecution against

5

a Federal officer simply because he is a Federal officer.

S

the various sections of this statute, various tests are put

7

down for the different categories of a person who are covered,

8

and as a District Court case has said, Congress knew what it

9

meant, knew how to say what it meant in these statutes, and it

10

11

In

put down under color of office.
This Court, Section 1446(a) requires that the petition

12

contain a plain and short statement of facts.

13

however, with that bare statutory requirement because this

14

court in two cases, Maryland versus Soper and Colorado versus

We are not left,

Symes, where there was a far more detailed statement of facts
than is present in this record, in both cases held that the
case should be remanded to the District Court, to the State
Court.
Q

Those were both cases that involved revenue agents?

A

Prohibition agents that come under the revenue part

of this statute, yes.
Q

Right.

That was a criminal case, and the episode-- ■

They were both criminal cases, your Honor.

It goes far toward carrying the burden of

Well, your Honor, that allegation is made first in

the affidavit supporting the motion for summary judgment.

And

was evidently cast in terms of Barr versus Matteo an immunity
rather than removability.
And if it does not seem facetious, I would say that it is
not misinterpreting the mind of this Court in Barr versus Matteo
to say that the outer perimiter of duty is measured by the
walls of Leavenworth Penitentiary.
But it is the only uncontroverted fact.

Now in Maryland

versus Soper, it was clear that the officers were present in the
performance of their duty but that this Court held that is not
sufficient because they had to show that they were doing nothing
other than official duties at the time this homicide occurred.
And they had not by the candid, specific positive statement
of facts given the Court a basis upon which to reach this
determination.
Bot the petitioner and the respondent engaged in a battle

25

21

1

of conclusionary statements which would be inadmissible as

2

evidence» Color of office is a conclusion of law which must be

3

made by the Court on the basis of facts by the person who

4

seeks removal, and the burden of proof is upon him, quite

5

differently from the situation which existed in Nortbn versus

6

McShane, where a conclusionary affidavit by the Attorney General

7

they were acting in the performance of their duty was regarded

8

as sufficient because there as in every case the burden of proof

9

was on the plaintiff and he had made no attempt to controvert

10
It
12
13

this statement.
The fundamental error respondent submits was even comparing
these two concepts of immunity and of removability.
They are different in origin, they are different in purpose

14

they are different in test, and they are different in effect.

15

And to try to compare the two of them is like asking is a horse

16

better than a cow.

It is along two different orders, two dif­

ferent categories.

Each should stand upon its own two feet.

17
13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

For the reasons that have been suggested why the petitioner
in their brief and after a very careful analysis of the opinion
of the Court of Appeals as distinguished from its judgment, I
think it is incorrect to say that the removal power, the
removal test was far narrower than the immunities standard.
But for the same reasons it is also incorrect to suggest
as petitioners do, that the removal power is far wider.
are different orders and different categories.
22

They

And we have been

told that the decision of the court below

puts the law on

I would suggest to try to establish the jurisdiction of a
court under the removal statute by determining that immunity

5

was present is putting the cart before the horse, and we must

have jurisdiction established before entering into the immunity

question.

And the record in this case does not sustain that burden
of proof which this court has recognized.
Q

What do you say would have to be alleged in order to

show that it was under color of office?
A

Perhaps I can best answer that question, Mr. Justice

Black, by saying what was not alleged, in this case.
In the affidavit which was submitted -Q

You could say, couldn't you, what has to be alleged?

A

Well, I shall, your Honor. They have to allege some

fact which ties the alleged act into their official duties.
In their affidavit there was a long list of their official
duties, but I think it is highly significant that no where in
that affidavit do they even mention any of the incidents which
were raised in the respondent's complaint.
They do not make the slightest effort to tie those in,

22

and they would only have to do it with regard to one act in
23

order to prefer jurisdiction upon the Federal Court.
24

Q

Do they show where it happened?

25

23

1

A

No.

2

Q

Is there any complaint about where it happened?

3

A

In their petitions, your Honor?

Q

Yes.

A

No.

The plaintiff's case, anything in the plaintiff's

A

Yes, the plaintiff is very detailed complaint.

Why does he say it happened?

He does not say so.

He just says that he was sub-

jacted to these particular-- Q

Well, it was in the prison?

A

It was in the prison, your Honor.

Q

How do you know that?

A

He says so, and this is not controverted by either

party.

He says that the warden and the chief medical officer

were not acting within the color of their office.
Q

You say that the fact that it happened in the prison

isn't enough?
A

That is not enough, your Honor, because other than

official acts may be committed within prisons.

And with regard

to the question of Mr. Justice Fortas raised, I think that it
might be fairly easy to establish removability in the case of
the prison guard, but certainly not immunity.
Q

Did they say what he is?

The defendant?

All the interrogatories which were submitted by

respondent in several places raise some question as to whether
ne was actually acting as warden at the time some of these facts,
the alleged facts, were committed.
Q

Why would that be necessary in the statute intended

a man is in a prison and a warden, and is there guarding a
prisoner, isn't it enough to say that he is the warden in order
to get removed.
A

Why would you have to go any further?

Because that merely establishes, your Honor, that he

is a Federal officer.
Q

It establishes that he is a Federal officer inside the

prison and that this man was a prisoner.
22
23
24

A

It does not establish that every act which he commits

within the prison is under color of office.

He made that

What are his charges?

The charges of the ---

That he charged the warden with having done?

4

A

He charges the warden with having knocked him to

the ground --

6

Q

In the prison?

7

A

In the prison.

Now there are circumstances where

8

such an act might be under color of office and there are cir­

9

cumstances where it might not be.

10

Q

Well, wouldn't that be -- carry with it an inference

11

unanswered that what he did was to knock him down while he was

12

attending to his duties as a guard?

13
14
15

A

Well, that may be, your Honor, except We do not think

it meets the test put down by this Court in those two cases.
Q

I wonder if the matter of burden of going forward

16

may be relevant here.

17

somewhere that these injuries, the alleged tort took place in

18

the prison.

19

in the interrogatories which were not answered.

20
21

22
23
24
25

Now, let us assume that it was alleged

I have a little difficulty in finding that, except

But let us assume that it was alleged that the injury took
place in the prison.

Let us assume that it is alleged or

stipulated that the defendants were and are officers of the
prison, and then I wonder if it — and a petition for removal
is filed — I wonder if that does not then shift the burden
of going forward to the plaintiff, the prisoner, and if that is
26

1

so, what did the prisoner do to go forward with the verified

2

allegations here tending to demonstrate that the action of the

3

warden and the chief physician was outside of the scope of

4

their office?

5

A

Well, Mr, Justice, it is perfectly true that the burden

8

of going forward in such a case, in the case of removal of

7

power, is upon the other party, not upon the person seeking

8

removal.

9

1?

12

But the burden of proof does not shift.
Q
forward.
A

What did he do with respect to the burden of going
Is there anything in this record?
There is nothing in the record which would suggest

13

the burden of going forward exists, because it does not exist

14

until there is some factual basis put forth.

15
16
17

IS
19
20

Q

Well, let us assume for the moment that we should

conclude that where it is alleged that injuries took place
within the prison, that the — where it is shown that the
defendants are officials of the prison, just assume with me for
the moment that we would conclude that that sets up a prima
facie case for removal.
\

21

22
23
24
25

And let us assume further that the burden of going forward
beyond that point ymi see is on the plaintiff prisoner to make
some further allegations that tend to show, for example, that
the warden and the physician acted outside of the scope of
their office in doing the acts complained of here.
27

1

What I am asking is, is there anything in the record here

2

setting forth allegations, verified allegations by the prisoner

3

contending to show that the physician and the warden proceeded

4

outside of the scope of their official duties?

5

A

Well, your Honor, the conclusionary statements of the

6

petitioners were met by an equally conclusionary statement of

7

the respondent.

8

Q

And did the Court act on that?

9

A

The District Court evidently did, your Honor.

10

Q

Did either one object to it?

11

A

No, your Honor, this question v?as not really liti­

gated in the District Court to any extent.

It was a motion to

remand prepared by a motion to deny.
Q

And the parties chose to submit to the Court on the

allegations of the pleadings up to that time?
A

Yes, your Honor.

Q

Then why do we need to go any further?

A

Because this is a question of jurisdiction, your

Honor.
Q

Under the Federal Statute.
Does that change it.

Take litigants act with reference

to jurisdiction of the court and appointed them on that with
sworn evidence.
A

They cannot waive a jurisdiction requirement, your

Honor.
Q

Well, they can't waive the jurisdictional requirement
28

•1

but what evidence,, what are they going to pass on if not on

2

the allegation in the pleadings?

3

determine jurisdiction, allegations in the pleadings.

That is usually the way you

4

A

Well, 1 think the allegations were defective, your

5

Honor.

6

Q

For failing to allege what?

7

A

Facts to support the conclusions from which the Court

3

could draw the conclusions that the warden in performing these

3

acts if he did perform them, was acting under the color of

10

his office.

11

Q

That is really the sole issue?

12

A

That is as I see it your Honor, yes.

And the question of jurisdiction was raised by the Court
of Appeals.
Q

And once you decide that the case is over?

A

Yes, your Honor, I would submit to the Court that it

can approve the judgment of the Court of Appeals without
approving its reasoning, and it would be a rather simple
thing.
Q

But once you proved that the warden did this outside

of the scope of his authority, you recover against the warden
and everybody else.
A

What is left in the case?

No, as the Court has said, this Court said in the

Symes case, this is not a question of guilt or innocence.

I would think under the holding in Colorado versus

Symes that it would not be true* your Honor.
Q

Well, how could you find out when he was acting

was outside the color of authority.

fact in Maryland verus Soper, the warden held the removantdoes
not have to be for precisely the acts with which he is charged,
if he shows that these acts were in some way — he doesn't have
to admit the homicide — in order to show that at the time -Q

All he has to show is that he beat him up.

He doesn't have to show the homicide.
A

All he has to do is show that in his relations with

this prisoner he was always acting -Q

Well, wouldn't there be some substance to the fact

that Leavenworth is a maximum security prison and the respondent
was in that prison,

so whatever the warden is charged with

doing was done in the prison, unless he escaped.
30

1

A

Mo, it happened in the prison,, whatever happened.

2

Q

And then wouldn't the normal reaction be that it

3
4
5

6

was under the color of his office?
A

1 should assume that would be a rather easy thing to

do, to establish, but not the slightest effort was made.
Q

Well, 1 can submit that the fact that he says that

7

the only time I came in contact with this man was inside the

prison when I was the war-den.

A

That does not give you any idea

It might be under color of his office, but it doesn't

establish it.
Q

Well, what else would he have to say other than under

olor of authority?

What else could he say, the warden?

I beat

the man up?
A

No, that does not have to be said.

Q

Well, what could he say?

A

He must be able as this Court said, to show they were

not connected with unofficial activities.
Q

Well, suppose he said just that.

A

No, there must be facts.

Q

What are the facts?

A

Would that be enough?

That is what I find hard to understand from the opinion

of this Court in Maryland versus Soper, because the petition
there was so detailed in its allegations of facts that I don’t
know quite what else they could have alleged.
31

1

Q

Well, wouldn't that be true in this?

2

A

I suppose a good deal depends upon the allegations

3

in the original complaint as to what he would have to say.

4

ioes not have to admit that he did the act, but he does have

5

to show that if they were committed, they were committed in some

6

way, they had some causal connection with his official duties.
He was not off on a frolic of his own.

7
8

at the time.

9

this.

10

Q

He

Or that he was wardeh

The interrogatories raised some question as to

Don't you think that is what he tried to do in para­

11

graph 8 of the petition for removal on page 9 of the Appendix,

12

where he says, before that, he has alleged that he was the

13

warden;in paragraph 8 he says that anything that was done or

14

nay have been done was done under color of office and as an

15

employee, et cetera?

16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

And that the acts complained of was made solely under color
of office and with the scope of their authority.

But there is

a general allegation and then the question is whether in fact
the burden of going, it seems to me, maybe the question is
whether the burden of going forward with particularized alle­
gation, much more particularized than in the complaint uwhich
as you said earlier is pretty general, too, whether that burden
then shifted to the plaintiff.
Perhaps I am not saying that 1 am sure that is correct,
but that is one possibility.
32

1

A

My caminent on that, your Honor, would be that para­

2

graph 8 for the most part is conclusionary in nature and I

3

would think the burden of going forward with the proof does

4

not shift until there has been some proof,,

5

Q

What you are really saying is raising is a question

S

as to whether paragraph 8 is sufficiently particular as to

7

shift the burden of going forward and I suppose that the

8

question would naturally arise as to whether you can expect more

3

than that at this stage of the case and whether that is adequate

10

as a matter of law?

It

A

Yes, your Honor.

12

Q

One of these defendants was a physician, was he not?

13

A

Yes, your Honor.

14

Q

And the record shows that he had been assigned there

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

to do services as a physician, does it not?
A

Yes, your Honor.

Q

And the complaint is based on a charge that the

physician forced him with the aid of the other man to take
some kind of shot in his arm or leg or somewhere and it did
him great harm.
Now why doesn't that show about as well as you can show it
that the man was, they were both in the performance of their
duties because as a physician he wanted him to have that
medicine.

Do they have to go on and prove beyond a shadow of

ia doubt?
33

1

A

No, your Honor, I think it was

2

Q

And everybody agrees to it that that was alleged-

O

A

It would be very simple to submit an ordinary medical

4

record showing that this was the ordinary medical treatment

5

and this negates then any possibility,

6

Q

Well, he doesn't allege it was an ordinary one; he

7

just alleges that they did that, gave him this serum, and he

3

thought it might kill him.

9

A

He alleges they did this on a frolic of their own.

10

Q

He doesn't say that?

A

Yes, in the complaint, your Honor.

Q

What?

A

In his complaint.

Q

What part?

A

I may be wrong on that, your Honor.

11
12
13
14

15
16
17

13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

It may be in the

motion for remand to the State Court.
Q

As I gather, what he alleges is they were treating him

with a serum, the doctor, and the other man was helping him to
give it to him and he then fell to the floor.
A
Honor.

Well, I would propose a hypothetical question, your
Suppose — do the facts which are given by the petitionei s

in their removal petitions and their subsequent affidavits, do
they negate or do they give any facts that negate the idea that
the doctor may have been engaged in some kind of a strange
research.
34

1

Q

Well, that is a possibility, of course.

But when you

2

file pleadings, both sides going to submit it to the court on

3

removal, on pleadings, I don't see where you have to go any

4

further than the pleadings.

5

A

Because this court so held in Maryland versus Soper,

6

your Honor.

7

Q

In what?

8

A

Maryland versus Soper, that the allegations had to be
/

9

sufficient to show that not only were they at the time per­

*0

forming their actual duties, but they weren't performing any

11

other acts which were not related to their official dutues.

12

That was the holding of this court in Maryland versus

13

Soper, that they were not doing other things besides official

14

duties at the time.

15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

But you look at the whole record.

Does that say that

you don't look at the whole record where the parties submitted
on the pleadings and that is all they submitted on?

Does that

case stand for the principle that a judge is barred from taking
the parties at their word and looking at the pleadings as to
what has happened?

And he has to somehow force them to come

in and swear in addition to the pleadings?
A

They should allege some fact.

Q

That is right.

But it does allege it.

If it does

allege it, why isn't that enough if it is not denied?
A

The only answer I would have to that, your Honor, is
35

1

that we are dealing with a jurisdictional matter.

That is all.

\

2

Q

But why would the jurisdiction make such a difference.

O

That is a strong word.

4

But the mere fact that you are testing a jurisdiction, I thought

3

you always tested it mainly by the pleadings, what it alleged,

S

not what can be proven.

7

A

It means many things at many places.

Well, perhaps the distinction should be drawn between

3

the case which is removed under 1441 where the pleadings them­

9

selves must establish that the District Court would have

10

original jurisdiction and 1442(a), where the sole jurisdiction

11

of the Federal Court is derivative, no cause of action is

12

created by 1442.

13
14
15
16
17
18

The cause of action must already exist.

I point out in this court in Wheeler, Wheeldin versus
Wheeler, if the facts which are necessary for removal need not
be contained in the petition, in one case, Logemann versus Stock,
it was held in effect the petition removal was satisfied by
the — or cured by the fact that the necessary jurisdiction
facts were contained in the attached complaint.

Q

Do you know of any State in the Union that it is not

sufficient to file a complaint without swearing to it and you
judge whether or not the court has jurisdiction by what is
alleged?
A

That is true, your Honor.

I see my time has expired.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS X. BEYTAGH, JR., ESQ.

2

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
Mr. Beytagh.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court.

5

Just several points.

6

I think Mr. Justice Marshall put his finger on the real

|

7

problem here.

8

This is the basic position of petitioners that they didn't do

9

anything to harm this man.

10

Let us assume that none of these acts occurred.

What else can they do?

They denied it, they said that any contact that they had
-

11

with him was within the prison walls and they said they were

12

acting within their official duties.

13

And they said that they were acting within their official

14

duties and they said they were the warden and the chief medical

15

officer.

16

Now respondent keeps saying we need more facts.

17

that if there are no more facts to refer to, I don't know

18

short of what Mr. Justice Marshall suggested that they must

19

admit that they did something wrong or all they can do.

Q

I submit

Are you relying on the allegations of the papers as

being the facts as far as this trial is concerned?

Or do you

think he is right in indicating, as I gather is an indication,
that you had to have some sworn to?
A

No, your Honor, I agree with you on that.

how you can take any other position.
37

I don't see

It seems to me the District

1

Court had before it controverted allegations„

2

circumstances and it had to seek to apply the statute against

3

that and it seems to me in the circumstances there wasn't

4

anything else that it could do.

5

The reliance on ---

6

Q

Well, it isn't

It had factual

quite as easy as that, is it, Mr.

7

Beytagh, because the complaint contains a lot of very specific

8

allegations, and I suppose that they could have said that he

9

was never inoculated or if he was inoculated the prison records

10

show that such and such were the facts and that he was never

11

given any unusually onerous task to perform and his prison

12

records show so and so, so there could have been specificity

13

of the question.

It seems to me it is maybe who has the burden of going
forward for purposes of this removal -A

I think that is correct.

But it seems to me that any

of that would have been subject to the same claim that it was
conclusionary in nature and, therefore, inadequate, and it
seems to us that the District Court had an adequate basis here
and that Section 1446 on which respondent now relies is men­
tioned by the Court of Appeals only in ore sense it said that all|
the requirements thereof were met.
So, in conclusion we submit that the Soper and Symes cases
as Justice Stewart pointed out were criminal cases and there
at least everybody agreed something had occurred.

And, therefore»

1

we don't think they are controlling here.

2

Court of Appeals was wrong and we submit its judgment be

r.

In our view the

reversed.
Q

Mr. Beytagh, I take it though, you say that the

removal test is narrower than the course of employment?
A
notion.
Q

I think course of employment is a

somewhat different

I think that there is -No, it is just narrower.

The fact that the event

occurred while he was working with an employer isn't enough to
show removal?
A

I think it may not be enough, but again you have the

11
12

notion of color of office which has been given a broad reading
and that is what the statute said.

13
14

Thank you.
A VOICE:

May the Respondent have three minutes?

15

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Just one moment.

13

Mr. Snee is representing the petitioner in this case, and
17

Professor, just a moment.
18

Professor Snee, on behalf of the Court, I want to express
19

our appreciation to you for having accepted the assignment to
20

represent this indigent defendant.

We consider it a real public

21

service when lawyers are willing to undertake the assignments
22

of this kind and it is^ of a great help to the Court in the
23

resolution of these cases.
24

So we do thank you for your very generous and very ardent
25

We will go to the next case at this point.
