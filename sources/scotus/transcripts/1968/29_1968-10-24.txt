ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN CHRISTOPHER

Counsel are present.

from the Southern District of New York.

The Court below dis­

10

missed the Government's complaint, which had charged that the

is

defendant's activity violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

12

issue presented here is whether or not the antitrust exemption

13

of the Webb-Pomerene Act extends to the procurement of goods und( r

14

the United States Foreign Aid Program where the goods are shippec

15

abroad and where the funds to pay for the goods come from the

36

United States Treasury.
The facts are all stipulated here and they are not in

The

dispute.
The defendants below "appellees" here are five major
United States Corporations which produce concentrated phosphate
and the export association which they formed in 1961, which is
called the Concentrated Phosphate Export Association.

This asso

elation was organized in order to enable its members to act
jointly in the overseas sales of phosphate which is used in the
production of plant food or fertilizer,
-

The Concentrated Phosphate Export Association, Inc. is
registered with the Federal Trade Commission under the Webb-

13! Poraerene Act.

The board of directors of this association deter­

mines the prices at which the corporate members of the associatio

4
j S'

will sell their phosphate to the association and it determines

j0

the prices at which the association will sell the phosphate to

■ 7

others.

! 8

10

In addition, the board of directors of the association
also allocates the available business among the members of the
i

association.
Transactions here in issue involved some $43 million ir

11
12

sales to the Republic of Korea by the export association.

These

13

sales were all made pursuant to our United States Foreign Aid

14

Program, indeed, under this program the United States through All

15

the Agency for International Development, has been making grants

16

to Korea since 1953.
Two basic methods of procurement are involved in this

17
18

case.

IS

involving some $8 million, the procurement was handled by the

£0

United States General Services Administration.

21

GSA issued a standard invitation to bid, accepted the low bid on

22

behalf of the United States, paid the association, took the

23

delivery of the phosphate, and arranged for its shipment to

24

Korea.

25

In two of the transactions which are before the Court,

In that situation

In nine other transactions before the Court involving
-

4

-

some $35 million, AID authorized the Office of Supply to the
Republic of Korea to handle the procurement of the phosphate.
Each phase of this transaction, however, was rigidly controlled
by AID.

In these transactions the Phosphate Association was

paid by the United States bank, which in turn received its funds j
from the United States Treasury,

Whichever method of procurement

was followed, either through GSA or through the Office of Supply 1
of the Republic of Korea, AID supervised every aspect of the
transaction until final delivery.
The AID retained the right to divert the shipment.
As indicated above in my comments, in both cases the
funds for the phosphate came from the United States Treasury.
The Court below said AID initiated, controlled and directed and
financed the transactions involved.
Q

Mr, Christopher, I may have missed this.

When you

were talking about the transactions, when it was GSA made the
procurement directly, did you say GSA took delivery?
A

Yes, and then transshipped to Korea.

Q

What is the basis of that statement?

Q

GSA didn't take

Just what happened, there?

GSA did take -Excuse me for interrupting you, but I was troubled by

the brief at this point in this case and that may have an .important
bearing on it.
i

A

My understanding of the transaction, Mr. Justice Forta.^,

1

is that the goods, the phosphate in each case was shipped from

2

Florida to Korea, but in the GSA transaction GSA actually took

3

legal control of the goods before they were shipped out from the

4

country,

5

On the other hand, the Government makes no distinction

6

between the two types of transactions.

7

there is a legal differenc e between the two types of transactior

11

Q

We do not argue that

You place no emphasis upon the possibility that if

GSA did take delivery on those two transactions, there may be a
difference in terms of this case?
A

Mr. Justice Fortas, we think the crucial matter hare

12

is the funds came from the U. S. Treasury and the transaction was

13

controlled in every respect by AID.

14

legal steps in procurement differ significantly to make a legal

IS

difference between the GSA procurement and the Republic of Korea

procurement.

17

Q

We do not think that the

Do you contend in the two cases that the GSA took

delivery?

the contract was completely before them, within the United States; p

In other words, insofar as the bids are concerned,

20

A

Yes, sir, and I believe the situation bears that out.

21

Q

With respect to the; other transactions the delivery

22

was not affected until the phosphate arrived in the Republic of

Korea, is that right?

With respect to the other transactions, the Republic

of Korea sought the bids in Korea, the bids were made there and

Korea is under no obligation to repay the funds expended in these

procurements.

18

In 1964 the United States filed a complaint in the

19

Southern District of New York, charging that the activities of

20

this association constituted illegal px'ice-fixing and an allocation

21

of business in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

22

Court below dismissed the complaint, holding that the transactions

23

were within the Webb-Pomerene exemption.

25

The

!

In the view of the Court below because the goods were
shipped to a foreign country, the District Court thought they
-

7

-

constituted export trade within the meaning of the act.

However J

the District Court noted in its opinion that "It seems obviously j
cJ

unfair to the United States to permit the defendants to charge

4

an artificially set price and to deprive the United States of the

5

benefits which might come from price competition between the

S

association."
Notwithstanding that statement, the District Court

3

felt that the exports here were within the exemption of the

9

Webb“Pomerene Act and therefore held that the Government's com­

10

plaint must be dismissed,,

11

Q

12

Is there any contention here that there was not compe­

tition between the association and other bidders?

13

A

Mr. Justice White, there was competition between the

14

association and other foreign bidders and other bidders from the

15

United States.

m

Q

There were foreign bidders in this picture all the

time?
The extent of then

19

can be indicated from the fact that they made less than 16 percer fc

20

of the bids and got less than 18 percent of the business.

But

under our theory of the case, the presence of foreign competition

22

.

even to that limited degree, does not change what we regard as

23

the proper result and that is where the United States pays the

24

bill and where AID supervises the transaction, the Webb-Pomerene

25

exemption should not apply.

Q

This doesn’t make any difference, the fact that one

of the purposes of the act was to permit Americans to compete
successfully with foreign bidders, that purpose is present here
but nevertheless you think it should be limited when the U. S.
pays the bill?
A

That is correct.

Q

Even though the purpose of the act would be satisfied,

you would think the purpose was affected, it having to bid lower
than foreign bids?
A

The purpose of the act was to enable the American

exporters to compete in foreign markets for what I would call
traditional foreign business, where the foreign source pays the
money.

Now the framers of the act were very careful to make sure

that there would be no injury to the American taxpayer, and I
think it is that legislative purpose which illuminates the act
and which makes it clear here that where Uncle Sam pays the bill
and AID supervises the transaction, that the exception does not
apply.

Act, we must look at the underlying reasons.

I think our obligation is

to look to history and the purpose of Congress.

As just indi­

in this act to give the American exporters a better chance to
compete against foreign monopolies, especially foreign buying

cartels.

The philosophy of the act was that U. S. businesses
should be freed of antitrust restraints in their approach to for­

Reflecting that chauvinism, this act authorized joint

activity in circumstances where the resulting noncompetitive

20

price would be borne by a foreign country or by the people of a

foreign country, but the act and its legislative history make it

22

clear, as we read it, that this joint activity was to be permitted

23

only so long as there would be no adverse effect upon the American

24

economy, only so long as the American people would not be punishejd

25

The whole purpose of the act points out, we think, an

; exclusion of those transactions whereas here the anticompetitive

2

conduct, the joint activity that might be involved would be at

3

the expense of the American taxpayer.

4

Congress was trying to strengthen the hand of the

5

American exporter, too, to be sure*., as Mr. Justice White said.

6

But the export trade within the contemplation of the act, in our

7

view, was the traditional export trade between American and for­

0

eign countries, American bids trying to get business in foreign

countries that would be paid for by foreign sources or by foreigi

governments.

We think that this rule requires that the Webb-Pomerene

Act be confined to its underlying purpose and not give them the

18

expansive construction argued for here by the appellees, which

19

j

i

would invblve, as we see it, a potential burden on the American

20

taxpayer.

We think also that the history of Government procure- •

ment points in the same direction.

In all Government procurement it has been a strong

policy of Congress that there should be no interference with

Not only that, hasn't AID itself been active in suggest

23

A

Yes, that is correct, Mr. Justice White.

24

Q

And encouraging their formation?

25

A

As to that, I would only say that procurement officiali
12

-

'

do not act as the final arbiters of the antitrust laws.

They do

not control the United States antitrust policy and frequently
they tax actions which in the long run turn out to be in viola­
tion of antitrust laws.

Indeed, the only other time that this

Court, I think, has written an opinbn on the Webb-Pomeren area
was in the Alkali Exports Association Case in 325 U.S.
This Court made it clear that it was the responsibility
of the Department of Justice to invoke the Sherman Act on WebbPomerene associations when the circumstances were appropriate.
It is perfectly clear, I think, under all the precedents that
the officials at AID had no power to weigh or suspend the provi­
sions of the Sherman Act, no matter what they might have done to
encourage the formation of the Webb-Pomarene associations or
their bidding on these contracts.
Neither does it seem to me to be persuasive here that
in the course of the legislative history there are indications
that Congress was aware that there might be loans to foreign
governments during the World War I period when this act was
enacted or thereafter.

The crucial difference is that the loans

referred to in that portion of the legislative history were repay
able and the burden of noncompetitive conduct, the burden of
joint activity, would fall on the foreign governments or their
citizens whereas in the case of the United States grants, which
has been the familiar pattern under AID, the burden of noncom­
petitive conduct falls on the American taxpayer.
13

-

-

1t

It is our position here that the framers of the act,
although they wanted to encourage export trade and wanted to

3

encourage, small businesses in the United States to get together
to compete in foreign markets, they ware equally clear that this

5 Jwas not to be in any respect at the expense of the American tax-

6 : payer.
Now when you take five companies as large as these

a

companies are, I think one might not unnaturally think that if

8

*

they were competing against each other in this or comparable situa­

9
10

tions, that a lower price might be achieved.

As I say, history

31

and this transaction does not tell us that, but the whole premise!

12

of our antitrust laws is that competition will produce lower

33

prices and its those lower prices than that competition which

34

I believe the framers of the act would have wanted to preserve
;

15

for the American taxpayer in those instances where there is

36

Federal Government procurement.

There

X.

23

might be two possible grounds on which mootness could be sug­

24

gested, neither of them persuasive, I believe, sir.

25

First, the Webb--Pome rene association here has been

14

-

-

1

dissolved, but it's a familiar rule of this Court that the right

2

to antitrust relief cannot be undercut by the dissolution of an

3

association or a corporation during the course of litigation, to

4

go back 1 think to the Freight Association Case in 166 U.S.

!
*«"

3

The second problem on which mootness might be suggestec.

6

was chat on January 1, 1967, the AID officials adopted the regu­

7

lation forbidding Webb-Pomerene bidding or bidding by Webb-Pomerene

0

associations in those instances where there is procurement in

§

United. States sources only.

10

Now that is a limited type regulation.

It would not,

11

in turn, affect this case.

12

Fortas, it seems to us that the fact that AID could change that

13

regulation, modified, and go back to its own rules, makes it

14

clear that this case is not moote and underscores the need for a

15

determination here.

16

Even if it did though, Mr. Justice

We are seeking a statutory determination of what we

17

regard as a very important underlying question.

ciliation of two important statutes, the Webb-Pomerene Act and

19

the Sherman Act.

20

the importance of it has not been diminished by anything that has

transpired and for the reasons I have given, I believe the case

22

is not technically moot.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL W. MURPHY
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please:

I think we would differ a bit with the Deputy Attorney
General in studying the question presented on this appeal.

We

would state the question as being whether AID-financed export
sales made in competition with foreign producers is export trade
as those words are used in the Webb Act.
It seems to us of considerable importance on the stipu­
lated facts of this record, important both in terms of the
general significance of the case to the propositions the Govern­
ment is putting forward and important in terms of the outcome of
the case, that there was active foreign competition here in each
of the transactions challenged by the Government, with one excep­
tion.

That one exception was a transaction on which the defen­

dants received no award of the business.
In the Webb--Pomerene Act in defining export trade,
Congress went to particular care to outline, first, what export
trade was to be covered by, the immunity of the Webb Act, defin­
ing it in terms of the export of goods from this country to
another.
not.

It also defined export trade in terms of what it is

It is not production, it is not manufacture, and it is not

sale within the United States for resale or consumption here.
In addition, Congress attached a series of provisos in
which it was stated that even though an act might be within
-

16

-

1

export trade, as literally defined, you would nevertheless be

2

subject to the Sherman Act prohibitions if it resulted, in any

3

event, artificial or intentional effect on the prices in the

4

United States, any restraint of the export trade of domestic

S

competitors in the association, or any restrain of trade in the

6

United States „
This is stipulated in the record*

7

It is stipulated

8

here that the goods sold by the defendants were exported from

9

this country not only to Korea, but to 38 other countries»

It

10

is stipulated that the defendants met all of the requirements

11

of the Webb-Pomerene Act and it is conceded that they did not

12

violate any of its provisos.
Consequently, that being so, it seems to us that the

13
14

ultimate question presented to this Court by this appeal is whetl er

15

the transactions challenged by the Government were so radically

16

different from anything that Congress might have had in mind in

17

1918 as to justify or require a departure from the otherwise

18

pretty plain English of that law.

19

Q

If the sale in question were a sale to the United States

20

and paid for by the United States and the merchandise were shipped

21

by the United States, out of this country, would the transaction

22

have the benefit of a Sherman Act exemption, an antitrust exemp­

23

tion?

24
25

A

I think in a practical sense, Justice Fortas, that

would depend on other facts not in your question.
-

17

-

Our position

as a general proposition, the test of whether the Webb Act
applies is the ultimate and intended destination of the goods.
But X would believe that in a case where the sale were to the
United States and for use by the United States someplace else,
i

|that one of the provisos attached by the act might well come
Iinto play as dependent on the fact of the situation.
Q

j

You mean that transaction might not be entitled to the

present exemption?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

Suppose with the same facts X indicated before and the

United States, instead of sending if abroad for use by the United
States, sent it etbroad for use by another country?
A

I think that transaction, given only those facts, would

be entitled to the exemptions by the test which Congress has laid
down.
Q
perhaps:

So that what you are relying on here are two facts,
One that with the possible exception of the two trans-

I

actions, purchases were made by an agency of the Republic of
f

Korea, and, two, that although the merchandise was turned over
to the Republic of Korea, it was intended for resale.

Are those

the two points on which you rely on to distinguish this from
the last case I put to you?
A

We also rely very heavily, Mr. Justice Fortas, on the

presence of foreign competition.

There is just no question

that the Webb-Pomerene Act was designed basically to encourage
-

18

-

i

1

American companies to participate more extensively in export
trade by allowing them to cooperate, not only for the purposes
suggested by the Government, but also for the purposes of reducing

4 [costs and mustering greater resources.

5
G

Q

Would you agree that, in a theoretical manner, if the

[

procurement were by the United States for use by the United States
abroad, the fact that chere ttfould be foreign competition would

0 [not put the transaction under the antitrust exemption umbrella
D
10
Vi

12

of the Webb-Pomerene Act?
A

No, I don’t believe 1 would agree with that, Justice

Fortas.
Q

You think that if there is foreign competition, that

13

fact standing alone, added to the export of the goods, of course,

14

makes it a Webb-Pomerene transaction for the purposes of anti­

15

trust?

16

A

I would not agree that fact standing alone would deterr xnt

17

it, but it seems to me one of the most significant facts.

i;

case, as I understand it, the Government's position comes down

ID

solely to the proposition that there was injury to the United

20

States and an injury which they presume, as I understand their

21

case, from applying to the sales of this Webb-Pomerene associa­

22

tion Sherman Act principles which Congress has said are not to aj

23

so long as that association is engaged in export trade.

24
25

In oui

That seems to us a peculiar avenue along which to
approach the question of whether this was export trade.
-

19

-

A reason

pi!

Ii
I

jwhy we emphasize foreign competition here, even if you start dowr
jfchat avenue it is our further position that you find no injury,

j

no injury in fact.
Now Hr. Christopher has emphasized m his argument, and ;
the Government has in its brief, the point that the Republic of

:

Korea bought concentrated phosphates in these particular transactions using grant funds and that therefore there was a burden
on the United States.
1 suggest the burden is far greater where a foreign
competitor wins an award of that business, because that foreign
competitor was just as eligible as were these defendants to win
in AID dollars and every AID dollar paid to a supplier from •'
Tunisia on account of his sale to the Republic of Korea was a
dollar that was gone from the United States, whereas every dollar
that these defendants obtained in this Korean market, as was
true with the dollars it obtained in selling in 38 other markets,
was a dollar kept in the United States.
To that extent on the facts of this case it seemed to
me if there is a fiscal burden of any kind, we helped to reduce
it.
Q

I gathered from Mr. Christopher's statement that -- whet

percentage did he say of his trade had been obtained by foreigners
A

I believe he used the figure of about 16 percent.

Q

Of the trade of the AID business or of the trade with

Korea or what?

A

I was not clear.

There were 13 transactions with

Q

I understand that.

Two of which are not challenged in this case.

Q

Which are involved in this case, would it be 16 percent

of these transactions?

Which are involved in this?

None of these transactions?

Absolutely.

AFTERNOON SESSION
12:30 p.m.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Murphy, you may con­

tinue your argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL W. MURPHY (resumed)
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, if the court please

[ should like to return briefly to two questions asked just
before recess.
Mr. Justice Fortas asked a question of whether
delivery was made on the two transactions in which GSA par­
ticipated.
According to the agreement, Justice Fortas, between
GSA and AID and the pertinent parties printed on page 288 of
the Appendix, delivery was to be made to AID or to its destin­
ation, which in this case was the Republic of Korea.

The papers

on one of those transactions, which are printed in the Appendix
beginning at page 293s show that in that transaction delivery
of the commodities x^as made to a vessel in a Florida port con­
signed to the Republic of Korea.
As to the questions of Justice White about the
success of foreign producers on these transactions, \»rhlch I
am not sure I answered too clearly, of the 11 Korean procure­
ments financed by the Agency for International Development,
foreign producers won 18 percent of the total amount of business

22

awarded on all 11 transactions,
Q,

How do two people participate in the same transaction?

A.

Korea invited tenders on and awarded very substantial

tonnages.

A particular bidder would also make a variety of bids

depending on delivery time, different prices for different
quantities, different delivery periods, and in many of these
transactions the awards iuare split - - so much to these
defendants, so much to another American supplier, so much to
a foreign producer.
Q

Do you think in these 11 transactions they were

really bidding head to head?
A.

No question about that.

Now before getting back into

the facts, which at least as we view them show that these were
not totally different transactions from what Congress contem­
plated, I would also like to note in passing that Congress
which enacted the Webb Palmerine Act in 1918 was itself very
busy in foreign aid.
It was during that period that Congress was
authorizing and appropriating very considerable sums of money
for foreign assistance programs, so that certainly Congress
had within its general contemplations, in adopting the Webb Act5
that export trade associations would trade in foreign markets
that were supported, by the credit of the United States.
That recognition was expressed during the debates
prior to the passage of the act, and at the end of World War 1
23

and immediately thereafter export trade associations did sell
at that time to European customers, who were totally dependent

\

on the financial assistance of the United States.
Export Trade Associations have continued to make
those sales from time to time during the fifty years since the

j

Act was passed, during war time and post war periods, and in the
Lend-Lease programs stipulated, and in various of the modern
foreign aid programs.
During that same period Congress has regularly re­
viewed the foreign assistance programs and has frequently
I reviewed the Webb Act, and has never at any time suggested that
it intended in any way, In adopting the modern foreign
assistance programs, to role back the Webb Act as the government
now asks.
Mr. Christopher referred to a sentence in Judge Ryan's
■ opinion below which does seem to me a good way to get into a
more detailed discussion of some of the facts here.
page 362 of the joint Appendix.

I refer to

Judge Ryan say3, "It seems

obviously unfair to the United States" in describing the
situations in which Webb Associations sell to foreign aid
finance customers.
It is quite clear to us that Judge Ryan in that sen­
tence was describing the government's argument.
in is the core of the government's argument.

He says, "Here- i

We cannot say that i

it does not have appeal", and then follows the sentence that
24

!

Mr. Christopher referred to.
Judge Ryan then goes on in the balance of his opinion

2
3

to set forth his conclusions as to why the government's position,,

4

why the superficial appeal of unfairness in the government’s

5

position is simply not so, as a matter of fact.
In this particular case we rely quite heavily on the

6

-

7

aspect of foreign competition as meeting any suggestions of

a

unfairness, as well as two other aspects of the case.
First, the full disclosure to, and yet encouragement

9
10

by officials of both the Korean and the United States govern­

11

ments of the defendant’s participation in AXD-financed

12

business, and secondly, the stipulated facts which as we view

13

them quite clearly demonstrate that there was no injury here to

14

the United States as a matter of fact.
These defendants and their associations registered

16

although Korea was the single most important consumer or pur]

chaser of this association’s products.
At all time it is stipulated, AID, GSA and the Office
of Supply of the Republic of Korea knew what the defendants

25

j
j

!

were, knew how they did business, and at all times all of our

2

bids to Korea were made in response to formal investigations in

3

competitive public bidding procedures.

4

We do not suggest that those facts give rise to any

5

kind of an anti-trust immunity.

We do not suggest that AID’S

-S

regulations and activities take the place of either the Webb

7

Act on the one hand or the Sherman Act on the other.

a

But they are facts which do seem to us to be quite

9

significant as they relate to the thread running through the

60

I ft
12
13

government’s cases suggesting unfairness on our part, and per­
haps even more importantly we believe that they are significant
to the question of injury.
Had AID officials believed that their program was

14

being in any way burdened by the activities of these defendants,

15

in any way injured or frustrated, as the government has

IS

suggested, I think it unreasonable to conclude that they would

17
18

ID
20
21

22

nevertheless have solicited bids from us, when AID did clearly
possess the authority which it exercised on January 1, 196? to
shut Webb Act associations out of AID-financed markets.
A second important fact is this fact of foreign com­
petition which already has been covered quite thoroughly.
That brings me to what I think is the quite clear fact

23

that there is just no evidence in this stipulated record that

24

there was any injury of any kind, that there was any burden of

25

any kind on the United States, any harm either to Korea or to

26

fche United States foreign aid program.

This is a stipulated

record.
During the hearing below before Judge Ryan, which
took the place of a full trial, he probed quite carefully into
this questions and in response to his question government
counsel conceded that there was no suggestion here by the
government that the defendants or their associations had in any
way over-charged either AID or Korea, or had engaged in any way
in any unfair or unreasonable or discriminatory prices.
There has never been any suggestion in this case of
any damage, any injury, any burden, any unfairness, as a matter
of fact.

The only injury which is said to flow here is from

applying to business activities which are exempt from the
Sherman Act, principles which would apply only if the exemp­
tions were lost.
Not only is there no injury but, if the court please,
we think the record is quite clear that the evidence relating
to that question is quite to the contrary.
Q

However that may be, I think the problem is one of

statutory construction and application here.

Sales to the

United States are not expressly outside of the coverage of the
anti-trust exemption under the Webb-Palmerine Act.

Do I under­

stand you to agree that they are outside of that exemption on
the basl3 of the doctrine that the sovereign is excluded unless
otherwise specifically provided?
27

A.

I had not thought of it on that basis. Justice Portas,

but I do agree that a sale to the United States for consumption
by the United States is not included.
Q,

So it seems to me that the question here is whether

the various functions performed by the United States in these
transactions convert this into,in effect, a sale to the United
States by the associations involved here.
If it is considered a sale to the United States there
may be some other questions which could be answered, but at
least to that extent you take it out of the Webb-Palmerine ex­
emption and I think you would say you would want to find out
what the United States does with it.

What is your answer to

that unfortunately compound question of mine?
A,

I would again say that I do not agree that a sale of

commodities to the United States, which commodities the United
States then gives away to a foreign consumer, Is outside the
Webb exemptions.

I think that is within the Webb exemption.

Q,

Why is that?

You mean within the Webb Act?

A

That Is right.

Q,

Not within the Webb exemption?

A

That is right.

That is export trade as the Webb Act

defines it.
Q,

So you think that the United States, sovereign United

States, is affected by the anti-trust exemptions in the WebbPalmerine Act, depending upon what the United States does with

j

the merchandise?
A

Quite frankly. Justice Portas, I am unable to answer

the sovereignty aspects of your question.

I do not think that

/

this is a position that we have to defend in this case.
Q

I am not sure that it is not.

What is the basis of

your statement that a sale to the United States for consumption
by the United States in some foreign country is not covered by
the anti-trust exemption?

What is the basis for that?

How do

you arrive at that?
A
Portas.

I must have misunderstood your question. Justice
My position would be and is that Congres set down a.

clear test in using the word "export" in the same sense that it
had become settled in the law by that date in the sense of its
ultimate resting place.
I believe that I responded to your similar question
before the recess, Justice Portas, by saying that in my view, on
the facts you pose, that is a government purchase for government
consumption abroad, that the provisos would come into play, and j
depending on the facts of the situation, it would be found that
there was a kind of effect on domestic commerce which the Webb
Act proscribes.
But in this case it has been stipulated that the
United States was not the purchaser.

On page 49 of the Appendix

in our stipulation it states that AID did not itself procure
any concentrated phosphates for Korea.

29

And the record is replet:

with the fact that
G,

Yes, I know, but (3SA is in the United States, too.

k

The government, as I understand it, attributes no

significance to the difference, and In our view GSA partici­
pation did not alter the substance of this transaction at all.
Novi Mr. Christopher has suggested that this is a very signifi­
cant case, in which the government needs a broad ruling.

This

brings one naturally to the question Justice Fortas also raised
this morning about mootness.

In the first instance we will

emphasize the narrowness of this case.
The stipulated record, the fact that relates to AIDflnanced, only to AID-financed markets, In which there is foreign
competition, the emphasis placed in the case by the government
on the fact that Korea used grant rather than loan aid, whereas
at the present time grants form a relatively small part of
total foreign aid.
Now, finally, whatever significance this narrow case
had was pretty well sucked out of it when, effective January 1,
1967, AID adopted a regulation which went directly to the
question of the extent to which Webb Associations can deal in
AID-financed markets, by providing that such associations would
not be eligible to bid unless foreign suppliers were also
eligible to bid.
The practical consequence of that regulation was to
put this association out of business.
30

The association ceased

all operations in June, 1967j has made no sale since then, and
the association was formally dissolved and entirely abandoned at
the end of last year.
The government’s case, it seems to us, comes down to
a policy argument that it Is somehow a bad thing to allow
export associations to sell to foreign customers being financed
by the United States government.

We suggest that that is an

argument better addressed to the Congress than to this court,
and in any event the narrow nature

and the dead nature of this

case will not support the weight of that kind of policy consideratlon, so that the judgment below should be affirmed.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
MR. CHRISTOPHER:

Mr. Attorney General.

May it please the court, I wish to

make only three brief points in concluding.
First, the government believes that the presence or
absence of foreign competition is not the determinative factor
on this issue of statutory construction.

The foreign competi­

tion which was present here was only that competition which was
permitted by AID.
As paragraph 23 of the record indicates, page H9 of
the stipulation, the only foreign companies chat were able to
participate in the bidding were those in countries which were
authorized to bid under the AID regulations.
Basically, AID permitted companies in the under31

developed countries and the less developed countries to bid on
this procurement.

1 think this demonstrates very well how

irrelevant the presence or absence of foreign competition is
t

to the determination of this statutory issue.
AID could tomorrow ban all foreign competition, and
has frequently done so in connection with its procurement, or
its supporting of foreign countries«procurement.

In a situation

where American companies had a monopoly there would be no foreign
competition at all and yet the statutory question would remain
the same.
So I think we would say that the procurement agencj7
determines the extent of the foreign competition.

The procure­

ment agency is able to determine whether or not It wishes on a
given procurement to permit foreign companies to participate in
the bidding and thus to have some of our dollars go abroad.
To reflect on Mr. Murphy’s concern, and that fact,
the extent to which the procurement agency permits foreign
competition, should not and cannot be controlling on the matter
of* statutory construction involved here.
Second:

while we do not contend that there was any

firaud on the part of the defendant appellee, at the same time
we would not agree that there has been no conceivable injury to
the government in this case.
The record shows that each of the defendant corpora­
tions which formed this association Is a company of more than a
32

hundred million dollars in assets.

One of them has four and a

half billion dollars in assets.
To suggest that if they were bidding against each
other the result would not have been different is, 1 think, to
fail to look at the realities which lie behind the Sherman Act.
Four of the five companies that make up this export
association are in the top five in this industry.

All five are

in the top ten, and I think when you look at those facts you
have to recognize that if the bidding had been fully competitive
if the American taxpayer had had the advantage of having
American companies bidding against each other, you might have
had a different result.
So I say, while we do not charge any fraud on the
part of the defendant companies - we think this is a very pure
question of statutory interpretation and an important one nevertheless, the premise of the anti-trust laws, I think, is
effective here to indicate that there should be bidding and
full competition where government procurement dollars are
jinvolved.
And finally, I would like to go back to Mr. Justice
Fortas* questions and the points he has been making, because I
believe they illuminate the fact that the form of this trans­
action should not be controlling here.

Rather what should be

controlling is that this is government procurement.

These are

United States tax dollars and they ought to be spent under

33

J

circumstances where the American taxpayer has full benefits of

2

competition.

L

8

What is the basis for excluding the sales to the

The Webb-Palmerine Act, Mr. Justice Portas, provides

an exemption for activities done in the course of export trade.
It is the government's contention that when Congress

0
JO

used those terms it was referring to traditional export trade

11

where American businesses sold in foreign countries to foreign

12

purchasers who paid from foreign funds.
Now,

13

think that the legislative history makes it

14

clear that Congress did not use those words in referring to

15

American procurement.
Q

16

In other words, you are not relying on any special

17

provision in the statute, but by implication derived from the

18

fact that the United States is sovereign in that doctrine and

19

in legislative history.
A.

20

Yes, Mr. Justice.

I believe it could be argued that

21

the proviso, taking out of the exclusion things that are in

22

restraint of trade within the United States might be effective

23

here because this conduct restrains trade in American procure­

24

ment .

25

But the government believes that the sounder articula-

34

tion of the argument Is that the history of the act and the
2

intention of Congress excluded government procurement from the

3

concept of export trade that they were trying to permit

4

companies to get together on.
