ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRIS T«2INSTEIN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. WEINSTEIN;

Counsel are present.

Mir. Chief Justice, may it please the

this is a labor ease which comes to the court from a

Court,

9

writ of certiorari of the United States Court of Appeals for

10

11

the Ninth Circuit.
The sole issue goes to scope of the remedial power of

12

the National Labor Relations Board.

13

Once the board has found an unfair refusal to execute a labor

14

contract, may it include in its order a provision that re­

15

quires the respondent to pay past fringe benefits that it

16

would have been required to pay if it had executed the con­

17

tract in timely fashion.

18

The exact issue is this;

The Court of Appeals said no, the board may not do this,

19

it may not direct payments required by a lack of agreement and

20

that the remedy is not a board order but must be by way of

21

suit under Section 301 of the act.

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Weinstein,

MR. WEINSTEIN:

Your Honor.

If the Court please,

you may

proceed.
Thank you,

mentioned that on three occasions,

the union asked that the respondent execute the contract and

8

he refused.

unfair labor practice charges and the board upheld them and

10

ruled that the respondent had not honored his duty as an em­

11

ployer .

in October 1963 and in 1964

On the basis of these facts, the union filed

Under this paragraph of the order, it is beyond the

The Court of Appeals analysis was, if I under­

stand it, that the unfair labor practice was not the failure

25

t© pay these amounts but was, instead,
7-

just a refusal to

!<

power of the board."

New, the Court of Appeals ruled that if an order of the

5

3

board directs payment of something required by a contract,

7

what else the circumstances, the board doesn't have power to

8

do that.

9

would be a suit against the employer, under Section 301 of the

10
11

The only recourse to the union or its membership

act.
Now, then, at the time we filed our brief here, I believe

12

there have been running cases on this or related matters, and

13

this was the only ore that found the board without power.

14

There since has been another case, I would like to call to the

15

Court's attention, in the Fourth Circuit.

Beverage what?

24

before the Board in this case.

2369

2

Q

2369?

3

A

Yes .

4

Q

Is that a board decision or is that a court decision

5

there?

6

A

7

That is a decision of the Fourth Circuit enforcing a

decision of the board.

8

Q

The Fourth Circuit?

9

A

The Fourth Circuit.

Part of the order that is to foe

10

enforced is essentially similar to paragraph 2(h) of the order

11

here.

12

13

Q

So presumably in due course that will be reported in

the Federal Supplement?

14

A

15

Now, in the final analysis, the resolution of this case

I would presume so.

16

depends upon the construction that is placed upon section 10(c)

17

of the act, that tells the board what to do once it finds an

18

unfair labor practice and is the source of the board's remedial

19

authority.

20

Now, since -- this tells the board to do two things.

21

First, to answer a cease and desist order which is here, and

22

then it tells the board to take such affirmative action, in­

23

cluding reinstatement of employees, with or without back pay,

24

as will effectuate the policies of this act.

25

Now, one of the line of cases, going back to the inception
-9-

1

of the Wagner Act, this Court has looked at this language and

2

it has considered what it allowed the board to do.

3

haps the roost recent summary of the authorities is in the

4

Fiberboard decision, 379 U.S,

5

the board is directed to take affirmative action, and that

S

action should be whatever is needed to restore things to what

7

they would have been without the unfair labor practice, and

8

that asserts two functions.

9

And per­

But the thrust of it is simple,

First, it restores the bargaining process.

It lets it

10

operate as it would have without the unfair activity.

Second,

11

it takes the profit out of this.

It takes away any hope of

12

gain through refusing to bargain.

It deters the particular

13

respondent and other people from illegal conduct and encourages

14

them to voluntarily perform their duties under the act.

15

Now, we would think that under this analysis,

there is an

16

extremely strong case for our position here without looking

17

further.

18

The board has an affirmative duty to provide relief, to

19

restore the status quo and to the violation.

20

other cases that have been reported in the Court of Appeals

21

on this subject show that basically that there are two patterns,

22

either as in this case the employer has refused to execute a

23

contract that has been negotiated by him or on his behalf.

24

And the board, among other things, sa^ to the employers, "Pay

25

whatever you would have had to pay if you executed the

Tie cases, the

i

1

contract in a timely fashion."

No, it is refusing to sign the contract.

Mr. Justice White ashed me if it was conceded here

And then how did this get back to the Court of

last January.

Appeals?
A

No,

our time for petitioner was not the same as the

21

respondent's because we had filed a petition for rehearing in

22

the Court of Appeals.

23

Q

Oh,

24

A

And our petition for certiorari was therefore not

25

due until,

I see.

I believe,

in April, and that is when we filed.
12-

Q

If he had signed the contract and then refused to

pay the fringe benefits and refused fc© talk about it, I suppose

3

it would be an unfair practice, too?

A

White.

6

Q

But here you say his refusal to sign the contract --

7

A

Yes, and what is the consequence of that?

That might depend upon the circumstances, Mr. Justice
For example, one ---

The other

8

line of cases I think fall in the category of just refusing to

3

pay after the contract i3 executed.

For example, in the Scam

1

case, which I think was in the Seventh Circuit, the employer

11

had unilaterally amended the health program and refused to

12

bargain with it.

13

program, a unilateral amendment without bargaining, was both a

14

violation of the contract and a refusal to bargain.

15

either instance, whether the case i3 like that one or this one,

16

the board has entered an order requiring that the employees be

17

made whole that what they have been deprived of.

18

in this case, while the payment, the mere refusal to pay the

19

fringe benefits might not have been an unfair labor practice

if the contract had been signed.

though, if it were an unfair practice to

refuse to pay, simply, it might make more -- the remedy

question might be easier and clearer?

10

I think the Court of Appeals analysis would fall

A

11

apart because they relied in part on the fact that that in it­

12

self on this record was an unfair practice that was found.

I think it is the implication of what they say.

I have a problem with that.

These are pretty weak but the inference the

3

of adjustment or prevention that has been established by agree­

4

ment,

5

of the act says that the board's power under the

law or otherwise.
And the interesting thing is that Congress doesn't seem

6

to give any thought that there was any possibility that it was

7

the best thing for the jurisdiction to act in a case like this.

8

It did express some concern that Section 301 could be limited

9

to situations where there was no unfair labor practice, and the

10

committee report recognised that possibility and expressly

11

says that when there are two remedies,

12

and one before the courts,

13

exclusive.

14

Now,

this Court also,

I would say, is not writing on a

slate.

manner preempted.

The next two cases, Smith vs. Evening News, 371 U.S.,

2

cases, but in each of the opinions the court took care to say

3

that it was not suggesting that the board was without juris­

4

diction and expressly said in each instance that there were

5

dual remedies available.

6

Now,

the issue was ?jofc before the court in those

The next two cases were companion cases,

in 385 U.S.,

the

7

C & C Plywood case and the Acme Industrial case, and in each

8

of those the contention was that the board was without juris­

9

diction in matters that could be adjudicated before the courts

10

11

in a 301 suit.

And in each instance this argument was rejected.

And then in the Great Dane case,

later in the same term,

12

a similar argument had been made in the Court of Appeals but

13

was dropped when this case reached this Court.

14

opinion again points out that the fact that there is jurisdic­

tion in the courts under 301 does not deprive the board's

jurisdiction.

17

But the Court’s

New, suppose that these cases could be distinguished from

18

the C & C and Plywood and Acme Industrial on the ground that

those cases involve the subject matter of the labor board?

suggest that this case is an easier one in finding the board’s

the problem was that there

Hera the disputed matters, at least
17-

-

t

as the contentions have been framed, are not things that are

2

ordinarily decided in the courts in Section 301 suits.

3

contract has been used simply as an instrument of the remedy.

4

It is just the same,

ordering back pay,

tract, as so many are today.
I suppose,

I would think,

The

that if the board, in

used an hourly rate established by the con­

analysis to its logical completion,

the board can no longer

order back pay because back pay is based on a rate established

in the contract.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

of fact to keep in mind.

First, Mr. Strong was bound by the industry contract as a

Under Wiley vs. Livingston,

been proper.

that an arbitrator was not a part of this contract.

In all due respect, given the labor board competence to

19

decide breaches of contract, the labor board, interestingly

20

enough, in several very recent cases, we submit respectfully,

2?

has demonstrated that it is not so competent.

22

In Adams Dairy -- these cases we have not cited in our

23

brief -- they are labor board cases -- but in a series of

24

labor board cases, commencing with Adams Dairy, including

25

C & S Industries, the labor board has said if a contract is
21-

-

1

silent about a particular provision, than the employers or the

2

union, whoever it may be, is not bound to arbitrate or the

3

board can interpret that meaning any way it wants»

4

in strict disagreement with the decisions of this Court in

5

the trilogy, that when a contract is silent on an arbitrator,

6

it might well imply that a restriction or a right, on the

7

conduct of the parties to do so.

8

That is

A leading case, the Moyer case in this court, was a sub­
contracting case.

Yet in Adams Dairy, the

10

that you shouldn't have to go to arbitration because the only

thing the arbitrator could do was interpret the contract under

Chief Justice.

5

Q

I know, it is bothering me.

6

A

The reason, first of all., goes to the fact if they

7

were discharged, they would have done so with anti-union ends.

8

I do think that there could be a distinction between the

9

employer acting on an anti-union --- and the employer acting

Yes, sir.

As I stated, an arbitrator can

look into production, prcductivity.

He can look into all sorts

10

of things that a board can't.

That is the purpose of the

11

trilogy and the purpose of it, was to permit an arbitrator in

12

the rules of common law, in the rules of the shop, and so

13

forth, to arrive at the decision of the court, where the labor

board would not arrive at it.

this is our whole argument here.
