District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.
In 1963 the United States filed a civil complaint
under Section I of the Sherman Act alleging that at least sinc<

corrugated containers in the Southeastern United States,
14

unlawfully combined to exchange among themselves information
15

as to prices they charged or quoted specific customers for the
16
purpose and with the effect of restricting price competition.
17

The case was submitted to the District Court for
18
decision on the basis of proposed findings, many of which were
IS
agreed to, as well as on the basis of extensive depositions
20
taken by the plaintiff of various officers of the defendant,
21

and of exhibits introduced by both parties.

22
The United States asserted the evidence as to the
23

defendant's course of conduct of the eight-year period compelle a

24

the conclusion that a combination existed whereby defendants

25

furnished to one another upon request, information as to the

2

most recent price or current quotes any member of the group
3
2

was offering to a specific customer.
The United States also asserted that, under the

3

facts of this case, such a combination was unlawful because it

4

had the purpose and necessary effect of restricting price

S

competition.

6

The District Court handed down its decision on

August 31, 1967,

9

the District Court concluded that no combination for the

It dismissed the Government's complaint with
In brief,

10

furnishing of specific price information was proven.

It further

11

found that even with such a combination, it was not unlawful

13

since there was no further agreement among the defendants to

13

use the exchange price information to maintain prices or

14

minimize price reductions.

15

We believe the District Court was wrong, as a matter

13

of law, in not finding that a combination existed, and that it

17

also applied an erroneous legal standard to the question of

18

the legality of the combination.

19

The agreed upon facts described the corrugated con-

business.

It is also the fact that the six largest defendants

account for almost 60 percent of the business.
The number of sellers interested in any given purchase
was also limited by such considerations as the geographic
proximity of the buyer to the seller8s plant, and the suita­
bility <?£ the seller's equipment, and the attractiveness of
the order, and the particular product mix then being manu­
factured.
The business is essentially a custom order one, with
each purchaser indicating the particular specifications of its
box requirements.

The buyers do not carry inventories, and

they must buy for immediate needs.
Price is the consideration which determines to whom
a buyer gives

its business, since there were no quality

differences among the products offered by the sellers.

A box

made to a particular specification is identical to any other
seller's box.

The industry throughout the period was charac-

terized by chronic over-capacity.
The ::ourt found that as to each defendant that when
it considered it necessary to ascertain from a defendant com­
petitor the most recent price to a specific customer or when
to ascertain the accuracy of a customer's report of another
competitor's price that information was usually requested from
the competitor then supplying the customer.
The court also found as to each defendant that when

4

\

1

such a request for information as to the most recent price to

2

a specific customer was received that information usually was

3

furnished and it was accurate»

4

After receipt of the information each company was

3

free to do with it what it wished although the findings again

In such cases, the defendants would neither give nor

Q

"off the air".

Mr.

Zimmerman, does the evidence show a uni­

formity of prices throughout the industry?
A

IS

No, it does, not, Mr. Justice Harlan, and I think

17

this would enable me to clarify what this case is not about,

18

because it is not about that.

.

For one thing, this case is not about an express

19

20

agreement.

21

persistent course of conduct.

22

It is about a combination which is revealed by a

Secondly, it is not about a claim of specific price

23

fixing, as for example the Government charged in the electrical

24

price conspiracy cases, where in submitting bids on custom-made

25

equipment, as here, manufacturers were accused of conspiring as

5

1

to who would bid what price.

2

claiming a combination that ameliorates the vigor of price

3

competition, that inhibits it, that breaks it.

4

It is not about that.

We are

To express the distinction as to the conduct, it

3

was as though the electrical equipment manufacturers in sub­

6

mitting competing bids to public utilities on a custom-made

7

machine, agreed among themselves in order to alleviate the

8

perils of inadvertent price cuts that any time a prospective

9

seller on a piece of business was uncertain as to what a com­

*0

petitor was bidding, that information would usually be accu­

11

rately supplied by the competitor upon request, and the favor

12

would be returned at some future point.

13

This is not a case that seeks to outlaw the avail­

14

ability of price information.

15

case supplied its members with monthly price trend figures, and

16

would weekly analyze price trend information computed for each

17

defendant and that is not challenged by the Government.

The Trade Association in this

pricing, and as the findings indicated, prior pricing to a

22

customer tended to be carried forward unless there were sig­

23

nificant cost changes or unless the market conditions altered,

24

and purchases could reveal, to competing bidders if they

25

thought it improved competition the bids they had received.

The defendants had available to

precision that inhibits price competition, a conclusion veri­

the parties to the information exchanged regarded it as

assurance against unnecessary price cuts.

It is a case which claims the defendants have

Finally, Mr. Justice Harlan, we do not claim that thej
agreement froze prices.

This industry, according to the
!

12

findings, has throughout the period in question been charac­

13

terized by over-capacity, a condition which ordinarily makes

14

for a vigorous price competition, that works to adjust capacity

15

to demand.

10

The fact that under the circumstances prices varied

17

and business shifted is not as significant as the uncontro-

18

verted fact that despite the chronic over-capacity new entrants

2

Perhaps I missed the point of something that

3

you said just a moment ago, the fact that there were new

entries into this business, into the production of fiber-

3r"

board boxes, this helps your case, you say?
A

6

Yes, the fact that there was extensive new

7

entry despite the fact of chronic over-capacity indicates that

3

something is wrong in the pricing.

9

pricing, typically over-capacity would lead to depression of

If you had competitive

business.
In our judgment the fact that you have new entry

despite the chronic over-capacity suggests that something isn't

working.

16

It is a sort of a conspiracy that promotes

17

A

I beg your pardon?

18

Q

It is a sort of conspiracy that promotes

19

competition?
A

20

Competition, Mr. Justice Harlan, is intended

21

to allocate resources most properly.

It is intended to have

22

people make informed decisions about when to leave the industry

and when to build new capacity.

to it.

25

that competition has not been working.

That is why we are committed

And the fact that you get the distortion here suggests

8

Q

i

Well*. Hr. Zimmerman,, it would be a good idea

2

for you to tell us precisely what it is that you complain of.

I have all of these things that you are not complaining of,

and it makes me feel pretty comfortable.

point in my argument.

think that the critical question was whether the defendants

!

The court found that each party made an individual

12
13

decision as to pricing after receiving the information, and

14

decided that no further agreement could be inferred.

15

fore refused to consider the significance of uncontroverted

16

evidence, which the court itself described as showing that most

defendants felt that the price information was needed to main­

exist.

It there-'

20

And here is my point, Mr. Justice Fortas.

21

We did not claim that in addition to the information

22

exchanged, you needed a further agreement on how to use the

23

information.

24

when a group of sellers who account for by far the dominant

25

share of the market combined to meet or call one another when

The proposition we advanced to the court is that

9

j

1

there was a substantial doubt as to what some member of the

2

group may be bidding on a particular piece of business, and

3

when they were motivated to such a combination by their con­

4

cern that failure to have such complete and precise informa­

S

tion could lead to price cutting — even though each party

6

walks away from the meeting with a nominal freedom to charge

7

as he pleases, the necessary effect of a laying the doubts

8

and resolving the uncertanties in this context is to mitigate

9

price competition.

10

Of course, if they had the further agreement as to

ii

specific prices, the arrangement would be blatantly and

12

criminally unlawful, but under the circumstances a further

13

agreement is not necessary, unless this be regarded as novel

14

doctrine I refer you to this court's decision in American

15

Column, 257 U.S., at 399, the court again in an information

16

exchange agreement noted that there was the absence of a

17

further agreement as to pricing.

I thought I had an understanding of this case

20

people?

21

A

There were; occasional meetings.

Most of the

exchanges were by telephone, or by oral contact.

Q

I thought so.

A

Yes.

There were occasional meetings, but it

doesn't make any difference whether they meet or whether they

Q

Maybe it doesn't and maybe it does.

But you say

mostly it was a matter of telephoning, --

4

A

Yes .

5

Q

And occasionally there were meetings?

6

A

There was communication.

7

Q

Were these meetings under the auspices of a

8

Trade Association, or pursuant to agreement, or what are you

9

referring to?

10

A

We are talking about a course of conduct here,

11

and in terms of the exchange of information this is simply a

\Z

course of conduct in terns of the telephone calls and the

13

occasional meetings which I suppose happened after Trade

14

Association meetings aided.

13

tipified this industry over the eight-year period covered by

16

the complaint, and apparently it preceded the complaint.

17
18

Q

This was a course of conduct that

Your complaint is that at these meetings or in

these telephone conversations --

19

A

In the telephone calls, yes.

20

Q

— when a competitor or one member of the

21

industry, one member would tell another what it had charged

22

a particular customer?

23

A

Mo, it is more complicated than that.

A com­

24

petitor would ask the other competitor, "What is your price to

25

'X* whom you are now supplying?"
11

\

Q

What does that mean, what has been your price?

2

A

No, it includes — there are two types of price

3

information generally that were supplied»

The last quoted

4

price or a current quote, it varied from competitor to com­

S

petitor, but the point is that the information requested was

6

readily understood as indicating the current price.

7

a current quote indicates the current price.

8

quote in this industry is a vary good indication of the current

9

price, because of the finding, that there was a persistency

Certainly

The last sale

10

of prior prices.

11

at a given price, it typically, barring certain changes in the

12

industry, would requote that price.

If a company had been supplying a customer

So that this information, when exchanged, was mean­
ingful to the parties asking it.

15

Q

Did this go beyond the 1940 consent decree?

16

A

Yes, the 1940 consent decree was not a per­

17

missive decree, but the 1940 consent decree spoke of past

18

prices, and in this respect I think it went beyond the

19

Section 3 of the 1940 consent decree.

20
21

22

Q

That decree did permit, what was it, seven of

the — no nine of the defendants here?
A

I believe eight defendants gave only their most

23

recent price rather than a current quote, but as I indicate

24

that most recent price is readily translatable, and, of course,

2§

that decree didn't permit, it simply indicated its limitations.
12

t

Q

1

z

To the extent that it did, you are charging

communication of the most recent price?

3

A

Yes.

4

Q

And then you are charging them with doing

5

something that was expressly permitted by the consent decree,

6

these particular defendants?
A

7

As the court below points out the consent decree

3

does not repeal the anti-trust laws.

9

the limitations of that decree were.

10
11

12

It simply indicated what

Trade Association here to the activities permitted by Maple

15

all of the information that Maple Flooring permitted them to.

16

The Association did that.

17
18
19

20

Q

They exchanged

You are saying that they did something beyond,

Maple Flooring, something beyond the exchange of information?
A

Exchange of information as to past and closed

transactions.

21

Q

You say they did something beyond that?

22

A

Yes.

23

Q

Did it go as far ---

24

A

It included currentinformation.

25

Q

-- as to what theywere
13

going to charge?

|
3

1

A

In the case of some defendants we have explicit

2

evidence that they gave current quotes, that they now have

3

to a purchaser.

4

In the case of the closed quotes, the practice in

S

this industry was such that this could be readily assumed to

0

give a very good indication of what the next quote would be.

7

Now I think that, the court below failed to look at

8

the uncontroverted deposition evidence,, because it misconceives

9

the teachings of the prior cases.

The prior cases don't say

10

that you need an additional agrement.

11

that the additional agreement can be the missing link, and I

12

quote the American Column, the missing link the absence of the

13

agreement on how to use the prices supplied by the disposition

14

of men to follow their most intelligent competitors.

15

to make the most money possible, and by the system of reports

16

which makes discovery of price reductions inevitable and

17

immediate.

18

The prior cases say

It is

To illustrate what the uncontroverted deposition

19

evidence indicated, I would like to refer you to page 32 of our

20

brief, where we have the following colloquy:

21

Were you ever requested for information by the

same competitors?

23

"A

Other officials testified that the exchange of
i

7

information prevented destructive price competition,' avoided

a

the necessity of pricing as low as he was willing to go.

9

The District Court erroneously, because it insisted

10

on a further agreement, ignored this evidence.

But even if we

ii

didn’t have this evidence, we think that the necessary affect

12

here where you have information requested at tira e s of un­

1.3

certainty by members of a relatively small group of sellers,

14

six of whom did almost 60 percent of the business, under cir­

15

cumstances where self~intere3t would dictate minimization of

16

the rigors of price competition, and where the buyer's demand

17

was fixed, we think that under such a situation so long as

18

pricing was clearly visible to one another, so long as any

19

uncertainty was avoided, it would not pay anyone substantially j

20

to cut prices, since the others could know of and match the

21

cut, and the share of the business would be apt to remain the

22

same at a lower profit.

i

]

23

The individual self-interest of each participant could

24

be relied upon to mitigate competition.

25

to exchange information was in effect, and predictably, and
15

Once the combination

3

this is important, evidence showed and the court found that

2

in the majority of instances the recipient of the information

3

in fact quoted substantially the same price it had received.

4

The District Court stresses the fact that the infor­

5

mation exchanged was for the purpose of enabling informed

6

marketing decisions, but the court treats informed decision

7

making with an undiscriminating reverence, dand linseed oil

8

and American Column shows the dangers of over-specificity on

9

current prices.

10

The point is that but for the information exchanged,

11

occasions would have arisen when the defendants would have

12

been slightly in the dark as to how low they would have to bid.;

13

These are the occasion when the buyers determined it is not in j

14

their self-interest to educate the bidders as to the precise

15

state of the competition.

j

16

On those occasions, but for the combination, the
l

17

competitors would have consulted their own costs and the

18

extensive general price information available to them, and

19

submitted a price that warranted them a profit.

20

Defendants argue that without the information they

21

may have bid too high but they had a good idea of the level of

22

prices, and if they bid too high the buyer would probably tell

23

them and in fact the court found that many buyers gave high

24

bidders a second chance to meet the low price.

25

It is not in the buyer's interest by being silent to

16

I

1

induce high price.

2

Indeed, if a want of specific information, a serious risk

3

existed that the uninformed seller would bid too high., one

4

wonders why each competi.tor assisted his colleague to avoid

5

such a mistake.

6

Q

He is interested in inducing low prices.

I am sorry to interrupt you again, but would you

7

tell us just what information, if any, as to price, you believe

8

that these companies could lawfully exchange and what informa"

9

tion they could not and as to the exchange of which you are

10
11

here complaining?
A

Very simply, Mr. Justice Fortas, they could and

12

did exchange through their Trade Association information as to

13

past pricing behavior in the industry.

14
15
16
17

Q

I don’t understand that.

What does that mean?

Does thatmean past prices?
A

At every ten days they would compute what the

prices had been?

18

Q

Average prices?

19

A

Average prices, the previous week, average

20

prices with some breakdown according to region, and some break­

21

down according to type of box.

22
23

Q

And you distinguish between that and prices

to individual customers, is that your point?

24

A

Yes, I distinguish between that and prices to

25

individual customers.
17

?

Secondly, they could receive from the buyers, infor­

2

mation as to what their competitors were selling, if the buyer

3

wanted to give it to them.

4

We have no objection to that.

Thirdly, they could publish to the world their price

S

lists and we have no objection to that, because price lists are

6

general, and people can discount from price lists in specific

1

cases.
It is when they call up to one another and agree

8
9
10

upon the exchange of information as to the specific price to
a specific customer.

Yes, well one can deduce an agreement or a

combination from a course of conduct.

Yes, we are charging a combination to exchange

information, an agreement to exchange information.

which in the context of this particular industry was a very

9

good indication of what the seller who gave that information

10

11

would next charge.
Now, we argue that the buyer would not ordinarily

12

act against his self-interest and by remaining silent for

'13

sellers to bid too high, and we think that as this court has

14

recognized, extensive and specific information on current

15

price is available to a relatively small group of sellers,

IS

buying for the same market, will result in mitigation of

17

competition.

18

The agreement here, the combination, the under­

19

standing, evidenced by the course of conduct over eight years

20

and before, can be understood by a seller’s desire to avoid

21

the possibility that his opponent if kept in the dark may come

22

in at a lower price, and again I note the explicit testimony,

23

which revealed this, and which I referred to earlier, and the

24

court’s finding that in most cases, in fact upon receiving

25

information, the recipient quoted the same price as the

I would like to turn for a moment to the question
of whether there was a combination .

regarded as unilateral conduct, as in theater enterprises.

There were two parties to each request, and

Furthermore, the District Court itself referred to

9

10

an implied understanding that by giving the information one

11

gets the right to request the information and indeed I read

12

appellee’s brief, on page 13, to concede that.
Hence, the conduct is not only bilateral, joint, it

Finally, the fact that each company maintained its

freedom to furnish information was another way of stating that

it retained the right to depart and go off the air.

The fact

10

that they usually furnished information rather than always

11

furnish information does not mean that there was not a course

12

of conduct here.

13

Such usual conduct over an eight-year period is

14

evidence enough of a combination, even the most explicitly

conceived of conspiracy does not operate to perfection.

Q

Mr. Zimmerman, as I understood you earlier in

the argument, you took the position that the history of over­

19

production in this industry, and the history of new entries

20

into it, somehow helped to establish your case in this specific

21

restraint of trade?

We are not relying on it, Mr. Justice Stewart.

You establish a restraint of trade in this type

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WHITNEY NORTH SEYMOUR, ESQ.

2
3

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. SEYMOUR:

Let me in the few minutes just try to

4

summarize the situation as I see it as a result of Mr.

5

Zimmerman's argument.

6

This case, all of the respondents have filed a

7

common brief in this case because the question was common, to

8

all of them.

9

defendants from time to time, when they couldn't get the

The common denominator was that all of the

10

information from their own records and they didn't trust the

11

information when they got it from the buyer, would call up

12

another manufacturer and ask him for his last price.

13

This was done by telephone and this is the universal

14

practice which is challenged in this case, and the Government

15

says, on that fact alone, and the speculation that people

18

would not cut their prices any more than they had to, we have

17

established a combination or violation of the law.

10

Now the meetings that counsel has talked about, as

'19

your Honors will find, are a few small trade gossip meetings

20

involving three or four of the defendants, and not challenged

21

as illegal and not part of this practice at all.

22

just thrown in for color and the practice was, this tele-

23

phoning practice, which I have referred to, now Mr. Zimmerman

24

said that after they telephoned, the fellow who got the

25

information was nominally free to go about his business.
24

They were

1

It is stipulated and it is found that everyone of

2

the prices fixed was fixed in the individual judgment of the

3

seller, in his business judgment alone.

4

not a word of proof in this case that he was under any re­

6

straint or under any coercion.

7

He wasnsfc nominally

He was free, and he exercised that freedom, and there is

Now I will come after recess to the precise manner

8

of competition, and the fact that there was who3.esale price

S

cutting in this industry, and the prices went down, and the

10

prices varied, and the people were taking away customers all

11

of the time from other people and they were not nominally free,

12

they were free.

13

That is the heart of it.

14

What is the Government really challenging here?

The

15

Government is really challenging the Maple Flooring decision

16

under the guise of not challenging it by saying that when ther^.

17

is an exchange of price information or when there is price

10

information furnished, and the word exchange is not an accurate

19

one, because there wasn't an exchange here, each company some­

20

times called another company and got information, so in that

21

sense there was an exchange.

22

What they are really saying is that such a practice,

23

one not disapproved, not specifically disapproved in the

24

consent decree which has been on the books for 28 years and

25

which everybody has relied upon, that such a practice is now

25

1

per se unlawful, and that the court ought to so declare,

2

because this case was tried on a stipulation, the findings

3

were largely agreed to, and where the findings weren't agreed

4

to they were based upon documents or other stipulation, and

5

so the Government is coming in and asking the court somehow

6

to review, not just ordinary findings of a District Court, but

7

to sort of renegotiate the stipulation .

I

8
9
10

I submit that when your Honors look at the stipulation,
and the findings, you will find that the conclusion that the
District Court reached was inescapable on this record,,

11

Now, if there is a case, some other case, in which

12

there is supplying of price information, and some kind of an

13

agreement as to the prices, some kind of a stabilizing of the

14

prices, some kind of a uniformity of the prices none of which

15

were present here, let them bring such a case, and give this

16

court and the Trial Court the economic basis which this court

17

has insisted in White Motors and others is essential if it is

18

to expand the group of per se violations.

19

This is not a proper case for expansion.

20

So that is the summary of our position, and I will

21

just say this in addition before the lunch recess, that this

22

was a practice followed by the IS defendants in this case,

23

those in existence at the time of the consent decree by them

24

and by their successors, large and small, and it was regarded

25

as vital to their operation to know what the price alterneitives

Mr. Seymour, you may

MR. SEYMOUR:

May it please the court:

Perhaps just

a little more on the nature of this industry.
As I think I said, this case challenges a trade

11

practice which goes back to at least 1940, when the consent

12

decree, which did not enjoin the dissemination of information

13

on past transactions was entered, there are 18 of the 51

14

companies in the Southeastern part of the United States

15

involved in the case.

16

The number of companies and the number of plants has

17

grown, because the business of the customers has grown.

18

has been an enormous increase in the furniture business in the

19

Southeast, and that is one of the main purposes of the use of

20

these containers.

25

therefore in order to get-information to enable a company to

There is no

28

1

2

and stipulated, that it was vital to have information about

3

various alternatives, here, as elsewhere, and the usual method

4

of getting information was to -- if the seller had sold the

5

purchaser before, to look at his own record, and if not, ask

6

the potential customer#tat he was buying for, and usually the

7

customer supplied that information.

8

9

Obviously, it was to their advantage to do so, and if
not that, then occasionally, and usually according to the

10

findings where they had some doubt about information which was

11

supplied by the customers, did the practice of telephoning and

12

getting information from competitors.

13

But when the information was obtained from

com­

14

petitors, while the findings indicate that in a majority of

15

cases the new potential supplier would bid the same amount

16

that he understood was being bid by his competitors, if he

17

couldn’t get the business that way, he would cut the price, and

Yes.

S

A

Yes .

7

Q

Is this same arrangement open to the others,

8

the other 53, and do they participate in the same thing as the

9

18?

10

A

I can’t answer that, but I have no reason to

db out that it is»

I don't know whether it is or not»

The

12

case was brought charging only these 18.

13

about others, but I can assume that an industry practice of

14

this character is probably followed by everybody.

Nobody ever inquired

15

The consent decree was relied on by everybody, and

16

probably the practice was followed by everybody, but I can't

17

answer your Honor specifically.

18

I said before recess that this case was stipulated

19

largely on stipulated facts, and I think it is important to

20

realize that, because it is upon the stipulation and the agreed

21

findings that the court below largely based its judgment.

22

And in this case Mr. Lewis Bernstein, who is here,

23

handled the case for the Government in the lower court, and

24

handled it in a very statesman like fashion.

25

able and tough adversary.
30

He is a vary

i

The court urged the parties to try to get together

2

on stipulations instead of taking the court's time with a lot

3

of miscellaneous testimony and exhibits, and after Mr. Bern­

4

stein had deposed 34 representatives of the defendants, they

5

proceeded to the stipulation table, and after some months

6

there, the stipulations which are in this record were arrived
.

7
8
9

I submit that it is not an occasion for looking into
little fragments of the deposition, as Mr. Zimmerman did in
)

10

one reference this morning and saying, "Well, look at this.

11

Here the Government has stipulated the facts, the basic facts,

12

the broad sweep of facts."

13

But I submit there is no occasion for the Court to

14

have to revert to these depositions, but if you do, you will

15

find as in

IS

that some say one thing and some say another, and it is out

17

of the total of this that this stipulation was arrived at.

18

most

other depositions or testimony of 34 witnesses,

You can find a little fragment here or a little

19

fragment there that will support almost anything, but you can’t

20

find any that would show there was any agreement on price, or

21

that anybody was constrained as to what price he should charge

22

and didn't have full freedom of action, and that, I submit

23

is the key to it.

24
25

Q

Mr. Seymour, I suppose that if there were price

uniformity or price stability of this industry, that the fact
31

i

1

of the exchange of price information would be some evidence

2

of a combination, in a conventional anti-trust figure?

3

4
S

A

I have no doubt it would be pointed to as some

evidence of that.
Q

It could be relied on as some evidence of that.

e

Now the Government admits, as I understand it, that there is

7

no indication of price stability here.

0

I get it, is that there would have been more vigorous com­

9

petition than if there had not been this exchange of

10

it

What they say is, as

information.
Is that your understanding of the theory?
i

12

A

Mr. Zimmerman, if I understood him, said "If

1.3

you assume the effects, you can establish the restraint," and

14

that is the Government's case.

15

They assume, without any proof, that it has had this

16

effect upon competition, and upon that assumption they say that

17

it was a combination in the restraint of trade.

18

The trouble with it is, there is no such proof and

19

so it is only a matter of assumption.

20

of stipulation, one other thing which I think is significant,

21

these stipulations were arrived at after the Government had

22

a Grand Jury investigation, which did not result in an indict­

23

ment, when they called many witnesses and had gotten thousands ;

24

of documents, and we supplied, the defendant supplied the

25

list of 10,000 customers, they apparently found no customer

32

Nov/, just on the fact

1

who complained about this practice because no customer was ever

2

called and there is no testimony or stipulation showing what

3

a customer would testify on this subject»

4

And I submit that the case is not a proper one for

5

the court to go behind the stipulations as if the parties had

8

made different stipulations.

7

Q

Mr. Seymour, did I understand Mr. Zimmerman to

8

say that in addition to the stipulation, there was an agreement

9

upon many of the findings of fact?

10

A

Yes, if your Honor will look in Volume I ——

1?

Q

I notice here at page 483, there are 326

12

13
14

findings of fact.
A

The agreed findings begin at page 55, and run on

for 150 pages.

15

Q

Those are the agreed findings?

IS

A

Those are the findings with an indication in

17

the margin as to whether they were agreed or not agreed

18

and the agreed findings are the basis for the Trial Court’s

19

findings, and those agreed findings, in turn, were based upon '

20

the underlying stipulation which is also in this record.

21

are several stipulations.

.

There

22

Q

Did the District Court make some findings?

23

A

Yes, if your Honor will look at that agreed set

24

of findings, you will see some matters which are underlined,

25

where the parties did not agree, and there, in some cases, the
33

1

court based its conclusion on the stipulation or documents of

2

record, made independent findings.
But the critical findings, the dispositive findings,

3
4

here, stem from the stipulation in the agreement, I think.
If your Honors will look at the sweep of those agreed

5
6

findings, and the sweep of the practice of price competition

7

and the need for this information and how it was used, you

8

will see one other thing, which I ought to mention at this

9

stage.

10

If a supplier had supplied the cxistoxner before, he

11

could find out the price from looking at his own records, the

12

price he charged.

13

Now, one did not always adhere to the same price, and

14

he couldn't rely on the fact that another supplier would adhere

15

to the same price, because it is also stipulated that if there

16

were charges in costs, or in supply, or changes in specifi-

17

cations, those prices would not be adhered to,.

I
t

18
19

20

So you cannot take it that, just because the price
was charged once, that it will still be the same charge.
After the records of the supplier as a source, the

21

supplier would then ask the customer and the customer would

22

supply information, sometimes information which the supplier

23

doubted, but usually supplied information.

24
25

The important part of this is that it didn't make
the slightest difference where the information was obtained as
34

!

to how the seller got the information behaved.

2

exactly the same way in seeking further business whether he

3

got the information front his records or from a customer, or

4

from a competitor, and, therefore, to say that any of the

5

alleged detects stem from this exchange of price information

6

seems to me to be without foundation.

7

He behaved

Now, 1 am going to push on here and say only chat,

B

as we said in our brief that I think the Government’s statement

9

of the questions really rather bely the fact that this record

10

was stipulated, and bases it rather on some fragments here and

11

there, I said before recess that, really, there was a common

\%

denominator here of the practice which was challenged,

13

was the practice of getting information by telephone, and then

14

supplying it in due course when it wets asked for on a wholly

15

different transaction.

.

18

which

Mr. Zimmerman said this morning that in some cases

17

people gave not only past transaction information, but current

■18

quote information.

IS

Now, it is clear from the findings that only a part

20

of all the defendants ever supplied quote information, but the

21

case was tried on the assumption that it was the common

22

denominator information that was the thing that bound all

23

these defendants together.

24

Therefore, X submit that there is no occasion to

25

explore separately the few cases where there was quotation
35

\

information supplied.

2

If that made a difference, the court would have to

3

dispose of the case by dismissing as to some and not as to

4

others, and what the Government was trying to do, as it is

5

trying to do here, is to hold all of the defendants together

6

on the exchange of information about past transactions.
And the fact that some of the defendants might have

7
3

interpreted that phrase differently I think does not affect the

9

basic legal position.
Now on the question of combination, I won't take any

10

real time on that.

I must say that the cases don’t clarify

12

entirely what is a combination and what is a conspiracy, or an

1.3

agreement.

14

Here, what happened was that a supplier would call

15

up another supplier and ask for some information, knowing that

IS

in due course that supplier might expect to have the courtesy

17

to reciprocate, not in connection with that transaction, but

18

in connection with a wholly different transaction, and that is

19

all there is in the way of consentual basis,for whatever you

20

want to call this.

1

21

Each supplier at some time asked, and then as a

22

matter of reciprocal courtesy at some other - time supplied some

23

inforraation, sometimes a few requests, sometimes more requests,

24

and so you have a sort of a situation of reciprocal commercial

25

courtesy at work.
36

1

j

ic

i

Now the Government says that is enough to make it

2

a combination.

3

authorities on that subject, but it isn't vital, because if it

4

was a combination, it Weis not a combination to restrain trade,

3

because it did not result in restraining in any degree the

6

price which any supplier would get for his product.

It seems to me not to fit any of the existing

It did neither coerce nor restrain, and so, however

7
8

you break it down, if you say it was a combination, it was not

9

a combination in restraint of trade.

My own view is that the

10

District Court was quite right on this record in concluding

11

that this was sort of like the mutual courtesies which we all

12

do each other and which cannot be regarded as a combination

13

just because we expect them we we give them.
Q

14

No, nothing of the kind.

No, it is absolutely neutral on that point.

Mr. Seymour, is there anything in the record on

4

in no proof about the course of price history, and the de­

5

fendants

S

and these charts in Volume 3 show it.

7

The Government put

confronted with this kind of a record did their best,

Now the first chart in Volume 3

shows how prices

8

of everything else was going up while the prices of containers

9

were coming down, a result which one would not expect if there

10

was any kind of a price conspiracy or a price fixing arrange­

11

ment, however tenuous.

!

12

The next group of charts shows how the prices varied

13

between the defendants1 plants, and shows that there was

14

absolutely no uniformity of price as between defendants or

IS

within plants.

16

The next group of charts, which is a very significant

17

group, which begins on page 21, shows the business gained and

18

lost, by these defendants, and it shows on page 22, for example,:

19

in those columns, that each of these companies in every year

20

gained some business and lost some business to competitors,

21

22

and, for example, in this chart on page 22, the Container
'
Corporation, which is ray client, in the year 1960 did business

23

with about one-third of — about one-third of its customers

24

were people with whom it had not done any business the year

23

before, and about one-third were people with whom it didn't do
38

1
2

any business the year following.
Now it is found and stipulated, that generally

3

speaking, customers changed suppliers only when they got a cut

4

in price, and therefore it is reasonable to infer that all

5

these changes were a result of the price competition in the

S

industry, and the fact that there was widespread price cutting.

7

Now beyond that, the next group of charts shows

8

how the price went in almost like a seismograph during a

9

convulsion, when the prices went like this as between companies,

10

as between plants, and because of the difficulty of getting

11

more than five lines on a single chart -- these are rather

12

grouped geographically, as plants of various competitors.

13

But your Honors will see you look through these that

14

the price was all over the place, and was all over the place

15

as between plants and as between defendants.

16

Then, going on, there is another series of charts

17

toward the back of the volume which shows that there was a

18

great variation from so-called manuals.

19

a manual which it used to compute price, although they were

20

rarely, if ever, published, and their manual was departed from

21

as shown here, both up a.nd down --- usually down for manual.

22

So nobody who knew what anybody else's manual is,

23

24
.25

Now each company had

I

could surely compute the price.
Then finally, there is another group of charts in
that same part of the volume which show departure from board
39

1

prices, which was another possible way of computing the price.

2

Q

I am beginning to think that perhaps what the

3

Government is seeking is a per se rule with respect, not to

4

price fixing, but with respect to a ''combination,"1 to show

5

exchanged cxirrent price information.
A

©

I think that is perfectly evident.

What they

7

are saying is, "We are entitled to bar this access knowledge

8

among competitors who must thereafter compete in ignorance,

9

because

10

we say the effect might be to somehow chill price

competition."

n

There is no proof of that.

The proof is of the most

n

active kind of price competition, and the most destructive

13

kind, because it takes customers away in large numbers year

14

to year.

IS

Q

Mr. Seymour, on page 567, in the opinion of

1©

the District Court, it says that the plaintiff concedes that

\1

— the United States concedes that if it had only charged in

18

the complaint that the defendant had agreed to exchange price

19

information it would have no case.

20

A

Yes, sir.

21

Q

I take it that what you are saying is that the

22
21

Government is taking an entirely different position here?
A

I think the Government's position in the lower

24

court was if they just charged exchange "of price information"

as

they would have no case.

They went beyond that and charged the
40

i

effective price information, but they didn't prove any such

the natural effect of the exchange.

4

They relied as to its effect on what they said was

Q

Well, the court goes on and says that the —-

5

the District Court says that the plaintiff therefore has the

6

additional burden of showing that from such inferred agreement,

1

namely, to exchange price information, the court should

8

further infer that there was an agreement to use such exchange

9

price information.

10

A

What the court is saying, really, is that you

11

have to have a combination which restrains trade, and if there

12

was a combination it didn’t show any restraint of trade, and

13

whether you say it is one agreement or two agreements, it

14

doesn’t really make much difference.
The fact is that they did not prove any such re­

15
16

17
18

19

straint.

The record shows to the contrary.
Now let rae push on very rapidly just to touch on a

couple of other points.
The Government relies here on the cases decided before

20

Maple Flooring, American Column and Linseed Oil and a case

21

decided after Maple Flooring, and it says that this combination

22

was invalid under those cases.

23

Now, I won’t take your Honor's time to try to

24

describe those cases, but your Honors will recall that they

23

were a very tight and explicit arrangement by which, in every
41

I

case, information about prices was supplied, there was policingi

3

4

case they were stabilized.

5

In the Column case, the prices went up
In the other

There were fines and forfeitures in the Linseed Oil

6

case for any departure, and there is nothing of that kind here.

7

And Maple Flooring I submit lays down the principle that the

a

knowledge which invokes the self-interest of sellers andlets

9

the sellers use the knowledge to compete in any way that suits

10

their situation, which is the situation here, it clearly

11

permits the kind of information that was supplied here, and

12

that was recognized when the consent decree was made, largely

'13

in reliance on the Maple Flooring case.

But my friend says that in Maple Flooring they

:15

didn't have any information about particular customers.

But

16

they did in the Cement Institute case.

17

case, information was supplied about particular customers,

IS

because of the fact that in that case it was the practice to

519

order cement from a lot of different suppliers in order to

20

get a lower price even if you weren't going to use it and that

21

was kind of a commercial fraud and the information about that

could be exchanged.

I submit that —■ of course, the consent decree is

not binding on your Honors, but it is some precedent for the

fact that the Government has recognized for a long, long time

that this practice does not have the pernicious effects

alleged now, and if this practice does have such pernicious

effects so that your Honors can be asked to extend again the

not to be assumed just on the basis of speculation.

17

Q

Mr. Zimmerman, before we go to the next case,

18

I would like to ask you the same question I asked Mr. Seymour

19

about these 18 people who were charged.

20

21
22
23
24

25

Are they the only ones who engaged in these practices
or is the practice open to all 53 of them in the business?
A

j

Again, I have to give the same answer that

Mr. Seymour gave, Mr. Chief Justice.
I do not know.

The only information that I have is

that the President of the Dixie Company testified that he
43
8

1

exchanged information only with people that he could trust.
{

£

There is some suggestion that the exchange may not have

3

included everyone in the industry, but beyond that I cannot

4

say, and I don't think the record discloses it»

5

Q

I understood, Mr. Seymour, that some of these

6

were large companies and some were small companies.

Why would

you pick out some of the small companies and join them with

these big companies, and not join the others* in a lawsuit?

A

Well, we picked out all the substantial eompanieis

10

There were a number of new entrants.

1 don't know how many

11

of the other companies would have been relatively new entrants,

12

but I assume we chose those as to whom we have evidence.

13

The Grand Jury which began this was inspired by a

14

complaint of a customer, and I suppose we tracked the Grand

15

Jury to see who was involved in this.

16

Q

Mr. Zimmerman,

may I take advantage of this to

17

ask you whether you agree that the Government is seeking a

per se rule here?

19

of an anti-trust laws once you have proved that there is a

20

combination among the defendants to exchange current price

21

information as to individual customers?

22
23

A

That is to say, that it is a per se violatic n

No, I think the rule we are advancing here,

Mr. Justice Fortas, is that when you have an industry which
is dominated by a relatively small number of sellers, then the!

pricing, because of the ability of that small group to

As to effact, yes»

Now in this case we have

explicit proof that this was their purpose, but the court

a subsequent agreement, and we don’t, and American Column makes

it clear that we don't.
Q

10
11

You don't claim that you have any proof in this

record as to specific effect on price in the market?
