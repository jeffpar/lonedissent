CHIEF JUSTICE WARRENs

The first case on the calen­

dar is No. 43, William J» McCarthy, petitioner, versus the
United States»
Mr» McCarthy?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAURICE J. MCCARTHY, ESQ»
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, MCCARTHYs

Maurice J. McCarthy, appearing on

behalf of the petitioner, William J. McCarthy.
1 am sure th® question has occurred to the Court, so
I will clear it up initially»
related»

The petitioner and I are not

The fact that we have the. same last names is purely

coincidence»
The facts in the case are not complicated %
On April I, 1966, a three-count indictment was re­
turned against th© petitioner, charging income tax evasion
under section 7201 of th® Internal Revenue Code, and alleging
that there were deficiencies in taxes of approximately $900
for the year of 1959, $5,000 for the year 1960, and $.1,200
■for the year 1961»
On April 14, 1366, the petitioner appeared in the
District Court with retained counsel and at that time counsel
waived the reading of the indictment and entered a plea of not
guilty to each of the three counts»
for the 15th of June 1966»
2

I

The Court set the trial

1

Thereafter — which the record does not disclose —

2

the trial was reset for June 30 , 1966«,

On June 29, 1966,

3

Government counsel, appearing ex parte, informed the Court

4

that the petitioner’s illness made it impossible to try the

5

case and asked for a continuance»

6

the case to the 15th of July»

The District. Judge reset

On the 2,5th of July, the petitioner, again appearing

7

a

with retained counsel, appeared for the trial of the case,,

9

that time, counsel for the petitioner informed the Court that

At

10

he would like to withdraw the plea of not guilty to Count 2

11

of the indictment and to offer a plea of guilty to that count,

12

which was the allegation of approximately $500 in unpaid taxes

13

for the year I960»
The Court interrogated counsel for the Government,

14

15

who indicated that upon acceptance of the plea of guilty,

16

Government counsel would move to dismiss Counts 1 and 3»

17
18

District Judge at that time questioned the defendant personally
as to two matters»
First of all, he asked the defendant, on the trial

The

level, if he v/as aware that by pleading guilty he waived his
right to a jury trial»

The defendant responded in the affir­

mative»
He then asked concerning the statutory penalties
of five years imprisonment and a maximum five-year imprison­
ment and a maximum $10,000 fine.
3

1

Upon receiving affirmative responses, the District

E

Judge entered a finding of guilty*

3

counsel asked the District Judge to inquire of the defendant

4

whether any threats or promises had been made.

5

Judge did inquire, and received negative responses? that no

6

threats had been made and no promises had been given.

At this point, Government

The District

No further questioning was had either of the defen­

8

dant or of retained counsel, and the case was set for a sen­

9

tencing hearing in September 1966, on September 14th.

10

At that time, the petitioner again appeared with re­

n

tained counsel, and the District Judge, in the allocution

12

procedure, asked the defendant personally if he had anything to

13

say.

14

his health and the things that ha had gone through, it never

13

would have happened, and that it was not deliberate.

16

ther questions were asked of the defendant.

The defendant's response was that if it were not for

No fur­

The petitioner's counsel at that time was present

and the District Court directed its attention to him.

19

asked if he had a statement and he raade a brief statement.

20

Court then indicated that in view of the else of the amount

21

involved, that the deterrent effect of a sentence was necessary

22

and entered a sentence of one year imprisonment and a fine ©f

23

$2,500.

24
25

He was
The

Counsel for the petitioner on the District Court
level then asked to be heard.

He addressed the District Judge

4

and informed the District Judge of the facts concerning the
character of the defendant himself.

He indicated to the Court

that the defendant was at the time of the proceedings 65 years
old; that he had never been familiar with any Federal offense
of any sort; that he had a fine family.
He further informed the Court that the defendant had
just recently, approximately two months prior to the sentencing
hearing, which was at approximately the same time as the tender
of the plea of guilty, that the petitioner had become a member
of Alcoholics Anonymous because he had been an acute alcoholic
for some time.
He further informed the Court that at the time that
the crime was allegedly committed, that being the time of the
filing of the income tax return, that the petitioner had been
involved in v?hat counsel called a protracted drinking situation
from which he was hospitalised.

No questions concerning this

matter were asked of the counsel for the defendant in the Dis­
trict Court,
Counsel then spoke of the nature of the crime and of
the evidence that was present or apparently present on the
District Court level.

His exposition of the crime consisted

in saying that the books of the defendant had been negligently
kept and that this negligence, when it became gross, amounted
to criminal intent.

There was no questioning concerning the

exposition of the crime,
5

The Probation Officer then informed the Court that
the Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor of the defendant was present
in open court and available to testify concerning those matters »
The District Court did not take any testimony or confer with
the sponsor from Alcoholics Anonymous,
The District Court then refused to vacate or suspend
sentence and entered a stay of execution for approximately 15
days ,
The argument of the petitioner presents three

ques­

tions o
The first of these questions concerns Federal Rule 11

,

of the Rules of Criminal Procedure
July 1, 1966,

which was amended effective

Since this plea was tendered on July 15 „ 1966,

it is governed by the rule as amended.

That amendment, and the

notes of the Advisory Committee to this Court concerning the
addition of the wording in the rule which constitutes the amend *
ment, is critical in this case.
The amendment required that the District Court
address the defendant personally, rather than what had been the
practice in the past of allowing the Court to address counsel
for the defendant.

In this case, there was no questioning of

the petitioner other than on the matters which I have stated
in the exposition of the facts.
Our contention is that amended Rule 11 directs and
demands that the District Judge inquire personally of the

6

1

defendant as to his understanding of the nature of the charge. ]

a

This was never done.

3

of the acceptance of the plea of guilty on July 15, 1966, error]

4

was committed.

5

the sentencing hearing which occurred in September 1966 in

6

that certain facts were brought to the attention of the Dis­

7

trict Court which, required inquiry.

We contend that this error was compounded at

We have cited in our brief to this Court the universa...

8
9

We, therefore, contend that at the time

opinion of the lower courts, the Circuit Courts, that Rule 11

10

imposes on the District Judge a duty of.inquiry.

We feel that

11

in view of the facts presented to the District Judge, this duty

12

of inquiry wa3 vary right and yet no inquiry was had of the

13

defendant personally or even of his counsel for that matter, or

14

the other persons who were available to give information.
■

Q

15
16

What is the provision in Rule 11 upon which you

rely for that last argument?
A

17

There is no provision in Rule 11 concerning the j

18

duty of inquiry.

19

District Judge must address the defendant personally and deter­

20

mine.

But the prevision in Rule 11 is that the

I draw from this the conclusion —

21

Q

And determine that the plea is made voluntarily?;

22

A

Voluntarily, with an understanding of the nature

■

23

of the charge and the consequences of the plea.

24

this the conclusion, and I support it with case law in our

25

briefs, that there is a duty of inquiry on the District Judge

7

I draw from

both at the time that the plea is accepted and later when sen­
tence is rendered against- the defendant to inquiry in the event
that any fact is presented to the Judge concerning the nature
of the crime or the character of the defendant.
In this case* there was no questionining whatever,
not one question of the petitioner himself as to what he under­
stood to be the nature of the accusation, nor of the petition­
er's counsel.

Both of these persons were present and available

to testify and much of the confusion in the record could have
been cleared up had the District Judge addressed questions to
them.
Q

I hope this will not disturb the order of your

argument, but X would like to call your attention to the last
sentence of Rule 11, as amended.

I take it from reading your

brief that although you refer to that last sentence, you don8t
really rely on it.

You recall that the last sentence says that

the Court shall not enter a judgment upon the plea of guilty
unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the
plea.
What was the date of the entry of judgment upon the
plea?
A

Judgment was entered on September 14, 1966.

Q

And at that time, X think the record shows that

the Judge had before him, and had consulted, the presentence
report»
8

1

A

Yes„ he did* Your Honor„

2

Q

And at that time, do I correctly recall that he

3

referred to the certain bookkeeping difficulties revealed by the

4

presentence report?

5

A

Yes g he did«,

6

Q

Do you argue that there was no explicit finding»

7

however B by •the Court in September that it was satisfied that

0

there was a factual basis for fell© plea?

9

int?

Was there such a, find-

10

A

Nog there was no such finding»

11

Q

You do not argue that the Court has to make such

12
13
14

an explicit finding„ do you?
A

I don't read that in your brief»

I don't argue that there must be an explicit

finding? iso.

15

Q

why not?

IS

A

The wording of the rule, itself, does not re­

17
10

19
20

)

quire an explicit finding»
Q

You read "unless it is satisfied" as referring

to a mental state which the Judge does not have to make explicit ?
A

Well, one thing I see in there as explicit is

21

that the Judge must make a determination that the plea is made

22

voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge

23

and the consequences of the plea»

24

Q

That is the first part of ifc«

25

A

The latter part of the rule 1 read to require
9

i
i

1

the Judge to be satisfied in the circumstances that a factual

2

basis exists for the plea»

3

does not say of the acts which constitute the charge „ that he

4

is satisfied that those acts occurred,

5

Q

It does not say for the charge»

What do you think that last sentence means?

It

How

6

can he be satisfied that the plea is justified without having

7

soma basis for believing that the defendant did the act?

8

A

1 think this is the argument which we made,, Your
I

9
10

Honor * in our brief,, that there are two elements to the crime ,
since this is a specific intent crime.

There are the acts
1

11

and there is the intent»
Q
But you don't tie them, as I remember -- and per-j

12

13

haps 1 am wrong — you don't tie that argument into this last

14

sentence# do you?

15

A

Perhaps not as artistically as 1 should have.

13

Q

2 don't say that critically.

I am trying to find

17

out your theory.

After all# 1 believe 1 am correct in saying

18

that this is the first time that the amendments of Rule 11

19

have been before us.

20

A

As far as I understand it# that is correct.

21

Q

1 confess a little surprise at the sort of lack

22

of reliance on that last sentence.

But I take it now# from

23

what you have said# that you regard .it as referring only to a

24

mental state of the Court which did not have to be reflected in

25

any finding or any statement by the Court.

.

10

1

Suppose at the time of the entry of judgment, the

2

Court had before it a presentence report which did not* however,,

3

make any reference whatever to the particular crime.

4

that is possible.

5

There is nothing before fch© Court whatever except the indictment

6

the plea of guilty^ and a presentence investigation report that

7

makes no reference to the particular crime of either the defen­

0

dant or his counsel.

I suppose

I have sesen presentence reports like that.

In your opinion , would that satisfy the lest sentence!

3
to

A

No, X don't think it would, Your Honor.

n

Q

I miss in your brief any discussion of questions

12

as to whether this last sentence was or was not satisfied in

13

your case.
A

14

My argument is this s that error occurred at the

15

time of acceptance of the plea.

16

there would have been no presentence report.

17

not consider the presentence report as controlling in any way.

18

I feel thereafter that the matters occurring in open court and

10

the information supplied to the District Judge in open court

20

served to compound the error by indicating to the District Judge1

21

that there was no factual basis for the plea.
Q

22

Had that error not occurred,
I, therefore, do

I am afraid that is the way I read your brief.

23

So it means if we don't agree with you about the first part of

24

Rule 11, that you are out of court, so far as your argument is

25

concerned.

11

1

If we don’t agree with yon about the application of

2

the phrase in Rule 11 "in this case/3 that is, that the Court

3

must first address the defendant personally and determine that

4

the plea is made voluntarily, et cetera, if we don't agree with

5

you about that, then your argument falls, because you treat the

6

last sentence as a mere appendage.

1

You get some support to that, I agree, from the

7

8

reporter's note, the advisory note.

9

argument?
A

10

Am I correct about your

I have not argued that that, last part of the
i

11

rule is mandatory because of the language of the rule itself»

12

It says the District Court must be satisfied.

13

which leaves some room for argument.

This is a word

My position, and the position of the petitioner, is

14
15

that in view of the matters occurring in open court, any deci­

16

sion which the District Court same to was not founded upon a

17

reasonable basis? that the Court was informed of matters which

18

required further inquiry? was informed of the age and inexpert

19

ience with criminal matters.of the defendant? was informed.of

20

his past alcoholic condition both at the time that the plea

21

was tendered and at the time that the crime was alleged to have

22

been committed? and was informed that counsel for the petitioner

23

had made an exposition of the crime which was incorrect.
Counsel had said that negligence could constitute the j

24
25

|

crime.

The last decision of this Court on defining tax evasion,.
12

1

the Sansone case, cited in our brief, indicates that willfulness

.is the characteristic element* that specific intent is the

3

characteristic element of the crime„

Q

7

A

Concerning the factual basis of the plea?

Well*

as the notes of the committee indicate* the reason for that

11

particular sentence was to insure that a defendant who may have

13

The

DoesnBt it

appear just from the language of that sentence that the idea

19

was to see that the Court* before sentencing a man* is satis-

A

This is the second part of our argument* Your

Honor* that there is an abuse of discretion in this case.
13

1

Q

I understand your brief on pages 24 to 29, about

z

five or six full, printed pages, has the thrust of your argu­

3

ment, almost precisely, to be what Mr. Justice Fortas' questions::

4

suggested? that is, that there was not compliance in this case

5

with the final sentence in newly amended Rule 11»

6

A

Exactly, Your Honor»

Is that right?

But I frame it in terms

?

of an abuse of discretion on the part of the District Court be­

8

cause I don9t find that language to be sufficiently specific.

9

The language is that the Court must be satisfied.

That is why

10

I couch the argument in terras of discretion and an abuse there­

11

after.

'12

The counsel for the respondent argues that the rule

13

leaves some discretion in the District Court, although he would

n

apply it also to the first part of Rule 11 concerning the tak­

15

ing and accepting of a plea of guilty.

16

does not address himself to the facts in this case which we

17

argue required inquiry by the District Judge,

18

Our third argument —

19

Q

20
21

22
23
24
25

However, the respondent

Mr. McCarthy, do you put any responsibility on

the retained counsel, and I do mean "any"?
A

Of course there is responsibility on retained

counsel, Your Honor.
Q

Is your position that the fact that they didn't

call the Alcoholics Anonymous man is enough?
A

No»

14

Q

What, should the Court do?

Go out and subpoena

A

The Court is required under Rule 11 to address

witnesses?

the defendant personally and to determine that he, the defen­
dant, understands the nature of the charge and the consequences
of the plea.
Q

Don't you think the Judge was right in taking

into consideration that this man might have been fit for Alco­
holics Anonymous but that wasn’t sufficient?
A

I am quite sure that being a member of —

Q

There is the lawyer’s statement that this man

was a fit candidate for Alcoholics Anonymous,

What else did

the Judge have?
A

The Judge had the age of the defendant»

The

defendant was 65 years of age.

in jail»

Q

That is discretionary, isn’t it?

A

Yes»

Q

That is, if he wants to put a 65-year-old man

That is discretionary.
A

What else did the Court have?

The question isn’t whether or not to put a 65-

year-old man in jail»

The question is whether or not a 65-

year-old man sufficiently understands the nature of the charge.
This is the question, whether he has been informed and under­
stands the meaning of the accusation.
Q

Would your argument be the same if he was 45?15

A

I think a man more in the prime of his life

would be less likely to be confused about these matters„

This

is perhaps in the discretion of the Courts but this is pre­
cisely my argument; that the discretion of the Court was not
properly exercised.
Q
A

Why?
Some men of advanced years have extreme acumen?

some do not.
Q

What should the Judge do at that stage?

Put

him on the stand?
A

Rule 32 requires at the sentencing hearing that

the District Judge address the defendant personally.

This,

again, imposes
Q
A

He did in the original hearing.
He did inquire of the defendant at the sentenc­

ing hearing and the defendant said the following;
"If it were not for my health and the things I have
gone through, it wouldn't have happened and it is not
deliberate."
A statement such as "it is not deliberate" is a point
blank denial of the characteristic element of the crime under
7201.
Q

What should the Court have done, then?

A

The Court should have inquired as to what he

meant by "it is not deliberate.01
16

Q

Suppose he had done that?

Would it be all rights

Would it have been enough?
A

It would have been what the military calls ''provi­

dence" on the record»
Q

The military?

A

I cited to this Court cases from the Court of

Military Appeals»
used»

I just use the phraseology which they have

What I mean is that there would have been in the record

evidence to have established that in open court the defendant
had been informed of the charge and had knowingly pleaded to
that charge.
Q

Couldn't the defendant, with or without the ad­

vice of his retained counsel, have volunteered what was good
for him,, or do you think the Court is obliged to inquire into
all of the materials?
I come back to my original question.

Don’t you think

retained counsel has some responsibility?
A

Yes, sir; of course retained counsel doss.

My last argument is on the constitutional question
involved here.

I think it is pointed up well by the alter­

natives suggested by counsel for the respondent.

Counsel for

the respondent says that this is the first case which has come
up on a direct appeal from the acceptance of a plea of guilty
which was not preceded by a motion to vacate or by a motion to
withdraw.
17

j

I note in my reply brief that the authority cited
by the respondent for this position, that the accepted and
usual methods are a motion to withdraw or a motion to vacate,
leave the defendant below with unconstitutional alternatives.,
If he moves to withdraw the plea, he must accept the
burden of proving innocence.

If he does that, it seems to me

that the Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process and -the pre­
sumption of innocence are reversed.
If he should move to vacate the sentence, that motion,
under 2255, can only be made when the defendant is in custody.
So the alternatives left open to the defendant in
a situation such as this are to either go into custody land
move to vacate, or accept a burden of proving innocence.

We

feel that this constitutional question has not been answered
by the respondent.

We, therefore, respectfully submit that

the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for
trial.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES VAN R. SPRINGER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SPRINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

The Court is handicapped in this case, we feel, because

this is here on direct appeal, as the petitioner points up,
altnough he, as I understand it, still makes two claims:

One,

that there was not sufficient objective factual basis for the
18

'i

entry of a judgment on his plea? and two# that before accepting

2

the plea# the Trial Judge did not make an adequate determina­

3

tion as to his subjective understanding of the nature of the

4

charges.
Although the petitioner's case is based on these two

5
6

contentions# we# in fact# have no testimony by the defendant

7

as to whether or not he did understand the charges and not even

3

a factual allegation that he did not understand the charges»

First of all# the nature of the charge itself»

The

indictment which related to tax deficiencies in the one year
of 1960 is simple and straightforward»

It charged that the

defendant willfully and knowingly attempted to evade his taxes
for that year by willfully and knowingly filing a tax return
understating his income by some $13#000# which was somewhat
more than 40 percent of the total alleged income for that year»
Q

Is that what he was convicted of -- $15#000?

A

Yes.

Of course# there was no specific finding.

He pleaded guilty to a deficiency of approximately $13,000»
19

Q

I thought he pleaded guilty to only one of the

three counts and the other two were dismissed?
A

Yes.

1 am sorry.

In that one year of I960 there

was an alleged deficiency of $13?000.

There were somewhat

smaller deficiencies alleged in the years 1959 to 1961.

Those

j

counts were dismissed.
I might point out, however? they were dismissed upon
an understanding expressed by Government counsel? to which
petitioner3s counsel agreed? that the taxes for all three years
would be paid.

From this? I think it is fair to infer that

there was never any dispute as to the actual existence of a
tax deficiency.
Accordingly? the only fact issue in the case was the
issue of the defendant’s intent? whet her he willfully filed a
false tax return.

So there was? we submit? no possibility of

any confusion as to lesser included offenses or anything.

There

was a simple factual question of willfulness.
Q

Had it not been willful? if it had been neglect?

it would have been an included offense? would it not?
A

Mr. Chief Justice? I believe this Court held in

Sansome that all of the criminal tax provisions coalesce? as it
were? in the case where the charge is the filing of a return
that falsely stated income.
Q

If the defendant had misunderstood that word

concerned, it. would have been a minor offense, wouldn't it.?
A

applied.

In fact, I believe there would have been no
None of the criminal provisions would have

Each of the three require willfulness.
Q

Let's put it this ways

Are there any included

offenses in a charge of this kind?
A

No.

In fact, that is, I believe, what this

Court held in the Sansone case.

There are none as to which

instructions are required to be given.

It is either all or

nothing„
Q

The District Attorney does have the right to

charge it either as a misdemeanor or as a felony, does he not?
A

Yes, he does.

But when the charge is made, it

is a single question and there is the one question of willful”
ness.
Before he pleaded, the defendant had, as the record
shows, retained counsel for a period of at least three months.
There was an indication some two weeks before he finally pleader
guilty that petitioner's counsel had led Government counsel to
believe that there would not be a trial of the case.

From this,

we think it is reasonable to infer that there were substantial
discussions about the charges between the defendant and his
counsel, and we find it hard to' believe that those discussions
would not have explored fully the single fact issue in the
case.

Apart from what the merits may be, I suppose the

cation that the plea was not knowing, or, for that matter, that

indicate that he didn't do it»
A

Wo,

We are prepared to 'argue that the contrary

such an inference»
Q

Don't you have to?

A

Yes , we certainly do»

Q

And you are willing to decide this case on the

basis of Rule 11?
A

On the basis of the compliance by the Court with

the real substance of Rule 11, which we feel is that a deter­
mination, at least within the Judge's own mind, be made, and
that there be an adequate basis for that determination»

We

concede, of course, that it would have been better if the Judge
had specifically addressed the defendant as to his understand­
ing of the charges»
Q

As part of foeinf/ the factual basis for the

charge and the plea, I gather that the only issue in the case
was knowing»

Didn't the Judge himself, at the time of sentenc­

ing, make his own finding as to that?
A

In effect, he did that»

Q

He said, "In my opinion, the matter in which the

books were kept is not inadvertent.”

That is pretty close,

isn't it?
A

I would think so.

That plus some of the related

discussions, plus, in fact, what defendant's counsel said at
the sentencing indicate that the Judge

Q

But this is a different matter from satisfying

himself that the defendant himself understood the nature of the
charge and knew what he was pleading guilty to.
A

Yes,

This is really the objective question and

the other is the subjective question as to voluntariness and
so forth»
Q

As I understand, you say that there is enough in

the record to support an inference by us that the Court: did
satisfy this rule.

Did you go farther and do you say that there

was a clear compliance t^ith Rule 11 by the Judge?
A

Mr. Chief Justice, I would suggest that that

perhaps becomes a semantic question.
Q

No, it isn't semantic at all.

It is one thing

to say that there is ehough in the record for us to infer that
perhaps he did know enough about the case to properly sentence
him, and it is another thing to answer whether■ he actually
followed Rule 11 or not, which is the question before us.
A

I have to say that Rule 11 did direct him to

address the defendant and he did not do that.
Q

Do you think it is too much for this Court to

insist that Rule 11 be followed by a District Judge before he
sends a man away to prison for a term of years, when the defendanfc has pled guilty, he saved the State a trial, he is before
him there for anything the Judge wants to do, up to the maximum
punishment that the statute allows?

Do you think it is too much for a Judge to clearly
and distinctly and accurately follow Rule 11?
A

Certainly not* fix’» Chief Justice»

Q

Then why do you support this?

fit of the doubt to the Judge * rather than to the defendant?

on the

whether or not he did* we submit that it would not be prejudicia 1
to the defendant to have a hearing on that issue.
Q

His counsel told the Court that this man* because:

of his drinking* was negligent in doing these things and it was
negligence that brought this around* rather than deliberation.
That didn't prompt the Court to go any farther at all.
A

Those* I believe* are counsel's inferences from

the record* which I believe —

Q

You are getting back to inferences again.

said that to the Court.

It isn't an inference.

He

He said it to

the Court.
A

If the reference is to the statements by the

defendant's counsel at the sentencing hearing, Mr. Chief Justice,
I would suggest that reading those statements as a whole does
not, to ray mind at least, disclose any inconsistencies with
either the existence of a factual basis for the charges or the
defendant8 s understanding.
Q

Now I think we are getting into semantics whan

you refer to it that way.

It is a violation, but reading it,

the effect of it is that it didn't injure the defendant at all.
That is semantics.
A

If it be so, I have to concede that our case

does, to that extent, depend upon that.

We do insist, however,

that the Government should be allowed at least to meet the bur­
den, which we are prepared to accept, of proving on a hearing
that the defendant did plead with an understanding of the
charges against him.
Q

Does the appendix at page 20, page 21 and page

22 correctly set out the conversation that took place between
the Judge and the prisoner?
A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

That, in fact, is a quotation

by the Court of Appeals from the plea record, which is set forth
completely at pages 6 through 8.
27

Q

That is what happened?

Did 1 understand' yea to say a while ago that the Judge
did not directly address the defendant?
Did I understand you to say he did not directly addres
the defendant?
A

No, Mr. Justice.

He did, of course, directly

address him and question hira at some length on other conver­
sations .
Q

They had had some conversation, 1 understand.

A

The subject on which he did not directly address

the defendant, which is raised here, is the question of the
defendant’s understanding of the charges.
Q

But he asked him about several things, whether

he understood them, didn’t he?
A

Yes.

He asked him whether he understood that he

would be depriving himself of a jury trial by pleading guilty?
whether he understood that he would be subjecting himself to a
long sentence? whether he was pleading voluntarily; whether any
promises had been made to him? or whether any threats had been
made to induce the plea.
We do have to concede, though, there was the one
further question which the Judge preferably would have asked,
or perhaps a series of questions.
Q

How would he have asked that, under the rule,

in your judgment?
28

3

A

I think it would not be enough simply to say

"Do you understand the charge?5'
Q

What, in your judgment, did he fail to ask that

he should have asked?
A

I think in this case, because of the simplicity

of the case, because of the simplicity of the charge, it could
have bean a simple question,
Q

What is it you say that he didn't ask that the

rule required him to ask?
A

He did not ask C,D© you understand that in order

to be convicted of this charge you must have willfully filed a
false tax return when stating your income?"
Oa the subjective question, that is the single issue
in this case, whether or not the defendant did understand that
requirement.

As I have said, we believe that the record does

indicate, first, that the Judg e so determined, and second,
that he had a basis for doing so,
Q

Does the rule say that he should ask him if he

willfully committed a crime?
A

Mr, Justice, the rule does say that he shall per­

sonally address the defendant and determine that the plea is
made voluntarily and with an understanding of the nature of the
charge,
Q

And he did answer that voluntarily, didn't he?

A

Yes,

He did not, however, ask him if it was made
29

1

with an understanding of the nature of the charges.

2
3

Q

He asked for three or four understandings, but

he didn5t sweep in the whole things you say,

4

A

Yes.

5

Q

That may be right»

6

A

We have to concede that that is something that

1 am just asking you.

7

the rule directed him to do that he did not do.

&

submit it was harmless.
Q

9
10

However,, we do

I am not drawing issue with you.

I wanted to

see exactly what it was.
A

11

As to the basis for the inference,, which we feel

12

the District Judge properly drew, characterise it as you will,

13

the defendant was a mature roan, a businessman.

14

for some months.

He had had couns ; !

15

Q

What was his business?

16

A

It appears that he was some kind of printing

17

jobber.

At the end of the sentencing proceeding is a reference

18

to a request for a stay of execution of the sentence because he

19

was handling the printing of some ballots for the county at the

20

time.

That is the only indication in the record.
Q

21

22

or two ways.

23

28

You say he could raise this collaterally in one

be raised?

A

On direct appeal?

Q

Why should you contest it, if you say it could
Suppose we decide against you?
30

I understand you to

say he could raise it collaterally*
A

Yes„

Q

So what you want is to show what happened.

A

The problem here is when a defendant has pleaded

guiltys the system is set up in such a way that he should not,
at willt be able to withdraw his plea after he determines what
his sentence will bs„
Q

But if it is shown that there was a mistake and

the Judge left something out, why shouldn't he have a right to
trial, as though he had never made this false step on a plea of
guilty?
A

X would simply urge the obverse of that? that

having pleaded guilty, he should not have the option of undoing
what we believe the record shows was a thoroughly considered,
intelligent act on his part.
Q

The Courts have been very liberal, haven't they,

and have been admonished to be liberal, in connection with
letting people withdraw their pleas of guilty when they have
pleaded guilty and they come up and make what seems to be a
bona fide claim that it was not right?
A

Rule 32 relating to that dees draw a distinction

between the withdrawal of a plea before sentencing which can be
done quite easily, and with the withdrawal of a plea after
sentencing which can only be done after a showing of manifest
injustice.
31

Q

The Court would not want to keep a man imprisoned

if he were not guilty»
A

Of course not, and we would urge that if this

record is not sufficient to support the acceptance of a plea and
the entry of judgment upon it* that those facts should be ex­
plored in a hearing so that we will know whether or not there
is a factual basis»
Q

Is it a matter of a remand?

A

We would suggest that it would be more orderly

if it were done collaterally»

Alternatively* we would suggest

at the very least this case should be disposed of by a remand
for a hearing rather than by a vacation of the judgment with
the option then in the defendant to plead again»
Q

As I understand* you concede that they raise the

question in connection with the Judge, which * if correct* he
wouldn’t have been justified in pleading guilty»
A

It is raised only on appeal* however»

It was

never raised before»
Q

1 thought the lawyer raised it * saying he had

been drinking and that he didn't know»
A

Was that right?

Ho* I think the discussion to which the refer­

ences have bean made were discussions in elaboration of the
defendant’s statement in allocation»

The lawyer was not arguing

that the plea was improper»
Q

What did he say about it?
32

A

About the plea?

Q

About the defendant's knowledge.

A

He said nothing directly about the defendant's

Q

What did he say from which something could be

inferred about his drinking?
A

It is a rather elaborate statement.

Q

Just that part of it.

A

It appears in a number of places in trial coun­

sel's statement seeking to mitigate the sentence.

It refers to

problems that relate to drinking in this case.
"This man has experienced the kind of punishment

„

sell

inflicted*, which is almost a categorical listing of how
ha pleads."
Q

It is a somewhat disjointed

statement.

Was it meant to leave the impression with the

Judge that the man had been drinking to such an extent that he
could not have willfully committed the crime?
A

I think not? speaking very honestly*, after a

reading of the entire record.

In fact,, counsel's principal

point was that the concealments and devious acts which re­
sulted in this tax evasion were carried out for the purpose of
secreting funds*, as I interpret it? so that the defendant could
purchase liquor and so forth without his family knowing about
it.

That was the thrust of counsel's argument*, rather than any?

what I consider to be,, suggestion that? in fact? the defendant
33

was not responsible»
Q

Dicin'3fc counsel say specifically to the Court

that the failure to report this was a matter of negligence on
the part of the

defendant and not intentional, but he realized

that in some circumstances negligence could be equated to that?
A

The word he used, Mr. Chief .Justice, in fact,

was "neglect"»

I would suggest that what he seems to me to have

been meaning by "neglect"1 was the failure to do something, the
failure to report income accurately.

However, this man was an

Q

You mean the counsel was.

A

Yes,

I would suggest that the record does not

support an inference that counsel was confused as to the nature
of the charges.

I think it is important to bear in mind what

counsel's purpose in making these statements was.

Q
case.

I will tell you frankly what concerns me in this

Here we have Rule 11 that is designed by this Court and

by the Congress to eliminate the possibility of an innocent man
pleading guilty and being sentenced to the penitentiary because
he doesn't know what he is pleading guilty to.
You say to us that that remedial statute has not been
34

followed by the Court in this case.

Yet you ask us, by reason

of the totality of the circumstances ? to excuse the Judge from
having done this simple act, and ask us to keep the man in the
penitentiary where a trial of this simple case could have cleared
the matter up entirely.
Are we going to be subjected to that kind of case coming
in here time after time? and this be a precedent for saying?
"Well? the Judge doesn't have to follow section 11 in its en­
tirety? if we can judge from the totality of the facts that
the defendant probably knew what he was doing? then the defen­
dant must stay in the penitentiary.15
Really? this case to me has more significance than
just this defendant.

It is a question of whether we are going

to have to say to the District Judges that they need not follow
specifically Rule 11? which is of no great burden to them but
which is a great fo- cden to the defendant when it comes to
determining the nu ber of years he is going to spend in a peni­
tentiary o
A

Mr. C/ief Justice? I would only say that in this

case? because of the failure to make that simple inquiry at the
plea proceeding? the Government has imposed upon it what may be
a very substantial burden of going through a collateral pro­
ceeding? having to prove that? in fact? there was an understand­
ing of the nature of the charges.
Q

Mr. Springer? that surprises me.

35

Could I ask yc u

to bear with me and let me see if 1 can get this straight in
my own mind?
There are two phases here, chronologically, under
Rule 11o

One, a man pleads guilty in this case»

Then, under

Rule 11, before the Judge at that time, which in this case was
July 15 , 1966 , at that time the Judge may not accept the plea
of guilty without first addressing the defendant, without deter*
mining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of
the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea»
Are you with me?
A

Yes.

Q

On July 15 , the Judge did address this defendant

directly? right?
A

Yes,

Q

He did ask him about his understanding of the

consequences of the plea? right?
A

Yes.

Q

Those were the words added, strangely enough, by

the amendment effective July 1, 1966»

You have stated to us,

however, that he did not address the defendant directly with
respect to the defendant’s understanding of.the nature of the
charge, insofar as the Judge did not ask the defendant whether
he understood that the income tax evasion had to be done know­
ingly in order to constitute the offense charged»
Am I right?
36

A

Yes o

Q

You agree with what1 have said

thus far?

A

He did fail to inquire about that.

Q

And you assert that that question can be attacked

on a collateral basis?
A

Yes , we do*

Q

Is there anyauthority to thateffect?

Remember , we are not talking about whether the prisoner
can collaterally attack his conviction because he did not com­
mit the crime knowingly.

We are talking only about whether the

prisoner can collaterally attack conviction because the Judge
did not determine, by direct questioning., whether the prisoner
understood the nature of the charge.
Is there any authority to the effect that that ques­
tion, that narrow question of what happens after a plea of
guilty and on acceptance of the plea of guilty under Rule 11,
is there any authority that that can be .attacked collaterally?
A

Yes.

There are several Court of Appeals cases.

The question we say that can be raised on collateral
attack is the question of wehther, in fact, the defendant under'
stood the nature of the charge at the time of the plea, not wha
transpired on the record between the Judge and the defendant.
It is the question of actual understanding.
Q

Let3s leave that confusion where it is and Xet9s

go to the next phase.
3^

All right,, that is what happens before the Judge» or
should happen under Rule 11 before the Judge» accepts a plea
of guilty under Rule 11» and those were the events» imperfect
or whatever they may have been» which occurred here on July 15»
1366? right?
A

Yes „

Q

Then you come to the next phase» which is the
!

sentencing*

That is the time at which the last sentence of

Rule 11 applies» is it not?
A

Yes *

Q

And that was September 1966.

Rule 11» as amended

effective July 1» states that the Court shall not enter a judg­
ment upon the plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there
is a factual basis for the plea.
Do you want to tell this Court» or do you want to make
any comment to this Court» as to whether that sentence was satis­
fied in this case» remembering it does not have to be satisfied
on July 15 if what I have said is correct» but it does have to
be satisfied by the time the judgment is entered» which in this
case was September?
In the colloquy in September» according to this record
the Judge did refer to what he referred to as more or less
deliberately confused bookkeeping of the defendant as disclosed
by the presentence report? is that right?

Q

So that there is soma indication hare that the

Judge did have before him some information going to what actually

„

happened here going to the factual basis for the plea? is that
right?
A

Yes.

Q

Is it the Government’s position that that is

essential^ that it is essential to comply with that last sen­
tence

f

that there be some indication of some sort on the record

that the Court did look into and was satisfied that there was
a factual basis for th© plea# or do you say that that last sen­
tence doesn’t mean anything of the sort?
A
record»

I think there should be some indication in the

I think it was sufficiant here without even some of the

colloquy.
Q

You think there should be some indication# but

that the indication here is enough?
A

The crucial point being it was indicated that

the Judge considered a presentence report.
Q

And you say that the Court doesn’t have to enter

anything on the record to the effect that it is satisfied that
there was a factual basis for the plea?
A

No.

We would suggest that is sufficiently im­

plicit in the entry of judgment.
Q

There was nothing on the record in this case to

that effect.
39

I
A

No.

The Judge did not say,; "1 am satisfied.'”

However P we would suggest that the language in the last sentence
of Rule 11 was chosen advisedly.

It contemplates an informal

determination by the use of the word "satisfied" and that re­
quirement was fulfilled here.
Q

Is the presentence report made available to the

defendant and his counsel?
A

Under a contemporaneous amendment to Rule 32a,

the Trial Judge is told that he may make the presentence report
available.

It was not, requested.
Q

In this case?

A

No.

Here it was not made available to the defen­

dant and not requested.
Q

How do you know from what the Judge said that he

actually got that* even from the presentence report which was nc t
available to the defendant?

Might he have gotten it from dis­

cussion with the District Attorney or with somebody else?
A

That certainly is not concluded.

Q

It certainly doesn't show that he got it in any

legal way, does it, what he said?
A

No.

We would suggest, however, that it should

not be required to satisfy the last sentence of Rule 11 that the
record support with appropriate evidence the determination of
"satisfy" that the Trial Judge makes,
Q

What is there in this record to support the

statement that the Judge is satisfied with the fact that he
didn't properly keep his books, but kept them intentionally
wrong?

What is there in the record that we can review to sup­

port that conviction on the part of the Judge?
A

There is very little, we have to.admit*

Q

There is nothing? isn't that correct?

A

There is nothing in the ordinary sense of evi­

dence? yes*
Q

All right.

Honor, counsel for the respondent has brought up one tiling which
wa argued in our brief and which counsel for respondent has
never answered*
He said that an accord of sorts was reached, that
Government counsel indicated to the Judge when he appeared ex

not go to trial, according to counsel for the defendant*

Later

on, the District Court was informed that there was an under­
standing that the tax and penalties would be paid*
If this is true, and we have argued if this is true,
is this not another urgency for inquiry, that a man who has, to
the knowledge of the District Court, been hospitalized for

41

is

alcoholism

who could not stand trial two weeks before he

entered his plea of guilty because of illness — is it not sig­
|

nificant that the Government now argues that there might have
been some accord?
1 think that this is another point indicating that
there was a need for the District Court to inquire into this
matter,, and that this should not have been left unnoticed.
Lastly, 1 would like to point out that the finding
which the Court has made in this case* at page 8 of the appen­
dix „ is not that there is any determination on the defendant's
understanding.

The finding that the Court makes is that the

defendant was advised of the consequences.
There clearly in the record is no finding at all that
there was any informing of the defendant as to the nature of the
charge.

There is nothing in the record to indicate whether or

not the defendant actually did understand the charge„ and the
statements in the record which give soma evidence on this matter
are inconsistent with an understanding of a plea of guilty to
a charge of a crime which requires the specific intent for its
fruition,
I think in the allocution that the very first matter
that came to the Judge in the allocution was the defendant's
statement "If it were not for my health and the things I have
gone throughg it never would have happened, and it was not
deliberate and I am sorry,"
42

That is almost verbatim what he said»

I think when

you have a specific intent crime, a statement such as s,lt is
not eeliberate," a vague and amorphous statement of that nature j
.

requires inquiry.
If it is what counsel for respondent calls an act
of attrition, it certainly is not an admission of guilt.

At no

point in this record is there an admission ofguilt, an admission
of understanding, an admission that the mental state necessary
to the crime was ever present,,
Now counsel wants us to go back to the District Court
and to go through one of the procedures which he suggests, one
of which would require that the defendant be in custody? the
other procedure requiring that the defendant bear the burden of
proving his innocence.
We feel that the constitutional issue in this has never
been answered and that counsel has made no attempt to answer it.
Q

I notice in the last sentence of your brief you

ask that the case be reversed and, accordingly, remanded for
further proceedings in conformity with law.

What proceedings?

A

A tria3 on the merits, Your Honor,

Q

A trial.on the merits?

A

Yes.

Q

That is what you mean by further proceedings?

A

Yes.

Q

Do you mean you foreclose the possibility of
43

another plea of guilty?

He may not,, but I take it if he wanted

to, you donet foreclose that possibility, do you?
A

I certainly donsfc foreclose the possibility of

entering a guilty plea.

That is a bz'idge 1 have not come to yet.

But it seems to me that with the evidence in the record„ a plea
of guilty would not be made.
Q

But you do not. ask for anything more than to

give the man a trial?
A

Yes, Your Honor? that is right.

(Whereupon, at 11s30 a.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
