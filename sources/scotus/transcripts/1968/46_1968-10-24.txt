ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. MELVIN L. WULF

0

FOR PETITIONER

9

MR. WULF:

\

1
Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.»

10

This case is here on Certiorari from the United States Court of

11

Appeals from the 10th Circuit which affirmed decision of the

12

District Court of the District of Wyoming dismissing

13

petitioner's complaint.

.

14

The facts are these.

Petitioner, as a duly enrolled student preparing for

15

the ministry at a recognized theological and divinity school

16

had been classified pursuant to the Military Selective Service

17

Act and the regulations in class 4d by his local board in 1966.

18

Class 4D entitles him to be exempt, not from registration but

19

from training and service.

20

j

On October 16, 1967* the petitioner returned his

Z%

registration certificate to the government, "solely for the

ZZ

purpose of registering his dissent from participation by the
I

23
24
25

United States In the war In Vietnam."
The reasons supporting his dissent' were contained in
an affidavit filed with the complaint.
3

He said he had turned

1

in his card as an act of collective conscience in support

2

of our dying and suffering brothers who are presently fighting

3

on our behalf :Ln Vietnam and as a responsible expression of

4

concerned citizens acting in light of the First Amendment.

5

He stated his belief that the Vietnam situation
\

6

reveals this war to be in violation of most of the criteria of

?

The Just Wars Doctrine and is a major threat to security and

&

the peace of the world.

9

Upon receipt of his registration certificate, his

10

local board on November 7, about two weeks after he had turned

11

in his card, mailed him a delinquency notice, a standard

12

Selective Service form, notifying him that he had become de­

13

linquent for two reasons.

14

One, for failure to have his registration certificate

15

in his possession, and two, for failure to advise the board of

16

his current status.

17

At the same time, simultaneously, a notice of

18

classification was sent to the petitioner advising him that he

19

had been re-classified 1A.
i

\
•;

20

The petitioner appealed to the State Appeal Board

21

which affirmed his 1A classification on December 27 and on the

22

same day the local board sent him a notice to report for in­

23

duction on January 2*1, 1968.

24
25

i

*

Suit was filed or January 19 in the District of
Wyoming to enjoin the induction and to require petitioner’s

b
s

1

re-classification back into 4D, the exempt 3tatus.

2

of January the District Court granted the government's motion

3

to dismiss from the bench.

4

Tenth Circuit which affirmed the decision below on February 21,

5

and this decision for Certiorari was granted in May.

The questions in this ease are all of first impression-

7

For the first time since the adoption of the conscription in

3

19*10 and after some dozens of millions have been conscripted

0

during the first quarter of the century, this case brings to

W

the attention of this Court some of the low visablllfcy machin­

II

ery of the Selective Service System.

12

the Selective Service System is of course controlled by the

13

design of the regulations.

14

The actual operation of

We believe that this case will reveal that the

IS

regulations involved in this case do not turn square constitu­

16

tional corners.

17

Also involved in this case in the high disability of

13

the Director of Selective Service.

IS

ment has agreed that General Hershey effectively invited the

20

local boards around the country to use the the Selective Service

21

System as a means to punish dissidents from national policy and

22

he thereby not only punished some dissidents from national

23

policy for expressing their political views but he also de­

24

terred many unknown numbers from expressing any views at all.

23

We contend and the govern­

i

The threshold argument in this case, before we get

5

I
I

I

to the merits, involves Section 10 (b)(3) of the Military

z

Selective Service Act of 1967, a new provision adopted by

3

Congress in 196?.

4

of the classification or processing of any registrant by local

5

boards and appeal boards or the President except as a defense to

6

a criminal prosecution instituted under Section 12 of this title

7

after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or neg­

8

atively to an order to report for induction, "
The government, the Solicitor General, has agreed with!

It reads, "No judicial review shall be made

9
10

us that in the circumstances of this case the revocation of

11

petitioner’s Md classification was without authority because it

12

was contrary to an express grant of the exemption by statute

13

by Congress, and that for that reason the District Court should 1

I

have granted the injunction and required petitioner's classifi- I
14
15
16

cation back into 4d.
We agree with the Solicitor General but we think the

17

Solicitor General’s concession is too narrow.

18

court a rather broader interpretation of 10(b)(3) to one often

19

described as the special circumstances exception, a doctrine

20

applied to the statute, which, have purported either to deny

21

review entirely or to limit it in one way or another.

22
23
24
25

We urge upon the

The "special circumstances" doctrine in this case we
contend, and I will come back to it in more detail in a moment,
is that the local board acted beyond Its jurisdiction in
depriving petition of his *SD exemption and that to not allow

6

*

i

petitloner to sue, to regain his exempt classification will

2

needlessly expose himself to prosecution.
The second and slightly broader ground on which we

3
4

would have this court base its decision in reversing the court

5

below is that the whole schemes all of the events surrounding

6

the withdrawal of petitioner's classifications violated the

7

First Amendment, and in that respect we rely on the case of

8

Wolff v. Selective Service decided by the Second Circuit in 196?’.
We think that the court, without getting to the eon-

9
10

sittutional issue concerning 10(b)(3), can decide the case on

11

either of those two grounds.

12

should the court disagree with us that this is a"special cir­

13

cumstances" case, or take the position that the First Amend­

14

ment was not breached in this case, then we say that it is

15

necessary to examine the constitutionality of 10 (b)(3) itself

16

which seems to require that the only way petitioner could test

17

the validity of the withdrawal of his exemption is to refuse to

18

report for induction and to defend in a criminal prosecution.

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Q,

However, we also argue that

What was the law prior to 10(b)(3)?

V/hat was the

statute prior to 10, or wasn't there any?
L

10(b)(3) before the amendment said only that decisions

of the local board shall be final, which was the statute as in­
terpreted in Falbo v. Estep. There was no statute like the new
amendment prior to its adoption.
The justification that the Selective Service System

7

1

has put forth in this case in objecting to any pre-induction

2

litigation is what they describe as the litigious interruption

3

of the functioning of the Selective Service System.

4

interruptions of functioning of Selective Service System was

S

put forward 25 years ago in Palbo where the question was whether

6

a registrant could raise questions about the validity of a

?

classificiation in defense of a criminal prosecution.
Mr. Justice Murphy, in dissenting in Estep, said of

8
9

Litigious

the government's position there that it is alleged that to allow

10

a full hearing in a criminal proceeding under this act would be

U

to extend an open invitiation to all inductees to disobey their

12

induction orders and litigate the validity of the orders in a

13

subsequent trials.

14

stripping petitioners of their right and process and thought it

'15

was a speculative concern at best.
Palbo specifically said that the question there was

16
17

10
10

20
21

He described it as a poor excuse for

to be decided in the context of a wartime situation where the
nation's manpower was fully mobilized.

That was also the back-

\

i

ground of the Estep case where, as I say, the only question was
whether Selective Service registrants could raise their objectioris
in a criminal prosecution.

Bothof those cases arose in a war-

'

i

22
23
24
25

time situation where the nation was fully mobilized and where
its very life was at stake.
The situation is entirely different today, where there ;
is no declared war and the nation's life is not in the same

8

1
2

I

degree of jeopardy as it was during the Second World War.
Judge Zirpoll, in the Northern District of California
who in an opinion striking down 10(b)(3) on the ground that it

3

i 4

is unconstitutional, also addressed himself to the government's

5

claim about litigious interruption, and he said the interruptioni

6

was insignificant if it existed at all.

7

He said "it would not disrupt the Selective Service

8

System because the court would indeed experience a net saving

9

in time because the need for a few trials would be obviated by

10

voluntary compliance with orders which have been judicially de­

n

clared valid and some time will be saved the trial because the

12

issue of the orders' validity probably might have to be

13

litigated.51

14

The Selective Service System also says in its portion

15

of the government’s brief that pre-induction suits will in­

16

terrupt Selective Service because they are generally filed

17

within a few days of the induction date.

18

That happens to be true in the ease before you.

It

10

doesn't happen to be true in the general run of cases in which

20

affirmative suits which I know about, amounting to about 20,

21

have been filed.

I 22
23
24
.25

Most of those suits were filed after re­

classification and before exhaustion of the administrative appeal s
process, during which time an induction order cannot issue.
The Solicitor General also says, as one of the
government's reasons for opposing pre-induction review of these

9

<»

j

cases , that if petitioner’s induction is enjoined someone else

2

will have to take his place.

3

As to that, I would just like to point out to the

4

court that in the semi-annual report of the Selective Service,

5

which the Solicitor General filed with the court yesterday, at

6

page 13, the fact of the matter is that should petitioner's

7

induction be enjoined it really would not affect the Selective

8

Service System at all because in every year since 19^9, In the

Q

table at the bottom of page 13, the Selective Service System

10
11

is overbooked.
In 196?, for example, the Defense Department asked

12

that they induct 288,000 men.

13

ducted 298,000, which is indeed 10,000 more than the Defense

14

Department had requested.

IS

j

They called 3^5,000.

They in­

I also want to say something about habeas corpus as

1G

an alternative and alternate route to criminal prosecution.

We

17

don't think that habeas is really an effective alternate be­

18

cause it requires that the man go into service and perhaps, in

19

compliance with an allegedly invalid order, It requires that he

20

be subject to military law during the time he is in service and

21

during the time that his habeas is pending.

22

induction he may be transferred a long distance from his home,

23

which generally would be the case, away from his friends, away

24

from the witnesses, away from the local board, away from all of

25

the people who could testify in his behalf which would in fact

j

10

It may be that after

make it very difficult for him to bring an effective habeas
corpus.
Also the habeas appeal, during the course of a habeas
appeals he would have to be subject to all of his military
duties as contrasted to the appeal in the courts of a criminal
prosecution or a civil proceeding where he would not be subject
to military duties.
The special circumstances in this case are set.

These

are the circumstances which we urge upon the court as a reason
and basis for granting pre-induction judicial review, in those
cases where the board has acted without power, where it has
acted beyond its jurisdiction.
There are seven such special circumstances.
One, that the board acted contrary to the statutory
exemption.
Two, that the board’s declaration of the petitioner
as a delinquent, his re-classification and induction were un­
authorised by the statute.
Three, that that procedure was unauthorized by the
regulations.
Four, that it was unconstitutional because it sub­
jected petitioner to punishment.
Five, that the delinquency regulations are unconstitu­
tional.
Six, that turning in the registration certificate is

11

?

protected by the First Amendment,

2

Lastly3 there is a fact of independent requirement of

3

possession,

4

Q,

S
6

What are the special circumstances?

Where does it

come from?
A,

It comes from a fairly long line of cases s Justice

7

Harlan —* hlpke v, Lederer in the twenties, which was a tax

8

case which used the expression ''special circumstances.
There are other cases during the 19205 s

9

Miller v.

10

Standard Nut Margarine and other cases cited on page 38 of our

11

brief.

12

More recently the doctrine if not the actual language

13

has been used in Leedom v. Kyne and the National Labor Relations

14

Board case, Harmon v. Brucker, question of the quality of dis­

IS

charge given to a member of the Armed Forces, and in a number

16

of immigration and naturalisation cases, Shaughnessey v. Pedreire»

17

Brownell v. WeShung, and Rusk v, Corfc.
All of those cases, and I would like to talk just for

19

a moment about Leedom v. Kyne, and McCulloch v, Sociedad which

20

are labor relations cases, both of those cases allowed affirma­

21

tive suits to be brought to test the jurisdiction of the Nationa

22

Labor Relations Act provided that review could be secured only

23

by re\Jiew of a certification order or on review of an unfair

24

labor practice claimed by the court.

25

initiate in the Circuit Court.

12

Those would, of course,

4* 4»

13

?

However, in these two eases, in Leedom, where the

2

board acted in flat contradiction to a statutory provision,

3

this court allowed an affirmative suit to be brought into

4

District Court, and the same in the McCulloch case where this

S

court said that the question there involved international re-

«5

percussions because it dealt

7

Labor Relations Board to certify foreign flag seamen sailing on

8

foreign flag vessels.

9

is one that has been applied by this court not infrequently in

10

the face of statutory language which would seem to either deny

with the power of the National

So the "special circumstance" doctrine

11

District Court Jurisdiction or to limit it in one way or another

12

We also rely on the second ground on which we urge the

13
14
15

1G
17
18
19

court to permit in the circumstances of this case pre-induction
judicial review, because of the compelling First Amendment cir­
cumstances in which it arose.

In those circumstances we think

that the decision in the Wolff

Selective Service decided in

an opinion written by Judge Medina in 196? is the view that
should be followed by this court.
Q

That was just a pure protest case, was it not?

It did

20

not have the additional element of divesting himself of his

21

classification card.

22
23
24

25

A,

It was a protest that took place inside the office of j

the office of the local Selective Service Board, yes.
Q,

But it was not the alleged violation of a statutory

duty to remain in possession of the card.

13

j

1

A.

¥ells the local board thought so.

The Selective

i
2

Service System thought so.

The Second Circuit thought not.
5

3

Q.

It was just a straight protests a demonstration.

4

A

It was a dual holding actually.

5

What the Second

Circuit said, as I read the case, was:

6

One5 that the local board did not have jurisdiction fcoj

7

re-classify the registrants involved in that case for, in effect,

8

the alleged commission of a crime.
Secondly, it also pointed out that if re-elassificatiop

9
10

for engaging in protests of any kind were permitted this would

11

not only offend the First Amendment rights of the particular

12

registrants involved, but would also deter their expression of

13

First Amendment rights by other registrants who ivould not be

14

able to discern the contours of what protected speech would be

IS

in the

IS

Selective Service context.
We think that this i3 precisely the case here.

We

17

think that petitioner’s turning in his card was an act protected

18

by the First Amendment and that as such it comes within

19

scope of the Wolff case.

20

the

We also believe that 10(b)(3), if applied in this

21

case so as to cut off petitioner’s right to pre-induction re­

22

view, would be unconstitutional.

23

court has to get to that.

24

it in detail in the brief and I would rather go on to the de­

23

linquency regulations which underlie this entire case.

I do not think that the

There is no requirement that they do it.

15

i

is overbroad in the protest First Amendment sense.

kinds of activity that subjected registrants to delinquency de­

Another was declared delinquent for counseling evasion

of the Selective Service Law.
Another was declared delinquent for being a member of
the Students for Democratic Society.
Another man, who recently came to my attention., and I

15

sent a copy of this to the Solicitor General by mail, out of

16

Colorado, has been declared delinquent because "of your activity

17

18

Any regulation, no less any statute which can be in­

19

terpreted and applied against undoubted First Amendment pro­

20

tected activity of this kind, is in our view unconstitutional

21

under the First Amendment.

22

We attack the delinquency regulation not only for-

23

being in violation of the First Amendment, but also because they

24

are not authorized by the statute because, as used in this case,

25

they are not authorized by the regulations themselves, or mfchdF

nothing to do with the discreet information-gathering function

necessary for classification which it is the purpose of the

delinquency regulation to enforce,

Lastly, we say that as applied in this case, and in

17

general, the delinquency regulations are unconstitutional because-

18

what they do in effect is to punish the registrants by threaten­

ing to Induct them if they do not coincide with the "duties” of

20

the Selective Service law and its regulations.

I am afraid I have run out of time.

I do want to

save a few minutes for rebuttal.
We have other arguments relating to the First Amend­

view the most important aspect of this is the invalid

It Involves only a question

10

In the same statute enacted at different times.

11

are some constitutional questions in the offing to which Mr. Wul f

12

has alluded, I do not believe that they need be decided here.

13

Although there

The case comes here on an extremely short record,

14

consisting of nothing but the complaint filed in the District

15

Court, an affidavit of the plaintiff filed in the District

16

Court, the exact status of which here I do not know, and the

17

government’s motion to dismiss the complaint based primarily on

18

the provisions enacted by Congress in 1967 as Section 10(b)(3)

19

of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967.

20

This is not the kind of a record, it seems to me, on

21

which important and difficult constitutional questions should

22

be decided.

23

As far as the petitioner’s delinquency classification

24

is concerned we know virtually nothing in the way of facts since

Of course3 the government waived this by filing its

motion to dismiss, but the fact remains this is now a bare-bones

3

case at best.
As a matter of fact, there is a way in which it is

5

possible to treat the case as an easy one, as was done by the

6

two courts below, and by the representatives of the government

in presenting the case there.

Perhaps that is the way it should

Section 10(b)(3) is simple and clear on its face.

9

It

10

says that no judicial review shall be made of the classification

^i

or processing of any registrant except as a defense to a crimin­

12

al prosecution after the registrant has responded either

13

affirmatively or negatively to an order for induction.
There is no criminal prosecution here, so the statute

14
15

says there shall be no judicial review.
Congress surely has considerable latitude in 3uch

16
17
18

matters.
Apart from special circumstances which may be present

19

in this particular case, there is a good deal of basis to support,

20

such a conclusion, and this is in fact developed at some length

21

in the first point in our brief at pages 15 through 35.

22

vailing arguments are developed in the petitioner's brief.

Counter­

23

I should like to make it plain that we do not regard

24

Section 10(b)(3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967

25

as invalid on its face or anything like that.

19

Where there are

1

no other factors involved, we are prepared to advance the prop­

2

osition that it is valid.

There is a case now pending before the court on

on appea.1 from the United States District Court for the

6

Northern District of California, in San Francisco, where one of

is unconstitutional.

Actually there is a division on this question among
the District Judges in San Francisco.

Some have held that

Section 10 (b)(3) is unconstitutional and others have held
that it is valid and have given it effect.
We have taken a direct appeal in the Gabriel case
where the decision went against constitutionality in order to
get that question resolved.
I state this situation in order to make it plain
that it is not the government's position here that Section 10
(b)(3) is invalid in the general case.
The problem arises here because of special circum­
stances which may be relevant inthis case.
When we take another look at Section 10(b)(3) its

22

clarity becomes less evident.

23

the statutory provision as it appears on page 3 of the govern­

24

Just what does that mean?

How can there he a

history, and it is suggested that this is to leave open the

8

availability of the writ of habeas corpus after a registrant

9

has accepted induction into the array.

For this we are referred to the legislative

But that surely is not

10

judicial review "In defense to a criminal prosecution."

Ob­

11

viously the statute means more or less than it says on its face,

12

or at least something different from what it says on its face.

13

We are thus confronted with the problem of statutory

14

construction, dealing with a statutory provision of sweep and

IB

generality, without explicit qualities or qualifications, but

IS

subject to one qualification which is accepted by all concerned,

17

that is, that in addition to criminal prosecution there can also

Id

19

be judicial review in habeas corpus.
i

It should also be observed that this is a statute

20

which is a part of a comprehensive statutory provision, much of

2!

which has been In effect for a long time, and different parts

23

of which have been enacted at different times, sometimes perhaps

23

without full attention being paid to the articulation of the

24

several statutory provisions.

25

I

As Mr. Wulf has pointed out, when one seeks to apply
21

I

Section 10(b)(3) to certain types of cases, constitutional

2.

questions loom over the norlzen.

3

First, we have those which are based on the First Amendment,

4

sometimes referred to as First Amendment overtones; and, second,

5

those which are based on the Fifth and the Sixth Amendments.
Such questions arise, perhaps, most clearly, whereas

6
7

here the so-called delinquency regulations are involved.
For reasons which I will develop a little later I do

8

9

These are of two sorts:

not think it is necessary to argue the old question of the

10

validity and the effect of the delinquency regulations in this

ri

case.
It can be said, though,that the delinquency regulation?

!2
13
14

are not as clear as they might be.
It

should be observed In the first place that they are

15

entirely a matter of regulation.

There is no affirmative grant

16

of power by Congress to deal in this way with delinquents except

17

that it can be said that the regulations have, in a way, been

18

ratified by Congress, by a provision first appearing in the

19

1967 amendments relating to the order in which registrants are

20

to be inducted, putting delinquents into the top priority.
But there is at no place any definition of de­

.21

22

linquency.

23

others which are more serious.

24

There is nothing in the statute or the regulations
i
which spells out which is which. Whether a person Is in fact

25

Obviously there are defaults which are trivial and

22
!

I

to be declared a delinquent is left to the unfettered judgment

2

of the local board, guided to some extent by general statements

3

of the Selective Service System.
Then as Mr. Wulf has pointed out, there is a further

4

■

S

provision in Section 1624.4 of the regulations which provides

6

that a registrant who has been declared to be a delinquent may

7

be removed from that status at any time, and a similar provision

8

in Section 1642.14.
In either case, though, is there any standard.

9

There

10

is no provision that the board must give the registrant an

11

opportunity to correct his delinquency, no definition as to

12.

what actions will be sufficient to life the delinquency classi­

13

fication.

14

the registrant from delinquency status.

the board.
Whether this would be a sufficient standard in the
case of delegations to other types of administrative agencies

18

I do not know.

19

Selective Service System need not, in my view be decided here.

20

Whether it Is enough in the case of the

The eventual problem of the validity of the delin­

21

quency regulations is furthur complicated by their essentially

22

punitive nature.

23

It is said they provide a sanction which is analagous

24

to civil contempt.

If that were the correct analogy, though,

25

the delinquency would be removed whenever the registrant brought
23

1

himself into compliance and he would have to be given an

2

opportunity to do so.

3

At this point we encountered General Hershey’s

4

letter and memorandum which are printed in the Appendix to the

5

petitioner's brief.

6

If this is a penalty3 or if it is being used in a

7

punitive fashion, we have the multiple problems that there was

8

no indictment by a grand jury, no right to counsel, no trial by

Q

jury and indeed no trial.

10

Perhaps there are answers to all of these questions,

11

They can be considered in another ease when that becomes

12

necessary, and hopefully on a record which will contain more

13

facts than are available here.

14

Although these questions need not be considered here

15

the fact that we come close to them is, it seems to me, quite

16

relevant in considering the question of statutory construction

17

on which, in my view, the case can be determined.

18

One of the important statutory provisions in this

19

case, of course, is Section 10(b) (3) s expressing the will of

20

Congress that there should not be litigious interruption of the

21

Selective Service process.

22

Section 10(b)(3) is clear, specific, and unqualified.

23

I have already pointed out that both courts below felt that it

24

was sufficient to dispose of the case after urging by govern­

25

ment counsel to do so.

j

i

But there is also another section in the same statute.

2

It was enacted at a different time, and it expresses a policy

3

which has been in all of our Selective Service acts for more

4

than 50 years at least.

;>

on pages 3 and 4 of our brief.

This is Section 6(g) of the act, quoted

Under this provision, "ministers of religion and

6
7

students preparing for the ministry, who are satisfactorily

8

pursuing full time course of instruction in recognized theo-

9

logical or divinity schools, shall be exempt from training and
service under this title."

10

1?

There are no exceptions or qualifications.

"Such

12

students shall be exempt from training and service under this

13

title by act of Congress."
There is nothing about an exception for delinquency

14
15

or anything else.

Congress clearly intended that such students

IS

should be exempt as long as they maintained themselves as full­

17

time students in good standing at recognized theological schools
In this case the petitioner specifically alleged that

18
19

he is such a student.

This is in paragraph 5 of his complaint,

20

on page 3 of the Appendix.

21

the government admitted the accuracy of this allegation.

By filing its motion to dismiss,

Of course, if the case is remanded for trial this will

be the subject of proof along with the other allegations of the

complaint.

It is perfectly possible to say that Section 10(b)(3)

defense to a criminal prosecution, and to await that event for

the application of the equally unqualified Section 6(g).

8

satisfactory.

this act is clear.

would be the duty of the Attorney General, responding to the

Congressional mandate, to refuse to prosecute the petitioner,

12

And if the Attorney General did seek and obtain an

13

indictment It would be the duty of the District Court, or any

15

appellate court, to dismiss the prosecution.

under the act to violate the act or any of the regulations.

It is a regulation which requires

petitioner could not be prosecuted for the crime of violating

arguments which can be made about the validity and effect of

18

Q

Surely, I understand that.
But you nevertheless say that the procedural provision

19
20

in the statute is applicable to one and not to the other, that

21

is to say that judicial review cannot be obtained except in

A.

Because one comes within the terms of the statute

5

Q,

Yesj but the next question is this: does that affect

the jurisdictional or procedural provisions of the statute

administrative remedies or whatever?

But in effect this petitioner, because he is a

15

ministerial student in your submission, can bring an action to

16

challenge, let us say, the validity of the regulation requiring

17

him to have in his possession the registration certificate.

18

A,

Wo, Mr. Justice.

Perhaps it is a quibble, but what

19

I suggest he can do is to challenge the order to report for

20

induction, which is what he has done by this suit.

21

22

Q,

;

But he could not challenge the regulations requiring

him to be in possession of his registration certificate?

23

A.

I think not —

24

Q

Would you make clear what is bothering me, Mr. Solicit ?r

25

General?
28

J

A,

Yes.

I think he could not simply enjoin his prosecu­

2

tion for a crime, which is what the other actions would be,

3

whereas it seems to me that the combination of Section 6(g)

4

with Section 10(b)(3) can best be resolved by saying he is free

to raise the question whether he can. be validly ordered to

factors involved here, including the constitutional doubts

25

that might be raised here both under the First Amendment and

I

under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments with respect to delinquency
re-classification, the two statutory provisions can best be
reconciled in my submission by giving effect to the exemptions
contained in Section 6(g) and holding; that Section 10(b)(3)
must yield in the light of the facts of this case.
I should make it plain that it is the position of the
Selective Service system, in essence, that it is Section 6(g)
which must yield in the adjustment of these two statutory
provisions.
I have tried to summarize the arguments to this effect
in the final portion of the government’s brief, and I know that
the court will give this its careful consideration.
I have also asked that there be distributed to each
member of the court a copy of the semi-annual report of the
Director of Selective Service for the six months ending
December 31s 1967.
This includes on pages 10 and 11 a statement by the
director about delinquencies and also on pages 21 to 23 a
summary of the director’s views, particularly with, respect to
the letter which he issued to all local boards in October, 196?'.
For what it is worth, my own conclusion is, as I have
indicated, that the clear and unqualified provision for ex­
emption in Section 6(g) should be given effect here, thus
making it unnecessary to consider other questions, including
constitutional questions which have been argued by the

30

?

petitioner, and which may come up for decision in some later

2

case which does not involve an exemption provision such as

3

Congress has provided here.

4

Q

I suppose that if you regard the 1967 Congressional

5

reference to delinquency as a ratification of the delinquency

6

procedure you might have to acknowledge that it was a ratifi­

7

cation of the delinquency procedure across the board, that is

3

to say, as applied to ministerial students and ministers as

3

well as other persons.

10

A.

That is a possible construction.

1 find it very

11

difficult to find any trace of any suggestion or evidence that

12

Congress contemplated when it put that one word in the pro­

13

vision of the statute referring to delinquents that it was

14

thereby repealing the exemption for ministers —■

15

I am not talking about that.

Congress knew from

16

these reports, I suppose, it was certainly a matter of public

17

knowledge and general knowledge in 1967, that ministers of the

18

gospel had been classified as delinquent by Selective Service

19

boards, and then in 1967 it did include the word "delinquency"

20

in its enactment,.
I thought I heard you at the beginning of your argu­

21

22

ment refer to the possible argument that that constituted a

23

ratification of the delinquency procedure.

24
25

A.

That, Mr. Justice, is certainly a possible argument.

To me it is just too slender a reed to stand on in this

31

'i

particular case In view of the clear language of 6(g) and its

2

long continued historical background.

O

Here In this particular case we find it difficult to

kJ

4

see why the court should reach a construction of which,

5

the court's words in Estep requires the courts to march up the

6

hill when it is apparent from the beginning that they will have

**TT

/

to march down again —- because even in the case you mention,

8

Mr. Justice, when you get to the point of prosecution it will,

9

I submit, while 6(g) remains on the book, remain the duty of

to use

10

the Attorney General not to prosecute and of the courts to

11

dismiss a prosecution if one is begun.

This is under 6(g).

12

Accordingly we submit that the judgment

13

be reversed and the case remanded to the District

14
