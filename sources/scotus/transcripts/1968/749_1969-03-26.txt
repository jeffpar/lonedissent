ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM ROSS WALLACE, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
This is a case that comes up on the petition under

10

11

Section 2255,

12

improperly denied his right of appeal.

15

IS

did not speak the language well.
through an interpretor.

21

22
23

25

The trial was conducted

At the conclusion of the trial and

after the time of sentence the prisoner alleged that he requested
the interpretor to ask the court and to ask his counsel to
arrange for his appeal.
He also alleges that his counsel agreed to do so.

19
20

Federal prisoner who claims that he was

His petition alleges that he is of Mexican descent,

13
14

a "

And that an oral notice of appeal, if there is such a thing,
was given but no written notice conforming to the statute
was filed.
The prisoner originally and within six or seven weeks
after the time of sentence filed what I suppose you would call
an application for a late appeal.
2

]

That was denied by Judge McBride, the District Judge

2

in Sacx'amento and by the Circuit Court of the Ninth Circuit,,

3

upon the grounds that under the rule of the Ninth Circuit an

4

application for a right of appeal, late, where a prisoner

5

claimed that he had been denied that right of appeal must also

6

show some basis for the appeal»

7

In other words, it must show not only that he was

8

deprived of that constitutional right but he must show that he

9

had something upon which some reasonable basis upon which to

10

11
12
13

appeal»
The proceedings were in 1963.

In 1966 the prisoner

then filed an application under Section 2255 and that applica­
tion ivas very much more detailed than the previous ones.

Ha

14

had apparently risen in the hierarchy of the jail and had been

15

there long enough to learn a little more English and that was

16

a better job than the first one.

17

There again and without hearing, without reference to

18

the transcript, without reference to his counsel and without

19

reference to the United States Attorney, Judge McBridge denied

20

that application and again he then filed his motion to have

2!

the appeal heard in forma pauperis in the Court of Appeals for

22

the Ninth Circuit.

23

The court again without hearing denied that motion,

24

again on the basis of the rule in the Ninth Circuit that in

25

addition to showing the deprivation of the right to appeal a
3

1

prisoner must show something more at least must show the basis

2

of an appeal.
The cases in California in our Circuit are not

3
4

wholly clear whether he has to show conclusively or whether
!

5

the Judge here talked about rights constitutional or otherwise

6

but in any event it is clear that in our circuit different from

7

most of the circuits a prisoner claiming his deprivation of

0

his right to appeal must show that he* if granted that right* ha

9

at least a reasonable basis upon appeal.
Now in the application for the motion for the writ

10

11

of certiorari the prisoner set forth these facts.

12

General in his opposition felt that a prisoner should at least

13

show something that would indicate some basis for an appeal.

14

In our opening brief I pointed out that here was a

The Solicitor

15

prisoner of Mexican descent having very little knowledge of the

16

language.

17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

!

He was tried with four or five other people* at

least two or three of whom had separate counsel.

The whole

proceeding was conducted through an interpretor.
And how in heaven's name a person under those cir~
©instances would be able to recognize and remember what errors
occurred at the trial that might give him some, basis for an
appeal seemed to me an impossibility.
I think in the Solicitor's brief they have in effectwaived that point.

They seem not to rely any further upon the

basis that something should be done that the prisoner must show
4

1
1

1

something beside the actual deprivation of his right of appeal.
The brief of the Solicitor of the United States in

2
3

this case seems to have waived that point and be really talking

4

about whether this prisoner should now have a hearing, or

5

whether this Court should send this matter back to the District

6

Court to permit the District Court to interrogate and take

7

affidavits from the trial lawyer that this man had or whether

8

he has to bring the prisoner down from McNeill's Island.
We are talking now I think only of mechanics.

9

My

10

own view of the matter and I think I can express it easily is

11

that if we take the rule of the Boruff case which as described

12

in Hannigan simply says a prisoner who is deprived of his

13

right of appeal or a prisoner’s right of appeal with the ten

14

day period during which that right must be exercised does not

15

16

commence to run until such period as the prisoner is effectively
represented by counsel.
Now, after our original brief I obtained from the

17
18
19

20
21

court reporter in Sacramento the*, transcript of the last day of
the trial.

which this prisoner was sentenced, this prisoner and the
others„
Oddly enough that transcript shows no oral notice

22
23
24
25

That is to say, the transcript of the day upon

of appeal.

Although the lower court and the Circuit Court in

our circuit had both said it was there.

In other words, we have

a judicial finding based on no fact whatever, an obvious result
5

1

of not even looking at the transcripto
However, the transcript does contain a very much more

2
3

important -— on page 3 of the appendix to my reply brief —

4

the counsel then makes the motion not in very good language but

5

he. said it is just proceeding in forma pauperis in behalf of

6

Adolpho Rodriquez and Etta Rodriquez while they are before the

7

court, hereafter if they are transported away we would have to

8

have them returned to make a motion before the court»
Judge McBride then says no, I don’t wish to take up

9
10

that motion at this time.

11

taken all morning on it.

12

and all motions have to be in writing»

15

18

19
20
21

I have no idea what your motion is

who had been retained by Rodriquez and his wife for the trial
was advising the court that he was stepping out.
You know the only purpose in making a motion of that

16

17

We have

Well, it was clear at that moment that the counsel

13
14

It is 5 minutes after 12»

sort is to indicate to the court that he was through, that
lawyer was finished, and the motion to proceed in forma
pauperis could only mean that he was in effect suggesting to
the court that he was through, the court should appoint a new
counsel and permit the man to appeal.
Section 37(a), Rule 37(a) says very clearly that if

22

i
|
i

23
£4
25

a prisoner is not represented by counsel, then the court must
advise him of his right to appeal and the Clerk must enter the
notice.
6

Now it would have been perfectly simple to have

1

2

accomplished that purpose at that time»

Now we are five or

3

six years later, yes, six years later.

4

for six years.

S

basis of the transcript the court can well now state that the

6

prisoner's right to appeal commences at such time as the court

1

in Sacramento appoints for him counsel and permits him then

S

to enter his appeal.

He has been in jail

It seems to me perfectly clear that on the

Now I think there is no point in my discussing the

9
10

rule in the Ninth Circuit where I think because of their desire

11

in the circuit and a very proper one to prevent repetitious

12

applications under Section 2255 they laid out a lot of rules.

13

I think the lower courts misunderstood the Dodd case somewhat.
But in any event while I can only agree with the

14

IS

courts in their desire to prevent to the extent they can,

16

repetitious petitions under Section 2255, that has nothing to

17
18

do with the right of a prisoner to be secure in his right of
appeal.
\

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Now this is not a case that can easily arise again.
Because as your Honors well know, under the change of rule, no
matter whether the prisoner is represented or not any longer
the courts all now advise him of his right of appeal and if
counsel is not going to take it the court simply instructs the
clerk to enter the order.
So that we are talking about a situation that
f

7

1

certainly is not on® to plague us in the future.

This is a

2 1 simple situation of a man having very little knowledge of the
3

language whose trial counsel was not willing apparently to

4

proceed past the trial who attempted to make clear to the

5

Trial Court that he was withdrawing and whose failure and I

6

think it a very serious failure on the part of the counsel was

7

that he failed to file the proper motion.

did nothing further,
Q

What would the motion have been?

A

X think it would have been a motion, your

Honor, to permit the prisoner to proceed in forma pauperis on
the appeal it would have meant I think also the appointment by
the court of counsel for the prisoner.
Q

The difficulty I have is that reading Roman III

of the appendix to your reply brief, there is no real indi­
cation there of any wish to appeal, of any desire or purpose
or wish to appeal.
A

That I agree, your Honor.

I think we have this

odd situation.
The first time this came up Judge McBride said in
his first opinion that the prisoner claimed that he had mad®
an oral notice of appeal.
The case then went up before Judge Chambers and
Judge Bone in the Circuit and somehow or another Judge Bone,
8
\

1

I think, wrote the opinion»

2

notice of appeal, oral notice of appeal, was given by retained

3

counsel.

5

That was the basis of that,
Q

4

Judge Bone said the right that

You don't read the record as supporting that

statement, do you?

1 don't,

6

A

I don't read this record as supporting it, no,

7

Q

That is what I mean,

A

No,

It goes back on up to the

on the panel, they then affirm again that this oral notice
was given,
I can find no oral notice.
On the other hand, I can understand perfectly well
that a Mexican prisoner would think that this motion that the
man was making under this forma pauperis motion was just that
and obviously it was intended as that,
Q

How do we know that?

A

It could have no other purpose, your Honor,

20

2?
22

The prisoner to appear in forma pauperis if he is
just going to the jail house, there is no purpose of his having
the motion made except to have counsel appointed for him so

23
he could appeal.
24

If he had no other purpose.

has got his 20 years in the Federal prison.
25

9

Otherwise he

It seems to be one of the clearest cases that I know

i
2

of of a failure for whatever reason of counsel to protect the

3

right of the client to appeal.
Now I can understand Judge McBride, it had been a

4

S

long 5 or 6 week's trial, conducted through an interpretor

6

and a lot of lawyers and he was a little weary, I guess,

7

himself and shut the man off before he had completed his motion,
Now that does not excuse counsel — he is retained

8
9
10

counsel — for not completing that motion and making it in
writing and making it wholly clear.
On the other hand, it would seem to me an extraordinary

11

12
13
14

15
18
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

thing for a court to hold that the prisoner clearly wanted to
appeal — he has alleged in all his papers that he wanted to
appeal.

There has been no denial on the part of anybody that

he wanted to appeal.
He was denied his right of appeal, not on this basis,
of this motion because nobody had ever even seen it.

But

denied it only on the basis that even assuming he wanted his
right of appeal and that it should be given to him he must
show in addition to that a basis upon which an appeal might ba
successful.
In other words, in our circuit they have confused
the constitutional rights provision under Section 2255 with
the right of direct appeal.

They have taken the right of

direct appeal if it is late and added to it a demand that a
25

10

i

prisoner be able to show, not only that he was improperly

2

denied of his right of appeal but that having been so denied

3

he still .has valid grounds for an appeal.

4

Now, of course, that is a wholly impossible task

5

for a prisoner in this situation who obviously has no knowledge

S

of law, for him now to try six years later and recall what

7

happened in the trial and what the trial errors were, it is

8

perfectly impossible.

9
10
11

12

13
14

IS
16
17

18
19
20

It seems to me perfectly clear that this prisoner
should be granted a hearing.
a hearing is necessary.

1 don’t know that even granting

But at least that I would think would

be the minimum that the prisoner can have a hearing, his
counsel can be brought in and it can be established, the facts •
can be established, the record is available, the transcript —
the notes at least -— are available and the United States
Attorney is available, Mr. MineHi, his counsel is available.
The case I think is one that illustrates better than
most the difficulties that arise, when these matters are handled
in the lower courts without reference to counsel and without
reference even to the transcript.
Because obviously her® we have gotten off on the

2!
basis of somebody's recollection when five minute’s work in

22
reading the transcript and a few minutes in calling Mr. Minelli
23
would have established that what Mr. Minelli was saying was I
24
have represented the prisoner at the trial, I am not going to
25

11

1

represent him further and I ask the Court to appoint counsel

2

to do so.

3
4

Q

Is there any indication at this pointy what,

if anything, he would be able to present on appeal?

5

A

I have no idea»

6

I can say wholly ex parte, your Honor, simply from

7

discussing this matter over the telephone with Mr. MineHi,

8

I tried to get him two or three times»

9

lawyer and I was never able t© make an appointment»

10
11
12

13
14

15
16

17
18

19
20
21
22

He is a very busy trial
He told

me that he thought he had at least one valid ground of appeal»
But that this had been a long trial. He felt he had
not been compensated as he should have been and that he was not |
going to take the thing up on appeal.

That he told the prisoner

he would not take it up on appeal for him but that he would
arrange it»
Well, the prisoner, you recall in his petition said
this lawyer said he would arrange it.

Well, the arranging it

was this forma pauperis business but he failed to do it.
So I think we have got a clear case where the
prisoner was improperly deprived of his right, the right is
an absolute right that in the absence of the prisoner
knowledgeably waiving or giving up that right, there is not
any indication here that this prisoner gave up any right to

23
appeal knottingly.

There is every indication from the fact

24
that the prisoner started within six weeks, & few days after the

25
12

j

■

1

30 days went by he was writing out the first somewhat feeble

2

attempt to get himself an appeal.

3

So it is clear that he wanted one.

It is clear from

4

my going through the records and my discussion with Mr. Minelli

5

that the prisoner and his wife wanted to appeal.

6

Q

What has happened to the petitioner's wife?

7

A

The petitioner asked me, wrote to me and asked

8

me if I could find out where his wife was.

He has not been

9

able to communicate with her I think he said since 1943 or 44.

10

Q

She was convicted?

11

A

She was convicted.

12

Q

I see.

13

A

And sent to Terminal Island Prison, X think, in

14
15

Southern California.
He asked me if I would write to her brother and 1

18

did and X received no reply.

X have not tried to communicate

17

with her in the Federal prison if she is still there.

IS

Q

She, too, seems to have been -—-

19

A

Yes.

20

But he has no knowledge of where she presently is

21

22
23

and she may for all X know still be in the prison in California.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEATRICE ROSENBERG

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

3

MISS ROSENBERGs

4

There really is a very narrow, almost no disagreement

5

May it please the Court,

between petitioner and the Government in this case.
The cases are quite clear and quite general through­

6

7

out the court that there are two situations which do call for

8

some relief on bi-collateral remedy where prisoner claims

9

that he has been denied the right of appeal.
One is where

10

his counsel has not told him anything

11

about his rights of appeal and has abandoned him and the other

12

.is if counsel has been guilty of what the court sometimes call

13

broad but if you look at the case is a matter to overreach it.
There doesn’t seem to be any conflict on the propo­

14

15

sition that if a counsel assures the defendant that he will

16

take care of his appeal and then deliberately does nothing,

n

not just sit, the fact that this is a basis for collateral

18

19

relief.
Where the Ninth Circuit and possibly two other

20

circuits although their decisions are not wholly clear have

21

been different where there has been a conflict is on the

22
23
24
25

question of whether in addition to alleging a deprivation of
the right to appeal the prisoner has to show that there was
some basis of appeal.
And the Ninth Circuit is the one that insisted on
14

1

this requirement»

2

which was try to sift the wheat, the good case from the bad

3

one and we assume that if a man had a good point on appeal

.4
5
6

We understand what they were trying to do

it would take a vote to his contention that counsel deliber­
ately didn't do it.
However, on reflection we have come to the conclusion

1

that we can’t support that as a requirement for requiring

8

action in the District Court and the reason for that is that

9

it seems to us not wholly consonant with the real remedy that

10

you are trying to get at, what collateral relief was primarily

n

and originally designed to do was to take care of the person

12

who got caught in the coils of the law either the judge or

13
14

15
16
17
18
18

20
21

22
23
24

the prosecution or his own attorney»
tod it seems to us that those who are most likely to
abuse, that really kind of make up stories that we do encounter
could meet the Ninth Circuit requirement with no difficulty.
But the truly honest, ignorant person who had been overreached
by an unscrupulous lawyer v/ould find it most difficult to
specify whether there was legal error at his trial and for
that reason w® do not urge the Ninth Circuit rule.
But since the case is here we do think there are
some things this court could help clarify with respect to
this kind of a claim or perhaps even more generally with respect
to this question of what does a judge do when he gets an
allegation of this kind.

25

15

I think no one who has had experience with them can

i

2

fail to appreciate the fact that a lot of these are simply

3

not true and the res\slfc of wishful thinking.

4

On the other hand, there are some that are.

5

We have agreed that if what this petitioner alleges

6

in his petition for a writ of certiorari which is much more

7

detailed and much more specific than his allegations in the

8

District Court, we have agreed that if what he alleges in the

9

petition for certiorari were alleged to the District Court

10

the District Court would have to do something.
We find it a little difficult to fault the District

11
12
13
14
15
16
17

Court on not acting on what. it. had before it.

assuming — it is true that the District Court rested on the
Ninth Circuit rule which we are not defending but even on
the petition of the District Court it seems to us the petition
is not specific enough as the petition for certiorari is
to require action and we think that is different.
We think you have a right to require specific alle- —

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

But even

gations in the District Court about what went on with his
lawyer.

We can't expect an ignorant prisoner to know where

this legal error at a trial but he can know what went on with
his lawyer.
Now, in the petition, he alleges something which is
fairly consistent %?ith what petitioner’s counsel says.
has discovered ex parte.

He

He says that he asked the attorney
16

1

to appeal»

Petitioner’s trial counsel gave oral notice of

2

appeal»

3

be an oral notice of appeal.

I assume he considered this rather cryptic motion to

4

Then he says petitioner's wife was then placed in a

5

room to await transportation back to the county jail and that

6

one of his other papers in the record says he was held in the

7

oarnty jail for 30 days.

8

were waiting petitioner's trial counsel came to see petitioner

9

a nd his wife and told him he would arrange for the cases to

10

be appealed.
Now that is the part that we don’t know what happened

11
12

1-3
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

But at this point he says, v/hile they

then.

That is after this hearing, whatever went on there.

And whether it is true or not I have no way of knowing.
But we agree that if that allegation if counsel said
he would arrange for their cases to be appealed, which appears
only in the petition for certiorari, it may to the District
Court call for some action.
But the question is, what action.
And I think that this is important not only in this
situation which we hope will arise rarely in view of the new
rules but even more basically generally in 2255 when you get
allegations often made out of whole cloth what is a judge to
do and it seems to me that this court decisions in both
Walker against Johnston in 312 United States and in Machibroda
have been misunderstood»
17

In both of those cases there were responsive affi-

1

2

davits filed and the court held on the basis of those responsive

3

affidavits where one side said "X" and the other said exactly

4

the opposite that the Court could not decide the matter on

5

affidavits that there had to be a hearing.

the court said as I read both of those cases is these affi­

it has to be a formal responsive pleading like the old return

what you do want is to get something in the record which seems

Why?

Because we don’t have to have a

We just go ahead with an appeal if that is the

situation.
On the other hand, we had a case, I think this term,
maybe last, in which a prisoner alleged that his attorney had
deliberately failed to go ahead with his appeal and the
attorney had filed in court a written consent signed by the
prisoner to dismiss the appeal.
I think experienced attorneys faced with charges

2255, and if it is decided that he does have a right of appeal
you give him a lawyer on appeal.
There is no question that if the appeal is allowed
he is given a lawyer.

The question is, can't we get a re­

sponsive pleading which at least serves the function of
narrowing the issues and which may even avoid the necessity
of a hearing before we have to give him a lawyer,
Q

My problem is if I understand you correctly

that in this very case once this petitioner had a lawyer the
lawyer was able to say it properly so that you admit that if
that had been filed in the District Court it would have had
to have been heard.
Doesn't that mean that when he gets

back to the

District Court he has to have a lawyer?
A

Your Honor, he didn't have a lawyer except a

prison lawyer and I guess a pretty good one in this case.
The allegations that we consider sufficient are the

makes here are the kind that a prisoner can make, particularly
in the light of this Court's decision in Johnson against Avery

This is

simply asking him to say what happened between him and his
lawyer.
Now all we said was, if this same kind of an alle­
gation, just copy, were put to fch District Court the District
Court would have to do something.

We admit that.

The question is, what does the District Court do
with that point?

We say the first thing the District Court

does before it appoints a lawyer or before it decides to
hold a hearing is to ask for a responsive pleading from the

22
parson that knows.

Q

Vacate the sentence I suppose so

~

m

A

Well, there are two different ways of doing it

11

and I think the one that your Honor suggests is a better one.

12

It is a way suggested by the District of Columbia . and by

13

the Eighth Circuit, I believe, which is to vacate the sentence

14

and resentence so that the 10 days for appeal starts to run,

15

and, of course, at that point he has to appoint a lawyer for

16

him.

17

I think that is a better way.

And it had problems

18

before because there would have been problems of credit on

19

sentence, but in view of the new statute which gives a prisoner:

20

credit on a sentence for

21

22

offense, these problems would not arise and it seems to me more
expeditious and correct to have the sentence vacated and the
appeal proceed in that situation»

X don't know, your Honor.

determination, counsel has said to a prisoner, I do not think
there is anything to be gained by appeal.

has nothing been said like that her®.

We don’t know what has been said, your Honor.

We know what the prisoner has said.
Q

X don’t know what happened.

What is the exact disposition that you think

1 think the proper is for this Court to rule

the allegations in his petition can be sent back to consider

whether the allegations in the petition for a writ of certiorari

cases where prisoners have said counsel refused to take an

19

document which the prisoner has signed agreeing to dismiss

26

the appeal.

21

I don't think, it is unfortunate 1 think that this

case has taken so long.

23

attempts weren't considered more carefully.

that counsel was derelict without knowing the facts.

Are you suggesting that there should be a

Yes.

9

Q

And depending on that, whether there would be

19

a hearing or not?

Is that it?

11

A

That is right.

12

That is our position now.

The reason I hesitated

13

when you first asked me is we suggested in our brief that what

14

was said in the District Court was so unspecific compared to

15

what is said in the petition for certiorari that it would be

16

appropriate to just let him start all over again.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

However,, I don't think that is terribly important.
He has made these very specific allegations and in light of
the fact that counsel is convinced that they have a basis in
this case, then I think that it could well be a remand to
consider this.
But I do think that we cannot in a sense convict
counsel without giving him a chance to say what his version
of the everafc is.
Q

Bo we have to convict counsel
28

or do we have

to interpret what he said to the court and determine how the

said that except for the fact that he didn't delineate what
his Causa of appeal was that he couldn't appeal.
That is the issue they decided.

Not that he didn't

give an oral notice of appeal, but that he didn't give the
reasons why he was appealing.

And they say because of that

and because of our rule he can't have an appeal.
Now, why can't we say if you don’t abide by that
Ninth Circuit rule, Miss Rosenberg, why can’t we say that the

accusing- —

10

Q

I beg your pardon?

11

A

I think that we are accusing counsel of a dere­

12

liction of duty without hearing counsel.
Now, I agree that the indication in this particular

13
14

case are, that this man should be given a right of appeal

15

except that one of the things that is surprising on the other

16

hand I must say is that there were other defendants represented

17

by other counsel, separate counsel.
Now I am going to believe one may have not understood

22

his obligations completely,

I find it hard to believe that I

think it is four different counsel,

I am not sure.

Didn't do

so.
However, I think that we have rules here that must
be applied across the board.

And we cannot fail to face the

fact that there are many prisoners who simply create stories
out of whole cloth that sound very convincing and turn out not
31

to be, to be absolutely false on documentary evidence.

18

that does counsel's duty extend to carrying through to the point

19

of at least notifying of a right of appeal and what he should

20

do and particularly when it is retained counsel, does counsel

21

have a right —

22

Q

a deprivation of a right to counsel?

Q

No, X think the only difference is the situation

22

of a retained counsel saying to the defendant whom he does not

know to still have funds, I think you have a good ease on appeal

24

but I won't do it unless you pay me $5,000,

34

about the rights to proceed in forma pauperis.

so, are they both under the same standard?
A

Yes „

Q

And so your line, the Department of Justice

suggests to the court in all of these cases where there is
failure of counsel to take some step which he had neither agreed
to do or the client expected him to do that we ought to draw
a line between the negligence and the deliberateness?
A

Yes.

And pure negligence you would say that whether

the counsel is retained or not or appointed the client is
stuck with his counsel?
A

That is right.
35

1

Q

Miss Rosenberg, isn’t the real question here

2

whether there was, whether the prisoner deliberately gave up

3

his right to appeal?

4

deliberate failure to appeal,

5

(a) by proof of a decision on the client part or the acquies­

0

cence of the lawyer’s decision.

7

That is to say, whether there was a
tod that can foe established

On the other hand, if the lawyer fails for whatever

a

reason to advise the client of his right of appeal, then at

3

least arguably there was

110

111

no waiver or voluntary surrender of

■he..right of appeal.
And all of these are questions for the District Court

112

to look into and decide in this case once we — if we do get

113

past the obstacle presented by the Ninth Circuit’s ruling in

114

this case that since the petitioner failed to state a basis of

115

his appeal it will not consider the appeal.

Have I summed it up correctly?

Mr. Wallace, have you

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. WALLACE, ESQ.

211

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

212

MR, WALLACE;

213

I should like to address myself first to the question

214

215

I think I can finish very shortly.

asked by Mr. Justice Marshall.
I think it is obvious in a situation of this kind
36

1

that immediately on remand counsel must he appointed for the

2

prisoner»

former lawyer and asking him to make an affidavit ex parte

5

that in this case already.

6

I don’t think the court should be calling in a

I think the ex parte business * we have had too much of

I think if counsel had been called in in the first

7

instance, and the United States Attorney called in in the first

8

instance We wouldn't be here.

110

II?

Q

Well, is there a constitutional right to a

lawyer in 2255?
A

In the Boruff case in the Fifth Circuit the

112

Court says we think it is not an unwarranted construction of

113

the Rule 37(a)(2) to construe the words defendant not repre­

114

sented by counsel to mean a defendant not represented by

115

counsel during the 10-day period after which failure to file

11G

a notice of appeal would forever bar such a right.

t!7

Q

Well, at least, I suppose if this court ruled

118

that there should be a hearing the practice in the Ninth

119

Circuit would be to appoint counsel?

20

A

I would think so, yes, your Honor.

21

Q

They do appoint counsel

22

A

That is correct, your Honor»

2>3

Q

Mr, Wallace, you are not suggesting are you

24
25

when they have hearings?

that this court should tell the District Court at this stage
how to go about ascertaining the resolution of the issue of
37

1

face if one develops?

2

A

No, 1 am suggesting this court should not do so,

3

Q

We should not, and you are not suggesting, are

4

you, that at this point we should instruct the District Court

3

that it should or should not appoint counsel for the ascertain-

3

raent or whether this petitioner's lawyer did or did not advise

7

him about his right to appeal, did or did not fail to perfect

3

the appeal?

9

A

Well, I would assume, your Honor, if this case

10

were sent back to the District Court and the rule of the Ninth

11

Circuit is overruled by this court and this case is remanded

12

to the District Court to determine whether this prisoner has

13

a right of appeal, all of these things will be taken care of,

Q

Then the District Court will go ahead and take

care of its own.
A

The thing I was objecting to was that some kind

of a proceeding happened before the court held a hearing.

I

think the prisoner is entitled to be present or at least
entitled to have counsel and then the Court can go on and
have whatever kind of an investigatory hearing it wants.
So long as it is confined only the question of this
man's right of appeal and not to the question of whether his
appeal is granted would be a good one.

I donst think that is

any business of the District Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARRENs
38

Before you sit down, I

1

just want to say to you that the Court is conscious of the fact

2

that you are representing this indigent defendant by assignment

3

from us and we consider that a real public service on the part

4

of the lawyers to do that and we always appreciate it and we

5

appreciate your services in this case.

MR. WALLACE:

I thank you# your Honor.

It has been
