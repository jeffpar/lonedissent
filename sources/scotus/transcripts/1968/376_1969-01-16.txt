ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. EDWARD THORNTON, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. THORNTON:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court.
V"'

to

In the beginning the city of Mobile decided to exclude

11

the taxpayer from its business of selling 59 cent baby pictures

12

in Mobile by imposing a license that was applied exclusively to

13

the taxpayer in the amount of $50 a day.

14

The taxpayer had been in the State of Alabama for

15

about three years operating in eight cities advertising its

16

existence, but it was not until after this proceeding began that

17

the State of Alabama discovered the taxpayer and assessed a

18

transient photographer3s license on the taxpayer, not only for

19

the current year but for as many years back cis they could go.

20

This assessment was made in the State Department of

21

Revenue and we appeared in protest of that assessment making

22

substantially the same arguments that we are making in this

23

court today but unsuccessfully.

24
25

We appealed to the Circuit Court of Montgomery County
where we made substantially the same arguments that we are
2

1

making here today and unsuccessfully.

i

Supreme Court of Alabama making substantially the same argument

3

and again unsuccessfully»

4

In fact, this sort of gets to a man's ego \altimately»

5

So we are here today on this case where the facts are sub­

0

stantially these:

Q

--

May I ask you please, what court did you say you

filed the suit in?

9

A

10

Department of Revenue»

11

Q

You mean in Montgomery?

12

A

That is correct.

13

We appealed than from that assessment to the Circuit

14

Court of Montgomery County and from there to the Supreme Court

15

Of Alabama.

10

The assessment was made against us by the State

The facts are that the taxpayer has been engaged in

17

business of taking baby pictures for some while and it has a

18

good many experts who are very good at posing children and has

IS

done quite well at it.

20
21

22

!

We then appealed to the

They have agreed with the J. C. Penney Company to
conduct their operations in and through the J. C. Penney stores.
The operation is that the local manager of the Penney

23

stores decides when they would like to have the photographer

24

from taxpayer.

25

The advertising, direct mail and other advertising is
3

j

i

1

furnished to Penney by taxpayer and then the photographer goes

2

in at the given time, has sittings, poses the children, exposes

3

the film, sends the exposed film back to the offices of taxpayer

4

which are in Charlotte, North Carolina, and then moves on.

5

is, the photographer moves on.

8

The exposed film is developed in North Carolina.

That

The

7

pictures are printed and finished and then forwarded back to the

S

J. C. Penney store, the local store where they are delivered to

9

the customer.

10

Now had the State of Alabama imposed a license on all

11

of these operations; that is, had the State of Alabama imposed

12

a license on all non-resident photographers coming into the

13

state and holding themselves out as photographers, having

14

sittings, posing children, exposing film and then forwarding

15

the film out of state to be developed, printed and finished, and

18

then the finished product to be returned to the State of

17

Alabama, had Alabama had a license in those words, I take it

18

even the Attorney General of Alabama and even the Supreme Court

19

of Alabama would not have contended that that would meet an

20

attack under the Commerce Clause.

21

;

I take it that if we begin to take variables off one

22

at a time — for example, instead of saying ail non-resident

23

photographers, suppose the legislature

24

who hold themselves out as photographers, take sittings and such

25

I take it that the Attorney General would not claim that such a

4

had said all photographer :s

1

license could be imposed on tills taxpayer, and on down to the

2

present place where the present license in Alabama which says on

3

transient photographers a license of X dollars.

Why v/ouldn't he be here, 1 wonder, if it applied

equally to residence as well as non-residence?

The operation that they would be engaged in is

one that is clearly an interstate activity.

10

We start with a

We expose the film in Alabama.

We

Now if the license included all of those things, this

11

would clearly be attempting or an attempt on the part of the

12

state to license that which it can't license.

13
|

Q

14

IS

We have the right to do this under -the Federal
Constitution.
Q

The State of Alabama doesn't give us that right.
But I understood you to say that if they had

16

imposed this tax on all itinerant, photographers, whether they

17

were in or out of the state, that the Attorney General would not

18

be here to defend them.

19

A

I doubt very seriously if he would.

20

Q

Well, now, just what is the defect in that, if

21

they treat all of that class of photographers alike in a non-

22

discriminatory way?

23

A

This would be an effort to attempt to use a

24

license which would be a license, a non-discriminatory license,

25

on photographers.

All photographers shall pay a license.

But

5
I

1

the application of that license, albeit, a non-discriminafcory

2

license, on this interstate activity x^ould in our judgment run

3

afoul of the Commerce Clause.

4

And the State of Alabama has not made that contention.

5

What they have contended is this:

6

of events beginning with the non-resident photographer, exposing

7

film in the state, sending it back to North Carolina for

8

developing and then sending the picture back," they don’t claim

9

the right to tax all of those activities; that is, both the

10

They say, "Take this series

in-state activities and the out-of-state activities.

u

They don't claim that.

32

They say, "But what we can do is," and this is why we

13

are here today, they say, "We can take this series of events

34

and chop them up in pieces and we can catch the local activities

15

and v/e can license them."

16
17
18
19

20
21

And this is why we are here today,

because we say they cannot do that.
You see, this is a unitary transaction.
Q

Yes, I understand that.

But I am just trying to

get straightened out.
Suppose that instead of sending these pictures to
North Carolina, they sent them from Montgomery to Mobile and at

.

22
23
24
25

the same kind of an operation.

Would there be anything wrong

with that tax?
A

Well, if the operation was entirely in Alabama,

that is, if this was not a non-resident photographer — of
6

I

coursef this takes one of the issues, that is to say, the

2

developing of the film and keeps that in the State.

3

would do, that would give them a little more local activity to

4

in effect hang their hat on.

5

Q

Would that be all right?

6

A

I would not say so.

If that

I would say that if they

7

applied that to a non-resident photographer who is traveling

8

about over the country -—

9

Q

No, we are talking about the state.

They take

10

the pictures in Montgomery and they process them in Mobile.

11

you think there would be anything wrong with this tax as applied

12

to that situation?

13
14

A

On the statement that you have made, the answer

is no, I see no objection to it.

15

Q

16

Now, do they apply —■ does the State apply this tax

A

I cannot answer that.

Q

Do you mean there are no photographers in Mobile

No, I can’t say that.

Q

Well, they are taxed, too, aren't they?

Our

Aren't

local photographers taxed but taxed differently?
A

Yes.

Well, a local photographer that has an

office there and operates at a fixed location is the magic word
in Alabama.
If a photographer is at a fixed location in Alabama,
does pay a license, yes.
Q

But your point is that the transient is charged

14

more and your second point is that because he is a transient,

15

he can't be charged at all?

16

A

That is correct.

17

The reason the transient — we say that the transient

18

shouldn’t be charged at all is because of what the State is

19

attempting to do.

20

to be this unitary transaction and split it up in parts and

21

aPPlY the tax to that part.

They are attempting to take what vre conceive

22

Now with reference to photographers in the State, you

see, the license on a photography shop at a fixed location is a

Now a prior case in Alabama involving Olan Mills —

4
5

they had what they called branch operations which was operations

6

at a specific branch in Alabama and they insisted that they had

7

a right to not to be taxed as a transient because that license

8

is $5 a week.
The license at a fixed location .is $25 a year.

9

And

10

so Olan Mills said "You can't charge us a transient license

11

because we are doing business at a fixed location." The Supreme

12

Court of Alabama said as appears in a quotation in our brief on

13

page 27, the statement that by sending the exposed film outside

14

the state, this made the operation a transient operation.

15

therefore, the transient license would apply even though the

!6

film was exposed at a fixed location.

made against us for operations in Birmingham, had ws been —

1

had we taken out a license at a fixed location in Birmingham,

8

for the 2-1/2 years involved in this case, the license would

9

have been $62.50.

10

As a matter of fact, by reason of charging us $5 a

ii

week for operations at Birmingham, it turned out to be $110.

12

Now we say this makes it

13

against it because of inter-state activity.
Q

14

15

discriminatory and discriminatory

Suppose the tax were exactly the same as the tax

on photographers who have a fixed location?
A

16

Well, then we would be relegated to our first

17

point which is, that a unitary transaction of this kixid cannot

18

be broken up into parts to license part of an inter-state

19

activity.

20

Q

Do we have two questions before us?

21

If we should decide that this is not a violation of

22

the Commerce Clause because of an improper regulation of Inter­

23

state Commerce or an improper burden on the Interstate Commerce,

i 24
25

then if we should decide that, then are you suggesting that we
must go on and decide whether this discrimination standing alone
10

1

makes the tax unconstitutional?

z

A

No, sir.

3

0

That is a State question, is that what you are

5

A

Largely.

S

We are anxious to have the Court hold that this

4 isaying?

7

unitary transaction as I so described it, that the effort on

8

the part of the Stats to break that .into parts and license the

9

local part of it, this should destroy this tax.
And if the Court comes to that conclusion, my case is

10
11
12

through.
I threw the other two in hare because I didn't come up

13

here for an academic session.

14

And if I lose it on that ground, I want the Court to know that

15

this case may well also fall afoul — in fact, I think it does

16

fall afoul of the Opelika case which is the flat license, the

17

flat ungraduated license theory which when applied as an ad­

18

mission to Interstate activity is bad.

19

I came here to win a lawsuit.

We say that is No. 2.

But, of course, we concede that if we win only on

20

that point, the State can beat us because they will then

21

graduate the license.

22

So, with No. 3, if we win only on the ground as

23

applied to this case, it was discriminatory because of the

24

Interstate activity, and that if instead of our sending the

25

exposed film out of the State, we kept the exposed film in the
11

1
2

State, they will get us again there.
So, the last two points will arise, we hope, only if

3

Point No. 1 is not reached.

4

reached and we think this completes the case.

5

But we think Point No. 1 should be !

We have the photography cases set out on pages 15 and

6

16 of our brief.

7

8

derogatory sense — but I mean this isxa't the first effort that

9

a State has made to tax such activities there.

30

This isn't the first time that a State has

And interestingly enough, Alabama, was one of the

33

culprits there, too, Dozier against Alabama, and there was one

12

against North Carolina.

13

There the local activity which the State sought to

14

impose the license on had to do with frames.

15

said that if anyone who sells a frame in the State where the

36

picture was developed somewhere else, if you sell a frame,

17

picture frame in there, this is subject to a license.

One of them was

This court held in the North Carolina case that this

19

is what I suggest is the case here.

20

license on one of those parts which could not stand.

22

Alabama case, Dozier against Alabama is the same case.

This was a splitting up of

cases with this difference:

interstate activity throughout.

5

It seems to me that the complicating factor here

6

is that this could he regarded as the J. C. Penney operation.

7

J. C. Penney rounds up the children and does the selling and

8

delivers the photographs after they are made as I recall the

9

facts here.

10

A

That is correct.

11

Q

find in that sense it is different from the

12

typical Drummer case?

13

A

That is true.

14

Q

And then you have these out-of-state photographers

15

who come in and expose the film and send the film out of state

16

to be developed, and then the photographs are sent back to J. C.

17

Penney so you have a situation here that is a little compli­

18

cated in the intermingling of intra and inter-state aspects,

19

a little more of a mingle than some of the others on our books.

20

A

That is true.

21

Of course, response No. 1, this case doesn't involve

22

J. C. Penney as the court is aware.

23

against us.

24

State was very anxious to see to it that no agency was developed

25

between Penney and taxpayer.

And in the appendix it is pretty clear that the

a difference between itinerant and fixed location photographers.

25

We raise no point on that.

Q

Well, then, why would you say that — aren’t you

is really a license on Interstate Commerce because it isn't

discriminatory without reason anyway, is it?

of all.

That that

Well, this is, of course, the point we want most

But if I may, on page 27 in the brief, the reason they
'

7

held, the Supreme Court of Alabama held, the reason they held

8

that we were subject to a transient or an itinerant license

9

was because it says this, "True, in the branch operation," —

'IO

this had to do with Olan Mils case, page 27 —■ "there is a fixed

11

location»

12

processed and the pictures are ultimately made in Chattanooga."

13

But it sends its films back to Chattanooga to be

Now on this basis, you see, it was because this

14

Interstate activity that the transient $5 a week license is

15

imposed rather than the $25 a year license.

16

a direct discrimination against Interstate activity.

17

Now we say this is

Now as to the equal protection clause, as to the state

18

making a difference between itinerant photographers and the

19

resident photographers, we make no point on that.

Have I made myself reasonably clear?

21

I will reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

23

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. BURTON, ESQ.

24

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

25

MS. BURTON:

Mr. Burton?

Gentlemen, in the first instance here,
18

T

it seems that the appellant rather acuses the State of Alabama

2

and the city of Mobile of entering into some kind of evil

3

conspiracy to put this company out of business.

4

But actually, the tax levied by the State has nothing

5

whatsoever to do with the tax levied by the city.

They are two

S

separate and distinct entities and there is no evidence in the

7

record that there was any kind of collusion or conspiracy here

8

between the State and the city.
If it is any feel where there is a confusion, and it

9
10

is in this field of Interstate Commerce and as I read the cases,

11

if there is one universal principle that applies to all cases,

12

it is that each case 3tands on its own shoes or on its own facts.
Mow in this particular case, not in this case but in

13
14

similar cases where the State has assessed this license tax

15

against photographers operating for Olan Mills, the Supreme

16

Court of Alabama on not one but on three occasions has held that

17

this tax is directed at the photographer and the individual

18

photographer.
That is, the person who comes in and takes the picture.

19
20

And we disagree with counsel for the appellant that the court

21

has said it is wrong sending the film out of the State.

22

that were true, I wouldn't be here arguing the case.

23

the Supreme Court of Alabama has held in defining the charac­

24

teristics of this tax and its authoritative meaning is that it

25

is directed at the individual photographer and on his activities

the State of Alabama, that is true.
Q

Mien you state this business, what does that

contemplate?
A

Well, this business is to do business as a

transient or travelling photographer.

13

Q

What business is the transient?

14

A

Our court has defined that in this Graves case,

15

Graves versus Alabama.

16

Q

As being?

17

A

As being a photographer who goes about the State

18

from county to county where he has no fixed location.

19

Q

And does what?

20

A

And takes pictures and conducts sittings.

21

Q

It stops with that?

22

A

Yes, sir.

23

Q

You say this doesn't implicate the development of

24
23

the pictures and all the rest of it?
A

No, sir4
21

1

What our court has said that this license is directed

2

at is the photographer taking the picture, conducting the

3

sitting, and, gentlemen, that requires a person with skill.

4

It is an odd in itself.

5

I have always looked on a photographer as somebody

6

who takes a picture.

7

in North Carolina or Tennessee, that is not what this license

8

hits.

It hits the photographer, the individual photographer.
Now this assessment was made against Qian Mills, the

3
10

The proofreaders and the film developers

company.
Q

11

Why make the difference between the transient

12

and the fixed photographer?

13

right?
A

14

No, sir.

They both do the exact same thing,

We say that there is quite a distinction

IS

between the two.

a photograph gallery is another class and that this license

That is true.

8

Q

X would say it would all be

Well, why do you charge the itinerant more if it

is the same action?

9

A

That depends on whether the itinerant or the

10

transient is charged more, if he stays one week, it. is only $5.

ii

But if a person --

12

13

Q

is charged more than the stationary man who works 52 weeks?
A

14
15

Why is it that the itinerant who works 52 weeks

Well, we say they are in different classes or

sub-classes and that the State --Q

16

Yes, your law puts them in different classes but

17

what about the — has your court ever explained or gone into

18

the basis for the different classifications, why the different

19

class?

20

A

I believe, your Honor, in this Graves case they

21

touched on that.

I don't know how deeply.

22

part of the case, but X believe that they did touch on that and

23

in the Graves case they did point out that this transient

24

photographer license, it applies to those who come from without

25

and within the state alike.

23

I don't recall that

1

In other words, a photographer has a fixed location in

iiu

9

Montgomery and it has been so applied, and he sends photographers

3

out in Monroe County or Mobile County, Jefferson or some other

4

county in Alabama, then his photographers, where they don't have

5

a fixed place of business, they pay this license or are supposed

to»

7

Q

Suppose in your State taxation system, a photog­

8

rapher — suppose there is a large photographer's business and

9

he has half a dozen people in there who take the pictures.

10

you charge him one or a half a dozen licenses?
A

11

In that case, your Honor, the license would be

12

on the photograph gallery,

13

is true.

14

Do

Q

It would be only one license, that

Well, I thought you told us a little while ago

15

that this was a personal thing that was directed against the

16

person who takes the pictures and if that is true, why wouldn't

17

you charge him six license fees instead of one if you had six

18

peo£>le taking pictures?

19

20

A

Your Honor, our reasoning there is that they are

two separate and distinct licenses.

21

Q

What are two separate and distinct licenses?

22

A

Well, we say that the photographer who has a

23

fixed place of business is in a different class from the

24

travelling photographer that goes from county to county.

25

is a different, you might say, operation and it is a different
24

That

1

class or sub-class which this court has said that the Congress

2

and the State Legislature can, for the purpose of taxation,

3

set up classes and even sub-classes,

4

What is the State's interest in separating these

Q

5

two that you just mentioned for purposes of taxation?

6

must be some reason for the classification, musn't there be?
A

7

There

Your Honor, I might say this along that line in

8

explanations

In. the case of the fixed location, if you have

9

five places of business in one city, you would have to pay five

to

different licenses.

Under the general provisions of the Revenue

11

Code relating to licenses and more particular, Title 51,

12

Section 831A, if you have got ten places of business, fixed

13

location places of business, then you would pay ten licenses.
Actually, the travelling photographer can take for

14
15

a week on $5 to

16

Whereas, the photographer with the fixed location would have

17

to pay a license for each separate place of business.

those six counties.

22

who takes the pictures in six different counties, but he does

23

not develop them in any of those counties, but sends them off

24

to be finished.

25

Suppose the photographer does business in six counties,

Now suppose there is another photographer

Could you charge him a license, this last one, which
25

1

would bar him from doing that business, if he didn't pay the

2

license or the whole thing?

3

A

Your Honor, in that case, if they have no fixed

4

place of business, I think you would charge them both this $5

5

license just the same whether they develop the film in the

6

county o.r whether they send it out.

7

You would charge him this

takes pictures with the understanding that those will be sent
out of the state, developed and brought back and they complain
that on that business you are charging them a license which
would forbid them to do business without it and you could
prosecute them for it, could you not?
A

Your Honor, you could prosecute or penalize a

person for not paying any tax, whether it is in Oklahoma,
Alabama or anywhere else.
Q

Every one of these statutes ---

Yes, but it is quite different if you are taxing

him, if it can be shown that what your tax is is a tax directly

on Interstate Commerce which says you have got to pay this much
tax to do business in the state in Interstate Commerce.
How are you doing that?
A

Your Honor, we say that we are not.

Because of the fact that this tax is not an

8
9

A

Your Honor, it has been held by this court and

I think you have written some of the opinions that I have read

10

that where you can realistically separate activities and localise

11

them, that you can validly tax that.

12

Q

That is right.

13

A

And that is exactly our contention in this case,

14

and another point right there, this court in United Gas Pipeline

15

versus City of Mobile held that it was the prerogative — I

10

won't, say prerogative — but the right of the State courts to

17

define the meaning of a tax and tell what the characteristics

18

of a tax are.

19

In that case, this court sent that case back to

20

Alabama for the State courts to define the meaning of the tax.

21

And Sir. Justice Douglas there said that the case shouldn't have

22

been sent back.

23

at the time.

24
25

He said the license tax in that case was valid

It didn't need to go back.

Mr. Justice Harlan in that case he says that it
doesn't make any difference whether it was an entrance fee or

But this court —■-

3

Q

Well, which one had the most people with it?

4

A

5

majority of the court sent that case back to Alabama.

6

Q

What was the citation?

7

A

Your Honor, I have it right here.

8

The

That is United

Gas Pipeline versus Ideal Cement Company, 369 U.S. 134.

9

Q

Thank you.

10

A

Mow there is also a case by the Supreme Court of

11

Alabama.

12

Alabama actually defined the characteristics of the tax and it

13
14
15

held that that tax was a local tax although United Gas Pipeline
Company was engaged in transporting gas in Interstate Commerce.
That was their business in selling it.
But they held that this license levied by the city of

16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24

When the case was sent back, the Supreme Court of

Mobile on the selling of natural gas in Mobile was a local

j
lrcense.

And you could realistically separate that activity

from United8s Interstate activity.
That is exactly our argument in this case.
Also, another case that wa rely strongly on is the
Caskey Baking case whereby a license was levied on bakeries.
I believe those selling bread to people, retailers, licensed
retailers in the State of Virginia.

And the bread was baked in

West Virginia and transported over the state line.
25

29

l

1

It is more or less one of the Peddler cases.

2

But this court held that the license tax directed

3

atfchat local activity of selling the bread and delivering it

4

off of the trucks was sufficient for the license tax to validly

5

attach.

6

Another point in the Graves decision, the Supreme

7

Court of Alabama has held that inherently this tax does not

a

discriminate because it applies equally to all transient photog­

9

raphers whether they come within or without the state.

10

Clearly this type of operation, counsel for the

11

appellant relies mainly on the Drummer cases and I suppose; the

12

leading case in that line is the Nippert versus Richmond.

13

there the license was levied on solicitations and the orders

14

were sent to Washington.

15

Washington garment manufacturing company.

15

But

I believe Nippert represented a

The court held that the solicitations were clearly

17

an Interstate Commerce and that the license could not be validly

13

levied in that case.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

Mr. Burton, I am afraid that case illustrates

the fact that you make a mistake in relying on something that
I have written in this field.
A

Well, your Honor, I want to point out one thing.

In that case it was brought out that before you could secure the
license in that case, that you had to get a permit from the
Department of Public Safety.

And that is not so in this case.
30

And along the line of your questioning there, whether

1
2

it was more or less an sntreince fee, this license if you go up

3

to the probate judge's office and you put the money down, you

can get -- everybody is entitled to buy this licensee

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

8

But in present

Mr, Thornton, you may

proceed,

7

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. EDWARD THORNTON, ESQ,

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR, THORNTON:

9

I just have a word,

I think the facts in the Graves case may be of some

10
11

importance,

Olan Mills at that time was engaged in a two-stage

12

operation.

13

soliciting orders.

It had solicitors who went through the states
It had a photographer who followed.

When the photographer came through, they arrested him

14
15

for not having a transient photographers license.

Question No,

16

was, is the mere exposure of film engaging in the business of

17

photography?
And the Supreme Court of Alabama held it was, it being

18
19

so essential a part of the photography business that a license

20

on photography generally would apply to the mere exposure of

21

film.

22
23
24
25

Now it is that holding that comes over into th€;s®
cases here where they say, "Well now, we have already held that
the license is only on.”

That is not quite true.

It was true

in the Graves case because that is all that Graves did.
34

L

n

But they have now come along and said that is all you

I

2

have to do in order to be subjected to the license.

3

but it is true in a sort of a back-handed fashion.

This is true

But, nevertheless, it does show that the license is

4
5

on the mere exposure of film.

6

that whan that is connected with the entire transaction which

7

goes across the State line ——
Q

8
9

And we are taking the position

Well, let me ask you.

If I understood Mr. Burton

correctly, if you had a photographer based in Montgomery and he

10

sent photographers around the six adjoining counties but all

11

of the work was done in the State of Alabama, nevertheless under

12

this s5fcatute as to the activities of those photographers who

13
14

15

went around to the six counties the license fee would be $5 a
week? the $25 a week would be reserved for what was under the
fixed location.
Do you agree with that?

16
17

happened or rather instead of developing everything in the
State of Alabama, of the pictures taken by those photographers
who went around to the six counties, this photographer sent that
part of the business out of state.
Would you be making the same argument that then this
would be discriminatory against Interstate Commerce?

A

Well now on the $25 license in Montgomery on the

$5 license

3

Q

On the $5 license.

4

A

That is this case.

5

Q

I see.

6

A

But here, you see, the point is that we were

?

taking pictures at a fixed location at Penney's.

8

9

Q

Yes, but I gather then, if you are right, then

all that the photographer who now does all of his work in

10

Alabama would have to do to escape that $5 a week tax would be

11

to send the developing work out of Alabama to be done, wouldn’t

12

it?

13

A

Well, the going out of the state is what makes

14

the photography at a fixed location a transient operation.

15

it is already a transient operation, I don’t believe whether he

16

develops it in the state or out of the state makes any difference.

17

Q

If

Yes, but I was trying to get what your view would

18

be of the position where everything is now done in the state

19

and all photographer doss it to change his practice to send the

20

developing work out of the state, your position then would be

21

that what may be a proper tax now would become an unconstitu­

22

tional tax to the extent of the $5 a week charge.

23

Well, that is this case, isn’t it?

24

A

25

Well, no, no, the reason we got the $5 a -week —

the reason we became a transient — repeating myself a little

bit — we expose film at a fixed location»

$25 a year if a license is on it.

Now that should be

Of course, we would contest

We are contesting the license because we say we

Q

I see.

A

But if the license had a fixed location with

charges, it would be $25 a year.

we send it outside

But by reason of the feet that

The only reason they put you in the transient

class is because you send your pictures outside the state?

11

A

That is correct.

12

t hat is my last point.

That is exactly right.

And

We get to that after vre get to — and I don’t ever

want you to get there.

What is that?

Q

How can it be cured?

A

Well, they will just amend the license and say

that regardless of where the film is developed, the license
will be $5 a week.
Q

For

whom?

A

For transientphotographers.
37

3

Q

Well, how do they prove you are a transient?

2

A

The reason they prove we were a transient here

3

was because we sent it outside.
Q

4

©

Well, that is it.

How could they ever prove

that you were a transient if they amended the ordinance like
that?
A

7

Well, my point is that they might cure that by

a

eliminating the discriminatory nature of the tax because of the

9

Interstate activity.

This they could cure.

Q

Well, you see you would still object to the $25

12

A

Oh, yes.

And that is the point you would like us to

Yes.

they can't tax you at all?
A

That is correct.

Q

Now, let us suppose that I am a manufacturing

—- steel products, selling them all over the country, and I
decide to establish an office, a sales office, in Alabama,
Montgomery.

I establish an office and put several employees in

there and the state says, "Look, if you are going to establish
a local office here, you have got to get a license."
And yet every order that is taken is sent out of the
state, is filled from out of the state.

Would you say Alabama

could not make them take out a license to set up a local office?
A

No, I would not say that.
38

I would say they

1

probably couldn't acquire a license for a local office.

2
3

Q

Why can't Alabama do that to you insofar as you

take pictures at a fixed location in Alabama?

4

A

Well, maybe they can.

5

Q

Because that really disposes of your first point?

6

Doesn't it?

7

A

No, my last point.

8

Q

I think it disposes of your first point.

9

A

Well, then if it does I don't want to make that

!0

concession.

11

Q

And I didn't understand your question.

I am sorry.

Well, Mr. Thornton, there is a little more to the

12

facts of this case than just the mere exposure of films, isn't

13

htere?

14

advertising to the fact that these people will be there at a

15

certain time and will have a fixed location in the city to

16

transact this business and it does transact business in this

17

particular place?

Don't we have in this case that Penney gives extensive

18

A

Yes, sir.

19

Q

Well, doesn't that bear somewhat on whether it

20
21

22
23
24
25

is a local thing that is being taxed or not or whether it could
be taxed as a local activity?
A

Well, admittedly, the more local activities we

engage in, the more the state has tc catch on to.
Q

Yes.

A

But we think in this case — you see this license
39

I

isn't at Penney„

If they go at Penney that is a different

2

proposition as to Penney“s activities, with reference to

3

advertising and coming into the state and so forth»
But here where our coming into the state is purely

4
5

transient, we come in and out merely exposing film, we say

6

there that the isolating this part of it and attempting to tax

7

that as a local activity is actually a tax on the entire trans­

8

action.

9

Interstate activity which they can't do.
So the $25 license should not apply, if I am keeping

10
11

myself straight.
Q

12

13

We say that is an attempt by the state to license in

sistent.

Your first point and your last point are incon­

I mean they are mutually exclusive, aren't they?

14

A

I hadn't thought so.

15

Q

No?

IS

A

I hadn't thought so.

Q

Because your last point starts out on the propo­

17

19

24
25

sition that we are taking photographs at a fixed location?
A

Yes.

Q

And the only reason you make an itinerant out

of it is because we send the photographs out of state?
A

That is correct.

Q

But if you say you are taking photographs in a

fixed location, it seems to raa they ought to be able to put the
$25 charge on you.
