ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER S. HANSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

1

Ho. 750, Glenn Martin

MR. HANSON;

Mr. Chief .Justice Warren, and may it

please the Court.
This is a first degree murder case out of the State
of California from the city of Los Angeles, and my client,
Mr. Harrington, according to the evidence participated in the

robbery of a liquor store in the city of Los Angeles, along
with three other co~defendants .
The interesting thing about it was the three other
co-defendants were Negro, Mr. Harrington was a Caucasian and
that is a significant factor which I will point out as we go
along here a little bit.
The court held a preliminary hearing in the case,
according to the California procedure®

And at the time the

preliminary hearing why it showed quite conclusively that there
was going to be a lot of problems in the way of confessions.
It seems that all three of the other co-defendants,
Mr. Rhone, Mr. Bosby and Mr. Cooper, had made confessions
which implicated themselves and each other and Mr. Harrington
2

1

in this particular crime.

2

At the time of the trial setting in various prelimi­

3

nary motions, counsel for Mr. Harrington attempted to get

4

sverance of the trials because of this problem and at that

5

time he cited the case of Belli Paoli versus the United States

-3

and the. Jackson versus Denno decision of this court in an effort

7

to get these trials severed»

8

These motions were denied by the trial court.

9

And at various times during the trial, motions were

10

made to sever the thing, each time as to Harrington being

11

denied.

12

I think it rather interesting that throughout this

13

trial numerous pages were devoted to in-chambers discussion

14

between the counsel and the court in an effort to alter these

15

various confessions in such a way that no incriminating state­

16

ments were made as to the one man versus the other.

\7

I set that out in my brief and it is contained in

18

the single appendix for the court and I think it is

19

exemplary of the impossibility in this particular case as it

20

is in most cases to make a meaningful deletion of the names

21
22
23
24
25

very

to the point where in this case it became so ridiculous that the
court upon being accused by Mr. Harrington's attorney at the
tiraa of trying to make the matter more difficult for his
counsel said I am going to let all these confessions come in
just the way they stand unedited.
3

Mow Mr. Rhone made the confession which was probably
the most damaging and I suppose the single, possibly weak point
in my position here is that Mr. Rhone did in fact take the
stand for cross-examination»
The

other two gentlemen, Mr» Cooper and Mr. Bosby

are referred to Mr. Harrington as the white man, the Caucasian
and various other terms, never actually calling him by name
which is probably caused by the fact that they didn't know
each other too well.
So in that particular sense neither one of the other
two actually named Mr. Harrington, but without a doubt because
all four of them were being jointly tried, all four of them
sitting at the counsel table together, three Negroes and the
Caucasian, Mr. Harrington, coupled with Mr. Rhone's confession,
actually naming Mr. Harrington why there is little doubt that in
my opinion all four of these confessions or all three of the
confessions solidified each other and brought home the inevit­
able result that took place in this particular trial.
Now, it is my contention here, of course when 1
filed the petition

for certiorari of this court, it was prior

to the decision of the court in Bruton versus the United States
and Roberts versus Russell.
At the time I filed the petition I was going after
a reversal of the Belli Paoli case and so when the court handed
down the Bruton decision and the Roberts versus Russell
4

decision I anticipated the case being remanded to the District
Court of Appeals in California with the usual admonition to
reconsider the case in a matter not inconsistent with this
particular opinion and so I was elated to have the chance
to coma to Washington when the court granted a hearing in the
case.
it is my contention upon reviewing all the decisions
of this court and the prime one that I hang my hat on is
Brookhart versus Janis case, 384 U.S„ 1, decision by Mr. Justice
Black which I have cited throughout my documents that I have
filed that if there was a denial of confrontation of witnesses,
without waiver, why it would be a constitutional error in the
first order of magnitude and no amount of want of prejudice
would save this error from the case.
Of course in the Brookhart case as the court knows,
with malice of forethought the confession of the co-defendant
was actually used against Mr. Brookhart.

It was introduced for

that particular purpose and so the Court without hesitation in
an eight-man opinion by Mr. Justice Black reversed that case
without recourse to any consideration of harmless error rules.
In the Bruton case then, if I interpret that case
correctly, the court went on to acknowledge that in its opinion
it would be impossible for a jury to discern the difference
between confessions of this type being given by
A.

With an instruction to not consider it against B,
5

only consider it against A, never against B,
2

By Mr» Justice Brennan in that case* if I add

3

Brookhart to Bruton it is my position in front of this court

i

today that it calls for an automatic reversal of this case

5

and all such cases on a national basis without recourse to

5

any harmless error rules whatsoever»

7

Now in the concurring opinion by Mr» Justice Stewart

3

in Chapman versus California, there is numerous type of errors

9

that are set out called for automatic reversal»

And as I

10

understand, Mr. Justice Stewart in that case, you took the

n

position that no harmless error rule should be applied at all

12

in this particular type of error.
And as I go through the various types of vases that

13
14

this court has passed judgment on, the Gideon versus Wainwright

15

type of denial of counsel, reversed without recourse to
harmless error and retroactively so.

16

The Jackson versus Denno case was a very analogous

17

type of error, reversed without recourse to a harmless error

13

rule, retroactively so.

19

In other words, we have in one hand as I study the

20

cases the type of errors that actually book place during the

21

trial itself, the denial of counsel at trial, the introduction

22

of coerce confessions, this type of thing which actually

23

permeated the very trial itself as opposed to certain pretrial

24

type of maneuvers in the way of the Miranda errors where the

25

6
I

1

court said that its reason for reversing and not making it
retroactive was because of the fact it wanted to discourage

3

police conduct in these errors»
The search and seizure issues, of course, are along

4

5

the same linas»

But this type of error which we have in front

6

of the court today to me there can be no question whatsoever

7

that it has to be resulting in a reversal without recourse

8

to any harmless error rules whatsoever»
1 think, based upon my own personal experience in

9
10

Los Angeles in trying some major cases, that I can think of no

11

more severe error than a defense counsel would have to attempt

!2

to overcome than this particular one that took place in this

13
14

case.
I think it alters entirely the defense of the case»
The State of Illinois in its amicus curiae brief pointed out

16
17
13

ID
20
21

22
23
24

that after all Mr. Harrington did no more than put the State
of California to its test to see if it had enough evidence
to convict him»
He did not take the stand»

He put on next to no

defense whatsoever and I simply contend and point out to the
ourt: that in my opinion, when a magnitudinal error such as
three confessions were introduced against him, the entire
strategy of the case would change»
He was, I must admit, a previous loser»
doing time up in San Quentin for previous crimes»

25

7

He had been
He therefore

had the problem that he would be impeached as a witness by
previous convictions of a felony and so the counsel at that
time apparently elected to not put him on the stand so, therefor:
1 contend that the entire strategy of the trial is altered
by this particular difficulty and. it is impossible for any
reviewing court to say with any certainty that harmless error
did not take place if the court is constrained to even apply
harmless error rule to it.
This court, of course, has considered an analogous
situation in the Barber versus Page case of the past term
where the preliminary hearing testimony was introduced at the
trial without making an effort to get the witness in front of:
the court again to reverse, again reversal without recourse
to harmless error rules and in the recent case of Berger versus
California the court made it agciin retroactive.
And I can only conclude that the court did the
requisite amount of soul searching during the deliberations in
chambers as to the magnitude of this particular error.

I don't

think the court would make an error of this magnitude retro­
active unless it considered it to be a severe one, a tremen­
dously severe one.
It is my contention that because of this severity
of this error it is not at all applicable to any type of
harmless error rules that must be reversed per se, throughout
the nation when this type of thing takes place.

Q

Did Harrington take the stand himself?

A

Mo,, your Honor., he did not,

Harrington did not

take the stand,
Q

One of the co-defendants who testified did take

the stand?
A

Mr, Rhone took the stand,

Q

You don't have any Bruton problem there,

A

No, actually we don't,

Q

The other two did not take the stand?

A

That is correct.

Q

So that in a-sense their testimony was sort of

cumulative, wasn't it?
A

No question about it.

Q

I take it that if only Rhone had been involved

here there wouldn't have been any problem under Bruton?
A

Apparently not, had he taken the stand been

the only co-defendant apparently we wouldn't have the Bruton
problem but as I read the Sixth Amendment it says you have a
right to be confronted by all the witnesses.
Q

Just in terns of harmless error were the con­

fessions any — were Rhone's, as far as Harrington was concerned,
was there any measurable difference between Rhone's confession
and the confession of the other two?
A

No, actually not.

As a matter of fact they

probably were not near as damaging because of the reason they
9

!
2

didn't name him per se, like Mr. Rhone did.
Q

So in terras of the impact on Harrington, his

3

ability to cross-examine Rhone, would it have done him any

4

good to be able to cross-examine the other two?

can't see how you can bifurcate the thing.

I

You might have

10

49 witnesses that didn't take the stand and one that did, and

11

it is just inconceivable to me that you can split hairs on the

\2

number that did and the number that did not.

This was a very severe type of case that ---

25

Did you say the confessions of the other two

did not name Harrington?
A

Well, did not name him explicitly.

It referred

to him as the white man, the Caucasian, the patti, and such
things of this nature, in such a way that with all four of
them sitting at the witness table, what other conclusion
could you come to that they were likewise referring to
Mr. Harrington.
There is little doubt about it in my opinion.
I might remind the court also of the recent decision
of Smith versus Illinois which was as I recall the major issue
that confronted the court was a question of a witness as to
10

what your address is and he did not answer? before the answer
came in — the court sustained an objection to answering that
question»
This court reversed again summarily without recourse
to any harmless error rule for the simple defect as I understand
it, no response to the question, "Where do you live?"
And it was held in citing again with approval of
Brookhart versus Janis case that if there is a denial of
confrontation of witnesses, it is a constitutional error of
the first order of magnitude and no want of prejudice will save
it»
I simply in reading that case to which eight members
of this court, I think Justice Marshall was not on the bench
at that time or did not participate at that time, but apparently
eight members of this court signed their name to it subscribing
assent to the words of Mr, Justice Black in the Brookhart
versus Janis case that this type of thing would not be subject
to any type of harmless error rule»
Q

Are the statementsof those three in the record?

A

Yes, every confession is in the record»

Q

Can you tell me quickly where?

A

Well, I pointed it out»

I did not index my

By and. large I might move on to that and by and large

11

the chief evidence against Mr. Harrington was, other than the

confessions, was a couple of people who worked in the store

13

who fortunately lived to tell about it.

The proprietor of the store was a woman and another
male clerk was in the store.

The interesting thing about it

was when these people reported the crime and made their
statements to the police, the man without hesitation admitted
that he said four Negroes carried this crime out.
The woman equivocated somewhat but also admitted that
she had told the police that in her opinion four Negroes had
carried the crime out.
It is, therefore, my contention that an astute
attorney in defense of these gentlemen, at least in defense
of Mr.Harrington, absent the various errors that have occurred
in this case, shall certainly have a fighting chance for an
12

acquittal in this case, because if they cannot tell the dif­
ference between Caucasian and Negro, why perhaps other evidence
that they testified to would be much weaker also,
I would ask the court to in its opinion attempt to
spell out with great specificity, this Bruton, Roberts versus
Russell error.
years,

It has been one that has hung around for many

I am confident that the court did not spell it out in

such a way that, there can be little doubt as to what the court
means.
The court is going to be inundated with petitions
for certiorari for the next decade,

I think the case that

just preceded this one, Banks versus California, is an excellent
example of the fact that the Griffin rule is apparently
still being emasculated

by the various lower level courts

around the nation and to me there just is no question that it
must be subjected to a reversability, per se, if the Brookhart
versus Janis opinion is interpreted correctly by myself,
I just can’t believe that this type of error is
any different than the Gideon versus Wainwright error, if I look
at the Sixth Amendment and read it I see the right to counsel
and the right to confront witnesses in the same paragraph,
I could read that short portion of it,
it is more familiar to the court than myself.

I am sure

And I did bring

it along with me, because I saw the television show on
Mr, Justice Black’s birthday a few months ago where you referred
13

to the copy of the Constitution that you carry with you.» and
so 1 had it along with me in case I had to refer to it.
But 1 think if the Court will check the Sixth Amend­
ment those two types of rights are set forth right beside each
other in the Sixth Amendment.

And I can't see that they can

therefore be distinguished.
That the Gideon versus Wainwright case be given
total retroactivity x^ith no application of harmless error rule
sc must the error in the Harrington case, Bruton versus
the United States, Roberts versus Russell, must likewise be
given reversal without

recourse to any harmless error rules.

It is just impossible to calculate the impact of
this type of thing.
Q

The majority of the court held in the Fifth

Amendment there, the no comment rule, was the harmless error
rule, didn't we?
A

I beg your pardon?

Q

The majority of the court held as far as the

no comment rule was concerned it was subject to a harmless
■ error test?

|

I

A

That is the Griffin error.

Q

Yes.

A

That is correct.

Q

So you say that the Bruton rule stands on a

level above that?

with the Gideon versus Wainwright type of error and -—■

What if it was the defendant's own confession

You mean the Miranda type error?

No, just the coerced confessions.

No, no, there is no harmless error in coerced

And, why?

Because it is a confession?

Because

it is especially damaging evidence?
A

17

confessions.

15
16

You don't get. the harmless error in those

cases do you?

11

14

Well, that is one that is of the same magnitude

Well, I read your majority opinion in Jackson

versus Denno and I found it difficult to believe he could
dissent in the Bruton case the way you did but perhaps that is
because I am not astute enough to discern -—*
Q

That is the confession of a co-defendant?

A

Yes, I know.

21
And I contend that is much more

22
damaging.

I think the confession of a man himself is much

23
more reliable index than the confession of a co-defendant.
24
Q

Well, that is the point.

25
15

That is the point.

1

A

Well;, I tried a case in Los Angeles»

You

probably will hear more about it,

v*

O

name of Robert Massey who contends that he has the right to

4

be executed and I think that Justice Douglas stayed the

5

execution here a few weeks ago.

It involves a man by the

But he is now in San .Quentin and he contends he has

0
7

a right to be executed and the Supreme Court of California I

3

guess agrees with him because they have gone along with him

9

because his petitions do not have any attorneys represent him

10

and things like this.
But I tried that case with the Bruton error in it, or

11

12

I mean after the Bruton error was reversed and I got an

13

acquittal of this man and of his co-defendant Mr, John Better

14
15
16
17

and I think that the court — anyone, anyone that has to check
the impact of this type of thing,get in and try it one time and
it is an insurmountable thing when the co-defendant makes a
confession.
Because I think that people who sit on the jury will

13
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

say, rightfully so, that only somebody with a warped mind
would accuse somebody, but in the Massey case, very clear
Mr, Massey came down the second time and testified that he
had accused Mr, Better of this crime simply because he got mad
at him.

That he actually was not with him.
Just because he got mad at him.
In this particular case, the inference is that he
16

lied about it» but 1 don't think a confession by somebody
himself would be subject to that same type of attack»
If I confess that I committed a murder» I think that
is pretty reliable index of guilt»

Quite reliable» as opposed

to my accusing somebody else and sustaining the conviction of
somebody else on my testimony without my getting on the stand
for cross-examination»
I still have difficulty -Q

Yes, but I would suppose that a man's own con­

fession may be more reliable?
A

That is what I contend»

Q

Yes»

A

And in Jackson versus Denno this was reversed

Q

That is right»

per se»
But Bruton involved a confession

of somebody else.
A

And you feel that is not the same difficulty?

Q

That is what I said, yes.

A

1 read that but I still don't understand it»

Q

I suppose it is a very similar argument to what

you have got here in this case.
A

I am sure that is correct.

Well, I will defer to my opponnent at this time and
save the remaining amount of time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Kline.

1

OPAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. KLINE, ESQ*

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR» KLINEz

o
4

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
The respondent and the amici join the respondent

6
7

are vitally concerned over the impact of Bruton versus United
States and Roberts versus Russell.
We feel that these two cases will have a profound

8
9
10
1!

12
13
14
15
16

effect on the administration of justice throughout the various
States.
Now, Petitioner Harrington would expand the impact of
these two cases by, one, making a Bruton error, per se,
reversible without applying any type of harmless error standard;
and two, by making Bruton fully retroactive.
At this time I would like to tell this court the
experience of California as to joint trials.
We have a penal code statute which authorizes joint

17
18
19
20

trials and we have obtained statistics from the Los Angeles
District Attorney's office with regard to joint trials for
the year 1967 and 1968.
Statistics for these two years, from this particular

21

county reflect that approximately 20 percent of the trials
22
involve two or more defendants.
23

Now if this percentage prevails throughout the State,
24

this represents a sizable number of cases in California.
25

18

For instance, in 1967 there was a total of 13,500 contested
criminal matters tried in the Superior Court of California.
In 1968 there was a total of 16,140 contested criminal matters
tried in the Superior Courts throughout the State.

As you can

tell the figures are progressingly getting higher and if you go
back ten years, you go back twenty years, if you go back thirty
years, the aggregate number of cases affected by Bruton is
truly staggering.
Now, let us turn our attention to Mr. Hanson's first
contention that the Chapman harmless error rule is not appli­
cable to a Bruton-type of situation.
As I have indicated in my brief, a vast number of
cases subsequent to Bruton which have discussed this issue have
held that Bruton is not automatically reversible.

I submit

that logic and and sound policy support this rule.
It is obvious that there are material variances in
co-defendants8 statements with regard as to their inculpating
effect as well as to whether the fact they added critical weight
to the prosecution's case.
Now if an automatic reversal rule is adopted by
the court, then a Bruton situation would be reversed, regardless
if the particular error conceivably played any part in the
verdict, either on direct appeal or on collateral attack.
Indirectly this court has indicated in Gilbert versus
California that a harmless error rule is applicable to a
19

1

Bruton-type situation,,
There, if you recall

2

,

the petitioner had a confession

3

used against him in which he was mentioned approximately 159

4

times,,

5

Delli Paoli at that time and this court declined to do so

6

noting that the California Supreme Court had adopted a randum

7

which had rejected Delli Paoli.
This court also noted that the California Supreme

G
9
10

11
12

13

Court had held the particular Bruton errorharmless in Griffin
and this court noted that the harmless error standard applied
by the California Supreme Court was substantially in compliance
with Fahy and Chapman.

16

17
18
19
20
21

22

Therefore, this court declined to rule

on Delli — overrule on Delli Paoli at that time.
Now, 1 would submit that the fair import of these

14
15

The petitioner there requested that this court overrule

remarks

is that Bruton is subject to a Chapman's harmless

error statute, standard.
It should be noted that the Burton case was an extreme
case factually.

The co-defendant's statement was not admissable

against the co-defendant Evans.
As a result, since it was inadmissable against Evans,
there was nothing on the other hand in which to alleviate any
possible pressures against Bruton.
Also, the identification evidence was much weaker

23
against Bruton than against Evans.

And as a result, on retrial

24
Evans was acquitted and so, therefore, the Solicitor General
25

indicated because of these facts the case should be reversed.
Now we contend that the evidence in the instant case
is much stronger than was the situation in Brutosi.
Before I apply the Chapman harmless error standard to
the instant case I would like to delineate six factors which I
think is pertinent to any inquiry in applying Chapman to a Bruto:a
type situation.
The first factor to consider* of course* is the quality
of limiting instruction given by the trial judge.

If a

particularly lucid and precide instruction is promptly given
to the jury before the statement is introduced into evidence*
I would think this would help alleviate some prejudice of an
incriminating statement.
And I note with interest Fraser versus Cupp, which
was rendered by this court yesterday in which in the context
of an opening statement, this court indicated that a limiting
instruction can be effected to that extent.
The second factor to consider, of course, is the
nature of the co-defendantss statement.
his fair share of guilt?

Did defendant assume

This court noted in Bruton that it

is common with co-defendants to shift the blame, but if the
defendant assumes his fair share of the guilt that is something
to consider also.
The Third factor to consider also is the amount of
detail concerning actions of other parties.

21

In other words,

?

if the details in the incrimingating confessions is quite

2

s kimpy in comparison with the other prosecution evidence I

3

would think this is the pertinent inquiry in applying Chapman,
The fourth factor to take into consideration is the

weight of the other evidence,

evidence is quite strong, then it would be my contention that
the jury would

-foe more unlikely to disobey a court's limiting

instruction,
And the fifth factor to consider, of course, is the

10

ISJow if the weight of the other

nature of the defense.

Did the defendant offer any testimony

in support of his defense or did he just put the prosecution
11
12

to its proof,
Q

Would you add one more to the extent of how

13

many confessions naming the same man were introduced?
14

Well, suppose you had five men jointly tried,

A

Yes.

And five made confessions naming the sixth one.

19

Would you take that into consideration that you had five
20

different ones, emphasizing over and over again?
21

A

Yes, your Honor,

I think that is a pertinent

22

factor to consider in applying Chapman,
23
Q

Well, there were three here, weren't there?

A

Yes, there were three co-defendants, your Honor,

the fact that Rhone did admit making the statement and hints

9

the situation with Rhone is vastly different from Douglas

And in that regard I would like to emphasize

10

versus Alabama, where under the guise of refreshing a witness’

recollection, the prosecutor asked the witness to either deny

12

or affirm certain statements that he made in his confession.

25

This court indicated that since the wintess had de­
clined to answer any of these questions that the other codefendant was denied his right of confrontation because he had
not admitted making such a statement.
Nov; that situation is different from this situation
because Rhone did submit such a statement.
0

The other two confessions didn’t mention

Harrington, did they?
A

That is correct.

Q

The other two confessions mentioned the only

white man in the group?
A

Yes, that is true, your Honor.

But before I turn my attention to the other two
23

confessions, 1 would like to emphasise the fact that Rhone is
the only person that does name petitioner Harrington and he is
the only one that details the activities of Rhone, both before
the robbery and after the robbery *
Rhone was quite explicit while telling where Harringtc
was while in the store at the different events that occurred
in the store.
Q

He also indicated that --Well, the

other two in their confessions never

said that the only white man x^as Harrington?
A

No, he did not.

The only reference is to a white

man.
And in that regard I would like to turn my attention
to Bosby's statement.
Q

Well, excuse me, if we should decide that a

harmless error doctrine is applicable in this Bruton-type
situation, do you think

we ought to decide whether this record

shows that the error is harmless or send it back?
A

Your Honor, I am very happy you asked the

question, because X think the lower court has used the standard
which is the equivalent of Chapman and may I refer your Honor
to page 437 of the single appendix in x^hich it is part of the
opinion of the lower State court.
Now the lov;er State court summarised the admissible
evidence besides the three co-defendants8 confessions.

And

they said that in summarizing the admissible constitutional
24

1

evidence, "It is virtually inconceivable that any jury could

2

have escaped the conclusion that Harrington was engaged in

Q

attempted robbery and was answerable for the murder committed

4

by his co-conspirator in the course thereof»"

iJ

Now it is our contention that it is virtually incon­

5

ceivable is the equivalent beyond a reasonable doubt»
Q

7

But that means virtually inconceivable to the

court.

have found it virtually or a juror could have found it
virtually inconceivable?
A

court is that it is virtually inconceivable that any jury
could have escaped the conclusion, so I think the court itself
has answered your Honor's question.
Q

Well, there is still a difference between

saying a jury or a juror because if you have just one juror
who felt that Harrington was not the man and that that would
have prevented a returning of a guilty verdict, wouldn't it?
A

21
22

Your Honor, I think the precise language of the

Your Honor, I would disagree with the test as

you propose.
Q

Well, I am not sure that is the test, but if

23

it were the test, but what I am asking you, suggesting to you,
24

is that there is a difference between the court saying that it
25

25

doesn't believe that a jury could have escaped the conclusion
and the court facing up

to a very difficult problem, which is

whether a single rational juror, a single rational juror, might
have arrived at the conclusion that he could not find
Harrington guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, absent these
statements in the confessions,
A

I would agree, it would appear that those are

two different matters.

But I would disagree with the appli­

cability of that particular statement,
Q

You would say that we ought to look at it from

the point of view of the jury

as a whole?

A

Yes, jury as a whole. Because after all --

Q

But that is different, do you agree that that

is different from the point of view of the court, looking at
it fromthe point of
A

view of the court himself?

Well, I think the court can look

at the case

as a whole, evidence as a whole, and determine if any particular
error in the context of the evidence as a whole
where a

is prejudicial

jurycould conceivably reach any different verdict

but for the fact that the error was not admitted.

inquiries, psychological differences of the greatest subtlety
and perhaps -Q

3

Q

When you get into terms of framing the harmless

error test in terms of second-guessing what the jury is* you
are in deep trouble aren't you?

4

A

Yes* I would think so.

5

Q

Yes* and the real question here is whether or

6

not it is unconstitutional for a State to have a harmless error

rule which says* "We the judges will take a look at this record

mitted to stand.
Isn't that what it comes down to?

And the question

is whether that is unconstitutional.
We reverse cases, and we did one the other- day where
because we couldn't tell whether a verdict rested on one ground
which was impermissible or another

ground.

We can't tell.

And the case has to be sent back.
Q

Yes* I would agree with that position.

Yes*

your Honor.
Q

It seems to me a shadowboxing a little bit if

you try to talk about the Chapman rule in terms of secondguessing* either in terms of one juror or in terms of a jury
as a whole* and appellate second-guessing what a jury would
have done under any kind of evidence.
A

Yes* your Honor.

Q

But I suppose there is a question* counsel* as
27

to whether the standard,of harmless error adopted by a State
court should be considered in terms of State law?
A

Yesf your Honor.

Q

But what you are talking about hers is the

impact of the deprival of a Federal constitutional right.
You are talking about the application of a standard that this
court fixed in the interpretation and standard that this court
laid down in
A

the Chapman case.
Yes, your Honor.

It is true that the standard utilized by the lower
court is the State harmless error standard, but it is my
contention that in view of the language of the lower court
that the harmless error standa,rd utilized as such is the
equivalent of Chapman.
I would like to point out that in Gilbert versus
California a comparable situation was there, too.

There the

California Supreme Court had utilized the State harmless error
standard in reference to the Griffin error and this court indi­
cated that that standard was substantially equivalent of Fahy
and Chapman and the result indicated that it need not overrule
Belli Paoli.
So I would indicate that the same reasoning it can
be applied here since it is virtually inconceivable what I
would equate beyond a reasonable doubt.
Now, let us turn our attention to Bosby’s statement.
28

1

In regard to Bosby's statement, counsel for petitioner Harrington

2

made an interesting corranent.and this is contained at page

3

237 of the single appendix, and he states as follows:
In reference to Bosby's statement, "Largely here in

4
5

the Bosby statement we have a statement which is not in essence

6

terribly incriminating against Harrington as it was originally

7

given.

He didn't even know Harrington’s name."
That is true.

first name.

He didn't even know Harrington's

He further described Harrington as a blond-headed

fellow — and this is contained at page 286 of the single
appendix.

All the prosecution witnesses in the instant case

indicated that the defendant was a red-haired man, that he
had bright red, shiny hair and yet Bosby describes him as a
blond-headed fellow and if the jury literally followed that
description, they would think that some other defendant
besides Harrington was involved.
Furthermore, in comparison with Rhone's confession
as compared to Bosby's confession, the details of the white
man is extremely limited.
For instance, Eosby indicated that he presumed that
the white man entered the store with Charles.

Bosby did not

know where the white man wa3 at the time of the gunshot.
Furthermore, Bosby never saw him with a gun.

So when you

23
compare Harrington statement — when you compare Rhone's
24
statement which does not fall within the Bruton ambit, Bosby's
25
29

?

statement Is extremely limited with reference to the incrimi­

2

nating details as to the white man’s role in the robbery.
Now let us turn our attention to the two statements

3
4

of Cooper.

5

statement, of course, is an exculpatory statement.

6

denied any involvement in the crime whatsoever.

7

indicated that he entered the store, approached the cash

8

register, attempted to cash a check, noticed that there was a

9

scuffle, a subsequent gunshot, he became frightened and ran

10
11

s4
15

18

Interesting

21

enough he mentions the fact that there

were other Caucasions around the store, before he entered the
store.

While he was attempting to cash the check at the cash

register he indicates that there was a white guy behind him.
Now we don't know if this white guy that was behind
him refers to petitioner Harrington or to some other Caucasion
that Cooper had made reference to before.
He also indicated that there was a white boy in

19
20

He merely

his car.

16

17

There he

out the store, got in his car and three other people got in

12

13

Cooper actually made two statements,, the first

Cooper’s car at the time Cooper got in the car.

At no time

did Cooper get into — At no time did Cooper see the white boy
with the gun, which is again at variance with the prosecution

22

testimony.
23
Details of the white man’s role in the robbery is
24
even more skimpy than Bosby's confession.
25
30

Now, Cooper’s second statement, that is, the Cooper's
confession is only three pages long.
of what the white man did,
store.

It has a few more details

The four c£ them did go to the

The four of them did go into the store.

The white man

followed Cooper into the store and that is the only reference
that we have with reference to the white man as to Cooper's
confession.
Again, we don't know what transpired in the store.
Wa don't know whether Harrington had a gun.

We don't know

whether Harrington tried to get in the cash register or not.
In short, the references to Cooper and Bcsby's
statement are very limited in describing the activities of
the white man while in the store.

The white man's role in

planning the robbery we don't know about and in comparison
with Rhone's confession, Rhone is quite explicit on all these
things and I would contend that Cooper's and Bosby's statements
are merely cumulative of detail which was admissible in Rhone's
confession.
In addition, the other evidence presented by the
prosecution was exceedingly strong because this was no circum­
stantial evidence as was the situation in Chapman.

We have

not two witnesses; wa have three witnesses who positively
identified petitioner Harrington.
We have Mrs. Robbins, the proprietor of the store,
her brother Mr. Ashcraft, as well as a customer by the name of
Mrs. Williams.
31

Mow, two of these witnesses described Harrington as
a red-haired chap.

It should be noted at the time of trial

Harrington did not have red ahir.

He had black hairs, because

Harrington had dyed his hair black after the robbery, and I
would claim that this is significant in strengthening their
identification since they recognized the fact that this was the
red-haired chap that they had seen going into the store.
Furthermore, we have Harrington's very incriminating
statements he made to the police.

Harrington admitted the fact

that he was the red-haired chap that entered the store with
three Negro companions.
That after the murder he ran to the car with three
other Negroes.

That subsequent thereto, he dyed his hair red,

he shaved off his red mustache.

And I must agree with the

lower court, it is virtually inconceivable that any jury would
have come to any other conclusion than it did even absent the
error of admitting Bosby’s and Cooper's statements.
Furthermore, I would think that the ■— as I have indi­
cated earlier — that the lower court has resolved the harmless
error using a Chapman test and I would analogize to the situation
in Gilbert versus California, which this court indicated that
when the California Supreme Court utilize a standard comparable
to Chapman that is permissible.
And I would think the lower court that since the lower
court did the same thing in the instant case, that that rational;
32

should be applicable here also»
Next, I would like to discuss retroactivity,
approach this subject with a little bit of concern.

I

It is ray

purpose in discussing retroactivity with the hope that you
would reconsider Roberts versus Russell,
Nov/ this court has indicated there are three criteria
in determining whether a rule should be prospectively applied
or retroactively applied.

They are the purpose of the rule,

of the reliance on the old rule, the effect on the adminis­
tration of justice.
Now the purpose of Bruton obviously is to insure
the reliability of the fact-finding process but that purpose
need not necessitate the fact that the rule has to be applied
retroactively.
For instance, in Johnson versus New Jersey, this
court indicated there is a question of probability, you have
to look to see if there are other safeguards.

And, by compari­

son I would compare the situation to Stovall versus Denno
which this court limited the retroactivity as the lineup cases.
Now surely there can be no greater affecting the
reliability of fact-finding process than to have a suggested
lineup and a mistake in identification.

Certainly that leads

Yet this court indicated that

Q

Are you also arguing for reconsideration of

Bruton, is that it?
A

No, your Honor, 1 am asking for reconsideration

of Roberts versus Russell.

My discussion here is only applying

the case retroactively and I would hope that this court v/ould
reconsider Roberts and I am just trying to indicate that
cases before Bruton should not have to comply with the
Bruton new constitutional rule because of the fact of reliance.
For over 70 years this court has indicated that
Belli Paoli procedure is all right.

As late as January 23,

1S67, in Spencer versus Texas, this court has cited Belli
Paoli and endorsed Belli Paoli and as leifce as June 12, 1967,
in Gilbert versus California, this court declined to overrule

25

34

Delii Paoli and 1 submit that as late as 1967, in view of
Spender and Gilbert, that it would have been most difficult to
predict the demise of Delia. Paoli.
It should foe noted that Jackson versus Denno which
this court indicated for Bruton was decided June of 1964*
i

and Gilbert is nearly three years later and yet this court
declined to overrule Delli Paoli.

And I would like to emphasize the fact that this
thus will affect the significant number of cases throughout

the courts throughout the land.

because Bruton only assists those who really band together,

13

those vicious criminals who are engaged in robberties such as

in the instant case.

I think this new constitutional

And Bruton helps those criminals who have been in

17

adhered to by this court, that means that a conviction that is

18

20 years old x^ould have to be reversed and the chances of

19

a retrial are almost di minimus because the fact that

20

witnesses cannot be located and the fact that witness'

recollection fade.

22

If the retroactivity doctrine is still

A fully retroactive group, along with the fact that

it is not subject to a harmless error rule would truly have

a profound effect on the administration of criminal justice

Well, in the Chapman decision, the Court says

per Mr. Justice Black, ,sWe prefer the approach of this court
in deciding what was harmless error in our recent case of Fahy
versus Connecticut."
There we said,

"The question is whether there is a

reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might
have contributed to the conviction."
And a little bit later Justice Black says, "There
is little if any difference between our statement in Fahy
versus Connecticut about 'whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction* and requiring the beneficiary of
constitutional error to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that

25

the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict

obtained,"

Do you mean any alleged Bruton violation?

Oh, 1 just can't believe that an error of this

magnitude can ever be said noncontributory.

You will recall they talked about a white marie

Welly there are a good many millions of white men in the world»
A

Welly I am aware of that but if that argument

holds any v/ater then they must have convicted him on something

5

else beside those statements.

Because if the statements were to be believed, that

they were exculpatory as to Mr, Harrington, why presumably he

wouldn't have been convicted,

Q

Mr. Hanson, wouldn't you agree that there, is a

great deal of difference between these two considerations.
On the one hand what does the court conceive of as the
impact of this particular error, namely the admission of the
confessions of the co-defendants?
Mo. 2.

That is No. 1,

Does the court believe that considering the

record, the rest of the record without reference to the con­
fessions of the co-defendants, is there beyond reasonable doubt
in the court's mind whether from its point of view or its
assumption of the jury's point of view, convincing evidence
beyond a reasonable doubt that the man was guilty?
I am asking whether you agree that those two things
are different; that is to say, one, did the admission of the
confessions of the co-defendants contribute to the result or
two, eliminating the confessions of the co-defendant, does
there remain in the record evidence beyond a reasonable doubt—
to shorten it up -- that the defendant was guilty?
41

1

A

Welly point No* 1, I certainly agree there is a

2

marked difference between those two statements, a very marked

3

difference*

4

to the Federal harmless error rule, namely, if there is an

5

error of this magnitude in the case, did that contribute, and

6

I think in most all cases you have to say it did contribute*

7

I think the second statement is more analogous

Q

Welly that is the first one.

You heard the

8

Banks argument.

9

heard the Banks argument here in the preceding case?

That is the first alternative that I put.

You {

10

A

Yes, I did*

11

Q

And there we were talking about a standard used

32

by the California court to the effect that looking at the

13

evidence as a whole and discounting the comment, the improper

14

comment, the court felt that beyond a reasonable doubt this

fellow was guilty.
A

I am aware of that.

That is the so-called State

harmless error rule.
Q

That goes to an evaluation of the total record

absent the unconstitutional aspect of it and I was suggesting
that perhaps there was a difference between that and an
evaluation of whether the error contributed to the verdict.
A

I quite agree.

I think there is a marked

difference between those two types of analysis.

I think the

first one is typical of the State of California’s position,
and the latter one is the Federal harmless error rule, which

Justice Black in the Chapman case said that when there is a

constitutional error of Federal nature we prefer to apply our

Federal harmless error rule to the case»
