ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRIS WEINSTEIN, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WEINSTEIN:

9
10

the Court.
This Federal income tax case comes to this court on

11
12

13

a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit.
The issue involves the meaning of the words scholar­

14

15
16
17
18

ship and fellowship grant which are used in Section 117 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

PA
22
23
24

That section of the Code allows

the recipient to exclude the amount of scholarships or fellow­
ships from his gross income.
That is, it makes scholarships and fellowships tax

19
20

Mr. Chief Justice/ and may it please

exempt.
This case typifies a tax problem that seems to have
arisen since the 1954 Cods was adopted.

At least Congress in

writing Section 117 in the legislative history showed no then
awareness of this type of problem.
It is basically this;

It goes to the meaning of the

25
2

1

word scholarship and fellowship in a commercial setting»

2

those words encompass the situation where an employer gives

3

his employee leave from his regular duties and continues the

4

employee’s regular salary or the greater part of it while the

5

employee is taking a graduate degree on the,subject matter of

6

his employment.

7

Do

And at the same time the employer obligates the

8

employee to return to work for some specified minimum period

9

of time.

10

The issue comes to the court because of a split of

11

authority among the lower Federal Courts.

12

Circuits and the Court of Claims have each sustained Treasury

13

regulations tending to the view that payments made in this type

14

of commercial setting are not scholarships or fellowships.

15

The Fifth and Sixth

The Third Circuit in this case has rejected those

16

regulations, has ruled that these payments are a scholarship

17

or fellowship and has reversed a jury verdict in favor of the

18

United States.

19

The precise problem comes out of payments that the

20

Westinghouse Electric Corporation made to three respondents

21

before this court* at a time when those respondents were on

22

leave on doctoral discertations.

23

These amounts were paid pursuant to a program avail­

24

able to engineers and scientists employed at the Bettis Atomic

25

Power Laboratory at Pittsburgh* Pennsylvania.
3

That is a laboratory owned by the Atomic Energy

1
2
3

C ommission and most if not all of its activities seem to be
in the design of nuclear reactors for producing electric power.
Westinghouse operates the laboratory under a cost-

4
5

plus contract with the Atomic Energy Commission.
In this particular program we are concerned with here,

6
7
S
9
10
11

I think it is typical of similar programs, is intended as the
testimony here shows to meet the needs that Westinghouse and
the AEC have for highly trained technical people to help them
recruit these people to keep them over a long period of time and
to keep them up to date on technical requirements of their job.
The program we are concerned with is broken into two

12

13
14

15

IS
17
13
19

phases?

The first one, which is called the work-study phase

has not given rise to any tax dispute, at least up to now.
It lasts for four years and it begins when the
employee is accepted by Westinghouse into this Bettis Program.
In the case of two of the respondents that occurred when they
agreed to work for Westinghouse? with the third respondent if
occurred sometime after he had come to work for Westinghouse.
During this four-year work-study phase the employee

20

holds down a regular job at the Bettis Laboratory and he attends
21

classes part time either at the University of Pittsburgh or
22
the Carnegie Institute of Technology, which I think since the
23

events in this case has become the Carnegie-Melion University.
24

Westinghouse pays the employee for 40 hours a week.
25

1

bat allows hira 8 hours weekly„ up to I think a total of 156

2

hours each year to go to class,
Westinghouse pays his tuition and fees during that

3
4

period,

5

supposed to have met his preliminary requirements for the

6

doctoral degree in engineering or science.

7

At the end of this four-year period the employee is

When all of his course work and his language studies

&

are finished and he has passed the qualification examinations

roffk on his discertation.
He receives a leave of absence if Westinghouse and
the ASC each approve the applicant — not all are approved —
and if Westinghouse and the AEC each approve his thesis topic
which is in the first instance approved by the University,
If he is granted leave, he then agrees to come back
to Westinghouse for some ——
Q

I beg your pardon, is it clearly understood that

they will approve his discertation subject only if it is
connected with the work of this particular plant?

I think your

brief indicates that.
A

I believe, Mr, Justice Portas, that testimony

that the testimony which is, as I recall, on this topic was a
representative of the AEC, was that they wanted the topic to
be work connected.
Now I think that has a broad scope and it certainly
5

3

does not mean a topic of current xise or of current concern to

2

the laboratory,, but I would suppose that it rather means a

3

topic that* by its nature* helps the man learn better how to

4

work on the problems at the laboratory„

3

Q

May I take it for granted* take it as not dis­

6

puted that the dissertation topic is a topic that is of com­

7

mercial interest to Westinghouse and official interest, to AEC

3

in terms of its governmental assignment?

9

A

I think* Mr. Justice Fortas* 1 would go too far

10

if I said that it was of immediate commercial value at the time

11

that it was performed.

12

It may or may not be.

I think that work connected was

13

used in a somewhat more general sense.

areas where the respondents had worked* generally speaking*

They were

The topics were approved by the AEC and Westinghouse.

19

There is apparently precedent for disapproval but it did not

happen with any of these three respondents.

Now in return for this leave the respondent agrees
to return to Westinghouse at Bettis for a minimum period of —

The record bears on that indirectly in showing

that Westinghouse on advice of their tax counsel withheld taxes
from this portion of the benefits.

answer is the contrary?

Well, certainly the record doesn't show that it

grants to these people in the same amounts you wouldn’t be here?

No, because the statute is very specific on

say, on it.
Q

But you would draw a distinction as between a

grant from a foundation and a grant from a company like this?
A

Yes, I would.

And ‘I would say that that is

supported by the expressions of opinion in the committee reports
that Congress did not want to exempt or didn't that it was
exemptive from tax what it called continuing salary payments
to an employee who was on leave from his regular job.
I really think that that legislative history is the
basic support for the regulations that we are relying on here.
The three respondents here were on leave at varying
timeg between 1960 and 1962.

Two of them for nine months, they

received $63(3 a month which is 80 percent of their prior
23
24

salaries and the third wone was on leave for a full year.

The laboratory is in Pittsburgh.

They are restricted to the choice of these two universities
to participate.
Q

Both of which are local?

A

They are both local and, of course, they have

been going to classes there for four years at least before they
take their leave.
Q

1 understood you to say that the employer company

paid all the tuition and fees and that you concede that that
was not taxable income?
A

I think that technically, Mr. Justice, that

might be includable in gross income but at. the same time they
would be given a deduction for it.
Q

Yes.

A

Under the Educational Expense Provision so it

would be a wash and there has been no dispute about that part
of the case.

real distinction between a ~™ or at least you don9t make the

2

distinction made by respondent between a scholarship and a

A

As we say in our reply brief, we understand that

distinction to rest on the idea that scholarship means degree

candidate and fellowship means nondegree candidate and we have

1

just found no support for that kind of distinction„

In

a grant to a undergraduate I think is always called a scholar­
ship,

A grant to somebody who is not seeking any kind of

degree is, I think, generally called a fellowship.
When you go to graduate students it could be either.

17
18

I would think it would come down to this.

The only definition that we found was in the catalog of MIT
which says that a scholarship to a graduate student means
something that just covers tuition and the fellowship to a
graduate student means something that covers tuition plus other
things„
Q

I thought that perhaps Congress meant the two

generically to be different.

That a scholarship was something

that was given to somebody who was in school at any level,
11

1

undergraduate or graduate level or even high school, and that

2

a fellowship grant,, a fellowship grant was and could be given

3

to somebody not — he might or might not be an academic person

4

but it didn't have anything to do with school, as such»

5

That is the respondent's submission, as I understand»

6

A

7

First, we don't understand that that has ever been

8
9
?0

11

I think our answer to it is two things»

the accepted understanding of tho.se words in any place, which
would lead us to think that if Congress had meant that rather
unusual distinction it would have been more direct in saying so.
And, 1 think the other answer really comes down to

12

why these regulations exist and perhaps I ought to turn to

13

those because this case, 1 think, focuses on the validity of

14
15
16
17
18
19

these regulations.
The statute really has no definition.

You are left

on this statute, I think, to infer from why the statute was
adopted and what Congress said about it, how this sort of case
ought to be resolved.
The Treasury, which has general rule-making power,

20

has sought to use that power to fill what is really an inter­

21

stice in the statute.

22
23x
24
25

These regulations that the Treasury has adopted were
accepted -as- the controlling legal theory by the District Judge.
They form the basis for instructions for rulings on evidence
and for that reason I think that the basis for the regulations
12

1

is the heart really of this case.
If those regulations are reasonable, if they are

2
3

rational interpretations of the statute, then we would suggest

4

.hat the Treasury has properly exercised its power in drawing

5

a rather hard line on what we would agree is a rather hard

S

case of statutory interpretation.
These regulations, if I can turn to their language,

7
8

start out with a general definition that says generally speaking

9

that a scholarship is an amount paid to allow a student to

50
1?

pursue studies.

studies or research.
If the regulations stop there this case would not

16
17
13

19
20
21

22
23

A fellowship to allow a student to pursue

have arisen because these payments would have qualified.

But

the dispute focuses on two exceptions that are in these regu™
lations.
Q

As I look at these regulations they do seam to

me superficially at least to make close to this distinction
by the respondent, forwhatever it is worth,

117-3 says a

scholarship is something which is given to a student whether
an undergraduate or a graduate and fellowship grant generally
means an amount paid or allowed to an individual to aid him
in the pursuit.
A

Of study or research.

Q

And one is a student and the other is an

24
individual.

There must be some reason for the difference in

25
.13

1

language
A

2

I think the reason is that an individual could

3

ba either»

4

believe that these regulations were intended in that sub™

5

paragraph (c) to not to apply to a student but rather the

6

word individual was used to encompass a student as well as

7

somebody who was not»

20

23
24

It could be a student or a nonstudant.

I don't

I think that that would agree with the general under­
standing of a fellowship which might be to a graduate student
or might not be»
The exceptions which are also set out in our Appendix
to these general definitions are twofold»
One says that a scholarship or fellowship does not
include amounts that represent compensation for past, present
or future employment services.
The second says that a scholarship or fellowship does
not encompass amounts that are paid to finance study or re­
search undertaken and the words are primarily for the benefit
of the grantor.
Both of these exceptions represent generalizations
of concerns Congress evidenced for things -that Congress did
when it was drafting this part of the Revenue Code.

This part

of the Code was a direct response to some very specific
problems that the Treasury had in years preceding 1954.
These were how to treat amounts paid research and

25

14

'i

teaching assistants and how to treat foundation grants to the

a

nonstudent,, often an established research or a professional

3

who wanted to continue his area of activity.
The only way of doing this before 1954 was to apply

4
5

concepts of gift.

And 39 Cod® is now, a gift was intended the

6

amount was not taxable.
Mow the difficulty with this was that it was a rather

7

8

anomalous approach.

S

to an established professional which is a reasonably substantial

10

As things worked out the foundation grant

amount, proceeds from what could be called the disinterested

11

generosities, so

12

students who were required to teach or do research are paid to

13

an employee so those are taxed.
This is a sensible interpretation of gift.

14
15
16
17

20
21

22
23
24
25

But in

feras of tax policy and in terms of what one might want to
exempt or not exempt it is questionable whether this makes
sense.
It was against this background that Section 117 was

18
19

it is a gift, the small amounts paid graduate

adopted.

It has in its first section, 117-^A, a general ex­

clusion ©£ amounts paid as scholarships or fellowships.

Then

117-B expressly deals with these two problems? 117-B-l deals
with the research assistant or teaching assistant and. it
expressly provides that amounts paid to that type of person
are to be taxed unless that person is performing duties, for
example, practice teaching, that are required cf all candidates
15

1

for the degree including those, of course, who would not have

a

fellowships or scholarships.,
Now in drafting these provisions Congress said two

3

things-

with here represent generalisations of what Congress said»

17

The parts of the regulations that we are concerned

In dealing with the nondegree candidates in estab­
lishing this $300 per month exclusion, both Houses of Congress
in their committee reports, said that they did not intend to
grant exclusions for amounts that could fairly be called
continuing payments of salary during a period when the recipient
is on leave from his regular job.
That is the language of the House report.
essentially repeated in the Senate report.

It is

The House did this

in the context of an objective formula which would have ex­
cluded fellowships only if the fellowship grant and the em­
ployee's compensation from a prior employer were less than 75
percent of this prior salary.
The Senate changed the formula but expressed the

18
same general idea.

The reason the Senate changed the formula

19
does not bear on this case.

It is because it was called to the

20

Senators attention that certain people, for example, people who
21

just got a medical degree and were being given a fellowship
22
would, under the House formula, have been taxed because they
23
had no real income before they started on their research or
24
post doctoral fellowship.
25
16

!

Now the part of the regulation that excludes from a

2

fellowship or a scholarship compensation from past, present or

3

future services we suggest has its direct antecedent in this

4

aspect of the legislative history,

5

,

Congress was quite clear that it did not want to

6

exempt payments of salary while the recipient is on leave from

7

his regular job.

8

Treasury Ms quite directly implemented that expression of

9

Congressional concern.

10

We suggest in this part of the regulation the

The second part of the regulation which speaks of the

1!

primary purpose of the grant comes out of the legislative

12

history of Section 117(b)(1) which taxes amounts paid to

13

teaching and research assistants.

14
15

IS
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

That exemption does not apply if the teaching or
research is required of everybody who is a candidate for the
degree even if he doesn't have a scholarship.

Congress in

explaining that dichotomy said it was drafting the statute so
that it would not tax a grant which involves research

or

teaching services performed primarily for the training and
education of the recipient.
So the second exclusion of the regulation finds its
direct antecedent in that portion of the legislative history.
So what, we have is a Treasury attempt to synthesise and give
expression to the general concerns that Congress showed in
drafting this statute.
17

There are several arguments made against us, both

1
2

by respondent and by the court below which I would like to deal

3

with very briefly.
Congress said that it was trying to avoid a case by

4
5

case inquiry into the existence of gift.

(3

suggested, and argued, that Congress was trying to avoid a

7

case by case inquiry into anything, even compensation.
We find no support for that in the legislative

history, none has ever been cited.

24

for

And this is the effect of the Treasury regulations
is to support that purpose.
The second point which I think is really at the basis

14
15

Congress rather made clear

arrangements escape tax.

12
13

From this it has been

of the Third Circuit opinion here, is the view that Congress
in Section 117 wanted to do everything it could to encourage
education and that the interpretation rendered below encourages
education.
That is true that Congress wanted to encourage edu­
cation through certain tax exempt incentives but that is not
the function of Section 117.
Congress' attempts to encourage education are in other
parts of the code in Section 501 which allows tax free foundaionstand educational institutions and in Section 170 which
allows deductions for donations to that sort of organization.

May I ask you this question?

Suppose an

"I want to take a year off to work on my doctoral thesis#" and

7

they said# "Well# that is fine# Westinghouse likes to encourage

its young people and we will give you a scholarship of say

So they just give him the $10#000»

Really what you are settled down to here is the

Yes, we rely on that bundle of facts and I think

that bundle is typical of the cases we have been litigating,,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C, LARRIMER, ESQ,

6

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

8

MR, LARRIMER;

May it please the Court,

9

If I may I would like to direct my initial comments

10

to the question proposed by Mr, Justice Fortas on the selection

11

of the thesis topic.

12

The section of the topic itself is confined to the

13

area in which this scholarship was granted and this is the

14

requirement of Westinghouse that it be in engineering field.

15

That is the broad limit of the topic itself.

The selection of

the thesis ——
Q

Well, the Government says something more

specific than that.

The Government says something much more

specific than that,
A

They say it, your Honor, yes,

Q

I haven^t had a chance to check into the record

but the Government says it has got to be connected with the —
it has to be relevant to the work program of the laboratory,
and you say the record does not support that?
A

The record does not support that.
20

The record,

1

the testimony of the witness was that it must be of general

2

interest and very general in nature I think are the exact

3

terms that were used by the witness.
The thesis topic is essentially a learning process

4
5

or a teaching process'.

The university has a condition of

6

granting the degree of the doctor of philosophy must be satis­

7

fied that these men have the ability to undertake what they

8

call original research.
They must first, select a topic and in selecting the

9
10

topic they must make a search of the records in order to

11

ascertain that this particular topic has not been researched

12

before.

13

faculty and the university for approval and after the selection

14

is approved, as constituting original research, then the

15

individual student is permitted to pursue his research in order

16

to secure an answer to the problem he has selected.

This selection must be made and submitted to the

Q

Well then the company does have the sright to

determine whether or not the proposal of the employee for a
thesis is to be permitted?
A

The program, yes, your Honor.

The program under

which the scholarship is granted states that the topic should
be of interest to Bettis, the Atomic Energy and it should be
submitted to them for approval.
Q

In other words he is not aentirely a free agent

to acquire a doctorate without regard to his work?
21

Supposing

1

Atomic Energy he wanted to write a thesis on English,

2

A

It would not he approved,

3

G

It would not be approved,

4

A

Because

5

G

Because there is no specific interest of the

8

company in that?
A

Wellff not for that reason» but for a different

8

reason and that is this?

these students are accepted under this scholarship program

That when these individuals, when

they are accepted as a candidate for a degree in the Department
at Engineering and Science and necessarily their thesis topic
must be involved with a topic which is in that department,
Q

Is that interest only as general as science,

anything in science whether it affected their work or not
'onid. be approved?
A

Yes,

Q

Of necessity they would have to approve it?

A

No, the program does not say that.

The program

can be terminated at any time by Westinghouse for any reason.
There is no vested interest in this student in continuation of
the program.

Westinghouse has a right to continua or to dis­

continue. it at any time for whatever reason they choose.
But the testimony in the court below was that it had
to be in engineering and it could be of very general nature,
related to the Westinghouse or Bettis Atomic Laboratory, which.
22

i

of course, was involved with engineering principles and

z

scientific principles *

3

Now the Government's premise, which is stated through­

4

out its brief, and is stated unequivocally, is that Congress

5

plainly intended that the view that the exclusion would not

6

apply to grants that are in effect merely payments of a salary

7

during a period while the recipient is on leave from his

8

regular job.

9

This statement is repeated again and again.

It is

10

repeated again on page 9 of their brief, it is repeated again

11

on page 12, repeated again on page 18, and on page 21, page 30,

12

page 4 and 8 of the reply brief.

13

Now, I suggest to this court that this statement is

14

not supported by a legislative history.

15

to that aspect of it, in the backdrop of this case
