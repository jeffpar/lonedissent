ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN C. AMAKER, ESQ.

1

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

8
9

MR. AMAKER:

May it please the Court, this case on

appeal here from a three-judge court for the Eastern District

10

of Virginia presents two issues of first impression in this

11

Court.

12

On® is constitutional, end the other is

statutory,

13

respecting the right of illiterates, who, as a result of

14

the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, became eligible

IS

to vote for the first time in Virginia and elsewhere, to cast

16

a secret ballot for the candidate of their choice and to

17

have that ballot counted for their candidate just as every

18

other qualified voter in the State of Virginia.

19

The constitutional question is whether these

20

illiterates,who by the last census were more than three par

21

cent of the persons in Virginia^over fourteen years of age,

22

can, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, be barred

23

from the Equal Protection Clause of that amendment and be

24

barred from protecting their right to a secret ballot by

25

use of a gummed sticker bearing the name of the candidate
2

1

of their choice in the face of a Virginia statute requiring

2

that any write-in vote be in the voter's own handwriting.

3

The statutory issue is whether the handwriting

4

provision of this statute,which is Virginia Code, Section

5

24-252, the text of which is at page 2 of our brief and at

6

page 68a _ of the appendix, is a test or device prohibited

7

by subsection 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act,

8

text of that section is at page 5, and begins at page 5 of

9

our brief.

10

The complete

Our contention on the constitutional issue is

It

that the Equal Protection Clause is violated because illiterate;;

12

who want to cast a write-in vote without disclosing the

13

nature of that vote to state officials are prevented from

14

doing so, while Virginia has provided for the protection of

15

the secrecy of the ballot for other classes of voters„
On the Voting Rights Act issue, we assert the

IS
17

refusal to count the illiterates' write-in ballots which

18

occur here is a denial of the right to vote as defined in

19

the Voting Rights Act of 1965, by using a prohibited test

20
21

X or device.
Now, at the threshold, because this Court postponed

22

decisions as to jurisdiction, is the question of the Court's

23

jurisdiction to decide these issues on this appeal.

24
25

The appeal, of course, is based on 28 USC Section
1253, in that the appeal is from an order denying a
3

i

permanent injunction in a civil action required to be heard

t

and determined by the District Court of three judges.

3

The argument that the case is one that is required

4

to be heard by a three-judge court is of course based on

5

28 USC Section 2281.

6
7

The argument is in our brief beginning at page 23.
In Siam it is as follows s

8
&

First, -that 28 USC

Section 228.1

requires a three-

judge court to hear a ease seeking an injunction against

10

the enforcement of a state statute on the ground of its

11

unconstitutionality.

12

sents to the District Court here.

i3

That is the claim that appellant pre­

Second, it met the formal requirements for invoking

14

the three-judge court jurisdiction — the single district

15

judge who received the application for the three-judge court

16

acted routinely on the application, and indeed the three-

17

judge court itself never raised any question as to its juris­

18

diction .

13
20

It proceeded to decide the case on the merits of
both the constitutionality and the statutory issue.

21

Fourth, the appellees never raised any question

22

as to jurisdiction in the District Court, and I could not

23

understand their brief in this Court to be raising any ques­

24

tion as to jurisdiction now.

25

Certainly, the constitutional question is a
4

1

substantial one, it is one of first impression, and conse­

2

quently it has not been foreclosed by any prior decisions

3

of this Court.

4

The inclusion of the statutory claim under the

S

Voting Rights Act did not operate to divest the three-judge

8

court of the jurisdiction that it acquired as a consequence

7

of appellants8 constitutional claim.

8
9

Finally, what is obvious, Virginia Code, Section
24-252, is a statute of statewide applicability in Virginia,

10

and so there is no question of dealing with a statute on

n

the local application.

12

We also join in our brief in arguments beginning

13

at page 28 an alternate jurisdictional ground under the

14

Voting Rights Act, but it seems ‘that the constitutional

15

basis for the jurisdiction of the three-judge court is

16

sufficient and/with the Court3s permission, I would like

17

to pass on to the merits.

18
19
20

Turning to the merits, I think, it is important to
state a couple of propositions.
First, the Court is not being asked to rule on the

21

question of whether the Fourteenth Amendment prevents the

22

state from barring the use of stickers by all segments of

23

the electorate at any time.

24
25

To the extent that the state courts, a handful of
them, have dealt with that question, the majority view had
5

1

upheld the right to use stickers, and those cases are cited

2

both in our brief and in the brief of the appellees*
Nor is the Court being asked to deal with the

3

4

question of whether Virginia would have a right to set a

S

voter qualification, because the effect of the Voting Rights

6

Act on this proceeding was to enfranchise illiterates, and

7

so the real question before this Court is one of the State’s

8

responsibility toward illiterates who are qualified voters

8

with respect to two areas*
First there is the preservation of the secrecy

10
11

of their ballot, and, second, with rtsspecfc to fcha assurance,

12

the certainty to them, that the ballot will be counted for

13

the candidate of their choice, thus preserving their right

14

to choose*
Now these issues arise out of the following circum

'IS
16

stances§

17

Samuel Tucker, a well-known Negro civil rights

IS

lawyer, was running as a write-in candidate for Congress

19

in the last Congressional election, in 1966, from Virginia’s

20

Fourth Congressional District*

21

22
33
24

25

Now the Fourth Congressional District of Virginia
is in an area that is commonly called southside Virginia,
and it is an area in which there exists the largest black
population in the State, and also the largest percentage of
the State’s illiterates*
6

1

The last census indicated, that of parsons over

2

fourteen years of age in that district, approximately 94,000

3

were persons who were illiterate»

4

Q

That was over fourteen?

5

A

I am sorry»

The figure I gave you was for

8

the State of Virginia at large,, the State as a whole.

7

Fourth Congressional District had 22,9 of persons over 25

8

years of age who were illiterates.

9

The

On the ballot were listed two white candidates,

10

the incumbent, Mr. Watkins Abbott, who had been, to that

11

point, serving the Congress for twenty years, since the csGth

12

Congress, and his opponent, the Republican candidate, Mr.

13

Silverman.

14

Mr. Tucker who had run in the previous Congressional

15

election and who was then listed on the ballot did not qualify

16

in time for his name to foe listed on the ballot in this

17

election, and lie was later urged to run as a write-in

18

candidate by his supporters who were in the main degrees who

19

wanted no part of either candidate who was listed on the

20

ballot»

21

Now, they sought to maximize the vote for Tucker

22

by inclusion of this relatively substantial number of newly

23

enfranchised illiterates who, as the District Court found,

24

were, and 1 think this language is of soma significance,

25

who were registered voters but who were unable to spell
7

\

z
3

4

accurately or to write legibly»
Now, would you consider the choice -that confronted
these persons in these situations.
One, of course, was not to vote at all.

Second,

S

of course, was to vote for somfeone whose name was on the

6

ballot that they didn't want.

7

their vote to white state election officials who, pursuant

8

to Virginia law, are appointees of the dominant political

9

parties in the State, in an area like soufchside Virginia,

And, third, it was to disclose

10

an area which includes Prince Edward County, which is familiar

11

to this Court from prior litigation, an area in which they

VZ

could anticipate the kinds of things that the Civil Rights

13

Commission report has highlighted and, indeed, the kinds

14

of things that resulted in the passage of the Voting Rights

15

Act in the first place.

16

So to solve -the dual problem of being able to

17

exercise a choice, but at the same time trying to keep that

18

choice hidden from the dominant whit© political apparatus

19

which had opposed for decades the participation of black

20

members of the electorate, they used what to them was a

21

very simple means of having printed, gummed stickers, just

22

the form that I am illustrating here, which is Plaintiff's

23

Exhibit Number 1, which simply said, "S„ W. Tucker", the

24

point being that the illiterate person when he went to the

25

polls could simply put that on the ballot, fold his ballot
8

t

and in accordance with the Virginia procedure hand it to

1

the election official to deposit in.the

Now, the proposition that is urged by Virginia is

3
4

ballot box.

that the use of stickers is, per se„ invalid.
Apparently, in reading the District Court's opinion,

S
6

that court thought that, this was a central issue in the case

7

and that the Virginia Legislature had forbidden their use

8

in toto.

9

But I think this, of course, misses the point,

10

which is that once these persons were enfranchised by the

II

Voting Rights Act of 1965, it became Virginia's responsibility

12

to provide some means for assuring fcha secrecy and the cer­

13

tainty of the ballot among all of its qualified voters.

14

In fact, Virginia has, and prior to the 1965

15

Voting Rights Act, mads accommodations with respect to these

16

qualities with respect to other classes of voters.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Virginia's constitution, itself, guarantees the
right of secrecy of a ballot, and there are several other
provisions in the State's Code, all of which fix on the
importance of keeping the ballot secret.
But Virginis has not done this in the case of these
illiterates.

Rather, among all of the voters who are quali­

fied, it has set up classes of voters and discriminated among
them both with respect ©t the question of the secrecy of the
ballot, with respect to assurance to the voters that the
9

1

vote will in fact be counted for the candidate of his choice*

a

and in an additional respect* too* particularly as regards

3

illiterates* Virginia has made it easier for the illiterate

4

to vote for a candidate whose name is listed on the ballot*

5

but it has discriminated with respect to an illiterate who

8

chooses to vote for a candidate 'who is running a write-in

7

campaign,
0

6
9

But the Virginia statute does try to make an

j

j

effort to insure the secrecy of the ballot of a write-in

10

by placing the judge who presumable knows* making it incumbent j

11

upon him to have some confidentiality of what the voter does*

12

and make it a crime if he doesn't* isn't that right?
That is not entirely right* Mr«Justice Forfcas.

13

h

14

First of all* there is no Virginia

statute ifhich

15

does that.

What you have reference to is a bulletin which

16

was sent by the secretary of the.State Board of Elections

17

to all of the judges of election in October of 1965«

18

Defendant's Exhibit 4,

19

Q

It is

I was talking about 24-251 of the Virginia

20

Code* but your point is that that does not apply to an

2?

illiterate except by virtue of the subsequent.directive?

22
23
24
25

A

That is right,

Q

Thank you,

h

So the question is what about the illiterates

who desire to cast write-in votes as did the appellants
10

1

here when it is obvious that under the State9s own categories

2

that they set up for protecting the secrecy of the vote

3

they are the least, favored class.

4

differences are.

5

Let us see what these

With respect to each of the three things which I

6

think are extremely important here* the question of secrecy*

7

and the question of what 1 call certainty* or surety that the

8

vote will in fact he cast for the person that the person

9

intends it to ba cast for* and with respect to the ..difference

10

between voting for a listed candidate as opposed to a write-in

11

candidate.

„

12

Wow* of course

the literate voter is fully pro­

13

tected on all of these scores.

14

machine or whether it is a ballot* he can vote in~ ab1solute

15

secrecy* and he can* himself* assure that his vote is cast

16

for the candidate of his choice* and there is no discernible

17

problem between voting for a candidate whose name is on

18

the ballot as opposed to writing in a name* except the

19

small amount of inconvenience that it takes to write the

20

name.

21

Whether it is a voting

The statute that Mr. Justice Fortas referred to*

22

24* Section 251* is reproduced in our brief at page 3.

It

23

sets up other categories with voters vaho in some sense have

' to be singled out for special treatment * and let us see what
j
Virginia has done with them.
25

24

11

1

First, there is a category of a blina voter»

2

Now, obviously, because the blind voter is under

3

disability, Virginia has taken some steps to assure capacity

4

for him to make his vote effective in all of these ways that

5

I have indicated.

6

a special

But what it has done is to say that the blind

7

voter can be assisted in casting his vote, either a write-in,

3

or a voting for someone listed, by a person of his own selec­

9

tion.

10

That person, of course, can be a trusted friend.
It has done one additional thing.

It has provided

11

criminal sanctions to enforce the right of the blind voter

12

to secrecy, the right of the blind voter to make sure that

13

his ballot is, in fact, cast for the person that he intended

14

it to be cast for.

IS

Now the physically handicapped voter is one who

16

can be assisted only by an election judge which he can desig­

17

nate, and there are criminal sanctions as in the case of a.

18

blind voter.

19

to do then, even though he is protected with respect to

20

being himself physically to see how his vote is cast, so

21

that he can himself determine whether in fact the vote is

22

being cast for the person that he intended, he has to give

23

up some measure of the secrecy.

But what the physically handicapped voter has

24

But again there is a sanction.

25

The same applies to that small category of persons
12

1

2

^orn before 1904, persons who would be over 80 years of age,
|

persons who were registered before 1904.

3
4

S |
6
7
8

9
10
11
12

But the illiterate, under Virginia law as it
presently stands, must first sacrifice his secrecy to a
state official that he. chooses to vote in accordance with
the election vote.

There is no criminal sanction to enforce

his right of secrecy as opposed to the state election
official.

He has no assurance, both because he is very much

like the blind voter, he cant see how the ballot is being
marked and because there is no criminal sanction, he has no
real assurance that the vote is going to be cast for the
candidate that he intended it to be cast for, and he suffers

13

also a substantial discrimination with respect to his capacity

14

to vote for a write-in candidate as opposed to a listed

15

candidate.

16

What we have called in our brief this crazy quilt

17

of classification has been condemned by this Court in a

18

variety of ways under the Fourteenth JhnendinentT~~'

19

We have cited some of those cases in our brief.

20

There is the Harrington case, and the Skinner v„ Oklahoma

21

case, and others.

22

Q

But 1 notice in the bulletin sent to state

23

judgescf election, on page 15 of your brief, there is an

24

admonition that the judge of elections shall assist the

25

voter upon his request, and shall not in any manner divulge
13

1

or indicate the name or names of the person for whom any

2

voter shall vote.

3
4

Is it your point that there is no sanction behind
that?

5

A

Yes.

8

Q

There is nothing provided in the law to

7

enforce that?

8
9

A

There is no sanction} and the Equal Protection

point, of course, is with respect to the other classes of

10

voters, all of whom, like the illiterates, are qualified

11

persons,,

12

Q

1 understand,, but I was talking about this

13

specific question, is there anything in Virginia law that

14

authorises the State Board of Elections to issue something

15

like this and if there is, does that provision of Virginia

16

law provide any sanction?

17

A

1 know of none.

Virginia says that the

18

reason for the issuance of the election bulletin,which is

19

clear, was the passage of the Voting Rights Act.

20

Virginia, as did several other states prior to the

21

passage of that, made no provision for illiterates at all.

22

It obviously, particularly as a consequence of this Court8s

23

decision in Lassiter,felt it was under no obligation.

24

25

When the Act was passed in 1965, Virginia for the
first time tried to accommodate itself to the new requirements,

14

1

and this electoral bulletin is the result.

2

That is deficient

in several respects but the most important respect, it seems

3

to me, in addition to the fact that there is no sanction, is

4

the fact that even assuming the sanction 'the other very

5

important consideration, very important at least in the

6

minds of the persons who attempted to use the stickers in

1

this election, is the fact that they would nevertheless

8

have to divulge the nature of their vote to a state election

9

official.
{

10

So the electoral bulletin really doesn’t meet that
f
aspect of the problem.

??
fl2

G

13

Well, what it does do, doesn't it, is include

illiterate people in that group covered by Section 24-251?

14

A

I am not sure it does.

I think that is what

IS

it attempts to do.

m

certainly in terms of the last election that nobody who

17

voted at that time knew anything about this.

18

the first time anybody heard about it, when it was introduced

19

22
23
24
25

I think it is interesting to note that

This bulletin,

and whan it was raised in the brief that was filed in the

20
21

j

District Court, in response to a motion for summary judgment.
'

Q

That was about two years ago, the election

two years ago?
A

Yes, the election was two years ago, but the

bulletin had been issued in October of the previous year.
Q

I suppose whether or not there was authority
15

\

1

to do it is probably a matter of state law.

2

tells us that it is a matter of state law, that is probably

3

the answer, isn8t it?

4

A

If Virginia

I dont think that that is the answer insofar

S

as you have to give up a very substantial part of your

6

secrecy to a voting official.

7

Q

So doe© anybody else who is physically unable

8

to prepare his ballot without aid, so you may be right,

9

but it is hardly an equal protection claim except insofar

10

as those people approach it differently from blind people.

11

A

I think the closest approximation, if you are

12

going to make one, is to the persons who are blind.

13

illiterate, like the blind person, is incapable of really

14

seeing the ballot in terms of making sure his wishes are

15

being carried out.

16

is broader than that,

17

The

But it seems to me idle responsibility

The responsibility is not to do the very least

18

but to do the very most to assure that the ballot is secret

13

for everyone.

20

has failed.

21

Q

I think it is in that respect that Virginia

What Virginia has prohibited is the use of

22

stickers to anybody, illiterate or literate, handicapped

23

or unhandicapped, and blind ©r not blind.

24

Virginia can use a sticker.

25

A

That is not entirely sure.
16

Wo voter in

1

is what they claim in this case, but the claim is as a conse­

quence of the statute that is under attack, and the addi­

tional argument

It was the Attorney General's opinion,,

5

A

They have raised the Attorney General3s

opinion, whatever effect that has.

we are challenging is one that was suspended by the Voting

3

Rights Act of 1965, and they so indicate,

it is correct to state that Virginia has prohibited the use

The Virginia statute that

of stickers.
But if you recall, I did not cast the issue in

that narrow focus.

question of whether Virginia,consistent with the .Equal

.14

Protection Clause, has fulfilled its responsibility to make

15

sure that these illiterates have the right to a secret

16

ballot, and also have the right to somehow be certain that

17

18

or write-in candidate, that that vote will be effective,

ARGUMENT OF R. D. McILWAXNE, III

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES :

3

MR. McILWAINEg

Mr. Chief Justice, as counsel for

5

should like to establish at the outsat, if I may, just what

this case involves,,

7

Perhaps the best way to do that is t© call atten­

8

tion to the opening paragraph of the court's opinion below,

§

and which contains all of the operative facts out of which

W

this case arose.
In four brief sentences the court below has stated

It

the entire case presented by the plaintiffs in the trial

are registered voters who are unable to spell accurately

15

or write legibly, who attempted to cast a write-in ballot

16

in the 1966 Congressional elections in the Fourth District

M

of Virginia.

18

It was to the effect in sentence on® that plaintiffs

Second, each one attempted to do this by pasting

19

on the official ballot a sticker in which the name of a

20

write-in candidate had been printed and voting for the name

21

printed on the sticker.

22
23
24

Third, these ballots were not tabulated

in the

official returns for the write-in candidate.
The fourth sentence begins, "Upon these undisputed
facts, the Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that rights
18

1

secured to them by the Fourteenth Amendment

2

tion of the United States and the Voting Rights Act of 1965

3

have been denied.”

4

of the Constitu­

Now, we submit that the only question that can be

5

raised by that set of facts is whether cr not. the refusal

6

of the Virginia election officials pursuant to Virginia law

7

to count these votas which were cast by means of labels and

6

stickers or pasters violated some right secured to -illiterates

fi

in the Fourth District of Virginia, a right secured by the

fO

Fourteenth Amendment or by -the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

11

We know full well that the Fourteenth Amendment

12

to the Constitution of the United’ States does not secure

13

that right

14

teenth Amendment per se does not even secure to an illiterate

15

the right to vote at all, much less to select the means by

IS

which he will vote.

17

to anyone else in the United States.

The Four-

The cases are perfectly clear that the matter of

18

whether or not stickers and pasters shall be permitted as

19

an appropriate means of voting is a matter to be determined

20

by each individual State,and regardless'of whether the State
!

21

prmits it or rejects it, neither determination of that question

22
23

is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The case in the Seventh Circuit and the case of

Morris versus Forts on,

25

So the assertion of the plaintiffs on this matter

3

is that of all of the people in the United States

4

as illiterates have the right to vote with stickers,

they alone

!

5

Q

How could the vote be secret otherwise?

8

A

1 don8t know how it could be secret otherwise s

7

but 1 am of the opinion, as the lower court'is, that they

13

are not entitled to a secret ballot,

9

Q

I was just wondering if the elected official

10

wrote

?!

booth., he could tell the difference between handwriting

12

and printing, he,could vote,

the name, and the illiterate person took it in the

13

A

He could do that under Virginia law.

He is

14

simply requested to furnish him assistance and to insure that

15

his ballot is marked in accordance with the way he wants it.

16

There is no requirement --

17

Q

No, my point is all the official does is to

18

write in the name of Joe Doe, and then the voter takes that

19

ballot in by himself without the official, and he puts an

20

X, which he can do, either in front of a printed name or

21

the handwritten name, by himself without anyone seeing what

22

he does,

23

A

That could be dona, if Your Honor please.

2,4

Of course the secrecy of the ballot would be compromised in

25

any event, to 'the extent that he carries a ballot to an
20

1

election official and asks him to write Joe Doe’s name on it.

2

Q

How can he do it then in a secret manner?

3

A

I don’t understand that he can* and I don’t

4

understand that he is required or entitled to complete

5

secrecy of the ballot either by the Fourteenth Amendment

6

or the Voting Rights Act.

7

Q

How about the Constitution of Virginia?

8

A

Only to the extent that regulations issued

9

by the General Assembly of Virginia statutes pursuant to

10

Section 36 of the Virginia Constitution state that; in order

11

t©

!2

shall enact laws governing the conduct of elections.

A

Thikt is also in the Constitution* Your Honor*

in Section 26.
It would not apply to anyone who was physically

18

handicapped or educationally handicapped.

clear* the secrecy of the ballot* of the physically handi­

20

As -the cases make

There is no

Except that you treat the Hind differently

from the illiterate.
A

If Y'our Honor please* there are two things.

Every state treats the blind differently, and every state
21

1

2

has different methods of solving the problem of what you are
going to do with the physically handicapped.

3

Q

Do you think the Equal Protection Clause is

4

a substantial question in the case, or are you objecting to

5

the jurisdiction?

6

A

No, we do not object to the jurisdiction of

7

•the three-judge court with respect to whether or not they

8

have a right to cast that ballot by means of stickers or

9

pasters, which was the only operative fact in this case.

10
11

Q

So fctee was a aubr.taniiaX Equal Protection

Clause with respect to the three-judge court?

12

A

I think in viewing the complaint, the assertion

13

that the Virginia statute as it then stood forbade them to

14

cast their ballots by this method and the prayer for relief

15

was attempting to enjoin it, to require the voter to cast

16

hi3 write-in vote in his own handwriting, was sufficient for

17

the District Judge in scanning that complaint to think that

18

the question was not entirely clear and to call for a three-

19

judge court.

20
21

Q

The only issue in the lower court was the

validity of the statute requiring handwriting?

22

A

With respect to stickers or pasters on the

23

ballot.

24

I did not know that this was a race case.

25

word Negro in the complaint.

In other words, until this case was argued here,
I don't find the

I don't find it in the court's
22

1

opinion.

It is not.

It is a simple question of illiterates,

2

and in the lower court it was simply argued that these persons

3

were functionally illiterate without regard to race or color,

4

5

Q

Well, would Section 4 of the Voting Rights

Act, was that involved?

6

A

Ho, sir.

The only argument made on the Voting

7

Rights Act was the tost or device proposition, and -that in

8 i

requiring the individual to cast the ballot in his own hand­

9

writing that constituted a device,

10

Q

And it was suspended?

11

A

Yes, but that, was admitted, if Your Honor

12

please, and so there was no controversy on that in the

13

lower court.

14

Q

And there still isn’t?

15

Q

And the statute was suspended?

16

A

And within a week after the enactment of the

17

Voting Rights Act of 1965, the State Board of Elections

18

and the Attorney General of Virginia together issued a

19

bulletin.

20

Elections which flatly states, which Your Honors will find

21

in the record, the Voting Rights Act had superseded in s©

22

many words the Virginia statute requiring people to register

23

to vote in their own handwriting and directing the registrars

24

in Virginia to register people who were illiterate and couch­

25

ing that regulation almost verbatim in the form of a Civil

Actually it was issued by the State Board of

23

1

Service regulation issued to federal examiners to guide

2

them in the method by which they would enroll illiterate

3

voters in States affected by the Act.

4

Then three weeks before the election, another

5

bulletin was issued in which the election officials were

6

instructed to assist illiterate voters in casting their

7

ballots end broadening the provisions of the Virginia statute,

8

which had heretofore limited assistance only to the physically

9

handicapped, to include the illiterate.

10

11
12

Q

.Are you going to address yourself to the

Memorandum filed by the Solicitor General?
A

Only in the few remaining minutes of my

13

argument, I had intended to touch upon it, but I am perfectly

14

content to come to it now.

15

Initially significant with respect to that is the

16

fact that the Solicitor General do©3 not have one line in it

17

which contains a hint that he was even remotely or con­

18

ceivably supporting -the position stated by the appellants

19

in this case.

20

Q

Do you challenge or do you contest the point

21

•that that issue is before us, or is it your position that

22

that issue is not properly before us?

23

A

Well, of course I take the position, Your

24

Honor, that the issue is not properly before you because it

25

was not raised as an issue in this case, and it was not passed.
24

1

upon by the trial court.

2

this, the ultimate,level of appellate review by the Solicitor

3

General.

4

So that issue is one injected at

Of course, it is before the Court in the sense

5

that the Court invited the Solicitor General to express his

6

views, and he has, and we do not object to filing a response

,

to it or to stating our position.

8

to •—

The only thing we object

9

Q

You don't raise the jurisdictional question?

10

A

No, sir, but we do object to this, and on

11

this we wish to be perfectly clear, and we do object to the

12

Solicitor General trying to turn this case, which was a

13

straight case involving a question of whether or not a person

14

could vote by means of a sticker or paster, into a case in

15

which a complaint had been filed alleging that election

SG

officials had engaged in discriminatory practices and pro­

17

posed to continue in those practices unless an injunction

18

was issued under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, requiring

19

them to register illiterates or fco otherwise giv© up practices

20

which had obtained prior to the enactment of the Voting

21

Rights Act of 1965.
Non© of those practices have ever obtained in

22
23

Virginia.

24

has any relevance to a citizen's right to vote.

25

Virginia has never taken the position that race

we

took the position for years that race had a
25

1

great deal to clo with the right of a person to attend a

2

school or to marry, and those issues have been litigated

3

and decided by this Court*

4

But Virginia has never taken the position that

5

race has any relation to that, and we object most strenuously

6

t© any attempt to remand this case to the District Court

7

to enable the plaintiffs to make a new case of it at the

8

District level*

9

Q

However that may be, the Solicitor General

10

suggests to this Court that the bulletin issued by the

I?

Board of Elections constitutes a practice ©r procedure with

12

respect to voting different

13

on November 1, 1964, and therefore the Solicitor urges that

14

this could not be used, or that directive of the Election

15

Board could not be used without first being submitted to

16

the Attorney General or the United States District Court

17

for the District of Columbia,

from that in force or in affect

18

It may be that w© have to consider a point of law

19

that he raises some way or another, that is to say, whether

20

this is or it is not a practice or procedure with respect

21

to voting different from that in force on November 1, 1964,

22

If it is, perhaps we have to consider whether its

23

further use should be enjoinedpending the clearances pro»

£4

vided by the Voting Rights Act of 1965,

25

A

Well, of course, the Solicitor General does
26

1

males that assertion, Mr, Justice Fort as , and of course the

2

Court can consider it.

3

up on this appeal, and it is not a question raised by the

4

jurisdictional statement, and it is a question inserted

5

by the Solicitor General in this Court.

6

It is not a part of the record brought

Now, in envisioning the possibility that the Court

7

would consider the argument, w@ have stated why we feel

S

that it cannot possibly b© correct that the bulletins issued

9

in. this case were a practice or procedure within the meaning

10

of Section 5a, and it is so obvious to us that it cannot

11

be that we do not see how there can be two sides to the

12

question.
If it was a practice or procedure, it would mean

13
14

that when the Voting Rights Act became effective in Virginia

15

on August 7, 1965, there was nothing that the Virginia elec­

16

tion officials could do about it except continue to violate

17

it.
This bulletin was issued within a week of the

18
19

Voting Rights Act becoming effective, and it told the

20

Virginia election officMs that the Voting Sights Act was

21

then in force in Virginia, and despite the provisions of

22

Virginia law which d© not permit illiterates to register,

23

you are to begin to register.
Under the Solicitor General's argument, vie couldn’t

24
25

do that.
27

1

Mow suppose we had never written the regulation?

2

Suppose we had waited ten months to write it?

3

supposed to happen to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in

4

Virginia in the interim?

5

What is

If we cannot enforce a bulletin which says that

6

those instructions implement the Voting Rights Act of 1965«

7

The Voting Rights Act superseded the provisions of Virginia

8

law which forbid illiterates to register and forbid them

9

to vote^ and you are now required by the prevailing super­

10

vening federal law to register illiterates.

11

even before South Carolina against Kafcssenbach was filed in

12

this Court, and it prevailed, and illiterates were being

13

registered in Virginia and being voted in Virginia, in

14

conferovantion of Virginia law while Sluth Carolina case was

15

being argued.

16
'17

We did that

As a matter of fact, we issued those bulletins
in 1965, and we passed through the general election of 1965

18

without a murmur, and we continued for another year, and we

19

have still had no difficulty with it until the question of

20

voting for Mr. S. W,Tucker by means of a. sticker or paster

21

in fell© .1966 Congressional elections arose.

22
23
24
25

Q

Mr. Mcllwaina, you agree that the Civil

Rights Act of 1965 was concerned with illiterates?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

Do you £,§x©© that the Commonwealth of Virginia
28

did take action in the form of a memorandum dealing with the
question of how illiterates may vote after the Act?

20

should have teen submitted to the Attorney General of the

21

United States?

22

A

|

That is correct.

That is our position.

23

Under the facts in this case, if that is so, then there were

24

a number of illiterates voted at the 1965 election who

25

would not have if we be required to submit that matter to

the Attorney General and wait for sixty days for him to

2

express his opinion.

Q

That is not before us?

A

The whole question is not before you,

Your Honor.

6

Q

If Virginia lias put out a regulation that

7

illiterates may hereafter vote and may vote by a sticker,

8

they may vote by a sticker but no other way, you would say

9

'that is implementing the Voting Rights Act?
A

10

Ho, sir.

I submit that if that is put out,

11

I submit at anytime after the passage of the Voting Rights

12

Act, the Legislature should amend its election laws, under

13

the Voting Rights Act they are superficially at least re­

14

15
16

them are, and they are permitted to be enforced, even

17

though they hair© not been officially avowed or disavowed by

18

the Attorney General.
But I am submitting to Your Honors that these

19
20

instructions which were issued immediately after the Act

21

became effective,implementing the Act, were not such in­

22

structions as were required to be submitted to the Solicitor

to the Solicitor General,

He can say, "We are sorry, we cannot help you.

4

We are in the process of getting together a regulation for

5

the registration of illiterates and the voting of illiterates.

8

When we get it together, there ia still nothing that we

7

can do, and we have to submit it to the Attorney General,

After that we have to wait sixty days, and if an election

be that someone should have authority meanwhile to prescribe

The law reads if there

Now, there have been a number of cases, y©s,

ii

in which this issue has been raised in Louisiana, in Georgia,

12

in Alabama, and in Mississippi.

13

the relief granted by the District Court sitting in those

14

cases, so far as illiterates are concerned has bean to

15

require the local election officials to assist the illiterates,!

16

and specific provision has been made.

In each of those casas,

t

17

Non© of those cases permit anyone other than an

18

election official to assist the illiterate in casting his

19

vote, though in those States the physically handicapped

20

or the blind may be helped by a member of their family or

21

a person of their choice.

22

In fch© cases which we had catalogued in our brief,

23

the United Statas against Mississippi, Morris against Fortson,

24

United States against Executive Committee, and United States

25

against Louisiana, the relief granted by Federal District

32

1

Courts under the Vot.vrg Rights Act of 1965 is limited to

a

permitting only election officials to aid the illiterate

3

who have been en£ranch\ sec by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ,

4

Specifically in United States against Louisian®

5

that was true, and the court added that nothing contained

6

in this order shall affect my of the State provisions

7

relating to the casting of votes by the physically handi­

8

capped or the blind.

9

At that time the physically handicapped and the

10

blind were not permitted to be aided by election officials

11

but could take a friend of their chMce if they were blind

12

or if they were otherwise physically handicapped, a member

13

of their family.

14

Yet, when the decree was entered in that case,

13

assistance to illiterate voters was limited by the court

18

solely t© election officials aiding the voters, and that is

17

true in each of the four cases which are mentioned in the

18

Solicitor General's memorandum and which we have analysed

19

in our brief.

20

Now we cannot believe that the Attorney General

21

©£ Virginia is required to outdo just wisdom, Judge Quisenberry,

22

and judge© of the Fifth District, and go on t© say you can

23

d© it by a sticker,

24

0

It may be that that question is not before us.

Maybe we have two possibilities before us, and one is to

33

direct ourselves to the constitutionality of the requirement

2

that the vote be cast in the voter’s own handwriting, or,

3

two, that w© have to consider whether the Voting Rights

4

Act requires that tills new plan ©r new arrangement be pre­

Yes, Your Sonor, but you would not delay

reaching the question of whether or not Vlrgfei&’s retirement

You don’t reach the requirement because it isn’t there.

But 1 gather you have the question only of

19

the use of stickers being before us, and that isn3t necessarily

20

true, only in the case of the illiterates»

21

A

It is only in illiterates because that is the

22

only class represented here.

23

in here or any racial classifications.

illiterates, that is the only class that is her©»

Q

Physically handicapped are not
It is only th®

But the question is, I take it it is the same
36

1

question as you put it, this ways

2

or not it is unconstitutional for Virginia to permit

3

illiterates to vote with the help of election officials,

4

h

The question is whether

Yes, or without the means of stickers or

5

pasters,

6

euased this case to arise was the fact that these votes were

7

cast in this manner and were not counted.

8
0

That, you see, is the question.

The action

The action which

.that is challenged is whether or not

that failure of the election officials to count these votes

10

cast by means of stickers or pasters violates some rights

n

secured by the Equal Protection Clause,

12

suggested that anyone else be permitted to vote by stickers.

13

There is no question ©f discrimination hare at all.

14

There is nothing

I would simply point out, there is no evidence

15

on the part of Virginia, so far as the persons who may

16

render assistance is concerned with respect to the individual

17

plaintiffs in this case, and the most recent publication of

18

the State Board of Elections containing the instructions for

19

the coming November 5 election have again been broadened,

20

sine® this case, to permit the illiterate to b@ classified

21

with the blind and request the assistance of the judge of

22

elections or take in a person of his own choosing.

23

Until this case got to this Court, we didn't know

24

that there was some issue of the power structure or bomb

25

racial overtones t© the case, which was certainly not clear
37

i

in the pleadings and not clear in ;he court's opinion»
But the most recent regulation published by the

State Bos... "d of Elections have bee:,. drawn to permit the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN C. AMAKER, ESQ.

15
16

And

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. AMAKERj

The only response to this most

17

recent revelation we have, that is,the change in the bulletin

18

is one which obviously was timed to anticipate apparently

19

the presentation of the case here, and there is nothing

20

which currently bars Virginia from changing the statute or

21

changing the bulletin to its former way.

22
23
24
25

The election bulletin was only a regulation by
the ©lection officials.
There is one small mistake of fact that I would
like to call the Court's attention to, and that is that in
38

!

one of the cases cited by Mr.. McXlwaine, in which the

2

District Court required, it was clear that the assistance

3

could be given by persons other than state election officials

4

The point with respect to the Memorandum by the

5

Solicitor General raising the Section 5 question seems to

6

ei®

7

lation had been submitted to the Attorney General and the

8

Attorney General had approved it, we would have this case.

9

Assuming that he had rejected the memorandum, you would

to be resolved in this fashion, that assuming the regu­

10

have a situation whereas everyone who reads, Section 24"»252

11

was suspended, and therefore you have precisely the same

12

questions that are presented

13

light of that fact situation, whether the right to a secret

14

ballot could be preserved by soma means and whether the

IS

moans actually adopted in tills case was a reasonable means

tie

to achieve that end,

17

:

on this record, and that is in

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN s

W© will now have the

announcement of the opinions,
(Whereupon, at 2g25 p.m., argument in the above:
