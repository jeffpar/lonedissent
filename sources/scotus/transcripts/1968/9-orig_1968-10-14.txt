ARGUMENT OF VICTOR A. SACHSE, ESQ.,

3

OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SACHSE;

10

May it please the court, in 196 , as

11

Your Honors know, in an earlier stage of this same case, Your

12

Honors held that the Submerged Lands Act of 1953 confirmed ar

13

i quit claim to Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama three miles

14

from their coastlines, while quit-claiming three leagues for

15

Texas and Florida.
In your decree, as in the Submerged Lands Act itself,

16
17

the coastline is defined as meaning the ordinary low water

13

along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with

19

the open sea and the line marking the seaward inland waters.

2

I

This Court retained jurisdiction.

Some modifications

21

were mad© in December of 1965 by the United States, but the

22

coaiitline, although it long ago was designated and defined by

23

an agency of the Federal Government directed by Congress to do

24

that very thing, although it was long an accepted and approved

General of the United States,

a motion to have the Court recognise it.

4

and instead asked for the recognition of a line according to

5

his interpretation of the Geneva Convention, the Convention

on the territorial seas and the contiguous dunes.

The line you referred to is the Coast Guard line,

We donst refer to it as the Coast Guard line

to do with it.

We refer to it as the inland water line, but I

You can use that as a catch phrase.

14

A

We refer to it as the inland water line because

15

the

Congress directed in 1895 the Secretary of the Treasury

16

to designate and define,by suitable cirrangements, lighthouses,

17

buoys or coast objects, the lines dividing the high seas from

18

rivers, harbors and inland waters.
Inland water is the basis of this issue, as we have

22

It is the basis of the statute.

It is the point of

I want to say that the phase of the argument which I

23

will attempt to cover relates to the inland water line.

24

In January of this year the Attorney

25

General, through

the Solicitor, claimed a different line based upon the Geneva

Convention,

but we concluded that we found that line wrong also and that

used, as we

Therefore, argument concerning

19

I call your attention to a statement from a brief

20

filed on behalf of the Government in

21

case in which it was said to the Court that Louisiana shores

22

—• and I draw a distinction between coast and shore here — the

level that wind variations — and Your Honors know that we have
hurricanes of unbelievably severe power — can cause very

The shore line is not a stable one and that is quite

true and quite an understatement.

said the Government in 1956.

So

Although such a consideration ought not to be

11

necessary, and it is not,in our opinion, although the inland wai ;er

12

line is designated

14

and in our opinion ought to be understood by everyone to be

15

the outer limit of inland water as used by this Court and as

15

used by the Congress, a great part of the time allotted to

difficulty in discussing factual distinctions with respect to

19

any sort of a Geneva line.

and defined long, has been marked on

20

Q

For what purpose was that line established?

21

A

The 1895 line was established originally,

22

Justice Harlan, as we have tried to outline in our brief,

23

because the Congress made a deliberate decision in 1885 that

24

it xtfould prescribe different rules for the inland waters of

25

the United States than for the territorial sea.

1

It became necessary then to find out where this is,

2

where this was then„

7

This coiirt, in

Your Honors9 predecessors said then that the 1885 Act
had not drawn any line and, to quote from the Court, "nor could

50

any general legislation do so."

11

Congress, by the Act of 1895, passed since the occurrence

52

which caused the case to be before the Court had arisen, had

13

directed the Secretary of the

14

15

But the Court added, "The

Treasury to designate and

This Court decided that the inland rules declared

16

by Congress applied in the inland waters designated and defined

17

by the Secretary of the Treasury as fully as if New York

18

19

Harbor itself were involved.
Q

Perhaps that is the issue, that is to say, as I

20

understand the fact, that line was drawn for purposes of

21

determining which navagation rules would apply.

22

A

That is not to be disputed, but from that or

23

with that flows, in our opinion, the rights of territory and th€

24

rights of sovereignty because without the right of sovereignty

25

the United States would not have the right to legally declare
that inland rules of navigation apply to foreign vessels within

8

to the Congress by a spokesman for Louisiana,much as we are

presenting it to Your Honors here today,in 1949, when earlier

15

right word to use and the reason "coast" should be used was

16

because not only was that a part of our aggregate admission,

17

not only was it a part of our Constitution, but mere closely

18

to 'the point, Congress itself had used the word "coast” in the

19

1895 Act in undertaking to say where the inland waters are»

Our spokesman then, as I now, called that Act to the

21

attention of Congress, called the Delaware to the attention

22

of Congress, and from that time on, the legislature pending

used the word "coast line" and not shores»

25

of the United States to have the Congress accept the idea of

3

and the idea of the coast line was used.

There was an attempt by the then Attorney General

Now, I pass to another phase»

But this was rejected

Immediately following

S

the Act of 1895, the Secretary of the Treasury began to mark

7

this line to designate and define the line between inland

8

waters and the high seas.

9

coast objects, which means to us coast line.

As directed by Congres£3, he used
As directed by

10

Congress, he used vessels and buoys, which means to us that

11

Congress knew then, as it had known in all of its earlier acts,

12

that at least a part of the United States had its coast line

13

in the water.

14

So, it has been ever since.

The Government says in its;

15

current briefs that not until 1937 was there any Indication

16

by the Government that this line meant something different, that,

17

it did not actually divide inland waters from the high seas,

10

that after that time it began to put a different legend on

19

their charts or in their publications.

20

Mr. Schailowits;, for the Department of Commerce, said

21

the change occurred in 1948.

Whichever date you take, the

22

fact is that by that time we were in litigation and by that

23

time the Government had changed its position of not changing

24

any waters or any lands beneath submerged waters out from the

25

shores of the States and by that time you were heading towards

7

-

-

1
2

your first California decision.
We submit that changes made by the Government in

3

its treatment of its own publications after the case was in

4

litigation ought not to bear much weight with the Court.

5

We point to the fact that in the Government's brief

6

they refer to the fact that the Coast Guard Commandant who,

7

by that time, was the officer who then had the cuty formerly

8

possessed by the Secretary of the Treasury, by the Secretary

9

of Commerce and Labor, by the Secretary of Commerce, now the

10

Commandant of the Coast Guard has it and when he finished

11

marking on the charts, not designating and defining the

12

lights and the vessels and the coast markings, but actually

13

physically putting a line on the chart, he did make a statement

14

in which he said he was doing this for navigation and not

15

undertaking to set the boundaries of the United States or
■

16

17

■ •

of the States or of the jurisdiction of either.
We don't find fault with that statement because at

18

that time it had not been determined whether there were to be

19

three leagues for the States or three miles for the State or

20

some for one and some for another.

For the purposes of the Submerged Lands Acta

1' will net stand before the Court and say there are not
mobile boundrias on the sea, that as land filters out by
the Mississippi, as land recedes in other portions of our
shore, that adjustments will not have to be made sometime,
but as far as the Submerged Lands Act is concerned, the
Congress said one act divided into two -- Submerged Lands
Act and Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and in pursuance
of the Truman Doctrine of 1345, nobody but the United States
is going to have any of the minerals or mineral resources
from these submerged lands on our Continental Shelf.
Now, we will divide that between the Federal
Government and the state Government and they did it in
th© fashion, Your Honors know, of either saying three miles
or thro© leagues, as can he shown»
X must take a minute or two on the California case»
X cannot ignore the fact that in the secsond California case,
when the lawyers stood before this Court, and you did not have

the benefit, Justice Harlan, of any such line as this,

z

and Justice Brennan and Justice Goldberg asked Mr» Cox

3

whether California or the United States had any argument

4

to be based upon the inland water line.

5

and California did not dispute it»

6

Hr» Cox said no,

So far as we can find from the briefs, and so

7

far as we can find from the report of the decision by this

8

Court,

9

was no mention at all of it, and yet that is the case that

10

there was no mention of the Delaware case»

we think is most important of all»
A'

Your Honors said, through you, Justice Harlan, that
12

3
14

5
16

when the Submerged Lands Act was passed, there was no
definition of inland waters, because the managers expected
that earlier decisions and earlier acts of Congress would
supply that definition, and it was only because of the lack
of such a definition that you turned to the Geneva Convention»
I will close with thiss

If it be said in

'38

argument, as it has been said in briefs, that all states

19

must b@ treated alike, Your Honors know that is not

20

correct»

2

Your Honors have had the three leagues and

22

three mile issue before you before, but to bring it home

23

precisely to this point, when this legislation was pending

24

before Congress, there was a report by the Congress which

25

we have cited, Murabar 25 5, which deals precisely with the
-

-

1

thing X am now talking ©bout

2

Said the Congress — not soma Representative ,

3

not just a Senator, no matter how important, but the Congress;

4

There is a startling difference between the shore and

5

coaSt of Louisiana and Florida on the one hand, and

6

that of Texas and California ©n the other.

7

these contrasting coastal areas should be treated exactly

8

alike with ref@re.no® to the definition of inland waters

9

would ignore geographical factors that are wholly different.3

10

To say that

tie respectfully point out that however these

11

resources are used, whether 'they come through Louisian®

12

and the other liberal states, or whether they corns through

13

the Federal Government, only Americans can have them.

14

it would be a -tragedy, we think, to lead any foreign

15

nation to believe that these shallow waters, where

13

ocean-going vessels cannot travel, that these wafers between

17

the passos of the Mississippi River are international

18

waters or the high®as.
