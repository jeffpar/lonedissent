ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. YOUNG, ESQ.

S

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

MR. YOUNG:

Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court,

may it please the Court:
At the outset, I would like to introduce Mr. Stan

12

Sykes, an attorney admitted to the bar of Alabama, who is

13

associated with me in this case.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Very well, Mr. Sykes.

MR, YQUNG; First of all, appellants would like to
express their appreciation to the Court for the dispatch and
vigilance with which they have scheduled this case, a case that
may very well need additional remedial relief to protect the
most basic of all our rights in society, the right to vote.
We recognize that this has been an inconvenience to
the Court, but we are grateful that you have scheduled the
case so expeditiously.
We place this case before the Court in an urgent
fashion because we believe that the integrity of the 1968
presidential election is at stake.
-

3-

We believe that the transcript evidence before the

i
2

Court amply demonstrates that plaintiffs’ candidate, Governor

3

Wallace, has sufficient voter support in Ohio that his chances

4

of carrying that state are very substantial.
The transcript evidence shows polls that were taken, \

5
6

and they were placed before the lower court, and each of the

7

answers to those polls was prefaced on the condition,

8

Governor Wallace's name appears on the ballot, they would vote

9

for him.

10

if

On the other hand, it would appear to us from the

11

evidence of the transcript that if the plaintiffs in this

12

case are relegated to the Federal Court relief of write-in

13

status, if Governor Wallace's name is taken off the ballot in

14

Ohio, that his supporters in that state might as well forget

15

about those 26 electoral votes.

18
17

19
20
21

25

Thus we appear before the Court today seeking relief
that not only is essential to the protection of the equal
protection of the law and rights of the voters of Ohio, of the
candidates, of the minority political parties, but also pro­
tection of the integrity of this presidential election , and
an order which will convince at least 452,000 voters in Ohio
that they cannot be fenced out of the democratic electoral
process simply because their views do not agree with the views
of the majority party.

Q

Has there been any challenge at any stage of

1

those 452,000 signatures?

2

A

There have not.

We tendered them to the

3

election officials.

$

time they were placed before the District Court, the lower

5

District Court, they were placed before them, as the transcript

6

indicates, by a certified public accountant.

They did not care to review them.

the tilings he could not verify.

voters.

The petitions that were before

Therefore, the only verification that would be neces­

sary would be the age and the residence in the State of Ohio.
The duplications were culled out.
Q

The write-in, I gather, was only of the candidate's

A

That is correct.

16

Q

How did this affect, or accomplish, a vote for the

18

I

electors?
A

Onder Ohio law, we have an Ohio statute, and we have
fx'

19

had for many years, that states that a vote for a presidential

20

candidate whose name appears on the ballot is considered as a

21

vote for the electors pledged to him certified to the Secretary

22

of State.
The order of the lower court provided that in order

23
24
25

j

name, is it?

15

17

\

for a write-in vote for a presidential candidate —
Q

And they have been certified?
5~

!
2
3

A

No, we have in this case until October 15th to

accomplish that certification,
Q

In your scheme of things, I take it the write-in

4

doesn't satisfy any right by itself, but I take it you ask

5

for it separately?

S

A

We did not,

7

Q

What is your position, that the state could constitu­

8
9
10

tionally dispense with the write-in?
A

No, I do think that, the write-in does protect certain

fundamental constitutional rights,

11

Q

But not. by itself?

12

A

Not in and of itself, no.

13
14

Perhaps I might get ahead

of myself and explain why,
I think that a very significant aspect of the

15

inadequacy of the relief order by the lower court in this case

16

is demonstrated when one reviews the election laws in Ohio and

17

their relationship to the methods of write-in voting.

18

In Ohio, we have in excess of 13,000 precincts with

19

polling places.

20

counties in the state.

21

then, and that board of elections selects the voting method

22

that he feels would best suit his county's conditions.

23

The elections as such are governed by 88
Each clerk of the board of elections,

Now, the problem is that there are five different

24

voting nethods scattered throughout the State of Ohio in these

25

88 counties, and 13,000 precincts,
-

6-

I will review them real

!

quickly„

2

First of all, the basic paper ballot, and of course

3

the difficulties of a state-wide write-in campaign aren't too

4

great with that ballot, and it has an extra space, and rather

5

than checking the space with the name on it, one writes in the

6

name in the extra space and checks it»

7

Moving from there, we move to what we call the

8

sensitised paper ballot, used in Hamilton County, the third

9

largest county, with the City of Cincinnati.

10

They use the sensitised ballot.

It is a punch card

11

that has four holes on the corners of that sensitized ballot.

12

In order — the reason they have those is that these are

13

counted in the Secretary of State's office.

14

ported to the office, put on a machine, and they push a button

15

and they go through the machine and the sensitized votes are

10

recorded.

They are trans­

18

kind of device, he would be given a cigar-lighter type of

19

device with which he would stamp his choice, and' the stamp

20

makes a recording in this machine.
If he wanted to write in, he couldn’t use this

21

22

apparatus.

It writes too large.

23

able, and if he picked up the pencil first and started to write

24

in, there is no written instruction in the booths or on the

25

card to show that, the pencil would not record any of the votes
-

7

”

There would be pencils avail­

i

for all the other candidates.

2

So he couldn't use the cigar“lighter kind of

3

apparatus to write in,

4

other ones.

5

would know what to do would have to be to ask the voting

Q

officials, so this is going ~ and then, of course, they will

1

have to cull out all of these sensitized cards with any writing

8

on them and count them twice.

He couldn't use the pencil to mark the

The only way a voter in Ohio in this election

From those two methods, we move to the three-voting-

9
10

machine method.

The first one, the record demonstrates the

11

Shoup method which probably is the easier to use in write-in

12

situations.

13

listed vertically and to the left, and then the candidates to

14

the right.

It is the voting machine that has the offices

15

It is quite simple to use the write-in process in

16

those, because the little door that you lift up to find the

17

paper certificate just to the left of the office, and so you

10

go over there and write in.

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

£
j

.

But the more frequently used automatic voting machine
has its candidates almost horizontally across the top, and it
has a little box some place else where you have to lift up
doors to find the place to vote.
You have to correlate a number that is attributed to
a specific office, and go up some place else on the machine and
lift up the door that relates to that number and then write in
-8-

j

1

your vote»

2

For this particular year, there is a major problem»

3

The little slants where you write in slant this direction for

4

a right-hand voter, and a left-hand voter would almost have to

5

get up and stand on his head to write in that space»

6

Q

We are dealing here only with the offices of Vice-

7

President and President of the United States, essentially with

8

the election of the electors, not with senatorial or congres­

9

sional elections»

10

A

11

Wot in this case»
The final voting apparatus that I would discuss is

12

the coil voting machine»

13

because it has — it is really a tabulating machine, as the

14

record shows»

15

counted by an IBM machine, and he puts the IBM card into this

16

marking apparatus, a glass plate fits over it, and,it magnifies

17

the mark, on this ballot, and you go in and turn the card

18

around and when you get to the office you want to vote for, you

19

punch it, and it makes a mark on the ballot»

This will present problems, also,

'A voter picks up an IBM card,

and this is later

In order to write in, you have to get the card out of

20
21

the machine.

This would be simple to a lot of people, but I

22

think a lot of people would not realise

23

write with that card instead of the magnified apparatus.

.how they are going to

24

Q

Where is that used, in Butler County?

25

A

Yes, and I think down south, in one of the other
-

9-

!
Z

counties of Ohio.
I think that an explanation of these five different

j

3

kinds of voting devices suggests the utter frustration of try- J

4

ing to mount a state-wide voter education campaign, ox how are \

c

you going to go in and exercise the write-in right to vote,

j
I
i

6

It would be extremely difficult for some people even S

7

to accomplish it, and many voters, with many of the apparatuses!

8

would have to discuss this with the voting officials, and

0

reveal in essence who they are seeking to vote for when they

■

10

are trying to determine how to use this write-in device on

11

these machines.

12

f,

The record before the Court indicates that Governor

j
I

13

Wallace supporters have obtained ballot positions for him in

14

all 49 states.

15

of course if we include the temporary order, this would be 50

16

states, but for this litigation, and this is why it was

17

brought5 this year in the presidential election Ohio would have;

18

been shamefully alone as the only state in the country denying

19

ballot positions to a presidential candidate who could demon­

20

strate sufficient voter support to satisfy any reasonable

21

voting qualification, or candidate qualification requirement

22

established by any state.

23

He has been certified in 49 states now, and

j

We have demonstrated to the Court, we hope, that Ohio s

24

election laws are more harsh and more discriminatory as they

25

relate to the independent and third-party candidate voters than
-

10-

1

any other state in the country»

2

Mr. Sykes was doing some computations for me.

When

3

we looked through the voting laws in all 47 states where some

4

form of a signature petition was used — there were three

5

states;

6

and another state that it was an existing party that certified.

one of them, a convention was used; Alabama a primary,

7

But .in 47 states where signature petitions were

S

used, the total requirements, and this included Ohio, was

9

1,052,867.

]

Wien you subtract Ohio9s requirement from this,

10

433,100, it takes 619,000 signatures, using our methods, to get I

11

on the ballot in 46 states, and 433,100 —* pretty close to that :

12

figure — just to get on the ballot in the State of Ohio, and

13

J
after you get the signatures before the Secretary of State, you:

14

can't get on the ballot, and we hope to illustrate that later

15

on.

|'

■■

|

'

Just the 15 per cent requirement is 75 percent higher

18
17

than the percentage requirement in Mew York, 30 times higher

IS

than the ballot position requirements in each of the average of

19

the five states bordering on the

j

State of Ohio.

,

20

Q

Don't you have to win this point to win your case?

21

A

Which point is that?

22

Q

The unconstitutionality of this 15 percent.

23

A

It would be helpful, but it seems to me that even if

24

the 15 percent requirement were held to be constitutional, there

25

are several other aspects of Ohio9s voting laws which would
-

11-

1

demonstrate their violation of the protection of the equal

2

protection clause.

3

Q

Let's assume those others were bad.

4

A

Assume they were not?

5

Q

Assume they were bad, the other aspects of it.

8
7

a

That

would still leave the 15 percent.
A

Unfortunately!, once you get the 15 percent, you are

nowhere in the State of Ohio.

9

Q

1 know, but you didn't get the IS percent in time.

10

A

It depends what you mean by "on time."

11

Q

You seem to say as I read your brief that 15 percent

12
13

would have to be in before the primary.
A

There is no statute in the State of Ohio that requires

14

the 15 percent to be in at any time other than 90 days before ar

15

election,

16
17
18

Q

That is right.

Did I read you incorrectly?

I

thought you agreed that that was a proper interpretation.
A

Yes, but perhaps 1 should explain why.

The argument
t'

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

is, properly so, that in order to get on the ballot as a
presidential candidate, you would have to have delegates to a
national convention for the primary —
0

I understand that, but let's assume that all the

other provisions about a third party were unconstitutional, and
Ohio came back and said, "Well, we concede these other provis­
ions are unconstitutional, but the 15 percent requirement before
-

12

”

1

the primary is wholly legal, and this party didn't satisfy

2

thatf and so no relief»”

3

A

1 wouldn't agree, because I think here the liters

4

detail — the first attempt was an independent nominating

5

petition»

6

from the voters of the State of Ohio in 1948»

7

itself, would allow relief in this case»

a
3

Q

The mere fact that that was denied was taken away
That, in and of

Then you have to get to that, though, don’t you?

If the Court said that state was entitled to force candidates

10

to go through a party process, then you would have to win on

22
23
24
25

A

Yes, if they said that we must go through a political

party process, then we would have to show that the 15 percent
is unconstitutional,

I am satisfied that we could show that toj

this Court.
Q

{

Your arithmetic, in the arithmetic of it, you have

your 15 percent, haven't you?

It is just the question of

timeliness?
A

That is correct.

We do not suggest to the Court,

however, that because we could get the 15 percent that it is
not an overwhelmingly prohibitive requirement.

It must have

some relationship to a permissible state policy,
Q

I understand yoia have got it arithmetically, and the

validity of the signatures is not challenged, I suppose.

far as arithmetic is concerned, it is not very important to

3

that the timing is not the significant factor»

when , if we had filed those petitions five years before this

20

out those other laws, there would foe no requirement that it be

25

would be prohibitive against, this party.

It is only by inference from the primary

One could read the laws, I suggest, the average

lawyer, for 50 hours, and he would never realise that that

petition had to be in 90 days before the primary, because,

11

unless you understand every single election statute, you don't

12

get to that result.

S3

Q

But you do concede, Mr. Young, do you not, that

because of the interrelationship and interoperation of the

15

various Ohio election statutes, the word "elections" does mean

like that, are you?

20

say we were not attempting to qualify a presidential candidate

21

23

could mean primary, it could mean special, depending on what

24

use you were trying to make of the 15 percent requirement.

25

Q

Then that word "election"

It could mean general election, it

In this case, under the requirements of the Ohio
“

15

™

!

statutesc you are not questioning that they do require signa­

Z

tures to be filed 90 days before the primary election, and that

3

is one of the things you are objecting to?

4

A

We concede in this case, in order to get on the

5

ballot, if there weren't all these other unconstitutional pro­

6

visions, we would have to file before February 7th,,

7

tion about that.

8

e

Wo ques­

The State of Ohio in this case,in its brief that is
before the Court at the present time,has conceded the motivation,

io

the reason for the adoption of the key statute that we are

ii

concerned with in this case.

12

As to the legislation, amendments that occurred back

13

in 1948 to 1952, which completely eliminated the right of

14

nomination of independent candidates, they have stated that an

j

IS

independent candidacy is an evil, and they, because people end

\

18
17

up voting for someone they really shouldn't vote for, and these1
*
statutes in 1948 to 1952 were designed to stamp out that evil,

18

to wit, independent candidacies.

19

As to the independent party laws, the State of Ohio

20

states that it is a legitimate purpose to prevent third-party

21

candidates or third parties from interfering with the chances

22

of the two major party candidates to get a clearcut victory in

23

an election.

24
25

We concede those motivations also, and we do not
believe they withstand the requirements of the Fourteenth
-

16

-

1

2

amendment»

We do not believe that these are legitimate or

permissible state policies»

3

Q

Mr» Young, we are dealing here, of course, with a

4

constitutional issue, and I would suppose you would agree that

5

one wouldn't begin with the Fourteenth Amendment in this case,

0

but rather one would begin at least with Section 1 or Article

7

II of the Constitution»

8

A

Yes,

0

Q

And with the TwelfthAmendment?

10

A

Yes,

Q

What does —

12

When I read that section of the United States

16

That is correct, "shall appoint" its presidential

"Each state shall appoint»"

electors»

18

to about the 1870's, that no state has appointed its presides!"

19

tial electors by the legislative body doing so, but rather,

20

they have appointed their presidential electors by either — by

21

one form or another of letting the electorate vote for them»

Our constitutional history tells us that subsequent

So when I read that section, I do note that the state

23

could appoint, but when I read it in conjunction with what this

24

comply with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment of the

3

Constitution of the United States,

4

Q

The constitutional provision that you and I are now

5

talking about goes on and says, "Each stata shall appoint in

6

such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of

7

electorso ”

3

You would concede, I suppose, that a state today
could constitutionally provide by legislature that its electors

9

be named by the state legislature, would you?

10

A

11

Probably so, but as 1 read this Court's decisions, 1

am not a hundred percent sure.

12

Q

13

We deal here with a written Constitution, and in this

14

respect the Constitution is very explicit.

It says, "Each state

15

shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof shall

IS

direct a number of electors.”
We certainly must begin with that — shouldn't we? —

17

on the deliberation of the issues before us in this case.

18

h

19

That is correcto

I did not include it in my reply

20

brief, but on the day I had to file it, I called opposing

21

counsel and noted that I should have cited one case which I feel

22

comes closest to that.

23

That is the case of Kataenbach v, Morgan.

24

will well recall this was a New York case where the State of

25

New York was attempting to uphold its literacy requirement as a

r

-

18-

The Court

1

qualification for voting and as against the Federal legisla­

2

tion, the Voting Rights Act, which stated that if one attended

3

Puerto Rican schools and went to the sixth grade and wasn't

4

taught English, they could not be barred from voting,

5

One argument presented in this case was the fact

6

that the State of New York by reason of direct constitutional

7

grant, United States constitutional grant, had the power to

3

establish qualifications of voters in an election for United

©

States — members of the United States House of Representatives

10

u

and United States Senators.
In other words, in this instance, the state, like a

12

state would be doing if it were appointing electors, was doing

13

exactly what the United States Constitution told it to do.

14

And I have this real brief little quote here which

15

I think comes close to answering this requirement.

It starts

18

out by recognising under the distribution of powers affected by

17

the Constitution, the states established

18

voting for state offices, and qualifications established by the

m

states for voting for members of the most numerous branch of

20

the state legislature also determine who may vote for United

21

States Representatives and Senators, and then cites some

22

authorities.

■

qualifications for

23

But, of course, the states have no power1 to grant or

24

withhold the franchise on conditions that are forbidden by the

25

Fourteenth Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,
-

19

-

1

Such exercises of state power are no more immune to

2

the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment than any other

3

state action„

4

Now? as I read that, this Court is saying that,

5

regardless of the source, of whether the state is regulating

6

the qualifications simply by reason of the reserve powers in

7

the state constitution, or because of some constitutional grant

8

of authority like they were doing in the Katgenbach case, that

9

still the restraints of the Fourteenth Amendment still apply.

f

10

G

In the KataenbacR case, first of all, we were dealing|
•• : ■

1?

I think, with an act of Congress, which we don't have here and,t

12

secondly, we are not dealing, I don't think, with this explicit!
;

13

provision of the Constitution, not giving permission to the

14

states, but setting forth specifically how the electors shall

15

be chosen by the states, and they shall be chosen, they shall

16

be appointed as the state legislatures may direct»
Those are two very obvious and evident, at first

17
•18

blush, differences between this and the Kataenbach case, 1 think,

19

or am I mistaken?

20

A

Those are differences»

I don't see the distinction

2?

the same as you do, Justice Stewart, but certainly they are

22

differences»
It seems to me the section you are referring to does

23

not go on and say, however, that the state shall appoint in such
24

manner as it shall direct without regard to the protection of
25
■»

20«

1

2

such and such and such and such,
Q

Of course» the protection of such and such and such

3

and such didn't exist when this was written, because they

4

didn't come along until the 1860's, after the Civil War,

5

Certainly before the post-Civil War alterations in

6

the United States Constitution, it would have been clear, would

7

it not, under the second clause, Section 1, Article II of the

8

Constitution, yoxi wouldn't have had any case at all, any case

9

at all, would you, before the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and

10

f

Fifteenth Amendments?

ii

A

I don't think we would have»

12

0

So the question is here, really, is it not, how much, ]

13

if at all, the post-Civil War amendments have modified the

14

explicit provisions of the second clause of Section 1 of

15

Article II?

16

A

!

I am not sure that we would have to say modification,

17

because I don’t read that original provision as saying "in

18

such manner as they shall direct, discriminatory or otherwise»"

19

Wo case of this Court has ever held, to my knowledge, that

20

simply because of that provision that once the state went for­

21

ward with their appointment and appointed by way of delegation

22

to the electorate, they could do it in a discriminatory fashionj

.

In McPherson v„ Blacker, it seems to me even in that

23
24
25

case, and I guess it was after the Fourteenth Amendment-—
Q

1892»
21-

1
2

A

went on and indicated there was no discrimination

alleged in that case.

3

Q

Do you really want to rest on the argument that you

4

just elaborated, based on Katsenbach v, Morgan?

5

argument was that if the state chooses in effect to delegate

6

this power to the electorate, it must then do it on the basis

7

which preserves equal protection rights to all voters.

8
9

I thought your

That is to say, once you have taken the step that a
state chooses to vest this constitutional authority, which I

10

agree, as my brother, Stewart, does, that once the state

11

chooses to vest that in the voters, it has to provide that the

12

right should be available to be exercised by the voters on the

13

basis of equality,
A

14

That is precisely our position.

If I by any othes:

IS

answer suggested it was otherwise, I hope you will disregard

16

it.

That is precisely our position in this case.

17

Q

We were kind of off in left field, weren't we?

18

Q

Right field,
(Laughter.)

19

20

Q

Now that you have clarified what your position is,

21

does the legislature say to the voters, "We are going to share

22

this power with you, but you are not going to get it all? we

23

are going to choose and let you choose — choose between the

24

candidate of the Republican Party and the candidate of the

25

Democratic Party"?
-

22

»

?

A

Once we concede that after the state begins delega­

2

ting to the voters, that the Fourteenth Amendment protections

3

apply, then it seems to me that kind of delegation clearly must

4

fall, because there would not be a legitimate and permissible

5

state policy to limit presidential candidates, or presidential

6

electors, only to those who adhere to the beliefs of the

7

Republican or Democratic Parties, so it would be our belief

8

that this should fall.

9

Q

Although the legislature could say, it could pass

10

along, that the electors shall be chosen by the legislature of

11

the state, but they shall be chosen as between the electors

32

for the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, and each

13

year, each presidential year, the legislature will choose be­

14

tween the candidates of the two parties?

15

A

I feel that would be a blatant violation of the

16

Fourteenth Amendment, just as much as if they said, "You must

17

choose between members of the Jewish and Catholic religious

18

faith."
I don't think there is any justifiable permissible

19

20

basis for establishing such a position, and 1 think that such

21

a delegation should fall.

22

Q

Would there be any restriction at all, Mr. Young?

23

A

Any restriction?

We do concede, yes, we think that

24

the state, as indicated by this Court in many cases, the

25

Carrington case and others, that the state has performed the
“

23

-

1

historic function of protecting the ballot and protecting the

£

integrity of its elections, and making sure that the citizen's

3

right to vote was meaningful and they had proper methods for

4

voting, accuracy and all the rest»

5

We do feel that a state may place restrictions on all

8

of these items, but that in order to prevail, in order to

7

withstand constitutional challenge, that these must be reason­

8

ably or rationally related to a permissible state purpose.

9

I think that in the case at bar, in the case at bar

10

counsel and the State of Ohio have said what their purpose in

11

one of the statutes is.

12

dent candidacy.

Their purpose is to stamp out indepen­

The statutes they adopted were rationally related to

13
14

that first purpose, but it seems to me the second half of the

15

proposition fails, that this purpose is not a permissible state

16

purpose, so that would not, these are not —

'17

Q

Not permissible?

Well, whan you say not permissible,

18

it is not for us, of course, to judge the wisdom, or the

19

policy, or the good sense of the Ohio Legislature, but simply

20

whether or not its action is constitutional, and it is not

21

permissible under what provision of the Constitution?

22
23

A

The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States

Constitution.

24

Q

Which part of the Fourteenth Amendment?

That which demands equal protection of the laws.

Would you say that there is any distinction between

the unconstitutionality of the Ohio statute, and also assuming

the facts of life with which we are confronted?

Yes.

that we have no objection to the Socialist Labor Party appearinc

-

3

Q

I am trying to get at the theory, and it seems to me

this would be the quickest way to do it.
A

Once we start out with the proposition — recognising

4

because of the state9s historic function, and holding to its

3

procedures, that it can come up with some reasonable regulation

S

related to a legitimate policy — it seems to us if we accept

7

that proposition that the state could establish some reasonable

8

requirements preliminary to obtaining ballot position»

9

cally every state in the country does this.

10

Practi­

Now, if it is a. number requirement, it has to be the

11

size of the

12

make certain that the trap purpose and effect isn't just

13

discrimination rather than making certain that we don’t have —

14

we couldn't let eve.ry citizen have his name on the ballot.

IS

Q

the number has to be carefully scrutinized to

1 understand that, but we are faced with a practical

16

situation here, and I notice, 1 might say with surprise, that

17

in your paper you ask us to direct the Ohio Legislature to

18

formulate some sort of requirements that would be lawful and

19

constitutional.

*■

Do you really mean that, that the Court should

20
21

direct the Ohio Legislature to do that?

22

in your reply brief.

I believe that appears

23

Is that the way you would, as a practical man, make

24

a distinction between your case and the Socialist Labor Party

25

case?
-

27-

1

A

Perhaps the way you asked the question, I would

2

direct them that if there are to be requirements, that they are

3

reasonable requirements.

4
5

Q

That is not what I am asking you.

You can phrase it

any way yon want to.

S

A

Yes, I do phrase it that way.

7

Q

I am asking you how you go about making a distinction

8

between those.
L©tas assume that the Socialist Labor Party has 200

9
10

members all told.

Something like that has been suggested in

11

the papers, and you have got all these members, hundreds of
■

12

;
j

thousands of them.

As a matter of constitutional theory, and the functio^

13
14

of this Court, could you make a distinction and, if so, how, or

13

whafc is it that you are asking us merely to say to Ohio, that

16

its statute is unconstitutional because it is discriminatory

17

against so-called independent parties and independent candidates,

18

and therefore it must grant relief, and the relief order is not

19

the relief order to be ordered by this Court, which is a write-

20

in, but that, the names of both parties must be printed on the

21

ballot?

22

A

It seems to us that when one brings a case like this

23

before the Court, he must meet two objectives%

24

to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of the legislation that

25

is being challenged and, second, demonstrate by the principles
-

28-

First of all,

‘i

of equity that the court should grant equitable relief.

2

Now, if a party came before the three-judge District j

3

Court in Ohio and said, "We have one member, and we don't want

4

any more/’and another came in with 450,000 signatures on a

5

petition, it seems to us that the Court could make a distinctio:)

6

on this ground, as Judge Kinneary did in this case.

7

His distinction was that this party has demonstrated

8

that it has sufficient voter strength to meet any constitution-j

e

ally-permissible number.

He did not find that the other cases

io

demonstrated that it could meet constitutionally-permissifole

ii

standards.

12

party and the 350,000 — is the state law that kept this one-

13

man party off the ballot, or is it just the mere fact that they

14

aren't large enough to be on the ballot?

IS

Then a court of equity must decide on the one-man

Ife seems to me that once you concede reasonable

j

16

numbers regulations, then it seems to me that you get into the j

17

case where the plaintiff is coming intot court and asking

18

equitable relief, that a judge will look on their strength and \

19

see whether the laws themselves would keep the party off the

20

ballot.

J

21

Q

In effect, you think the Court should make a judgment

22

as to whether the number of signatures on your petition is

23

appropriate for equitable relief?

24
25

A

That is something that this Court would consider, I

assume, and whether the facts indicate that they have shown to

1

the court that equitable relief is appropriate,,

2

numbers is probably one of ths biggest factors in this case,

450,000 signatures.

Q

I think

You don't press your suggestion that we direct the

5

Ohio Legislature,that this Court direct the Ohio Legislature

6

to enact an appropriate and constitutional law?

1 have no misgivings about this Court directing the

8

Ohio General Assembly to adhere to the United States

Constitution inthis case any more than in the redistricting

cases, the malapportionment cases, or in the —

A
Q

If it is mine, then I champion it.
Mr. Young, can you suggest any occasion when this

Court has ever directed a legislature to adopt a particular
kind of law?
A

Well, in effect, it seams to me that the apportion­

ment cases, this court, or upon remand to the lower courts, the
courts have said that no election may go forward until you
reapportion your areas.
Some elections have been voided by Federal court
cases, and set aside, because there was not proper apportionment0
-

30-

1

Q

That is all that has been done, that is, set aside as

2

not properly apportioned, and you suggest if it is not done by

3

the state then the Court might set up that?

4

A

That is exactly what I am saying.

I am not playing

5

upon how this Court or any other Fedex*al court causes a parti­

6

cular state legislature to accomplish this.
It seems to me that if this Court were to say to the

7
S

Ohio General Assembly that, "Unless you revise your laws to

9

pennit reasonable participation by independent third-party
candidates, that there can be no elections under those laws."

10

This, in effect, is directing the State of Ohio to

11
12

revise its laws.

This is really what I am saying, and perhaps

13

I should have given that answer to Justice Fortas.

14

to me this is just as much direction as any other form of

15

direction, and v;ith the Ohio Legislative Service Commission,

16

these were laws that were adopted back in 1948,,

It seems

There is no question in my mind right now that on

proper order, the Ohio General Assembly would be delighted to

bring the laws up to date like the laws of other states,

back in January of 1968, without trying to get petitions, and

they were met with the argument, "Hey, you should have gone out

and tried to get petitions before you came into court."
Then on the other hand, we got the petitions and came

into court, and they said, "You should have filed your lawsuit

earlier."

Q

Do they Gave declaratory judgments in the Ohio state

courts?

A

We certainly do, but in this case-, in February of

1968, the plaintiffs were operating under the assumption that

if they proceeded forward and obtained 15 percent signaturas

11

tO'at they would get ballot position for their candidates.

It was a wrong assumption —

In his letter •— by the middle of July of this year, the

thousand signatures, and it appeared quite clear to them that

they would have no difficulty getting in excess of 433,000.

6

At that time, a request was made to the Secretary of

7

State of Ohio that if we meet this signature requirement, we

8

xvill be placed on the ballot.
One of the things he noted was that this new party

9
JO

could not call a state convention which would select electors,

11

and the reason he said that they couldn't call a state conven­

12

tion is because the Ohio statutes require existing off ce

13

based on this party's vote at the last election, and this is

IS

what the Ohio laws provide, so you see, he was saying that,

16

"You haven't had and you aren't going to have a convention,

17

and you don’t have people who can attend a convention, and

18

therefore you cannot certify electors to me."
This is one of the reasons provided by the Secretary

19

20

of State for refusing, and so he took the position that our

21

form of holding a convention would not satisfy Ohio law.

22

Q

I was wondering why you couldn't have gone into court

23

prior to the 29th of July to have these matters determined so

24

that the state would have ample time to either conform to its

25

election laws, or to change them.

A

First of all, it seams to me that we did not have in

2

this case a question of interpretation of state laws»

3

understand them, they do bar ballot positione

4

to me that plaintiffs have a decision of whether to seek relief

5

in the Federal or in the state court»

6

Once you

Then it seems

Quite frankly, I would have advised at any given

1

time to have filed a lawsuit such as this before a three-judge

8

Federal court, which has been a traditional forum in these

9

kinds of cases,and since we don't have an interpretation of

10

state law questions, but merely a constitutional validity of

11

state law, 1 personally sea no objection to the Federal court

12

forum.

13

Q

14

15

When do you conceive the first available date was open

to you for the suit you have here?
A

I am in somewhat of a difficult position, Justice

16

Warren, because we came into the case July 23rd, and filed it

17

six days later.

When could my predecessors have filed it?

18

Q

Yes, anybody.

19

A

Well, it seems to me that when they first became

20

convinced that regardless of whether they accomplished this

21

petition requirement or not, that they would not get on the

22

ballot.

23

sed, this party was organised in January of 1968. It recognised

24

the method of nominating petition had been denied in Ohio.

You couldn't get on the ballot by independent nominating

At that very point, if you wanted to challenge the

3

state’s insistence that you be a party rather than an independ­

4

ent candidate, you could have filed right then»

5

perfectly clear that you had to be a party and you couldn’t

6

petition yourself onto the ballot.

That was

That was clear, wasn’t it?

7

A

There is no question about it.

8

Q

There was also nothing vague about there being no

9

write-in.

io

A

There was no question about that.

11

Q

Also, there was no question but that what if you x-^ere

12

going to be a party, that you had to be a party and that there

13

was no question that you had to get 15 percent.

14

A

That is correct.

15

Q

You could have raised these questions very early.

18

A

I think when you look at the posture —■

17

Q

A

Without any confusion whatsoever.
I don’t think so.

I think that there would have been

19

as much confusion then as there would have been 'When we filed

20

a lav/suit, but any petitioning group trying to accomplish a

possible to get on the ballot without filing a lawsuit.

needed 15 percent? even though it is burdensome, we have enough

we have enough strength to meat the 15 parcent, and I assume

that that is why they proceeded, hoping they could get the 15

9

percent and get on the ballot and not have to file a lawsuit,

10

Q

They did know at that time, didn't they, that is, in

11

January when the organised the party, that they had no officers

12

that would have enabled them to comply with the state law?

They knew that, didn't they?

Yes.

Q

Do you think they have a right to proceed after that

4

without any effort to meet that portion of it, or to complain

5

about it for a matter of six months, until July 29th?

6

A

My only answer is that they felt they met substan­

7

tial compliance, they went full steam ahead, and even with

3

substantial compliance they wouldn't get on the ballot.

9

filed a lawsuit as timely as possible.

They

They filed a lawsuit

10

in sufficient time to allow a court to adjudicate this case,

11

the case has been able to come all of the way up to the Supreme

12

Court in time to grant relief.

13

grant temporary relief without disrupting the Ohio ballot, and

14

so — true the lawsuit is late, but is it so late that 400 and

15

some thousand voters in Ohio's right to sufferage should be

16

denied?

Justice Stewart was able to

Yes, that is precisely it.

Our having filed this

S

lawsuit late made it difficult for my friend, Sam Luchman, to

8

defend it, I am sure, but I don't vlhink that the rights of any ;

7

Ohio citizens have been prejudiced, because temporary relief

6

has been granted much later than that.

9

We feel that when you look at this case as a question

m

of the rights of 450,000 voters, the doctrine of laches would

11

not be applicable.

14

If I could, I would like to reserve just a couple of
minutes for rebuttal.

What point do you cite them on?

IS

use any argument to support an order of a trial court, even if

19

that order — even if the argument is inconsistent with the

20

basis for the order.

21

Ohio election laws require that a candidate for

22

President must be nominated by a national political convention

23

to which delegates have been selected in an Ohio primary.

24
25

In Ohio, in order to qualify as a new political party,
the group seeking to qualify must present signatures of 15
-

42-

1

parcent of the total vote of those voting in the last guberna­

2

torial election.

3

These requirements reasonably protect a valid state

4

interest.

5

there is a substantial number of disaffected people, disaffected

6

with the candidates or the programs of the two major parties.

7

This group is obviously issue oriented, and by signing an

8

independent nominating petition, they are at most expressing

9

some adherence to a principle.

10

As we point out in our brief, at any given time

In the interests of preventing any would-be candidate

11

or leader front coming in and grabbing this group without a

12

contest, the Ohio law requires that the candidate submit himself

13

to a primary election.

14

This gives the disaffected,this more or less cohesive

15

group, the right to choose its candidate, just as the primary

IS

laws give the members of the Republican and Democratic Parties

17

the right to choose their leaders.

18

The 15 percent requirement dovetails with this pri­

19

mary requirement by preventing a would-be leader from coming

20

in, circulating qualifying petitions, obtain only a few numbers,

21

and thus limiting those who would vote in primaries to sign.

22

Of course, he would select the people who would be

23

25

expected to support his candidacy.

philosophy might be deferred by the initial filing from filing

A

The three-judge court found that probably as early

z

as 1964, and certainly before November, 1967, the appellants

3

had been fully briefed by the Secretary of State as to the

4

requirements for ballot position in Ohio,,

5

Consequently , the appellants had adequate time after

0

November; 1967,, to file a declaratory judgment action, question-■

7

ing the Ohio statutes, which they feel are invalid, and if that

0

had been done, and if these statutes had been determined to be

9

invalid, there would have been time for the Ohio General

10

Assembly to reconsider the laws and amend them to comply with

11

any order which would have held these laws invalid.
It would have preserved the requirement of a primary,

12

13

by one manner or another, or in the alternative, the Court

14

could have adopted a procedure for this one election, which

15

would have satisfied all the objections that they might have

found in the Ohio election procedure.

17

Q

Mr. Lopeman, as I understand youradversary's position,

18

and maybe I am wrong about this, it is that nobody can comply

with this Ohio statute.

with it, regardless of when the party starts.
Has anybody ever complied with it?

22

25

That is to say, no third party or

Has there ever

been a third party or an independent candidate for President on
the Ohio ballot since the adoption of this statute?
A

No, your Honor, there hasn't, but —

Q

Do you concede that as a practical matter it would

2

be impossible to comply, and do you say that nevertheless the

3

Ohio statute is defensible?

4

A

No, your Honor.

Is that your position?
The State of Ohio does not maintain

5

that it is impossible.

6

to comply with the requirements, but nevertheless, pursuant to

7

the authority of Article II, Section 1, clause 2, the State of

e

Ohio is given plenary power to establish —- to appoint presi­

9

dential electors in any raannter it may direct.

10

Q

We firmly believe that it is possible

Let me see if I clearly understand this, now.
Your position is that even if it were impossible to

??
12

comply, to get a third party or an independent candidate on the

13

ballot, it is Ohi.o9s position that Ohio is still constitution­

14

ally justified in imposing such prohibition, but that you also

15

argue that as a matter of fact it is possible to comply with

16

the requirements of the Ohio statute.
Is that right?

17
18

A

That is correct,your Honor.

19

Q

The lower court found to the contrary, did it not?

20

The lower court found that there could not be compliance with

21

the Ohio statute?

A

We have trouble with the order, the decision and the

23

order of the lower court, and I do not believe that order is

24

clear what findings they did in fact make.

I am not entirely clear on them myself, and you say

you don’t know whether there is a specific finding to that

Could they limit it to Democrats

The question of ■ the extent of the pov/er of Article II

AFTERNOON SESSION
12s30 p„m„
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Loperaan, you may

continue your argument.
MR. LOPEMAN%

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

When the argument broke for the lunch©or» recess,
I was considering the application of the equal protection
clause to the Article II powers vested in the State legisla­
tures. ' We agree

that the equal protection clause may very

well apply some limitation to the power of the State legislatures to direct the appointment, or the manner of the
appointment of presidential electors.
We believe that that power may be limited in such a
respect that the State legislatures could not disqualify
anyone from being an elector on the basis of race*

However,

no claim has been made that the Ohio procedures violate these
kinds of equal protection guarantees.
We do deny, however, that there is any limitation
on the legislatures" power based on -the principle that
electors should be chosen on the basis of popular support of
candidates„
The McPherson case recognised, and appellants con­
cede, that the legislature has the right to appoint electors.
When the legislature does appoint directly, it cannot appoint
on the basis of popular support for the simp!© reason it doesn

51

1

know the popular support* no election having been had.

2

The argument could be made* however* that once an

3

election is held* that some other kind of equal protection

4

limitation certainly appears.

5

Equal protection is not particularly applicable to

6

elections.

7

appoints directly or when it holds an election,

8

9

Q

It applies equally to the legislature when

On fell© question of equal protection* do you make

any distinction in these two cases that we are .'hearing argu­

10

ment on today?

I!

is* that one could prevail and the other could lose?

12

it

A

That is* in the result to be achieved* that

Hot on equal protection* Your Honor.

Both must

13

fail on equal protection* because equal protection is not

14

applicable.

15

However* in a situation where there is no right to

18

have a vote but a vote is nevertheless had* for example*

17

the situation in Georgia where this Court held that there is

18

no Constitutional right for the Governor of a State to be

10

elected by popular election* nevertheless* Gray would suggest

£0

that there is soma kind of limitation .based on equal pro­

21

tection that applies to this situation.

22

j

However* this other kind of equal protection is

23

not representative government* for* if it were* how can this

24

Court explain Portson* although the election was not required

25

to be held* when it was held* this Court allowed the legislature
$2

1

2
3

to disregard the result of that vote and select the candidate
receiving the least popular votes»
Q

Welly then,, you don51 concede that if Ohio provio.es

4

for an elective process,, to get on the ballot for the

5

presidency, that that must be in accordance with equal

6

protection?

that there may be some requirements,

Do you say the opposite, that they arenot required

to honor equal protection if they have an election?
A

They are required to honor some of the guarantees

12

contained in equal protection, that is race, religion, and

13

Suppose they said they could have an election with

another party, and they get 95 per cent of the people on the

It would be our position that Article,II, Section 1,

Some parts of the equa} protection clause apply.

That is the extent of your

argument, isn't it, on this point?

A

That is correct^ Your Honor,

15

Q

Mr. Lopeman, is there a distinction between the

16

right of a candidate to appear on the ballot, have his name

17

appear on the ballot,and the right of a political party?

18

Now,there is in the Ohio election law, as I read

19

it, elaborate requirements for a party to appear or to get

20

its name on the ballot, it has to have a primary, and so on.

21

It would seem to me perhaps arguable that there is a reason-

22

aife distinction between what a State may do with respect

23

to requiring a political party to qualify on the one hand

24

and allowing an individual candidato to qualify on the other

25

hand.

For example„ in one of the other cases before us,

the California case * I notice that, they have separate pro­

decision in this case provides that Ohio shall show oa its

10

11

and the name of Mr. Wallace and his vice presidential candi­

12

data.
The point that I am asking you about is whether

13
14

you would make any argument to the effect that the Ohio re­

15

quirements are certainly valid and, reasonable with respect

16

to a political party* even though we might conclude that

17

they are not reasonable and Constitutional with respect to

i8

the qualifications of an individual as a candidate or his

19

electors?

10

A

No* Your Honor* I do not believe there is a dis­

>t

tinction* based on the power of Article II and the plenary

12

power that the legislatures have* whether or not it is an

13

individual candidate or a party.

2

the light of your argument -- but if we should arrive at

3

the conclusion that the State's power has to be exercised

4

I know you don't make that assumption in

reasonably, is it possible to say that on analysis of the

3

Ohio law that the State is exercising its power reasonably

6

with respect to a political party but not reasonably with

7

respect to the candidate?

8
9

A

No., Your Honor, ws believe that the State of Ohio

is acting reasonably with respect to the candidate, too,

10

for the reason that the State has a legitimate interest in

1?

protecting against the distortion of the popular vote against

12

the two candidates having a chance to win„

13
14

Q

Is there any way that an individual can get on the

Ohio ballot except through the party route?

15

A

A presidential candidate, Your Honor?

16

Q

Yes,

17

A

No, there is no way that a

presidential candidate

18

or his electors can participate in a presidential election

19

in Ohio except through a party primary, and a party ballot„

20

Q

Mr» Lopaman, I have a mechanical sort of a question.

21

The interim relief that I granted, as I remember, required

22

the State of Ohio for the time being to put on the ballot

23

the names of the American Independent Party, and George

24

Wallace, and a man named Griffin.

25

Mow, I read the papers every now and then, and

58

Griffin wouldn't seem to be the right name, would it?

Let me say that if the Ohio ballots are required

to b© re-printed with a different name for vice president,

The ballots have been printed and put in a

Q

And the name on, there for vice presidential candidate

is Griffin, is it not?

18

A

That is correct.

19

Q

That just isn’t right, is it?

20

A

It is pursuant to Mr. Justice Stewart's order.

21

Q

But as a matter of feet, he isn't the vice presiden­

22

tial candidate, is he?

23

A

So far as we know.

24

Q

I guess he is for purposes of the Independent Party

25

in Ohio.

Those electors, if Mr* Wallace carried the State of

59

1

Ohio* the electors would have to go to the electoral college

z

and vote for Mr» Griffin?

3

A

Well, that’s another question, Your Honor»

We

4

feel that probably the presidential electors, once they ara

S

chosen, are not bound by names appearing on the ballot,

6

but we admit we don't know the answer to that question,

7

Q

You don't think the Ohio electors are bound?

8

A

We don't know toe answer.

9

10

This Court has not

decided it, and we don't know.
Q

What does Ohio law say, though, and doesn’t the

11

Ohio law purport to bind electors to vote for the candidate

12

of their party?

13
14
15

A

Only as of the time they are nominated by the

convention, which is another thing —
Q

Do you think under Ohio law an elector may be

18

free to vote in the electoral college, to vote for anyone

17

he wants to?

18

A

An elector may be, yes,

19

Q

Couldn’t he be punished?

20
21

You don't think that

it is binding?
A

That is correct, Your Honor, although it may be

22

a provision of state law,

I guess we feel that there is a

23

serious question about its enforceability.

24

Q

In what respect?

25

A

The possible conflict between the rights, duties,

60

t

and authorities of electors, under the Federal Constitution,

z

and t.a

3

Q

requirements of law binding them.
That was decided in Ray v. Blair, that was a case

4

in which Alabama did require by State law that the electors

5

rote for the national candidates of their party, and this

6

Court in an opinion by Mr. Justice Reed held that this did

7

neb violate either A:.tide II, Section 1, or the Twelfth

8

Amendment.
■V.

Is there a provision of Ohio law which purports

8
10

to require electors p'edged to a certain presidential candidate

11

to vole for him?
I have been advised by co-counsel that there is a

12
13

requirement.

It was ere with which I was not familiar.

We base much of our case on the authority of

14
15

Article II, but even if it didn't exist, appellants could

16

not prevail o:i this appeal.
Although one man-one vote is an applicable standard

17
18

for judging legislative apportionment cases, it does not

19

answer the questions raised by the interrelationship and the

20

interaction of third party candidates in presidential politics.
History shows us the third party candidates do not

21

22

win presidential elections in Ohio.

What is that

Again this is a problem that this Court faces.
Don't we, rather,

face the question

as to whether

citizen to vote for anyone else but one of those two parties?

10

The question isn't the right of the citizen to

vote, it is the right of the legislature to place qualifice\

Yes, Your Honor, they do, pursuant to Article II.

wanted to?

Yes, insofar as they could not have elections,

they can limit it.

Not for presidential electors, Your Honor.

The

Article II power would exclude the right to make this restric­

16
17

18

Q

So if fifty States decided only Democrats can vote,

Republicans would be out of business, wouldn't they?
A

Yes, that is true, but the answer to this kind of

13

I
unfairness in the legislature is electing a new legislature,

20

and when the legislature is elected by one man-one vote,

21

wa can be reasonably sure that this kind of thing will not

22

happen.

23

Finally, where do we get the idea that representative

24

government applies to presidential politics, when the whole

25

process is not representative?

65

The electors are selected

1

in the states as a unit.

The popular vote frequently differs

2

from the electoral vote,and certainly there is no mathematical

3

correlation, again one man-one vote does not apply,
There is a further distortion by the provision

All right*

To get to my next question, that is
s

to say, if this Court orders that the American Independent
Party appear on the ballot, and the names of Mr. Wallace
and Mr. Griffin appear on the ballot, what will be the effect
of this Court’s order in the ©vent that the people of Ohio
give that ticket a plurality of their votes?
A

Governor Wallace under those circumstances has

announced hi© position, and he has indicated that he would

2

A

3

You are asking me, I beg your pardon,

it seeras

to me, a political question.

4

Q

I am asking you what -the legal effect will be.

5

Will the legal effect be 'that the electors will have to

6

cast their vote for Mr. Griffin as vice president?

7

A

Wo.

8

Q

Or will they not?

9

A

We donEfc think that that would be the legal effect.

10

Q

You are saying that legally they will be free 'to

;

vote to cast their vote for someone else for vice presidden?

11
12

A

Yes, Your Honor.

13

Q

Now, is Mr, Griffin the candidate, in whatever

14

sense you want to put it, at the present time, of the American

15

Independent Party of Ohio?

16

A

Now, if you will allow me

Q

In any sense whatever?

A

If you will allow me to repeat what I have read in

19

the papers, I will be glad to tell you that.

member of this party.

21

that Governor Wallace will commend the electors to vote for

22

Curtis Lemay as Vice President of the United States.

How was Mr. Griffin originally selected before

25

The petitioners who signed this petition,

73
1

!

450-some thousand people gave to the three men who are

2

named in the petition the authority to call a State conven-

3

tion, or in the absence of a State convention, to make the

4

selection.
A State convention was scheduled, and when it was

5

8

indicated the results of that convention would not be recog-

7

nised, then it was exercised by the other three.

8

convention was called, and it was scheduled to be held,

9

and the Secretary of State has .indicated that he would not

But a State

10

respect the results of that convention, and I think this

1!

answers the other point as to whether all of these other

12

laws do apply to third parties.
Exhibit 13 in the transcript shows that the Secre­

13
14

tary of State said that is why he didn't let them on the

15

ballot, because of those requirements.
So my answer is that I do not feel the electors

16
17

in Ohio are pledged, and as for the vice presidential candi­

18

date, they could select Curtis Lemay rather than Marvin

19

Griffin in Ohio.

20

Q

Are they obliged to vote for Wallace?

21

A

No.

22

Q

They can vote for Mr. [5X” and Mr. Griffin if they

23
24
25

want to?
A

As a matter of law, I think they are free to vote

for whomever they please in Ohio.

understanding, that the State could, with equal convenience,

action of the District Court?

7

A

You made that perfectly clear to us, and the order

Independent candidate?

A

Yes, under the old law that existed.

Q

That is before 1948?

A

Yes, with on© per cent of the signatures someone

1

could get on the ballot*

2

Q

As a candidate?

3

A

That is correct, yes,and this was the method first

4

sought in Ohio by these people, and then they moved in the

5

political party direction,

6

Q

The laws enacted after 1948 simply limited independent

candidates, they didn't really affect -the laws applicable

8

to parties, did they?

9
10

A

Except to the indirect extent ~

Q

The fact was that you could not be independent,

and the only way you could be a candidate on the ballot was

through the party machinery,

A

Before 1948, all of the parties used the independent

nominating petition technique, because that provided that
even though you were technically an independent candidat©,
you would put in a label, and so all of the political parties
in Ohio used the independent nominating petition technique,
but they were allowed to put a label next to the name, so
that there was this flourishing of independent parties under
the prior system.
I see my time is up,

Just a final point,

1 hope

this case is not decided on the basis that it is possible
to get on -idle ballot in Ohio,
This group had 2,700,000 signatures over the
country and 450,000 signatures in Ohio, an adequate strength

77

1

to comply with any kind of a requirements and it isn’t a

2

question of time,

3

1 have cited it in my brief* but there is no way*

4

they are completely barred by these statutes.

5

ever decision is rendered is rendered on the recognition

6

that independent and third party candidates are barred*

7

and barred effectively, from participating in presidential

8

elections in Ohio.

I hope what­

I hops at least as far as the temporary relief

©

1©

by October 15 * w© can receive an order confirming the order

11

of Justice Stewart*and that the situation by order of this

12

Court* or upon remand*will be cleared up in Ohio* so they

13

will have free elections.

14

' G

Let me be sure I understand you.

IS

What would be the effect of a final order?

16

Why do you make the distinction between a temporary order and

17

final order?

18

k

19

20

Because there are two questions before the Court*

the matter of temporary relief and ultimate relief.
Mr * Lopeman 1 s statement suggested to' me that unless

21

you order his name off the ballot by October 15* they are

22

going to have a hard time taking it off.

23

me that you have a time pressure on the temporary question

24

before you* but not as much time pressure on the ultimate

25

relief question of how do w© handle all of the future elections
78

So it seems to

1
2

in Ohio.
Q

You mean to say that if we rule on the merits

3

here,in your opinion, we will be deciding something that will

4

have to be decided on the constitutionality of tha Ohio

5

statutes as applied in this case, or generally, and in

6

either event, wouldn't we?

7

A

Yes, sir.

8

Q

What you are saying is one will be an interim

9

order and one will be a final order, but we would not be,

10

in any case, adjudicating whether there is such a thing as

n

•the American Independent Party as a formal Ohio party under

v?,

Ohio laws for future purposes?

13

A

Is that right?

I don't think it is necessary for the Court to do

14

that, but tha name as it appears on the ballot with a label

15

would be much the same as the objective, the techniques used

16

in the State of Ohio.

17

Q

What would you think if today were the last day

18

the Court could decide this case aid still get the narae off

19

the ballot if it was decided against your position?

20

if this were the last day?

21

and you say the suggestion is the 15th?

22

23

difficult to decide in one day and write up?

I would probably go away pleased with the temporary

relief that we received.

ought to happen to the temporary relief in that case?

could be that we could not decide this case.
