MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

No. 65, Timothy F. Leary,

petitioner, versus The United States.
Hr. Martin, you may proceed with your argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. MARTIN, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MARTIN:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please the

Jourt, I would like this morning to turn and address myself to
petitioner^ contention that his conviction on the charge of trans
porting and concealing marijuana on which the tax hasn't been pai.
in violation of Section 4752 of Title XXVI is unconstitutional
because the conviction on that account violated his privilege
against self-incrimination.
To a certain extent the claim raised here is identical
to that presented in the case to follow, United States versus
Covington.

There is a significant difference, however, because

in this case we do have a factual record against which petition­
er's assertion of this claim can

judged.

I would like to turn to that record, if I might.

Prior

to trial petitioner's counsel moved for a continuance to allow
him to prepare;his defenses»

In the motion for continuance peti

tioner's counsel stated -- this appears at page 34 of the record
and I am quoting:

"Defenses will be raised which will show that

this defandant is an authority on psychedelic drugs which this
defendant maintains includes marijuana, and that he should have

1

the right of experimentation with such drug, including marijuana

2

and that although there are provisions in the law which would

3

seem to allow a person to experiment with marijuana, such provi­

4

sions are in actuality nonexistent because it is not possible to

5

obtain an order form and legally pay the tax on marijuana and

6

any uses without such order form is held to be illegal."
Similarly at the close of the case in arguing for a

7
8

judgment --

9

Q

Mr. Martin, that is not in the printed appendix?

10

A

It is not in the printed appendix.

It
12

It is in the record

before the Court.
At the close of the case petitioner moved for judgment

13

of acquital.

14

page 493 of the record:

15

tists working in a laboratory can obtain marijuana, but not

16

those who are using it for religious beliefs."

17

At that time his counsel stated, and this is at
"Under the tax count doctors or scien­

Again at the close after the verdict had come in and the

18

motion for new trial was filed, counsel argued that

19

the written motion for new trial submitted after the judgment,

20

it appears at page 649 of the record — 'The Court erred in deny­

21

ing the defendant's motion for a judgment of acquital on counts

22

2 and 3 of tho indictment for the reason that the evidence demon­

23

strated the defendant transported marijuana in pursuit of his

24

free exercise of religion, in pursuit of experimentation out of

25

the lab, and in pursuit of his right to bring up his family in
30

this is

i

1

accord with his honest belief."

z

Since the $100 an ounce tax is a prohibitive tax, con­

3

viction on count 3 as well as 2 violates the First and Fifth

4

Amendments of the Constitution of America.

5

position in this case that petitioner from the outset recognized

S

;hat his failure to comply with the Marijuana Tax Act was not

7

;he result of any fear that he would tend to incriminate himself:,

8

aut rather on his recognition that the act acted, as to him, as

9

i total bar on his right to possess marijuana.

10

It is the Government'

We submit that the petitioner incorrectly construed the

11

ict, that it is our contention that the Marijuana Tax Act, as

12

:onst.rued and applied, does not compel self-incrimination because

13

Lt prohibits those who could not legally deal in marijuana from

14

landling marijuana.

15

Q

Do we test a man's Fifth Amendment rights by what hap--

16

>ens at preliminaries in the proceeding or by what happens at the

17

:rial?

18

A

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, what we have to do is to

19

ixamine the validity of the claim.

20

igainst a factual basis of what he believed, as counsel mentioned

21

yesterday.

22

tot obtain marijuana under the act.

23

I think it has to be examinee

Petitioner testified at the trial he knew he could
So you have that also.

It is our position that the Tax Act in question was

24

lesigned by Congress to prohibit, and that is clearly stated in

25

iach of the reports accompanying the legislation, that the bill

31

1

was designed to prohibit those who could not legally handle mari­

2

juana from doing so.

3

tax.

Congress did this by imposing a prohibitive*

4

Q

5

up that way.

3

person who wanted the product for certain uses could get a permit

7

and pay a hundred dollar tax.

8

gress is just fooling and what this really is, is a statute that

9

prohibits the use of marijuana except for the dollar an ounce

10
11

Perhaps unfortunately Congress did not set the statute
They set it up as if it were serious and as if a

You are asking us to say that Con­

purposes.
A

I think, Mr. Justice, what we are asking the Court to

12

do is to look at the statute in terms of the realities.

13

if jou look at the record before Congress, which included testi­

14

mony from Mr. Hester, who has been referred to previously, and

13

others, that the time this tax was enacted, marijuana was selling

IS

in the illicit market at $1 an ounce.

17

ounce tax, clearly prohibitive.

18
19

Q

I think

Congress imposed a $100 an

Do you use this as a distinction between Marchetti and

Jrosso?

20

A

Yes, we do.

21

Q

In other words, you say because the tax here is such a

22

great amount on the $100 uses that we ought to look at it as if

23

Congress instead of going through the ritual of the taxing

24

machinery, prohibited the transfer, possession or transportation

25

of marijuana except for the dollar an ounce purposes?
32

1

A

That is correct.

2

Q

And that so construed, you say, that this is different

That is the way the act ---

3

from Marchetti and Grosser because in Marchetti and Grosso any­

4

body could apply and there was no distinction in the amount of

5

the tax?

6

A

That's right.

I think it 'is important to note also,

7

ir. Justice Fortas, that what you have here, what you didn't have:

8

in Grosso and Marchetti, is an industry in which marijuana had

3

illegitimate and illegal uses.

10

Congress is attempting to dis­

tinguish those.

11

Q

Doesn't that cut against your point?

12

A

No, it doesn't.

1.3

Q

Marchetti and Grosso, the entire industry so-called

14

«as an illegitimate one?

13

A

That is correct.

16

Q

So it would have been prohibitive.

What they wanted tc

17

io in Marchetti and Grosso was to prohibit everybody from using,

18

jossessing or transferring or whatever it was, that kind of fire-

19

irm.

Here they wanted to prohibit only some.

20

A

In Marchetti and Grossoparticularly ----

21

Q

I beg your pardon.

22

A

In Haynes there was a $200 tax.

I was talking about Haynes.
In Haynes we were deal

23

.ng with only one particular requirement of the act which clearly

24

required people to register if they had a firearm of the type

25

lescribed in that statute.

Here, however, I think it is important
33

I
3
1

to note that all the disclosure requirements are directed basi­

2

cally at the legal industry, the legal marijuana industry, so

■c*

that legal use of marijuana would be made public and that the

4

law enforcement officials could see that the legal marijuana was

5

not diverted into illegal channels.

{

6

Q

Is there any reason why Congress did not enact a pro­

1

hibitory statute other than tradition and bureaucratic claims on

3

this particular activity?

9

A

I think the only reason they didn't enact a totally

10

prohibitory statute insofar as the illegal transaction was con­

11

cerned -- there was a legal market, so they could not totally

12

prohibit it — insofar as the illegal market is concerned, the

13

reason they chose to use the prohibitive tax form was because at

'14

the time Congress was concerned with the five-four decision of

15

this case and the six-three decision in Nigro«Doremus.

IS

They were afraid unless the prohibitive section was

17

put in terms of a prohibitive tax, there might be some constitu­

18

tional problems with that.

19

20

Q

Also they were acting, they thought, under their power

to tax, under their taxing power?

21

A

That is correct.

22

Q

That is the power under which the earlier narcotics

23

legislation, Federal legislation, had been upheld.

24

not purporting to prohibit anything.

They were purporting simply

25

to be exercising their power to tax.

Isn't that right?

34

So they were

1

A

They did, Ilr. Justice, in the Harrison Act, which pro­

2

hibited all but legitimate forms of dealing in narcotics involved

3

there.

4

sion of this Court in those cases that the fact that there was

S

a general prohibition not formed in terms of the tax created some

6

problems.

7

Q

I think there was some concern because of the close deci

You are asking us to construe this, to look at this as

8

if it were something that Congress avoided.

You say Congress

9

avoided it because of constitutional doubts as well as because

10

Treasury’s claim as of that time for this highly prized jurisdic

11

tion, I suppose premised upon its exercise of its taxing power?

12

A

I think what we are -asking the Court to do is to look

13

at the reality of the situation, to look at the fact that since

14

this act was enacted providing this $100 tax on one ounce of

15

marijuana, that was selling in the illicit market for a dollar,

16

no person has ever applied to pay for this tax, that the effect

17

of it was to make it a prohibitive tax.

18

taught in Gross and Marchetti that the fact of the Fifth Amend­

19

ment has to be real.

20

Therefore, this Court

We submit here the Court has to look at the whole statu­

21

tory scheme in this frameitfork.

22

appears here the claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege is not

23

real and substantial, but is rather a fanciful and imaginary

24

claim which the petitioner came up with after the fact in an

25

attempt to excuse his clear violation of Federal law.
35

I think from that examination it

It is for that reason that we feel the contention of
the Fifth /Amendment privilege here should be rejected by this
Court.
Q

Hr. Martin, if this man had not taken the stand, would

your argument be the same concerning those excerpts from the
record you just read us?
A

I think it would be the same except that we would not

have his testimony.
of the act.

I think we do have a lawyer’s construction

Counsel yesterday said that the Government's con-

struction here was an imaginative one and suggested it was some­
thing novel.
Here is a lawyer look-ing at the act and construes it
in the same way we did before the issue was ever raised.
it is somewhat persuasive from that standpoint.

I thin!

I think, too,

it goes to the reality of the situation, the fact that this act,
everybody recognized, prohibits people, who could not handle
marijuana legally, from doing so, that the practical effect of
it is the total bar and for that reason the claim of Fifth Amend­
ment privilege is really a fanciful one, which we submit was
constructed after the fact and not the true motivating reason
that the petitioner did not attempt to comply with the act.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN;

Mr. Haft.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J

HAFT

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HAFT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.
36

1

I think that persons have not sought to apply for writ­

2

ten order forms or to pay the tax because the statute is so

3

blatantly self-incriminatory that it would only be a mad man who

4

would come to the Government and seek to fill out this order

5

form.
I read during the courseuof ray argument the testimony

S

7

of petitioner during the trial, at pages 86, 87 and 89, where

S

he specifically said that he feared incrimination.

9

the motion which the Government has read, I think that they have

10

left out the very point that was raised on page 651 of the tran­

11

script :

In part of

"The court erred in not dismissing or granting a judg-

12
13

ment of acquital as to the tax count because such tax requirement,

14

■violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.'
It was raised at the District Court level.

15

The peti­

16

tioner specifically testified as to his very real fear of incrimi-

17

nation in the portions I read yesterday.

18
19
20

Q

I beg your pardon.

How many cigarettes, or whatever

they are called, of marijuana would be made out of an ounce?
A

I don't know, Mr. Justice Fortas.

The figure that I

21

used yesterday was one pound yields 1700 cigarettes.

22

roughly a hundred cigarettes an ounce.

So that is

23

Q

That would mean the tax is just a cent on a cigarette?

24

A

Yes.

25

That is the legal tax.

the hundred dollars an ounce.

37

It would be a dollar on

,

1

I think what the Government is, in essence, asking here

2

is because Congress perhaps having doubts about the constitution­

3

ality of an outright prohibition and because they wrote an

4

express tax measure rather than a prohibitory measure, if this

5

Court feels that a prohibitory measure is constitutional, this

6

Court ought to go ahead and rewrite^ the legislation.

1

completely the wrong position.

.

8
9

That is

Going back to the presumption point of yesterday, in
answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question as to the other adequate-

!Q

evidence of guilt which there clearly was, I pointed out that

11

under the Court's decision in United States against Romano my

12

position would be sustained.

13

In addition, I would like to point out to the Court

14

that on pages 102 to 104 of the record in the charge to the jury,

15

the District Judge in practical effect limited the entire case

16

to the trip from New York to Texas on the admission of acquisi­

17

tion by the defendant plus the statutory presumption and left

18

little of the case on the return back.

19

I think the charge is very clear, points almost exclu­

20

sively to that one theory.

21

make application, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court

22

the next case, the Covington Case, raises just the tax issue.

23

In the last minute I would like to

We do feel, and the Government does not object if the

24

Court pleases, we do feel that the bulk of the argument on the

25

taxing statute will come duririg the Covington argument.

38

Counsel

1

for Covington is agreeable to permitting counsel for Leary to

2

have some part of his time in arguing the further parts of the

3

Marijuana Tax Act.

4
5

If it would please the Court, we would like to split
the argument to some extent on the Covington Case.
