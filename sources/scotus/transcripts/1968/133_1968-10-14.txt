ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN It GRISWOLD, ESQ.
THE SOLICITOR GENERAL
OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

8

MR. GRISWOLDs

9

Counsel are present.

j

Mr. Chief Justice, this case Is

here on re-argument, having been previously presented to the

10

Court last May on a motion made by the Government to modifj

11

an order of the Court which the Court entered in January oi

12

this year.
The case began as an indictment for conspiracy to

13
14

15
16

17

transmit in interstate commerce communications concerning
threats

designed to injure one Robert Sunshine of Denver,

Colorado.
There were originally four defendants.

One was

m

acquited and is not here.

19

to the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.

20

One of them, a man named Kolod has since died, and now the

2\

The other three defendants appealed

case involve the two Messrs. Alderman and Alderisio.

22

At the- trial of the case, Defendant

23

no longer her® sought to introduce evidence about illegal

24
25

surveillance at the Desert inn in Las Vegas.

Kolod who is

The material

was submitted to the Trial Court in camera and it was held they

1

relevant and evidence with respect to them could not be

2

introduced.
Thereafter, while the case was pending before the

3
4

10th Circuit Court of Appeals, the Government disclosed that

3

it had additional files relating the conversations overheard at |

€

the Desert

7

to examine this material in camera and that Court found nothing

8

admissible in the additional material.

The case was remanded to the District

I should make it plain that these earlier disclosures

13

of surveillance material are not now involves:., since Kolod has

14

died, and they related only to him.

15

There is nothing new before

the Court relating to the electronics surveillance material

16

which was considered by the courts below.

17

new problem.

?8

We now have, a wholly

I mention that4background partly to avoid misunder­

19

standing and partly because that issue, whether considered

20

by the Court in camera, was the issue which was presented by

21

the petition for certiorari which this Court decided in

22

October 1967.

23
24
25

Following the denial of the petition for certiorari,
counsel for Alderman and Alderisio filed a petition for rehear­
ing in which they asserted that they had reason to believe that

3

I

there was additional surveillance involving the defendant

z

Aider!sio.

3

In response to that Mr, Spritzer, Acting Solicitor

4

General, filed a paper with the Court in which he said that

5

pursuant to -the Government * s policy, it had been determined

3

that there was nothing which was arguably relevant with respect

7

to the pros ecution.

a

Q

Did that infer that there was additional surveillance?

a

A

The Court so understood it.

The fact was that there

I am trying to develop the

10

was additional surveillance,

n

chronology by which the case came along,

12

statement simply was that the Department had determined that

13

there was nothing which was arguably relevant.

14

Mr, SpritzerSs

It was on the basis of that that the Court entered

15

its order in January of this year remanding the case to the

m

District Court for an adversary hearing, and the Government

17

by that time had conceded that there was additional results

18

of electronic surveillance.

?9

It was following that order of the Court that the

20

present motion was filed which is a motion to modify the order

2!

of the Court,

22

sort this Court’s decision that -the petitioners here are

23

entitled to the independent determination of a court.

In that motion, we accept without question of anv

24

We urge,:
I
however, that this should be done in the first instance by the

25

Judge in camera, with the Judge then being free to order such
-

4

-

.?

further proceedings as he may deem necessary or appropriate as

z

a result of his examination*

3
•4

Tliis is the procedure I would point out which was
followed in this case with respect to the Kolod surveillance at

5

Las Vegas,

6

this Court denied certiorari.

7

This was directly approved by the Court belowr and

The 7th Circuit,, the Battaglia Case» which is row

8

pending before this Court on a writ of certiorari has sustained

9

such a procedure*

30

Q

Mr* Solicitor General, one must wonder why it takes

11

as long

12

bugging of this kind want on through its department.

13

we have to go through three different proceedings in three

14

different courts to have the Government admit that, there was a

15

certain amount of it in one proceeding and demy that there was

16

anything wrong, and then admit there was more of it in the

17

second proceeding, and then still more ,in the third proceeding*

IB

A

as it took the Department of Justice to find out what

Mr, Chief Justice, I airs distressed myself.

Why do

All 1 can

s3

say at any time when it has become known to ms that there has

20

been such action, prompt disclosure has been made*

21

This is a problem which was brewing for a long time.

General
22

There are clear orders of the Attorney/effective in 1965 that

23

it should not be done except in National security matters which

24

is a question involved in the next two cases, which xs not

25

involved here,
5

There is no question of National security in the

!

a

Aldermanand Alderisio cases•

3

in the Department of Justice to indicate that that order of

4

1965 has in any way been violated*

5

getting to the place where this will recede into the background.

I have found nothing in my tenure

I am hoping we are slowly

$

It first became apparent in this Court some time

7

over'two years ago in the case of Black against the United

8

States where the then Solicitor General filed a memorandum

9

which disclosed electronic surveillance*

10

n

At that time the

Attorney General had established a committee in the Department
of Justice to review every case where it was found and to make

12

a determination as to whether there was anything which was

13

arguably relevant and to make disclosure in cases where there

14

was anything arguably relevant*

15
16
17

Court has found to be inadequate? that the Department cannot
itself make that determination? and this we accept without
question*
The only issue is whether disclosure must be made

IS
19
20
21

22

23
24
25

This is the procedure which the

either in public or to the defendant and his counsel under
protective orders? or whether it is appropriate in ‘these cases
to make disclosure first to the District Judge.
I find myself with some feeling that we have made this
■

matter more difficult than if need bo.
the difficulties*

I don't want to minimise

This has been a very worrisome problem

for a long time.
6

t

2
e''*

a

But actually there are a sizable number of situations
where the procedure is established that determinations of
relevancy may be made by the District Judge in camera.

4

One which goes back quite a long way is the materials

5

which need be disclosed in response to a subpoena duces tecum.

6

A party may foe a little concerned* thinking that certain items

7

are net covered by the subpoena but not wanting to be in con­

3

tempt of court and having it found out later that he didn’t fcur;

9

in something which turned out to be relevant* and it has long

10

been the practice that in such a case a party may submit an ifcei

11

to the Court for the Court to determine whether it is within

12

the scope of the subpoena.
In the exeas of discovery under Rule 16 of the Federal

13
14

Rules of Criminal Procedure this Court has specifically author1

IS

ized a procedure under which the material is shown to the Distr;. ct

16

Judge in camera* and the Judge determines whether it is relevant

17

or not.
There is a case in which the Government will file a

18

19

brief in opposition today»

20

printed brief here now* but the Government Printing Office

21

not delivered it.

22

Mr. Williams* and it -is only illustrative? it is not a major

23

matter.

I had hoped that I would have the

But it was a case involving a bank robbery.

Brady decision of this Court held that exculpatory material of

of the Government must be disclosed by the defense,

3

material to the Court stating in its brief -that much of it was

not relevant; to this matter*

of it over to the defense and refused to turn over toe other ports

saying that they were in no way relevant-, 'and the identity

provided that the United States shall deliver by the statuta,

inspection of the Court; in camera

Mr, Solicitor General, is there any significance in

20

the distinction that here we are dealing with something that

21

the Government obtained illegally, and that in none of those

22

other instances that is true?

23
24
25

Ii
&

1 think there is probably some, distinction,

trying to suggest that any of these are conclusive*

I am not I
I
I am

trying to say that there are a number of situations where the

8

1

determination is made by the Judge in camera without an adversary
[

2

and 1 think that there are arguments which lead to the ccnclu- j

3

sion that that should be the procedure for review.
Q

4
S

For example, there is no issue comparable to the

deterrent issue which gets involved in this situation, is there{

6

A

No, sir, I don’t believe there is on any of them.

7

On the

8

with respect to the protection of third parties as there is in

9

the fourth of these that I was goingto present, which is the

other hand,there is no issue in those particular cases

10

matter of testimony before grand j aries, which in some ways has

11

a good deal of parallel with -this.
Q

12

Is there anything comparable in the Fourth Amendment .

13

in search and seizure where the Court has said before we

14

turn these things back, we will take a look at -them and see

15

whether they are material or not and not provide the same

16

information?

17

A

No, Mr. Chief Justice, unless we get to the problem

13

of standing, to which I am going to turn in a moment.

19

Court may say the persons seeking to have this material sup­

20

pressed have no standing to do so, in which case it will not

2!

be turned back.

The

The matter of access to grand jury testimony has a

22
23

mild

parallel with what is involved here.

There the rule was

24

*
for a long, long time that there could be no access to grand
/

25

jury testimony.

It was secret.
9

The proceedings of grand juries

were secret

1

The Court has broken that down in the Dennis case

2
3

and other decisions#

But in the process it recognised, that it ;

4

was not appropriate simply to turn over the minutes of

5

the Grand Jury to the defendants•

6

decided that the District Judge should examine the minutes of

7

the Grand Jury and should not turn over testimony in the minutes

The Court has explicitly

*

8

which is not relevant to the particular issue with which the

9

defense is concerned at the time, and has specifically -referred

10

to the fact that the necessity of protecting not only other

11

witnesses, but also third parties whose names might have been

12

mentioned in the Grand Jury proceedings, but who perhaps were

13

not indicted for one reason or another, and that isdone by the

14

Judge ex parte#
It also seems to ms that perhaps we have considered

15

16

the problem in too broad a way# and in that respect# I found some

17

passages in Mr# William®& brief which seem to me to be quite

13

relevant#
On page 5 of his brief ha says, "If the FBI had

19
20

ransacked petitioner Alderisio's home and taken his private

21

papers without warrant or other process, could it decline to

22

produce them in Court?"1

23
24
25

This seems to narrow the contention

to his, which would be specifically Mderisio's, own conversafelons#

If we narrow this to -the portions of conversations to

which Alderisio was a party on one side or the other, we have
10

1

already considered a considerable part of the material*

2

Q

Do you Hieasi to soy that you would agree that a trans­

3

cript of such a conversation should he turned over to the

4

defendant?
A

3

1 am not saying that*

1 am trying to narrow the issue

X would still like to have some ground to stand on

6

to that*

7

to say that oven in such cases it may be appropriate for the

a

Judge to say that it is irrelevant* but if the contention is

9

limited simply to Aider!sio'a own conversation* the problem is

10

a good deal easier*
Q

11
12

Do you read Mr* William's brief as indicating that he

is arguing only for such conversations?

A

13

I don't regard him as bound by ‘‘chat statement.

1

14

just' notice! that as X was reading it.

15

to which I shall refer which seem to me to be a parallel to

16

that*

17

There are ether passages

Similarly# on pages 16 and 17 of his brief he refers to the

18

proceedings in the local court# 1 believe in the Black case#

19

and at the bottom of page 16 and at the top of page 17# he says#

20

wBased upon further probing and further argument# the Court

21

made some limited excision princially of material in the

22

AirTel memorandum which had a live informant source*•

23

Now# 1 would simply point out that in that case some

24

part of it. has been held to be irrelevant# and I don't regard

25

that ss of great importance*

.11

-

:S

On page 22 of his brief, the last paragraph at the

t
2

bottom of the page, “The arrant gossip rationale is quickly

3

disposed of if we consider that the petitioners themselves either

4

heard or made the scandalous references to third parties uttered

3

while they were present.”
That seems to narrow the contention to conversations

S
7

of which the defendants here were parties on one side or the

8

other*
This gets me to the issue of standing which was

raised in the order setting the case down for rehearing*

That

problem presents some difficulties and embarrassment for counsel
who are representing the Government in cases of this sort*

1

think the difficulty and embarrassment of Mr. Alexander, who
was appearing in the District Court, are apparent on pages
14 and 15*
The problem is that if you could only disclose this
material you could show how utterly irrelevant it is, but if you
disclose it, you have defeated the whole objective of trying
not to disclose it*
I think it can be said that xm have made rightly or
wrongly a sort of compromise in this case*

We have made what

amounts to a partial disclosure*
1 had a good deal of concern before we went that far, but
X thought we had to*
In the footnote at the bottom of page 2 of our brief,

12

-

1

we have stated our landstanding of the situation hers which is *

2

one t. that there were no overhearings whatever of Mr. Alderman.

3

There is

4

with respect to Mr* Alderisio* we have in effect disclosed the

5

places whsfe the overhearing was.

6

7
0

information with respect to Mr* Alderman* and that

by associates of his or firms that employed him* and where
he did not have desk space.
Similarly, in another case which is pending before
the 'COtirfc on petition for certiorari* we have disclosed the
time*si; of the overhearings in an effort to show that

11

approximate

12

they could not have been relevant.
With respect to Alderman* whose conversations were not

ises which were not his but were business establishments owned

10

j

heard and whose premises were not affected, it is our position
that he has no standing to object to the evidence to the failure,
to disclose with respect to conversations of Aider!sib.
0

Would any statements made by Alerisio at that partic­

ular time be admissible against Alderman in a conspiracy case?
A
-' Q
A

i think not* Mr. Chief Justice*
Why not?
The only question in tills case is whether there is

anything here which led to other evidence* whether any evidence
was used against Alderman was the fruit of -the poisonous tree*
Our position is* even though it was illegal with respect to
Aider!si©* even though there must be disclosure with

13

1

respect to Alderisio, Alderman has no standing to raise that

question«

It would be our position that if there was a third

no standing in this case»

q

what about conversations where he was present?

That gets harder#

I think there we might say that

he has standing, but we still have the issue of relevancy which 1

we contend should be determined by the District Judge in

were not his places of business, but business establishments

17

18

he himself was not present because in the very brief filed

19

by the Government at page 21 of the Government's brief, they

say,

going to give them back to the victim of this electronic

How can the Judge know whether the

failure to disclose the logs f memoranda and records of the

4

cation of his constitutional rights?

5

They go on to say at page 15;

"There are decisions where

6

even the disclosure of a conversation that is innocuous on

7

its face can prejudice third-party defendants."

8
9

I say mutatis mutandis.

I say there are conversations

which are perfectly innocuous on their fact which may be

10

lethal in suggesting igads to evidence gathered by law enforce-

11

ment evidence for presentation to the Grand Jury and for

12

subsequent presentation to the Trial Court.

13

They say at page 15 » "The experience of the Department

14

of Justice in reviewing cases involving electronic surveillance

15

to determine when disclosure must be made has indicated that

16

because the factual sitatuions are so varied, it is almost

impossible to draw a general rule of disclosure that can be

Honor, is that C is a defendant in a criminal proceeding who

In the case that you hypthosised A and C are not

In this frame of reference, I say that in the

hierarchy of values, the Court should place A and B’s rights

subordinate to C.

If A and B were indicted, and they were

seeking the vindication of their constitutional rights, I would

have a different answer for them, but I stand by what I said

earlier, sir, having taken as the fact the unconstitutional

invasion of all three, that is, between A anci B and C, and we

are talking about a common law right to privacy, A and B against

C, and that can be safeguarded in so far as practical for the

vindication of C's rights by a protective order that inhibits

both C and his counsel from making unnecessary disclosure of

the contents of that conversation.

12

Q

Just in a word, what is the violation of A and B's

constitutional rights ?
A

In a word, Your Honor, the Government illegally

13

and unconstitutionally listened to conversations which they

14

believed were being privately held and has been said in

15

Silverman against the United States.

16

Q

It is a Katz sort of case?

Katz, Silverman, Wong Sun and Irvine.

Is that subject to C's consent?

Wo, sir, not by C's consent.

21

going to have a conversation, and they come and listen, even

22

though A and B participate?

A

If I understand your question, are you asking

whether C could give consent to the Government to electronica11 Y
monitor A and B’s conversation without notifying them that
- 30 -

I

■

8

their privacy was being invaded?

I would say no, it must be

2

where the parties to the conversation cannot reasonably foresee

o

that they are going to be overheard in the normal course of

4

things„
Now, with respect to the problem of standing that

tj

%J

s?

has been raised here, it is our contention, and 1 have, I

7

think, articulated that in response to Mr. Justice Fortas•

8

question, 'that Alder is io has standing with respect to conver­

9

sations heard on his premises, notwithstanding the fact that

10

he was not present.

11

I read page 21 of the Solicotor’s brief as a con­

12

cession of that position.

13

is necessary for the simple reason that if we are to make the

14

fruits of an unconstitutional invasion of one's premises

15

admissible, it follows clearly we must make the conversation

18

seised on Aider!sios premises inadmissible against him.

17

Q

1 think a concession of this sort

The fact is,it was not Alderisio's premises or

18

any premises lie had an interest in.

Then I gather you would

To answer your questions as sharply as it was posed.

22

Your Honor, yes, I would take that position, and I underscore

23

that section of your question which said in which he had

24

no interest,

Q

For myself at. least the Government has introduced

31

something here which I did not know was an issue in the case,

2

namely, that these were not Alderisio's premises.

the original order was written on the premises.

the search is directed

to

whether it is identified or unidentified at the time of the

11

search.

12

Q

I know, but still I want to be clear about this.

13

If the fact is that these conversations with Alderisio that

14

were illegally bugged were conversations on premises not

55

his own, then you would limit your demand, I gather, not his

16

own or which he had no interest to conversations of his own

17

or conversations in his present; is that right?

So in the case, for example, of Alderman, against

Alderman to Alderisio, and the unindicted conspirators to sash,

and since it takes the partnership theories and lays all of

will deter electronic surveillance because I suggest that the

rule for which the Government contend is now archaic.
Q

18

, chink i must have misunderstood you a moment ago.

19

Did you say any person against whom electronic surveillance

20

is directed has standing?

21

that?

22

directed against A that he has standing even though he may be

23

a total stranger to the conversations and the premises and no

24

co-defendant or co-conspirator is involved?

25

-Do you take a position as broad as

Do you say if there were unlawful electronic surveillances

:

If neither his conversation is not heard or his

33

1

premises are not invaded;, if he is not the subject matter of

2

the conversation and if he is not a co-defendant with one whose

3

conversations, premises or privacy were invaded, then I say

4

he does not have standing.

5

Q

You inserted one word ingredient.

You inserted,"If

6

he is the subject of the conversation, even though it is

7

between total strangers, then he is entitled to disclosure. ■'

0

A

Yes.

9

Q

So that is another ingredient?

10

A

That is another ingredient, and I think that is the

ii

ingredient on which we part company with the Government in

12

this proceeding, as I understand their briefs.

13

14

I see that my time is up with respect to this case.
The next case set is Ivanov.

I hope to develop the

15

question of standing fully in that companion case to this.

16

So, I will defer, with the Court's indulgence, by discussion

17

of standing until that case is called.
