ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD A. JACKS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. JACKS:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the
*

10

Court.
I believe we have made arrangements, the petitioner

11
12
13

in the Solicitor General's office, for the use of a diagram,
if we may, that the Marshal is bringing in at this' moment.
I may just in advance say that this is an action for

14

16
17

20

just compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the United
States Constitution.

It arises out of the United States Army's

seizure and use of private property, in this case buildings,
belonging to the Petitioners, during the Panamanian riots of
1962.
The issue before this Court, as we view it, is whether
the Court of Claims correctly held that U. S. military forces
may seize and use private property without incurring a duty to
provide compensation under the Fifth Amendment whenever they
are faced with a "immediate necessity.”
The facts are as follows:

25

If I may briefly refer to

1

ito

This is a chart that was prepared by the United States

z

Government for presentation in the organisation of American

3

states following the Panamanian riots in the course of a

4

charge that the United States was the aggressor in these riots.

Its accuracy has been stipulated to.

The buildings that are here (indicating)are the real

property in question.

12

11th Street, and down Bolivar Avenue.

13

This is the Canal Zone and this is the Republi

On the eveni.ng in question, January 9, 1964, the

14

United States Military Forces were called to;this end of the

15

zone in response to a request from the Civilian. Command and

16

ordered to clear the Zone of rioters.

17

The United States Army troops, starting here on Front

18

Street, moved down 11th Street, cleared the Zone of rioters

19

moved behind the YMCA and Masonic Temple, had bri.ef scuffles

20

with rioters who were then in both of those buildings, evicted

21

22
23

24
25

them, moved them out to the streets, and took up position,
stationed troops on the boundaries in the middle of the street
just inside the Border on the boundary line.
This is approximately from 10 to midnight on the
night of January 4.

Shortly after midnight they began to

receive sniper fire directed at the troops stationed in front

of the building»

Q

Right next to it?

A

Right next to it.

The Masonic Temple forms the

building inside the right angle at that point.
Q

Is that involved in the litigation?

A

Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice, both the Masonic

Temple and the YMCA are petitioners in this action.

The troops

were stationed along Bolivar and 11th Street and began to
receive sniper fire and at that point the local commander
ordered them to withdraw into the YMCA, the Masonic Temple and
the Old Commissary.
Throughout the night snipers continued to harass the
Army troops inside the building.

In the morning of the 10th

the mob began to form, over here on Bolivar Avenue and directed
a concentrated Molotov cocktail attack first at the YMCA where
a Company of 140 men of troops were housed.
4

1

They finally about two o8 clock in the afternoon of

2

the 10th succeeded in setting it on fire# forcing the troops

to evacuate at which point they moved down the street and began.

I can’t read your legend from here but what does

that mean, those diagonal lines?
A

That says buildings looted and damaged or burned.

This is attached to the Appendix, Mr» Chief Justice»
the last page of the Appendix.
?

It is

1

On the basis of these facts the Court of Claims held

2

that there was no liability for the seizure and use of these

3

buildingsj that is, the YMCA and the Masonic Temple, holding

4

hat there was no liability for occupancy of private property

S

which is immediately necessary for the safety of troops or to

6

meet an emergency threatening great public danger.

7

Judge Davis dissented.

Judge Davis said that on his

8

basis of the applicable case law he thought it clear that the

8

Government is liable where it first takes the property for its

10

own military use and then exposes the place to enemy attack or

11

evokes it leading to injury or destruction.

12

In this connection* Judge Davis said* and we should

13

emphasise this* there is no exception from liability as I

14

read the materials for temporary seizures for military use in

15

the face of eminent hostility or to meet an emergency.

16
17
18
19

Once the property is taken for a military use the
Government is responsible for its subsequent injury no matter
how quickly that follows upon seizure.
Thus* in our view the issue here between the majority

20

and the dissent below centers on the all important question of

21

whether the immediate necessity or eminent hostility creates

22

an exception in the general duty to provide compensation.

23
24
25

We think it does not and cannot* that the Court of
Claims' decision if allowed to stand creates a grave and
unwarranted threat to the citizen's right of: compensation.
8

For if an immediate necessity is sufficient to confer

'I

2

absolute immunity upon the Government whenever it seizes and

3

use private property, then we are indeed faced with a new era

4

of governmental power..

5

Q

Is your qi^esfcion here, or at lea:?t one of the

6

questions here whether this indeed constituted

7

Government followed by the damage or whether it was damage

8

incurred in the course of a military or quasi-military operation ?
A

9

seizure by the

Mo, Mr, Justice, I would characterize the

10

factual element of the issue as to whether there i was a seizure

11

and a use for a military purpose and we take the position as

12

that expressed by Judge Davis below that once there is a

13

seizure and use by the U.S. Armed Forces for military purpose

14

there is liability no matter how the damage occurs.
Q

drawn up in the street outside of these two buildings but the
mob then attacked, throwing Molotov cocktails and doing whatever
they did.
The troops then retired into these two buildings, the
conflict continued.

Damage resulted to the buildings.

Would

you still contend that the United States must pay you for the
damage done?
A

Yes, your Honor, although that is not the facts

in this case.

9

Q

1 understand that.

A

But I would contend that there would be»

Well, now tell me why?

it took those buildings -----

Once the Army retired into those buildings as part of

1$

Well# then don't say it„

its protective operation»
A

12

1 would say there would be liability because by

13

so doing under the established case law it then exposes those

14

buildings to special response on the part of the opposing

15

forces»

Q

What you are saying then amounts to the propo­

sition that in any riot situation any building to which is
physically occupied# which is physically occupied by the
military forces of the United States falls within this category?
that is to say# that the United States is liable for the
damage inflicted upon that building by the attacking mob,
A

I would say# Mr» Justice# may I qualify that,

I don't think that I would make quite that broad a statement.
Q

Now this to me is a critical area.

A

Right»
10

?
2
3
4

Q

What do you think constitutes a compensible

taking in a riot situation and which you don't?
A

I would say the criteria would be as follows,

Mr. Justice,

5

First of all, there must be a necessity which justi-»

S

fies the seizure, not going to whether duty of compensation is

7

available but whether there is authority to take it.

a

use must be actual and not constructive or passive.

0

I mean the Army has to withdraw into the building, use it as

Then the
By that

10

a Command Post, a defense fortress, an observation post, as

11

opposed to merely standing in front of the building or passing

12

through for 30 seconds.

13

Then the use that the Army, thirdly, gets out of that

14

building, must have some benefit to the Government, as was

15

present in this case.

16

but it must have a benefit to the Government.

17

It can also have a benefit to the owner

Then I should suggest fourthly that that benefit

18

should relate to the specific mission that the Army is involved

19

in in that particular case, as it was here.

20

And then finally, that use should be of sufficient

21

scope and duration.

22

each case but to make it clear that it was more than fleeting

23

or merely consequential! in this case the Masonic Temple was

25

Wow this will depend upon the facts in

occupied for a period of 7 days, the YMCA for a substantial
period of time until the troops were forced to evacuate.

11

1

Q

These are not simple standards?

2

A

No, your Honor»

3

Q

Now let me just put

this to you very simply

4

because we are not engaged in what

S

exchange of verbal dialogue here»

6

riot situations that the country witnessed the summer before

7

last or so and ifet us suppose that the United States troops are

8

there and they are in the street, and the mob is throwing

9

Molotov cocktails and stones and shooting and doing whatever

is entirely anacademic
Let v.s take one of these

they did»
Let us then suppose that the troops retire into or
take refuge in or go into* go into let us say, a building, and
from that building they take defense, they observe the mob and
take defensive action or whatever you want to call shooting guns
at people in those circumstances.
Now in your submission to the Court is that a compensible taking and if it is not a compensible taking, what
are the elements which distinguish that case from your case?
A

I would say that is a compensible taking,

Mr» Justice, and that the elements are substantially similar
to those involved here,
Q

And if we should disagree with you on the case

that I put to you then we would have to disagree with you on
the case submitted to us by adjudication?
A

Not necessarily, Mr» Justice, because I think
12

1

this is a stronger case.

2

iisrfe were held for a substantial period of time in which there

*r>

Here we are involved with buildings

was a substantial number of men involved, which were used

4

throughout the riots and here we have, although we don’t think

5

it is necessary to make out liability, here we have a fairly

6

strong evidence, of a causal connection between the seizure and

7

the resulting destruction, the point being that just the

8

buildings occupied by the troops as indicated by the hash mark»

S

are the ones that were substantially destroyed.
Q

10

Well I may be wrong on this but ray recollection

11

of reading the documents here is that the damage to the Masonic

12

Building occurred after the troops had retired into that,

13

after the YMCA building was set on fire?
A

14

No, your Honor, if X may correct you on the

15

record.

16

rioters in the Masonic Temple and the YMCA that -were looting

17

and somewhat destroying the interior when the Army first

18

arrived.

13

The facts are that the Masonic Temple — there were

They moved those rioters out of the buildings.

We

20

don’t make any claim for that damage.

21

positions in the streets and they were subsequently forced to

22

retire into both buildings at once.

23

and the YMCA and the damage to those structures by Molotov

24

cocktail occurred the day and the second day.

25

Q

The Army then took up

That is, the Masonic Temple

Why don’t you make a claim for that part of the
13

1

damage inflicted in the initial phases of the operation that

2

was inflicted by the Armyt, let us say , or by the exchange of

3

civilities between the Army and the mob?
A

4

Well, because, your Honor, that damage, to be

5

precise if 1 may, on the basis of the record, that initial

6

damage was all done by the rioters.

7

were looting the interiors of the buildings and the Army moved

S

them out.
And so there is no damage really done by the Army.

9

Q

1©
11

14
15

IS
17

Let ms ask you one more question, and then I

will leave you alone.

\

Do I understand from your last statement then that

12
13

They had got in and they

if the rioters had been in the building, and the Army had moved
in troops to roust them, and the Army had inflicted damage on
the building in the course of that operation, by shooting with
less than television western movie accuracy, for example, that
in your submission the Army would have been liable for the
resulting damage?

18
19

A

It would not have bean liable, your Honor,

Q

It would not?

A

It would not because there was no use made of

because
20
21

22

that building, your Honor.

That building is really in that case:

23

a random consequence of battle.

That just happened to be in

24

the way 6£ the exchange.

But the Army never seizued and used

25

14

1

that building.
I think the key is the Army has to take and retire to

2

3

and use, and at that point as Judge Davis said liability

4

attaches.

the record, which is stipulated to.

That

is

spelled

out on

That is the reason the Army

withdrew into the building, to protect the troops.
Q

Well, if they had withdrawn the troops from

around the building and back down that street, what would
happen to those two buildings?
A

If they had been destroyed there would be no

claim here.
22
23
24

Q

Would

they have been destroyed?

A

It is

not clear.

Q

Well,

did either the Masonic Temple or the

Q

Yes.

Yes, they did, your Honor»

10
11
12
13

They needed the Army to

protect those buildings or they wouldn5! be protected, and if
they had stayed outside the buildings to protect the buildings
you would have no claim, but if they go inside the building
for the same purpose of protecting it you do have a claim»
A

14
15

Oh, you mean privately»

Mr»

May I rephrase my answer to that question,

Justices

16

Q

It would help.

A

I think that they withdrew into the building to

17

protect the troops primarily»

If they had not gone into the

18

ID

buildings and the buildings had been lost there would be no
claim.

20
For example, there were troops stationed all behind
21

here but never in these two buildings here.

Yet these buildings

22
were never destroyed.

We don’t contend that it is necessary

23

tc show that the mob moved just against the buildings the Army
24

occupied to make out our test, because once there is seizure
25

16

1

2

and use there is liability.

But we think that is an important

'point.

3

Q

What if they had retired behind the building

4

so to keep the building between them and the rioters in the

S

process of trying to shell or shoot the troops had destroyed

6

the building?

7

A

Then I would not be making a claim here todays,

a

Mr. Justice.

9

that that falls within the true battle damage situation.

10

Q

II

protection?

12

A

1 would contend, although 'that is a close question

But they were still using the building for

In the facts of this case 1 think that could be

13

argued both ways.

If you could show that they put the buildings

14

up as a buffer, that they in effect deliberately sacrificed

15

them to protect the troops, then I think we would have Caltex

16

and we would be prepared to argue as we do in Point No. 2 of

17

our brief, that Caltex should be overruled.

18

Q

As long as it stands you couldn't recover it?

19

A

Not without overruling Caltex I believe in that

20

case, if they sacrificed the buildings to protect the troops.

21

But, of course, we contend that is not the fact.

OML ARGUMENT OF PETER L. STRAUSS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

3

MR. STRAUSS;

4
5

6

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
Petitioners seek to recover from the United States in

7

this case the value not of the use of their buildings but of

8

the damage which rioters inflicted on those buildings during

9

the course of general anti-American riots in the Canal Zone.

10

The President, the Congress and this Court have

11

unanimously agreed on the legal principle which ought to apply

12

in that situation.

13

And I should like to quote it.

It is a general principle of both international and

14

municipal law that all property is held subject not only to

15

be taken by the Government for public use, in which case under

IS

the Constitution of the United States, the owner is entitled

17

to just compensation, but also subject to be temporarily

18

occupied, which is this case, or even actually destroyed,

19

which is perhaps Caltex and is not involved here.

In times of

In this latter case governments do not admit a legal
obligation on their part to compensate the owner.
That statement as the Court may recognise from the
Court of Claims' opinion in this case originated in the veto
message from President Grant to the Congress.
18

It was then

1

quoted with approval in the Lawrence Report, House Report 134

2

of the 43rd Congress, Second Session, which is the most thorough

3

congressional study ever undertaken of Government liability for

4

damage claims and which has acquired independent stature as a

source book on international law in this area»
This Court then adopted this in the Pacific Railroad

taking»

temporary occupancy of premises under the immediate compulsion

of the public emergency and for the purpose of dealing with
that emergency is not a constitutional taking for which com­
pensation is required.
Nox* I think counsel has fairly stated most of the

13
14
15

relevant facts but there are a few additional things which I
would like to emphasize.
First, it is quite clear from the record these riots

17

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

It remains the Government's contention today that the

started well before the troops arrived, two or three hours
earlier.

The troops arrived down in this area and at the time

they arrived there were rioters throughout this general area.
There were no rioters down here.
The troops came and they found the rioters at the
buildings for which Petitioners are now claiming compensation.
Then when the sniper firing started and it wasn't only sniper
firing, the Court of Claims is quite clear, the record is quite
clear that Molotov cocktails were being thrown while the troops
19

1

were on the streets, the Amy fell back from its positions and

2

it did not do so only along Bolivar Avenue, into these two

3

buildings, it was forced to fall back into the Commissary

4

Building, it was forced to fall back here where you can see

S

Q

I can't see,,

You are between me and the chart»

6

A

It was forced to fall back here where you can

7

see there are not many buildings, in general along the boundary,

8

behind the railroad tracks, and there are photographs in the

9

exhibits of record in the court, not reproduced in the joint

10
11

appendix, which shows the bunker positions built with sand bags
behind these railroad tracks»
That left the troops behind the sanitation building

14
15

21

here.

There were no troops in the sanitation building»

That

did not stop the rioters from burning the sanitation building»
During the course of the riots the sanitation building was
completely destroyed.
So it seems to us that this indicates the negative
of the Petitioners' theory, that there would have been no
burnings had the troops not been in their building»
It certainly also indicates the negative of the
theory that it was to these two buildings particularly that the
presence of the troops drew the rioters' attack.

The rioters

were all along the boundary line although from the start they
were concentrated principally in what we call the salient.
They didn’t favor any buildings particularly with
20

1

their attack»

2

Q

They made their attack throughout.
Suppose the Army,, a month, in advance of this

3

trouble, had said we foresee that there is going to be trouble

4

and we, therefore, will occupy these two buildings.

5
6

A

Well, I think we would have a much different

Q

I know it would be different.

case.

7

And I appreciate

8

your agreeing with me but would that be a compensible taking

8

in the constitutional sense1?

10

A

I think it would be.

11

Q

And that campense and the payment for that would

12

have to cover the consequential damages, wouldnst it, or would

13

it?

14

A

It is not clear the extent to which it would.

15

I may say that the damage issue, how much ought to be paid if

16

there was a taking in this case is not settled on this record

17

and there would be required some further proceedings to settle

18

that question.

19

20
21

And we do concede that the rioters did the amount
of damage the petitioners claim they did.
Q

If the Army a month in advance had occupied

22

these buildings and the riots had occurred and the rioters

23

had destroyed the buildings.

24

question as to whether the Government would have to pay the

25

total cost of the building as distinguished from just

Do you think it is an open

21

1

compensation for use and occupancy without taking into account

2

the damage done by the rioters?

3

A

The Government would be liable.

And if the

4

Court concludes that there is a taking in this case, of course,

5

the Government would be liable.

6

Q

No, no, no.

That is not my question.

7

A

Yes, sir.

8

Q

Wait a minute.

9

The critical question is whether the Government would

I agree.
Wait a minute.

10

be liable in that situation for the destruction of

11

building which was brought about as a result of the conflict

12

between the rioters and the troops.

13

A

the

It seems to me there would be a difficult

14

factual question but one which might possibly foe resolved as

15

to what damage would have occurred had the troops not been

16

there and that if it could be determined, that some damage

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

would have occurred had the troops not been there that damage
would be subtracted.
But otherwise I would agree with the proposition
that the Government would be liable.
Q

I am not sure that I would, but you say that

the Government would be liable for the carnage that occurred
in the course of the riot, less such part of that damage as
could be shown to be not attributable to Government occupancy?
A

If I may explain the basis on which I do that
22

t

it seems to me ----

2

Q

Well, that is what you are saying, isn't it?

3

A

That, is what I am saying and I am saying it

4

because it seems to me you have your finger on the distinction

5

which is crucial to the so-called target doctrine on which

6

petitioners may rely „

1

Under that doctrine as petitioners have already

S

argued, if the Government makes a target, of a particular

0

building by turning it into a fortification£, then in principles

10'

of international law, at least, although it has not been held

11

in the domestic contacts, the Government is liable for the

12

damages done.

13

But it is quite clear that

in this case no such

14

target was made.

15

work petitioners cite, the State is responsible for the use

16

and occupation of buildings and 3:eaX property only if they

17

are being used in more than a temporary way and the use is not

18

For as Professor Borchard points out in the

impelled by military necessity, thus he says,

19

’’The target doctrine extends only to property

20

occupied in advance of actual fighting, rather

21

than such as is occupied daring an attack or

22

retreat. *'

23

So that even conceding as I have, the answer to your

24
25

question, the established principles applicable in this case
require that no compensation be paid.

23

There is nothing in the

1

record to suggest that there was any previous use of these

2

buildings 0

3

There were riots in the Canal Zone in 1959.

1 have

4

looked into them and so far as 1 can determine there was no

5

use made of these buildings at that time.

6

It seems to me that the principal task I have to

7

carry out here is to make a case for what we have called the

8

public emergency statute for what President Grant referred to

9

as this exception for temporary use during and under the com-'

10
11

12
13

pulsion of war.
And to do that I have to start, at some distance from
ordinary Fifth Amendment concepts.
In particular,, I want to look at the body of law

14

*hich would ordinarily govern the riot situation.

15

say, municipal liability for tort.

16

That is to

If a person's property were destroyed because the

17

police failed to protect it at all or withdrew from the area

18

when the rioters seemed to be getting the upper hand he might

19

file a claim on the theory the police hadn't given him adequate

20

protection, or he might make the same claim if he thought that

21

because police used tear gas or Billie clubs, instead of rifles

22

or machineguns on looters looting went unchecked and indeed

23

there are many such claims which had been filed in New York

24

and in other cities which were the subject of urban riots.

25

Those claims are tort claims.

24

And it is apparent

1

that in the absence of statutory liability for riot damage

2

generally those claims could not succeed.

3

The decisions made whether to use guns or not;, where

4

is the most effective place from which to fight a riot, how

5

is the most effective way to deal with it are quite plainly

6

discretionary functions of Government for which no Government

7

concedes tort or other liability.

8
S

Under Federal law for example any such liability
would be foreclosed under the Tort Claims Act.

And the reasons

10

for denying liability and not that no loss has occurred, it

11

is rather the desire to avoid any interference with official

12

action, but even the prospect of the litigation or liability

13

might bring.

14

It is to permit the officers to concentrate ex­

15

clusively on the most efficient way of dealing with the danger.

16

The public necessity exception can be viewed as an extension

17
18

of this discretionary function reasoning.
By excusing policemen or troops from eminent domain

19

liability from entering buildings in the heat of emergency

20

and for emergency purposes it, too, protects their decisions

21

22
23
24
25

from unwanted influence.
Had the troops in this case simply left the buildings
tc the mob there would have been no liability; had they used
weapons which kept the mob away from the buildings there would
have been no liability.
25

i

Indeed it is significant to what the real charac­

2

terization of this case ought to be, the petitioners make no

3

claim for the value of the use of their premises for what

4

would be the ordinary Fifth Amendment measure of relief.
They say the troops had a right to be there.

5

They

8

seek only to recover the damage done by the rioting mob, when

1

the troops were unable to control them with the weapons their

8

commander allowed them to use.

8

Thus, petitioners seek the damage which Mew York

10

Merchants will be unable to obtain and should be unable to

11

obtain because of the discretionary function.
We believe it is as important to foreclose the possi­

12
13

bility of liability here.

20

there any at all, were they entitled to any compensation it

21

would have to be measured by the value of the use of those

22

seven days of the building and not at all by the value of

23
24
25

the damage that was done?
A

The closest cases this court — the closest

this Court's case has come to that question were the leasehold

26
I

.1

cases that arose out of World War II, such as the General Motors,

2

case, and in those cases the Court seemed to be saying that

3

you didn’t simply get the amount of money that could be valued

4

for the time that the Government was there, it was -also the

5

inconvenience to the petitioner and he was entitled among other

6

things to get the premises back in the condition in which he

7

gave them to the Government.
We cannot see any particular reason for avoiding that

8
9

liability except to the extent we would, argue that the Govern­

10

ment would not be responsible if it had a leasehold for the

11

damage done by an earthquake.
Similarly it might not be responsible for the damage

12
13

done by a rioting mob, only to the extent that the Government

14

could be said to have brought that damage onto the buildings

15

was the basis behind my answer to Mr. Justice Portas, could

16

the Government be held liable for the rioting mobs down there.

17
18
19

20

23
24
25

But your claim is they aren’t liable at all?

A

No liability here at all.

And I make reference

to the failure to claim rent value only to show that this
really isn’t a Fifth Amendment claim.
It seems to us it is in everything but name a tort

21

22

Q

claim.

This is for tort damages and it looks exactly like

the claims that are arising out of the urban riots today
except for this particular characterisation that petitioners
can make and argue because troops were forced by the rioters

27

\

back into their buildings in order to be able to carry out

2

their function of protecting the Zone and still staying alive.

3

Q

If that is what it is in fact, the equivalent

4

of a tort claim against a municipal authority, then your war

It was close enough to being a war.

Congress hadn't even voted on it, had they?

17

A

No, they had not.

13

There have been riots such as the Harlem Riots of

19

1943 and the Cambridge, Maryland Riots two summers ago, for

20

what they considered to be good reasons the police did not go
I

21

into the riot gone but simply tried to contain the riot in

22

the area where it was occurring by protecting the fringes.

23

It seems to us that there is no apparent justice

24

in giving the protected people at the fringes of the riot area

25

a better shot at compensation for whatever damage they suffered
28

}

despite the presence of police or troops than those in the

2

riot sone who received no protection.

Since urban violence and hostility to the police go

The rule that petitioners seek might be just as

The problem of distributing them is too

No case we have discovered in this or any other

22

efforts to contain them.

25

No case we have discovered characterises Government

And this is no failure of analysis.
This is entirely consistent with the line this court

has followed in determining whether or not a taking has occurred,
Under that approach conduct which is basically tortious or
would be if it occurred between private citizens is insufficient
in itself to be a taking in the constitutional sense.

We do not believe that the Mitchell case* the Russell

Suppose they had known the Commanding General of

34

1

its the sort of case where if it occurred by itself, if it were

2

one incident, of that war with that battle were the only occasior.

3

on which damage had occurred there might be a strong tendency

4

to say that there was liability in those circumstances.

5

But, if on the other hand, it was one out of 10,000

©

operations in a huge conflict, the Court might find that his

7

visit to the cite at 12 o'clock was in itself a product of an

8

emergency that was developing at the other side of town and

8

consequently compensation need not be paid.

10

Q

What is the difference except in point of time?

11

A

As I understand the rationale of the doctrine,

12

I should say that I am perhaps giving too much credence to

13

the:se international cases involving the target doctrine.

Maybe

1 am following it too far.

Those eases arose in a special situation where you
have neutrals, foreigns living in one country which was at war
with insurgence or some other country, and the troops of the
country in which these neutrals live had to fight a battle
with their opponents and chose — and the choosing is really
the important part — and chose the place where the neutrals
lived as the place to fight their battle.
And international cases have held that in those
circumstances compensation is to be paid.

Now there is a notion

in that that the choice is an invidious one, that when the
Commander of the Government troops is thinking where shall I

25

35

1

fight., he may make the decision 1 would rather fight where it

2

is not my people's property being damaged? I would rather fight

3

on the land of the Imperialist Sugar Company or something to

4

that fashion.
And this rule of compensation was fashioned and

S
6

applied entirely in cases which might be considered Imperialist

7

cases.

8

resisting liability, and European and American Governments on

9

the other -— North American Governments on the other hand

10

They involved Latin American Government on the one hand

insisting upon liability.

11

As we cited in our brief there are a number of other

12

cases which refused to apply the dcctrine and refused to apply

13

it because the property of the natives was equally exposed to

14

the risk of harm.

15

in other words.
So that is a doctrine which arises not only out of

16
17

There wasn't any discrimination in this case,

the fact of choice but also out of the existence of discrimi­

18

nation.

Perhaps I should insist that the possibility of dis­

19

crimination should be there as well as the factor of choice.

20

But the thing which distinguishes the question you

21

put to me, Mr. Justice Black, in this case is the factor of

22

choice.

23
24
25

That at least in that case one could say that the

General had visited the area, had looked it over, and had
said, "Here we fight."
Whereas in this case there is no such factor.

Do I understand also, Mr. Strauss, the troops

They were already in the building and they had

to put them out

in order to defend the building as well as to

protect their own lives.

That is right, but they did not stay in the

building at that time so far as the record shows.

The border between the gone and the Republic is

that street, Bolivar?

A

Yes, in part,

Right there where the YMCA building is, Bolivar

3

Street..

Right down the middle of the street?

4

A

Down the middle of the street.

5

Q

Or is one side or the other of the street?

S

A

It is a very free access.

Part of the reason

\

1

for that which doesn't show on this map, is that Colon, which

0

shows here as the Republic of Panama is on the peninsula.

9

This is its only land border here.

So that this corridor down

10

here is the only access which the citizens of Colon have to

11

other parts of Panama.

It is Panamanian.

12

The map continues more or less like my hand with sea

13

around it on those sides and then this is the border which you

14

see here.
Q

15

And the rioters, they did more than just throw

1G

things across or shoot across, they came across themselves did

17

they?

18

A

They were trying to come across, yes.

They were

19

in the Zone and they repeatedly tried to attack the Zone, and

20

they also attacked although they did not succeed in burning,

21

they attacked a small building down here, they attacked some­

22

thing which you will find referred to as the Old Fire House

23

which is this building here.

24

They were burning railroad ties along here.

25

Q

Now they did so by throwing Molotov cocktails

38

1

across or by coming across themselves?
A

2

Welly they would run up»

There was at one point j
■

3

an effort fcc push a burning car across the boundary here»

4

difficulty was that the tear gas that the troops were using

5

couldn't keep the rioters far enough from the building to

6

keep them out of the reach of the Molotov cocktails.

7

I think one can put it that way»

8

12

Had they been using

something with a little longer reach, a 30-30, they raight have

Q

n

The

Mr. Strauss, is there anything in the record to

s how that when the troops went there they intended to use the
YMCA building or the Masonic Temple as a rendezvous for the
troops?
A

No, not that I am aware of»

There is one other

matter that I should point out about the facts, as long as
counsel has mentioned it, I would just like to stress it.

The

YMCA and the Masonic Temple are separate entities.
They are represented by one counsel.

But they are

S8
19

20

otherwise separate and this business of observation post and
command post applies only to the Masonic Temple.

Troops were

in the YMCA for only 12 hours and there is no indication that
21

during the 12 hours they were there that any command function
22
or similar function was performed.
23

In conclusion, I would just like to state again
24

You say they were there 12 hours?

that when tha troops in the street in front of these buildings
.

began to receive sniper fire that it was a prudent decision to
withdraw into these buildingsP one»
Two, the Masonic Temple as I alluded to earlier is
particularly well suited for a command and observation post
because it is the highest building in that area and if the
court will forgive a personal reference, you will se® that you
can Bee -the

entire

Zone at that point and command whatever

action you wanted to take.
Q

Is there a fact finding?

A

The facts ——

Q

That would state the reason why they withdrew

into the buildings?
A

YeSg, Mr. Justice Brennan,, the facts, as developed

in three documents, one* the formal presentation before the
OASt by written form two, the statement of facts from the
General Counsel of the Army to me, and three the oral presen™
tafcion, all indicate as we point out in our brief that the

25

troops movec into the building to protect the troops»

2

were the statements that the United States Government has

3

given assigned as the reason for the seizure of these buildings»

4

G

Those

So there is nothing in the way of a fact finding

S

that they took these buildings in order to establish a command

6

post?
A

7

The facts in this case are stipulated, your

8

Honor, on the basis of these formal presentations by the

0

Government and those facts clearly show, that is the Government's

10

own version of the facts show they admit that the buildings were

11

taken as command posts, observation posts and initially "seised

12

to protect the troops»
Q

13

How did the troops get in that position where

14

they needed protection.

IS

were there to protect the buildings, am I right?
A

16

They got in that position because they

X would say that that was one purpose, Mr,

17

Justice Marshall, but the paramount purpose was to protect the

18

Zone, not to protect these particular buildings.

The record doesn't indicate that there were

Molotov cocktails, I believe, on the part of the rioters in the
building at the time the troops first entered and cleared them

Weren’t there fires in the buildings when they

The troops didn’t

start the fires? somebody else started them»

That is correct and they were quickly put out,

8

Q

And can there be any question that a major part

9

of their job as witness of fact that they were lined up in

No, your Honor»

1 am suggesting that where the

Army takes a building, seises it, retires into it
Q

Well, do you see a difference between going and

seizing a building and being driven into a building?
A

I am not so sure that they were driven into the

building but I think that in this case it is the use of the
building that is the crux of the matter,

Am I?

1 am not seizing

I mean speaking only of myself»

Mr. Justice Fortas indicated we could call that

retiring into.

11

Q

12

Q

Yes.
As I understand it your claim is they were there

13

to protect the whole Zone and in protecting the whole Zone they

14

chose this place as the best place to protect the whole Zone,

15

and that they whereby subjected the Government to pay for it

IQ

because for the purposes of compensation zone to equally

17

distribute the costs of warfare or whatever that is among those

18

who

10

A

Yes, Mr. Justice Black, you have stated it.

20

Q

You are not claiming are you that they 'would be

21

22
23
24
25

\

•liable just because of a battle where they injured some property?
A

No.

It is the seizure anduse of these buildings

to protect the entire Eons.
Q

Would it have to be an actual seizure with the

hands or what do you mean by seizure?

44

1

A

Well, as 1 indicated to Mr» Justice Forfcas when

2

we were discussing factual criteria, I think there has to be

3

an actual use, going into the building, establishing a defense

4

fortification, a command post —
Q

3

Wouldn’t that depend on whether the Government

6

took charge of these to make these people the target, x*hat was

7

bound to be a tremendous personal loss of the YMCA for the

8

protection of the Zone»
A

9

Is that your claim?

Yes, your Honor»

That once the Government de­

10

cides that the YMCA and the Masonic Temples buildings are to

11

be sacrificed if they are to be sacrificed for the common good

12

then the public purse must make good and that we can’t and it

13

seems to me that the central issue here is we can’t deny

14

liability on this ground of immediate necessity»

rallied around or gone into the YMCA?

there?

2

A

There were rioters there»

1 am sorry but this

point is unclear,

4

Q

Well 1 mean to say it isn't very reasonable to

5

suppose that if the Army hadn’t come the rioters would have

6

said* "We beg your pardon and backed out of there?'5
A

7
3

The troops cleared out the rioters out of the

YMCA initially.

9

Q

Right, that is the point, isn’t it?

10

A

Yes.

11

And then they took up positions without occupancy

12

in the buildings in front of that,
Q

13

You don’t contend, do you, that whan the troops

14

went there they selected by premeditation these two structures

15

saying these §r® the places where we will defend this whole

16

area.

17

s

Now just let me finish please.
But, isn’t it the fact that on the contrary, as far

13

as this record shows, they made no decision to go into the

ID

buildings, either of them, until they went in under extremist

20

with one soldier having been killed, others having bean wounded

21

and; the rioters were in the buildings and it was under those

22

compulsions that they went into the building,
\

23
24

25

Am I correct on that?
A

Mr, Chief Justice, I frankly cannot tell what

was in the Army's mind when they first entered the Sons,

46

1

Q

Well, no, but have you any right to assume

2

under what is in the record that they did go there with the

3

premeditated intention of using those two places as a rendezvous

4

or as a defense point for that area?
A

5
6

No, your Honor, I can't assume one way or the

other on that»
Q

7

And on the contrary, one soldier was killed right

8

at the entrance to the building before they went in, others

9

were wounded, the rioters were in the building and they went

10

in both for protection of themselves and 1 assume for the

11

protection of the building»

12

Mow is there anything wrong with those facts?

The rioters were in the building initially when the

troops arrived.

I think the sequence is important, Mr» Chief

The troops cleared them out, took positions

They had not taken over the buildings yet at that

point»
Q

What would you expect them to do, go out into

the line of fire and get some more killed?
A

Mo, your Honor, we have no quarrel with the

Army's decision to use these buildings and we have no quarrel
with the Army's decision not to effectively defend them.
Q

Well, I think you do because you claim they were

doing it for a purpose other than to defend the area and defend
47

I

the people in it,
A

2

No, I am sorry if I created that misimpression,

3

Mr, Chief Justice,

4

as Mr, Justice Black indicated for"', the defensa of the entire

5

Eone,

6

I contend that the Array seised, the buildings

It was a prudent decision to withdraw in there.
But our point is when our buildings are seised and

7

used for a governmental purpose the Government as a whole

8

should pay,

9

Q

Were there any others destroyed?

10

Cl

Is there anything in the record to show if the

11
12

Army hadn't shown up they would have been destroyed or blown up?
A

Yes, there is,

13

Q

What is there in the record to substantiate that?

23

between the buildings and the Array were in and the Army was
not when read as a whole,
Am I correct that when the Army arrived the

Q

buildings already burning a little bit?
A

There was a small fire in the YMCA, alone, and

that: was quickly

extinguished and that is no part of the total

loss by the Army,
Q

What would have happened if the Army hadn't put

it out, with the rioters in there?
A

If the Amy hadn't cleared that building?

Q

Yes, if the Army hadn't gone in there as you say
48

1

to defend themselves, what would have happened to that building

2

if they hadn’t gone in there and done that?
A

3

I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice, except that

is

4

not the portion of the YMCA that was destroyed, because it was

5

a brick construction primarily whereas the portion that was

6

destroyed was wooden.

7

would have been necessarily lost.

So it is not clear that the building

Were any other buildings destroyed like that?

Yes, the buildings by the hash marks, the YMCA,

What in a general nature was the damage to this

The YMCA lost a total wing which was in the

nature of an auditorium which was primarily of a wood construetion.

The main building where the initial fire was, Mr. Justice,

was not substantially destroyed.

It was the wing to the YMCA

that \tas lost, and the Masonic Temple it was a second and third
floor fire damage to the interior.

The Masonic Temple was made

of brick and mortar construction so it really didn’t go despite
continued efforts to set it afire.
Q

Was that from Molotov cocktails?

A

Yes.

The record is clear on that, being thrown

in to the second floor over a long period of time.
(Whereupon, at Is55 p.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
