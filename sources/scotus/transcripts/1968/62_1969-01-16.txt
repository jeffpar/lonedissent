No. 62, Thomas R. Kaiser,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SABBATINO;

Mr. Chief Justice and other members

of the Court.
Your Honors, I am going to ask the indulgence of the
Court in this case in one particular matter.
The Petitioners here In forma pauperis and my law firm

12

and myself personally appeared for the petitioners in the Court

13

of Appeals in the State of New York In forma pauperis and also

14

in the appellate division.

15

You will notice that on all the briefs there is the

16

name of Henry J. Boitel as the writer of the briefs.

17

sitting with me here.

18

but has been admitted only less than three years so that he is

19

not a member of this bar.

20

He is

He has been in my office for 3-1/2 years

I ask the indulgence of the court to save some time

21

for rebuttal, for him to handle the rebuttal because he has

22

been with this case from its very inception and in contact with

23

the District Attorney in Nassau County and his assistants.

24
25

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
that purpose.
3

You may be admitted for

i

1

MR. S&BBATINOs

Thank you, your Honor.

2

Your Honor, the Petitioner herein was indicted with

3

two others for attempted extortion, coercion, conspiracy to

4

extort, and several assault and burglary counts.

5

The case was severed.

The other two that were in­

Q

dicted handled their matters their own way.

7

involved in the trial.

3

a sentence of 1-1/2 to 7 years.

9

They weren't

The defendant was convicted and received:

The facts aredeveloped in the brief, but if there are i

10

any particular facts that the Court would want me to refer to

n

or if the Court desires I go into the facts, I shall be glad

12

to do so although they are fully expounded in the briefs.

13

I will say this, your Honor, that the record showed

14

that the conviction of the defendant hinged entirely upon two

15

telephone wiretaps that he had.

16
17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

And a stipulation was entered

into by the District Attorney’s office of Nassau County and ray
office which reads as follows:

And the original of it is filed

with the Clerk of this Court.
"In aid of the Court, the attorneys for the Petitioner
and the attorney for Respondent enter into the following
stipulation concerning the factual background of the Petitioner's
conviction:
"The indictment and conviction of the Petitioner
were completely dependent upon evidence secured by the State of
New York by means of the electronic interception of telephone
4

#*

1

conversations to which the Petitioner was a party.

2

ceptions in question and the use of the evidence obtained

3

thereby were without the authorisation of either party to the

4

said telephone conversations.

5

pursuant to an ex parte order issued by a County Court Judge of

S

the State of New York under the authority of I 813~a of the

7

New York State Code of Criminal Procedure.

8

evidence so obtained, the People of the STate of New York were

9

possessed of nothing which implicated or tended to implicate

10

The inter­

The interceptions were made

Independent of the

the defendant in the crimes charged."

11

Q

Is that in the record?

12

A

Yes, that is part of the record.

13

The original of that stipulation is on file with the

14
15

clerk of the Court.
Now my young assistant who reads all the cases of

1G

this court, and as I say who has written the briefs, all the

17

briefs in this court, I simply shared the expense of the liti­

18

gation with the Government doing my part in Government's, and

19

I have here a list of the various issues which are discussed

20

in the brief and which we submit should induce this court to

21

reverse the conviction and declare the wiretap laws as in

22
23

24
25

violation of constitutional provisions — Federal

Constitution.

We discuss Section 605 of the Federal Communications
Act as being in violation of the right of privacy and is
applicable to the State courts.

Of course, since writing this
5

1

brief this Court has held that Section 605 applies to State

2

Courts„
Then we discuss in the brief Section 605 --

j

ji

the Fourth and Fifth Amendments involving the right of privacy

53

because as I shall point out later in the Lee against Florida

14

case, the Court stated that it passed and reversed there based

15

on the statute and did not reach the constitutional issue.

!
■

J

We* in our brief* raise the constitutional issues.

10

We discussed the Fifth Amendment in the light of what we believe i

57
58
59
20
21

that what was done here can be viewed in the context of com­
pulsory self-incrimination.

I shall discuss that more fully

later on.
Then we discussed the effect of the Ninth Amendment

-

22
23
24
25

as involving in this case the right of privacy also and through
the retainer by the people of .rights not delegated by the -—
under the Federal Constitution to the Federal Government.
We discuss the First Amendment as affecting the

t

6
i

1

serious inhibition that results in speech because of the possi­

2

bility and knowledge that there is wiretapping.

3

Q

Counsel, in the question in this case, doesn't

4

:he question in this case really come down to the warrant?

5

Doesn't it center on the warrant that was --

6

A

Yes.

7

Q

That was obtained and the question, the narrow

0

question in this case, of whether the warrant authorized the

9

search, the wiretapping, so as to immunize it from constitu­

10

tional objection and the bearing of this Court’s decision in

11

Berger on this case.

12

13
14

A

Aren't those the questions?

We discussed that in the brief, your Honor.

I

shall come to that.
Of course, as the whole bar knows, this Court in

15

the Berger case as Justice Fortas just pointed out, Section

16

813a made eavesdropping as expounded in Berger unconstitutional.

17

Then we discussed later on the effect of Berger upon the facts

case under the Fourth Amendment.

Then we discuss the lack of probable cause in the

Then I shall discuss and we discuss in the brief more
fully the general search as lacking in particularity in the
warrant and so on, general search giving the various elements
that this Court held in Berger to make what was done in Berger
unconstitutional and also we discussed the warrants in here as
being too broad and so on under the criteria set forth in
7

»

Berger.

2

a confession point as being somewhat involved in view of the

3

decision, the Miranda decision as affecting what took place at

4

this trial and which disturbed the trial court a great deal but

5

decided against it.

6

And then we also discuss and, of course, consideration,

Q

What do you understand to have been the essence

7

of Judge Keating's holding, writing for the majority in the

Q

Court?
A

9

Well, it is a hard opinion.

It is a peculiar

10

opinion.

Judge Keating in one part held that Qlmstead had not

1!

been reversed by what this Court had done in Berger.

12

Keating said that where a constitutional provision is involved,

13

that the fact that a city is overruled should be more specific.

Judge

[

14

Of course, Justice Douglas in Berger had said that

13

Olmstead had been reversed.

Then after expounding his theory

16

baf. this Court had not overruled Olmstead in the Berger decision,

17

then he went on the theory, let us assume he said, that it does

18

overrule Berger and he expounded a novel theory stating that the

19

Court of Appeals had a right to list what it considered

20

appropriate legal protection for our defendant.

I

21

And we argue and shall argue here as we argue in the

£2

brief that the criteria set down by Judge

23

with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment so that in his

24

efforts to legislate judicially and to try to rehabilitate the

25

statues, his effort is a complete failure.

8

Keating do not comply

1

So on either theory he said whether 01mstead was

2

reversed or whether it wasn’t, he voted to sustain the con­

3

viction .

4

Q

Do you think I am wrong in suggesting that this

5

opinion comes down to two holdings, one is that Berger did not

6

cover wiretapping? to distinguish from --

7

A

That is right.

8

Q

Bugging, and No. 2, if it does, why Berger ought

9

not to be made retroactive.

10

Isn't that the essence of what he does?

11

A

Well, I don't think the decision goes that far

12

although in Judge Fuld’§ dissenting opinion he pointed out that

13

the Court in the Grossman case, in the Court of Appeals, the

14

Court had given retroactive effect to Berger and then since

15

apparently the Court did not want to give retroactive activity

16

effect to this case in a footnote the Court overruled its

17

opinion in Grossman.

18

And Judge Fuld covers these interesting points in his

19

dissenting opinion.

20

lawyer I believe that Judge Fuld's opinion is a reasonable

21

opinion and he points out that that is not equal justice where

22

the Appellate Division or the Court of Appeals gives effect of

23

retroactivity for one person and then denies it to Kaiser when

24

he comes up there.

25

Of course, it suits my purpose but as a

So, Judge Keating's opinion as far as I am concerned
9

1

from my limited experience in the Federal bar and this Courtf

2

Judge Keating's opinion determined nothing as far as this

3

Court is concerned»

4

Section 1813a is still unconstitutional because the

5

provisions which were found inadequate to protect a person

6

under the Fourth Amendment, the provisions of 1813a were

7

insufficient, did not comply with what this court held for the
j

{

8

requirements of the Fourth Amendment.
And practically the entire statute, 1813a, applies

9
10

to both bugging and wiretapping, the fact that there is no

11

distinction between the two.

12

and we say the Court was right in declaring 1813a void, un-

13

constitutional, on its face, the same thing applies to the

14

Kaiser case and the wiretapping situation.

J
So that if this Court was right

As Judge Fuld said, the Court could not write a new

IS
IS

statute.

That is the function of the Court of Appeals.

And

17

even in the so-called inadequate new statute that the court

18

judicially wrote, there would be no compliance even under those

19

requirements with what this Court had held in the Berger case

20

as protecting a defendant under the requirements of the Fourth

21

Amendment.

22

But I am going ahead of my notes here.

23

Well, I refer to Lee against Florida where an in­

as

criminating conversation was tapped.

25

Court reversed it and held that wiretapping and the use of the
10

Lee was convicted.

This

1

conversations obtained through wiretapping in violation of 605

2

was in violation of law and reversed.

3

If my memory serves me right, this Court used the

4

language that you did not reach the constitutional issues and

5

reversed merely because a statute of Congress was violated.

6

We argue, your Honors, that Section605 which gave the

7

defendant certain rights which were violated in his case because

S

there wasn't any consent of either party, that right was a right

9

he had which was entitled to protection under the Fourth

10
11

Amendment and perhaps even under the Fifth Amendment.
In other words, once he had that right, this Court

12

should give the defendant, the Petitioner Kaiser, the benefit

13

of the protection of the Fourth Amendment.

14

illegal search and seizure.

15

to do, reverses on the combined effect of the Fourth Amendment

16

and perhaps the Fifth Amendment which I shall touch upon in a

17

few minutes, if it reverses not only because 605 was violated

18

but because his constitutional rights were invaded by virtue

19

of the Fourth Amendment, then we have reached a constitutional

20

argument and this case is one of first impression in this Court

21

It was here an

And if this Court, as we urge you

and the defendant should get the benefit of that, of what

22

follows from that, and not be penalized after having reached

23

this case if the Court adopts our point of view.

24
25

I appreciate that when it comes to interpreting
constitutional provisions, lawyers disagree just as judges of
11

flii

this Court in opinion after opinion have disagreed.,

o

attorneys for this petitioner we feel that this Court should

3

hold and extend other decisions it has written, the legal

4

doctrine based on the Fifth Amendment and other holdings that

5

the seizure of telephone conversations was in a broad sense

6

compulsory self-incrimination.

7

category.

But as

And it comes under that

}

Now in Rochin against California this Court held that I

8
9

i
pumping a stomach was a form of compulsory self-incrimination

10

and reversed»

In Townsend against Sain this Court held that

11

injecting a truth serurn was a form of compulsory incrimination

12

and reversed.

13

In |»esire against the United States, an informer :
I1
with a bug obtained information after indictment in a car.

14

And this Court held that that was a form of compulsory self-

IS

incrimination.

j

I shall refer to it more fully a little later, but

16
17

in a sense the warnings of Miranda I think should help us out

18

because during the District Attorney's summation in this

19

particular case he said that the Petitioner had made unqualified

20

confessions.
This was in summation.

21

22
23

Miranda had just been handed

down.
After the summation, in chambers, the trial attorney,

24

Mr. Bouse, had extended argument with the Court and the Court

25

was disturbed and stated that in his opinion they were not
12
i

1

confessions, they were only statements.

2

fact of the importance that this Court gave in Miranda to what

3

was being done by the police and others in connection with

4

confessions, in the jury's mind, the jury must have felt since

S

the prosecutor vigorously repeatedly in summation called those

6

statements confessions adversely affected the rights of the

7

defendant.

And in view of the

0

And I think that by a parity of reasoning what was

done there in summation was just as harmful as what was done

10

in Rochin against California, Townsend against Sain, Lesire (?)

against the United States, and so on.

and so on,

8
9

i
I want to say something about the First Amendment,
your Honor.

I think other writers on the subject, your Honor,

10

have referred to the fact that the very existence and knowledge

11

that there is wiretapping has an inhibiting effect on speech

12

and it has an inhibiting effect not only of those that may be

13

criminals but it has an inhibiting effect on all segments of

14

the population.

j

fi

I

|

IS

That is bad for a free society.

That is one of the

16

evils of wiretapping.

17

another solution to the so-called organized crime without

18

destroying essentially the basic structure of our society.

19

That is why the Government must find

I don’t think our Government is going to plead guilty j

20

and permit the building of an autocratic society where the

21

privacy in an American home will be destroyed through the

22
23
24
25

extensive wiretapping that takes place, especially where you
have the difficulty where the tapping is indiscriminate and the
person cannot limit their tapping to what he believes may be
evil because it seizes conversations of all others.
14

1

2

It is impossible.

We haven't yet reached the stage

inhere our Government should run the risk of building an

3

autocracy.

We can still destroy crime whether organised or

4

disorganized through other means.
As I say, the 1813a is dead through the holding of

5
8

this Court in Berger and it is dead in the Kaiser case.

7

dealt with bugging and Katz removed the necessity for trespass.

8

Katz specifically, and Olmstead, and we believe Kaiser is the

9

first wiretap case raising the constitutional issues which we

10

Berger

raise.
Now, I haven't got time to answer fully the question

11
12

that Judge Fortas raised about probable cause and so on although

13

we discuss them fully in the brief and discuss how a warrant

14

was a general search, general search, general search, no return

1S

provided, and so on.

case.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

19

Mr. Cahn.

20

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM CAHN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

21

22
23
24
25

Very well.

MR. CAHN:

Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court pleases.

Although it is the contention of the people that the
Fourth Amendment should not apply to the interception of
telephonic communications, may I in light of Mr. Justice Fortas'
15

1

question and the possibility that this illustrious court will

z

so hold,, talk about first the retroactive effect of holding

3

that the Fourth Amendment should apply.

4

It is our contention, of course, that retroactivity

5

should not be afforded in this particular case.

6

other wiretapping cases

Here, as in

7

Q

Retroactivity of what?

8

A

The Fourth Amendment provisions enunciated in

9

the Katz and Berger cases, Mr. Justice White.
Q

Did these taps occur before Berger and before

'12

A

Well over a year before Berger.

13

Q

Was the trial before Berger?

14

A

Well, the trial ended a year before Berger.

13

Q

Let us see.

16

A

In the Katz case, I believe.

17

Q

And I guess it was Olmstead that was an explicit

10
11

18

Katz?

We overruled Olmstead as of when?

holding that the Fourth Amendment did not require?

19

A

That is correct.

20

Q

Are you saying that the overruling of Olmstead

21

should not be made retroactive?

Is that what you said?

22

A

No.

23

Q

That is what I can't quite understand.

24

A

I am saying that the application of Katz and

25

Berger holding

that — which seems to indicate that the
16

1

Fourth Amendment would apply to wiretapping should not be made

2

retroactive.

3

In this particular case law enforcement justifiably

4

and in good faith relied on court decisions and court precedent

5

which indicated at that particular time that wiretapping was

6

not controlled by provisions of the Fourth Amendment.

7

Q

When did

this wiretap take place?

8

A

In 1964,

your Honor.

9

Q

When wasthe trial?

10

A

In 1966.

11

Q

15

year before the Berger case,, we almost presumed Berger.

16

17
18

In

involved in this particular matter, we requested a court order.
The request consisted of not only an affidavit but page upon

19

page of sworn testimony before a judge of a court of record in

20

our county.

21

22
23
24
25

It was on the basis of this testimony and the affi­
davit that the order permitting the office of District Attorney
to intercept these telephonic communications was given.
In other words, as Mr. Justice Keating stated, we
used the procedure of antecedent justification before a
17

1

magistrate which is the central theme of the Fourth Amendment.

2

This is one reason why 1 believe that retroactivity should not

3

be afforded.

4

Further, as it was stated in the Fuller case, the

5

objective of deferrence would not be served by a retroactive

S

adjudication nor remedy a defect in the fact-finding process.

?
8

Q

Well, if you prevail on this point, is that the

end of this case?

9

A

I would say yes, your Honor.

10

Q

Do you really have to depend on retroactivity?

11

Let us suppose that New York did not have a statute.

12

suppose that when we ruled in Berger that the New York statute

13

as drafted was unconstitutional, that that was wiped out.

14

Suppose New York didnot have a special statute and suppose that j

15

as in this case an officer, here 1 think it was the Assistant

16

District Attorney, went before a magistrate or a judge and made

17

a showing which was elaborate and lengthy here as the record

18

shows and pursuant to that he obtained a proper search warrant

19

although here there is an issue as to whether the warrant was

20

properly limited and required a return and so on.

21

Let us

But suppose he obtained the proper search warrant.

22

Do you read Berger or any decision of this Court as saying

23

that wiretap pursuant to a warrant would be constitutionally

24

prohibited unless it is done pursuant to a state statute?

25

A

No, I do not, your Honor.
18

It is our contention,

!

1

No* 1, that the Fourth Amendment shouldn't apply -—
Q

2
3

No, no, no.

The Fourth Amendment does apply in

this assumption on assumption that is involved in my question.

4

A

Oh, I see.

5

Q

But assume that the wiretapping would be un­

6

lawful unless the requirements of the Fourth Amendment were

7

satisfied and assume there were not statutes and assume that

8

the assistant, that a proper officer of the state made a proper

9

showing and obtained a proper warrant that would satisfy the

10

warrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment.
Now I suppose you would argue that you are home free

21

and there is no constitutional objection to that and that would
not involve the question of whether Berger is or is not retro­
active .
A

That is correct.

Speaking of home free, I don't believe we can solely
rely on that.

May I for a few moments speak about the appli­

cation of Section 605, which I believe was fully disposed of
insofar as the case of Lee against Florida is concerned.
But because of the importance of this particular
matter, may I ask the Court to reconsider the retroactive pro­
visions mentioned in Fuller against Alaska.
Here again, insofar as 605 is concerned, the people
acted in good faith relying on Schwartz, and at that particular
time Section 813 of the New York State Statutes.

And here

the order permitting us to intercept the telephonic communi™

of Section 605«

We relied on 34 years of experience at that particular

of Fuller.

of the case of Hamm versus Rock Hill which in my opinion and

You have already said that Lee and

A

Correct, sir.

Q

Well, what are you asking us to do, to reconsider

A

I am asking that insofar as what was stated

for?

15

IS

Excuse me.

Florida was not retroactive?

12

34

What I am asking this Court to consider now in view

Q

30
'31

f

in Fuller that the doctrine enunciated in Stovall be applied
to retroactivity rather than the time of trial which may have
been prevented by defense maneuvering,

by motions made by the

l
l

defendant, by the impossibility at the time of getting a
!

20

defendant into the jurisdiction.
Q

applied?

What was the theory of post activity that we

It was not the Stovall theory?
A

\

I believe it was the Johnson theory, your Honor,
y

where you applied at the time of trial rather than at the time
of the wiretap which insofar as my own particular county is

25
20

I
I

1

concerned is vital to us because we have a number of cases where

2

wiretapping was used long before Berger and if we are thwarted

3

by the Doctrine of Johnson rather than the Doctrine of Stovall, !

4 these cases I believe will fall by the wayside.
5

And I believe that under the circumstances —--

6

Q

I don't understand.

Didn't we say — you quote

7

in your brief — maybe i had better get it — perspective

a

application of Lee supported by all the consideration as out­

9

lined in Stovall.

10

And yet you say we didn't apply the Stovall

Doctrine?

11

A

12

From my reading -- may I read further here?

13

active application of Lee would overturn every state conviction

14

obtained in good faith, reliance on Schwartz.

15

result is not required by the principle upon which Lee was

16

decided or necessary to accomplish its purpose, we hold that

17

the exclusionary rule is to be applied only to trials in which

18

the evidence is sought to be introduced after the date of our

19

decision in Lee.

20
21

22

That is correct, sir.
Retro­

Since this

This to me seems to indicate application of the
Johnson theory rather than Stovall.
Q

Well that is a little less retroactive even

23

than Johnson because it says to trials in which the evidence

24

is sought to be introduced after the date of Lee.

25

might have begun before the date of Lee.
21

The trial

1

A

That is correct, sir«

2

Q

It is your position that if the wiretap is made

3

two years ago it can be used tomorrow in the trial?
I

4

A

Yes, sir.

I think we have relied on precedent

and decisions enunciated by this Court here before»

S
6

Q

You still think you can use it?

7

A

I still would like to use it, your Honor»

i

I

8

think that where the law enforcement agency relied on the

enunciations of this Court in good faith, that this evidence

don't now have a perfect right to use it.

18

points, aren't they?

21

A

They are two different

The right to tap without the right to use is

meaningless, your Honor.

The evidence that was obtained as was

enunciated so eloquently by my colleague, we thoroughly agree

of our interception of this telephonic communication, Kaiser

13

All I am asking is

Now, if we had the right to tap that conversation
22

1

but did not have the right to use it in Court, we feel that a

2

man who had been convicted of a very serious crime would have

3

4

in good faith on the decisions of this Court heretofor.

And we obtained the information as a result of relying

Could you have convicted him without the actual

conversations being used?

7

A

No, sir.

8

Q

And there weren't any punks that you could have

10

A

No, sir.

11

These conversations were very explicit.

12

Q

9

13

These conversations -—

used?

Tell me, Mr. Cahn, if you prevail on the first

one on the retroactivity on Berber *--

14

A

15

But I hesitate to leave an avenue open.

16

Then we don't reach the 605.

I agree.
And it was

mentioned by my colleague -Q

17

Well, now why don't we?

Because I gather if we

18

hold that Berger and Katz are not retroactive that only goes

19

to the First, the Fourth Amendment question, doesn't it?
How does it reach the 605 question that

20
21

22

prohibits

use?
I believe that the Fuller case involves 605, but that

23

is not my question.

Even if you have prevailed that Katz and

24

Berger are not retroactive and therefore that these taps were

25

perfectly constitutional under Olmstead at the time they were
23

1

made?

a

A

Yes.

3

Q

You still £a^e the difficulty under 605 of

4

prohibition.

That is prohibition against use.

5

Is that right?

6

A

Yes.

7

Q

For that then to prevail we have got to modify

8

our holding in Fuller* is that it?
A

0

No.

I am asking that this Court modify the

10

holding in fuller but holding Fuller would be sufficient to

n

have this case sustained because --

12

Q

13

Oh, because the trial was before Lee in Florida?

14

A

Yes, that is correct, sir.

15

Q

Well, then why are you asking us to modify

16

Fuller then?

What do you mean by holding?

Because of some other cases?

17

A

Because of public interest.

18

Q

Of some other cases?

19

A

Absolutely.

20

Q

Oh, heavens, don't we

have enough to do to

21

decide here without deciding all the rest of your cases for

22

you?

23

A

24

Q

25

In this particular decision and in reference -j

No, but seriously, Mr. Cahn, if you can prevail

under Fuller, if you prevail on the Fourth Amendment point, I
24

1

honestly don’t see why you should ask us now to review again

2

what we held before.

3

A

For the simple reason that I am offering to

4

this Court an argument which I don’t think was placed before

5

the Court in Fuller and that is the doctrine enunciated in Hamm

6

versus Rock Hill where the Court stated that the passing of the

7

Civil Rights Law abated a state statute even though there was

8

a conviction, even though there was an appeal.

And I am asking that since the passing of our Safe

9
10

Streets Act which was passed a matter of days after Lee -Q

11
12

It abated.

605,

where there isn't any Fourth Amendment point?
A

13

You are just saying that 605, there isn't any

That is correct.

There is no 605 because of the

14

doctrine enunciated in Hamm versus Rock Hill.

13

don’t think that --

And again I

16

Q

We don't have to reach that in this case?

17

A

Pardon?

18

Q

We certainly don't have to reach that in this

19

case.

20

next year or in the spring?

21

That is some other case you are going to bring up here

A

If it is not reached in these cases, those cases

22

where wiretaps were used in cases involving organized crime,

23

where court orders were obtained, and where delays --

24
25

Q

You mean they won't be tried?

A

That is correct, sir.
25

1

Q

Well, they will be if you have any confidence

2

in the argument you are just making to us on the Hamm versus

3

Rock Hill.

4

A

But if the doctrine enunciated in the Fuller

S

case is strictly adhered to by the lower court, I can't see how

6

a judge can reach any other decision but to dismiss the case.

It would be an acquittal or something like that

that you can't appeal from?

There are cases in my

Can't you appeal in your state on a motion to

suppress or sustain, can't you appeal?
A

Where there is no other possibility of conviction,

14

yes, we can appeal but this isn’t the question that would per­

15

mit the state to go to the Federal Courts to appear before this

16

illustrious Court because cur own Court of Appeals would be

A

You could bring the question here.

Mr. Justice White, may I say that if this

Court’s ruling in Fuller is applied, they have clearly stated
in my opinion that we will not make

Lee against Florida

Yes, but Fuller didn't consider whether the
26

2

A

I see why Mr. Justice White is suggesting that

we bring the Rock Hill argument before the lower court and

Why not?

Not overrule.

Because of the fact that I offered for this

Court’s consideration an argument and a precedent which I

16

believe did not come before the Court in the Fuller case and

that is the doctrine enunciated in the Rock Hill case.

asking that in a case where this court decided that the Stovall

doctrine be enunciated.

t

I am

.

Apparently one of the Justices, I can’t remember

20

I
j

21

which one, was confused as to what doctrine applied in Fuller.

22

But 1 think it apparent that the Johnson doctrine applies

23

which limits retroactivity to cases which have already been

24

tried.

25

And those cases are waiting trial, perhaps awaiting

the very decision of this court are going to be affected.
28

Tell me, Mr. Cahn, was 605 expressly repealed

in the Safe Streets Act?

is hereby repealed?

Therefore, it was our contention *—-

3

Q

I am informed, yes, that it did.

it is no longer in force, having been repealed in June of '68

10

by an Act in Congress.

11

A

12

me that the Safe Streets Act expressly repealed Section 605

May I proceed further now?

21

You were saying that Berger should not be

Lee against Florida, something drastic will happen to that.
Is that correct?
A

Apparently Mr. Levine who wrote the brief informs

Well, the terminology of drastic or not, Mr.

Justice Fortas, is beyond me.

I don't see it as a drastic

change.
Q

To win your case, you have got to prevail on the

first two points or one of the first two points?
A

On retroactive, I believe insofar as the Fourth

Amendment and 605 is concerned, yes.

You can just rely on Fuller against Alaska to

win as far as 605 is concerned.

Maybe I was presumptuous

6

to bring the Rock Hill argument before the court in this

particular case for which I apologize.

8

important enough to bring it to the attention of this court

9

because I don't think it was brought before the court in the

But I thought it

to

Fuller case nor was the Stovall argument brought before the

n

court in this particular case.

12

1 think it was Justice Brennan who thought that

13

Stovall did apply.

There is a big difference.

There is quite

U

a difference, and an important difference insofar as my own

15

particular county is concerned and that is why I presume to

1G

bring the argument before the court and I sincerely apologize.

17

I hesitate in view of what Mr. Justice Fortas stated

IS

to argue the application of the Fourth Amendment to wiretapping.

19

There are those who believe that it was not clearly enunciated

20

in Berger and Katz.

21

I am one of the minority.

Berger and Katz were eavesdropping cases.

I think

22

this is the first time in this particular era that wiretapping,

23

the interception of telephonic communications comes forth

24

square before the court.

25

I just would like to take a few moments to express

30

1

the fact that if the personal theory were extremely — were

2

interpretated to its extreme, law enforcement would be placed

3

in a position of terrible uncertainty,,

4

The policeman who stands behind a bush to observe two

5

people who seek the corner of a park believing themselves to be

6

free and in complete privacy would not know whether he was to

7

first run to get a court order, shadowing, the use of binoculars

8

the turning on of a flashlight in a dark place, the overhearing

9

of conversations in a corner of a room would all be placed in

10

an area of uncertainty which I believe places an undue burden

11

on law enforcement.

12

One might ask if I do not accept the personal theory

3

— and mind you as a law enforcement officer I must obey the

14

law as it is written and as it is interpreted by the courts.

15

Although the personal privacy theory which was ex­

16

pounded in Katz is accepted by the court, I suggest that there

17

should be some touching, some connection, that the wiretapping,

18

the personal privacy theory should not be extended therefore

19

to wiretapping where there is no touching, where there is no

20

nntect whatsoever.

21

When there is no contact with a specific place --

22

Q

23
24
25

Well, this is really arguing that we ought to

overrule Lee against Florida?
A

No, sir, because again these particular cases

did not involve wiretapping.

They involved eavesdropping.
31

t

Q

Lee involves the equivalent of wiretapping,

o
£*

A

Lee did not involve a tap; it involved an

3

extension of a telephone.

4

Q

The equivalent of wiretapping.

5

A

If the court so believes, I don't think that that

6

applies.

7

personal privacy theory would place on law enforcement and

8

because of the undue harm in my opinion which it would cause

9

as a result of placing law enforcement in such a position, I

10
11

12
13
14

15

But in any event, because of the position which the

believe that idle Fourth Amendment should not be applied to the
interception of telephonic communications and as a result of
the arguments heretofore mentioned, I think that people against
Kaiser should be sustained.
Thank you.

22
23
2-4
25

Mr, Boitel.

MR. BOITEL;

May it please the Court.

Toward the beginning of Mr. Sabbatino's argument,
Mr. Justice Fortas asked whether there x-fas just a simple narrow
issue in this case.
narrov? issue.

The fact is that there is not a simple

There are no less than 12 separate, distinct

reasons why the Petitioner's conviction must be reversed.
Eleven of those reasons have to do with statutory and
constitutional prohibitions concerning wiretapping directly.

32

1

The twelfth has to do with the characterization of those wire­

2

taps before a jury repeatedly and intentionally as absolute

3

unqualified confessions.
Also, I believe it was Justice Fortas who asked about

4
5

the effect of the unconstitutionality of Section 813a.

6

Berger, Mr. Justice Clark specifically held in his opinion he

7

specifically stated that the statute being unconstitutional on

8

its face, we need not look into the order, the probable cause

9

or any of the other requirements, that the petition of Berger’s

19

In

conviction had to be reversed.
Now, the wiretapping aspects of the statute are

11

12

exactly the same as the bugging aspects of the statute.

13

follow Mr. Justice Clark's rationale in the present case would

14

definitely require the reversal of the petitioner's conviction.
There are two retroactivity aspects to this case.

15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

To

The first aspect is the 605 retroactivity argument.

Granted, if

Fuller against Alaska is to be applied strictly to the
Petitioner Kaiser, then the 605 argument is not available to
him.
But we suggest to this court that at least as to the
Petitioner Kaiser, Fuller was inappropriately decided.
In the first place, the Petitioner Kaiser was before
this court at the same time that Fuller was before this court.
In fact, certiorari had been granted in Kaiser’s case before
certiorari had been granted in Fuller's case.
33

The judge in his opinion on

2

ihat motion indicated his dissatisfaction with the due process

3

requirements involved in wiretapping.
The trial judge in the present case indicated that he

4
5

thought the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were violated by wire­

6

tapping but he felt himself bound by the decisions of higher

7

courts.

8
9
10

11

For those reasons, we would specifically, we would
respectfully urge that Fuller be overruled at least as far as
the Petitioner Kaiser is concerned.
On the question of the retroactivity of Berger and

12

Katz and that series of cases, in the first place, this court

13

has not specifically passed on the question of wiretapping.

14

through this case this court holds wiretapping to be uncon­

20
21

22
23
24
25

If

stitutional it will be a case of first impression.
Secondly, this court in applying the Berger and Katz
rationales to this case would in effect be applying Mapp because
Mapp is the case that determines what the exclusionary rule is
concerning search and seizure.
All of the events in this case occurred after the
decision in Mapp.
Q

(Inaudible.)

A holding that wiretapping, too,

might comply with Fourth Amendment requirements?
A

Actually there is no doubt in my mind that

Berger and Katz in effect apply to wiretapping.
35

Katz itself

1

was a case that involved a telephone booth.

The analogy to go

2

into a telephone booth and closing the door, et cetera, I don't

3

see how logically one can distinguish wiretapping from bugging.

4

However, the fact is that this court has not specifi-

5

cally passed on the question of wiretapping and we have

6

Mr. Cahn's office here very strongly urging this court that

7

wiretapping is not unconstitutional so, of course, we must

8

make that argument.

9
10
11
