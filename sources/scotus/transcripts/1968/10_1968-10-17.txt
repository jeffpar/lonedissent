ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. Z4ARSH

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

6

MR. MARSH:

This is an appeal from the Supreme Court

7

of New Jersey and presents a single clear issue of constitu­

a

municipality to tax certain property to be used within New

to

where this court said xdiere a division of corporations into

This Court has said many times that

1

The difficulty with the New Jersey Supreme Court's

decision when faced with a statute unconstitutional on its face

is that they simply said that the legislature had some basis fox

it or could have had some basis for it and that there could be

3

some reason for not taxing domestic corporations but taxing

6

foreign corporations.
This Court long ago invalidated this approach in the

9

said that to so treat the due process and equal protection

11

clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment would make them into a
"mere rope of sand" affording no protection from state action.

In addition to the facts that are set forth by the

applied for an exemption under the statute 54:4-4.4.

they didn't have to handle that.

and therefore they didn't consider this point.

taxes now.

23

and I might say the same question was raised by the New Jersey

24

Supreme Court, whether this was an act to clarify the existing

25

law or was it a modification to carry on after January 1.

It is true we are only arguing back

The new act that became effective January 1, 1968,

-

12-

j

I might only add that the law firm that was handling

'i

£

the matter in the state level was from a law firm where a

3

senator sponsored the bill»

4

it was not declaratory act? but an act to amend 5443.6 and to

5

carry on after the first of January.

So, I think it is safe to say that

6

Q

What does the new act do precisely?

7

A

The new act simply says that non-profit corporations

8

whether they be domestic or foreign are exempt under the new

9

citation which is 3.SA, or something like that.

It just

10

includes that in there , domestic or foreign corporations are

11

included in the exemption of this section.

12

The taxes, as I said, amount to approximately $60,000.

13

I would like to address myself to the procedure point

14

here, that the fact that the Federal issue was never raised in

15

this matter until at the Supreme Court of New Jersey and it migh

16

17

18
19
20
21

22

not have been raised then had it not been for the fact that the
appellate division of the Superior Court was unanimous in
upholding the statute as it was argued because it was argued
by Channel 12 that they are organized under the laws of New
Jersey because they qualified or because they had a registered
act in the state that could be served with a service of process.
So therefore they were "Organized."

The word

23

organized as shown in the opinions of the Superior Court,

24

appellate division, and the State Supreme Court of New Jersey,

25

meant that it dealt with organisations such as religious
-13-

1

organisations that are not incorporat’d but nevertheless are

z

organised in New Jersey and are available for the exemption.

3

This is the argument that prevailed to the Supreme

4

Court.

5

problem of how to get into the Supreme Court because there was

6

dissent in the appellate division and no constitutional issue

7

raised.

Then, the appellate in this matter was faced with the

8

It then for the first time raised the issue of the

9

equal protection of the lawn under the 14th amendment of the

10

Federal Constitution.

11

Q

Was that on a certificate?

12

A

I believe it was on a direct appeal but for the first

S3

time raised a Federal issue at which time the attorney general

14

did contact me and suggested at which I was doing at the time

15

that I entered a motion to dismiss for failure to raise any

16

federal issue or any constitutional issue up to that point since

17

it was no dissent in the appellate division.

18

There was no ground for an appeal to the New Jersey Supreme

19

Court.

20

problem simply stated as is outlined on page 9 of the appendix

21

"This Court may, but need not accept a constitutional question

22

not raised below.

23

The New Jersey Supreme Court when faced with this

As this constitutional contention is one of great

24

concern to many municipalticis and nGn-pro££.>- foreign corporations,

Whatever it was.

They have decided that this statute is unconstitutiona

9

They have decided it?

under the constitutional attact first raised there.

Of course,

10

it is my understanding that: this court, demand that when a

11

constitutional issue is to be raised that it be raised at the

12

lowest level and not to be raised as an afterthought and

13

perhaps the last court in the state as set forth in the

14

appendix.

The question was never raised.
It was just, the statutory construction whether they

15
16

were organized and came under that exemption.

17

lost all of those arguments, through the state court.

18
19

Q

Of course, they

Suppose the law provided that it could not be raised

and it had to be raised with the Supreme Court?

constitutional argument in the highest court in New Jersey.

7

Q

They dieided?

8

A

They decided that as one of the points raised.

9

Q

We have said that the constitutional question must be

raised in the lowest court where it became pertinent or haven’t
we merely said that it is an adequate state ground for not

1 think the latter part of your statement is correct,

that this court has held it that way.
As was stated, Channel 12 is now exempt from this
time on from '68 on and we are only arguing about back taxes.
Now, of course, the Borough of Glassboro now finds itself in a
position where it is arguing for these back taxes:that their
local citizens have paid which they apparently will not be
able to retrieve if now this contract were to decide that this
statute that was effective up to 1968 is in fact unconstitutional..
This court has upheld in cases where a foreign corpora­
tion need not be given equal treatment with domestic corporations
The thrust of Glassboro's argument in this matter is
-

16-

1

that these eases deal with profit corporations that are involved

2

in interstate commerce, and the reasoning behind these is that

3

they should not. discriminate against foreign corporations

4

because at the Federal level we look at the nation as a whole

5

and we don't divide it into boundary lilies and there shouldn't

6

be adverse discrimination between these corporations.
However, in this situation, 1 think the focus is

7

8

directed wrong.

3

We are allowing a complete exemption from any taxes.

S
12

Here the Estate of New Jersey is giving a gift.
t appears

to me that the State of New Jersey should be able to decide who
whey are going to give this; gift to.

These people pay no taxes

whatsoever or they are demanding that they pay no taxes whatever
They don't want to pay any for any local municipal

services at all.

They want, to be completely free from all

taxes.

16

if you follow some simple procedures.

New Jersey says that we will grant these exemptions

f7

No. 1, that you be non-profit, they are.

18

No. 2, of course that you own property which they do

19

and No. 3, that you be organized or incorporated in the State of

20

New Jersey.

21

Q

What is the reascn for the last one?

22

A

Your Honor, the New Jersey Supreme Court handled that

23

problem previously.

don't say that the statements they made

24

is the end of the reasons that might be put forth on why you

25

should be incorporated in New Jersey.

1

For instance, of course, we are trying to figure out

2

what the legislature had in mind some 25 years ago when they

3

enacted this legislation.

4

assets from the contributions of the public,many of which are

We are in a dilemma here.

I am only trying to

To be quite frank with you, it is

I think the New Jersey Supreme Court had a little

6

bit. of trouble when they mentioned the point about perhaps the

7

local assessor should not be burdened with the problem of trying

8

to figure out what a foreign jurisdiction considers as non­

9

profit.

10

Of course, it is not applicable in this case because

11

we agree that there is no question that WHYY is non-profit.

12

I feel this is a suggestion put forth by the New Jersey Supreme

13

Court.

14

Q

It is not the end reasoning of the New Jersey Legislature.
Do I understand you to say that unless there is or

15

unless we can really think up some substantial reason, to justif

16

the statute, that the statute is bad?

17

A

I feel on the surface of it it appears that it does

18

discriminate against a foreign corporation as compared to a

19

local corporation basically on the ground that they didn't

20

incorporate in the state of New Jersey.

21

Q

Is this organization entitled to equal protection?

22

I haven't raised that point.

I think they are.

I

23

don't think there is any question that the -- if you are

24

alluding to the problem of whether corporations are allowed to

25

raise the equal protection clause as not being a person, I

didn't think that was of much moment to raise that point a1though

provide the exemption.

4

A

He did.

I thought he conceded that.

I think the Chief Justice’s question was

5

what was the background of this, whether it was a clarification,

6

or repeal and I think Mr. Marsh said he would like to think of

7

it as a clarification rather them an appeal of it.

8

9
10
11

It is my position, of course, that it was an appeal
of it specifically for the act which is for educational
corporations either domestic or foreign.
The main case that I am faced with, of course, is the

12

case in the Glander case which this court has ruled on and has

13

upheld in previous cases on discrimination against foreign

14

corporations which has concern with the domestic corporations.

15

The Glander case, as I have said before, the focus

IS

is on profit corporations that are in the business for a

17

profit but the firm in the Ohio corporation there —— the foreign

18

corporation in Ohio, was paying all of its proper taxes, its

19

personal property taxes, its franchise taxes and then they

20

were attempting to tax the accounts receivable in that matter,

21

a discrimination of the foreign corporation as compared to the

22

domestic corporation.

23

The problem we are faced with here is an outward

grant by the State of New Jersey, a gift.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. TRIMBLE

2

MR. TRIMBLE:

A case was alluded to in the appellant's

3

brief.

4

which is the only case involved in the appellant's brief with

S

non-profit corporations, is a situation where a state did

6

discriminate on a taxing basis for a non-profit corporation and

7

it was upheld.

8

The Board of Education of Kentucky versus Illinois case,

The basis was that this money was going to be or had

9

to be used exclusively in the State of Kentucky and therefore

10

Illinois would not receive any benefits from it and therefore

11

could tax it, or it was an inheritance tax in that matter.

12

It can be differentaited in the fact that WHYY is

13

claiming that they do benefit the State of New Jersey or

14

Southern New Jersey with their transmitter.

15

The problem of rebutting the volume news information

16

that was supplied was that this information was supplied just

17

prior to arguing before the New Jersey Supreme Court.

18

question apparently came up in their mind, what benefits does

19

New Jersey receive from your Channel 12 and this was supplied

20

as is outlined in their appendix.

21

This

However, I don’t think an extension of that rule of

22

the Illinois case could be applicable here and that the

23

discrimination that New Jersey is attempting or alleged

24

discrimination is not that far that it would be unfair to the

23

local residents of Glassboro, that that rule could be extended

24

to this situation, that they should incorporate in the State

2

of New Jersey so that Glassboro wouldn’t tax them and be found

This was upheld.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. MARSH

12

MR. MARSH:

Just to clarify, first, Mr. Justice

13

Brennan’s problems about the attorney general, I think it may

14

be explained by the reason of the fact that during this

15

litigation and up to today the Attorney General of New Jersey

16

is a member of the Board of WHYY, which might have made his

17

participation a little awkward.
The other problem about the statute, the statute we

18
19

have talked about was passed after the decision of the Superior

20

Court of New Jersey, but before the decision of the Supreme

21

Court of New Jersey.
So, I suppose you would say it was a repeal of the

22
23

decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, but it had no

24

bearing ---

25

Q

I thought you said that the new statute has no
-

25-

1

retroactive application?

2

A

No, it doesn't.

But as far as the passage and its

3

relation to the Supreme Court decision, it intervened between

4

the Superior Court's decision and the Supreme Court decisions.

5

As far as the statement that we should have been

6

required to incorporate in New Jersey, the New Jersey legisla­

7

ture took care of that by not making any such provision.

8

have complied with all the laws and regulations they did put

9

down.

JO

We

We feel we have fully qualified for all the rights and

privileges that a non-profit corporation has in New Jersey.
This is also a distinction between the Kentucky case

11
12

which I put in my brief because in that case you had a question

13

of the Kentucky corporation which hadn't qualified in Illinois,

14

couldn't give any benefits to the people of Illinois and

15

Illinois said rightly that they didn't have to give them this

16

inheritance tax.

17

I think it is a quite different case.

18

The only other question I wanted to touch on was the

19

question of the exemption.

20

these exemptions is not in this exemption section.
Secondly, it is placed on the assessor not on the

21

22
23
24
25

The requirement that you apply for

taxpayer.
Thirdly, there was substantial compliance in that we
did make a request on November 7, 1963 as opposed to November 1.
The final thing, probably the most significant thing,
-

26

-

1

is the Supreme Court of New Jersey did not decide the case on

£

that ground»

3

they would have because they could have avoided deciding a

4

Federal constitutional issue by simply telling us what your

S

rights are, you gave them up»

3

Had they thought much of it, it seems to me

I submit we have complied with all the laws of

7

New Jersey and under the decisions of this Court are

8

entitled to the same treatment as New Jersey corporations

9

for this purpose.

10

Thank you very much.
