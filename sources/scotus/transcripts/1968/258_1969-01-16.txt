ORAL ARGUMENT OF OSMOND K. FRAENKEL, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

6

MR. FRAENKEL:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court:

8
This is an appeal from a decision of a three-judge
9
court in the Eastern District of New York, rejecting an attack
10
on the constitutionality of Section 2012 of the New York educa­
1i
tion law brought by this plaintiff representing himself and

12
others in the same class.

13
It deals with the qualifications for elections in
14
local school districts.
15
This particular statute restricts the voting to
IS
roughly two groups of persons.

The owners or renters of taxable

17
real estate and their spouses, although at the time the suit was

18
brought the spouse of a tenant was not qualified but has become
19
so since, and parents of children attending the local schools,

20
thus excluding persons like this particular plaintiff who is a

21
bachelor living — and adult, of course — living with his

22
23
24
25

parents, excluding also older people living with their children,
excluding lodgers and boarders and excluding residents of
property which happens to be non-taxable.

2

1

The majority of the court below upheld the law on the

2

grounds that the interest of the taxpayers and parents was more

3

direct than the interest of the other residents of the community

4

and that the state,, therefore, had the right to make that

5

distinction.
i

6
7
8
9

Judge Weinstein wrote a long and to our view, of course,
a most persuasive dissent.
Now the election system in New York with respect to
schools is most bizarre.

In a large city like New York, the

'50

school board is appointed although the projects for decentrali­

ii

zation of which the members of the court may have read and the

12

new proposal by the Board of Education which has been much

13 ]publicized would give all the residents of local districts the
14
15

right to elect their local school boards.
In some of the other cities in New York, school

16

boards are elected, large cities.

In all cities in New York

17

having a population of 125,000 or less, school boards are

13

elected by the entire electorate.

It is only in the so-called

19

country and suburban areas such as the one here involved out

20

on Long Island that there is this distinction and restriction

21

to taxpayers and parents.

22

The state doesn't really support that distinction by
*»

23
24
25

anything in which in our view conforms to this court's most
recent discussion of the question of equal protection in
Williams against Rhodes where the court noted that it would
3

1

have to balance the interest of the state in the exclusion

2

which it proposed against the interest of the parson excluded,,

3

Here the interest of the person excluded is quite obvious.

4

He is a resident of the community and particularly in modern

S

times with the growing interest in education, the growing

s

ferment not. only among the community people but among.the

7

students themselves as to how their education should be handled,

8

it would seem A priori that everyone in the community should

9

have a right to participate in the election of the school

10

11
12

13

officials provided there be any election at alio
This court having previously, of course, determined
that a state would have such local officials appointed.
Q

Mr. Fraenkel, the statute provides that only

14

people with these qualifications shall be entitled to vote at

15

any school meeting.

Are these actually meetings or are these —

58

A

Yes.

17

Q

Or are these secret ballots?

18

A

No, there are meetings.

19

Q

We are just talking about meetings?

20

A

There are meetings at which the members of the

25

22
23
24
25

school board are elected after nominations made by a certain
number of qualified electors.

They make the nominations.

And then there are also other matters which can be
disposed of at these meetings, certain tax matters, certain
matters relating to the -4

2

Q

Having to do with the schools?

2

A

Children out of the state, out of the district

3

and things of that sort»

4

5

Q

So these are actually meetings, and are they

public meetings?

Can anybody come to the meetings?

3

A

So far as I know, yes.

7

Q

And only these people can vote?

8

A

Only these people can vote.

9

Q

How often are these meetings held?

20

A

That I don't know.

1 would suppose at least once

12

a year, perhaps oftener.

Actually being a resident of the city

'12

of New York I am not too familiar with what goes on in the

S3

suburbs.

!4

Q

And this does not involve ballot box voting?

IS

A

No.

1S

Q

It involves voting in an open meeting?

27

A

That is right.

18

Q

Which people did you say are permitted to vote?

W

A

Roughly taxpayers and parents.

In other words,

20

the owners or renters of taxable real property and their

21

respective spouses.

22

Q

What about people under 21?

23

A

And the parents of children attending school.

24
25

No, they have to be qualified otherwise to vote in the state.
They have to be over 21.
5

1

Q

Can anyone over 21 vote?

2

A

No, not in New York.

3

■r°\

Q

I mean in these elections?

4

A

No»

No, in addition to these restrictions on the;
.

electorate, the elector has to be a qualified voter in the
.

6

state»

'1

of every resident of the community is clear»

8
3
10

1?

Now, as I was saying, I would suppose that the interest

What interest is it that the state is supposed to
preserve by this restriction?

It is rather difficult from the

papers to determine what that is.
In one place it is stated that this is an essential

12

restriction in order to prevent political maneuvering, but why

13

or how this is so is difficult to understand.

14

Why in the districts in the country, political

15

maneuvering is more suspect than in cities having under 125,000

16

persons isn't made clear anywhere.

1?

everybody who otherwise qualified can vote.

m
m
20

Q

And in those cities,

But we are not talking about the right to vote

that is provided by Federal law, are we?
A

No, we are dealing here only with the question

21

of equal protection of whether this is an improper discrimina­

22

tion by the state? we are not dealing, of course, with voting

23

for Federal officials.

24

Q

Or any constitutional issue?

A

Or any constitutional issue.

25

f

6

We are dealing with

j

1

%

a matter that is local in the sense that school elections don’t

2

deal wxth all the subjects which a community xs interested in.

3

But» nevertheless, in my view» the matter of education is of

4

such paramount importance that all members of the community

5

have an interest in it and should be allowed to vote barring

6

some specific reason.

7

Q

.

8
9

!

You assume the burden here» I take it, of proving!

an invidious discrimination of the plaintiff?
j
A

Yes and no.

Of course, always the person who

10

raises an equal protection point assumes the burden.

On the

11

other hand, once he has shown that there is a discrimination

12

and that he has a strong interest, then I submit it is the

13

burden of the state to come forward to show a justification for
• •

14

IS
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

that discrimination.
Q

Do you have any cases for that except in areas

where certain particular interests are involved?
A

Of course, the most recent application of it

was in the Williams-Rhodes case where it is true that that
dealt with Federal electors.
Q

That is right.

A

And for that reason this court may have — if I

may be permitted to say so — stretched a little bit.

Never­

theless, it seems to me that the basic principle enunciated
that where a discrimination has been shown -—•
Q

That isn’t the normal equal protection lavz, is it?
7

A

i

There is the normal equal

protection law deals

p

mostly with taxation and routine things of that sort.

3

that when it deals with so fundamental a thing as voting and

4

the poll tax case, of course, is another illustration.

fi»

I submit

S

Q

How long has this law been on the books?

6

A

Oh, generations.

It has been changed from time

7

to time by some amelioration.

And it may be of interest that

8

when the Constitution was proposed in New York in 1967, that

9

Constitution would have expressly forbidden any such restriction
'

10

in local elections.
That Constitution for many reasons was not adopted by

11
12
13

14

IS
16
17
18

19
20

the people as your Honor knows.
One of the arguments made here is that the statements j
justify in making this discrimination because those two groups
are likely to be most interested and best informed.

to me the short answer to that is that anybody who wants to
vote who lives in the community shows an interest, and shouldn’t
be deprived of that right.
It is also suggested in one of the briefs that there
is a political process available to amend the law and that law
from time to time has been amended.

2?
22
23
24

It seems

knows how long it might take.

That may be true.

Lord

But that is I suggest no answer

at all to any constitutional argument.
In every case where a statute is challenged denying

-

25

the equal protection clause, it is, of course, possible to have
8

1

the statute amended whether it was a tax case or any other kind

2

of a case.

3

It is also suggested in some of the briefs — or I

4

will put it this way — horrible examples are produced at least

S

in one of the briefs about what would happen if this restriction

6

were removed.

7

It is said a child of eight from California could

8

come and show an interest.

That is, of course, nonsense.

9

Because the basic requirement for voting in New York is a

10

certain amount of residence in the state and in the district»

n

And that provision is not being attacked in this lawsuit.

12

All that we are saying is that that provision as to

13

the general voting qualification of New York should be

14

applicable here.

15

It is also suggested that if this law is stricken

16

down, there will be no law for school elections and that would

17

produce chaos.

IS

Now, of course, that is not true because all we are

19

asking this court to do is to strike down the discrimination

20

of the law.

21

first portion of the lav? which says persons are qualified to

22

vote in school elections who are qualified under the general

23
24
25

It is very easily accomplished because after the

lav/ of the state and possess certain additional qualifications,
all wa are asking is, "and possess these additional qualifi­
cations" be stricken.

And that would leave the law in full
9

1

force applicable to the school elections in these districts

2

but giving the right to vote in those districts to persons

3

otherwise qualified to vote in New York»

4

So in sum, our position is that this plaintiff and

5

others similarly situated have a vital interest, in the subject

6

matter being members of the community who want, to vote and

7

participate in the election of the school officials and that

8

the mare fact that taxpayers and parents might have what might

9

be called a more direct interest is no justification.

I

I

10

Indeed, one of the briefs goes so far as to suggest

11

that if it were otherwise a theoretical delicate balance between

12

the normal desire of taxpayers to keep school budgets down and

13

the hopeful desire of parents of better education and better

14

facilities and therefore increase the school budget, that that

15

nice balance that might be preserved by the existing system

16

would be thrown out if outsiders came in who were in need of

17

financially prejudiced group, whereas on the contrary, it would

18

seem to be in the general public interest that this possible

19

theoretical deadlock would be resolved by persons having a

20

general public interest in the education of the children and

21

in all of the other aspects that arise in connection with local

22

school elections because there are various collateral, and what

i

23
24

25

j

might be called fringe aspects to those situations, the local
school board has great power in connection with the recreation
facilities, libraries and things of that sort.
10

I

|r
f

So we say here that the state has not shown anything

1
2

to justify this discrimination and that the

3

visions of the law should toe stricken the court»

On the other hand, of course the education lav; of the
state is a matter of which this court takes judicial notice
and it has the provisions which deal with these matters and
some of those provisions are referred to in some detail in
various of the briefs.

.

22
23
24
25

In my own brief I refer to four or five sections of
the New York education law which indicate the powers of the
local boards.
Q

Do you have conveniently at hand a reference to
11

the sections of the education law that set out the powers of

5

A

The local school board which is elected.

here refers to voting at the school meeting.

To some extent, this has been covered also in the

opinion of the three-judge court at page 34 of the opinion —

to Mr. Justice Fortas' question, the school meeting also has

13

the right to deal with certain financial matters, school houses,

14

education of children outside the district and education of

IS

migrant laborers5 children inside the district.
In other words, there are various things which a

16

17

school meeting deals with at which these people would then have

18

the right to vote, not merely the selection of the members of

19

the board.

It is pointed out in one of the briefs that if this

20

laurfc should agree with us, perhaps some of the powers of these

21

meetings might be curtailed.

woMd have the right to do that but that is not anything with

And the legislature, of course,

which I suggest this court need concern itself.

As on disciplinary rules at these meetings?

No, no, the Board of Education presumably would

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JOHN P. JEHU, ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. JEHU:

10

11

court:
This is a very important case I believe and it is also

12
13

I believe one of first impression.
It involves such matters as the relationship between

21
22
23
24
25

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

a state and the Federal Government and also between the judiciary
and the legislative branches.

Now perhaps in answer to some

of the questions, questions asked of Mr. Fraenkel I shall say
this:

That Boards of Education in school districts in the

State of New York are autonomous units.
The statute sets for instance the requirements as to
required subjects in the curriculum.

Beyond that the local

board of education cas* determine to add other subjects

of

their choice.
The Board of Regents and the Commissioner of
Education, of course, have supervisory powers.
19

The Commissioner

1

has particularly judicial powers of the school system where

2

regular pleadings and oral arguments and briefs are filed and

3

so forth and then the statutes in New York says its decisions

4
5

are final and are not subject to review.
'
The courts of the state, however, have reviewed them

s

all along»

i

7

But in any event, the districts are very autonomous,
>
j
There are over 800 school districts in the state. The statute

3

here, 2012, and I might add to that also, requires three general

9

qualifications together with one of three specials.
The three generals are residence, citizenship and

1G

11

majority.

In addition to that, one of three qualifications

12

have to bring a qualified voter to be qualified into the com­

13

munity of interest in the school system which is a special

14

purpose administrated to the non-legislative unit.

15

is

All it does

administer the schools.
Under the general jurisdiction of the Education

16

n

Department because under the State Constitution and the law in

m

New York, education is a state function as it is under the Tenth

19

Amendment.

Now to go into the problem of this particular case.

20
21

22
23
24
25

It is a state function.

This is a matter as I said under the Tenth Amendment of state
concern only.

There xs nothing in the Unxted States Consti­

tution or xn any act of Congress that guarantees to anybody in
this country the right to vote at school district meetings or
elections,

This is a requirement of law.

Every one of these

11

districts involved here has to have an annual meeting, taking

12

place in May, June or July by local option.

Secondly, they must adopt a budget for the operating
expenses in the district for the ensuing year.
In addition to that, they can’t have any number of
other resolutions such as a purchase of a school bus or the
building of some extra class rooms as they may be required or
the putting up of a brand new building.

They are matters of

the administration of this school system of the local school
system for the students residing in the district and to take
care of their particular problems.

Does that answer your question?

I am sorry, but it doesn't quite.

This is a

In other words, all these voters do really —- this is

I have just gotten a copy of the statute brought

to me.

And the statute does not indicate that it has to be a

real property tax, does it?
A

Well, the tax provisions were taken out of the

12

State Education Law many years ago and put into the real

'13

property tax law.

14

You can't show me anything in this lav/ —

In the Education Law?

of the school meetings that we are talking about to the levying

21

of real estate taxes?

Well, as I indicated, your Honor, this is no

longer in the Education Law.

I am looking at Section 2021.
26

I am still trying

to find out what the powers of this meeting are.

The powers of the meeting basically —

Q

That is what I am trying to find out.

i

3

When you

4

corae to the power to tax, 1 want tc know specifically in terms

5

of the statute whether the taxing power is limited to levying

6

of tax on real property.

7

Obviously the reason that X am interested in that is

3

that the section at issue here, which is 2012, confines the powe,

9

to vote to persons who own, et cetera, real property.

10

h

Right.

Well, the power to tax is limited in

11

answer to your Honor's question absolutely and definitely to

12

real property taxes.

13

it is in another statute that the matter was transferred to.

But that is not in the Education Law, but

14

Starting with Section 1300 of the real property tax

15

law, 1 don't at the moment remember which one of the three or

16

four sections following 1300 it is.

17
13
19

Q

Does the state submit any of its tax receipts

to the school districts for their operation?
A

The operations of the school districts of the

20

state are financed basically from the school tax, which is the

21

real property tax.

22
23
24
25

In addition to that, they get a great amount

of state aid and that state aid and this will be part of my
argument about some of the claims made here, that state aid is
derived from a number of sources.
The state income tax and various corporation taxes

27

I

1

and there is a whole flock of sources,-

The budget xs made up ■—

2

Q

I suppose

3

A

We have a state sales tax now, that is correct,

do you have a sales tax?

4

which is also part of that.

5

like New York City and some of the counties have sales taxes,

6

hut all of these things go into the state budget.

7

tttat budget xs made up, a new formula is made up, a state aid

Then we have local

sales taxes

And before

8

formula is made up almost every year and that formula determines

9

how much the taxes will have to be brought into the state

10

caucus in order to cover these various expenses, including

11

education.

12

13

Q

Do these people who are deprived of voting under

this law have to pay those state taxes?

14

A

Oh, indeed they do, your Honor.

15

Q

Then they do contribute with their tax moneys

16

to the support of these schools, do they not.

17

A

The main part, if it please the Chief Justice,

18

of my argument is this

19

Q

Oh, I am not interested in your argument.

20

A

No, on this point is what I mean.

21

Q

I would just like to ask you if they are obliged

22
23
24
2S

to pay state taxes that are used to operate the schools?
A

That is absolutely correct.

Federal taxes go into that picture.

And some of the

is that he has never lost and doss not now lose his franchise on

state legislation which determines how much of his tax money

goes into the educational system.

And he. has not lost his

franchise to elect a Senator of the United States or Congressman,
■

4

who an turn determine how much Federal money goes back to the

5

state for schools.

6
7

And this I think is a vital distinction in this case
from some of the cases the court has recently decided.

8
9
10

This he can vote on.

Q

It might determine how much he would be willing

to put into the local budget, then, wouldn’t it, depending on
how much he was to get from the state?

t?

A

No.

12

Q

Why?

13

A

As 1 said

14

Q

Why?

15

A

The whole state aid formula is a most complicated

—

18

kind of machinery.

17

that district to spend, shall we say, $5 million for their

18

schools.

19

covered by an estimate of how much they will get from state aid,

20

how much Federal aid will they get and how much will they get

21

from other various sources of income such as tuition and so

22

forth, and then they deduct that and the difference the Board

23

of Education levies in taxes on the real property in the

24

district.

25

What the voters do is they merely authorise

And that authorization to spend then has to be

Because he has to pay the state and Federal taxes regard­

less of whether it is spent in this district or it will go to
Oklahoma or California.

If that district doesn't spend it,

somebody will, and the total amount is the same either way.
Q

j

Why do you give the right to vote to the tax­

payers who are owners of property?
A

Well, may I point --

Q

What are the reasons for that?

A

May I explain this.

Would X assume it is because they are interested

in how their money is spent?

Would that be one of the reasons?

This may well be one of the reasons.

Q

Why exclude a bachelor who might be the highest

taxpayer in the country?

8

9

Because he is not a member of the community
;
Because he is not interested in what happens to

his tax money?

10

A

Wo.

11

Q

Suppose the law said only Republicans can vote,

12

A

That, would be an invidious discrimination.

13

Q

Why?

14

A

Because there is no relation between the purpose

15

of a statutory objective o£ the legislature and the way they

16

are doing it.

In other words, a Democrat ■—-

17

Q

What is the relationship for excluding a bachelor'5

18

A

Well, he is not being excluded because he is a

19

bachelor.

He is excluded because he has absolutely no

Q

He is excluded because he is not married?

21

A

Wo.

22

He is excluded because he has absolutely

no interest in the school system.

His children are not affected because he has no

He could vote.

Now what interest does that man have?

Absolutely.
This

16

bachelor who is broke and just happens to be a tenant, what

17

interest does he have?

18

A

Well, the question really, your Honor, is this?

19

In the first place, do we have to meet a test such as we had

20

in the Cardona case.

21

9

will not be adequate and at the same time it was done.

10

The statement was made that

And we have, as I pointed out in our supplemental

11

brief, there is now a constitutional amendment again before the

12

State Legislature to eliminate all of these special things.

13

But the purpose of it all, and this is to answer your question,

14

Mr. Justice Marshall, in order for the Legislature to make sure

15

that this extremely important business of elementary and

1G

secondary education is properly determined on the local basis

17

where it has to be determined under state lav;, we must make

18

sure that those people who get the franchise on that are those

19

people who can reasonably be expected to be interested enough

20

in it to spend a considerable amount of time necessary to

21

really inform yourself on these very complicated questions.

And he is living

with one of those children.
Do you say that that person would not have sufficient
interest in the public school system of his district to vote?

I would say, your Honor, that they are properly

excluded here because the parents themselves, that is the
children of the people we are talking about, whose grandchildren
are involved, do have the franchise, but the interest of these

--- if we sustain this, could you also say that unless he paid

14

AFTERNOON SESSION
(The oral argument in the above-entitled matter was
resumed at 12's30 p.ra»>
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Jehu, you may continue

your argument.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. JEHU, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES (resumed)

7
8

MR. JEHU:

Thank you, your Honor.

9

The first thing I would like to refer to in these last

10

few minutes is that the first rationale of this statute.

11

Section 2012, means that these people have more information and

12

have more of an interest in getting the information.

13

You take the parents.

They are continuously bombarded]
I

14

by various circulars and leaflets that the school sends home

13

with the children.

18
17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Here is what we are trying to do.

The same thing is true with these taxpayers.

They

are on the tax list and the assessment list and they send them
certain things in order to make them vote for whatever they need
Q

What about the school teacher that I asked about

who is boarding in some home?
A

She is not enfranchised here, that is true.

Q

Can she vote?

A

Well, if she is not a renter or owner of taxable

property and she has no children in school, she cannot vcte.
Q

Yes, she is a boardex', and not a general taxpayer
38

1

h

If she pays no rent# then she cannot vote.

2

Q

You put it on the interest now that they might

3

have and they are better able to have an interest# would you

4

say that she is less able to have that interest?

5

A

On the interest,, your Honor, that the Legislature

6

can't foresee that such people will have.

But the class as a whole

And may 1 say this# the qualification# of a residence#

10

11

which is universal, this court has upheld it a number of times.

12

I am not talking about Carrington now.
Q

13
14

What percentage of the voters attend these

meetings?
A

15

That is a difficult question to answer, your

16

Honor.

In my district which is out in the country# we have

17

voted as many as 6,000 when we built a new high school# a

18

controversial thing.

19

is 200 or 300 people come out.

When you vote on $4 million budget# there
It is not good.

20

Q

Very low percentage.

21

A

It is, yes.

22

Q

Well# would I assume that all the people that

23

are not there are not interested?

24

A

I can't answer that question, your Honor.

25

Q

What is not good# the fact that you have this few?
39

1

A

That we have a low attendance, that is right.

2

Q

That you have as many as 6*000 voting?

3

A

No, I think every voter could turn out.

That

4

is the privilege of this country to vote on things, you see.

5

That is why they should turn out.
But to come back to this, residence is something

6

7

which everybody has agreed is a proper voting qualification.

8

Why?

9

closely exposed to the problems of the area, of the unit,

10
11

Because a resident can be reasonably expected to be more

whatever unit it is.
He is more closely exposed to the candidates, the

12

facts involved.

13

that this gives more knowledge, more interest in terms of

14

information, mors intelligently informed electorate.

15

Therefore, I urge the court to assume as I do

The second point is that we have here a party

16

political problem.

We are trying to keep party politics out of

17

t ha school system.

Now we have different times of the year to

18

vote and we have different voting qualifications.

19

first line of defense.against encroachment of party politics.

20

Here is how it happens.

21

22
£3
24
25

That is the

We had in the city school districts, the smaller ones,
they changed this to the normal voting qualifications.
Q

Tell me, what percentage of the people over 21

would you say would be disenfranchised by this?
A

A fairly small number, I think.
40

Q

1
2

Very small, wouldn’t it?

Almost everyone rents,

pays some rent or owns a horae and all?

3

A

That is right.

4

You see the difference in voting qualifications makes

5

it impossible, it throws this May, June or July meeting into

6

November.

7

is exactly what happened in the smaller 56 city school districts

8
9

And the minute you change those qualifications, that

It is why can’t we save the money instead of having
the meeting —-

10

Q

Well, this is really the state’s interest then?

11

A

This is part of it.

12

Q

This is really, because I can’t imagine you are

13

really having any substantial interest in keeping this small

14

percentage of people from participating in the meetings as

15

IS
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

compared to such a large group anyway and such a small group
that really attends.
A

Well, Mr. Justice White, I see that this is a

thing about which reasonable men can and will differ.

But all

I am really getting at is that the state here has broad powers.
As Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out in Carrington, Mr. Justice
Douglas in Lassiter and Harper, they have a broad interest
unless they violate something guaranteed by the United States
Constitution„
They should be given the latitude.
Q

But with this device anyway there is some
41

1

justification for having a special election?
v

Indeed, yes.

15

not —•-

16

A

Well, you see, in other words, we have had times

17

in the State of New York where a teacher had to pay X dollars

18

to the party caucus or whoever was in power.

19

it used to be that the Eureau president used to determine who

20

teaches and what they get.

22

In New York City

Now they eliminated that by this

24

5

District B and they vote on whether to send them over here or

7

difference does it make where those kids get sent?

So they make a contract with District A or

By the handful of children in the school, what

You could say all right, District A charges $800

8
9

Districts sometimes do not have a high school or senior

tuition and District B charges $1,U0Q.

So he has an interest

10

if he pays,? but he doesn't.

So no matter how you slice it,

11

he has actually no interest

and if he has no interest 1 don’t

12

see how he can be protected by the

United States Constitution.

I might say this also in answer to a question by the

you don't have this restriction?

the same thing true with respect to the other powers?

Is that correct?

in those places.

Q

All right, hut you understand what 1 mean.

2

There is no provision setting up in those jurisdictions, those

cities, there is no provision setting up a specially defined

4

electorate for school matters?
A

5

That is correct.

People don5t really vote for

S

the Mayor because of who he puts on the Board of Education.

7

Some might.
But anyhow, may I just quote, to finish, Mr. Justice

S
9

Douglas.

He said, and I quote, "’There is no group more

10

interested in the operation and management of the public

ri

schools than the taxpayers who support them and the parents

12

whose children attend them."

13

That is exactly what this statute does.

14

Q

Who said that?

15

A

Mr. Justice Douglas.

And Doramus.

And I might

IS

say and we now have five judges have agreed with a rationality

17

of this statute and we have the Court of Appeals of the State

18

of New York has passed on this question also, in the Turk!®

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

matter.
In addition we have Mr. Justice Douglas stating as
it did and Mr. Justice Brennan in Moyum and any other conclusion
would mean that they are blind to the realities with which the
legislature of the state is familiar.
And so 1 submit that the judgment should be affirmed.
Thank you.

MR. FRAENKEL;

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF OSMOND K. FRAENKEL, ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

4

MR. FRAENKEL;

In the first place, I don't expect that

5

this court is much persuaded by the counting of judicial

6

noses in courts below.

7

This court has shown a great recognition of its

8

peculiar function.

9

considered.

I don't think that argument should be

As to this business of being informed because material

10
11

is sent, but, of course, if everybody could vote the material

12

would be sent to all the other people who could vote.
I suggest, therefore, that none of the consideration

13
14

—• the special election business — I suggest has no meaning

15

at all.

16

the state v/ants to preserve, all it does is make that mandatory

17

on the school district.

18

by the nature of the electorate at the election.

19

Because if that is an important consideration which

That is not in the least effective

And finally, I think it was a little inaccurate when

20

my opponent said that in the cities the voters do not vote

21

for school boards.

22

not true in cities of under 125,000 because there all

23

qualified voters do vote for the boards of election.

24

25

Q

That is true in the large cities.

It is

Mr. Fraenkel, how do you explain the state's

great interest in this matter in the sense that
46

1

A

I don't.

2

Q

In the sense that the electorate is already very

C*

large and there is not a great turnout at meetings anyway and

4

there won't be a very large number of people affected, by this

5

law?
A

6

I am frankly at a loss to understand why the

7

state should be concerned because as Your Honor says, the number

0

affected in most districts would be relatively small,

9

conceivable that there are some districts which have peculiari­

10

ties,, a large number ot people perhaps are living in tax exempt

11

residences, something of that sort.

It is

12

But normally the number would be small and it could

13

possibly have no significant effect on the policies which the

14

state is interested in.

15

therefore the burden is on this court to resolve it.
Thank you.

16

Oh, I assume that the material which I offered to

27
18

send can be sent here.

21

22
23

It doesn't need to be printed?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

29

But they do oppose our position and

Yes,,you may send it that

way.
