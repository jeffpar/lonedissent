ARGUMENT OF ROGER ROBB, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. ROBB:

May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice:

3

The facts in this case may be briefly stated.
In 1964, the petitioner Red Lion broadcast a. 15-minute

10
11

program by one Billy James Hargis in which Mr. Hargis attacked

12

Mr. Fred J. Cook in connection with a book that Mr. Cook had

14

15
16
17
13
19

20
21

22
23

25

written.

The Hargis talk was part of a series and was carried

on a number of other radio stations and Red Lion was paid for
the time.
Having learned of the attack, Mr. Cook wrote to Red
Lion, invoking the so-called “personal attack doctrine" of the
Federal Communications Commission, and demanding that he be
given time to reply.
In response, Red Lion offered to make time available
to Mr. Cook at the station®s regular rate, or to give Mr. Cook
free time if he stated that he could not pay for time.

Mr. Cook

rejected the offer of time on a paid basis and refused to state
that he could not pay for time, and he complained to the Federal
Communications Commission that Red Lion was in Violation of the
2

1

so-called personal attack doctrine»

2

2

The Commission ruled that, having presented a personal

3

attack on an individual, and his honesty, character or integrity

4

in connection with a controversial matter of public importance,

5

Red Lion was bound by the personal attack rule and doctrine to

6

inform Mr. Cook, the individual involved, of the attack, to send

7

him a tape or a transcript or a summary of the broadcast, and

8

upon his demand, to afford him free time to reply.
The Commission held that Mr, Cook was under no ofoli-

9

i

10

gation to make any showing of inability to pay.

11

directed to comply with this ruling.

12

Court of Appeals of this circuit, which sustained the Commis­

3

Red Lion was

Red Lion appealed to the

sion's ruling, and this Court thereafter granted certiorari.
I might interpolate that, as this Court has recog­

4
5

nized, this case is a companion case and closely involved with

6

the next case, No. 7 7, but the Red Lion situation involved a

7

specific application of the rule involved in No. 7 7.
In the interest of clarity, it might be helpful at the

8
9
20
21

22
23
24
25

outset to suggest certain matters which I conceive are not in
issue here.
*

First, there is no question but that the Hargis broad­

cast contained a personal attack on Mr. Cook within the meaning
of the definition of the FCC»
Second, there is no issue as to the truth or falsity
of the Hargis broadcast or the good faith of Hargis in making it
3

1

or the good faith of Red Lion in broadcasting it.

2

The ruling of the Commission and the opinion of the

3

court below make it clear that these matters were held to be

4

immaterial»

5

the Commission's order whether the broadcast was true, or false,

6

and whether the broadcaster carried it believing it to be true

7

or not»
Third, and obviously, there is no issue here as to

8
9
10

In other words, Red Lion was bound to comply with

whether Mr» Hargis and his philosophy, or Mr. Cook and his, are
worthy or unworthy»

The issue is simply one of law, without re­

gard to the personal beliefs or philosophies of the individuals
12

involved.

Were it otherwise, I might not be here.

3

Fourth, it is conceded, I believe, by the Government,

14

perhaps with some qualifications, that radio and television are

15

part of the press protected by the B'irst Amendment.

6

I am informed that Mr. Cox, in No. 7 7, itfill discuss

7

rather fully the statutory questions involved here.

I would liks,

8

if I might, to focus briefly upon the constitutional question.

9

Simply stated, the issue here, I suggest, is whether

20

or not the order of the Federal Communications Commission to

21

Red Lion imposes a burden of previous restraint upon free speech

22

and the press which is forbidden by the First Amendment.

23

this order impose on Red Lion a burden?

24
25

We submit that obviously it does.

Doss

The burden consists

of the cost of preparing a tape or a transcript, of sending it
4

1

to the individual attacked, and providing free time, and perhaps,

2

and I emphasize this, perhaps providing free time by displacing

3

some other program which is paid for.
This, as I understand the Government3s brief, they

4
5

concede, that a burden is imposed»

But they assert, somewhat

S

blandly I think, that the cost is not substantial and the bur­

7

den is not undue; and likewise, Judge Tamm thought that such a

a

burden was not unreasonable»

9

Now, in general, we challenge the proposition, but the

10

exercise of First Amendment rights may be burdened with a finan­

II

cial penalty so long as the Government or the Federal Communi­

12

cations Commission thinks the amount of the penalty is reason­

13

able.
We ask:

14

What standard does the Government apply to

15

determine what is reasonable and what is not?

16

ment say that a large Chicago television station, which is re­

17

quired to donate 15 minutes of time for which a commercial spon­

18

sor would be charged $2,0.00, would the Government say that that

19

station is not subjected to an unreasonable and onerous burden?

20

We submit that the commandment of the First Amendment

21

is simply;

22

abridge, but please try to keep it reasonable."

23
24
25

Thou shalt not abridge.

Would the Govern­

And it is not "you may
In any event,

the impact of a financial penalty and, the threat of future pen­
alties are serious matters for Red Lion Broadcasting Company.
This station is located in the City of Red Lion, Pennsylvania,
5

1

which is a small town having a population of less than 6,000»

2

As the record discloses, it is a daytime-only station, which inus;

3

compete for revenues with two full-time and one daytime station

4

located in York, Pennsylvania, and a full-time station in Hanover,

5

Pennsylvania»
York, the County Seat, with a population of some

6

7

55,000, is only six miles away.

Hanover is 18 miles away.

8

for a small station facing such competition, any donation of

9

free time, as a practical matter, is not a trivial concern, and

10

repeated donations might very well drive the station out of

11

existence.

12

Q

Does your burden argument turn entirely on the

13

financial aspects of this?

Now,

A

Does Your Honor refer, by "the other burden," to —

Q

Interruption of other programs, and so forth?

A

Yes, indeed.

Q

But initially you started off to comply with the

Commission's regulation on the condition that they would pay you
or prove indigency, so to speak.
A

Yes, sir.

But I think we have to consider, in

analyzing the effect of this order of regulation, consider the
entire impact of it on the station, and the disruption of pro­
gramming for a station is a very serious matter.
Q

.Mr. Robb, is there any possibility of putting it
S

1

on the ptablic time?

2

is that right?

3

A

The station has a certain amount of that;

Yes» sir.

The record shows, Mr. Justice Marshall

4

that this station carries one hour a day called "Free Speech,"'1

5

and on this program anyone who wishes to appear may appear.

Q

don't know whether Mr. Cook would insist the station pay his ex­

7

penses to get there or not.

That might be a possibility.

I mentioned the possibility of repeated requests for

There is no doubt that the rule of the FCC in this

donations.

10

case would expose the station to repeated demands for free time

II

unless the station steered clear of the dangerous xone of personal

12

attack.
This very broadcast is a good illustration of this

13

14

proposition.

The broadcast is printed at pages 60 and 61 of the

15

appendix, and it appears therein that this one broadcast con­

16

tained attacks not only on Mr. Cook, but on three other people os

17

groups.

10

identified as Mr. Cook's pal.

19

He attacked Mr. Carey McWilliams, the editor of The Nation.

i

Mr. Hargis attacked a mart named Eugene Gleason,

whom he

He attacked a manasine, The Natior

Now, if Red Lion were obliged to devote time for a rep3 y

20
21

to each of these attacks, would the Government then say that the

22

cost and the disruption of the station's business were insubstan­

23

tial?

24
25

Now, I suggest that this broadcast, furthermore, is a
striking example of the fact that the personal attack doctrine,

7

1

as applied by the Commission, fragments every discussion of a

2

controversial matter of public interest and importance into as

3

many separate controversies and issues as there happen to be in­

4

dividuals or groups who happen to be attacked in the course of

5

the broadcast, and if the speaker happens to speak critically of

6

a dozen individuals, each of them thereby becomes instantly a

7

controversial matter or issue of public importance and the broad-

8

caster may be required to provide free time for a dozen answers,

9

which would be an onerous burden, indeed»

10

We think this threat is substantial.

We think of the

U

words of this Court in Cantwell against Connecticut, in which

12

the Court said this:

13

"It i§ not merely the sporadic abuse of power by the

14

censor, but the pervasive threat inherent in its very exis­

15

tence that constitutes the danger to freedom of discussion.*'

16

We ask, can it be said that the financial penalties

-j

17

and the other burdens — and the penalties, incidentally, have

18

the effect of a fine -- and the pervasive threat of similar

19

penalties in the future do not and could not have a chilling and

20

deterrent effect upon the exercise by Red Lion of its First

21

Amendment rights?

22

Do these penalties and burdens, and this threat for

23

the future, constitute an inhibition and a deterrent less sub™

24

stantial than the ones that were struck down by this Court in

25

Talley against California and Speiser against Randall?
8

1

We submit that the answer must be no.

We submit that

2

common sense tells us plainly that the application of the Com­

3

mission 3s ruling and the threat of future applications abound

4

to make Red Lion in the future more reluctant to broadcast any

5

material that involves a criticism of any individual or group.
Undoubtedly, we submit, Red Lion in the future will

6
7

tread more cautiously, steering wider of the dangerous zone of

8

criticism.

9

virulent for having been self-imposed.

10

The result will be self-censorship, nonetheless

Now, the Government argues that the personal attack

11

rule is necessary in order that the public may have both sides

12

of controversial issues, and specifically so the public may hear

13

both the attack and the answer.

14

looks the fact that if the personal attack rule is sustained, the

15

public is likely to hear neither the attack nor the answer, for

IS
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

The argument, we suggest, over­

the reason that the attack may never be broadcast at all.

In-

stead of stimulating wide open, robust, and unhibited debate,
the rule will tend to choke it off at the source. To prevent the
introduction of any alleged impurity into the strain, the Govern­
ment proposes to dry it up at its source.
Now, the Government argues further that a person at­
tacked on a number of radio stations may be financially unable
to pay for time on them all; therefore, says the Government, it
is right that he should be given free time.
One answer to this argument may be found, we think, ir
9

1

the language of this Court in Cantwell against Connecticut* where

2

the Court said, and I quote;

3

"To persuade others to his own point of view* the

4

pleader* as we know* at times* resorts to exaggeration* to

5

vilification of men who have been ox- who are prominent in

6

church or state* and even to false statement.

7

people of this Nation have ordained* in the light of bistort*

8

that in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses,

9

these liberties are* in the long run, essential to enlighteiji-

But the

SO

opinion and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a

11

democracy."

12

We submit in this case that the possibility of isolate!

13

abuses and individual cases of such abuses cannot justify the

14

imposition of a stifling blanket of restraint on the First Amend

15

meat rights of all broadcasting stations.

16

The Government's argument* when analyzed* rests on the

17

premise that those who listened* and who listen* to the programs

18

of Red Lion* have no other source of information.* no access to a

19

wide diversity of opinion.

20

of the argument.

The facts destroy the underpinning

21

According to the Broadcasting Yearbook and TV Digest

22

Fact Book for 1969* the residents of the City of Red Lion have

23
24
25

access to radio programs broadcast from nine towns or cities*
which are Hanover* Pennsylvania? Harrisburg, Carlisle* Elizabethtown* Lancaster* Lebanon* York* Philadelphia, and Baltimore.
10

?

They have access to television programs from five dif­

2

ferent cities, namely, Lancaster, Lebanon, Harrisburg, York, and

3

Baltimore,,
It is inconceivable that the listening audience in

4
5

Red Lion remains glued to that station's frequency, isolated and

6

insulated from all other sources of information and opinion»

7

The possibility of a failure of diversity of tongues and diversi :•Y

8

of opinions, we submit, is most remote.
Again, the Government relies upon the fact that this

9
10

11

Court held, in the National Broadcasting Company case, that
radio broadcasting is subject to regulation»

We agree.

It did

12

hold that.

13

Government may dictate the content of radio programs or impose

14

burdens on the exercise of First Amendment rights.

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

But it does not follow from that decision that the

The Government may assign frequencies and channels,
giving consideration to the character and the financial stand­
ing and ability of an applicant.

It may evaluate the total per­

formance of a broadcaster during the term of his license.

It

may supervise the methods of competition adopted by broadcasters.
But all such regulation, we submit, is a far cry from
the order to Red Lion, which dictates what the content of a
particular- pregram shall be, and who the speaker shall be.

Even

though Red Lion may have been fair, may have broadcast other
points of view, Red Lion is told by the Commission, ,!You must
put on Mr. Cook.

You must give him time.”

11

1

An order of this sort* we submit, is precisely the

2

kind of censorship and abridgement that the First Amendment con­

3

demns .

4

Now, as this Court has consistently held, when First

3

Amendment rights are tangled with conduct which the Government

6

may regulate, tie First Amendment rights must be preserved, and

7

they must i©t be curtailed by regulation directed at the abuses

a

which are subject to Government control.

9

freedom of speech and the press would always be subject to

Were it not so, then

10

abridgements and control by the subtle and indirect method of

11

associating them and their exercise with other conduct which

12

might be controlled.

13

Finally, the Government seeks comfort from the fact

14

that the number of radio frequencies is limited.

15

are told, that broadcasters hold these frequencies in trust for

16

the public and they must, therefore, bow to the interest of the

17

public as that may be interpreted and defined by the Commission.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

It follows, we

But the public streets, the public parks, the public
buildings are likewise held in trust for the public: yet this
Court has not permitted that fact .to justify restraints upon the
exercise therein of First Amendment rights.
In any event, we submit, the First Amendment rights
of radio broadcasters should not be conditioned on the number
of radio stations in existence.

Whether there be few or many

should not determine whether they should enjoy the protection

12

1

and the full protection, of the First Amendment.

2

Finally, if the number and diversity of tongues are

3

factors to be considered, we point to the fact that there are

4

more than 6,000 commercial radio stations in this country today,

5

3-1/2 times as many radio stations as there are daily newspapers

6

and we venture to say that the circulation and the listening

7

public of those radio stations far exceeds the circulation and

8

the reading public of daily newspapers.

9

Now, a xvord as to the Government argument that the

10

personal attack doctrine is authorized by statute, specifically,

11

Section 315 and other sections of the Communications Act.

12

Mr. Cox, as 1 am reliably informed, will discuss this

13

matter in his argument.

14

support and adopt Mr. Cox's argument.

15

briefly stated;

16

We have mentioned it in our brief.

We

We make these points very

In the first place, the statute defining the functions

17

powers and duties of the Federal Communications Commission cer­

18

tainly does not in terms authorize the personal attack rule.

ID

Certainly, we say, that meddling with the control of the pro­

20

grams or the content of programs is no part of the Federal Com­

21

munications Commission's function.

22

We suggest, furthermore, that a statute which purports

23

or is claimed to authorise impingement upon First Amendment rights

24

must be strictly construed and carefully examined.

25

not be broadly construed.
13

It should

1

With respect to the argument that the 1959 amendment

a

to Section 315(a) authorized the personal attack rule, we point

3

out that that amendment was adopted three years before the per­

4

sonal attack rule was articulated by the Federal Communications

5

Commission and, therefore, it seems somewhat difficult to con­

6

clude that the Congress intended in terms to refer to that rule

7

and to authorize it.
We point out and suggest also that the purpose of the

3

9

j

1959 amendment was to cure a blackout which had been caused by

10

a free-time requirement and, therefore, it seems somewhat anoma­

11

lous to argue that Congress intended by this curative amendment

12

to authorize a similar blackout caused by a free-time require­

13

ment.

14

Of course, we say also that if the statute doss pur­

15

port to authorise any such action by the Commission, the statute

16

is pro tanto unconstitutional.

17

In conclusion, we submit that this case plainly demon­

13

strates the wisdom of what this Court said in Roth against the

19

United States, and repeated in Smith against California.

20

Court said, and I quote:

Q

Mr. Robb, under the current rules of the Commis­

6

sion, if the station had broadcast this attack in the course of

7

a regular news program, would there have to be a reply, a right

8

to reply afforded?

3

A

Mr. Justice White, I read those new rules, and

10

to tell you the truth, I am not sure what the answer would ba,

11

because I know those rules exclude regular news programs from

12

the coverage of the personal attack doctrine, but whether this

13

could be construed as a news program, I really don't know, sir.

14

Q

Well, assuming for the moment that the station

15

could do this, I suppose you would still be hare making this

16

same argument.

17

A

Yes, sir.

18

Q

Because you think you should be protected in

19

selling the right to others to make these personal attacks.

20

A

Yes, sir.

21

Q

If the station itself wants to put out its own

22

views, sponsor it, it has ample opportunity within the present

23

rules to make personal attacks or anything it wants to, without

24

affording an opportunity for a response, doesn’t it?

25

A

Well, that I think involves the so-called
15

1

editorialising rule, which is involved in 717.

2

leave that question to the experts.

3

of course, it wouldn't get paid for that broadcast.

Q

I prefer to

But I suppose so.

But,

I suppose it bears on your constitutional argu­

ment, though, to some extent.

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

At least insofar as your argument rests on some

a

suggestion that it is the degree of the seriousness of the inva1

9

sion that is the element here.

Yes, sir.

13

A

14

We submit, in conclusion, that the personal attack

intrusions on First Amendment rights.

you do not.

you can abridge just a little bit, or reasonably.

I will try to keep my argument separated as far as
the two cases are concerned, but much of the argument is neces­

In the first place, I would like to make it plain that

this is not a sudden determination of the Federal Communications

Commission that it will be righteous and seek to enforce some

The first traces of it that I have seen are

found in an address of the then Secretary of Commerce, Herbert
Hoover, in 1924, when the Commerce Department was charged with
the licensing of radio stations, and he pointed out that there
were great problems in the handling of this new medium, and that
problems of seeing that all points of view were properly expressed

were among them.
In its foundation, the problem is inherent in communi-|

But I feel that substantial progress has been made in
dealing with a fundamental and important issue.
Let me start by referring to some reflections of the
problem which are found in the basic statute.

I am going to

quote a few passages from the Communications Act of 1934, but I

14

would point out that virtually all of these were also in the

15

Federal Radio Act of 1927.

ta

25

The very opening sentence says, in

Section 301 of Title 47:
"It is the purpose of this chapter, among other things,
to maintain the control of the United States over all the
channels of interstate and foreign radio transmission, and
to provide for the use of such channels, but not the owner­
ship thereof, by persons for limited periods of time, and
no license granted under this section shall be construed to
create any right beyond the terms, conditions, and period
of the license."
In Section 303, there is an express provision that
19

i

1

a license may be revoked if the licensee has transmitted super­

2

fluous radio communications or signals, or communications con­

3

taining profane or obscene words, language or meaning, and I sup-

4

pose it is reasonably plain that a station’s license could be

5

revoked under that section, even though the language used was

6

such that it could not have been enjoined from being used be­

7

cause of the First Amendment.

■

Then there are provisions for licensing, under which

8

9

the Commission, if public convenience, interest or necessity

10

will be served thereby, may grant licenses for periods of three

11

years.
There are provisions for revocation of licenses in

12

13
14

case the station does not serve the public interest, convenience
and necessity.
There are provisions for revocation of licenses in

15
16

17
18

cases of willful and repeated violations of or willful or re­
peated failure to observe any provision of this chapter, or any
rule or regulation of the Commission authorised by this chapter.
Then there is Section 315, the equal-time provision,

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

and I point out that that was included in the Federal Radio Act
of 1927.

It is, thus, 42 years old.

In its particular field it

is an expression of the fairness doctrine under which, if a
station gives time to a political candidate, it must give equal
time to other political candidates, with qualifications which
were put in in 1959 and to which I will refer a little later.
20

1

In 1929, in a brief which the Commission filed in the j

2

Great Lakes case, you find something of a beginning of an articu­

3

lation of the fairness doctrine.

4

Commission, in a series of individual rulings, undertook to ex­

5

press the obligation of then radio stations to meet the require­

6

ments of the fairness doctrine, this being an interpretation by

7

the Commission of the standard included by Congress in the

8

statute that these stations must operate in the public interest.

Over the next two decades, the

In 1960, -- well, let me v/ait before 1959 and 1960.

9
10

In 1940, in the ruling in the Mayflower Broadcasting

11

case, the Commission instructed radio stations that they could

12

not engage in editorializing.

13

right thing to do.

14

trine .

15

This may or may not have been the

It was an articulation of the fairness doc­

There was concern that the stations with the great

16

power they have, could constantly reiterate one point of view

17

and shut off all others, and the Commission's approach in 1940

18

was to say "You cannot editorialize."

19

But in 1949, after experience with that, the Commis­

20

sion issued its report on editorializing in which it changed its

21

rule and it said, "You can editorialize, but you must allow an

22

opportunity for response by responsible people."

23
24
25

That was the situation in 1949.

Ten years later we

come to 1959, when after the Lar Daly case which arose under
Section 315 involving equal time, there was great concern becaus e
21

1

the Commission and a Court of Appeals had held that every candi­

2

date was entitled to equal time, even though he had only a

3

miniscule support.

4

provide that appearances on a bona fide newscast, a bona fide

5

news interview, a bona fide news documentary, and on-the-spot

6

coverage of news events, need not be taken into account in

7

determining the long-established Congressional mandate, an ex-

8

pression, I believe, of the notion of the fairness doctrine of

9

equal time for political candidates.

10
11

Congress amended Section 3.15 in 1959 to

Then it is vary significant, I think, that as a part
of that amendment, Congress enacted these words;

12

"Nothing in the foregoing sentence" — that is, the

13

exception of bona fide news broadcasts —■ "shall be con­

14

strued as relieving broadcasters, in connection with the

15

presentation of newscasts, news interviews, news documen­

IS

taries, and on-the-spot coverage of news events, from the

17

obligation imposed upon them under this chapter to operate j

13

in the public interest and to afford reasonable opportunity

19

for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public

20

importance."

21

22
23
24
25

The statute also provided, in paragraoh (c)?
"The Commission shall prescribe appropriate rules and
regulations to carry out the provisions of this section."
Since our brief was filed, I came across another re­
lated matter.

In 1960, Congress suspended the equal-time
22

1

provision for the 1960 Presidential campaign only.

2

statute, which was a temporary statute and, therefore, isn’t,

3

included in the U.S. Code, there was this additional sentence:

4

In that

"Nothing in the foregoing shall be construed as reliev

5

ing broadcasters from the obligation imposed upon them unde r

6

this Act to operate in the public interest."

7

Now, that is merely cumulative.

It adds nothing to

S

the provision that is in Section 315, but it does show the con­

9

tinuing concern of Congress to maintain the requirement of

10

operation in the public interest not as a mere private venture,

11

which is the heart of the fairness doctrine.

12

Finally, some four years later, the Commission put out

13

a report which is called "The Fairness Primer."

As it appears

14

in the Federal Register, it looks like this.

15

a digest of the decisions which the Commission had reached in

16

this area, followed by two appendices which are reports of the

17

Commission.

10

torializing by broadcast licensees.

19

and comprehensive history of the fairness doctrine.

20

In putting this out, the Commission said:

21

"It is the purpose of this public notice to advise

It is, in essence,

One of them is a report of the Commission on edi­
The other is a rather full

22

broadcast licensees and members of the public of the rights

23

obligations, and responsibilities of such licensees under

24

the Commission’s fairness doctrine, which is applicable in

25

any case in which broadcast facilities are used for the
23

I

discussion of a controversial issue of public importance."

2

Now* there is included in the Fairness Primer digests

3

of several cases which involve personal attacks, and that is the

4

source, not the chronological origin, but the place where there

5

is contained in an official publication the then statement of

6

the Commission's views with respect to the particular applica­

personal-attack doctrine.

In one of the briefs in the next case, Professor Harry
Calvin is quoted.

In this article, Professor Calvin says:

"Think of a town meeting where the Chair would rule
that each speaker must be fair to both sides.”
Now, I like the town meeting analogy.

I have taken

15

part in a good many of them and they are a remarkable example

10

of democracy in action.

But I think that Professor Calvin has

17

misapplied the analogy.

He has misapprehended the function and

18

the opportunity and the responsibility of the moderator.

Let me put it this way:
