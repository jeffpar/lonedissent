ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES MORGAN, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

7

MR. MORGAN:

8

We are back today in a matter of

9

great gravity on the start of a new era in national life even

10

though it is not the beginning of another term of this Court.
The theme of the next few years is to bring us

11
12

together.

13

others, which directly relates to Section 148 of the Alabama

14

Code in both its aspects and a defendant, Judge of Probate,

15

from the State of Alabama, James Dennis Herndon.

16

We are confronted today with a question, amongst

Both the United States and counsel for Defendant

17

Herndon agree that for some reason this case is to be remanded

18

to the District Court other than for a hearing on contempt.

19

It is this Court's order that was violated, if

any,

20

by Defendant Herndon, not the order of the District Court.

21

This case is comparable to Shipp only in the sense that this

22

Court is much more clearly involved than this Court was

23
24
25

involved in Shipp.
The gravity of the case in Shipp, of course, involved
a lynching and the loss of a human life.

3

In this case, it

i

involves what we consider the theft of the right to vote.

ja

Regardless of the evidence in the case, which quite

3

clearly points, we believe — the evidence has been compiled

4

since we were last here —• which quite clearly indicates the

5

defendant Herndon is in conterapt of this Court’s order.
I would cite to you the first part of Section 148,

8

7

we challenge the constitutionality of the second part of that

8

statute, which states, in

9

The defendant received a copy of the dissolution of

10
11

the order of the lower court on the 14th.

He had his ballots

12

back by the 17th, the day on which he is required to have had

13

a name removed from the ballot, by Alabama law, and in his

14

haste, to delete the names of the Negro candidates from the

15

ballot.
He not only violated the order of this Court, but

15
17

violated the first provision of Section 148.

18

last election Alabama now has more elected Negro officials

19

than any other Southern State, 72.

Since this

/

20

Additionally, one more official has been appointed.

21

The 17 Negroes elected in this election to admittedly minor

22

posts by the NDPA equals the entire number of elected Negro

23

officials in the entire State of Florida, for instance.

24
25

There are now in the South, of the best ascertainable
techniques that we have, Negro eelected public officials.

4

1

There may be up to 400 but those are the figures of the

2

Southern Regional Council Voter Project.
During this four years, of course, we concern

3
4

ourselves in the South, all of us, no matter which side of the

5

political fence we are on, or otherwise, regarding the upcoming

6

life that we are about to live.
For a number of years in the South men have contuma­

faced with, no doubt.

Unlike

Macon County, Alabama, where

you do have a more coalesced movement for true integration and
politics, in Greene County the Probate «Judge found himself
suddenly faced with the imminent

election of four Negroes

to the five-man county commission, and two Negroes to the fiveman county board of education on which one Negro then

sat.

This is not a large county, this is a small county„
There are not a lot of

folks there.

You would think no one

politicians just get together every now and then.

never even see each other.

There is

They have all got television sets and they have got two

9

television stations that they receive clearly, one from

10

Birmingham and one from Meridian.
But the white public officials just didn't know

1!

12

anything about this, but they never campaigned for office.

13

Q

14

A

Where is this?
It is right over next to the Mississippi line.

15

The NDPA candidates were elected from three counties: Greene,

16

borders on Sumter, and Marengo, and those are two of the

17

counties where they elect officials.

And the county seat is?

A

E-u-t-a-w,, Eutaw.

4

It is a very small town, it

is a couple thousand folks, 3,000.
It is just absolutely inconceivable that on the face

5
6

of this record a deliberate, conscious decision was not made,

7

that in the light of past history my best political judgment —

[8

I can hear it now -— is to stand right now and take the

9

consequences.

They had the names put on the ballot.

10
I?

Leave those names off that ballot.
There were

1,938 straight ticket votes and the highest white candidate

12

got 1,709.

So, he was right in his judgment.

Fe would have

£

been serving with four Negro public officials on the county

governing body.

Now, this is the county where the greatest risk

occurred because this is where the NDPA had the number of

Mr. Morgan, you are now stating your submission

but this is not what the record shows, is it, as to the reasons

prompting the respondents?

Q

I

The reasons — to. give his reasons

7

Q

No, I would like to know what is in the record.

A

Of course, the only reason we have

Q

The only reason is his reason in the record.

A

Right.

He has several reasons.

He says,

first, that he has read the newspapers, he saw the order was
reinstated, he knew Something about it but he didn't know that
it applied to the local

candidates? that he didn't think he
r

was covered by court order and that none was served on him,
personally; that he wasn't represented in these proceedings
before; and that he wasn't a party defendant to these proceed­
ings; that he didn't have actual or constructive knowledge of
the orders of this Court; that he did, as he says, read some­
thing about it but he

just didn't understand it.

Now, in Alabama you don't have to be a lawyer to
be a Judge of Probate, but it just happens that Judge Herndon
is a lawyer.

It just happens that Judge Herndon was also the

Herndon in the case of Herndon versus Lee, which was the
last election case in Greene County and in Greene County in
1966 the Circuit stayed the general election.
The sheriff there, whose name is Lee, is still in
office, not by virtue of election, but by virtue of the
fact that the matter is still being stayed and there has been
no election.

The situation in which we find ourselves now is

we are right back in the same place.
For, all of a sudden, one of the parties in Herndon

versus Lee, the same James Dennis Herndon —• on the preening
of the ballot, by the way, on the Section we are talking about,

1

148, under Section 145, talking about the preening of the

%

ballot, the case of Herndon versus Lee is cited there again

5

for the proposition that up to 20 days before the election the

6

man has the right to remove his name from the ballot.

to sound consistent, but 1 don’t think that they are.

He has given varying

Perhaps they could be made

I suppose that there are issues of fact.
There are issues of fact involved in this and

3

I think it pretty well boils down, subjectively, to what did

4

he

5

do.
Depositions have been taken from everybody except —

8

we have offered affidavits of four of our candidates plus a

7

fifth person.

8

We got these on Christmas Eve and our candidates did not get

9

back home until Christmas, late Christmas.

0

We have not offered affidavits of two candidates.

We didn’t have one candidate who was ill in Chicago.

1

He is now ill down there, the chairman of the party, he was

2

not a candidate, the two board of education candidates, I think

3

one son that committed suicide or something.

4

not make that available.

We just could

We have taken depositions in the District Court,

9

I

a number of depositions and the United States has taken a

2

number of depositions, also, and they have been forwarded to

j 3

this Court

by order of the District Court.
Q

How did those depositions come to be taken?

5

Was there earlier contempt proceedings involving the District

6

Coiirt's order?

7

A

No, sir; the United States, in the District

8

Court, filed proceedings there to enjoin the white candidates

9

from assuming office.

In those proceedings, in this case, the District
Court entered an order with the consent of the defendant on
the 20th of December

enjoining them from taking office.

Both the depositions were taken at that time, and
prior to that December 20th order.
Herndon was taken.

The deposition of Defendant

He, being fully advised of his constitu­

tional rights, as I recall it, after that order was entered or
around that same time, and it was then forwarded to — and
also with the understanding in the record that it would be
sent to this Court.
Q

Mr. Morgan, is there a question of law here

whether this is our order?
A
able to say so.
Q

Well, sir, I think it would be convenient to be
I think that

is the position --

Am I correct, initially, that there was an

order of the District Court, an injunction, wasn’t there?

10

A

Yes, sir.

Q

And that, I gather, was phrased in the District

Court, was written in the District Court?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

And then that was dissolved by the Court of

Appeals?
Wo, that was dissolved by the three-judge district
court.
Q

By the three-judge district court.

And when

you came here last, we, 1 gather, before the argument, was it,
restored the Court's injunction?
A

We went in and we took the words of Mr. Justice

Stewart's order and pretty much wrote an order that way —
not a restraining order, a temporary restraining order out
of the District Court on, as I recall, September 18th.
It was then dissolved on or about October 11.

It

was dissolved on the 10th, but wasn't filed until the 11th.
We were here on the 12th.

We then came back on the 14th and

on that day, as I recall it, you restored the order -Q

We restored it after the argument?

A

Restoration of Temporary Relief.

I am not

quite sure how we titled it, but what we asked for was to have
the original order of the District Court reinstated.

Rut*

of course, the District Court, by then, had dissolved its
own order.

I

11

So what you did was you reinstated the order and

then on the 18th --

It is a very short page.

We certainly didn't spell out any of

of the order, did we?

No. "Temporary relief was restored", I think, are

the words.

9
10

Can we use the word "reinstated"?

Well, it would matter as to the contempt proceed

ing in this Court, wouldn't it?

15

A

NO.

16

0

Why?

A

Because I think the Merrimack case clearly

17
18

says that just because jurisdiction is in another court doesn't

19

mean it is also not here for contempt and the same thing is

20

true in the Shipp case.

A

Sure.

Q

And if it is the order of both, what do you

suggest?

12

1

A

Well, if it is the order of both, I would

z

suggest that as far as judicial administration is concerned,

3

this Court should speak to the question.

Q

Because I think it is in contempt of this Court.

Why, for heavens sake?

in contempt of the lower court, isn't it?
A

Surely, it would be, yes.

You could be in

contempt of both orders at the same time, but I think, techni­
cally speaking, they have dissolved their order.
I think the District Court might very well be a
proper place to gather evidence.

There are certainly cases, which make it quite

14

plain in this, the 3ame action can be in contempt

of both the

16

A

17

Now, Section 148 again has an additional sentence.

18
19

20
21

22

Oh, yes, sir.

The history of this section -Q

Just to clarify, do you say that it is that it

is just our order, period?
A

1&11, I think I have to take that position, because

I really think that is what it is.

23

Q

Why do you have to take that position?

24

A

That is what I think it is.

25

Q

If it is the order of the District Court, too,

13

j1
2

do you still insist that the order to show cause should issue
from here?

3

A

I couldn’t hear you, I am sorry, the last part.

4

Q

If it is also the order of the District Court,

5

do you still insist that the order to show cause should issue

6

here?

7

A

3

I believe that the order should issue here and the

9
10

Yes, sir.

policy reasons that I believe and disagree on show with
Solicitor General and with many others.
The reason that I think the order should issue here

11
12

is because I think that this Court sets the pace for every

13

District Court in the South, and across the land.

14

I believe that this Court should show the way.

15

Now, another sentence in Section 148 which we attack

16

the constitutionality of, and that is the last sentence that

17

says a person cannot appear under more than one party label

13

or emblem on the ballot.

19

20

Well, this sentence was added to the Alabama statute
*
which previously contained no such prohibition. In the year

21

1909 it was added by amendment following, of course, the

22

disenfranchisement of Negro voters in the South.
The primary came into existence in Alabama about

25

His name cannot appear twice.

1903.

Alabama used literacy tests, property qualifications

and we also had a grandfather clause of a type, we called it a

14

«5

<i

2

fighting grandfather clause if you fought in any war.
Just preceding that in 1892 in Alabama there was

3

great political turmoil, Rubin F. Cobb was running on the

4

Populace Ticket.

5

all over the South.

6

Coalition and

fusion was taking place

1894 you had the same, Cobb lost by 11,000 votes.

7

1894 he lost by a greater margin.

In 1896 you will recall

8

that William Jennings Bryant was nominated by two political

9

parties for President, by three, really, I think the pre-Civil

I

j

1

10
11

Republicans were with him also.
At that time, there was a dispute over who would be

12

vice president.

13

Populace nominated Tom Watson.

South,at that time somewhat different in New York and the

15

rest of the country.

bring Negro voters into its grasp, and in those elections in

18

Alabama, there was competition for the Negro vote.

problem to a number of urban Southerners and a number of Populace,

22

because*there were about 1,000 elected Negro officials in the

23

State of North Carolina in year 1896, and in that context, the
f

24

Populace party went down into destruction.

25

It resulted in a terrifying political

Now* this political movement in this State with

I

Section 148 on the ballot cannot accomplish fusion, they can­

2

not win a Democratic primary election, and the practical

3

reason they can't win a primary election is because by

4

the State’s own documents approximately one-third of the voters

5

in Alabama now are illiterate or semi-literate.
If you walk into a polling place in a primary

6
7

election, the ballots are arranged differently in each polling

8

place by alphabet.

9

mark and mark and mark.

So, consequently, you have to walk in and

These same candidates here ran once and lost and

10
11

come back and win again when they can vote a straight ticket.

12

If you cannot combine in Alabama you are not' going to be able

13

to have this party move out in an integrated effort to bring

14

forth the best candidates it can find from all political

15

parties as well as its own.

There was one that preceded that on the 14th and I
think that was the one that restored --

I thought we were talking about both.

Well,

I think we are talking about both of them, sir.

I reckon we are talking about the order of the

least gets us to one order.

important to think in terms of Williams v

Rhodes and the

problems of the administration of the law as far as the future
is concerned so that there don1thave to be later elections
cases brought on the eves of elections.
So that matters can be adjudicated long enough in
advance so that people will know what they are doing.
I just point out to you that in 1960 — we heard
a great deal of talk in this election about the electoral
college — but in 1960 had it not been for the Liberal Party
line in New York John Kennedy would not have carried New
York, and had John Kennedy not carried New York, the 15
electoral votes that went to Harry Byrd,

six from Alabama,

eight from Mississippi, and one from a defaulting Republican
elector in Oklahoma would have been sufficient then to have
thrown the election into the Rouse and then to have thrown
it also into the electoral college preceding that time.
There is no reason for the restriction that I can
find for the anti-fusion movement other than to restrict
the actions of third parties in the same manner that was
condemned in Williams v

Rhodes,

The party cannot place the names of other nominees
on the ballot, then it finds itself in deep difficulty.
In this case, of course, we find that,with respect
to the electoral vote — and, incidentally,it is quite
important with respect to that vote for the matters to be
adjudicated.
We have some very real problems here with respect
to the primary law in the State of Alabama which allows you
to have a primary if you have a 20 percent vote in any county.
In this last election the NDPA got more than 20 percent of
the votes for office county-^wide in 12 counties.
The combined vote' of electors, AIDP and NDPA electors
would have allowed an additional 12 counties to allow us to
come under the primary law and have this own party to have its
own primaries in the future.
In short, I will reserve the rest of my time and
simply say that we feel that the vindication of this Court's

18

3

order requires that the defendant to show cause why he should

2

not be held in civil or criminal contempt.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.

S

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. CLAIBORNE:

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
First,a word about a matter of contempt.

8
9

Mr. Claiborne.

Vie donM;

wish to take any absolute position with respect to that matter.

30

It seemed to us that the order of this Court,merely restoring

11

a detailed order of the District Court, and the violation of

12

the terms of the order of that District Court might be viewed

13

as well as a contempt of the District Court's order as a

14

contempt of this Court's order, perhaps of both.
If both, or if only of the District Court's order,

15

m

it would seem to us appropriate for that matter to be

17

explored more fully in the District Court, since there are,

18

admittedly* disputed questions of fact to be explored.
On one hand, Judge Herndon, as we understand it,

19
20

was served sometime back with a copy of the order of the

21

District Court of September 18th.

candidates in his county.

24
25

He was, therefore, presumably,

aware of its terms and how it applied to him and the

If he received notice that that very order which he
had already received and studied and, presumably, was ready to

19

1

effectuate, had been restored by order of this Court, he

2

needed no further notice in order to act on it.

3

It does appear, however, that he received no formal

4

communication of the action of this Court, either from clerk

5

of this Court, or from the attorneys representing Alabama

6

before the Court.

7

Why he received no notice from the Attorney General's

8

office in Alabama, is, perhaps, one of the matters that

9

deserves exploration.

to

He did,

admittedly, read some accounts of this

11

Court's action in newspapers, but we are not clear whether

12

that came home to him or not.

13

seems to us the matter is not yet ready for adjudication, that

14

the District Court is obviously a more convenient forum,

15

that, jurisdictionally, since it was the order of that court,

16

however, effective by subsequent order here, it was violated,

17

that court would have jurisdiction to explore the matter.

18

Q

Under those circumstances, it

Precisely, what sort of order do you think we

19

should enter, Mr. Claiborne, or, if we adopted that approach

20

to the problem?

21

A

Our suggestion, Your Honor, is that this Court,

22

in its judgment, among other reliefs, direct the District

23

Court to undertake such further proceedings with respe ct to the

24

matter of contempt as it deems appropriate.

25

Q

Contempt of what?

20

1

2
3
4

A

Contempt of orders issued in tie case by Judge

Herndon or others.
Q

Would that foreclose the possibility that there

was a contempt of the order of this Court or would we, in
I

5

effect, be asking the District Court to determine whether

6

there had been a contempt of the order of this Cottrt as well

7

as of the District Court?

8

A

I would suppose, Your Honor, the Court would

2

wish to leave that open, that if the proceedings in the District

10

Court indicated that any contempt, whatever, had been committed

1

sufficient to cause issuance of an order to show cause or such

2

further proceedings that might be appropriate, then the

3

District Court might refer that matter back here or might

4

proceed ahead on its own.

5

I wouldn't suppose this Court would need to foreclose

6

itself from, at a proper time, considering whether a contempt

7

on its own order had been --

I am sure you see what is bothering me is a

Your Honor is correct.

and in order to explore the factual setting a commissioner

The order to show cause issued here

I am not suggesting that the District Court stand

2
o“3

in the place of that commission, but rather that since it

4

appears that the District Court's order was violated, that

5

it might, at least initially, undertake the proceeding in its

6

own name on suggestion of this Court when jurisdi ction is

7

restored.
Q

8

What the District Court might have to do is to

9

proceed to determine whether there is a contempt of its own

10

order and without some further specification this Court, for

which I know of no precedent,

proceed to determine whether there has been a contempt of an

order of this Court.

18

maybe there is one, District

Well, I would think one would follow from

the other if the District Court should conclude that upon
further exploration either there were no cause to proceed
further in contempt, then I would think that while this Court

would be free to reexamine the matter, that would be the end

10

of it.

Not by the United States, so far as I know,

not by the plaintiffs in the case.

I think there is a very old case in something-

Is that cited in any of the briefs?

6

A

I think it is not.

The only case I remember

7

cited here is Merrimack, which, as I remember, involves

8

a Court of Appeal and

9

an order issued directly by Court of Appeal but also involving

orders of the District Court, and finally Shipp, which involved

a District Court on that which involved

only an order of this Court, not even an order of the District

I

There will be procedural tangles, won’t there?

2

Ordinarily, I take it, if we issue an order to show cause and

3

ask the District Court to take testimony on any factual

controversy, I gather its conclusions as to fact would be

subject to exceptions as in the case of any masters report?

I may have muddied our own suggestion, Your

Honor.

with respect to the matter of contempt except to leave the

District Court free to proceed on the theory of pro tanto,at

It really was that this Court take no action itself

Should

the District Court proceed if it

12

determines that there was a contempt on its orders in a con­

13

tempt proceeding in that court for contempt of that order

14

and let alone any questions that concern a contempt of any

15

order of this Court.
A

16
17

I think so.

I dare say that the implication

of a provision in mandate of this Court expressly leaving the

18

District Court free of proceeding in contempt would carry

19

the

21

23
24
25

implication that this Court, at least, tentatively

so be it restored here rather than an original matter here.
Q

Well, the District Court quite appropriately

should take no action, whatever, under your formula.
A

Well, I should think that if the District

Court took no action whatever on the ground that its own order

24

1

! a
3

had expired and was no longer a viable court order which
could be violated then this Court would have to examine the
matter.
If, however, it took no action because it sounds

4
! 5

from the facts already before it or then before it that there

6

was no cause to proceed further, being no sufficient indication

7

of criminal contempt, I would justify those proceedings.
This Court might, likewise, let the matter rest.

8
9
10

I am not suggesting which outcome is more likely or more
appropriate.
If I may, I would like to turn to the merits because

11
12

really United States has participated here with a view to

13

speak

14

to the merits rather than to the matter of contempt.
As we see this case, it does involve a serious
l

IS

abridgment of the rights of Negro citizens of Alabama to fully

16

participate in the political process, and that comes at a

17
18

time when they are registered to vote.
The question is whether they shall be permitted to

19

cast their ballots for the candidate of their choice.

20

seems this effort, like previous efforts, must be condemned

21

and that is so even if one does not assume that this is a

22

deliberate discrimination on account of race, even though in

23

light of history, ancient history and recent history, it is

24

difficult to indulge in that assumption.

25

It

What its stake is here, or its three rights, the
25

t

right of persons to associate together for political purposes

?.

to form an effective party, in this case, something of a

3

splinter party from the Democratic Party.

4

There is also the rights of the candidates themselves,

5

the specific candidates involved here,to run for political

6

office, that is to be on the ballot.

7

Finally, and perhaps most important, the rights of

8

a group of citizens, here, as it happens, a majority of the

9

citizens in these counties, to vote for, to select, cast

!0
11

their votes for the candidate of their choice.
If they are not permitted to do that., as in Greene

12

County, if they have only one slate, they are effectively

13

disenfranchised.

14

candidates.

15

their votes for all practical purposes are defeated.

16

Now, that was done in this case.

They don't want to vote for these other

Their own candidates are taken off the ballot and

There were 67

17

candidates to begin with, that is local candidates, I am

18

only speaking of local candidates because candidates for

19

Presidential-elect, for national office, for State-wide office

20

were defeated.

21

Therefore, it seems to us, as a practical matter,

22

perhaps, legal matter, the cases lie only with respect to the

23

local candidates and then only with respect to those 23 of

24

them who prevailed or would have prevailed, 23 out of 67,

25

approximately one-third prevailed or would have prevailed.

26

i

Seventeen of those were, in fact, elected in three

2

counties:

3

elected, however, to very minor posts:

4

Constable and, in one case, chairman of the Board of Education.

5

Marengo, Autauga and Surnter Counties.

They were

Justice of the Peace,

There was more at stake in Greene County.

Four

6

seats on the five-man board of commissioners,which governs

7

the county were up for election, and they were NDPA candidates

8

for each of those four posts.

9

clear they would have prevailed had they been on the ballot.

The statistics make it perfectly

10

Also, there were two seats on the five-man board

11

of education, and Mr. Morgan pointed out the local head of

12

this party was already sitting on the board of education and

13

they were now two more seats up and again the Negro candidates

14

from all that appears would have prevailed for those seats.

15
16
17

Q

Now, what do you mean by that?

How can you

assert that?
A

The way we judge the actual votes cast for the

18

white candidates were, at the best, taking the one with the

19

highest number, as I remember, 1,709, the number of straight

20

party votes for the NDPA ticket, which was officially reported

21

to the District Court on its order, was something like 1,938.

22

Those votes, straight party votes, for the NDPA

23

ticket would, of course,have counted for the local candidates,

24

had they been on the ballot.

25

if one looks at the sample ballots we have in the back of our

This is rather clearly seen

27

bx'ief, the first one being the one used for all except
>

absentee voters, the second being the one used for absentee

3

voters which includes the six local candidates.

4

Now, the general impression one gets from reading

5

what there is of the record, in this case, is at best, one

6

wonders whether it is entirely an accident that

7

was most at stake, somehow, these candidates didn't appear

8

on the ballot.

where there

9

Then one has a strong impression that there has

0

been a tremendous amount of vacillation; the Secretary of

II

State said she would certify these people, then she wouldn't,

12

then she would, finally, she didn't.

13

The reasons given vary, from time to time.

The

14

final and only serious reason that was ultimately given was

5

given only after this law suit was filed and never invoked

16

before, nor was it invoked in other counties, apparently it

7

was thought appropriate to invoke it in Greene County.

i8

The net result, in any event, is that the majority

i9

of voters in these four counties were denied an opportunity,

'0

if the judgment of the District Court prevails, to cast their

A

vote for the candidates of their choice.

2

Now, the provision most immediately involved is

13

Section 274 of the Corrupt Practices Act, which provides that

14

within five days after a person designates himself to run for

15

elective office, he must file a designation of his finance

28

|

1

committee that failure to do that, it is alleged, is the

2

reason why these candidates were kicked off the ballot in

3

Greene County and should have been kicked off the ballot,

4

according to the State, elsewhere though the Judges of Probate

5

of those other counties didn’t seem inclined to invoke this

6

provision.
It is not a very critical provision of the election

7

3

laws.

At least with respect to local office, if you look at

9

some of the appendices we filed there, you will see that these

to

candidates spent something approaching $150 in the primary

and general election campaign.

is not critical, it seems to

It is not clear when the five days start to run.

For

the white candidates five days apparently started to run from
\

the time they first announced themselves as candidates on
March 1st, but they never filed anything else.
They then filed a designation,

first

an announce-

ment in the same form they designated themselves as their
own committee, which is what the form provides for as though
it was a very pro forma operation.
Q

They all did that at that stage?

A

They all did that, white and Negro candidates.

For the white candidates that was apparently sufficient.
the Negro candidates

For

it was not; it was held that they should

have filed a second designation of themselves as their own
finance committee, if that is what they chose to do,

after they

formally submitted their nominations as candidates of this
NDPA party on September 5th.
Q

Is there any Alabama statute that requires

double filing?
A

The Alabama statute,which is reprinted in our

brief at Page 3-A, I believe, is unclear whether more than one
such designation is necessary.

It reads as follows:

"Within

five days after the announcement of his candidacy for anv
;

office each candidate" — this is for a State office — "shall

^

file with the Secretary of State, and each candidate for a

;

county office shall file with the Judge of Probate, and each

30

1

candidate for a circuit", and so forth, — "a statement showing

2

the name of not less than one nor more than five persons

3

selected to receive, expend, audit", and so forth, "money."
Nothing whatever about doing it again after the

4
3

primary.

8

applies to primaries, no suggestion that it must be done twice

7

and, indeed, the implication in this record is that it need

8

not be done twice at least when you are successful in the

9

primary.

10

It seems to be clear, as a matter of Alabama office,

Nor does this requiement say that you must announce

11

the party to which you are affiliated.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

submission

I do consider, however, that the Solicitor General

11

and his argument explored most of these avenues and I want

ia

to direct myself, if I may, to these merits.

o

I think that there is a little misconception as to

14

the facts and I would like to ask the Court to bear with me

15

just a moment.

16

17

To go back to the beginning of this entire picture,
factually, the Solicitor General makes a point, for example, in
4

18

brief, that this case has now been mooted as to the rights of

19

all persons except, one, those in Greene County who were not

20

on be ballot and who, the argument proceeds, were due to be

21

placed on the ballot.

22

Then those in three other counties, Autauga, Marengo,

23

and Sumter Counties, who were victorious, some of whom were

24

opposed to these offices, some of whom were not opposed, some

2b
33

!

of whom were the only persons on the ballot, because the status

2

of their election is affected.
Certainly, we agree with that.

3

But we don’t intend

4

to let the picture be confused for this reason: That we consi­

5

der the third point that the Solicitor General mentions in

6

brief to be the most important point as far as the State of

7

Alabama is concerned, and that is the validity of these

8

statutes: The validity of the Corrupt Practices Act, the validit •y

9

of the Garrett Act, the validity of the other statutes under

10

attack, the question of

II

subjected to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, prior to its

12

efficacy.

13

whether the Garrett Act is due to be

Those are the questions in the case.

Those are

14

the questions that gave rise to the case and that is what we

15

came here on the first time and, as far as the State of

16

Alabama is concerned, we are still here.

17

Now this is not to demean or belittle the fact that

18

this Court probably has to decide the fate of particular

19

people, that it has to decide, for example, whether there

>0

will be, perhaps, an election in Greene County or not, a new

II

election, maybe it has to decide that.

12

It is asked to.

It has to decide then, perhaps,

13

whether certain persons who were elected under the NDPA banner

14

in these three other counties are due to continue holding their

15

office, but I think it has to decide this because it has to

34

!

decide the validity of the statutes and then their application

2

to these particular persons and I make this point only to

3

say this, that the Solicitor General is in error,and I think

4

completely unwittingly, when he says that the Negro candidates,

5

as he says, the NDPA candidates because they were not all

S

Negro, there were some white and some Neqro, but the candidates

7

of the National Democratic Party of Alabama, he said, filed

8

a declaration of intent and

9

before March 1, 1968 and that then he says the white candidates,

a designation of committee on or

10

I presume by that he means the candidates of the Regular

11

Democratic Party of Alabama for nomination in this primary,

12

filed such a statement.

13

Then he said that the law is so unequally applied,

14

or, at least, I understand him to say this, that the lav/ is

15

so unequally applied in Alabama that such a filing was held

16

to be good for all time as far as what he called the white

17

candidates were concerned, and not good so far as what he

18

called the Negro candidates.

19

So we ---

20

Q

The District Court just upheld the law.

2

A

The District Court found that the statutes

attack, one, were not unconstitutional on their face, two,

4

were not shown to have been unconstitutionally applied, and

5

three, ihe holding was that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was

6

not imFolved.
Now, this, as I understand it, is the decree that

7

was appealed from.

It said one other thing in the decree and

9

that is it was not then going into details.

with 123 people to start with, not the 67 that counsel speaks

of.

13

of State law and we are not going into the detail of it.

point is that the record in this case will reflect that

17

counsel's statement was wrong with reference to the 67,

approximately, of the NDPA candidates who survived the original

agreement that they weren't qualified, and this was done by

letters of counsel.

23

25

The Court is familiar with that.

This was done by letters of

It certainly is true that some NDPA candidates
filed declarations of intent prior to March 1 and that they
filed on the same form that was used by other candidates, and
36

i

i

that that declaration of intent contained a desicmation of

2

committee and designated themselves as counsel pointed out.
Now, some did and

3

some did not.

With reference

4

to the six people in Greene County who were left off the ballot,

5

my understanding is, and I believe that these are the facts,

6

that all six of those individuals had qualified as candidates

7

in the Democratic primary of the Regular Democratic Party of

8

Alabama which was held on May 7, 1968, that in the primary,

9

there were two candidates for each of the positions.
One, the NDPA candidate, of these six, the other

10
11

the candidate of the Regular Democratic Party of Alabama.

12

So, it was a two-man race, as I understand it, in'each one of

13

these.

14

They filed identical papers.

There is no question

15

about that as far as I

ballot of the Democratic primary.

Now, each of these six was defeated in the Democratic

19

primary and, though I am not trying to contempt the case, I do

20

point out, as we noted in the brief, that this is an unrestricted

21

primary, that everyone is allowed to vote in it, it is not a

22

closed primary; counsel, in his brief, called Alabama a no­

23

party State when it comes to holding its primary.

24

So, I don't make any brief for the fact of who would

a very good point.

Let me illuminate it just a little bit.

I7

I think it raises a substantial question

They did

file those papers identifying themselves, and the law allows
it

to be done in this fashion, as a candidate of or a candidate

18

seeking the nomination of the Democratic Party, for a particular

19

position in the primary.

20

Now, what they are maintaining is this, that on the

l\

same day that that election was held — the primary election

IZ

was held — that the National Democratic Party of Alabama in

»3

that county also conducted a mass meeting on the same date

14

because this is a method by which political parties can nominate

►5

in Alabama.

But they conducted a mass meeting and I would be
38

1

frank to admit that I have learned in this case that a mass

2

meeting can be two or more, but that is not a part of the

3

issue hare.

4

That issue was resolved unfavorably to the position

S

the appellees in the District Court and the point on which

6

decision was made and we are not raising it here.

7

They represent that on that same day they were

8

nominated by the National Democratic Party of Alabama for the

9

same offices in a mass meeting.

What is said now to the

JO

Court is that the declarations of intent, the designation of

1?

committee, that they made for the handling of their finances

12

for this primary in which they were eliminated and which for

13

all that appears they were no longer a candidate because nobody

14

knew of the candidacy of these people, these candidates and

15

other candidates of the party,until about September 5

16

I think that the Court will recall that the record shows very

17
18

and

clearly that the certificationsof nomination descended from
Huntsville, Alabama simultaneously by registered or certified

19

mail on the various probate offices in the six or seven countie =i

20

of Alabama and in the office of the Secretary of State of the

2!

State of Alabama.

22

Now, I don't know and I say to the Court I think
it has not been ruled on in Alabama where the designation of
committee under

the Corrupt Practices Act may in a situation

in which a party individual does identify himself as a

I don't know the answer to that.

persons who were on the ballot twice lost, as far as I know,

I am not aware of any instances in which they won both

offices, as far as that was concerned.

But what I am saying, merely is this, if this Court

rules, for example, that whatever was done by six people from

Greene County,in order to become candidates in the Democratic

8

primary in the spring of 1968, constituted an adequate com­

Practices Act.
It is not a basis for holding the statute, invalid

or inconstitutional.

13

We are not pushing the situation of a particular candidate.

14

What I am saying is that I recognise that there is a substan­

tial question raised here and one that has not been resolved

16

by Alabama law, that we have persons who filled out these

17

forms.

18

Q

This is the State of Alabama's interest.

Mr. Redden, I take it that your argument,

19

thus far, is to only one branch of the submission of your

20

adversary on this point.

21

, -

The other branch of their argument, as I understand

22

it, is reflected in Judge Johnson's dissent in which he

23

says, as I recall, that the law has been discriminatorily

24

applied here.

25

That is to say that it has not been applied

in the past and that for, whatever reasons, the State election

43

officials chose to apply that provision of the Corrupt
i

Practices Act, in this case, to the people, and, what I would like
to know is
and I don't recall — V/hat, if anything, is therJ
in the record to support the proposition that the law was
discriminatorily applied; that is to say, that these instances
were selected for the

The record contains very little in

a substantial way and I will give the Court my recollection
of it.
The most populous county in Alabama is Jefferson
County, where Birmingham is.
a million population.

It has approximately 3/4 of

The Probate Judge of that county, Judge

J. Paul Meeks, testified by deposition in the case, and he
testified that there were approximately 2,000 compliances
with the Corrupt Practices Act filed in his office alone in
connection with the spring elections and nominations in
Jefferson County.
That would be the compliances for local offices,
and that everybody files them, that it is checked, which is a
requirement before he will certify a nominee.
The only ether testimony that I think is — well,

i 1

lefc me resolve that — Mr.

Amos, the Secretary of State,

testified that these are uniformly filed in her office and

3

Now, Dr. Cashin, who was the State Chairman of the

4
5

National Democratic Party of Alabama, testified that his

6

party was aware of the existence, both of the Garrett Act

7

and of the Corrupt

14

requirements of the Garrett Act and the designation of

these, being disqualified in an Alabama election for failure

I understand that.

any such record?
A

Yes, sir.

We have three or four reported cases,
45

ail of which are cited in brief and we have a couple of

2

opinions of the Attorney General of Alabama, which resulted

3

from this type of thing and, of course, this has led to

uniform holding of cases that the provisions of this Act are

The United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circui:

10

touches on the question of enforcement or use does not support

opinion as binding.

13

it is a crippling thing to this position that Judge Johnson

14

found was that most of the time that it has been enforced, it

15

was not done by the State at its own motion.

I think the cases do.

Now, I don't think

Well, I think it normally is true that the people

who really keep in these political

campaigns are going to be

18

adversaries.

19

I don't think it is desparaging to the law, or to the enforce­

20

ment of the law, to say that a private party often has brought

21

the litigation, but the law has been enforced, and it has been

22

the law for 54 years, since 1915, almost essentially without

23

change.

24
25

I mean, that they certainly are going back faster.

But we make the point again that of course we have
come down now, because of the fact that the election has been

46

1

held, we have come to the point where of those who remain,

2

the winners and those who were left off the ballot, we would

I 3

4

say that perhaps some did and some did not execute these
documents.
As to the Greene County people, I think that someone,

S
S

whether it is this Court or the United States District Court,

7

for the proceedings this this Court might order, has a substan­

3

tial question to decide, whether under this valid law, the

9

Corrupt Practices Act, that what was done for the purposes

10

of entering the Democratic primary, would suffice as a designa­

11

tion of campaign ccmmittee, to receive contributions, fer any

12

other race that that candidate might have made during that

13

same year.

Q

What is the

Alabama law with respect to a man

15

who gets on the ballot, is elected, and then his election is

IS

attacked on the ground that he failed to comply with the

17

Corrupt Practices Act?

18

A

The failure to comply with reference to this

19

portion of it would be held where the issue was first raised

20

after the election, not to void the election --

21

Q

Not to void the election.

22

A

-- as I read the cases.

Of course,A . I do make

23

this point, that though we are standing now subsequent to the

24

election we have been disputing with this issue since

25

September of 1968 prior to the election and that period is
47

1
2

held mandatory.
Now, I think that there are some other provisions

3

of the Corrupt Practices Act that would affect the ability

4

to hold office after the election, but I don't make that

5

point here because they are not involved.

6

We keep returning to this point.

We are here

7

to uphold the validity of these statutes.

a

record shows that they have not been unconstitutionally applied

piece of legislation was enacted subsequent to the Voting Rights

14

Act of 1965, that the effect of it is to require anyone who

intent by March 1 of the election year.

17

This Court is aware, from

I would like to emphasize,at this minute,the full

18

picture with reference to the right or ability of people and

19

political parties to get on the ballot in Alabama.

20

we have got a situation that is exactly the reverse of

21

Williams v Rhodes.

22

I think

The point is made by the Court there that it is impos­

23

sible or very difficult for a new party or small party or new

24

large party to get on the ballot in Ohio, that no provision was

25

made for write-in candidacies and that independent candidacies
48

l

1

were almost unknown under the law of Ohio.
In Alabama an independent candidate for a local

2

position can get on the ballot by having a petition signed

4

by 25 names, by 25 voters,

votes.

Wow, the Court reviewed in Williams against Rhodes

Ours is minimum, fractional, or if a political
party, that party can nominate by primary, or by mass meeting
or caucus as it is called.
Q

I interrupt you long enough,Mr. Redden, to ask,

I gather that our cases that say if a party nominates by

13

mass meeting, this requirement of designation — what is it —

14

within five days after what?

15

A

Announcement of candidacy.

16

Q

So if you have a mass meeting on May 7, or

17

whatever this date is, that the announcement doesn't come until

18

September, then there is five days within the announcement

19

in September; is that it?

20

A

That would very likely be true, because unless

21

they did something that would amount, in the contemplation

22

of the law, to an announcement of this candidacy, I would think

23
24
25

that where there is no report of the mass meeting, that it
is held, that it is held privately, it is not reported and
that there is no activity, which would amount in substance to
49

i

z

an announcement of candidacy.
In other words, if I am running for sheriff, I

3

may announce it

4

to some formal announcement.

5

Q

by virtue of my campaign activity as opposed

In other words, well, then there is no require­

6

ment of a formal announcement, that you must file something

7

with someone that you are a candidate for this office, nominated

6

at a mass meeting.

9

A

Yes, sir.

There is that requirement.

The

10

law simply fixes the dead-end or far end of time within which

11

it must be done which is at least

12

That is the lav; for the elections and it is 55 days prior

13

to primary elections, it is the same sort of thing.

14

60 days prior to the election.

But that it must bedone by that far end.

That is

15

when the certification must be made.

16

In other words, what you would, say, happen in some of these

17

cases where nomination was by mass meeting occurring May 7,

18

1968, that nothing was said about it until September the 5th

19

when a certification of nomination was sent either to the

20

Probate office or to the Secretary of State’s office depending

21

on whether it was a State or local office.

22

That is the last date.

Now, also, the law allows that candidates may be

23

nominated by conventions where the delegates to the convention

24

also are chosen in these caucuses held on May 7.

25

words, the origin of nomination has to be on May 7 or the
50

In other

1

party may hold a primary.
Now, ofthe requirements of the law, the most

2
3

stringent in Alabama, far and away, are the primary.

A

4

political party nominating by caucus or mass meeting has no

5

fixed format to follow.
The law says that si.mply it be held on that day,

6
7

that is the primary election day and at or in the immediate

3

vicinity of a polling place, in a hall, room or open space,
I believe it says.

That is it.

It does say that the report of the nominations

10

U

must be signed, I believe, by the chairman presiding at

12

the meeting and the secretary of the meeting, which was not

13

done in a great many of these cases, but no one undertook to

14

disqualify anybody for failure to do that.
So, that the primary

stringent.

17

requirements to meet.

who,' nevertheless, is to be on the ballot

as a candidate of

another party, whether he has to make a second designation is
something that hasn't been decided, yet.
A

Or conceivably as an independent candidate,

had he moved.
Q

But that issue has not yet been decided, I think

you told us.
A

No, sir.

It has not.

Q

Mr. Redden, what is your answer to the

Government's Voting Right Act that you argue?
A

We take the position that, in the first place,

the District Court finding is correct.

I think that --

Q

That is a question of law, of course.

A

Yes, sir.

Of course, this Court has, I assume,under considera­
tion at this time the three Mississippi cases and I am not
aware of any decision that has come out on that yet.

I think

that Article 3, for example, if I could spend just a moment
comparing them with our case, and I may get the names mixed
up with the facts, but in oneof these cases, as I recall,the
Mississippi law was changed to make an elective office an
appointed office, the Office of Superintendent of Education in
53

11 counties in Mississippi.
This, I can't equate on the facts with this case,
and

another election was changed from a district election of

Board of County Commission,or some similar office, to an
at-large.
But, in one case, and this is the Whitley against
Williams, you had a statute which did four things, one of
which, only one of which, is what the Garrett Act does.
This statute established a rule that no person who had voted
in a primary election could run as an independent candidate
in a general election.
Q

This, of course, is not part of Alabama law?

A

They regard independents candidates to qualify

to run in the general election as the same kind as candidates
must qualify to run in the primary

election.

Now, this the Garrett Act almost does, but not quite.
The Garrett Act requires that he declare his intent to be a
candidate.

Now, whatever acts a qualification or selection

by petition may be involved; it does not require him to do that
I think that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is 15th
Amendment oriented throughout.

X think that justified every

section of the Act with the possible exception of Section 1973c
makes specific reference to the 15th Amendment and it protects
the 15th Amendment rights.
Of course, that section is applied only in locales

54

5

where it has been found that those rights have been violated

2

and that there has been a finding through the process and

established that there will be examiners and that other things

4

will take place provided for in there.

5

Now, 1 say,in that context, that you can't find
*
\

6

or justify a finding that the Garrett Act, which does only

7

one thing, and that is it gives everybody who desires to be

8

a candidate for an office, the same starting time to do

9

one thing, that is not to become the nominee, but it is to

only

10

declare his intent to become a candidate, and to freeze into

11

place, in effect, then, that for, at least, that election

IE

period.
But it creates or systematizes law that has existed

13
14

for a long time and is not a black versus white proposition.

15

Ninety-five percent of the people who run for public office

IS

have had to comply with that since about — that time schedule

17

since about 1945 — I forget when the requirements were first

18

put in.

Maybe it was a little earlier than that.
This merely systematizes a system which itself is

19

20

very liberal.

It resulted in seven parties being on the ballot

21

in Alabama this last election plus a column for independents

2Z

plus a column for write-in’s.
To such an extent that the complaint is made here

23
24

that the ballot is too confusing because it is easy to get

25

on it.

We maintain that the District Court was right in its
55

I!

decision that the Voting Rights Act does not govern.
Of course, we recognize that if this Court ordered
to the contrary; it would not be a ruling that the Act was invalid;
it would have the effect of suspending its application for
a period of time until its validity could be determined.

We

understand that.
But we do press the point that the District Court
was right.

I don’t know of any other decisions other than

these four plus the Trussell case.
On this point, and in related cases, and I think
that in all of them, with that one exception, are to the effect
that it did not apply.
I would like to make only a few other points with
reference to other statutes.

I assume that counsel for

the appellants will argue the provisions of Title 17 Section
125 of the Code of Alabama in which he says that the constitu­
tional rights are being deprived appellants because they are
not allowed to select officials for the polling places.
Well, there are six polling
polling place.

officials at each

This law that is under attack provides that

where two or more lists of suggested polling officials are
submitted by political parties, that the list submitted by
the two parties receiving the highest number of votes in the
last election will be used to

appoint the voting officials.

They will come from those two parties.
56

1

Maybe this is moot as to last election.

But, I

2

would agree that if something like this — if an attach on a

3

statute like this could have the effect, of voiding the election;

4

then somebody should say whether

5

whether it is valid or invalid.

6

it is constitutional or not,
' '

Counsel says we wouldn't want to be back next time-

7

with reference to it.

8

we had seven parties, we have six polling officials at the

9

10
11

I simply point out that not everybody —

/oting place, well, from the beginning, somebody had to be
eliminated, somebody couldn't have one.
But, secondly, everyone can have a representative.

12

The statute which we cite in the appendix to our brief points

13

out that every candidate, every party, is entitled to a watcher

14

who has rightful access to the polls, to stand there to observe

15

the operation and not only that, to be present when the votes

16

are counted, the right to observe the count of the votes, the

17

right to see the ballot, the right to observe the tabulation.

18
19

We say that this is probably the weakest argument,
actually, that they make.

10

Q

Can I go back a moment ---

satisfy the requirement for a losing candidate

Was that issue raised in the District Court at all?
Was the claim made that those previous filings did satisfy
all of the requirements?

I don't think; so.

And just said that it had been — in its appli­

cation in these circumstances, it had been discriminatorily

11

was the first time in history that the law had been invoked

12

by the Secretary of State.

13
14
15

16
17

He said that this is the first time that the law had
ever been invoked by the Secretary of State sua sponte.
Is that true, or is that contrary to the testimony
of the Secretary of State?
A

I think that you would have to say that the

18

only answer probably that the testimony gives to that is a

19

general answer.

20

Secretary of State said here are cases in which I have refused

of my own motion to accept.

Did she also say that she had, at tine,

I think that she also said that she had at one
time indicated that they would be accepted.
Q

Well, how does that fit in with the fact

that she never does it?
A

That she never did do it?

Well, the only thing that I --

This ground of disqualification as an after­

Well let me just remind you the time frame of it.

The disqualifications

could only come after the certification

was made and most of these nominations were said to have
occurred on May the 7th of 1968, some on July 20th, where
nomination was by a convention.
None of the certifications were made until
September 10th of 1968.
Q

Most of the filings would have had to have been

with the Probate Judge, anyway, wouldn't they?
A

Yec — pardon me, I had the date wrong,

September 5th of 1968.

This was true whether the filing was

60

1

with

the Secretary of State or with the Probate Judge.

2

Ninety percent, or more, of the filings were with

3

Probate Judges, who will say nothing, as far as that was

4

concerned.

5

Probate Judges had not done anything except receive by mail

6

certificates.

7

8

Of course, we made the point in brief, that the

Now, by September 10th she had acted and she had
declined to accept.

9

Q

That is only as to the State-wide officers?

10

A

As to State-wide officers.

11

Q

Now, do we have any evidence at all as to what

12

happened as to local officers which, I gather, any action

13

such as she took, not accepting after September 10, would have

14

had to have been taken by the Probate Judges, as to local

15

officers; is that correct?

16
17
18
19

A

That is correct, but what, in the development

of this case, and in order to expedite its presentation, let
me relate to you how it happened.
What you are confronted with first is a list of

»0

prospective candidates which, I believe, was in approximately

11

24, at that time, of Alabama’s 67 count for local office.

12

Then, the court, by order,and required that the

13

14
»5

parties communicate and that any grounds of disqualifications
of any of those locals be communicated in writing, transmitted
back and forth between the parties.

As a result of that, all of the candidates in
southern counties were eliminated.

I think we came down

to 17 counties in which there were candidates for local office,
when I say all the candidates, of course, there were State­
wide candidates who remain throughout.
But, these disqualifications were based on every

statement of actual disqualification.

Now, as to other candidates, t as to which there was
some disqualification that the parties agreed on that these

We came down to 67 candidates in

Now, as to that number, as to that 67, the great

majority did not file the declaration of intent required

office in Montgomery.
I didn't do anything.

Mr. Bolt called me on

Friday or Saturday of that week and asked me if I knew of
the order and I told that him that I had received this and
whatever other knowledge I had, and he asked me whether the

65

people who would be involved knew of it and I told him that

I had not dona anything.
He asked me if I would object to a letter being

I told him I didn't have any objection.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:
MR. REDDEN:

Mr. Redden.

I was making a response to a ouestion

Mr. Justice Fortas asked and T had almost completed it.

T

will continue with that, if I may.
I talked to Mr. Rookout, the Deputy Attorney General
who, I believe on two occasions, and he did some checking
apparently with the office of the Secretary of State, and
the message came back to this effect that all knew or all
had been advised but I had come to learn that the basis
of this probably was that the Secretary

of State advised that

the only message that she had sent to the various Probate
Judges,which would be all 67 Probate Judges, not just the
few involved .in local offices, was that the message that
pursuant to the decree of the District Court, the following
persons would be certified, and that she had not ever rescinded
that message though that was a period of time within which
it could have been rescended and I believe she testified, as
a matter of fact, that she was working on a recision message
at the time she learned of the order here, which I believe she
says she recalls learning, in all probability, from the
Attorney General's office.
So, that, what had been sent to them from the
office of the Secretary of State was a message that pursuant

68

?

to the order of the District Court that the followincr names

2

would be certified.

3

order — well, I say they had received — a copy of the order

4

of the District Court, which named all of the persons.

Of course, they had received a similar

I assume that the message from the Secretary of

5

6

State did not name any but the State-wide candidates.

The

7

only other piece of information I have with reference to

8

notification of us — I didn't know this at the time — but

9

Mr. Bookout testified, when his deposition was taken, that he

10

learned of the fact that the order had been entered by this

11

Court on Saturday afternoon, the 19th of October, which would

12

have been the day that it was entered.
He was called at his home by the clerk or by a

13
14

deputy clerk in Montgomery and was given that message directly

15

and was asked to write it down, which, I believe he testified

16

he did.

17

The order was entered approximately, either 16 or

18

15 days prior to the date of the election, dependina on how

19

you would count.

20

of time with Judge Herndon's counsel.

Under the arrangement, there is a division

I would like to make just a couple of other points,

21

22

if I may.

One is this:

The Soliticor General said that he

23

considers that on the merits there has been a serious abridg­

24

ment

25

he relates three areas in which he says that this abridgment

of the right to participate in a political process and

69

resulto
One is the right of association, the other, the right
of candidates to run for office and the third, the right for
citizens to vote for the candidates of their choice.
Maybe I reiterated too often, hut our position, again,
or the position of the State of Alabama.

We are not concerned

with individual positions or individual candidates.

We are

concerned with the validity of the statutes under attack, and
also, of course, with maintaining that as to the facts of this
case that they were not unconstitutionally applied.
Now, those two determinations were made by the
District Court and we say that they are due on this record
anc on the facts to be upheld.
We maintain that this case can't be viewed solely
on the basis of whatever history of discrimination there might
have been in Alabama or in any other State in the past.
We acknowledge that through decisions of this
Court, and decisions of other places, the State has stood
convicted of particular acts that the Court has found to be
discriminatory on other occasions.
We don't maintain to this Court that that is not
true, but we do maintain that to give those an overwhelming
importance here when we have to view legislation in the context
of when it came into being, what its purposes are, and,finally,
how little burden, how little burden it imposes.

70

I think that is one thing that, of course, appellants

1
2

de-emphasize in their argument.

3

creates a tremendous burden on one who is seeking to run for

4

public office.

They tend to argue that this

5

We think that the statutes, the ballot, itself,

6

in Alabama demonstrates how easy it is to be a candidate.

7

The District Court, again, and this point has been brought

8

up earlier today, made the findings I have recited in favor

9

of appellees, and then it said that it would not determine the

10

issues of State law that were involved, having made those

11

findings.
Of course, as this Court has pointed out today,

12

13

during this argument, it had the authority to.

It was not

14

a matter of its saying that we had no authority to decide this.

15

It determined that it would not.
Now, we say,to this Court, that that order or judgment

16
17

is due to be upheld, the judgment appealed from is due to be

18

affirmed.

19

judgment that that Court, that is the District Court, make

20

those determinations of State law or that it be directed through

21

a remand from this Court to make those determinations, but as

22

a preliminary, there has to be a determination on the validity

23

of the statutes and on their application in the facts and

24

circumstances of this case.

25

At the same time it would not be improper in our

The State of Alabama is not here arguing to set

ing order was made, or received by him.
Now, it is not controverted in this case that subse­
quent to that time there was no delivery of any order.

This

is not the problem, nor do we controvert that if he had
actual knowledge of the order that he would be equally in
contempt of it, as if one had been served on him.

This is not

the problem at all.
Judge Herndon, by his response to the

motion for

rule to show cause, has asserted that he was absolutely without

75

1

knowledge of the applicability of restoration of this

a

temporary restraining order in its effect as to him and to

3

local candidates.

4

This is the factual question that would be presented.

3

Q

6

Let's see if I understand that.

On October 14

Judge Herndon ordered the Greene County ballot printed.

7

A

Yes, sir.

3

Q

That Greene County ballot was deliveredto

9

him on October 17.

10

A

Yes, sir.

Ii

Q

When did he first get notice that this Court

12

13

had entered some sort of an order in
A

I believe

probably in

the premises?
the interim.

As I recall

14

his deposition, he said that he thought he saw some memorandum

IS

in the paper or some article in the paper, on the 15th or

16

thereabouts.

17

Q

On the 15th he learned that this Court had

18

entered an order with respect to the pending controversy; is

19

that right?

20

A

Yes, sir.

21

Q

And, what did he do next?

22
23
24
25

Did he take any

steps to ascertain what was in that order?
A

So far as I know, he

took none.

Q

Did he ever receive any — does the record

show whether he ever received a communication from a State
76

1
2
3

official or fronti somebody — some other official?
A

Not only does the record say that the reflecting

communication, I don't think --

4

Q

This record, the record before us?

5

A

No, sir.

6

In this record, there is no suggestion that he

7

received a direct communication of any description from any

8

State office or officer.

9
10
11

Q

Did he testify as to what his understanding

was of the nature of the order entered by the Court?
A

Yes, sir.

It was his understanding that the

12

order had applicability to the Presidential-electors and

13

State-wide candidates.

14

Now, if Your Honor will recall, this was the primary

15

thrust of the case,at this time,apparently in the reporting

16

of it and I have since read the same articles and they are

17

susceptible to that interpretation.

18

Q

Are those articles in the record before us?

19

A

No, they were not incorporated into the copy

20

of the deposition that I had, though they were read into Judge

21

Herndon's deposition.

22

Q

23

I don't believe they are in the printed

record before us.

We have printed appendix --

24

A

No, sir, they are not.

25

Q

But they are in the printed record.

77

I mean the

I

typed record.

£

A

3

They were read into Judge Herndon's deposition.

4

Q

5

In the typed record, yes, sir.

Mr. Hubbard, did he receive the original

restraining order?

6

A

Yes, sir, he did.

7

Q

And did the story that he read in the newspaper

e

say that this Court had reinstated that very order which

9

he had a copy of?

10

A

I don't have a sufficient familiarity to say

11

with assurance whether it was done in precisely those terms.

12

Knowing now what I know about the case it certainly says

13

that there was a restoration

of the order.

14

Q

Which he already had?

15

A

Yes, sir.

..

Q

17

Do you know whether he tried to find out for

certain, one way or the other?

18

A

No, sir.

19

Now, with regard to the — there is, in the brief,

20

a suggestion with regard to constructive notice by virtue

21

of notification of the Attorney General’s office.

22

in passing, to mention that Judge Herndon was not a party,

23

I don't believe,in the original proceeding that was commenced

24

in the middle district.

25

I would like,

In

'

8

other words, there is no -— and I can understand why there may

9

have been no direct communication,

because, indeed, Judge

10

Herndon was not a defendant in the case, but merely a member

11

of the class who, admittedly, would be bound by the decree.

12

Now, the real --

13

Q

Do you agree or disagree that it was somebody's

14

duty to notify all of the Probate Judges of the order entered

15

by this Court?
A

16
17

18
19

I am sure that there is such a duty in existence,

yes, sir.
»

Q

And somehow or other that was not done; is that

your position here?

20

A

21

Q

Yes, sir.
<•

Your position is that the only notice or

22

knowledge that Judge Herndon had was the article which he

23

read in the newspaper?

24

A

Yes, sir.

25

Q

Now suppose that he had, I take it from what
79

you earlier said, that if this article had said plainly that
the candidates for local office in Greene County were required
by the order of this Court to be placed on the ballot, then
Judge Herndon would have had a duty to do so, that is to say
he would have had actual knowledge.
A

I certainly accept this, yes, if he had hatj

actual knowledge of this order that it would

have been his

duty so to do, absolutely.
Q

So that the matter as far as Judge Herndon

is concerned, regardless of what the position, if any, may
1

/

be with respect to anybody else who did not notify the
Probate Judges, so far as Judge Herndon is concerned, your
submission, than, is that this turns on a question of fact.
A

Yes,

sir.

Q

And that the record before us does not show

that he had notice or knowledge, either formal or informal?
A

Yes, sir.

Not only does it not show that he had notice, but
he, unequivocally, states in his deposition and in his response
to this Court that he did not have notice.
The more interesting question, from a legal point of
view, I believe, involves whether or not in the event this
Court should determine that a further exploration of the
question of possible contempt should be made in this case,
whether that exploration should be made in this Court or in

80

1

the United States District Court for the middle district of

2

Alabama.
It is our position that the Solicitor General has

3

4

adopted the correct recommendation to this Court and that

S

a proper investigation would be in the United States District

Court.
v

7

First, in this respect, the order which is ---

8

Q

May I ask, Mr. Hubbard --- •

9

A

Yes, sir.

JO

Q

An investigation, you mean limited to ---

11

A

If there is to be a further hearing, an

12

ascertainment, judicially, to the fact.
Q

13

But I mean an investigation by the District

14

Court on behalf of this Court or an investigation by the

15

District Court on its own?
A

16

It is our position, really, that the order

17

involved is the order of the District Court, and that if there

18

is a contempt, it is,

19

Court.

essentially, a contempt of the District

20

Q

Would

21

A

No, sir.

Q

Do you think we might ask the District Court

22
23
24
25

we have to decide that?

to determine whether there had been a contempt of its order,
and, if so, to take appropriate proceedings and we have opened
the question of whether

there should be a proceeding involving

81

1

a
3
4

any possible contempt of an order of this Court?
A

Yes, sir.

I think that is entirely possible.

I think this is entirely the correct procedure.

Q

j
Ij

You mean we shouldn't decide here, now, that

§

if there was a contempt, it was a contempt of the District

6

Court's order and maybe a contempt of this Court's order?

t

Ii

7

A

No, sir.

8

Q

Or should we leave to the District Court the

9

I don't think ---

question of whose' order */as violated if any order was?

10

A

I am sorry, I didn't hear you.

II

Q

Do you think we should leave to the District

12

Court" the question, in the first instance, of determining

13

whose order was violated if any order was violated?

14

A

No, sir.

I believe that it would be entirely

15

correct for this Court to direct that the legal

18

what was accomplished was to revitalize the order of the

17

District Court just as it would have had, if an appeal had

18

been taken and a sxipersedeas filed to preserve the order of the

19

lower court.

20

effect of

This, indeed, is the order that is involved and

21

remanded to the District Court for a determination in accordance

22

with the indications of the circumstances.

23

The question of whose order it is, is, frankly, with­

24

out precedent.

I have been unable to find any case that says --

25

that is sufficiently comparable to be an authority one way or
82

1

another in this case.
The Merrimack case, obviously, holds that one act

2
3

may be a contempt of the order of both courts.

This, however,

4

is, I believe, a different type of act

5

involved in Shipp and Shipp is, substantially, the only

6

precedent for contempts in this Court.

from that which is

7

The effect there was,of the act complained of, was

8

to completely defeat the jurisdiction of this Court so as to

9

render ineffective any judgment that it might render.
Here, obviously, this Court has the power to

HO
11

completely adjudicate this matter and give effect to its

12

order.

13

the jurisdiction of this Court, to adjudicate the controversy.

14

So this is not the type of act which would frustrate

Now, there is a second consideration.

The United

15

States District Court has, indeed, assumed jurisdiction on

IS

motion of the United States, and has, since the action has

17

been pending in this Court, issued an order enjoining the

13

effectuation of the election and has preserved the status

19

as it exists during the pendency of this, a number of deposi-

20

tions have already been taken there, that court views that

21

it still has and is exercising jurisdiction in this case.

22

quo

Finally, I would cite to the Court the expressions

23

of Mr. Justice Black in the Barnett case in which he comments

24

upon the respective functions of trial and of appellate courts

25

and points out, in some instances, the impracticality of

83

1

undertaking a factual investigation in this Court.

2

Particularly, is this true, in view of the obvious

3

necessity that if a hearing is conducted here it must be

4

conducted by and before a commissioner not as a proceeding

5

for this Court.

6

If the Federal rules which give credence and

7

presumptions favorable to the findings of trial judges on

8

evidence taken orally before them has a basis then the trying

9

of

a case before the judges on oral testimony is more apt

10

to result in a correct result than would perhaps be accomplished

11

by a hearing before a commissioner.

12

There are other arguments that could be advanced.

13

However, by way of summary, let me say, that insofar as the

14

factual issue is concerned, it is our sincere position that

15

Judge Herndon’s ignorance of the order of this Court is merely

16

an unfortuante breakdown in communications and that he failed

17

genuinely to receive notice or knowledge of that order.

-

The history of the man, I believe, shows that had

18
19

he had notice of it, that he, indeed, would have complied with

iO

it;

11

Q

Does that show in the record?

!2

Does the history of that man show in rhe record?

!3

A

The history with regard to the May 5th primary

A

and with regard to the absentee ballots show in the record,

:5

yes.

84

Q

Shows what?

A

Shows that on the May 5th primary in Alabama,

each of the NDPA candidates was placed on the ballot

for

the same office.
Q

Well, nobody disputed their right at that time,

A

No, sir.

Q

Well, that is a little different from October.

A

And, of course, in October when someone did

did they?
!

dispute the right when the absentee ballot was printed during
the

effectiveness of the District Court order the name did

appear on the absentee ballot.
Q

But you say that the whole reason for his

ignorance of the order was somebody else's and I say I think
you are admitting the fact that he could have found out himself.
After all, he was a lawyer.
A

With regard to that, if I may, while Judge

Herndon graduated from law school some 10 or 15 years ago, he
has never practiced law.

He was employed by a corporation,

not as a lawyer.
Q

Mr. Hubbard, before you sit down, may I ask you,

I suppose that the test as to whether we should issue the order
to show cause, which is the only thing that is before us in this
branch of the case, is whether there has been a prima facie
showing of contempt; would you agree?
85

5

A

Yes, sir.

I have tried to find some case

2

which defines the propriety of issuing a rule to show cause

3

and I have been unable to locate one.

4

Q

Yes,

5

A

But from a legal point of view, I think this

6

does not consider the fact as to the proper forum for the

7

investigation.

8
9

Q

But let's say that we are satisfied as to

questions of the law, then on the factual side I suppose a

10

showing has to be made to us as to prima facie case of probable

11

cause or something like that; isn't it?

12

A

Yes.

13

Q

Less than a conviction on our part.

14

A

Surely.

IS

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES MORGAN, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

19

MR. MORGAN:

May

it please the Court to go directly

to the question of Judge Herndon's notice, I would like to
' s

20

cite to you the deposition which is here in this Court of

>1

Judge Herndon's.

22
23

Judge Herndon testified elsewhere, other than Page 60
at which I now am, that he --

24

0

Are you talking about the typewritten record?

25

A

Yes, sir.
86

i

1

Q

It is not in the printed appendix?

2

A

There is no printed record and the appendix

3

to the government and us contain only sundry references and

4

we are allowed to proceed forward without a printed record.

5

I have asked the clerk if we should file a printed record and

6

they say, no, not at this stage, at least.
So we refer throughout briefs,and also here, to

7
8

depositions which have been filed by the Court after motion
being filed below, therefore.

In the Herndon deposition, it is quite clear that

11

he does subscribe to two newspapers.

12

of these candidates, who admitted that he read them.

13

The Tuscaloosa News is one.

Fe is the only person,

The Birmingham Post

14

Herald is another, and he could have read either one of them.

15

Mr. Dunball at the Department of Justice at Page 61 reads to

16

him from the article and it states explicitly this:

(53

On the next page the Tuscaloosa News article says

3

approximately the same thing.

4

and find that the Greene County Democrat, the official organ

S

in which Judge Herndon, as Probate Judge, advertises for

6

the county, contains an article.

We could move further than that

i

Now, in that case it is very strange because the

7
0

very man that printed the article, the publisher and editor

0

of the paper, said he didn't read it either.

A

question

10

came up earlier about, the record, from Justice White with

11

respect to whether or not these matters were in issue as to the

12

application of the Corrupt Practices Act in the lower court.

j -13

On Page 55-A of the Amicus Curiae, United States

14

brief herein, you will find representations made by the State

IS

in their answer below regarding the disqualification of all

16

candidates from Greene County and referring thereto to some

17

attached

exhibits, J, K and L.
Those exhibits

18

are found in the record of this

19

Court,again not printed, Exhibit J, Page 307,

an affidavit

20

from Judge James Dennis Herndon in Greene County.
He lists the names of the NDPA candidates who were

21

22

left off the ballot and at the conclusion of that affidavit

23

he states:

24

offered to file in my office the name or names of persons

25

"None of the six above-named candidates filed or

If you, then, return to the briefs of the United

4
5

States, you will find there as Appendix E, Page 60-A, a qv.ali.fi

6

cation blank of the type that has been filed with this Court,

7

which was filed by these candidates in the Democratic primary

8

election.
With respect to the Corrupt Practices Act, these

9
10

six candidates, before March 1st, 1968, stated, on Page 61:

11

"I, hereby, certify and declare that I appoint myself and,

12

hereby, accept the appointment as the sole and only person

13

or committee to receive, expend, audit and disburse all moneys",

14

et cetera.

15

Now, there are several questions about the case to

16

one unfamiliar

17

particularly about Mr. Justice White's comments regarding

18

the Ohio primary election and its effective winnowing down

19

of candidacies and its good effect, in that sense, and, certain

20

the State has an interest in doing so.

21

with

Alabama politics and I am thinking now

The State here makes no point that it was improper

22

for any of these people to run in the Democratic primary

23

election and,at the same time,to receive the nominations at

24

a mass meeting.

25

As a matter of fact, on Page 22 of their brief, they

89

concede that it is not improper.

Surely it is not improper

because they have learned from history in Alabama, they
learned from the election in Macon County where Sheriff Lucias
Amos ran against three white opponents in 1966.

Pe got around,

after winning the primary election there, at the end of 1966
one of his white candidates had a write-in campaign and the
other appeared on the ballot under Third Party for America, Inc
The same thing happened in Selma, Alabama.

After

Jim Clark lost in the primary, he ran again in the general
elections.

Some question has been raised here about mootness.
Q

Mr. Morgan, I would suppose the District Court,

the three-judge court, either decided that under Alabama law
a filing for the primary satisfies your requirement for filing
for an independent party or didn't decide it?
A

It did not decide it.

Now which?

Now, our problem there

is-Q

Why didn't they decide it?

A

Well, we —-

Q

I would suppose that if you would have made it

an issue, they would have been required, or at least they
should have decided this issue of Alabama law.
A

Well, they didn't decide any, as they say in

the opinion, complex factual issues involved.
Q

That is not a factual issue, is it?

A

Well, with respect to whether they filed it or
90

i

1

not would have been.

2

Now, quite, frankly, we relied — what we did --

3

Q

4

on the face.

5
3

Your main thrust was that unconstitutionality

A

Of the Garrett law, certainly, or its illegality,

its non-applicability under Section 5.

7

Q

Let’s assume that the Alabama courts construed

a

this statute to mean that the filing for

9

satisfied by the requirement for filing for a candidate who

the primary is not

10

has been nominated at a mass meeting of another party.

11

assume that is what was decided.

12

then?
A

13

Let's

What vrould be your position

My position at that point would be that there

14

is nothing in the statement filed — first of all, these

15

forms were obtained in the office of the Judge of Probate.

16

They were provided to them by Judge Herndon.

17

the forms.

18

do not specify in the Corrupt Practices part of the form

19

that they are merely running

20

21

He gave them

Now, they are Democratic pai*ty forms.

But they

in the Democratic primary.

Now, the form is the form is the form.

It simply

says what it says.

22

Q

So, what would you say?

23

A

I would say that they filed.

24

Q

Well, I know, but what if the Alabama court

25

said that they hadn’t filed.

They must make another filing
91

when they ran on behalf of another party.
A

I would say then that by September 5th, when

they finally filed, the statutory period began to run.

The

Secretary of State had, until a letter was written postmarked
on the night of the 10th would have complied.
She told the statutory period to begin with, the
law dees not require you to do a useless act of course -Q

What about the local candidates?

A

With Probate Judges?

I think she spoke for

the Probate Judges and I think, certainly, in the case of these
six, Judge Herndon has shown by past acts -Q

Well, how can she speak for the local judges

when they are the ones that have to make the certifications?
A

Well, in the record we find the Probate Judges

do contact Mrs. Amos, and we do set out in brief, almost in
full, a letter from a Probate Judge saying:

"I don't think

this is worth the paper it is written on, and I am going to
contact Mrs. Amos about this."
I think that pretty well clearson the record that
everybody down there sort of works together in matters like
this.
Q

But it is not clear in the laws of Alabama,

A

I beg your pardon?

Q

The law of Alabama says specifically, does it

is it?

9?

I

not, that State go to the Secretary and local go to the Probate

2

Judge?

3

A

Yes.

4

Q

Well, are you going to put practice over the

quite often.
Q

Well, don’t we have to follow the construction

of the laws of Alabama as well as we do any other State?

II

t
Herndon versus Lee — you asked the question ago about what

12

kind of man is this man as shown in the record.

13

A

Yes, sir.

I suggest that there is an excellent series of

14

cases arising out of Greene County to judge this man.

has been a party in a number of cases.

So far as I am concerned, I love to hear you

discuss this case and

2

A

Judge Herndon's actions in this case.

All right.

In this case — the case of Herndon

3

versus Lee is the lav/ we are referring to, though, with

4

Mr. Justice White and the only opinion that I can talk to

5

you about of Alabama law interpreting these, you know, the

93

1

statutes we are involved in.

2
3
4

It simply says that September 5th is the date
to file with the Probate Judges or with the Secretary of
\
State the sundry certificates that go to the different places.

5

Q

Then you can file in either place?

6

A

No# you have to file your county offices ---

7

Q

In the Probate Judge.

8

A

In the Probate Judge.

9

You have to file your

district offices, the State law -—
Q

10

Is your position limited to the fact that

11

because the Secretary of State says there is no use in you

12

filing before the Probate Judge, that excuses you for not

13

filing before the Probate Judge?
A

14
15

no, sir.

18

now.

No, that is not the sole position we take,

We have other positions.

I will take them right

17

Q

That is one of them, isn't it?

18

A

That is a position.

The second one is that,

19

in fact,

20

acted for everybody, the second is that, in fact, some were

21

filed, you know, across the State and that these complex

22

factual issues were not determined by the District Court as

23

to who had and who had not.

24

the — when the Secretary of State acted, she

But, thirdly, we were turned back over to the same

Probate Judges, who, in some instances, turned us down to
determine whether we had done it or not.

Fourth, there is no hearing in Alabama law granted
anybody.

5

Fifth, that there was a discriminatory application

8

of the statute because this is the first -reported case where

7

someone has acted a Probate Judge on his own initiative, all

8

other reported cases have been otherwise.

9

That there is also an unequal application on the

10

part of the Probate Judges and, certainly,on the part of the

11

Secretary of State.

12

Q

I was thinking about

asking a case that said

13

just about that but because the law is only applied once, that

14

that is discriminatory.

15

A

Well, Judge Johnson said that there has been

16

a policy in the State of Alabama continuously, in his dissent,

17

of private enforcement of the statute, never public enforce­

18

ment, never before has anyone moved in to enforce it.

19

this particular case, this is the first instance.

20
21

22
23

In

We contend it is the first instance, that this is the
first real threat that has come along since this Act.
Q

So your only precedent is the dissent and opinion

in this case?
/

24

A

Our only precedent -—

25

Q

Judge Johnson is a good judge.

95

A

Thank you.

We do have one more though, and that is,certainly,
with respect to Greene County,and I think your recent decision
in Glover versus St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad Company,we
say it is not necessary to do a useless act like go to a
labor arbitrator, or, you know, to union officials, when you
know you can’t get adjudication.
I think we have something in the record that shows
that we are in the same sort of position.
mootness was raised.

Now, the question

The classic makes it quite clear that
'

we have a right to have our votes counted, I am talking about
across the board now, not just Greene County; we have a right
to hold primary elections, that depends on the amount of
votes we have.
It is a declaratory

judgment.

We need to decide

these matters now rather than a later time.
The District Court opinion does, of course, uphold
and did rule on the constitutionality of Sections 125 and 148
*

!

of the Alabama Code as well as the Garrett law and the
Corrupt Practices Act.
The

1

relief — a question was asked about that and

I just want to urge that the relief be as specific as possible..
You know when we talk

about primary elections in Greene

County, just remember we are talking about either one of
the two sets of figures we have got, 127 percent or 124 percent
96

]

of fche white population of the counties registered to vote.

2

Now, we know that is not right.

It can’t be, but

3

there are a lot of names there that don't live there.

Accuse

4

anybody anything with respect to that but I just say that

5

they are there.
That is one of the criteria the Attorney General

6
l

7

uses when sending examiners in and observers in for accounting,

0

is have they purged the rolls.
Second^, primary elections are run by the local

9

10

Democratic party votes, always. In those elections there is

11

always an alternate ballot position and in this case the

12

only relief we have so far and, I believe, after the three

13

Mississippi cases were argued here, and since there is such

14

concern about, you know, setting aside elections, that the

15

temporary relief of this Court could quite possibly have been

16

utilized to forestall the setting aside of any alections.
In that way, not go back and disturb anything.

17
18

in this case the only relief that we have now is that the

19

incumbents are in office and hold over under Alabama law.

20

The sheriff has been holding over since 1966.

21

Q

But,

Mr. Morgan, what if the Court happened to agree

22

with Judge Johnson but ultimately was found that Judge Herndon

23

was not in contempt?

24

elections?

25

A

What relief would be appropriate — new

Yes, I think new elections, first new elections.

97

1

I think certain things with respect to the order of a new

2

election should he done.

3

Q

I mean whether or not Judge Herndon was in

4

contempt, somehow there was a failure to bring the Court's

5

order hone to those who should understand it —
A

6

If we accept the contentions, as I understand

7

them, that he didn't have notice or the alternative contention,

8

that, if he had, he didn't understand it, under those circum­

9

stances I think they are still entitled, of course, to a new

10

election in Greene County.
Q

11

12

Well,

what if the Court decides, however, that

all these statutes are valid, or at least that one of them is

I
3

valid?

,4

A

If the Court decides that --

IS

Q

Then what about Judge Herndon?

A

Well, I think that as far as Judge Herndon

17
18
19
>0
!1

12

is concerned, he is still in contempt.
Q

Doesn't it make it irrelevant — the validity

of the statutes irrelevant to his -A

I don't in light of Walker and I don’t think

in light of the statement -Q

Then how about that if the Court holds that at

.

least one of these statutes is valid then what about relief?

14

There still might have been a violation of the Court's order.

15

A

We are talking about the Garret law now or

98

i

Corrupt Practices?

2
3

Q

Let's say they held the Corrupt Practices law

as constitutional.

4

A

Held it as constitutional.

5

Q

And that these candidates did not deserve

6

to be on the ballot.
A

7

Then, in that case, if they did not deserve

8

to be on the ballot, and you can't retroactively put them

9

on there — that has nothing to do with Judge Herndon's

10

contempt, but it does have something to do with whatever

11

relief is granted.
I do want to point out with respect to Section 125

12

13

on election officials that this record does disclose that

14

there were 120

15

of them were Negroes and 81 percent of the population is

16

Negro.
Q

17

election officials in Greene County, 14

Mr. Morgan, are we to understand that since

18

you don't seem to be independently arguing the merits, are you

19

buying the government's argument; is that it?

20

A

No, v/hich one?

21

Q

On

the merits.

22

A

On

the merits.

23

Q

On

the constitutionality.

24

A

On

the constitutionality of the Corrupt Practice *

25

Act.
99

1

Q

You haven’t said much about it yet.

2

A

The constitutionality of the Corrupt Practices

3

Act — I think that any act that deprives a man

of

the

4

right to be on a ballot and the voters who could vote for

S

him of the right to be on the ballot, by an arbitratry act, without

6

aright to a hearing, no right —- no due process right — to a

7

hearing at all, the Probate Judge says he is not entitled to

8

be on the ballot, no statute that gives him a right to go in

9

and get on the ballot, and in this instance it is September 5th,

10

I just don’t know what the man can do and I don’t see how that

11

can be constitutional, and that Corrupt Practices

12

certainly think that Corrupt Practices Ac£ generally should be

1:3

an art.

14

This particular provision --

IS

Q

Act, I

That is a due process argument independently

of any equal protection argument?

16

A

17

I think that — a due process independent of

any equal protection argument at all.

10

Secondly, I think that the statute, itself, by

19

20

its very wording is really rather vague as to what it does

21

say, and it is essentially a criminally statute.
I don’t know that you can read that statute and

22
23

know really what you are supposed to do.

J

tell what day you are supposed to file.

24

I

Q

I know you can’t

Why do you say it is essentially a criminal

100

Ii

z

statute?
A

I think so.

Yes.

It is a violation of the

3

Corrupt Practices

4

they can keep them'off the ballot, they can do that.

5i

Act, they can go after them that way or

I really have nothing more, if there are no more

6

questions except to say that,as the President said yesterday,

7

the laws have caught up with our conscience and what remains

8

is to give life to the law.

9
10
11

I think that is what this case is really all about.

above-entitled matter was concluded.)
