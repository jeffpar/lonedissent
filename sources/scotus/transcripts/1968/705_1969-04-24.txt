ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH WATKINS, ESQ.

No. 705, Joseph Q.

this court's decision in Harper versus Virginia State Board
of Elections applies to a local revenue bond election limited
to property taxpayers who have no special interest in the

13

election which would warrant a limitation.
14

The facts of this case may be briefly stated as
15

follows:

This suit was brought by Joseph Q. Cipriano as a

16

class action.

Mr. Cipriano is a resident of and a duly regis­

17

tered and qualified voter in the city of Houma, Louisiana.
18

The plaintiff does not own any real property in the
19

city of Houma nor does he pay any property taxes on any such
20

property.
21

On October 24, 1967, an election was held pursuant to
22
the statute challenged in this suit to authorize the issuance of
23

utility revenue bonds.

Under the applicable statute the

24

election was specifically limited to resident property
25
2

1

taxpayers.

2

prohibited from voting in this election by the effect of the

3

statute.

4

Appellant and all similarly situated persons were

The purpose of the election was to obtain authorization

5

from the electorate to issue $10 million worth of utility

6

revenue bonds with which to expand the utility system of the

7

city of Houma.

8

property taxpayers.

i 21

24

The election received a favorable vote by the

Of the 11,606 registered voters in the city of Houma,
4,680 are property taxpayers.

Of that latter number, 2724

actually voted in this electionj 1828 voted in favor of this
proposition, 896 against it.
The appellant brought his suit within the 60~day
period allowed and provided for by Louisiana statute and con­
tested a constitutionality of the voter classification or
qualification.
The trial court in a divided opinion with a dissent
by Justice Wisdom rejected appellant’s contention and from
that decision of a three-judge court the appellant appeals
to this court.
Q

Under the lav; a simple majority of the property

owners is sufficient, is it?
A

Under the law it is required, your Honor, that

there be a majority in both number and amount as we shall
point out, in number of taxpayers voting and a majority of the

25
3

*

accessed property owned.by those taxpayers who are actually

2

voting.

3

Q

That wasn't clear to me.

4

A

All revenue it is important to note, all revenue

Yes.

5

derived from the operation of the utility system over and above

6

that first revenue dedicated to repaying the bonds goes into

?

the general fund of the city of Houma and is used for general

8

city services.

9

Now we make special note of the fact that this is a

10

utility revenue bond election as distinguished from bonds which

n

are payable from the proceeds of property or ad valorem taxes.

\z

The applicable statutes provide that the revenue

13

bonds authorized by this election shall be repaid exclusively

14

and solely from the income derived from the operation of the

15

utility.

16

effectively precludes or prohibits the imposition or use of

17

any tax money to repay these bonds.

18

We maintain that by this limitation it is conceded

Additionally, the statutes also provide that the

19

full faith and credit of the issuing authority is not at stake.

20

Only the pledged revenues of the utilities are allowed to

21

secure the repayment of these bonds.

22

As I shall show, a property owner has no greater

23

stake or interest in this election than a nonproparty owner as

24

neither his property nor his property rights can in any way be

25

affected by the outcome of this election.
4

1

Now, the statutes of the State of Louisiana which

2

require the ownership of property we maintain therefore

3

insidiously discriminate in this instance against the appellant

4

and members of his class which together comprise 60 percent cf

5

the registered voters of the city of Houma»

6

Firstly, as I have stated the property owner as such

7

incurs no liability contingent or otherwise for the repayment

8

of the bonds.

9

owners and nonproperty owners alike use, he incurs no peculiar

to

liability as neither the property owner nor his property is in

11

any way peculiarly liable for the service or utility charge

12

or for the connection charge.

13

14
15

Secondly, as a user of utilities, which property

It is a contractual obligation in Louisiana between
the user and the supplier.
Thirdly, if the proposition to be voted on is eco­

16

nomically sound and this would result in an increase in revenues

17

over and above the bond repayment funds going into the general

18

city coffers so to speak, this is beneficial to all taxpayers

ie

and all residents in the city of Houma.

20

If on the other hand the proposition were to prove

21

economically unsound, resulting in less money going into the

22

23
24
25

general fund this would adversely affect all citizens as
additional tax money may be necessary to run the city.
Since over 90 percent of the total money generated
as revenues for the city of Houma, well over 90 percent, come
5

1

from sources other than property taxes we maintain that the

2

greater interest lies with that group or classification who

3

pays more than 90 percent of the funds into the general treasury

4

of the city.

5

And this would be the general electorate and the

6

general citizenry of the city of Houma„ the property owner,

7

a review of the stipulation of facts at page 19 and 20 of the

8

single appendix, paragraphs 7 and 8, together with the official

9

audit of the city of Houma.

24

Now the official annual audit for the city of Houma
for the year ending September 30, 1968, shows the gross
revenues of the city.

And this official audit, of course,

covers the period of this election which was October '67
through that same period in '68.
When these two items are combined and analyzed it
shows that property owners paid substantially less than 10
percent of the total revenues of the city.
We believe that the case of Harper versus Virginia
State Board of Elections is controlling in this instance.
Q

You really would be making the same argument

if these were general obligation bonds?
A

I don't believe it is necessary for me to go

that far, your Honor, in the sense that we can show here
that there is absolutely no relevancy and no possibility of
a tax being used.

25

6

1

2

Q

Your arguments really are applicable to the

general obligation bonds?
A

3

They may be, your Honor, to both,,

But in the

4

Harper case this court was concerned with the requirement of

5

the payment of a poll tax as a qualification to vote.

S

this case we are concerned with the requirement of a payment

7

of a property tax as a qualification to vote.
In the Harper case this court declared that voter

8

9

In

qualification has no relation to wealth nor to the paying or

10

not paying of this or any other tax.

In fact, wa maintain that

It

the present case presents to this court an easier question

12

than did Harper.
Now the dissenting Justices in Harper suggested that

13
14

the State of Virginia may have had a valid interest in the

15

poll tax either in deciding to collect additional revenues or in

13
17

18

believing that the voters who paid the poll tax comprised a
group which may have been more interested in the general
welfare of the State.
Under the fact of the present case neither of these

19

20
21

22

23
24

contentions can be taken seriously here.

As I have illustrated

the property owning taxpayer has no interest in the outcome
of the revenue bond election greater than any other voter.

In

fact, as a group they have decidedly less interest as they pay
less than 10 percent of the total revenues of the city of Houma.
Q

25
sold?

Mr. Watkins, have these bonds been issued and
7

1

A

Sir?

2

Q

Have these bonds been issued and sold?

3

A

No, sir, your Honor.

We filed our suit within

4

the SO-day statutory provision allowed by the Louisiana law

5

to challenge such an election and so actually no rights have

6
7

8

9
10
11
12
13
14

become vested in this case nor have any bonds been sold, nor
has the question become final.
Q

What, in your judgment, suppose we should agree

with you, what in your judgment would be the effect or might
be the effect of our adjudication upon outstanding revenue
bond issues?
A

Well, without wishing to presuppose any judgment

which the court may render, I would suggest as we have in our
reply memorandum, your Honor, that if this court were to
agree with us that it may limit if you will -- it may first of

15
16

all grant us the relief we pray for for this class action in
that no rights have become vested here nor have any bonds

17

issued nor did the matter become final.
18

We suggested in our reply brief that the court may
19

limit the retrospective effect of its decision to those cases
20
wherfe rights havQ not become final or where bonds have not
21

been issued.

22
As an example, I think we may have pointed out, your
23

Honor, if the election had actually been held and the full
24

time for challenge had passed, and the local authority may have
25

8

1

then gone on planning as they must preplan, we appreciate that,

2

there would be no manifest ill or no adverse effect by allowing

3

that one to stand since the time for challenging had passed.

4
5
6

Obviously where bonds have been issued the same rule
would apply as rights have become vested.
Q

In other words, you think that in a constitu-

7

tional decision that we might make could in the first place be

8

made nonretrospective and in the second place it would not

9

disturb vested rights at least where the time for challenge in

10

11

the State law had already passed?
A

I think the court clearly has the authority to

12

give its decision that effect.

13

prayed for as no rights have become vested nor the matter was

14

not finalised, and the court could limit the affect of its

15

decision to those cases where rights have not become vested

16

and where it has not become final.

17
18

Q

They can grant us the relief

I would suppose that in other kinds of situa­

tions we have just recognized

to side aside elections?

19

A

Sir?

20

Q

We haven’t in some cases set aside elections

21

once they have been held even if they were held under an

22

unconstitutional apportionment.

23
24
25

We have just recognized them

by de facto.
A

Fight.

Yes, your Honor, I appreciate that and I

can sincerely differentiate between the dire consequences the
9

1

court might have encountered in saying that we will hold a

2

completely legislature ill apportion and, therefore, all acts

3

passed are invalid, rights may have become vested, the court

4

has an obligation to preserve order and I think this was to

5

a large extent the court’s concern, preserving the due processes

6

of order, so to speak.

7
8

In this case this does not occur, your Honor.
rights have become vested-- Q

9
10

No

Oh, I understand.

I understand this case.

I

am talking about elections that have already been held.

11

A

Well, where ---

12

Q

And bonds have been issued.

13

A

Where the bonds have been issued a.& we have

14

spoken with Mr. Justice Fortas, where bonds have been issued,

15

rights have become final and vested and we see no difficulty

16

in the court limiting the effect of its decision clearly to

17

those cases where rights have not become vested, such as in this

18

C<dS6 •

19
20

Q

We don’t need to do it in terms of retrospective

effect of a constitutional decision, do we?

21

A

I am sorry, sir?

22

Q

We don’t need to do it in terms of retroactivity

23
24

25

or prospectivity, do we?
A

I am not sure, your Honor, in which terms you

may have to do it.

This is one suggestion only of a way in

10

1

which you may do it in keeping with what we consider the ruling

2

of this court in the Linklefcter decision.

3

to the application of this court of the Mapp decision in the

4

Linkletter case.

It is an analogy

We may additionally point out in this case, your

5

S

Honor, that not only is the qualification of paying a tax

7

violative of the Fourteenth Amendment as het forth in the

0

Harper case but the qualification of wealth i.s given added

3

emphasis.
In this case the property tax presupposes the

10
11

ownership of property, in addition to the payment of this

12

tax and the degree of wealth is even made a factor in the

13

present case by the statutory requirement that the proposition

14
13
16

be voted favorably upon by a majority in number of voters and
a majority in the assessed valuation of the property owned by
the voters.
Therefore, the wealthier vote is given a weighted

17
10
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

effect.

The wealthier man has a weightier vote.
Q

The richest man in town may not own any real

estate at all.
A

That is correct, sir, but if this rich man

owns real estate he is given a weighted vote.

The court below

surmised possible rational purpose for the limitation.

And

we submit that absolutely none exists for the three reasons
that we have previously given this court.
11

1

Appellees have previously advanced the suggestion

2

that the legislative purpose for the distinction in this voter

3

classification was, and I quote* "The desire to place a check

4

upon borrowing by governmental units*’’ at page 5 of the trial

5

brief„

6

We submit that if that classification was permissible

7

it has no relevance whatsoever to the purpose of this legis™

8

lation.

9

peculiar to the taxpayer or to his property effectively

IQ

To the contrary* the total absence of liability

invites him to vote with more or less unrestrained enthusiasm,

11

Exhibits P-1 through P-7 clearly show that the pro­

12

ponents of the bond issue constantly advise the taxpayers that

13

a favorable vote would protect his low property tax rate and

14

no new taxe3 could be added.
In the present case, all citizens have an equal

15
16

proprietary interest in revenues, equal proprietary interest

17

in city-owned properties? all citizens pay taxes into the

18

general fund.
As we have shown a comparison of the 1968 audit or

19
20

the fiscal year ending September 30,

2?

stipulation of facts shows that well over 90 percent of the

22

revenues are paid by the general electorate or the general

23

citizenry.

24
2.5

*60, together with the

Now we maintain that there is absolutely no justifi­
cation, your Honor, for this classification as set forth in

12

1

this particular statute»

2

the fact that a casual comparison as we have set forth in our

3

brief of the three different sections of Chapter 10 of the

4

title 33, of the Louisiana revised statutes, indicate that the

5

legislature provided three different methods for submitting

6

the same general proposition to the voters.

7

I may call to this court's attention

Subsection B provides for a bond election, sub­

8

section D and subsection C — B, C and D — the city elected

9

to use subsection C and of the three subsections this is the

10

only one that restricts the vote to property owners» Strangely

11

enough subsection B and subsection D both dealing with the

12

same proposition, both dealing with the same authority, both

13

pledging revenues and city properties owned by everybody,

14

two sections allow everybody to vote, one section allows only

15

property owners.

16
17

We submit that there is absolutely no justification
for the distinction.

18

Q

What

is the effect of this new Texas statute?

19

A

Sir?

20

Q

The subsequently enacted Texas statute?

21

A

Well, Act 33 of the Special Session —

22

Q

That is the one.

23

A

24

Q

I am

25

A

We maintain Act 33 of the Special Session of

-- we maintain has no -—sorry, I beg your pardon.

13

Louisiana.

1

1968, your Honor, has no bearing whatsoever on this case.

2

we have tried to point out to the court in our reply memorandum

3

the appellees cite a particular paragraph as being a paragraph

4

ratifying this election.
No. 1, it is very strange to us that the paragraph

5
6
7

which appellees claim ratifies

10
11
12
13
14
15
16

this election never uses the

word ratifies, confirms, or in any way assents to it.
The next paragraph dealing with previously issued

8
9

As

bonds, which is not the case here, does use these words,
ratify, and confirm.

Your Honor may find that statute quoted

at page 17 of the appellees' brief.

I did not reprint it as

the appellees had printed the act at page 17 of his brief.

f•

We maintain that certainly it was not the intention

of the legislature to ratify this election.

Secondly, we

maintain that the legislature cannot ratify action taken under
an unconstitutional State Act in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

17

To do so puts an action of the State Legislature of
18

Louisiana on an equal footing with the Fourteenth Amendment
19
20

to the United States Constitution.
Q

Why would it be unconstitutional?

A

Sir?

Q

How would that statute be unconstitutional?

21

22

Let

23

me put it this way.

Suppose a State or a municipality

24
authorized by the State just went ahead and its laws were set
25

14

1

up so that the revenue bonds could be issued without any vote

2

at all.

3

offend any provision of the Federal Constitution,,

4

right?

Now, I suppose it is arguable that that would not

5

A

S

Q

7

Is that

That is correct, your Honor»
I suppose your argument is that where they do

require a vote that vote has to be across the boards and

8

without discrimination?

9

A

We agree with your Honor that it would not have

10

been necessary for the State of Louisiana probably to require

11

an election but under Harper once an election is granted, once

12

the franchise is granted it must be consistent with the

13

Fourteenth Amendment»

14

Q

i
So that if the State of Louisiana here had

15

passed an appropriate statute, presumably, and there had been

16

no election then your position would be different with respect

17

to the force of that State statute, would it not?

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

If there had been no election and no election
authorized, no election called for by law?
A

That is correct, your Honor»

I see»

Once the

election or franchise is granted, Harper demands that it be
grahted in lines consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment»
I may point out this to your Honor.
Q

Well, then if you are correct that would nullify

the election that was held and this statute of your State,
15

1

Louisiana, says that the governing body may proceed with the

2

issuance and sale of the bonds whether or not the election is

3

a valid election,

4
5

A
But, I point this out to your Honor, If you
{
will notice the language of the statute itself it says that,

to

15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22

from page 18, the last paragraph of appellees' brief where he
has Set forth the statute — "In the event a property taxpayers'
election has heretofore been held and promulgated approving
the issuance of bonds „." — now even if we were to concede,
I
which we do not, that the State of Louisiana has the authority
to validate an unconstitutional act, this act in itself is
unconstitutional we maintain in that it recognises the unfair
-advantage given to the property owner.
Because this paragraph requires that you have had
an election and obviously you.must have had it under this
present statutej the city has chosen subpart C.
had an election it must have passed.

And if you

So this paragraph recog­

nizes the discrimination in requiring a previous election and
that it had been passed.
You could not do it according to this paragraph if
the city of Houma had an election and the bonds had been voted
down, this paragraph would not be applicable.

23
We maintain even to the extent that they recognise
24
the discrimination of the present statute in this act, this
25
16

?

act itself would not be applicable., Sven if they had the power

to do it which we do not,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Huppenbauer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. E. HUPPENBAUER, JR., ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

11

MR. HUPPENBAUER:

12

13

You may.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court.
There are really only two issues that this court need

14

15

concern itself with in this case.

Of course, there is the

16

constitutional issue and I think more importantly is the effect

17

of a decision of this court which may invalidate the procedure

18

under which this bond election was held.
You will note in the brief filed by the intervener,

IS
20

State of Louisiana, and the Louisiana Municipal Association

21

that there are fourteen States in the United States which have

22

similar voting requirement statutes.
In every instance, of course, this requirement is

23
24

applicable to the general obligation bonds and in most instances

25

a property taxpayer election is likewise required on a revenue
issue.

17

1

Now before I discuss whether or not the relief or the

2

decision of the court should be prospective or retrospective

3

certainly there will be serious nationwide consequences to

4

municipal securities if the retroactivity of this decision

5

goAs back totally or even partially.
Nevertheless, there are a few relevant facts which I

think this court should be apprised of.

Well, if it ,is not an essential governmental purpose,

how can you get it at all?

Are you in private business down

there?
A

This is a private business of the city.

Actually it

is a quasi-private business.
Q

A private business of the city?

A

Correct, sir.

Q

It is not private?

A

No, it is public.

A

Is that what Harper says?

Correct, but that was a dollar.

the doctrine of Sailors versus the Board of Education, as
against the Reynolds case.

is purely a quasi — this is a propriety interest of the city

So he has no right to vote on what might happen to

No, because we feel this is not within the purview

of Harper.

Well, Harper dealt with money, didn't it?

made provided it is not arbitrarily and invidiously discrimi­
natory .
We feel like the election here was purely an administrative
function coupled with the other approvals necessary.
Q

Might there not be a temptation on the part of the

property owners to have a higher rate for this utility so
that it would make a profit and the general fund would benefit
from it and thus reduce their taxes and in that manner cast a
burden on the people who were not property owners?
A

That certainly would probably be one of their desires

25

but still be elected officials»

Q

Isn't that the reason that provision is in the Act?

I don't believe- your Honor.

Similarly we argue the interest here is mores predominant
in the taxpayer because he has to have utility to serve his
property to make it valuable or salable.

11

Q

Everybody has to pay for it, though?

12

A

Correct.

Everybody has to pay for it, but the rates

13

fixed are by the elected officials, not by the taxpayer himself.

14

The rates are fixed by elected officials.

15

elected officials are very cognizant of rates.

tax rate down or keep the utility rates down.

the nonresident taxpayer who may live in another State or

Stewart asked you.
Reading the record here 1 gather that there is

operated in the city.

They have committed themselves to long-term

contracts with Westinghouse, General Electric to buy generating
capacity.
This money is needed to house and to extend the
lines from that generating unit.

It is all tied into a long

range program.

I think is very important, not only to Louisiana but to the
other thirteen States which have similar types of voting
procedures.

prospective effect where they found inequities to exist where
there would be dire circumstances which would arise to vested
interests.
Mow there are millions and billions of dollars of
bonds outstanding by not only Louisiana and the other States
but many municipalities Which have either voted and sold all
the bonds, bonds have been delivered, there are many instances
v?here bonds have been voted but the complete issue has not yet
been delivered.
If you make your decision retrospectively even to the
date of say the Houma election, you are going to cut off many
bonds that have been previously authorised but not yet issued.

that have bonds voted but not issued to allow them to continue

It so extends I believe to this particular case
because the city of Houma did hold the electionf it was properly

of Louisiana.

the anticipation perhaps that this court may nullify the
procedures already they then adopt a double system now.

The

municipality can continue under the same system or you can go
to a general election where all registered voters are eligible
to vote.
This, however, acts prospectively.

The Act, 1 think,

attempted to cure and permit the issuance of all bonds which
have been previously voted.

This same effect, I think a

decision by this Court, if it were retroactive would affect
all the other States which had similar statutory requirements
or constitutional requirements.
In many instances it would leave projects which are
partially completed from financing, or projects which have been
approved by the voter for which commitments have been made
where by the issuing authority of the municipality or the
political subdivision could not then find the financing if this
decision is retrospective in any effect.
We believe that to avoid a calamity in the municipal

25

31

I

market in this country that the fairest prospective relief

2

that could be afforded in this case should the court find this

3

procedure is unconstitutional is to apply it solely to

4

elections to be called hereafter, which would allow bonds to

5

be issued under elections previously conducted where many

6

commitments have been made by political subdivisions.

7

Q

I suppose that if one were compelled to defend

S

what was dona here one might argue that the class that has an

9

interest in whether revenue bonds should be issued is a class

10

of property owners because the purpose of the issuance of the

11

revenue bonds is to provide utilities systems that on a long

52

term basis will affect the value of the property and the

13

property owners.
That if the tenants, the users of the utilities, that

14
15

the interest of the users of the utilities is in the rates

16

and their interest in the question of the issuance of the

17

bonds is a secondary one that is too remote to justify vindi­

18

cation in the courts as a matter of Federal constitutional

19

law.

20

A

That, I think, is our position wrapped up very

21

beautifully, that rates are distinct from the bond issue here.

22

The expansion or development affects more directly the land

23

owner if the user himself as well as the property owner who

24

is also a user is dissatisfied with his rate he then has a

25

right to elect new city officials who themselves alone have a
32

1
2
3
4

right to fix these rates.
Q

Well, I am sure you don't accept what I said

just now as an indication that I am persuading myself.

I agree, sir.

Because this is not an essential Government purpose?
this is purely one which involves an administrative function
of the Government, a quasi-corporation operation.
Q

Excuse me.

Would you be bettsr off if the money

involved was restricted to the tax on real property?
A

I think the greater interest definitely in the

general obligation bond is predominantly in the taxpayer.

But

we feel in view of the statement Justice Fortas just indicated,
there is more of an interest in the land ownar :o see that
property is developed with utility services extended to them.
Q

But I understood this is a bond issue which

pledges the money of all of the taxpayers.
A

This bond issue only pledges the revenue derived

from the operation of the utility system.
Q

And?

A

That is all.

Q

And?

A

But the surplus which may be derived —

That is what I was talking about.

a surplus.

Oh, I think you can,, because tie city — there

are many types of reserve payments, resexve f inds; which must,

6

be established in issuing bonds.
Q

7

Did I understand you that where a municipality

8

is issuing bonds of all different kinds that Lt requires a

9

vote of the citizens, you can on one bond issue restrict it to

10

property owners, on the other one restrict it to nonproperty

11

owners and the other restrict it to nonreside its.,

go that far, do you?

Q

And Harper says whenever you set up an election

you have to abide by the Fourteenth Amendment, in any election.

3

A

But, Jvistice Marshall, the Harper case was

4

really concerned with the election of political officials.

5

Every case relied upon in Harper dealt with that, not an

6

administrative function.

7

Q

Very often you look at the last paragraph of an

a

opinion and you will find just what 1 said in that last

9

paragraph.
A

10

I realize the language is quite strong, but you

have the Sailors case involving the one-man, one-vote rule,

12

which has made a distinction.

13
14

Q

Well, then maybe we had better clear it up again

A

Perhaps so, but this court in Avery just last

here.

15
16

term recognized again the distinction of voting requirements on

17

administrative purposes rather than purely total governmental

18

function.

19

Notwithstanding the decision of the court to all

20

bond issues or whether it be retrospective or prospective,

21

we feel that since there is no constitutional requirement,

22

either State or Federal, that the Louisiana Legislature had a

23

right and did in fact validate the issuance of chess bonds at

24

issue in this instance.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH WATKINS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

MR. WATKINS:

There are only a few comments I think I would like to

7

make with respect to Mr. Huppenbauer’s argument.
No. 1, I think it is important to point oitt that

these bonds we are talking about in this case are not general
f

10

obligation bonds,

11

referred to in the amicus brief.

'i 2

Contrary to the statistics Mr. Huppenbauer

Although it didn't reflect it here, the statistics in

13

the amicus brief are somewhat misleading in that the real

14

gem of this is that no general obligation bends are here, no

15

tax money can be used, and that the statistics shown in the

IS

amicus brief fail to clearly set forth the number of States

17

where the general obligation bonds are not in effect.

18

We believe there are only three States in the Union

19

so far as we can ascertain from our research:

20

Texas and Idaho that have any requirement even similar to this

21

with a nongeneral obligation bond in question.

22

Louisiana,

With regard to Mr. Huppenbauer's argument on the

23

spector of confusion, gentlemen, simply does not exist.

State law can be made applicable as this court did in Linkletter.

finality period for contesting a bond issue?

8

period, that is measurable in months rather than years?

9

A

That finality

Wo, sir, I can't off-hand tell you that, your

10

Honor.

11

it to the court if the court would feel that it would want it.

12

But I am not prepared to give the court that statement of fact

13

as to the number of States that require mentis instead of years.

I would be glad to have that matter checked and submit

I would certainly assume, however, as Mr. Huppenbauer

14
15

has actually argued, that every State has sons period that at

16

some point you have to have a finality for somebody to buy the

17
18

bonds.
Q

I am sure of that, but in terms of years a

19

decision such as you are requesting might very well be extremely

20

disruptive and a great deal of money.

21

A

I will only suggest that the question of years

22

is in all probability not in play here, your Honor, as who

23

would want to wait years before they could sail a bond?

24

I am sure nobody would want to buy a bond whan the matter had

25

not become final as Mr. Huppenbauer had suggasted.
37

And

They have to have an opinion from a competent bond

1
2

attorney and these competent bond attorneys must certainly

3

certify that the time for challenge has passed,,

4

no issuing authority would want to wait several years before

5

they issued bonds.

I am sure

6

Q

This is a pretty small town, isn't it?

7

A

The town is about 35,000 people now, your Honor.

8

Q

And Louisiana Power and Light has about what,

9

10 to 20 percent of the electrical system?

10

11
12

16

18
£0

21

I would estimate that, your Honor.

Q

There must not be much revenue hare at stake,

A

Well, the question is this, your Honor, if we

are going into that phase of it, not necessarily a question of
revenue at stake but as we discussed earlier, this is a
question of possibly a using revenue in lieu of tax and not
giving the majority of people the right to vote on it.
Q

17
18

A

Oh, I am not talking about that, I am talking

about what is the real interest here.

The Louisiana Power and

Light.
A

Well, the real interest of that company, your

Honor, 1 couldn't say.

Mr. Cipriano does work for them but

we do have 6,000 other plaintiffs.

This is a class action.

(Whereupon, at 11:23 a.m. the oral argument in the
23

above-entitled matter was concluded.)
