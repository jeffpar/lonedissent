ORAL ARGUMENT OF GRADY B. STOTT, ESQ.
6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
7

MR. STOTT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

0

Court.
9

This case came to this court from the District Court
10

of the District of Columbia.

The case was heard in the

11

District Court here in Washington before Judges Wright,
12
Robinson and Gasch.
13

The opinion of these justices was a — two of the
14

judges wrote an opinion which we contend, first of all, was
15
16
17

IS
19

20
21

22
23
24

based on a theory that was not justified under the 1965
Voting Rights Act.
The concurring opinion of Judge Gasch was based on
a different theory, a theory that because Gaston County had
failed to maybe offer evidence that we did not discriminate by
the use of a test or device in municipal elections.
The record itself will show that the municipal
elections, of course, were not under the control of the County
Board of Elections.

So just to give just a brief background,

I would like to point out that it was in March of 1966 that

25

2

1

we were certified by the Attorney General and subsequent at

2

that time was printed in the Federal Register- and in August

3

of 1966 we filed this suit in the District Court and it was

4

heard here in June, June 21 and 22 of the following year.

5

These two opinions, after having been handed

down,

6

we appealed to this court and probable jurisdiction has been

7

noted on January 13, 1969.

8
9

The three main points that we would like to argue
in connection with this case is first of all that Gaston County

10

and the record we contend is replete with evidence that we at

11

no time have used a test or device to discriminate because of

12

race or color or for any other reason.

13

We set out in the record, we brought witnesses here

14

to Washington, both the white and Negro race to show to the

15

court that this particular county in North Carolina was not one

1G

that this act was designed for.

17

In reading the case, of course, of South Carolina

IQ

against Katzenbach, against which the history of this whole

19

act or the purpose of the act was set forth in stating that the

20

repressive type of thing that was going on in some other

21

States in the Union to at least try to avoid that type of

22

conduct continuing.

23
24

25

We contend that Gaston County does not fall into
that same category.
So we then presented evidence, we brought with us
3

I

these witnesses who testified orally.

2

depositions without any oral testimony.

3

action did offer depositions,

4

offered 29 depositions plus some other documentary evidence.

The Government offered
Both parties to the

i believe that the Government

5

We offered depositions of about 11 people, I believe.

6

Now, we first, in the record it will indicate that

7

in 1962, a new registration was adopted in Gaston County, and

8

this was a system called a permanent loose-leaf type regis­

9

tration .

to

Until that time we had had — well, I guess, maybe

11

1940 was the only other time that anything had been done about

12

the registration books, but in 1962 a complete new registration

13

was ordered, called the MacMillan System and it was by statute

14

that we adopted this system in North Carolina.

15
16
17

18

The Chairman of the Board of Elections at that time,
starting in April, and in April until May of 1962, conducted
a registration so that the voters would be eligible to vote
in the May Primary of 1962.

IS

The evidence will probably indicate that during that

20

short period of time we registered in our county approximately

21

22
23
24
25

30-some thousand people.

It was around that figure — I am

not exact about that — but approximately 30,000 people, which
you might, say was in a period of approximately 15 days and
three Saturdays within that period from April until May 21st.
Subsequent to that time — prior to that time.
4

1

however, I want to call the court's attention to what Gaston

2

County did in order to give every citizen the right to

3

register, to vote and to participate in the election process.,

4

First of all, the county increased the number of

5

voting precincts from 35 to 44 precincts»

6

was to make it more convenient for our people to register and

7

at the same time more convenient for them to be able to vote

8

after they had registered.

9

That, of course,

Now under this new system of registration, the elec­

10

tion books are kept open every day of the year from Monday,

11

8:30 a.m. until Friday, 5 o'clock each day.

12

done since 1962.

13

And that has been

The record and it was stipulated and agreed that all

14

of our registration process would relate back to that period of

15

time, 1962.

16

referred to in the Voting Rights Act of 1955.

17

It was a little less than the five-year period

So, we in an effort to make sure that the people knew

18

about this, the county spent thousands of dollars and that is

19

also in the record.

20

We conducted school.

The Chairman of the County

21

Board of Elections conducted schools for the registrars, many

22

of the registrars who had served in the past were reappointed,

23

and, of course, we had new registrars because of the increase

24

in the number of votinq precincts.

25

Well all of these registrars attended these schools
5

1

for the purpose of instructing them under this new system of

2

registration and also to give them what we understood the law

3

to be, the law of the State of North Carolina and the test

4

that we thought at that time to be used and was used, and, of

5

course, until 1964, the oral type test was used.

6

After the *64 Civil Rights Act we changed that test

7

to a written test and we contend that all of this has been in

8

conformity, of course, with Lassiter versus Northampton County.

9

That case has been kicked around by the Attorney General and

10

by us, of course, in our brief as to what effect now the

11

Voting Rights Act of '65 has on the decision in Lassiter versus

12

Northampton County.

13

We contend that we followed the test that was stated

14

by this court, was one that was not on its face discriminatory,

15

and we say that even with the Voting Rights Act now of 1965,

16

that there has been no change because the test that we used

17

in this county which was a simple, that is, since 1964, a

18

simple test.

19

We took what we considered to be the simplest three-

20

sentences from the North Carolina Constitution, and we then

21

would give this to a register or a person who had applied for

22

registration and

23

of Elections, after this test was adopted in 1964, that a

24

person was not required to copy every word of that test, or

25

every word of either of the one of the three sentences

as was testified by the Chairman of the Board

6

from

1

the Constitution that he may select, but a reasonable facsimile

2

thereof.
So, now even in 1964, I would like to remind the

3
4

Court, that again before this 1964 election — now the general

5

election of '64, we had again the registrars, a school in ways

6

of conducting this test, because we were using a different

7

test after 1964 in order to conform with the Civil Rights Act

8

of 1964.

9

So then we also ran many newspaper advertisements

10

at a cost to the county of many thousands of dollars.

11

radio spot announcements.

We did everything that we thought

citizens of Gaston County that we were having a new regis­
tration and that we wanted as many as possible to come and
register without regard for race, creed or color.
Q

Just as a matter of interest, this very simple

literacy test you have, what is the purpose of this?
A

We-1 the purpose is to comply with -—

Q

What does it do?

What does it prove?

A

The purpose, your Honor, is to comply with the

Constitution of the State of North Carolina, and to comply
with section 163-3 — I don't recall the exact section but
pertaining to the voting in Gaston County.
Q

I see.

I see.
And in order to comply with our Constitution

6

and in ogder for our county officials to do so, we selected

7

what we contended to be the most simple type thing that we

8

could possibly select in order to comply with that law.
Now I wanted to-- -

Q

Do you admit that this is a quote "test or

defined in the section of the 365 Act.

We do that.

14

Q

Where does that leave you?

15

A

Well, it leaves us — we contend that we have

16

not used it for the purpose or with the effect of discriminating

17

against any person because of race or color and we contend as

18

Judge Gasch said in his opinion, that nowhere in this record

IS

could he find any evidence that,would justify the finding of

20

the majority that simply because we had had a segregated

21

system of education in North Carolina and this is the whole

22

basis as I read the opinion of Judges Wright and Robinson,

23

that simply because North Carolina had in the past a dual

24
25

system of education that that in itself had the effect or
would fall within the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of
8

'i

1965, with the words with the effect of denying or abridging

2

the right of a person to vote»

3

Now we contend that as set forth in our brief that

4

Congress never meant any such thing as that because at the

5

time this Act was adopted, they were aware of these dual

6

system States.

in many States other than the ones that this Act was designed

Assume for the moment that North Carolina down

through the years has forbidden Negroes to go to school at all.
A

I didn't hear you, your Honor.

Q

Assume North Carolina had forbidden Negroes to go

to school at all and then wanted to apply a literacy test and
applied it.
Would you suppose it would be with the effect —
would that then be a test or device within the Act?
A

It would be a test or device within the Act,

but had that been true at the time that Congress enacted this
legislation, then I say that Congress would have said because
you have practiced segregation in the schools or have had a
dual system of education or that you have denied your people -Q

They said with the effect of though.

A

It would have the effect.

The purpose or effect, and it would have the

effect of denying them the right to vote?

1

A

If we use this simple test,

2

Q

If you used this test and also you didn't let

3

Negroes go to school.

4

A

Well, I say again, and the only answer that I

5

can give to his Honor is that that was not true in the first

6

place in North Carolina, but if that had been true, the

7

Congress would have said in a State where the Negroes have been

8

denied the right to attend school at all, use this test.

9

shall not period, give any test or use any test or device of

to
11

You

any kind.
Q

Well, I gather the majority of the court, below

12

found that because of the kind of school system that you did

13

furnish, that the Negroes weren’t permitted to get enough of

14

an education to pass the literacy test.

15

A

That is exactly the basis of their decision.

16

Q

Do you challenge that part of their decision?

17

A

I challenge that part strongly.

10

Q

That in terms of the system of education that

19

was available, that Negroes couldn't pass the literacy test?

20

You challenge that part of it?

I challenge it strongly and I say that the

evidence in the case showed ——■

Under the law.

evidence in the case shows that 52 percent of the Negroes of

11

13

I would still say that we deserve to win the

And 62 percent had what?
Sixty-three percent of the whites had.

Now

there is a discrepancy of approximately 11.1 percent.
Now, I pointed out and have set out in the brief that

in this case of United States against Texas — which was
affirmed by this Court —- and that was a poll tax case, but
in that case, the Government and in every one of these cases
they have adopted this same approach that because of the
segregated facilities, United States against Mississippi and
United States against Texas, because there were segregated
facilities, that that in itself has the effect or is dis­
criminatory because of a segregated or a dual school system.
Now in the case of United States against Texas,
there where the Government had the same type evidence and Judge
Thornberry, I believe his name was, stated that he could not

25

11

1

take that evidence where there was only a discrepancy of

2

approximately

3

the poll tax and the Negro who paid the poll tax, and that

4

that was not sufficient in his opinion as a discrepancy to

5

justify saying that the segregated school system was the

6

reason for or was sufficient to justify that they should have

7

to pay a poll tax or not pay a poll tax.
Now, I contend that in our situation, in Gaston

8
9

2 percent between those -- the whites who paid

County that we have a discrepancy of

-some —

.

percent,

10

and that that in itself is certainly not evidence of use of a

11

test or device for the purpose of denying or abridging the

12

right of a person to register and vote.
Now one other thing I wanted or would like to mention

3
4

to you in tthat regard, we brought with us a Negro school man,

5

who had been in the public schools of Gaston County since

16

7

932.

He testified before this court, and he was asked whether

he had an opinion as to whether or not the schools since 1932

18

had sufficient facilities and were equipped to teach a child

19

or a person to read and write well enough to pass this simple

20

test that is in this record.

21

Well, he said, and his answer was that all of our

22

schools, I think, all of them would be able to teach any

23

Negro child to read and write so that he could read a newspaper,

24

so that he could read any simple material that didn’t have any

25

foreign words or extractions; this has always been true and
2

i

don't think there was an argument anywhere except that maybe

2

the facilities were different but they have been basically able

3

to teach this and this is what they have done.

4

Now the amazing thing to me was that the majority of

3

the court below said this testimony is unpersuasive to me,

6

and just you might say completely ignored that testimony.

7

Well, it was rebutted and under the case of South

6

Carolina against Katzenbach, it says that all the unit needs

9

do is to submit an affidavits, voting officials and then

10

refute whatever evidence the Government may offer to the

11

contrary.
Q

12

13

May I conjecture for a moment what would happen

to him if he testified to anything else other than that?
/

14

A

What would have happened?

15

0

Yes, sir.

16

A

There wouldn't have anything happened to him.

17

Q

He is a school principal?

18

A

Absolutely.

IS

Q

Subject to dismissal?

20

A

2?

Q

22

A

I say absolutely not in Gaston County.
He couldn't be dismissed?
He could be, but I am saying that in Gaston

23

County that we don't operate in that manner, if it please his

24

Honor.

25

I am saying that this man ——
Q

Is he principal of a colored school?

13

1

A

No, he is not a principal.

He was at that time.

2

Q

Of a colored or white school?

3

A

Of a Negro, colored school.

4

But now, of course, we have had a consolidation of

Yes.

5

our schools since this time and. since the trial of this case,

6

but I am saying that if he had testified truthfully and which

7
8

I am satisfied in my mind he did, that certainly his testimony
should have been given certain weight.

in the county.

9

Q

What is it?

A

That school is not any longer a high school»

3

is now an elementary or grammar school, one of the two»

4

not sure.

5

with the white school called the Ashley High School and now

6

these schools are merged.

7

It

I am

Because the school he was principal of was merged

But this, I contend that this testimony should have

8

been persuasive because it was unrebutted.

We had other

9

witnesses who testified and certainly there was no threat from

10

anybody that had he not testified in this regard something

11

would have happened to him.

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

Because after all, I think the evidence itself
shows that here we have got 52 percent of the Negro eligible
to register that actually registered.

That certainly should

be some evidence that we in Gaston County are not the kind of
people who would come and make a threat to a person to make
him testify to anything, because we contend that this evidence
in this record shows and the statistics themselves show
that we have not used a test or device for the purpose of
discrimination.
Q

I thought the point about that testimony was

that the witness had become familiar with the schools only
in the early 1930's and a good many of the older voters of
course would have gone to school before that time and that this
witness accepting fully the truth of what he testified to,

25

15

1

simply could not testify to conditions prior to the 1930's„

2

A

That is correct.

3

Q

And that ■— I don"t know what percentage —

4

but a substantial number of voters are people who would have

5

gone to school prior to that dates
A

6
7

I don9t recall the exact percentage, but

approximately 25 to 30 percent, maybe.

But that was the

8

testimony that he did come to the system in 1932.

9

testimony that we felt was unrebutted.

This was

Judge Gasch in his opinion said that he felt that the

10
11

majority had just completely ignored this testimony and it

12

should have been given weight, which he felt was not.
Of course, we also felt that it should have been

13
14

given considerable weight.

Q

What do you say about Judge Gasch9s other

A

Well, we feel that in that connection that the

grounds?

Attorney General under the Act was required to make a certifi­
cation to the municipality within the county.

We say that the

Act itself -- and when you refer to the definition of a
political subdivision, as set out in section 14(c)(2) of the
1965 Voting Rights Act, that the Attorney General was required
under the Act to certify to that unit becaase the county
16

1

itself had no control over the municipal election in our

2

county by virtue of State law.

3

We have eleven municipalities, I believe, as the

4

record will show and we say that since we had no control over

5

these elections, none whatever, we couldn't say to the

6

registrar, by virtue of State law again, why you don't do this

7

or this is the type of test you shall or shall not give»

8
9
10

The lav; gave, in our State, the tight to hold a
municipal election to the municipality itself.
I wanted to mention at this point that the Attorney

11

General entered into a consent judgment with Wake County which

12

is a county right here right in our own State, using the same

13

type of test or similar type test that we use in Gaston County,

14

and they say and enter into a consent judgment that has the

15

same type of school system that we have had in the whole State,

16

a segregated type system, so yet they say in Wake County, the

17

fact that you had a segregated school system doesn't affect

18

you but Gaston County it does.

19

We say that

that in itself prevents Gaston County

20

or anybody else with a

21

tion, or in the past of having that type thing of ever coming

22

out from under this Act.

23
24
25

segregated or a dual system of educa­

We contend, if it please the court, that certainly
the five years mentioned in the Act has some — means something.
They said relate back to five years, but of course, the
17

1

Government has gone back in here to 1900 and brought in

2

newspaper headlines from the Raleigh News Observer and put in

3

evidence which we have no way to refute what the newspaper

4

said in 1900 and that type of thing, which is part of the

5

evidence, but we do argue to you that certainly the fact that

6

there was a segregated system, it should not have any bearing

7

on this decision and that the Congress did not mean that it

0

would and that that in itself would do so.

9

Mainly on the question then of the last point, or

10

the point that Mr. Justice Harlan asked me about, as to the

11

municipality and the part that Judge Gasch ruled or in the

12

form that he ruled, we say, your Honor, that if we had had

13

control of these elections, then it would have been our

14

responsibility.

Of course, to have refuted evidence adduced by the
Government in regard to municipal elections, but we had no
such authority.
Q

Do you think the legislative history of the

Act supports Judge Gasch's view?
A

I don't believe so.

Q

There isn't very much on the point.

A

There is not very much on that point but, of

course, there is a great deal on the first point about the
segregated systems or unequal educational system.
Q

Yes.

I was thinking about the other point.

1

A

There is very little in the brief of the United

2

States.

3

territorial effect but the term political subdivision as

4

defined in the Act, it says the term political subdivision

5

shall mean any court or parish, except — I read, I said

6

"court," the term political subdivision shall mean any county

7

or parish except where registration for voting is not conducted

8

under the supervision of the county or parish the terms shall

9

include any other subdivision of a state which conducts

They argue that the word "in" and that it had a

10

registration for voting, but I contend that Inhere they had in

11

mind that you didn’t have control over it, then, of course,

12

you would have to be certified under section 4(b) of the Act,

13

the coverage formula, before you would be required to suspend

14

the test.

15

And we contend for that reason we did not and were

16

not required to present evidence in regard to the municipal

17

elections over which we had no control.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

Where do you think the burden of proof lies in

one of these cases?
A

Well, the burden of proof, under the Act, and

quoting again from the Katzenbach, South Carolina versus
Katzenbach, that all that a political unit or subdivision needs
do is to get affidavits and other type of information from
voting officials asserting that there has been no such dis­
crimination or use of a test for purposes of discriminating.
19

1

And then it goes on to say and then the plaintiff,

2

in the action or the petition, must refute whatever evidence

3

to the contrary the Government may adduce,,
So then that throws a burden back to the plaintiff

4
5

of going forward, I would say, to show that there has been no

6

use of a test or device for the purpose of denying or abridging

7

the right of a person to vote because of race or color.

There is none in this record.

Q

But any judgment for the county would reinstate

or would allow the municipal electors to resume the use of
the literacy test?

21

And there is no showing in this record as to

how the municipal registrars have administered the precinct

5

7

All of the municipalities have their own

registrars.

12

3

There are separate municipal registrars within

Isn’t that right?

A

Well, it would.

Q

Without any evidence whatever as to whether

they have used them in a nondiscriminatory way?
A

22

t

That is correct. And the Attorney General has

never made any determination or investigated so far as we know
£3

as to whether municipalities did in any way use a test or
24

device.

I can't answer that, your Honor.

I know that

just recently the city of Gastonia, the largest municipality
within the county has had a new registration.

This is within

the last two or three weeks.

15

17

What actually happened?

been using a literacy test?

14

16

The record is silent on that

point.

10

11

The Attorney General only notified the Chairman

of the County Board of Elections and so far as the record

8
9

But the use was suspended wasn't it by the

test.

Q

Are they using a literacy test?

A

I can't say that they are using a literacy

I can't say that they are because I understand that

they were not using one.

But I cannot state that as a matter

of fact to this court.
Q

I don't suppose it is surprising that Judge

Gasch was concerned about the state of the record with respect
20

to the municipality.
21

A

Without any evidence of you mean of what went

22

on in the municipalities?
23

Q

Yes, because he was being asked to enter an

24

order which would in effect sanction the use of the literacy
25

21

1

test by the municipalities without any evidence;

2

(a) as to what they had been doing

3

(b) whether they had quite doing whatever they had

4

been doing.

5

A

But was it responsibility of a political sub­

6

division that had no control over it to adduce evidence in

7

that regard and that is the position we take that there was

8

no certification and we were not required under the Act because

9

it doesn't say so to do, to furnish evidence with regard to

10

use of test by municipalities.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.

13

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. CLAIBORNE:

14
15
16
17
18

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court.
If I may I would like at the outset to put this case
in a somewhat different perspective.
It seems to me important to remember that we are

19

dealing here with a literacy test that was never meant to serve

20

any purpose of assuring illiteracy but which was immediately

21

even boastfully invented and conceived for the sole purpose

22
23
24
25

of keeping the franchise entirely in white hands.
That, of course, was a long time ago, and the literacy
test has worked its purpose in that respect.
something over a half century.

22

It involved

1

But we are also dealing with a test which for these

2

reasons the Congress recently isolated as a presumptive cause

3

or a presumptive cause of the low Negro registration in the

4

areas covered by the Act, including Gaston County, North

5

Carolina.
I

And the question now is whether after this history

6
1

in light of the purpose and effect of this literacy provision

8

we may safely assume that if the prohibition were lifted, the

9

literacy test would cease to have a discriminatory effect on

10

11
12

13

voting.
It seems to me that in light of this the presumption
must be against it.
Now it is true that North Carolina and Gaston County

14

in particular, have made very important progress, dramatic

15

progress in this area, by comparison to some other areas that

16

I am more intimately familiar with, it is notable that Negro

17

registration in 1964 was at about 50 percent of those who were

18

potentially eligible within the county and the record clearly

19

reflects that commendable efforts were made at least in

20

Gastonia, the city of Gaston County which includes about a

21

third of the population toward encouraging Negro registration.

22
23
24
25

But the Court should not believe that all is well
in the best of all possible worlds in Gaston County.
It is a fact that until 1965, every registrar of
voters was white and in that year, 1 out of 44 was a Negro,
23

1

appointed* however, only to handle registration in the pre­

2

dominantly Negro section of Gastonia.
It is also revealing that as late as 1966 when the

3
4

school,the high school which has been referred to here, which

5

was under the Negro —

6

witness at the trial that high school was sought to be inte­

7

grated by

8

students.

21

23
24

25

of which the Negro principal was a

assigning to it 300 white students and 300 black

Two hundred ninety-seven of the white students
transferred out, leaving only three of them in school.
Finally, I don't want to put much emphasis on this,
because we are dealing with an elderly man but he is still a
registrar of voters in Gaston County.

Certainly the millennium

has not come to this place when in this record we read a
registrar of voters talking about those he has registered of
the Negro race as good niggers.
One wonders whether they would be registered at all
if it had been otherwise.
Now on the other hand, it would be unfair to condemn
Gaston County because of the sins of our fathers, our grand­
fathers, those who are now the officials of that place, but
it would be equally improper and unfair to ignore what
subsists of the influence of the past on the presence, and
that is, after all the scheme of the Voting Rights Act.
It is not so much or not entirely a question of the
24

1

present purpose of the present officials.

2

the effect, and effect alone is sufficient to prevent the

3
4
5

reinstatement of these tests and devices, of the effect that
these tests and devices had in the recent past and also what
the effect would be if they were allowed to be brought back.
So we get down to the question whether the influence

6
7
8

of the past has really been swept away with respect to voting
in Gaston County.
Q

9
10

11
12

It is a question of

Mr. Claiborne, excuse me,

the 52 percent

of the Negroes registered after the literacy test had been
suspended?
A

No, Mr. Justice, that is the figure although

there may be some debate whether it should be 50 or 52 but in
13

any event it is in that range, that was the figure for
14

November of '64 at the time when this county was certified
15

as subject to the Act.
16

Q

I see.

17

A

The figure today, while it is not in the record,

18

it is the figure supplied by the State Board of Elections, and
19
it does seem to me relevant, it is now 61 percent.
20

Q

Sixty-one?

A

Sixty-one percent

21

of thevoting age, Negro

22

population, of Gaston County.
23

Q

That is after theliteracy

test..

24

A

That is the effects, a somewhat delayed effect,

25

25

i

of the suspension of these tests or at least presumptively so.

2

Q

After it anyway?

3

A

Now the Voting Rights Act itself assumes as a

4

general matter that it takes at least five years free of these

5

tests and devices before the effects of the past have been

6

fully erased and even that is a rather optimistic assumption»

7

becaxtse discrimination for the better part of a century, as

8

this Court wall knows, is not always so quickly wiped away.
It is true, however, that the Voting Rights Act pro­

9
10

vides that one need not wait out the five years, ever though

11

tests and devices were used, if it can be shown contrary to

12

the presumption of the Act that those tests and devices did not

13
14
15

have any effect in discriminating against the Negro franchise,
then the subdivision involved is entitled to immediate
exemption.
Q

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

The five-year, the general five-year presumption,

as you call it, it would be demonstrably invalid if the reason­
ing of the majority of the court here is correct, because quite
obviously the fairest literacy test in the world two years
from now, whenever the five years has elapsed, is going to
discriminate against Negroes if the majority of this court is
right.
Is that correct?
A

Mr. Justice, what you say is correct.

Q

You are not saying that it undo the segregated

25
26

1

school system that existed in this community up until a few

2

years ago.
A

3

The answer is that the presumption of the Act

4

1 think is that it takes at least five years, perhaps longer.

5

Now it is true that the Act only looks back to the preceding

6

five years but if an effect which dates back 20, 30 or 40

7

years is still effective and is still operative five years

8

before the suit is filed, no matter when that suit is filed,

9

then exemption is not proper.
Q

10

Well a five-year period I should simply suggest

11

is not going to repair the situation, the situation pointed

12

out by the court here.

13

whether or not the Court properly understood the Congressional

14

intent.

15
16
17
18

A

It at least raises questions ;as to

After five years have elapsed and if the tests

have not been used in the interim, it is true that the sub­
division is entitled to exemption, even though they may be
independent of cause for concern that the effects of an old

19

discrimination in education may still be operative.

20

raise a question under the Fifteenth Amendment, quite independen t

2!
22

23
24

25

That would

of the Voting Rights Act, but they are all differences between
merely having the literacy tests suspended and coming out from
under the Act.
You can come out from under the Act and be free to
enact new laws. Section 5 of the

Act which this court dealt

with recently is not operative in that circumstance, nor can
27

1

Federal examiners or Federal observers be sent down to the

2

county.

3

So there is some point in winning exemption even if

4

you cannot reinstitute literacy tests which for independent,,

5

Fifteenth Amendment reasons would not be permissible*
Q

Are you familiar with the situation in Wake

e

A

Wake County is some embarrassment to us„

9

As I understand it the investigations of the

6

7

County?

10

Department of Justice did not reveal in Wake County as they did

11

here, a wholesale or very common waiver of literacy tests for

12

whites but not for Negroes.

S3

That ground of objection was apparently not available

14

or so our investigation disclosed in Wake County.

15

as I know was there there any question of whether municipali­

16
17

Nor, so far

ties had existed under a different regime than the county
authorities, voting authorities.

13

On the other hand, educational disparities were

19

probably comparable and on that ground it may be that the

20

Attorney General might have had equal cause to object to the

21

suit filed by Wake County.

22

Q

When the Attorney General does enter into a

23

consent judgment with the county, does he also enter into

24

consent judgments with each municipality within the county?

25

A

No, it is our view that the municipalities are
28
I

*

covered automatically because they are within the territor'/

2

which is involved.

22

Q

They have separate elections and separate

ejection officials?
A

They have separate elections and separate

election officials, but, of course, when a State is covered
as a whole, the counties and municipalities are separately
certified even though they have separate elections and separate
election officials.
They become subject to the Act because the principle
of the Act is that the greater includes the less and that
principle is operative here with respect to municipalities
within the physical territory of the county.
Now in three respects it seems to us that to Gaston
County has failed to meet its burden of proof, has failed to
convince us that the effect of the literacy test insofar as it
discriminated against white vote has ended.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:
MR. CLAIBORNE.

Finish your statement.

Those three respects in which it seems

to us that there has been a failure of proof by Gaston County
or to outline them briefly, the failure to make any showing
with respect to lack of discrimination in municipal elections
the evidence showing the waiver of the literacy test for whites

23

on a wholesale basis whereas the same did not occur for
24

Negroes, and finally the inevitable, unavoidable discrimination
25

that results in applying a literacy tests to two groups who

2

had vastly different educational opportunities»
