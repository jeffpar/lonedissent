ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. RICHARDS:

No. 453, John McMillan

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.

20

My name is Dean Richards of Indianapolis, Indiana.

11

Because the facts

22

25

of this case can be summarized

easily'I will begin with a brief summary.

The Petitioner was

convicted of a crime in the Western District of Kentucky Federal
Court.
Immediately after the jury returned its verdict and
without pause or recess the Court ordered- the Petitioner before
;
the Bench. The Court asked if the Petitioner had any comment
to make and after a brief response the Petitioner, then quiet,
at this time the Court started to make final .disposition of the
case and at this time defense counsel asked that a Pre-sentence
Investigation be made.
The Court interrupting counsel stated that a Pre­
sentence Investigation had been made, it. was before him and he
had read it and then the Court pronounced sentence.
This was complained of in a direct appeal to the
2

'3

Sixth Circuit and the findings and holdings in the Sixth

2

Circuit were:

3

from the facts that the District Judge had seen the Pre­

4

sentence Investigation Report prior to the time that the jury

5

had returned its verdict and the District Judge sentenced the

6

defendant immediately thereafter.

7

That there was no basis for inferring prejudice

Counsel upon noting,that in a Seventh Circuit Court

8

of Appeals case, Calland versus the United States, and a similar

9

case in fact the. Court held just the opposite in that in the

10

Sejventh Circuit case the Court stated that the facts in the

11

record before us

12

from an apparent violation of Rule 32{c){l).

13

0

effectively rebut the presumption of prejudice

Well, Mr. Richards, as a matter of fact, there

14

is nothing in this record to show that the Judge saw it while

15

the jury was out is there?

16

17
18
19

20
21
22
23
24
25

A

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals had a set of

facts presented to them.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals

stated that there is nothing to, no basis for inferring
prejudice from the facts that the District Judge had seen the _
Presentence Investigation.
Q

Well, I am familiar with that statement, but

where in any record is there anything showing that he saw it
while the jury was out?
A

The jury returned its verdict»

was in the Court room.

The defendant

The Trial Judge was on the Bench,
3

The

1

Petitioner was asked to come immediately before the Bench.

2

There was no pause and no recess.

3

he had any response.

4

started to dispose of the case.

5
6

Q

He made a response and then the Judge

Wellp did the Judge say that I read this while

the jury was out?

7

A

8

Q

9

The defendant was asked if

No.
Did anybody see him read it while the jury was

out?

10

A

Did anyone?

11

Q

Yes, sir.

12

A

There is no record on this.

13

Q

Well, where does theCourt,

of Appeals get the

14

fact and I emphasise fact that the Judge read it while the jury

15

was out?

16

A

Because ——

17

Q

Where is the fact?

113

A

19

Q

21

conclusion.

22

A

24
25

When would

the Judge have had time to have read it?

20

23

The fact would be the time element.

Q

Well, that is not a fact is it?

Conclusion.

That is a

But when ——

But there is nothing in the record to show that

he read it before?
A

Well, the question here is not whether he had
4

1

seen it but whether the Judge was in receipt of the Presentence

2

Investigation.

3

Q

Well, when did ha receive it?

4

A

It would be our conclusion that he had to receive

5

it and be in receipt of the Presentence Investigation before

6

the jury returned its verdict.

7

Mow, upon nothing this conflict between the Seventh

3

Circuit that there is a presumption of prejudice, where there

9

is a violation of Rule 32(c)(1) by premature reading, of a

10

Presentence Report, the the Sixth Circuit holding there is no

11

significance in a trial Judge reading a Presentence Investiga­

12

tion prematurely, unless also it was in the record showing

13

some violation that was actual!?/ harmful to the defendant.
The Petitioner then filed application for writ of

14
13

certiorari noting the Points*

16

between the Seventh Circuit and the Sixth Circuit; Two, that
why this Court should not exercise its supervisory powers over

17

The Federal system of criminal justice to invoke Rule 32(c)(1);

13
19

20

One, that there was a conflict

! and, also, to prohibit further the taking of Presentence
j Investigations before a determination of guilt had been made by
a defendant or the defendant has plead guilty in the absence

21

of an intelligent consent,

22

Q

23

That is what the rule says, isn't it?

Your

report shall net be submitted to the Court unless defendant

24

has pleaded guilty or has been found guilty,

25

5
.

1

A

That is correcto

2

Q

I gather your argument is, in this instance, it

3

was clear since the judge said he had it that, somehow it had

4

been submitted to him before the jury returned its verdict?

5

6
7
8

9
10

A

That is right»

That he was in receipt of the

Q

If the rule means what it says then obviously

report.

the court below was wrong, wasn't it?
A

That is correct.

There was an apparent violation.

Now, the stated exactly what position we have in view

n

of the Solicitor General's brief 1 think it is appropriate to

12

state very briefly what this appeal is not.

13
14
15

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

In our petition for writ of certiorari no constitu­
tional provisions were invoked.

No mention was ever made of the

United States Constitution,
In the Solicitor General's brief, however, a very
substantial effort was made to characterize our case as a due
process case and then argue it on the harmless err versus
prejudicial error from a substitute standpoint.
In our brief on ;.fcs merits no constitutional provisions
were invoked, nor was the United States Constitution mentioned.
Likewise, it should be noted that in the granting of the writ
of certiorari no constitutional provisions were mentioned.
The Solicitor General's brief has made much of the
fact that the petitioner has not demonstrated actual prejudice
6

1

to himself resulting from this apparent violation of Rule

2

32(c) Cl).
Q

3

Well, then again

suppose if you are going to

4

require a showing of prejudice you are requiring something the

5

rule doesn't require?

6

A

That is correct.,

The Sixth Circuit places upon

7

the petitioner an almost irrebuttable presumption of non­

8

prejudice when a trial judge prematurely reads a Presentence

9

Investigation„
Q

10
11

I suppose the rule was written as it was with

some definite objective in mind, wasn't it?
A

Yes o

3

Q

And what was it?

4

A

Well, our feeling that why it should not be

12

5
6
7
8
ID

submitted to the Court would be possible prejudice to the
defendant and I also along with this I argue that the rule also
states that a Presentence Investigation should not be made
before a conviction or a plea of guilty unless there is
intelligent consent.
A Presentence Investigation can be very helpful to

20
2

the Defendant in granting probation if he is convicted.
Nov. , in the present case there was no consent by Gregg

22
23
24

He did not know a Presentence Investigation had been made of
him.
Q

That is not really before us as I recall you

25

?

1

argued that at great length»

2

Presentence Investigation might be made without petitioner11 s

3

consent, before a guilty plea or finding of guilt is not really

4

presented by this casa, is it?
A

5

That question on whether the

That is correct that this writ of certiorari

6

was granted upon facts concerning Rule 32(c)(1) and because it

7

manifests social importance I did add it in my brief»

a
9

Q

But is it really anything for us to decide

beyond whether the rule is going to be enforced as written?

10

A

Yes.

11

Q

If it is a prophylactic rule whether or not there

12

is prejudice I suppose is unimportant.

13

of the rule it means what it says, then what happened here was

14

wrong„

15
16

17
18
19
20

21
22
23
24
25

A

That is correct.

If under the language

The prejudice that we are

speaking of here is not prejudice to the defendant5s substantial
or substantive rights.
Q

I don't even see why you talk about prejudice.

If your position is that the rule should be enforced as written
why isn't that the end of your case?
A

Because we have mentioned it in our case because

the Solicitor General's brief, in response to our brief has
tried to make a question of this as to why I am mentioning it
before the court now.
Are we prejudiced to the Federal rules?
8

The Federal

1

rules of criminal procedure are mandatory or they are advisory.
Q

Mr., Richards, what do you want us to give, a

4

A

Yes.

5

Q

A new trial?

8

A

Yes.

7

Q

How did this affect the jury's verdict?

8

A

I feel that

9

Q

How, how did this, the jury didn't see this,

A

They did not.

Q

The Presentencereport?

A

They did not.

Q

Well, how did this affect the jury's verdict?

A

Because, it could have affected the Trial Court's

2
3

10

new trial?

did it?

11

12
13

14
15
16

17

handling of the trial.

20

Q

23

If you say yes, I am going to ask you where

| do you get it from.
A
trial.

I do not know when the Judge had it before the

He announced after the verdict was returned that he had

it in his possession and that he had already read it.
Q

24
25

Are you arguing to us that the Judge had it

I before the trial?

21

22

that it was there, but from the

record I cannot make a --■ -

18
19

1 feel

Because the judge, according to you, violated

the rule?
9

1

A

Yes o

2

Q

The maxi is entitled to a whole brand new trial?

3

A

Yes .

4

Q

Well, he could still be tried on the same

5

indictment, I hope»

8

A

That is correct»

7

Q

Thank you»

3

A

The rules, if they are advisory, the Defendant

9

Gregg has no standing»

If they are mandatory, then certain

10

rules, based upon constitutional considerations, can be in due

1!

course enforced by due process considerations»
But the rest of the rules, how can they be enforced?

12

13
14
13
16

17
18
19
20

21
22
23
24
25

They can only be enforced by this court using its supervisory
powers on strict enforcement of the Federal Rules of Criminal
P rocedure»
Q

Wasn't it physically possible for the Judge to

have read* to have seen and read the report after the jury came
in and returned its verdict?
A

Well, we are contending no»

Q

Why?

A

A Presentence Investigation is generally a

lengthy document»
Q

How long was it?

A

X have not seen the Presentence Investigation

im that there has not been a court order to let counsel read
10

1
2
3

4

‘the Presentence Investigation.
Q

Well, why do you s&y he couldn91 have read it?

It might have bean a page, might it not?
A

Well, this is very possible but the jury with

5

the petitioner in the room, the trial judge in the room, the

6

jury walked back into the courtroom, and then it returned its

7

verdict and at this time the trial judge asked the defendant

3

to approach the bench and asked if he had any response.

9

Then he made a response, then the judge started to

10

pronounce sentence and then defense counsel asked that a Pre~

11

sentence Investigation be made.

12

Then the» trial judge stated a Presentence Investigation

13

has been made, I have read it, and it is before me now.

Then

14

he read from a small portion of the Presentence Investigation.

15

Q

Then it was right before his eyes?

16

A

Yes.

17

Q

Was the jury polled?

18

A

Yes.

19

At this time whan the jury returned its verdict --

20

Q

21

22
23
24
25

It was there on the bench at this time.

Do you think the judge could have read the

report during that time?
A

Your Honor?

Q

Do you think the judge could have read the

report during that, times?
A

Well, the judge at this time was polling the jury
11

1

And when the jury was polled then there was a comment con­

2

cerning when they were to return to further jury duty and at

3

that
Q

4

5

Did the judge poll the jury in this case or the

clerk?

6

A

The judge, 1 believe, asked counsel if —

7

Q

Uh huh (no), the judge himself says by the

8

court, "I will ask each individual juror if that is your

3

verdict"which I suppose means the judge himself polled them»

10

A

That is correcto

Then without pause, without

11

recess, the defendant was called before the bench.

12

when the petitioner found that a Presenfcenc® Investigation had

13

been made without petitioners consent and the petitioner was

14

asked to respond if he had anything to say for himself not

15
16
17
18

19
20
21
22
23
24

25

This is

knowing that a Presentence Investigation had been made.
In Smith versus United States Justice Clark in two
concurring opinions, two concurring justice, in a separate
opinion of that case said that there is a presumption of
prejudice when there is an apparent violation of of Rule 32(c)Cl)
and he further, Justice Clark made it clear that the presump­
tion of prejudice that he wrote was reached without due process
considerations„
His considerations were strictly procedural.

And

that the Court through its powers of supervision over the
exercise of power of supervision of the Federal system of
12

1

criminal justice should grant a new trial in this matter..,

2

Now, the question before us is whether the conduct of

3

the trial judge and the conduct of the probation officer in

4

this case constitutes such a procedural, not constitutional,

5

but procedural irregularity as to require an exercise of

6

supervisory powers of this court.

7

Power of the Federal rules of criminal procedure

8

says you are going to be enforced if the defendant does not

9

enforce it.

The Government certainly will not.

The rules

10

will not

be enforced unless you would give him some type of

11

a bounty

to enforce the rules.

12

Give him a newtrial.

If he is not given a new trial then why would a

13

petitioner ever want to seek his appellant relief if there is

14

a violation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
Q

15
16

I gather a resentence in this case is meaningless

because this is a mandatory sentence, isn't it?

17

A

That is correct.

?8

Q

Twenty-five years?

19

A

Yes.

20

QI mean in this case, I gather one of

your argu­

21

ments is

that it is not enough just to send it back for

22

resentence is because the judge is powerless to give him

23

anything less than 25 years.

Is that right?

24

A

That is correct.

25

If this case is remanded back for resentencing then
13

1

we still have

2

Q

How come they can put him on probation?

3

A

He has an alternative decision, probation or

4
5
6

mandatory 25 year sentence with no possibility of parole,
Q

Oh, well then it could be, it could be a re­

sentence procedure.

Is that it here?

7

A

Mo,

8

0

Why?

9

A

It could be but that

10

Q

When he got this mandatory 25 years?

11

A

That is correct.

VI

0

But on resentence it might be that he will get

13

probation, is it not?

14

A

The District Judge has read the Presentence

15

Investigation and a Presentence Investigation was made without

16

even an interview made of the defendant.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

Q

But, isn’t your argument that the purpose of

this rule is to prevent the trier, the judge, presiding judge evci n
with the jury from becoming prejudiced against the defendant
by reading the Presentence Report?
A

The petitioner is speaking of prejudice to the

Federal rules»
Q

This is sort of an arrid principle?

A

That is correct»

Procedural irregularities»

Advisory or mandatory.

14

1

Q

Would you say that we not only, that it isn't

2

because of possible prejudice against the defendant during the

3

trial that you want a new trial?

4

A

5

0

No,

That is correct»

6

Just because as a deterrent, as a remedy,, as
!
a remediati matter you order a new trial to make judges obey

7

the rules?
A

8
9

That is correct.

That is our contention.

We

argue that we did not have a due process contention before this

10

court.

We are asking the court to exercise its supervisory

II

power and enforce the Federal rules.

12

Q

And you don't suggest there was any prejudice?

13

A

les, I feel that there is prejudice.

14

Q

1 mean prejudice to the defendant in any

IS

concrete way.

16

A

Yes.

17

Q

In having looked at the report?

A

Yes, I do.

You don't have a right to look at it.

I understand that.

Would you say there is a likelihood of

prejudice in this case?
A

I feel that there is prejudice,

I feel that

there is prejudice,

7

Q

What is it?

8

A

Well, the prejudice would be from the record such

9

as the courts not letting the defendant have instruction unless

10

you include defense, the undue haste in which this trial was

11

given or was directed through, now allowing -—-

Was there a competency hearing in this case?

25

A premental examination was made of the

defendant to determine whether he was competent to stand trial
and that report was submitted to the court.
Q

What did that have in it?

A

What did that have in it?

Q

Yes.

A

It had part of the defendant's past criminal

background„
Q

It had his education, his mental problems, his ——
Do you suppose it had as much in it as the

Pxesentenca Report?
A

It could have but I presume the premental

examination report would be only used for the purpose of
determining whether the petitioner was competent to stand trial,
16

?

not to be used to determine whether the petitioner should be

2

given probation or should be given a 25-year mandatory sentence,

3

Q

Well, I must say from what the Court revealed.

4

about the Presentence Investigation, the report contained, at

5

page 7, it was quite a lengthy report»

6

A

Yes, it was»

7

Q

He certainly had quite a record, didnat he?

3

A

Yes o

9

Q

Juvenile record, 1960, an aiatomobile^ stolen

automobile, parole in s65, paroled in '62, parole violator in

12

several warrants now against him.

13

A

That is correct»

14

It is a pretty long report»

That

We are stating that there is

That who is going to enforce Federal

rules of criminal procedure.

Why would a defendant seek his

appellant remedies unless he could get a new trial if a Federal
rule is violated during the course of his trial?
Or if he would only be given a resentence, we are
arguing that the Federal rules should be made mandatory and if
there is a violation, such as a violation of Rule 32(c) Cl) that
the defendant should be given a new trial.
17

1

Q

Well, suppose in this case that the Pre-trial

2

Investigation, mental capacity, showed every fact from the

3

beginning to the end and every word in the same language that

4

was shown in the Presentence Report, would you still say that

5

the case should be reversed?

Investigation.
Q

3
9
10

I do not know what was in the Presentence

1 know you don't, but you were saying it should

be automatically reversed.

But would you say it if it had all

been read in a proper report?
A

11

Yes, because our appeal is based on prejudice

12

not to the defendant but prejudice to the Federal

13

Criminal Procedure.

Rules of

Q

Well, maybe the rules don't have a right to

That is correct,

20

Q

Prejudice done to the Federal rules.

21

That is the appeal.

22

A

23

Q

I thought it was the appeal of the defendant?

A

That is correct, but the defendant has asked that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY M. GLAZER, ESQ.

14

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. GLAZER.;

15
16
17

Do you think

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

court.
The Court of Appeals decided this case and petifloners

18

argument rests upon the assumption that the District Judge saw

19

the report, probation report prior to the time the jury returned

20

its verdict.

21

While we believe strenuously this assumption is not

22

supported by the record and that this assumption developed from

23

the manner in which the issue was presented below, it is also

24

our position that there is no occasion to set aside this con­

25

viction even if the trial judge saw the report prematurely.
21

3

We reach this conclusion because it affirmatively

1

2.

appears in this record that petitioner would not have been

3

prejudiced either by the jury9s determination of guilt or by

4

any of the court's ruling by the — a premature examination

5

of the probation report.,

6

Q

Excuse me, Mr. Glaser, may I ask you the question

I asked Mr. Richards.

When did this rule take its present form?

1948.

has pleaded, guilty or has been found guilty.

14

sentence been there?

How long has that

15

A

It has been that way since 1948.

16

Q

I see, thanks.

A

Petitioner has pointed out that the record shows

17

18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

that immediately following the verdict the jury was polled,
the defendant was called forward for sentencing and the court
advised him of the mandatory 25-year sentence v;hich the statute
imposes for the robbery of a postal station when lives are
placed in jeopardy by a dangerous weapon.
At that point the court asked defense counsel and
defendant if they had anything to say before sentence was
pronounced.
22

1

Defensa counsel then requested a delay in sentencing t o

2

■the following week to enable petitioner to spend a few more days

3

with his family.
When the court indicated that such a stay would not

4
5

be granted the defense counsel asked for a Presentence Report.

6

The court at this point replied that a Presentence Investigation

7

had been made and it is before me now.

The court thereupon sentenced the defendant to the

8
9

I have read it.

mandatory 25-year sentence.

io

Q

How long did all of that take, how many minutes?

ii

A

The record doesn't reflect how long that took,

12

your Honor.
Q

13
14

a time between 3s30 and 3s36.

25

I understood something in the briefs that it was

A

Well, that is right.

Q

Now that is six minutes for all of this to

happen and for the judge to review the Presentence Report, and
so forth?
A

In the circumstances of this case, considering

the options that the judge had, the judge could have scanned
the probation report during the time of sentencing.
0

You are certain that the judge could have looked

at this probation report during this time?
A

Yes, your Honor, he could have looked at it.

Q

Let me ask you one question before you get so
23

1

certain.

2

How long was the probation report?
A

The probation report has been logged with the

3

Clerk's Office,

We wrote a letter to the probation officer and

4

asked him to send the report to the Clerk of This Court.

5

Q

How long is the report?

6

A

The report is four pages long.

7

Q

Four pages long and it took six minutes?

8

A

Right.

9

Q

Now that would be about, what, it might take

10

six minutes to read four pages,
A

1!

Well, if the judge had said, "I am reading the

12

report" or "I have scanned it" we wouldn't have a lawsuit here.

13

Now he said, "I have read it."
Q

14

have read it within this six minute period according to you?
A

18

24
25

Now he said, "I have read it,” which means 1

This is a situation a he could have read it,

speed read it, during the six minute period considering the
fact --Q

Is there anything in the record to show the judge

had taken speed reading?
A

No, your Honor,

Q

Well, my point is that seriously it appears to

be that in this six minute period he should have been listening
to what defense counsel was arguing and he didn't do if.

For

his client, he should have been listening to what the defendant
24

:

1

2

said, yet he used six minutes in reading this four-page document
A

In the first place all defense counsel said

3

during this period is, "X want a stay until Monday morning

4

because my client is facing a long sentence and I would like

5

him to spend the last few days with his family."

6

Q

'He also read that his wife was pregnant and

other things and other items in there -A

Right, and it would be very simple for the

District Judge to just scan the report, because this is not a

10

— this is a case where the District Judge was familiar with

11

the defendant's background.

12

Six weeks earlier he had a psychiatric report which

13

detailed the defendants prior record, detailed the defendant's

14

prior psychological and psychiatric problems.

Do you mean by such things that he could x^ipe

out the necessity of seeing the report, the probation report?
A

NO,,

Q

And decided on those things and not in accordance

with the report?
A

No, it seems to me your Honor, that once you

have a probation report in the case, and once the issue of
competency is in a lawsuit, the judge cannot divorce that issue
from his mind throughout the lav/suit, because -—
Q

But should he be prejudiced by it if there is

anything good in the probation report?
25

3

A

Should he be prejudiced by it?

2

Q

Yes.

3

A

There is no indication he was prejudiced by it,

Do you suppose he decided on that or is this

probation report supposed to have some significance?
A

13

The probation report has significance but in

12

this situation what did the judge have to decide upon sen­

13

tencing?

14

to impose any sentence tap to 25 years.

15

were two,, either place this man on probation or give him the

16

mandatory 25-year sentence,

This is not a case where he had the right to decide
He had — hos options

Now, tills man had been also? and this came out in the
evidence in the case as well as in the psychiatric report, had
been the week following the date that this crime was committed
had been arrested for bank robbery in another state.
And that case was also pending in the Federal court.
And the judge, therefore, knew that he either had to put him
on probation or sentence him to 25 years.
The facts of this crime were such that the defendant
her® with a companion went into a postal substation, tied and
26

1

gagged two women, put a gun to one woman's head and threatened

2

to blow her brains out.

3

Now, in these circumstances the judge doesn't have to

4

study every single word of the Probation Report to realize he

5

is not going to put the man on probation.

6

study every single word to decide what should I give him, five

7

years or twenty^five years.

He doesn't have to

8

His options are either 25 years or probation and it

9

seems to me this is the type of case where he could just scan

10

the report and on the basis of that decide that this is not a

11

case for a probation and since his hands are tied by Congress,

12

to impose the 25-year mandatory sentence.

13

Q

14

A

What was the date of ferial?
What was the date of trial?

I think the date

IS

of trial was in May 1967, which was about 5 or 6 weeks after

16

arraignment.

19
20
21

24
25

Q

Hox* long did the trial last?

A

The trial lasted one day.

The evidence consisted

of tv/o women who were in the postal substation and also some
evidence concerning the defendant being arrested in a motel
with a gun and blank money orders which had been taken from
this station and also, there is also evidence that on the day
preceding on the day of the robbery, the same, the gun in which
the defendant was found in his possession was purchased in
Louisville which was the place of the robbery.
27

i

The defendant offered no evidence.

2

G

Was that all the evidence offered on either side?

A

That was all the evidence,

The defendant

Now it wasn't part of the six minutes taken up

by the judge polling the jury?
A

12

I think it was.

It

may have been.

But it

13

seems to me that the poll consisted of not asking each juror

14

individually is this your verdict but —Q

20

A

Well, you can't tell from the record,

12 jurors shook their heads affirmatively.

Whereupon all jurors indicated

18

What the judge said, nI will ask each individual

Why should you assume that?

A

Well, it may be the other way.

2,

court reporter would write it in the record and since the court

3

reporter didn't write it in the record I assumed it was the

4

other way.
Q

5

Apparently the judge had some problem as to

6

whether or not he should ask the jury to come back and that

7

took a little time in this colloquy, didn't it, out of the

8

six minutes?

9

A

It took some time.

10

Q

I mean, some of the six minutes taken up by this

11

polling of the jury and some of the six minutes taken up on

12

whether or not they were to be called back and after that was

13

done he said let the defendant come forward, I wonder how much

14

of the six minutes were left then?
A

15

Also, on the other hand, when the judge came to

16

recite the defendant's record, it seems that he is reading the

17

record at that time.

18

and he says, "It shows in 1960 this defendant stole an auto- °** •

19

20
21

mobile and given an

indeterminant youth sentence,

paroled in 1965, he

was returned." Now, itindicates

24

All he had to decide is whether I should put this man on

case, and from the defendant9s past record —

Does this six minutes we are talking about begin

Q

When was it given?

23

A

The record in this ease does not show when the

24
25

probation report was given the judge.
Q

Where do you get the six minutes from?
31

A

1

Well, the court has assumed that there is six

2

minutes on the basis of the jury — turning to the Government's

3

brief — where it says the jury returned its verdict at

4

3:24 and then that the sentencing procedure occurred at 3:30.

It is in the transcript»

That is right,

It might be possible that the judge had it while

they were arguing the case and wasn't much interested in hearing

9

the arguments,

A

Well, this record does not reflect when the

probation officer submitted the report to the judge.

I under­

stand it is the practice in this district for the probation
officer to remain in the courtroom while the jury is out and
after the jury reaches its verdict, and if the verdict is guilty,
at that time it is the common practice in this district for the
probation officer to deliver the report to the court.
Q

Is that the record?

Is that in the record?
A

The record has no indication at all.

Q

Well, why do you ask us to put it on that basis?

X am just — I am not asking, I am just saying what the practice

Q

None whatsoever»

Don’t you agree that not only is the rule that

4

it shouldn’t be given to the judge until after guilt has been

5

determined, but also isn’t it assumed that the judge is going

6

to read it, No» 1? and 2, give it his careful consideration?

7

and 3, to take mature time to think it over, even if the record

shows the man is guilty as all get~out?

9

Isn’t that why we have a probation report or is it

10

your position that the judge is given a probation report and

11

he just scans it?
A

12

13

Now which is your position?

My position is that whether a judge can ask for

a probation report or not is optional.
Q

In my case I ami talking about where the judge

Before ha

20

said he carefully read it I assume that it would take more

21

than siK minutes.

22
23
24
25

A

Well, it seems to me the judge, the amount of

time a judge should spend on a probation report, varies with
the individual case.

If he has a case of a first offender

or where he has an option of putting a first offender on
34

1

probation, X say he should spend a lot of time on the probation

2

report, perhaps ask the probation officer ——
Q

3

If he has a crime where all the witnesses on

4

one side and he doesnat take the stand, I get it you don’t

3

think there is any need for a probation report at all.

6

A

Well, I think in this case ----

7

Q

They didn’t need one.

8

A

In this case, there would be no need for a

9
10

probation report because he did not have any option as to what
sentence to impose.
This is a clear case where probation should have been

11

12

denied.

13

who shortly after —■ shortly before this crime was committed,

14

he had been released from a prior institution and had violated

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

I can't conceive of a judge placing a man on probation

parole previously.
Q

Well, why did he read it?

A

What?

Q

Well, why did he read it?

If he didn't need to

read it, why did he waste his time?
A

1 would think that one thing he would be

interested is whether the probation officer's recommendation
agrees with his.

The probation officer's recommendation agrees

with his impression of the case, then I don't think he has to
scan every line and carefully read each word,
1 think the judge, properly based on the evidence in
35

1

this case and just what he read in open court about the

2

defendant's past history*, that was enough»
Q

3

He had to do it that day, he couldn't have

4

thought it over that night, could he?

5

that day within six minutes?
A

6

He had to be sentenced

I don't see any virtue of delaying the sentencing

7

process.

If the judge is clear, that this man robbed a postal

8

station with a deadly weapon and he has been out on bond before,

9

it seems to me that the judge, and he doesn't sentence him he

10

will remain out on bond, it seeias to me that it is very reason­

11

able for the judge to sentence him on the spot and there is no

12

reason for the delay.

14

Assuming that the court was of the opinion that the

25

Mr. Glaser, let rae ask you this.

judge had this before the verdict was announced, that would be
a clear violation of the rule, would it not?
A

Clearly.

Q

Now in those circumstances, would this man be

entitled to any remedy at all?
A

I would say not in this case for this reason;

Were it affirmatively appears from the record as it does in this
case that neither defendant's trial, determination of his
guilt, the rulings of the judge, or sentence were affected in
any way by the judge obtaining the report prior to verdict,
that there is no reason to give him a new trial.
36

1

The reason I say that

2

Q

Your belief is that even though the judge has

3

clearly violated the rules, that it is still incumbent on the

4

defendant to establish that he was prejudiced thereby?

5

A

No, I would say that the Government will take

6

the burden of showing7lack of prejudice.

7

case, lack of prejudice appears beyond a reasonable doubt.

3

An examination of the probation report and the psychiatric

9

report shows that the probation report is derived principally

10

11

And 1 say in this

from the psychiatric report.
So, if the judge, the judge who was required to

12

examine the psychiatric report prior to the trial he may even

13

have had the psychiatric report in front of him during the cours e

14

of the trial.

15

Q

But do you conceive then that in a situation

16

where the judge does violate the rule, that it is incumbent upon

17

the Government to establish that there was no prejudice to him?

'18

19

20

lack of prejudice.

And we say in this case, because of the

psychiatric report, lack of prejudice is clear beyond any doubt.

Well, also, does the record show that he was

prejudiced, the judge was prejudiced?

No.

that rule must always result automatically in reversing the

He is always denied ——

No, the rule was changed in 1966.

The rule was

changed in 1966 which and it provides now the court before
imposing sentence may disclose to the defendant or his counsel
all or part of the material contained in the Presentence
Investigation.

And I say the defendant ——

Why didn't he get it here?

He didn't ask for it„

No, he never asked the District Judge to see

He didn’t ask the court —

You think he should have said, ‘’If a Presentence

It shows a dire act.

He reads briefly from it.

And

1

in one continuing sentence and in three paragraphs he goes

ahead and states briefly what the Presenters Report says in

part, and then says it will be the judgment of this court that

this defendant be sentenced to mandatory 25 years, custody of

Q

Wall, where were you cut off?

A

When I found out that a Presentence Investigation

12

had been made, that the court had read it and then the court

13

pronounced sentence.

I don't see where you were cut off.

Would you let him cut you off that way?

A

We were so surprised that the Presentence

Investigation had been made
Q

But why didn't you ask him to see it?

Q

Maybe the last paragraph of the colloquy would

court interrupting —

"COURT:

A Presentence Investigation has been made,

11

he was paroled in 862, returned as a parole violator in *65 and

was not released full time until May of last year.

He was paroled in '65, he was returned --- no —

opportunity for counsel to even to answer the court because

Q

Do you believe that a lawyer who represents his

clients from the beginning to the end would be stopped from
talking by what was said there?
Would you?

Q

Were you stopped from talking?

I certainly was not except

Did you want to see it?

Did I want to see the Presentence Investigation

at that time?

No.

The defendant turned and walked away in

7

Q

You mean after this colloquy was over?

8

A

Yes, the ■ marshal stepped forward and the

9

defendant was taken from the courtroom immediately.

Then we

to

were later brought back and he was advised of his appellate

It

rights some minutes later, 10 to 15 minutes later.

\z

I had left, got into my car and started from the

13

parking lot, then we were brought back in the courtroom and

14

advised of the appellate rights that the petitioner had.
Q

What were you going to say that you didn't get

A

At that fime I had nothing to say.

Q

Well, no, when the judge interrupted you there,

to say?

when you asked about a Presentence Investigation be made, what

20

were you going to say that you didn't get said?

21

22
23

A

I was requesting that a Presentence Investigation

be made of Mr. Gregg
Q

That is something you thought would take a little

24

time and the sentence would be put off until it was complete.

25

That is what you were after, wasn't it?
44

1

A

That is correct.

2

Q

Instead of which you discovered I gather it was

3

something you didn’t know about.

It had already been done so

4

you couldn't get a delay in sentence while the Presentence

5

Investigation was made.

6

A

That is correct.

Q

Are you sure you are not answering a leading

8

question instead of stating what you thought?

9

A

No,, your Honor. 1 don't believe I am.

10

Q

Your leading question or mine?

11

A

At this time I was not going to ask. I was only

12

asking that a Presentence Investigation be made and I was not

13

going to ask that it be disclosed to the petitioner or his

counsel.
