ARGUMENT OF PAUL T. GISH, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. GISH:

7

If

the Court please, Mr. Chief Justice,

8

I am Paul Gish, Assistant Attorney General of Alabama, represent

9

ing Warden Simpson, the petitioner in the case of Simpson

to

versus Rice.
In this case Mr. Rice was convicted in 1960 on

It
12

four separate cases of second degree burglary.

He received

25

on a plea of guilty on each case four years in one case and
two years in each of the other three cases, making a total of
10.

His plea of guilty was entered without aid of counsel,
so on post conviction, he received a new trial some two and a
half years later.

A counsel was appointed for his new trial.

He was tried, I believe, in December of 1964, I think that is
right, in two of the cases.
He was convicted by the jury and the same judge who
had passed the earlier sentence gave him 10 years on each of
those two convictions, making a total of 20.
On the third case the same judge sentenced him to
five years imprisonment.

The State prosecuting officer made
2

1

a motion to nol press the fourth case and that is what the

2:

trial judge did.

The fourth case was nol pressed»

Now, this case, if the Court please, is singular

3
4

of course to the North Carolina Pearce case.

5

were some points argued by counsel that we don't have here.

6

Because this man did receive harsher punishment, he received

7

much harsher punishment on his second trial than he did on

3

the first.

9

However, there

He not'only did that, but technically at least he

10

received no credit for the 2-1/2 years served between his

It

first convictions and his post convictions.

•\

12

Now, our position is that the trial judge had used

13

complete discretion to sentence after a judgment of guilt.

14

He used many factors, some of

15

crime itself, some of which may be connected with the man,

IS

soma of which can be connected with history of the case itself,

17

some of which, if the Court please, depends upon how much the

18

trial judge knov/s about this particular case.

which are connected with the

19

In other words, on a plea of guilty, I have seen,

20

and the record doesn't show it, but I have seen in hundreds

21

of cases in which agreements are made between the prosecuting

22

officer and — in which they will entertain a plea of guilty.

23
24
25

Q

Mr. Gish, would you suggest that among those

things that a judge takes into consideration might also be the
fact that a man who appeals and gets a reversal should be
3

1

2

punished more than a man who did not take an appeal?
A

Mr. Chief Justice, I must agree with you.

But

3

our position is that the judge who is an elected or appointed

4

official in Alabama does not have

5

legislature or prescribed by the Courts, why I am giving you

6

more punishment.

7

Q

to say, prescribed by the

How would defendant ever raise the question as

3

to whether the judge had that in his mind or not when he

9

sentenced him?

10

A

I don't see how he could, Your Honor.

1 1

Q

You don't think that would be permissible, do

12
1.3

you, to have that motive?
A

Your Honor, if I disagree with you it is because

14

I think that if there are circumstances that we don't know

15

about where vindictiveness could be shown, then we would have

16

a case where a man could show that his rights are violated

17

by a vindictive judge.

18

He did this to punish me.

But what I am saying, my position is, that the mere

19

fact that he receives, that the accused receives,•a harsher

20

punishment and in this case a much harsher punishment can

21

be and should be pointed to other sentencing factors and not

22

just vindictiveness.

23
24
25

Q

Well, here we have the same judge, the same

evidence and dismissal of one of the charges for the second
trial and still the judge gives him accumulated sentences of

4

;1

25 years instead of the 10 that he gave hirri on the first trial*

2

What more could one ask in trying to determine whether it was

3

vindictative or not.

4

A

If Your Honor please,. I agree with every part

5

of your question except where Your Honor states that it is the

0

same evidence.

1

Q

1 thought that was in the record here* that it

Q

is the same evidence.

9

A

On a plea of .guilty.

10

Q

I beg your pardon?

11

A

On a plea of guilty, as this man entered the

12

first time, in a crime of this sort, many times, no evidence

13

at all is presented to the court.

14

Q

15

A

I see.
Now we don't know who from the record whether

IQ

the judge had any help but we do know that the judge had the

17

evidence on the jury trial.
I was under the impression that there had been

13

Q

19

a trial in Eiost cases.

20

A

21

Now, let me point to a fgw things that are not in

I was wrong in that.

That is right.

22

the brief.

23

on the merits on which were not important prior to that case.

24

That have since been important in 215, 7 2d, 598 and 603.

25

In the Goolsby cases which I have in the appendix

Now, those eases decided subsequent to the second

5

1

conviction in this case hold in essence that a man in Alabama

2

cannot receive more punishment for one crime than the maximum

3

provided by statute.

4

There is no way that I know of to give a man credit in Alabama

5

on his prior conviction of the same case,

Now that is all that Alabama requires.

The legislature does not leave it to the prison

6

7

authorities.

The prison authorities receive a man with the

8

judgment and sentence of the Court.. The prison authorities

9

have no discretion as to what to do with this man except to

10

receive him and let him serve his term under the rules, good

11

time — there are two types of good time, which is the same

12

as gained time in North Carolina.
Those things are figured by the prison authorities.

13
14

Now, if I may, let me get to the record in this case.

15

appendix on Pages 55 and 56 we have as an exhibit a statement

16

by the prosecutor as to how he handles the second cases on

17

a retrial.

10

In the

19

the District Court which flatly accuses the State of Alabama

20

of increasing punishment, increasing sentences, merely for

21

punishment.

21

record except the statement on Pages 55 and 56 and the

23

statement by the petitioner below that he didn't know why he

24

served this sentence.

25

There is no evidence that that I see in this

I don't think that any convicted man could say why
6

1

the judge gave him the maximum instead of the minimum.

2

Court I think has

;3

a similar type situation involved double jeopardy.

of the higher offense.

But we submit that there is a difference between

11

with ten years on the one hand and on the second trial being

There is a case decided by the Second Court of the
Fifth Circuit reported in 403 Federal 2nd 1019 that is not
cited in any of the briefs filed here in this case.
Frankly, I cannot, from a Constitutional standpoint,
understand this case as Williams against the State of Alabama and
this case in connection with the case before this Court.
In the Williams case there were three convictions on
first trial; each sentence was for five years.

On the second

trial Mr. Williams was convicted by a jury and given ten years
in one case.

In the other two cases he was given a year and

a half, which put him, of course, in a better position the
second time than he was in the first time.
I can see that ha is in a better position.
7

However,

1

Constitutionally, if Mr, Rie© was entitled to receive only what

2

he did the first with credit for time served as the

3

Court held, then Constitutionally why wasn't Mr. Williams

4

entitled to the same treatment, except that on the whole Mr.

5

Williams got a batter deal on these cases than Mr. Rice did.

District

To me as a Constitutional point, I do not understand

6
7

that.

As a point of morality, as a point of what should be

3

done in a particular case,» I can understand.

9

Constitutional point if Mr. Rice is entitled to his years with

But as a

10

no additions, then 1 submit that Mr. Williams is entitled to

the same thing.

Q

If the State offered no witnesses, how did they

convict him?
A

This is, Mr. Justice Black, this is at the

13

District Court, the Federal District Court, in the habeas

14

corpus proceeding.

15

conclusion of the case entered his opinion-

16

of the appendix.

17

that the State of Alabama is punishing the petitioner's rights

18

for having exercised his right of post conviction review, for

19

having had the original sentences set aside.

20

But at that case Judge Johnson at the
It is on Page 69

He found that the conclusion is inescapable

We submit that as the Hon. Attorney General of the

21

State of Louisiana mentioned that this is a flagrant violation

22

of Mr. Rice's Constitutional rights.

23

time that this case is before the Court primarily because of

24

the several splits in the jurisdictions with the Patton case

25

and as to the concepts involved there.
9

We realize at the same

1
2

Court that Mr. Rice was being punished for having made this

3

appeal that our case can be supported here on the same three

4

theories as the Pcitton case.

5

Q

Mr. Lawson, may I ask a question?

6

A

Yes, sir.

7

Q

I understand that this offense of second degree

8

*

We think that beyond the finding of the District

burglary carries a maximum of 10 years.

9

A

10

Q

That is right.
Suppose there had been onlyone count

towhich

11

there had been a guilty plea and there hadbeen asentence

12

10 years that the denial of assistance to counsel didn't come

13

to light until after he had served eight years of the 10 years,,

14

if he could have served that long — could he?

13

A

Yes, sir.

16

Q

Could he have served that Tong?

A

of

Your Honor, it gets rather complicated in

13

figuring out good time and I can't say offhand it would probably

19

more in the neighborhood of six years than
Q

20

Let us take six years then.

Just before he

21

had served his six years, then he proceeds in

22

viction set aside for denial of assistance to counsel and he

23

goes to trial.

24

he could get another 10-year sentence, that he would have to

Wow do I understand that on conviction on trial

getting the con-

;
serve that six years,with good time reduced to six years, so
10

that the aggregate would be say 12 years for the; offenses

1

2

only maximum of only 10 years under the statute? is that right?
A

3

Your Honor , I think the lav/ in Alabama has been

4

changed by the Goolsby case in that regard0

S

maximum ceiling in what you can get after those two trials»

6

It cannot be above the maximum specified in the statute „

7

in this case it did occur, exactly the same situation that you

3

But

s aid, Your Honor, occurred»
In the first case-----

9

Q

10

11

It now puts a

In fact, then, Rice has to serve an aggregate

time in jail which exceeds the maximum for the offense?
A

12

In one of the offenses, that is true, not in

13

all three, because he had not entered into service of all three

14

of these cases»

15

IS
17
18
19

20
21

But on the first case he had served some tv/o

years of the four-year sentence»
±i

He was resentenced to 10 years

jail, so that basically he had received ——
Q

On how many counts?

A

Sir, that was on one case»

There were four cases originally, one was nol pressed»
As Judge Johnson mentions in here on Page 71,Judge Johnson
found that the case was not nol pressed as the State contended

22

in order to compensate the petitioner for the time that he had

23

served in the previous case, but it was done because the main

24

witness that the State had to rely on was not present»

25

Of course, we do contend, and quite seriously, that
11

1

the evidence in the record as presented to the District Court

2

is sufficient to sustain his findings — that Mr, Rice was

3

being punished for exercising his right of appeal.
\

4

You have to put this in the context of time.

5

Gideon case had been decided and later Escabito and Alabama had

6

then reinstated the old Writ of Novus as a State procedure for

7

hearing these Constitutional claims*

8

Alabama is not broad enough to hear , those.

was able to bring these things before the State Court,

Yes„ sir.

It was only after this had been done that Mr. Rice

The

Page 69, Your Honor,, of the appendixP the last

part of the second paragraph.
Also in connection with the punishment it is also
important to realise that this man was the first one of his

19

knowledge to file one of these Writs after the Gideon decision

20

in this particular county in Alabama.

21

22
23

24
25

I think the effect in this and the reason for it can
be illustrated by a case, United States District. Court case,
in which the sentencing judge who was about to release someone
on Habeas Corpus wrote in his opinion to, not just to the person,
but to all the other prisoners and he said, •'let me remind you
12

1

that it may not be a real rainbow that you see these Writs

2

that you are filing to get a fair trial.

3

rainbow there may be nothing but a pot of fool's gold."

4

Q

A pot of what?

5

A

Fool's gold.

Q

Fool's gold.

Who said this?

At the end of that

This is in a District Court case, Your Honor,

230 Fed. Supp. 601o

10

Q

Is that in your brief?

11

A

No, sir.

I just ran across it0

The point of

12

law is not important

confronted with in attempting to obtain a fair trial.

but it shows what these prisoners are

Q

What is the citation?

A

230 Fed. Supp.

607.

Q

Your basic point is the due process pointj is it?

A

My basic point to begin with goes really beyond

due process
Q

—
What are they?

Is that the most you can say

for them is that they are fundamental concepts?
A

I can go back to Chambers versus Florida —

Q

What Constitutional

A

It would have to be due process.

Here you have

a person of being comricted of something that is, in effect,
not a crime.

The only thing that he did was to appeal, a right
13

i

2

which the State had given him, and it was for that that the
District found that he was punished*

3

Q

For the Constitutional right to appeal?

4

A

You have never held that he has a Constitutional

3

right to appeal but this Court has indicated that perhaps the

6

States must provide at least one means of reviewing Federal

7

question0

a
9

Q

Why can't you approach it as just a burden on

tie other Constitutional rights that he would be urging on appeal &

10

A

The unconstitutionality ~—

11

Q

That is a condition necessarily of due process„

12

A

Well, due process because only in our view of

13

the case based at this point on the District Court's findings,

14

Your Honor, and we have got two different views:

15

Court punished him for something that was not a crime that

IS

is we say not due process *

17

But if the Court was not punishing him for a crime, we think

18

then that we can go back to Patton and to the basic concept

19

developed in that case and support our position -~-

1, if the

That is not law in any county*

20

Q

They went on three grounds*

21

A

Yes, sir*

22

Q

We want to know which one you are going on,

23

A

We urge all three, Your Honor*

24

Q

Do you see an equal protection?

25

A

Yes, sir, I see a very keen issue of equal
14

1

protection.

2

£>r the time served9 and take it one step further and suppose

3

that he had been on appeal instead of in jail exercising "this

4

by right of versiformis novus.

5

Let us first take it as to the denial of credit

The reason for this is in Alabama you have t> go by

S

versiformus novus after your appeal time has run out. But if he

7

had been appealing he would be denied the equal protection
rs
' W

.

a

that those people have who have the money to get '-out on bpnd,

9

They don't spend any time in jail.

The time that the other

10

people serve who do not appeal, every minute

11

their sentence.
But it is only this class, this class that is

12

13

14

is credited to

d efined one way, and that is a class of people who have been
denied a fair trial, a Constitutionally fair trial —~

15

Q

Didn't this case come up on Federal Habeas?

IQ

A

yes, sir,

17

Q

Well, now he hasn't been out on bail while he

18

was serving his sentence —
A

19

No, no,

I was making a statement, Your Honor,

20

that the logic in this case becomes more keen when you look at

21

it

22

Q

23

case isn't this case.

24

A

2.5

I know, but that isn't this case.

Some other

We are talking about this case,

Yes, sir,

Well, in this case you still have

people who are in jail under sentence of law who are serving
15

1

their sentences and they are receiving credit for it»

2

these people had been denied a fair trial» and who have to go

.3

back to the Court to obtain a fair trial — when I am speaking

4

in terms of due process, we are not speaking of State error ,

S

procedural error, errors in the admission of evidence that do

6

not reach Constitutional proportions»
Q

1

Only

Did 1 understand you that under Alabama law

8

before the Writ of versiformus novus was reinstated there was nc

9

way of bringing this point up?

10

A

No, sir»

11

Q

Well, then, where do you get the equal protection

12

13

argument of the wealthy man»

He couldn!fc bring it up either,

®uld he?

14

A

That is true, Your Honor»

15

Q

What happened to the equal protection argument

15
17

18
19

20
21

on this case?
A

Well, if it is a question of whether you have

to provide a forum for these people, it may be that the State
does not have to provide any method of appeal for raising
these things.

But you do get to the equal protection argument

on this particular thing when the people who are sentenced and

22

stay in jail and that includes two classes, those people who

23

are denied a fair trial but are scared to get one and those

24

people who had a fair trial and had been convicted and sentenced

25

they get credit for every minute they spend in jail.

16

Q

1

Welly I suppose your argument, too* is that

2

if on the same day, two who had pleaded guilty to second degree

3

liarglary, each got ten years, one did appeal, at the end of six

4

years he would be out, whereas this other fellow is going to

5

have to serve 12,

6

A

Yes, sir»

7

Q

So that is a denial of equal protection as

3

between prisoners merely because he sought relief from his

9

unconstitutional conviction,
r

10

A

Yes, Your Honor,

11

Q

How do they belong to the same class?

12

A

Well, it doesn't necessarily have to

be framed

1.3

as to be tried on the same day, but we are speaking of prisoners

14

15

-ir hatever the length of it is, do not have their sentences

reviewed.
It may be that that second person needed to have his

sentence increased as much as the first person.

State of Alabama believes this is unnecessary in and of itself

it can provide another means of doing it apart from taking only

Because if they had been denied the Constitutiona

right to a fair trial,they go back to seek a fair tral and the

It may be that

we have no right to classify them that way»
A

Yes, sir»

Q

It seems to me that that is a different class»

A

Well, the class that I am attempting to create

are those people serving in jail under sentence of law and
it is within that class that I am speaking»
Q

Have you considered what the effect of this

would be in California?

18

1

A

No, sir, I have notc

I am familiar with the

2

California decision of Henderson and People versus Alley to

3

support our contentions here in this Court»

4

vith what you speak of,

5

Q

But I am not famili

Suppose the State laws provided that the Court

6

merely sentences the convicted defendant let us say to one

7

par to life and then there is an authority that determines hox^

8

1 ong he shall serve, makes that determination and redeterminatic:

9

from time to time within that very broad charter and the man

to

takes an appeal, the conviction is reversed, retried, again

11

sentenced from one year to life»

12

Then would the doctrine for which you contend be

13

binding upon the administrative agency in the respect that,

14

they could not thereafter compel a man to serve more time than

15

the last time they had fixed prior to his appeal?

15

carry it that far, in other words?

Well, sir, 1 might9

Would you

I am not really familiar

enough to know how that works but that is the idea that 1 have
in mind of what the State could resort to if they, felt that
these constant reviews1 sentences were necessary»
If you have this constant re-view of sentences,
administratively perhaps, it becomes very little reason for
having it done by the Court»

In fact if you look at the

public, I mean —
Q

Except I am suggesting that maybe the principle

19

f

for which you contend would operata to restrict the discretionary

2

power of the authority in the sense that after a successful

3

appeal and reconviction, I am asking as to whether in that

4

case after a successful appeal and conviction in the second

S

trial you would say that this principle should apply to the

6

administrative authority, namely,that they can’t keep a fellow

7

in custody any longer than the last ruling prior to his appeal

3

provided®
A

9

It could have that effect but I think it would

W

not have that effect under the equal protection argument, Your

it

Honor «
It might have an effect under the due process or

12
13

the double jeopardy argument that we make®
Q

14

I am not suggesting that would be the result

15

but I am suggesting that that is a problem®

16

as a consequence of the doctrine for which you are here

17

arguing®

1

It might follow

I have already touched on, I believe, due process

19

and the equal protection argumento

20

argument we can attack in two concepts, really•

21

Our double jeopardy

One, you can carry forward this fictitious void

22

doctrine that began in Stroud and some of the earlier cases9

23

as the Court did in Green»

24

there was an implied acquittal of the first degree murder

25

sentence when he was sentenced to second degree murder»

In that case the Court held that

20

We

1

think that there is very little reason that it should not be

2

carried all the way forward as it was done in California»

3

The only argument made by the State in this case

4

has been that this was on a plea of guilty and because of that

3

that the State ought to have a second chance to look at it if

6

the man decides to appeal»

1!
12

13
14

IS
IS
17
10

10
20
21

But I think we have to carry it a little further and
realise it was on a plea of guilty when he was without counsel»
At that time the State's Attorney has. a duty owing to the State
to see that he does not make an agreement that will require
so small a time

in jail that the State would be jeopardised»

If the State's Attorney makes the agreement and it is
adopted by the Court that it may well,, it should represent what
t he State is going to require out of this crime»

We see no

reason that the State should have a second chance to look at
this man, only this man, not the others who may need their
sentences reviewed just as much»
The other viewpoint of double jeopardy is the multiple
punishment angle and this began in the case of Ex parte Lange
some years ago and that, is to look at double jeopardy as being
more than one concept but having three different parts to it,
retrial after conviction, retrial after acquittal and multiple
punishment for the same offense»
It may be that when this man appealed that he waived
his right against a double jeopardy not to be retried, but that

21

1

does not mean that he necessarily waived his right to have

2

that particular sentence fixed against him*

3

I think that a lot of these arguments that we have

4

made eippear in Professor Vein Alstein’s article in the Yale Law

5

Review and 1 would like to give some credit to him because he

6

probably should be the one before the Court today making the

7

arguments in these cases*

8
9

Q

Mr* Lawson, the Court of Appeals here adopted

as its own the opinion of District Judge Johnson*

10

A

Yes, sir*

11

Q

Of course Judge Johnson decided in your favor*

12

A

He did*

13

Q

In doing so, however, he made very explicit that

14

he did not believe that it is Constitutionally impermissible

IS

to impose a harsher sentence upon retrial if there is recorded

16

In the Court’s record some legal justification for it and I

17

am quoting an opinion.

13

First of all, I ara sure you are not going to look

19

at a gift horse in the mouth, so you don’t need to say whether

20

or not you agree, but if he is correct about that, then this

21

means that he has rejected any claim that this would violate

22

the double jeopardy guarantee? does it not?

23
24

25

A

Yes, sir*

He did not rest his opinion on

double jeopardy*
Q

And he could not have if he said it is
22

1

Constitutionally permissible as he did under such circumstances

2

to impose a harsher sentence.
A

3
4

Yes, sir, I agree.

I agree with the language

of the District Court as to your interpretation of it, Your
j.

3
S

Honor.

I don't necessarily agree that the judge should have

stopped at that point.^ .
Q

7
0
9

then that means that your double jeopardy argument cannot
prevail; does it not?
A

10

13

That is true, sir.

I think that there are three views that have been

11
12

If the District Court, is right in that statement

expounded by the District Court.

One takes the view that there

can be no increase at all, that is the Patton case.
Another takes the view that there can be increase

14

under justifiable circuitstances which appear in the record.
IS
That was the lower court case in the instant case and also
IS
the lower court in the Patton case.
17
The Marano case takes a position that there can be
18

an increase for reasons appearing, I believe, for things that
ID
lave occurred after the first sentence.

Another viex-? is

20

expressed that it can be for reasons not that have occurred
21

since the first sentence but for reasons in connection with
22
the crime itself.
23
We believe that the simple solution is to have no
24
increase.
25
23

1

Q

Is there another possible view that if the

,2

second Sentence is within the statutory maximum that really all

3

he is entitled to is to be sure to get credit on time already

4

served?
A

3

Your Honor, that view of the statutory maximum

6

has bothered me considerably because it flies right in the

1

face of the only doctrine that the Courts rely on and that is

8

that the case is void for all reasons,,
7

Q

9

What we are talking about here is what the

Federal Constitution imposes in the way of a restraint in this

circumstance on a new sentence? isn't that what we are talking

about?

A

Focusing on that if he

actually he

sought

to have the first conviction set aside in the hopes that on

new trial he

would be acquitted, I take it®

17

A

Yasf sir®

13

Q

If that is the chance he wants to take and he

10

failed and the sentence is within the statutory limit on the

20

new sentence, does he really have any justification for asking

21

for more than insistence that he gets credit for time already

22

served on the first conviction?

23

A

Yes, sir, I think he does®

Isn't that another possible view of this problem?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL T, GISH, JR., ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

4
MR. GISHs

3

If the Court please, the accused in this

6

case received on second trial a total of 25 years.

7

sentence on three indictments for burglary in second degree is

8

30 years.

9

man has received more than the maximum allowed by Alabama

10

His maximum

I do not think we have any question here that this

s tatute.
On his first 1960 convictions he received 10 years

11

12

and a maximum term of 40.

On the second trial he received

13

25 years and a maximum term of 30.

14

Q

Plus the time he had already served.

15

A

Two and a half years.

Q

Yes.

A

It would be 27-1/2 years.

Q

Is it true that this is the first collateral

13

17
13
19

20

attack upon a conviction in your State under the rule of Gideon
against Wainwright?
A

No, sir, not in my State.

23

Q „

The petitioner alleged that it was.

24

A

The petitioner said it was at the evidentiary

21

22

25

It may be in this

county.

hearing,

I do not know whether it is correct or not.
25

Q

1

Of course he wouldn’t have tha records available

2

to him, I presume»

In the record there is uncortradieted

3

testimony at least that this was the first attack upon a

4

conviction based upon this Court’s decision of Gideon against

5

Wainwright in this county of Alabama*

6

A

That is correct.

7

Q

And from that fact as well as from the State’s

8

failure to present any witnesses at the Habeas Corpus hearing*

9

perhaps from other circumstances* Judge Frank Johnson*

the

10

Federal District judge in this case* concluded as a matter of

11

fact that the reason for imposing the harsher sentence was a

12

vindictive reason of penalizing this petitioner’s on his

13

sentence?
A

14

15

IS
17
13

19

20

I do not fully understand Judge Johnson’s opinion in two or
three respects.

23
24
25

He says that he does not hold in the first

glace that the State cannot increase the sentence.

All right*

then he says that where the State does not show !’by the record
the reason for a harsher sentence then due process and equal
protection are violated'1* „
My hindsight has always been a lot better than

21
22

It may be so* Mr. Justice* let me say that

foresight.

What if I had at the time of the Habeas Corpus

hearing introduced evidence to the judge and prosecutor to
let them explain why the defendant was sentenced.
As I read Judge Johnson’s opinion even then would not
26

1

have helped my cause at that stage of the game,,
As I read the opinion he said on the record,and 1

2
3

presume the record on the second trial, must show some reason

4

why I didn't conceive of no reason other than the fact that

3

the judge had the evidence before him the second time and he

0

accepted a plea of guilty the first time.
Now would it be enough for the trial judge to st&e

7

a

in the record at the end of the trial when the jury convictss

9

“Well, this time I have heard the evidence against you.

The

to

first time you and the prosecutor entered in to an agreement

11

aid 1 ratified it by accepting your plea, but this time I know

12

more about it.

13

sentence o’5

So, therefore, I am going to give you a harsher

14

Now, would that be enough, I don’t know. I hope that

15

t he decision of this Court in this case, and in related, cases,

IS

is bound to have a tremendous effect upon the sentencing

17

policies of the trial judges all over the country.

13

But if the State cannot make its bargain in the one

19

instance and repudiate it at the same time the accused repudiate i

20

it then the sentencing policies of the trial judges in the land

21

will change.

22

Q

23

A

Yes, 1 call it a bargain?

24

Q

On a plea of guilty.

A

Yes, sir.

25

Did 1 understand you to say a bargain?

27

1

Q

Is that customary?

2

A

I have seen it happen many? many times*

3

Q

What

4

A

Judge Paul in my county*

judge tried this case?
I don’t want you to

5

understand me to say that there is any modus of a bargain as

6

we would make it the buying and selling of property*

7

merely this, that the agreement that I called a bargain would

8

be — if you leave out the fact of no attorney -- the defense

9

attorney would ask the prosecutor,

I meant

KHow much sentence can we

10

have if we plead guilty?”

sense that there might be some time before an agreement is

reached*
