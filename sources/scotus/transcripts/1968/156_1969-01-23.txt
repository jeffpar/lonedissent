MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Petitioner, versus Caribbean Mills, Inc., Respondent.

Mr. Gressman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE GRESSMAN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR. GRESSMAN:

7

8

No. 156, Clayton S. Kramer,

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
This case is here on a Writ of Certiorari to the

9
'JO

Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.

It raises the general

19

question of whether Federal diversity jurisdiction can be

12

created by a lawful assignment of a contract or a money claim

13

to a plaintiff.

14

More specifically, the question is whether the

15

assignment of a contract or a money claim is improper or

16

collusive.

17

Code where the assingment, itself, is legal under State lav;

18

where one motive for the assignment is to gain access to the

19

Federal Court by claiming diversity of citizenship as specified|

20

in Section 1332, A-2, and, thirdly, where part of the considera-

25

tion for the transaction was a percentage of the recover

22

obtained on the assigned claim.

Within the meaning of Section 1359 of the Judicial

‘

,

Q

Ultimately, this is a Federal question.

A

Yes, Your Honor, it is solely a Federal question

as to whether the Court itself has jurisdiction, or whether

2

1

it has lost jurisdiction»

2
3

Q

Well, is the meaning of the Federal statute

to be judged by Federal standards.,

4

A

S

Now, counsel has candidly conceded in the Court

Yes, Your Honor.

6

below and we repeat it to this Court, while it is not a

7

matter of the record but one of the major motives in the

8

establishment of this transaction was a desire or to create

9

the basis for invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the

10

Federal District Court.
Now, that motivation, however, has to be viewed in

11

12

light of the realities of the situation that

13

the various parties in this case.

14

respondent has sought to paint a rather bleak and sinister

15

picture of the events in this case, that I suggest are not

16

justified by the record and certainly not by the facts, as we

17

know them.

18

was confronting

Well, the brief for the

There were no sinister or secret efforts made to
;

I
19

defraud any party or to secrete any documents from the Court

20

or from anyone else.
<

21

What happened in this case, of course, as we see it,

22

is a classic illustration of a desire to avoid what one

23

of these parties, the Panama and Venezuela Finance Company,

24

viewed as prejudice in the State Courts5 to avoid that pre judici!,

25

or possibility of prejudice,is really the constitutional
3

1

res adiratae of Federal diversity jurisdiction.
The major, indeed, the sole justification that has

2
3

ever been suggested for diversity jurisdiction is to permit

4

State causes of action to be tried and heard in the Federal

5

Courts where the parties, having a choice in the matter, for

6

i
one reason or another, may fear, or, some degree or some element

7

of prejudice, may follow them if they invoke the jurisdiction

8

of the State Court rather than the Federal Court.

15

Courts than in the State Court vis-a-vis the parties of

16

that derivation?

17

A

Well, I think, first, you have to look back

18

to the original situation out of which this arose.

13

original Situation, you will recall, was essentially a contract

20

entered into

21

effect, whereby the Carribean Mills, the respondent here, agreed

22

to pay over a period of years $165,000 to Panama and Venezuela

23

Finance Company, which was also an alien corporation, having

24

been incorporated in Panama.

2

.

Panama Finance Company was faced with the situation out of

3

which this whole transaction arose, to wit, Panama could not

4

have sued Carribean Mills in the Federal Court by virtue of

5

the fact that both were aliens,

J

f

6
7

10
!1

Now, the only recourse Panama had to accord action
was to sue presumably in Haiti or in the Texas State Court.
Q

I suppose, well, apparently, the defendant

is personally present in Texas to a sufficient extent to get
personal service.
A

That is right.

It is more than that, Your Honor.

12

It is actively doing business in the State of Texas and they

13

x*aised this point and,it was decided against them, that they

14

had adequate contacts with the State to permit service in a suit,

15

in the jurisdiction of

16

Q

the

?ederal Court in Texas.

In the light of what you said, I should, perhaps,

17

change my question a little bit.

18

as to why would the Texas State Courts be more prejudiced

19

against two foreign corporations than would the Federal Court?

20

A

I still would have a question

i
Well, Your Honor, this was the practical situation

21

facing them, as I say.

22

Carribean Mills corporation, while it was technically and

23

legally a citizen of Haiti, an alien, was also owned and

24

dominated by a family in Dallas, Texas.

Finance companies, in additional to being an alien

Q

Well, are they any poorer risks in the State

A

I think they feared that, yes.

15

16

A

Yes, it was ---

The jury will be citizens of Texas, whichever

Right, but you have a broader selection in the
iA

20

Federal Court, I suppose, and 17 counties are involved, I

21

think, in the Federal Court,whereas, the State Court would

22

have been the local precinct or the city, anyway.

23

In any event, they tried —- they realized that in

24

their cwn hands

this claim wasn’t worth very much, and they

25

were actively seeking to sell this claim to various numbers of

6

i
|

1

2

persons at a discount.
1 think at one time they tried to sell it for $25,000

‘J

O

and nobody would take it.

4

an attorney in Texas, and asked him if he would be interested

5

in purchasing this, and he said, no; looking into it, he then

6

contacted another attorney, Mr. Kramer, the plaintiff in

7

this case, and asked if he would be interested in arranging

8

to take over this claim.

S

They eventually came to Mr. Banner,

Now, the respondent claims that,somehow, Mr. Banner

10

was sort of a double agent hare acting as an attorney for

11

Panama as well as for Mr. Kramer.

12

Far from that.

He has never acted,at any time, as

13

the attorney for Panama, has never received a cent from it,

14

and has treated them at arm's length at all times, so that

15

whatever connection or concern Mr. Banner had with the case

16

does not reflect upon Panama's interest or lack of interest in

17

this situation.

18

In any event, when Mr. Kramer became interested in

19

this, and purely for profit motives, frankly, the problem arose

20

as to how they could arrange a transaction that would be lawfulj

21

and that would permit adequate consideration and what-have-you

22

to be arranged.

23

Now, the testimony that Mr. Kramer gave at the trial
$165,000.

24

he very frankly said he didn't have

25

$100,000 to pay for this claim, nor did he have the facilities
7

He didn't have

5
2

to obtain a bank loan for thi3.
So after discussing this, at some length, with his

3

than attorney, Mr. Banner, they came to a conclusion that

4

maybe we can have some sort of a deferred type of consideration,

5

let's call it a bonus, let's call it anything else, to be

6

payable out of whatever you may be able to get from a lawsuit

7

recovered as a result of an assignment of the claim to

8

Kramer, and that is exactly what happened.

9

Mr.

If was then arranged to have

10

Q

Was it a lawyer's fee?

11

A

Well, that was part of it but that was not ——

12

Q

He got five percent of the recovery.

13

A

That was not — Mr. Kramer was not receiving

14

that as a lawyer.

15

acting as a lawyer in this case.

16

He, in fact, is a lawyer but he was not

i
Mr. Banner was the lawyer at all times.

But they

17

did arrange this through, first of all, an assignment, a

18

piece of paper, which, in unequivocal terms, stated:

|

Panama

'

19

Finance Company hereby assigns, conveys, transfers all of its

20

'
interest, including causes of actions and claims, under this

21

1959 contract to Mr. Clayton S. Kramer for $1.00 and other

22

adequate or valuable consideration, receipt, whereof,

23

hereby acknowledged.

24
25

i

is

Now, that, by concession and by all applicable law,
universally recognized,

was a complete, bona fide, and

8

1

unexceptional transfer of all of Panama's interest in this

2

contract.

3

Standing by itself it was adequate under State law

4

to permit the cause of action to be brought by Mr. Kramer, as

5

the complete and full assignee of this contract and of this

6

cause of action.

7

It was unnecessary to have anything else proved

0

or shown or executed in order to create a complete and lawful

9

assignment.

10

But to arrange for,what he considered to be, this

11

deferred consideration, if you will, that entered

12

taneously, without any secret, without any collusion or devious

13

motivations or actions, into this so-called collateral agreement,

14

wasn't pleaded in the case.

15

It didn't have to be.

into simul­

All he had to plead in the

16

complaint was that he was an assignee under this first and

17

original document of assignment.

18

collateral agreement completely reaffirmed the assignment and

19

made plain what was already implicit, that Panama had given

20

up complete control over the lawsuit or any lawsuit that

21

Kramer might bring.

The assignment — the

i

22

Kramer had complete control and management of that

23

suit, and it also provided for this provision for the so-

24

called bonus or the consideration of 95 percent of the net

25

recovery which would then go back out of any recovery Mr.

Kramer might receive ——

No, Your Honor.

No.

I thought you. said there was one lawyer who

No, only as represented Mr. Kramer.

How can you say that Kramer had full control

He did

He had his own lawyer.

18

Q

I misunderstood you.

19

A

Yes, the suggestion has been made by the

20

respondent, but is completely aside from the facts and not

21

accurate to say that Mr. Banner, who is Mr. Kramer's attorney

22

was, somehow, acting on behalf of Panama and all this.
That is not true,

course.

Panama had a firm in New York

They never got into this litigation, of

But they had their separate lawyers and Mr. Banner
10

1

dealt at arm's length with that law firm in the execution

2

of these documents.
Now, it seems to me that if becomes crystal clear

3
4

that the critical factor in this case is that the assignment,

5

itself, was absolute, complete and bona fide, and, indeed,

6

there is no dispute about that, as I see it, that all

7

Panama's interests were, thereby, transfered,

8

of the assignment instrument Panama had no claim, no right

of

and as a result

under that contract, no cause of action, no control over the
10

lawsuit that ensued.
Concededly, this was proper under the applicable

11
12

13
14

law of Texas and under the law of any other

tate in the United

tates, to effectuate a complete transfer of all of Panama’s
interests.
Now, the Court of

15

Appeals read, however, the

16

collateral agreement provision of the 95 percent bonus as

17

indicating that, somehow, Panama retained some sort of a bene­

18

ficial in this cause of action or in the contract claim.
This was conceived of by the parties as a legitimate

19
20

form of deferred consideration.

21

read this as some sort of a beneficial interest of one sort

22

or another or, perhaps, an assignment

23

of Panama,

24
25

It is, I suppose, possible to

The least that can be said about this transaction
with respect to the 95 percent interest which was to be
11

j

1

returned to Panama was that this was an assignment for

2

collection, which is one of the most transactions, lawful

3

transactions that is performed almost every clay in the business

certainly does not make the transaction, itself, collusive

recognised meaning of those phrases.
It is well established in the law, that an assignment

17

for purposes of suit and obligates the assignee to account

18

for the proceeds to another person.

19

Indeed, this Court’s decision in Titus versus

20

Wallack in 306th Volume of the United States reports that 282

21

is the leading authority on the validity of this kind of an

22

arrangement, and the Court there said, that tinder the — there

23

happened to be a New York transaction there — that under

24

repeated decisions of New York, and it could be said

25

any of er State, it has long been settled that an assignment

such title and ownership as will enable

This is true, even though the assignment is for the

4
S

purposes of suit only.

The transferee is obligated to account

6

for the proceeds of the suit to his assignor.
More importantly, and this was an opinion written by

7
8

Justice Stone, it is evident that through this kind of a

9

transaction no fraud was perpetrated upon the other party or

!G

upon the New York Courts.
The assignment of the claim operated to vest in the

11
12

assignee such ownership or interest in the claim as would

13

enable him to maintain the suit upon it there.

14

Q

15

A

Was this a diversity case, Mr. Qressman?
No, that — well, not truly a diversity case

16

in that sense, but it was a full faith and credit.

17

made -— the assignee had obtained a judgment in New York, which

18

was subsequently attacked in Ohio as being fraudulently obtained.

19

This Court said, not at all, that there had been no fraud

20

perpetrated by virtue of making an assignment for collection

21

only.

22

They had

This was a perfectly legitimate and lawful transa ctior..

23

Now, we have to, therefore, apply the language of 1359 to this

24

arrangement which I have described.

25

X think it i,s ver instructive to note that 1359,
13

of

1

course, was created as a part of the 1948 revision of Judicial

2

Code.

3

our statutes, 1789, the so-called anti-assignment statute whichj

4

was very simple in its concept.

Prior to 1948 we had on the books from the beginning of i

3

That was that if the original parties to a transaction

6

did not have adequate diversity or were unable to bring suit

7

in a Federal Court, you could not, by assignment, create a

8

different result.

9
10

j

In other words, the assignee was absolutely bound
by/the jurisdictional situation created by the original
r

It

parties, and you could not change that.

12

with a lot of exceptions and legislative jargon and also

13

barred the good assignments and the bad assignments, as long

14

as the original party couldn't sue, the assignee could never

15

bring an action.

That became encrusted

V •

16

So they decided to eliminate that provision completely

n

and to adopt rather the concept developed under the 1875

18

statute abeying any

19

collusively or improperly make as a party plaintiff any

20

individual where the intent was to create or invoke Federal

21

Court jurisdiction.

22

kind of a transfer or device which would

The revisers of the Judicial Code made it very plain

23

that they were cutting down on the assignment, the scope of,

24

what you might call the anti-assignment statute, by confining

25

its application to cases wherein the assignment is improperly
14

i
j

\

1
2

or collusively made to invoke jurisdiction.
They made it clear,

there is no dispute about this,

that the revisers meant to apply the long-established principle

4

of the 1875 statute to assignments.

5

■w-

3

What are those principles?

Well, in the first
'
assignments* not all transfers

6

place it is clear,, that not all

7

design to evoke diversity jurisdiction are outlawed nor do

0

they divest the Federal Court of jurisdiction.

i

9

Only those that result from a collusive or improper

10

action in establishing the party plaintiff, many people,

11

including many commentators seem to think that 1359 bars

12

all assignments that create diversity jurisdiction.

13

simply, is not the way the statute reads.

14
15
16
17
13
19

20

Q

That,

Mr. Gressman, could I look at this as being an

assignment of five percent of this?
A

That is one way it could be, as an absolute

assignment of five percent to Mr. Kramer.
Q

Well, wouldn't that be "improper” for the purpose

of getting Federal jurisdiction, for all, for 100 percent?
A

Mo, I don't know that there is any — that you

21

define impropriety or collusiveness in terms of the percent of

22

what is absolutely conveyed or what is beneficially conveyed.

23

If it is conceded once that you can sign simply for collection

24

only, which is done all the time --

25

Q

And get Federal jurisdiction on that?
15

I

I

A

Yes, Your Honor.

2

Q

It is done for the whole 100 percent.

3

A

If it is done for collection only.

As I

4

understand it, that has consistently been held to make the

5

assignee for collection only as distinguished from an agent

6

for collection only ---

continuously,

Do you have any of those cases cited?
Well, I think the leading case that is cited
is the Titus v WalXack, v?hieh is not a 1359

case.

Q

12

AI don't think

Well, that is all I am talking about.
there is any leading authority

24

the cases, to Your Honor where that has been held by lower

courts o

16

II

{

i

Now,, the basic doctrine that was established and

1

2

created by these pre-revision cases in other types of

3

transfers than assignments was that a transfer was not improper

4

or collusive if it was real and, in fact, operated to transfer

5

all the transfer order's interest and we submit that by conces­

6

sion and that by law and by fact that requirement has hare been

7

satisfied by the absolute character of the assignment to Mr.

8

Kramer regardless of whether you conceive of that assignment

9

as one for collection of all or some or an absolute

10

period.
If the transfer was lawful and complete, as it was

51
12

assignment,

here, then we submit that the cases in this Court make it

53

absolutely clear that the fact that the transaction was motivated

14

and designed by a desire to create or to utilise Federal diversity

15

jurisdiction becomes completely irrelevant.
This Court has said time and again in these pre­

16

M

revision cases that motive per se cannot invalidate or make

18

collusive or improper a transaction that is lawful and bona

19

fide and results in a complete transfer of legal title to

20

whatever is being transferred.

21

What do you suppose collusive means in this

22

statute?

24

plaintiff and the defendant to make a ——

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

You may speak, Mr. Lyons.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS G„ LYONS, ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

10

MR. LYONS:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

I
12

13

Court:
To restate the facts at somewhat greater length,

14

in the summer of 1964 there were two lawyers in Wichita Falls,

15

Texas, one was Mr. Jack Banner, one was Mr. Clayton Kramer.

16

Mr. Banner, according to the record, was briefing

17

a legal point in connection with a contract.

That contract

18

was the contract between Panama and Venezuela Finance Company
and Caribbean Mills, Inc. Both of those are alien corporations!

19
20
21

Neither of them could have sued the other in Federal Court.
The contract,under Panama's view of it,was already

22

two years in default.

23

and under Panama^ view three annual installment payments had

24

already gone by without payment having been made.

25

There were annual installment payments

One day Mr. Kramer and Mr. Banner met as they had
20

1

many times in the past and Mr. Banner said to Mr. Kramer

2

that there was a claim which might be acquired.

3

Mr. Banner must have gotten the claim from somewhere.

Obviously,

4

That conversation, which is in the record, evidently

5

indicates an authority on Mr. Banner’s part to offer the claim

6

to Mr. Kramer.

7

the way, knew nothing about the claim.

8

stranger to the transaction, didn't know any of the parties

3

involved.

same thing.
In that agreement, which, unlike the first agreement,

23

referred to the other document.

In that agreement there was

24

a covenant on the part of Mr. Kramer to prosecute the claim to

25

final judgment and there was a promise on Mr. Kramer's part to
21

i

pay 95 percent of the net recovery on the claim back to the

2

assignor, Panama»
Mow, even though Mr. Kramer, in his

3

somewhat

4

difficult testimony, in the transcript never admitted that

5

the motive for this transaction was to create Federal jurisdic­

0

tion.

7

Counsel has admitted at various times that the

3

motive and other times a motive was to create Federal jurisdic­

9

tion and the record suggests no other motive but that.

10

The parties, then, Mr. Kramer and Mr. Banner, entered !

11

into a contingent fee agreement, the side agreement that Mr.

12

Kramer and Panama had entered into, permitted Mr. Kramer to
i

13

enter into contingency fee agreements up to 33-1/3 percent,

14

and that sort of arrangement was, in fact, entered into with

15
16
17
18

19
20
31

22
23
24
25

Mr. Banner's firm and six weeks later there was a suit filed
in Mr. Kramer's name in the Federal Court.
Q

Is that 33-1/3 percent of the total recovery?

A

Yes, that comes off top and then the five

percent slice comes out for Mr. Kramer and then the other 95
goes back to Panama.
Q

Is the five percent of 100 percent or is it

of the 66-2/3?
A

It is of the 66-2/3.

Q

After that time was there any impropriety in

this arrangement?
22

A

1

2

I would think no impropriety had occurred

at this time up to the time

that the complaint was filed.

Now, when you take a single unitary transaction,

3
4

and put it in two pieces of paper, rather than one, that, in

S

and of itself, fraudulent

6

or improper, but it certainly gives

you the means to commit an impropriety or to commit a fraud.

7

Q

Gives what?

Q

A

Gives you th© means to commit an impropriety

9
10
11

or to commit a fraud, because it creates a situation in which
you can refer to one document and keep the other document in
your desk drawer.

12

13

State?

Q

Is that impropriety under Federal law or under

A

I would say that was.

.

14

It is our position that

15

it is. Your Honor.

Indeed, it is our position that if this

16

was openly done and,of course, once the discovery procedures

17

started working the facts came out in the open.
Even if this was openly done that this amounts to,

18

19

under the teachings of the cases in this Court, to an improper

20

and collusive assignment.
''

The complaint was then filed in the Federal Court.

21

22
23
24
25

The complaint alleged that

Panama had assigned, sold and

delivered its interest and rights in the agreement to Clayton
S. Kramer.

It didn't say a word about the fact th&fc Panama

had beneficial interest in 95 percent of the net recovery.
23

Not unexpectedly/the defense of the lawsuit wondered

or manufacture diversity jurisdiction and the fourth factor is

10

that the assignor retains a beneficial ownership in the claim.
low, in 1875 when the diversity of citizenship

11

12

jurisdiction of the Federal Courts was enlarged, there was

13

enacted by Congress a protective statute which provided in

14

substantially the substantially the same language as present

15

Section 1359 that the Federal Courts would not have jurisdictior

16

where a party was made or added,through assignment or other­

17

wise, improperly or collusively in order to create Federal

18

jurisdiction.

19

In the 35 years after that statute was passed, there

20

was a whole string of cases which came before this Court which

21

involved these four elements.

22

the assignment made after the dispute arose, the motive to

23

create

24

interests in the claim by the assignor.

They involved the assignment,

Federal jurisdiction, and the retention of the benefici, .1

25
25

That,, last, is, of course, is an important factor.

1
2

There are another line of cases that hold that where the

3

assignment is, in fact, absolute, where a party buys a claim,

4

pays money for it and the assignor has no further interest

5

in the outcome of the litigation, that you may then look to

6

the assignee's citizenship,

7

diversity jurisdiction.

8
9

A

for the purpose of determining

This case is not on that side of the line.

Mr. Kramer

here had been willing to make an evaluation of the claim, pay

10

money for it and, in effect, be quits with Panama, leave

11

Panama with no interest, whatsoever, in this claim.

12

The cases seem to teach that that sort of assignment

13

is not improper or collusive.

But this line of cases which

14

we review at Pages 14 to 18 of our brief which were decided

15

in the years immediately after the passage of this statute
>

i

16

hold that where the assignor has retained the beneficial

17

interest in the claim and the beneficial interest in these

18

cases vary? some cases it is 100 percent? other cases, it was

19

less than 100 percent, and the assignee, like Mr. Kramer here,

20

was given a percentage for the use of his name.

21

But these cases hold that that constitutes an

22

improper or collusive assignment and they use the words

23

improper or collusive and

24

to this arrangement between these two parties, even though

25

apply this concept of collusion

these are not tx«.?o parties on different sides of the lawsuit.
26

\

2

Q

In other words, Mr. Kramer did undertake some

obligations in connection with the assignment.

3

A

He undertook to prosecute the claim.

4

0

He promised?

5

A

Yes.

6

Q

He just didn’t say, "If I do it” ~—

7

A

No, he didn't.

8

Q

i-o he promised, and if he had paid some money

9

for the claim, you suggested it might not have been collusive?
A

10
11

Q

Well, he did acquire full title except if he

was successful.
A

14
15

Well, if he had acquired full title to the claim,

there would be no reason for him to -—

12
13

He couldn't walk away from this,

Well, that is true.

Well, full title to a sero

claim is not a —
Q

16

But, nevertheless, the question is jurisdiction,

17

not how much the claim was worth, and he did acquire full title

18

to the claim based on a promise to do something and if his

19

efforts were unsuccessful he would go on owning the whole claim

20

worth nothing.

21

A

That is right.

22

Q

But if he was successful, he would still own

23

five percent.

form of a judgment that there would be any reason to cut it up*
Q

2

3

In any event, no matter what happened, he would

have five percent?

4

A

He would have five percent of the net recovery.

5

0

So at least he should have been able to sue for
!

6

five percent in a Federal Court.

A

7

If he and the assignor had joined together and

8

sued, there wouldn't have been diversity because the statute

9

does not cover that sort sf a suit.
The petitioner seeks to distinguish this line of

10
11

cases in this Court which construe the statute on the three

12

bases:
First, they point to the

13
14

cation.

-

effect of the 1948 codifi­

They suggest, as I believe Mr. Gressman might have
,

15

this morning, that the assignee clause from the 1789 statute

16

had something to do with this.
Actually, it did not.

17

18
19

The statute that is presently

on the books is, according to the revisers notes, and according :
to its

language, a codification of bringing forward of the !87Sj

20

statute which is the statute under which this line of cases was

21

decided.

22
23
24
25

The revisers notes, even though they drop certain
of the language, the language that was dropped was not the
language relied upon by the Court in this old line of cases
and the revisers notes indicate that the desire was to carry

28

1

forward the 1875 act.
Under those circumstances,, we submit that the

2
3

revision does not change the value of the prior cases.

4

statute has always

5

been construed to cover cases where the only collusion is this

6

relationship between the assignor and the assignee in which

the assignor still has the interest in the claim.

The

11

question here is not whether Mr. Kramer could have brought

14

this

suit in a State court.

I assume he couldn't.

I some-

times wonder why he didn't.
The question here is whether the Pederal standards

15

of improper or collusive, if the gloss that has been put on

16

them by the earlier cases, what that standard means.

17

In fact, in a number of those cases, the Court seems

18

to have commented or to have assumed that the assignment was

19

good under State law.

Finally, there.is a lengthy suggestion in the brief

21

that, somehow, even though this might not be good in the

22

case of an assignment where the real parties in

I must confess that I am somewhat unable to follow

Q

Mr, Lyons, may I just get back for a moment

to the colloquy with Justice White.
Did I understand you correctly to say that the

6

test here of collusion should be the retention of an economic

7

interest, in this instance 95 percent of the 66-2/3?

8

A

That certainly is one of the tests. Your Honor.

9

Q

Well, I thought you also suggested to Justice

10
11
12

18
14

White that if he lost and he had nothing to return, then what?
A

Well, if he lost, there was nothing to return.

He owned the whole claim if he lost but ——
Q

Well, would you concede in those circumstances

that there would be jurisdiction?

he might lose.

19

Q

The reason he is bringing the suit is with the

But the point is, do I understand you correctly,

20

that, because under this arrangement, the assignor on paper

21

had a 95 percent interest in 66-2/3 percent of any recovery

22

there was a recovery?

23

A

That is correct.

24

Q

That that factor, in and of itself, establishes

25

collusion?

That is what X wanted to get.

4

A

— which, taken with other factors, this Court

5

has held to involve impropriety and collusion.
None of these factors standing alone might give us

6
7

a case of impropriety and collusion, but I think from the

8

analysis of the other cases, the other cases all have these

9

four factors»
Xhey have the motive, they have the assignment,

10
11

they have the fact that the assignment is made after the

12

partiess have fallen into dispute and it appears that there will

13

be litigation, and they have the retention of the interest

14

by the assignor.
Q

15

Now, what did you say would be the answer if this

16

suit had only been for five percent of the 66-2/3 percent,

17

if that is all that Mr. Kramer --

of the cause of action or that a necessary party has not been

22

the case is no longer within the diversity statute.

there was a sum of 45 percent of legal title, you would have

to join them both.

Now, in some ways this case is unique.

There were

2

a lot of cases in the first 35 years after the passage of the

statute in this Court.

4

there was a development of the law that discouraged this sort

of thing.

There was a whole line of cases and

This is a relatively unique case.

holding that an assignee for collection may sue only in his

This is the first case to reach this Court after the

1948 revision, but the pre-revision cases teach that this is

and it is improper in the sense that it is not a proper way to

Have there been any to the contrary in this

Court or in the Federal system?

There was

no collusion between the two sides of the lawsuit, but the

assignee got into was collusive.

Q

May I ask you if your argument doesn’t leave

11

the result, which may be right, that it is just improper —-

12

collusive, violation of the act for any person to transfer

13

a claim in order to give Federal Court jurisdiction?

14

A

I don’t believe it does, Yoxir Honor.

15

Q

Why not?

16

A

I think the cases hold,the prior cases of this

17

Court, that if the parties are willing to actually deal in thesx

10

claims, to sell them from one party to the other, so that the

19

party who acquires it is the master and the owner of the claim

20

and the party who transfers no longer has an interest in that

21

claim, that that is not collusive, that that is an ordinary,

22

economic transaction and the cases draw the line at that point.

23
24
25

The motive,itself, to create Federal jurisdiction
isn't conclusive and we admit that.
Q

You would say then that
35

a transfer for the

purpose of letting somebody else file an assignment, the

purpose of letting somebody else file a claim in Federal

Court under diversity is bad.

No, it is not, Your Honor, if the assignor

That is correct.

By that is meant that he has

to remit the proceedings back to the assignor.
If the assignment here created Federal jurisdiction,

All you have to

do is to find an out-of-State assignee, assign the claim and

take his covenant back to prosecute the lawsuit —-

Q

Indeed, are you with need that there be some

clerk in the law office that lived in Oklahoma?

I would think so, you would probably want someone

I think,if considera­

one percent.

There would be competition in this matter, I

suppose, as in all economic matters and what we would have

would be a universally available instant diversity jurisdiction.
Anyone could do it.

Every lawyer who had a claim

4

between two parties of the same State, I believe, would be

5

duty-bound to consider whether he shouldn't create Federal

jurisdiction by dredging up a clerk of out-of-State citizen­

ship and assign the claim to him with a set

Q

19
20

What concern do you think the Black and White

Taxicab case has on this case?
A

21

Well, I think that is probably is still a law

22

there.

You had a case of the assignor having been dissolved

23

and the assignor was no longer in existence and the Court

24

held that since the assignor had been dissolved, that that was

25

conclusive.
37

i

There are early cases which the Court distinguished

2

in Black and White which hold if the assignor is not dissolved,

**

where you transfer the claim to a corporation of another

4

State, where the assignor is not dissolved and remains in

existence — there the predecessor of 1359 is violated and

there is no Federal Court jurisdiction.
