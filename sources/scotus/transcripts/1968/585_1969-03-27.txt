FURTHER ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.

S

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I said yesterday that Section 8(a)Cl) of the Labor Act 9

10

when read together with Section 8(c), prohibits the employer

11

from coercively interfering, by threat or reprisal, with employe o»

12

free choice in selecting a bargaining representative.

13

Now, of course, Congress never said in the Act, or

14

in its legislative history, that the threat of reprisal need be

15

in any particular form of words, or that it need be confined

15

within the compass of a single communication in order to be an

17

unfair labor practice.

18
13
20

2!
22
23
24
25

Congress was concerned with substantial rights, and
did not create any such loopholes in this Act.
Now, in this case, we are not dealing with an employer
who was so ill-advised as to threaten his employees in blatent,
unequivocal terms; but the Board also has a responsibility, in
protecting the rights that Congress has guaranteed, to determine
whether an employer who has carefully avoided the utterance of
any specific, overt threat, has nevertheless intimidated his
25

1

employees by getting the message across in the totality of what

2

is said that there is a real threat of company reprisal if they

3

should select the union.

4

In assessing whether the employer's communications

5

were calculated to have that effect, and more importantly, whefch 31

6

they were likely to be understood by the employees, as such a

7

threat, the Board, of course, tries realistically to take into

0

account all the circumstances, including any factors that may

9

make the employees especially susceptible to employer intimida­

iO

tion «,

As Judge Hayes of the Second Circuit, who is a long­

n
12

time and distinguished scholar of labor law, has suggested in a

13

dissenting opinion, "It is not always easy for those of us who

14

are in a profession which shows no signs of obsolescence, and

15

which offers a wide variety of employment flexibility, to

16

appreciate that the insecurities of workers who are not so

17

fortunately situated can make them painfully vulnerable to the

18

pressures of equivocal or veiled threats by their employers.''
Now, one additional word of background may be illumi­

19

20

nating before turning to this record.
The particular kind of threat involved in this case,

21

22

the threat of plant closure, has long been recognized as one of

£3

the most flagrantly coercive and destructive of employee free

£4

choice.

25

In one of the leading opinions in this entire field,

Franks Brothers against the Labor Board, in Volume 321 U.S., in

26

1

a unanimous opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Black, the Court

2

singled plant closure out for special emphasis in the following

3

language s

4

"Before the election was held* petitioner conducted

5

an aggressive campaign against the union, even to the ex­

6

tent of threatening to close its factory if the union won

7

the election."

8

Part of the record which the Board was dealing with in

9

this case is cogently summarized, 1 believe, in the petitioner's

10

brief, and I would like to read a few short sentences at the

11

bottom of page 5 and the top of page 6 s

12

'"During this same period, 1952 to 1965, changes were

13

made in weaving industry equipment.

14

were automated to the point where they could be run without

15

an operator.

16

which made it much easier to operate, and some skills for­

17

merly needed were eliminated.

18

The company*s looms

Electric clutches and fingers were added,

"Although it was not unusual to have apprentices in

19

1952, the situation changed in the industry after that time;

20

because of automation.

21

since 1952."

22

The company had had no apprentices

The question, then, was whether the employer's com­

23

munications to this group of employees whose skills had become

24

technologically outmoded to a substantial degree, were likely

25

to have had a coercive effect by conveying a threat of reprisal.
27

1

Mow , the Board relied on the purport and effect of

2

these communications as a whole , rather than on any particular

3

statements, and they are rather diffusively spread over the

4

record.

5

argument, the communications as,a whole , but I will attempt to

6

make a quick survey of them.

It is difficult to present, in the course of an oral

Relying upon the Board’s findings in its opinion, at

7
8

first, and the distillation that it made of these communications,

9

from the record, if I can begin as background with the earlier

10

communications starting on page 172 of the appendix, in the find­

11

ings, and there were findings in the Board’s opinion, in the

12

first speech made to all of the employees when the President of

13

the company first learned of the union’s organising campaign,

14

long before any demand for recognition had been made, he spoke,

15

toward the bottom o£ page 172, of the company’s financial con-

16

dition, indicating that ever since the last strike, the shop

17

had bcsen running on thin ice.

,

He emphasized that if the company could not agree to

18
'

19

the union’s demands, the union’s only weapon is a strike, and

20

pointed out that, while he did not intend to close, a strike

21

could lead to a closing of the plant.

22

He also told the group that the wireweavers’ craft

23

was a small one? that if would be difficult for them to find

24
25

other jobs, because it was not like finding a job as a machinist;
that many of them did not have the education, which would make
28

1

it difficult for them to find another job; and that many of them

2

were getting too old to go out and find new jobs»

3

Continuing on page 174 , he said that he did not think

4

the. Lindsey organizations, the new owners, were going to be con­

S

cerned if, through contract negotiations with the union, our

6

people went on strike; that a strike could close respondent's

7

plant and nothing would prevent Lindsey from having respondent’s

8

weaving work done at Lindsey's plant in Ohio and Mississippi»

9

He also stated that respondent was subject to foreign

10

competition; that it was conceivable that if the plant was

11

closed, under any circumstances, that some of the work would go

12

to foreign companies; and that respondent had handled foreign

13

wires in the past»

14

He pointed out that all they had to do was to look

15

around Holyoke if they thought a strike could not close respon­

16

dent's plant.

17

Continuing with a letter sent on November 5fch to all

18

of the employees, on page 175, in the text of this letter he sai

19

that the new ownership is interested in profits and not pressure

20
21

22
23
24
25

They have no ties with Holyoke or Massachusetts,
Skipping down, "The union promises you a lot, but i^hat
can they deliver except pressure and the threat of a strike?"
He then stated, "I do not believe the threat of a strike will
cause the new owners any loss of sleep; however, a long strike
would be bad for me because I would like to remain in Holyoke,"

29
i

a

1

Next 1 would like to turn to 178 in these findings,

2

getting into the period within 30 days before the election, upon

3

which the Board directly relied, in a letter of November 30th

4

addressed to all the wiraweavers.

5

third line:

6

Reading from page 178, the

This lettex’warns that?

"A strike can still close the Holyoke plant, but other

7

plants can pick up the work and that the new ownership is

8

interested in profits and not pressure»"

9

He then points out that "The Teamster Onion'cannot do

10

anything to improve our profit position, but can only make big

11

demands which the company cannot meet, and then call you out on

12

strike, because a strike is a union’s only weapon to enforce its

13

big demands „89

:I

14

He then asks, "Can you afford a long strike when you

15

know the Holyoke plant has been given a second chance to stay

IQ

in business and furnish jobs for all of us?"

17

I would like to turn directly to the employer’s last

18

communications during the two days before the election.

First

19

of all, a leaflet which was distributed to the wireweavers two

20

days before the election, and which appears on page 137 of the

21

appendix, in a fold-out0

22

of the appendix, with a cartoon showing a grave being prepared

23

for the Sinclair Company, surrounded by tombstones marked with

24

the names of other companies in the area that had closed down,

25

and underneath the cartoon, among the comments is the statement

It begins, you will note, on page 137

30

"The Holyoke-Springfield industrial graveyard is filled with

2

companies which died under union pressure.”

3

Then on the next page* on the reverse side* in the

4

first column* under the heading* "Many were sick when the union

5

doctor came in."

6

already sick when the unions came in with big promises to the

7

employees of what the unions could do for them.

8

needed higher production and better quality to meet the stiffer

9

competition.

testimony* however* on pages 40 and 41 of the

Perhaps you feel I am exaggerating or bluff­

I am deadly serious and I am deeply concerned.
And the final sentence:

"To you and your dependents,

7

this is one of the most important elections in which you will

Q

ever vote."

9

We believe that on this record, in the circumstances

to

of this community and this audience, the Court of Appeals cor­

11

rectly held that it was permissible, perhaps not required, but

12

permissible for the Board to conclude that the atmosphere of

13

free choice which Congress has ordained for representation

14

elections had been undermined by an implied threat, a threat

15

that the employer anticipated that it would not be able to be

16

able to agree to a contract with the union, and anticipated

17

making other arrangements for its wireweaving needs; if the union

18

should win the election, that this would lead either to the

19

closure of the plant or to the transfer of the wireweaving opera

20

tions elsewhere.

21

22
23
24
25

Under the Act, this was a judgment for the Board to
make, subject, of course, to the safeguards of judicial review.
It is the sort of judgment that the Board is required to make in
a very large number of cases every year.
For example, during fiscal 1967, more than 8,000

34

1

representation elections were conducted by the Board, and during

2

the same year, objections were filed with the Board to 1369 such

3

elections.

4
S

Q

Mr. Wallace, are you going to talk about the

authorisation cards here?

S

A

X am, Your Honor, in just a moment, if X may.

7

In evaluating such objections, the Board has shown

G

appropriate solicitude for the statutory rights of employers

9

under Section 8{c| to express their views during the campaign.

to

For example, at a 1966 decision concerning Ameress Corporation 1

11

in Volume 162 of the NLRB Reports, the Board held that the fol­

12

lowing inaccurate and intemperate criticism of the union was

13

privileged under this section, a statement by a supervisor that

14

the company did not want the union in, that "all they was good

15
16

17

for was blowing up people's houses and kidnapping their kids,
and that they was run by nothing but a bunch of gangsters."
The Boards decisions also have upheld the right of an

18

employer to explain realistically to his employees that his

19

business situation is unfavorable and precludes increases in

20

their compensation or other benefits so long as this is done in

21

22

23
24
25

a non-coercive way.
The employees in such a situation might still wish to
select a bargaining representative to protect them against reauctions of benefits or loss of employment.

Of course, we do not

claim that the Board has been infallible in its judgments in
35

.

1

every one of the many cases requiring it to draw the line be-

2

tween protected expressions of views and implied threats, but

3

we do claim that in the present case, the Board3s conclusion was

4

an unremarkable one.

5

of -the Congressional mandate for protection of employee free

6

choice from the threat of economic coercion by the employer andf

1

indeed, we think the case would become remarkable only if this

Q

Court were to convert this record into a script which thereafter:

9

could be used by employers with impunity to intimidate their

20

employees.
Q

11
12

It was a clearly 'warranted implementation

What do you mean by that?

If we didn't decide

for you, this would be a bad precedent?
A

13

Well, I mean that

this record would be pub­

15

lished, and I am certain -it would be used in counseling as to
3r
representations that could be made in the course of these cam­

IQ

paigns , and as to which the Board could not make a judgment that

17

coercion had unlawfully had occurred.

Q

Well, if we decided you were right on this issue,

there would be nothing improper about that?

Of course, that is true.

It is another way of telling it.

You are cautioning us.

22

case.

23
24
25

That is quite

correct.

36
I

1

A

That is exactly the point I meant to make»

But

2

once it is decided -- it was decided in this case -- that wrong­

3

ful coercion by the employer destroyed the accuracy of the elec­

4

tive process as a measure of employee sentiment,, the Board's

3

remedy of a bargaining order, it seems to me, became plainly

S

warranted on the facts of this case»

7

The union had made a very strong showing of employee

G

support by obtaining authorisation cards from a large majority

9

of the employees, 11 of the 14 in the bargaining unit»

The

10

authenticity of these cards is no longer disputed, and the

11

employer never disputed the authenticity of eight of them»

12

claim has been made that they were obtained by misrepresents-

13

tion or coercion»

No

The cards themselves, which are in the appendix on

14
15

page 109, unequivocally designate the union, as bargaining repre­

16

sentative, and include an application for membership in the

17

union»

13

■

In these circumstances, the employer's coercive power

19

during the election campaign permitted the Board, and it does

20

not always draw this inference, but it permitted the Board to

21

infer that the employer's refusal to bargain in response to the

22

union's request, based on the cards, was motivated not by good

23

faith doubt as to the union's majority status, but motivated

24

primarily by a desire to try, by wrongful means, to dissipate

25

that majority»

37

i
2

Q

Mow here» of course» the union lost the election,

didn't they?
A

3

That is correct»

What 1 just spoke of was the

4

basis for the Board's finding of an 8(a)(5) violation, a refusal

5

to bargain for which a bargaining order is always the appropriat;

S

remedy„
The Board held, moreover, in this case, that even in

7

e

the absence of an 8(a) (5) violation, the bargaining order v/ould

9

have been an appropriate remedy for an 8(a)(1) violation, and is

10

so indicated by the Franks Brothers case, which I have referred

n

to in 321 U.S., in which this Court said that the union had lost

12

its majority because of the employer's coercive threats and none

13

theless upheld unanimously the bargaining order based on the

14

authorization cards»

15

Q

What was the date of that case?

16

A

That was in 321 U.S., and it was under the Wagner,

18

Q

Not under the Taft--Hartley Act»

19

A

Not under the Taft-Hartley Act»

20

Because the employer's 8(a)(1) violation in this case !

17

Act»

'

2!

could not readily be cured so as to restore the conditions neces­

22

sary for an election, free from the effects of his wrongful coerj

23
24
25

cion, the Board was warranted in relying on the decisive majority
indicated by the cards as a more accurate showing of employee
sentiment than an election would be in the existing circumstances
38

I

and thus to decide that the requested right of employees to

z

bargain collectively should be enforced without further delay,

3

This is not a drastic remedy because, as in the case

4

of any bargaining order, there will be opportunities for interes

S

ed persons to request another election to measure any changes in

6

employee sentiment after a reasonable period of time.
In sum, therefore, we believe the Court of Appeals was

7

S

entirely correct in treating this case as a rather routine

9

example of the Board's proper discharge of its statutory respon­

10

sibilities, which is the flavor one gets from the opinion of the

11

Court of Appeals reviewing this record.

12

Thank you.

13

Q

Could I ask you a question on these cases which

14

you sketched out as to the Board using its judgment on the total­

15

ity.

16

where it approached these unfair labor practices on a totality

17

approach?

18

Has the Board ever been reversed on one of these cases

Has it ever bean reversed?
A

Not to my knowledge, although there have been

19

relatively few cases ias which the only wrongful conduct, the only-

20

unfair labor practice, was in implied threats of coercion with­

21

out any wrongful interrogations or wrongful discharges.

22
23
24
25

There are two Seventh Circuit cases upholding the Board
in such situations that are cited in our brief, and those are the
only ones that I know of other than this decision from the
First Circuit upholding an order based exclusively on this kind
39

1

of unfair labor practice.

2

Thank you.
