ORAL ARGUMENT OF KARL P. WARDEN

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. WARDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

court, I am counsel for William Joe Johnson who is a prisoner

1*0

in the Tennessee State Penitentiary in Nashville, Tennessee.

11

As of the time of this argument today William Joe Johnson has

12

served approximately three years in solitary confinement or in

13

maximum security or in segregated environment within the

14

penitentiary.

15

finement called fox'5 by his sentence, which is a life sentence

10

for the crime of rape.

17

This confinement is over and above that con­

The reason for this extraordinary confinement is

!8

because he has violated one rule of the Tennessee state prison

19

system, and that rule is here being challenged today.

20

is that no inmate shall advise, assist or otherwise contract to

21

aid another, either with or without a fee, to prepare writs or

22

other legal matters.

23

That rule

The United States District Court which first heard

24

this case determined that his confinement was arbitrary and

25

capricious and that it was in violation of Title 28, United
3

1

States Code, annotated Section 2242, and it was in violation

2

of the United States Constitution.

3

The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court.

4

Our argument here today seeks to have the United States Court

S

of Appeals reversed, to have further enforcement of this prison

6

rule ended, and to have William Joe Johnson returned to the

7

general prison population and these unnecessary restraints on

0

his liberties ended.

9

The basis for our argument is fivefold.

The two

10

major points we wish to make are that, first off, the state of

11

Tennessee, by enforcing this prison rule, and by providing no

12

alternative assistance, has effectively blocked access to the

13

courts by those prisoners who are indigent and inarticulate or

14

illiterate, and that to so prevent these people from being heard

15

is a violation of due process, a violation of equal protection,

16

and a violation of the First Amendment freedoms of speech and

17

the right to petition for redress of grievances.

18

Our second principal point is that this prison

19

regulation is not a proper exercise of the state’s limited

20

power to regulate the practice of law for two reasons.

21

One, this is not the practice of law; and two, even

22

if it should be considered the practice of law it is beyond the

23

power of the state to restrict this particular kind of practice.

24
25

Our further points are that Title 28, section 2242
of the United States Code annotated reflects the ancient common

4

I

law right of one layman to prepare , sign and verify petitions

2

of habeas corpus for those who cannot help themselves.

3

And the final two points are that the petitioner

'4

does have standing to raise these issues , and that was the

15

holding of both the district and the court of appeals, and

(S

finally that this is a proper case and circumstance for federal

7

courts to Intervene with state prison management.

8

apparently this has been agreed to by the State of Tennessee in

9

its supplemental brief provided that the court finds that these

I

10

regulations are in violation of federal rights.

II

Now as to our first point.

And

It is clear that a
;

52

prisoner ifho can employ an attorney will be fully and well heard

53

by whatever court he wishes to pet fcion.

!4

clear that if this prisoner is indigent that he has, then, only

15

four alternatives.

56

lawyer into representing him.

■

57

But it is equally

One of these is to be able to talk some

The second is to proceed pro se.

The third is to get

53

help from someone untrained in law.

19

forget about it altogether and let his claim go by the board.

20

The fourth is just to

As to the first of these alternatives.

If he can

25

talk a lawyer into taking the case, all of us who practice law

22

know what happens to the attorney who agrees to help one in™

23

digent prisoner.

24

not only that prison but from every prison in the country

25

requesting similar aid.

He is immediately

5

inundated with letters from

i

'1

0,

Are there not some states which provide legal

services for prisoners?

3

A.

It seems to me California has that.

California has an amicus brief here, Your Honor.

4

do not believe that California provides counsel for indigent

5

prisoners.

S

Q,

But some assistance?

7

A.

They provide assistance of prison guards and

8

I

chaplains, Your Honor.

9

Q.

They have a clerical staff, too, do they not?

10

A.

Apparently, yes sir.

11

Q

And apparently the courts have cooperated by setting

12
13

up these forms with check-lists.
A.

Yes, Your Honor, although 1' expect to argue a bit

14

today that these forms were in fact not much better than the

13

no assistance at all that the State of Tennessee provides.
Your Honor, in the event that this attorney does

16

i

17

receive these letters, what happens ultimately is that the claims:

18

the just claims and the unjust claims alike, all go in the waste­

1©

basket.

20

help an occasional indigent prisoner we still cannot rely on

21

casual or ’whimsical charity to preserve the constitutional

22

guarantees of persons imprisoned in the United States.

23
24

While we ought to applaud an attorney who is willing to

It is not a sufficient ansv/er here to say that prison
authorities will help these people.

First off there Is no

25 showing that these prison authorities, the guards, chaplains,

6

r

Ii

clerical help , and so on, are any more competent to provide

2

assistance than is a fellow inmate.

3

Secondlys if is clear that the prisoner knows full

4

well that the interests of his keeper and his own interests are

5

not- absolutely identical.

6

credibility gap between the Inmate and his keeper.

There is* there always will be a real

The prisoner will want someone he can turn to, some­

7
8

one he can talk to, someone he can trust — if not his lawyer

8

then his friend.

10

And his friend is much more likely to be a

fellow inmate than it is to be his keeper.
I think the millions and millions of dollars that

11
12

the legal profession and government have spent in the past few

13

years trying to bridge the communication gap between the poor

14

and the courts, the legal profession, by moving lav; offices out

15

into neighborhoods, by allowing forms of l4y intermediary

16

assistance, all these shoxf that this credibility gap here is a

17

very real thing and ought to be recognized.
And finally on that point, as an aside, if it is the

18
19

practice of law for an inmate to help write petitions, why is

20

it not the practice of law when it is done by a prison guard or

2!

chaplain as apparently it is done in California?
The activities ~

22
23

Q,

I suppose it does not go to your rhetorical question,

24

but the practice is, is it not, that people who indulge in the

25

activities In which your client indulged charged their fellow
7

1

inmates everything that the traffic will bear, and presumably

2

prison employees do not.

3

it

There is not one shred of evidence in this case that

■A

my petitioner has charged anyone for his services.

■5

deny that prisoners could charge.

16

a proper thing to do, of course.

I do not

I would deny that it would be

The activities of the petitioner here are attacked

7
©

as being the practice of law.

It is said that the state has

9

the right to regulate the practice of law and that since

10

petitioner was practicing lav/ he can be properly stopped by

11

the state prison authorities.
We claim first that this is not the practice of law,

12
53

that there was no claim here whatsoever to represent these

54

prisoners in court, that there was no pursuit of these cases

55

beyond the minimal help of helping them articulate what their

16

claim was, that he did not sign and verify these petitions for
■

57

the inmates, that he returned these petitions to the Inmates and

18

they signed them and verified them themselves even if they had

59

to sign it with an f,X" as happened in some instances.

20
21

Q

Suppose he set up an office In Nashville and held

himself out to do precisely that?

Don’t you think the bar

22

association would be rather concerned about whether that was

23

the practice of law?

24
25

A,

Yes sir, I am absolutely certain that the Nashville

Bar Association would be concerned.

8

They are a little bit

1
2

fearful about me being up here today, as a matter of fact.
Q,

Mr. Warden, is the issue as narrow as the proper

interpretation of 2242 — is it the issue before us now?
4

A.

Your Honor, I think that is only one of the issues

S

before us today.

0

First Amendment guarantee and I think that goes beyond the

7

question raised directly by 2242.

8
9
10
11

Q,

I think there is a very real question here of

If we were to say, perhaps we can agree with this as

a matter of interpretation of 2242 -- isn't that what the
district court did?
A.

The district court did that, yes, Your Honor, but

12

they also found that this was an arbitrary and capricious act

13

on the part of the federal prison authorities which was a denial

14

of equal protection to those persons who could not articulate

15

their own claims.

16
M
18

Q

Then your answer is that we have to reach the

constitutional claim?
A.

Wo, Your Honor, I do not think you would have to

19

reach the constitutional point.

20

constitutional claim because that is one facet of our argument.

21

I don't think you have to reach that in order to decide this case.
But if I may say so,sir ~

22
23
24
25

Of course, we had to raise the

Q

We would have to reach it if we didnot agree with

you on 2242.
A,

Yes, sir you certainly would in order to adopt our

view of the case.
Oj

Incidentally 9 I gather this came up — this has been

j

treated all along as an issue for habeas?

4

A.

S

Is he a state or federal prisoner?

6

A.

He is a state prisoner., Your Honor.

Yes* sir. it has.

\
<
i

7

4

8

A.

That is how we get 2242 into it.

j

I suppose so9 Your Honor.
All William Joe Johnson has done in this case is to

9
10

help these men articulate those things that they would have

11

said for themselves if they had been able to say them for

12

themselves.

13

Q

14

You must agrees he has to have standing.

Did he

have standing?
.

15
16

A.

Sir, both the district court and the court of appeals

agreed that he had standing.

4

You are not challenging that then.

IS

A

It is raised in the California amicus brief.

19

It was

not raised by the State of Tennessee.

20

Q,

Why does he have standing?

Can you tell me that?

21

A,

Yes* your Honor* I will try to.

Over and above the

22

question of whether the two lower courts agreed that he had

23

standing* he is in solitary confinement now for violation of

24
25

this rule* and this rule is the one we are here challenging
today* and in order to challenge this rule today we have to show

indigent illiterate prisoners.

For almost three years.

He was turned loose at

the end of the time when the

1

district court decided this case, Your Honor., and I am going

3

outside the record, Your Honor — he was put in the day that

9

the Court of Appeals decision came down.

10

There were breaks in this total three year period

11

because he would promise he wouldn't do it any more and they

12

would turn him loose and he would do it again.

13

4

14

A,

15

I understood this from

the record.

Yes, sir, he wasn't very trustworthy about that sort

of thing.

16

Q

He was persistent in asserting his claimed rights.

17

A.

This man comes closer, Your Honor, to being a modern

18

day Don Quixote than anyone I ever heard of.
It seems to me that we have never doubted the common

19

20

lav? right of one layman to petition for another layman and the

21

one who is being held captive could not speak for himself and

22

when the one doing the petitioning is not an officious inter-

23

medler.

All he ever did was call the court’s attention to these men.

He did not benefit in any way except the satisfaction one human

Even if this court should find that his activity was

still the state’s power to regulate stops short of the power to

Both federal and state law provide a route by which

right to use this law, hereby making the road Impossible for

11

the indigent, inarticulate and illiterate, this post-conviction

12

remedy becomes illusory.

13

First Amendment rights, but it is also then a denial of equal

14

protection laws.

16

Q,

This is not just a deprivation of

I suppose there are, or have been or may be, in the

penitentiary of Tennessee lawyers.

17

A.

Yes, Your Honor, unfortunately that is true.

18

Q,

That is a rule which would be denied them.

13

No inmate would be allowed to use ~

23

Q,

How about the Arizona case which the court decided

24

in the last term where the layman is seeking to represent an

25

indigent?
12

1

A.

Yes, Your Honor.

1 think that the rational of that

.2

case would be entirely appropriate here although this man was

<♦3

operating outside of an environment where there was a rule which

4.

prohibited any help at all.

That is exactly what this rule does.

That is the only way

That was the situation with the defendant in the

Arizona ease.
A.

Ye;s, Your Honor, It was, except it is my understanding

12

that the man who filed the petition for him was not a fellow

13

inmate but was someone outside.

14
15

Q,

They were both on the outside but the problem, I

think, would be the same of illiteracy, indigency —

16

A,

Yes, Your Honor, I think it would be.

17

Q

You do not cite this Arizona case.

18

A,

Ho, I did not.

19

Q

I suppose there is an element of considerations here

20

A,

Your Honor, I think there is an interest of the

21

state here in the manner of preserving order in the penitentiary

22

but I would say this.

23

I think we must always distinguish between desires

24

and interests.

I am sure that the prison authorities desire

25

that they have a prison full of docile, unthinking prisoners

13

•

*il

who don’t cause any trouble.

2

4

I would like for my children and my students back
here not to cause me any trouble, and to do just exactly what
(
I tell them to do.

But in the long run that would not be in my interest

6

and it would not be in their Interest, and it would, not be in

7

the society where they live., so I think we must distinguish

these things.

i©

Q,

Is it also true that this is not a question of

regulating but it is a question of prohibiting?

ii

A,

It is a question of absolutely prohibiting;. Your

ia

Honor.

13

0,

It is not a question of regulating.

14

k

If it were, Your Honor, if the State of Tennessee

15

had provided some reasonable alternative whereby these people

m

that I think are being discriminated against, could have had

17

access to the court in a realistic fashion, then we would not

!8

have perhaps have to have this case today.

19

Q,

This is the point.

I suppose you could very well

20

make an arguable case for the prisoner to have the right to

21

have some help from some competent source, without being forced

22

or logically hold that a fellow inmate has the constitutional

23

right to furnish it.

There is certainly a legitimate

review between him and the state.

3

A.

Yes a sir.

&

Q,

But is he claiming someconstitutional right himself s

7
o
9

just to represent his fellow prisoners?
A.

He claims only this., Your Honor — that the state

has not provided an acceptable alternative to.his providing help

10

for them, and that he is being punished for doing that 'which

'»1

the state has prohibited.

12

0,

What -would you say if the evidence were that he not

14

only represented prisoners but he constantly collected money

from them for it and the rule of the prison was he may help

other prisoners but he may not collect money and If you do you

16

go to solitary confinement.

13

17
18

19
20

21

A.

Your Honor, then I think he would be in solitary

confinement for having collected the money.
4

Even though there was quite a dispute between him

and the prisoner.
A.

Sir, if I understand your question then my answer is

22

that they would have an absolute right to put him in solitary

23

confinement for taking money.

24

about that.

25

There is no question in my mind

1 may as well add this to its too.
15

Even if this

1

court should find that there is some right to counsel at this

2

critical stage of the post-conviction proceeding here, 1 think

3

there might still he a constitutional question as to whether

A

one prison inmate could turn to a fellow inmate and say,

5

"You reckon I ought to go to a lawyer?"
If that is sanctioned then I think we are strictly

6
7

on First Amendment rights at that point.
And this rule would prohibit that.

So you can say as well that is what the state is

hand,

preventing him from doing.
A

The state here has claimed a number of interests, one

in prohibiting the unauthorised practice of law; one in keeping
good order in the penitentiary.

I have spoken to that but I

would like to add this one thing — there was no showing in this
case, and there canst be any showing, that the fact that one
prisoner helps another prisoner articulate his claim to a court
necessarily is going to create great disorder in a prison system
In facts I think it could be argued that these people
who are in the penitentiary, who are inarticulate, illiterates
indigent, who have no way to express these claims might very
well be a greater source of disruptions to prison discipline

Q,

Do you happen to know whether this is peculiar,

this regulation to Tennessee or is it typical of other prison

4

regulations?

5

A.

Your Honor, I am of the opinion and impression, I

I

6

should say that it is a fairly common prison regulation.

7

think California has it with a little variance in the form.

When I was in Utah recently I saw something in the
paper out there that said they had it.

I think New York has it.

There are a number of jurisdictions x^hieh have it.

I can't

The state has also claimed an interest here which

the prison authorities say falls on their side of the scale of

balancing the interest, and that is In keeping the court dockets

from being clogged.

equal impartiality, the legitimate claim along with the

17

illegitimate claim, and there certainly cannot be any kind of

18

a showing that a legitimate claim filed by an inmate who had

inmate assistance clogs the court any more than a legitimate

claim filed by an inmate who has a lawyer to help or by an

21

inmate acting pro se.

22

25

But this rule prohibits with fine and

In this rule it prohibits all of themsfche legitimate
claims and the illegitimate claims.
Under the very narrow view of the state of Tennessee
and the State of California that presumed state interest here in

But it just does not seem realistic to me to say that

13

14

to the attention of a court or lawyer in such a fashion that

15

that claim will be understood.
These people are the ones who are being discriminated

17
18

against.
The State of Tennessee has provided no alternative

means for these people.

20

a series of forms which these people might use and fill out

to fill out for themselves i3 really the central question that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. THOMAS E. FOX
FOR RESPONDENTS

11
12

I don’t

MR. FOX:

Mr. Chief Justices may it please the court,

13

on the question of federal statute, I have said in ray supple­

14

mental brief that I really do not think that is a serious

13

question because there the statute says that application for

18

writ of habeas corpus shall be in writing, signed and verified

17

by the person for whose relief it is intended, or by someone

'18

19

acting In his behalf.
I do not think that goes any further than the minis­

20

terial act of signing or verifying a petition to be filed.

21

don’t think that contemplated preparation of petition, so I do

22

not believe that statute can be relied upon as was done by the

23

trial judge, the district judge.

24

to the contrary and I think certainly that that is too involved

an interpretation of that statute.

The Court of Appeals thought

On the Question of whether or not this is the

practice of lax*, that does not answer the question.

3

the state of Tennessee cannot regulate the practice of law in

4

such a way as to deny prison inmates access to the courts, so

I think this is a different situation really from what it is on

the outside.

Why wouldn't the same

rule apply?

11

The only difference that I can see is that this is

12

favorable to people inside the penitentiary.

13

more cause to petition the courts than the people on the outside:

14

I think that might be justification for it.

They really have

I think certainly that any rule that the State of

What do you do if a prisoner asks for a laxfyer?

If the court please, under present procedure since

the adoption of our post-conviction procedure act, which was

22

adopted after this case x$as started but before it was decided

23

by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati,

x^e provide a form in the statute for making a petition.

25

Then in one of these sections we provide that no

petition will be dismissed until full opportunity has been

given to freely amend it with the assistance of counsel.
So 1 say that any man who can say "My rights are

being denied me" and signs his name to it and gets into

federal court or in our state courts, it is that broad.

Counsel will be appointed for him under the statute and the

counsel will be given an opportunity to amend it freely.

1

think from the cases 1 have read* there is not

much evidence in the record on it, but the director of the

12

federal bureau of prisons instructed the wardens at the

federal prisons to provide a writ writers room and the purpose

14

of it was to prevent the writ writers from helping prisoners

write petitions.

’’Most laymen lack the ability and it would hardly

I don’t

I think that

ould not ask somebody to write it for me and they would perform

23

1

nothing more than a ministerial act of writing what I say.

2

Then they could allow me to make my mark.

o

our regulation ought to be construed broadly enough or

4

inclusive enough to eliminate that type of situation.

5

Q,

It has been has it not?

3

A.

I don't believe it has.

I don’t believe that

If so I don’t know it*

7

unless Judge Miller, the District Judge, put that kind of

construction on it, and I think if he did that it really was

9

not necessary because, as I said before, I think we have to

10

construe our regulations and statutes in accordance with

11

their context or environment and keep in mind the thing that

12

was attempted to be permitted.

Tell me how far you think a man such as I suggested

20

federal statute gives him that right.

21

22

would intend to contradict or ignore or be in conflict with

23

federal law because we understand that.

We do not deny that he has that right and the

Q,

What —

If the prisoner told the other prisoner what he

4

wanted written I think he could do that.

is subject to that type of construction.

I think the regulation

But here is the problems and I am not sure there

6
7

is enough evidence in this record to show what takes place —

S

but it was observed in Hatfield versus Bailleaux, the court said

9

"We observe from the 2255 cases which have come before this court

10

that the penalties of perjury do not deter the writ writer from

31

writing whatever they want to."
That is the kind of thing our regulation was

12
13

designed to get rid of.
This is outside the record but the court might know

14

IS

that usually those petitions are about that thick; they are not

16

limited to what —-

17

Q

You don't think we are familiar with them?

18

A,

I don’t know whether they have been here or not.

19

You have no reported opinions on it.

20

Maybe the petitions haven’t gotten up here.

21
22

23
24
25

0,

At least I found none.

If you think that is a novel experience in this

court —
A,

If the court knows about those things that is what

we are trying to eliminate.
Q

Wouldn’t I assume that Judge Miller in Nashville gets
25

1fi

quite a few of them.

2

A.

Yes sir, he does.

3

Q,

Yet he says the regulation is bad.

4

A.

Yes sir3 he did that.

5

Q.

He is the one suffering the most, is he not?

6

A.

Fie suffers a lot.

7
8

9

I think other judges suffer just

as much.
Q

Didn’t his ruling say in so many words that he

didn’t need your help?

10

A,

Judge Miller?

II

Q,

Yes.

12

A

If the court please I don’t remember that in his

13

petition —

14

Q

He said he didn’t need that regulation.

A

Yes sir, but we are here because we say Judge Miller

15
16

17
18
19

was wrong and because the Court of Appeals in Cincinnati said
that he was wrong.

because we Insist he was wrong and the Court of Appeals of
Cincinnati put it on the basis more so on the practice of law.
I accept that theory because the court said it but

20
21
22
23

24
25

Judge Miller might be right but we are here

I do not think that quite gets to it because, as I said earlier,
it seems to me there is no question but what it is the practice
of lav;.

A state cannot regulate the practice of law in such a

way as to prevent people from coming to court.
Q>

Are we entitled to assume' that in these 2200 cases
26

which you get in your courts that the main purpose of this
regulation is to relieve the court of a difficult burden?

•a

L

That is one reason.

The other is that all the

prison officials3 state and federal that I have read about,
and 1 think the cases I have read are nearly enough to include
6

all of them, they say it undermines prisons on discipline and

/

morale and it is impossible to repatriate and rehabilitate

prisoners after they come under the influence of a writ writer

This is

what one of the courts said in Hatfield versus Ballleaux;
"Prison officials testified that if permitted to engage in such
practices, aggressive inmates of superior intelligence exploit
and dominate weaker prisoners of inferior intelligence. The
practice also tends to develop a group of inmate leaders which
is discouraged in all institutions."
Q.

What are you readin g from?

A,

I am reading from Hatfield versus Bailleaux. That

is the Ninth Circuit ease, if the court please.
I also got that 2255 eases from that same ease, the
Ninth Circuit case.

I was wondering

I have forgotten the

Petitioner here, if 1 correctly understand this, is
asking us not only to release him from what offhand seems to be
a very onerous treatment by the Tennessee prison authorities ™
he also asks us to establish his right to engage in the
practice of furnishing this kind of advice and assistance to
28

1

other inmates.

2
3

Do I correctly analyse this?
A.

Yes sir.

It is insisted upon by counsel that the

4

writ writer has that right because the inmate who has the cause

S

has that right.

6

that sounded too unreasonable so I didn’t question that-

7

provided it is found that this kind of help is necessary for

8

prisoners.

9

Q,

10

A,

He cited authority from it.

I didn’t think

You do not think that what is too unreasonable?
To say that one inmate had a right to assist another

11

inmate who was in need of his help.

There is no question about

12

his need.

13

did know how to assert his right, that he could go to another

14

person and have that person assert it.

It is reasonable to find that the other inmate

who

I think, if I understand the question properly,

15
16

because of free speech they have a right to hear the news and

17

disseminate it.

18

I hear that argument about the right of the

press in the court, to take pictures, and so on.

They say the

IS

public has a right to know and because of that we have a right

20

to gather that information and give it to the public.
I thought that was a similar sort of analagous thing.

21

22
23

24
25

I didn’t contest it.

Q,

Perhaps I should have.

That is the standing point you are addressing your-

self to?
A

Yes.
29

1

The standing of him — this petitioner to assert

&*"»

somebody else5s rights, that is what you are really talking

3

tb out?

4

A,

I did not contest that.

ierhaps almost entirely, this petitioner’s rights are derivative ;

A.

Of course we didn’t say

But that sort of bears on this, doesn’t it?

Yes, I think that is the case that was cited in

>pposing counsel’s brief.
Q.

But part of the rational of that case was great un~

.ikelihood that the rights would aver be asserted otherwise.

A,

That is right.
I noted that I have stated this a little bit

30

differently from Mr. Warden's question.

1

He is talking about

' *

2

the right of inmates tc help others when there is no other aid

3

available.

4

inmate having the right to aid another.

I

I just state it broadly on the question of one

'

If he insists now that it is not necessary and he

5
6

does not have that right when there is other aid available9our

7

position is that our post-conviction statute now makes it

8

awfully easy for any person to get into courts either federal

9

or state courts with his petition because he gets his petition

10

up there and it is not to be dismissed until an opportunity is

1!

given to freely amend it with the aid of counsel.

12

legal help.

Then he gets

One other question now about the type of punishment

13

14

that uras imposed upon the writ writer.

I think it ceased to be

IS

punishment and it became a necessary measure for prison

16

discipline and the security of the prison.
This man said and his counsel said in the hearing

17

in the federal district court that he expected to continue to

18

19

write writs without regard to what the regulations were and

20

without regard to anything else except when another means was

21

provided.
So in order to stop hims not as a matter of punish­

22

ments he has to be segregated or the prison officials have to

23

spend their time surveilling the other prisoners to see that

24

they do not get his help.

25

31
i

j

So it seems to me it is a lot easier and more

1
2

justifiable to put this man in prison and then the officials

3

have more time to spend with the other prisoners and give them

4

the help they need.

3

Q

Putting him in solitary confinement?

6

k

Segregate him from other prisoners.

7

Q,

That means solitary confinement9 does it not?

3

L

Yes sir.

9

Any time he decided that he would not

write any more he would be released.
Q.

10

There are lots of penalties involved, in the un­

II

authorised practice of law but that is kind of a new one, is it

12

not?

13

k

Yes sir, but this is a new situation in the prison.

I think you have to consider the practice of law in this

situation is different from any other situation.
