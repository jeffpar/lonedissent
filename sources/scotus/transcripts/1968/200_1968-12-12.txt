ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. OGDEN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3
4

MR. OGDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court,

5

I think this case will take a very brief time because of the

6

fact that the Petitioner was charged with contempt of court,

7

convicted without a jury after written demand and oral demand,

3

and that really is about all there is to this case.

9

He likewise is unable financially to petition this

10

Court for certiorari and asked leave of the Court to permit

11

his petition to be filed and the cause presented at the expense

12

of the Government.

13

If it is not improper, I want to just thank the

14

Court for being so generous.

15

to see a man without a dime in the world to be able to appear

16

before the highest court in the country and have his rights

17
18
19
20
21

determined.

It makes you feel awful good

I am saying this very sincerely.

I don’t have anything financially to gain or lose if
I win or lose the case,
If the Court please, in this case in 1952 in Oklahoma
City there was a default judgment rendered against Mr. Frank
'

22
23
24
25

enjoining him from in effect violating the Securities and
Exchange Act.
He is a man who gets out and tries to drill oil wells
all around.

He never Made anything at it.
2

In other words, it

i

wasn't one of these cases where somebody would go out and make

2

a lot of money and leave everybody sitting there.

3

think he ever owned a car that was paid for.

4

own a home.

S

I don't

I know he didn81

He was one of those kinds of people.

They couldn't

6

do anything against him, so they filed a suit against him,

7

He didn't appear, so they issued a judgment against him.

B

After that he just kept on, he didn't pay much

9

attention to it.

So they ,got an indictment against him.

I

10

went up there and defended him in the Federal Court for two

11

or three days.

12

He appealed to the Court of Appeals in Denver in the Tenth

13

Circuit and it xvas reversed.

The jury convicted him and he got 18 months.

After it was reversed and came back, Judge Volt, whose

14
15

son at that time was my law partner — Judge Volt was an

18

awful nice person -- suggested this case took so long to try,

17

just to let him ente.r a plea of no contention and get some kind

18

of little sentence and that would save the Government and

19

everybody else a lot of time.

He finally did.

20

That case was disposed of in that manner.

21

Then this case came along.

22

it.

23

actually occurred.

24

an excellent job.

25

Mr. Frank had moved to Tulsa.

I wasn’t employed in
That is where the act

So he had another law firm.

They did

When they presented it, the district attorney said
3

?

he was relying on a section of the statute which he read to

2

the court and convinced Judge Bohannon of the fact that he

3

wasn't entitled to a jury.

4

The Judge, however, was not too much satisfied on

5

that because he made a remark and I might read it.

6

know that it will make any difference, however, what remark

7

he made but he did make a remark that he wasn’t too satisfied

3

about the question of whether he was entitled to a jury

9

trial.

I don't

.

10

So, the Judge said, "Well, I am quite concerned

'31

about the defendant's right, for a jury trial."

12

district attorney read Title 18,

13

from that the first part of: it, that section, there couldn't

14

be any question about it but the last part confused the Judge,

15

apparently, because the first part of that section of the Code

16

says, "Whenever a contempt charge shall consist of willful

17

disobedience of any law, writ, process, order, rule or

18

decree, or command of any District Court of the U.S. by

19

doing or committing any act or thing in violation thereof, and

20

the act done or committed also constitutes a. crimincal offense

21

under any act of Congress or under the laws of any State in

22

which the act was done or committed, the accused upon demand

23

therefore shall be entitled to a trial by jury."

24
25

Now that is the Code.

Then the

Section 3691, USCA, and

Now if we had stopped there,

nobody would have been confused and the case would not have
4

A

been here.

2

by virtue of the last part, of that same section he wasnnot

3

entitled to a jury.

4

But the district attorney argued and he claimed

I would like to read the last part for the reason

5

that that is the reason that the trial judge I think denied him

8

a jury trial.

7

"This section shall not apply to contempt committed

8

in the presence of the court."

9

that.

10

Of course everybody knows

Here is the part- "nor contempt committed in dis­

11

obedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree

12

or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted

13

in the name of or on behalf of the United States."

14

Nov; that last part there is what caused this man to

15

be denied trial by jury.

16

was an act originally where the Securities and Exchange

17

Commission sued Mr. Frank and got that judgment.

18

what he is charged with violating."

19

The trial judge said, "Well, this

That is

Since he was charged with violating that act the

20

trial judge thought that was the order of the Government,

21

which I guess it is because that is, of course, a part of the

22

U. S. Government, the Securities and Exchange Commission, but

23

regardless of that it is my contention and thought — I don't

24

think that had any application v;hatever to that but it is my

25

contention and thought that this wouldn’t be any way to start
5

2

out.

2

If Congress would pass a law today and say, "Well,

3

you can try this man, give him as much as five years but he

4

is not entitled to jury trial," in other words, Congress

5

wouldn't take away a man’s constitutional right to a jury

6

trial.

7

I don't think that act does but I can’t find any

8

construction of it and I can’t tell you what it has been

9

construed to mean.

But, at any rate, and regardless of all

10

that we all know, at least I think I do, that the Congress

11

couldn’t pass a law and say, "Well, under the Sixth Amendment

12

it says in all criminal offenses.

13

14

I used to be State District. Judge for 12 years in Ardmore.

Well, this is a criminal

of court was cited in that case the court

Then our court, the Court of Criminal Appeals,

18

Oklahoma City •— we don’t appeal directly to the Supreme Court,

19

we just have one court for criminal appeals, one for civil —-

20

well, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ever since State­

21

hood has held consistently and every time that a man is entitled

22

to a jury in any casevhere he is charged with violating any

23

order of any court.

24
25

Then the Constitution of Oklahoma so provides.

The

Constitution of the U.S., it would seem to me, is just as clear,
6

1

the Sixth Amendment, that means all, it doesn't say part of

2

it»

3

How do you classify this?

They want to classify it

4

apparently — I say they, I mean the Solicitor General wants

5

to classify it as a petty offense.

6

He got three years.

Well, a petty offense is defined by the statute.

7

It is Title

3

a petty offense cannot be more than $500 ox: six months in

3

jail.

10

-

18,

Article I, and it is defined and it says

How that is set out in my brief.

by the statute itself.

11

Yet that is defined

This can’t be a petty offense.

Then that same section also defines a felony.

It

12

says any offense, now this is that same section I referred

13

to, defining a petty offense.

14

It eilso says that now we will see what a felony is.

15

If a man can get death or if he gets more than one year it is

16

a felony under the act of Congress.
Q

17

Do you think that that is an act of Congress

18

that the judge is permitted to put on probation, may defer

19

sentencing and just put him on probation?

20

A

I can’t see anv difference and I will show you
!

why.

21

Q

22

The act says there is a difference between

23

sentencing and imposition of the sentence.

24

difference.

25

A

None whatever.

7
J

There is no

This man is a good example.

He

1

2

is over at Tulsa now.

Every Monday morning he has to go up

there and report to the probation, officer.

3

he has to report to him.

4

has to report to him.

S
6
7

If he changes jobs

If he is stopped by an officer, he

He can’t leave the district without getting permissior
from the judge.

In other words, he is in prison but outside.

When you read the restrictions that the judge put

8

on there you would see that this man could go right ahead

9

here until the last day, he could go two years and 11 months

10

and 29 days and still the three years had not run out and on

11

the last day he could go out here and violate every one of

12

those and they could make him serve the entire three years.

13

He would say, "I didn’t have a jury trial."

14

"It makes no difference.

15

If Your Honor please, may I just say this the way

16
17

I put you on probation."

I look at it.
I think just logically now you could say because

18

you put him on probation ha wasn’t entitled to jury trial, but

19

he got three years on probation.

20
21

Q

You did not know how long the prison term would

be if the gentleman violated his probation and then had corae
before the judge, do you?
A

I don't have anyvay of knowing.

There is bound

to be some reason to put the three years.
Q

As a prior judge, if you never said what the
8

I

jail term was going to be, the man is on probation and he

z

cornes back before you for a probation violation, you would

3

then have to make up your mind how much of a jail term you

4

are going to impose?

5

A

If Your Honor please, I have always considered

0

that you put somebody on probation for three years or five

7

years and any time during that period, of time if they

8

violate the probation they just had to go serve the three

9

years.

That is my conception of it.

10

I might be wrong.

Eut I want to call this to your attention.

In this

tl

case just look how foolish it would be if you put a con­

12

stitutional provision in here that a man is entitled to a jury

i
;

13

trial in a criminal case.

;

Is this a criminal case?

14

IS

to me.

16

it.

That is the way it looks

Nov/ say put on probation; you can’t complain about

You say wait just a minute.
Under the Solicitor General’s opinion, say you are

17
18

a Federal District Judge, you come up here and the man is

19

going to be tried.

20

trial but I can’t tell whether I can give you a jury trial

21

or not until I try your case and see whether I put you on

22

probation.

23
24
25

You say, "Just a minute, you want a jury

"I may decide to put you on probation so if I do you
wouldn’t be entitled to a jury trial.
"So I will have to try you first to see if I give you
9

1

probation then we will call, a jury.

2

That is what that action means in. a case like that.

3

Now this man to start out with

it is a lot more

4

serious, I guess — I have never been tried in a criminal case

5

or any other kind

but I do believe this, that a man either has

6

a right to a jury

trial in this kind of case or ha doesn’t have

7

it.

8

criminal contempt.

I don’t know whether ha does or not.

He is charged with

8

The punishment might have been three years and his

10

having to serve the five —■ it could go up to five, I think.

11

Anyway, when he walked up there and said, "Judge, 1 want a

12

jury trial," I. don't think

13

this frankly — I

14

whatever of what a jury would or wouldn't do because no one

15

does, but at the same time I think the jury might turn him

IS

loose.

17

— of course, I want to tell you

wouldn’t even claim I had any knowledge

But they might not.
Regardless of that he had that right and he had a right

18

to say, "I want 12 men to say by unanimous verdict that I am

19

guilty of a crime or I am not guilty of a crimine."

20

man, of course, to whom it doesn't make any difference.

Here is a

Now, there is one other thing,

Now there is a ease cited here in that opinion of

the Court of Appeals.

4

Some of those people get bciptized and believe they can find some

kind of doodle-bug or something, you would have to kill them not

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER L. STRAUSS
ON BEHALF QE‘ TEE RESPONDENT
MR. STRAUSS;

At the indictment which was brought

21

against Petitioner in 1953 or 1954 and,on which he was original! y

22

convicted, specified as the period of the offenses for which

23

he was convicted, the broad offense for which he was convicted,

24

the same period on which this injunction and this contempt

25

violation is based.

So as far as we know there is not a contention of

having continued beyond 1952 when this injunction was ended»

3

There is some indication in the record at page 231,

I believe, that was not reproduced in the appendix, that in

adjudication of contempt

that principally through advertisements in the Tulsa, Oklahoma,

These advertisements promised a high level of

earnings in a rather short period of time. It is true that
the transaction was couched in terms of a note but the trial
court found, and there is

jio

contest, it appeared, of couese,

that this was really a thin disguise — the Petitioner had

I

no intention of replaying ehe note he gave and consequently
the transaction should be viewed as in fact a violation of
the injunction which the SEC had obtained against hirn in
1952 »
VJhile the injunction was obtained by default there
is no question that the Petitioner was not in the first place
served, of course, before the injunction proceedings and in
the second place, personally served with a copy of the
injunction after the injunction was entered.
I should also say or it should be quite clear that

:

Petitioner is not and never has been subjected either to a

three-year jail term or to the threat of such a term.

"It is adjudged that imposition of sentence be

That is in the

You can find language to the same effect in the court
order at page 25 and 27 of the appendix.
The court's reference to the suspension of the

51

imposition of sentence indicates that it Weis acting according

12

to Section 3651 of Title IS and therefore, that it had imposed

13

no sentence.

14

It is the Government's view of this case, particulari}

15

since it arose after this court's decision in Cheff

16

Schnackenberg -- this court's decision came down June 6, the

17

order to show cause was issued June 16, both in 1966, the

18

hearing on the jury demand was held on July 22 and the final

19

order of sentence came on .September 1st — so that the

20

Government position is that once that case had been decided,

21

in fact, any time a jury demand was refused by Federal Court in

22

a contempt case the court was thereby ruling that it would

23

try the case as a petty offense.

24
25

v.

So that from the moment the jury demand was refused
we take the position and we have conceded all along the
13

!

\

possible penalties which could bs imposed in this case were

2

limited to those which could be imposed under this court's

3

decision in Chaffy that is to say, any punishment which would

4

be possible for a petty offense under the U. S. Code and the

5

Constitution.

6

So that the Government's position can be stated very

7

briefly.

8

patty offenses which do not require a jury trial although they

0

may be criminal in nature.

Under this Court's case there does exist a class of

While in general the court has investigated the

10
11

nature of the offense as well as the penalty, I provided for

12

it in determining whether to classify any particular offenses

13

studied in this constitutional sense it determined in Cheff

54

that the nature of criminal contempt was not such as to require

15

jury trial in this case.

l.

Criminal contempt might be in some cases a petty

16

17

offense.

Therefore, the court said as recently as last year

13

in Bloom that it would treat criminal contempt as a petty

19

offense unless the punishment imposed makes it a serious

20

offense.

'

We assume that this frames the issue in this case,

21

22

whether three years of probation is such a serious punishment

23

as to have required a trial by jury, a punishment which could

24

not be authorised for a petty offense.

25

.

Our position is that the punishment is both a

14

i

1

statutory punishment for petty offenses and constitutional

2

punishment for petty offenses and, therefore, no jury trial

3

is required.

4

Q

Why do you say that?

S

A

In the statutory sense, first the Federal

6

Probation statute which is Section 3651 of Title 18, states

7

without any qualification -hat any offense which is not

8

punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty may insteat

9

be treated by a sentence of probation, and then states that

10

that term of probation, shall not exceed five years.

11

this without qualification,

12

13

It states

Of course a petty offense, since that is defined as
an offense by Section 1 of Title 18 —

14

Q

That is five years, isn't it?

15

A

The statute does authorize the imposition of

16

a probation of five years in petty offenses.

17

correct.

18

That is

That is our position.
Q

Suppose he wasn't on probation, what would you

20

A

If he were in jail?

21

0

Yes.

22

A

Quite planly it would be improper.

19

23

say then?

no statutory authorization for five years.

24

25

There is

Q

Between probation and a sentence that has to

be served?

15

't

2

A

We do draw that distinctione

More importantly,

we believe Congress has drawn that distinction.

On the question of appeal of a sentence on

4

probation where we reject the very argument you made about

5

the rights of people?

8

constraint or not.

I think you are referring to Jones v.
The issue there was whether there was any

9

Q

What did we hold?

10

A

You held there was constraint.

11

We do not

deny there is constraint in this case.
-

However, Your Honor, the Court last term indicated

12

13

that it would view not only, it seems to me, the fact of

14

constraint itself but the seriousness of the constraint.
Q

15
16

constraint for three years?
A

17
18

It is pretty serious, isn’t it, to be under

I think one has to take into account the sort

of constraints that are involved.
Q

19

What about reporting every Monday and have to

20

tell everything you do, you are subjected to be called by the

2!

judge at any time if he thinks you violated?
A

22

I think most of us would prefer that than to

23

have to report every morning at six o'clock in the cell

24

block.

25

Q

It might be a little less.

16

j

A

1

I agree that is the question in this case, how

2

much less is it.

less.

It is our position that it is sufficiently

What if he were on probation for 10 years?

5

A

Thankfully, we don't have to argue that case»

It is a logical descendant of this one, isn't

A

No, Your Honor, it is not, for this reasons

7

it?

8
9

In 'the Bloom case, last term the majority opinion which you

10

joined indicated that the Court's first reference in cases

ii

such as these would be the practice of the Nation as a

12

whole,, would be an objective record.
This really is quite consistent with what has been

historically its approach.

As far back as District of Columbia

v. Clawans the Court said in judging the question of the
seriousness of the penalty and I quote, this is page 628,
".doubt be resolved not subjectively by recourse of the judge
to his own sympathy and emotions but by objective standards
such as may be observed in the laws and practices of the
community taken as a gauge of its social and ethical
judgment."
If we look at Section 3401 of the United States
Code, for example, we find that it is quite clear that
Congress has made the provisions of the Federal Probation
Act applicable to petty offenses.
17

5

Q

And to others?

2

A

And to others as well, but to petty offenses in

3
4
5
6
7

particular, which is the question here.
I think it is a question whether this is too serious
a punishment.
Q

Suppose the punishment at any time is over

three years, would that be considered serious?

8

A

I am not sure I understand the question.

9

Q

Say he has a five-year sentence.

10

A

To probation or jail?

11

Q

1 am not talking about probation.

12

13

A five-

year sentence.
A

Any sentence to jail in excess of six months

14

under the contempt case under this Court1s ruling in Cheff

15

would be improper.

16

Let me put it another way if I may.

Let us suppose

17

that Mr. Frank in this case had been sentenced not to three

13

years on probation but had been sentenced to six months at

IS

hard labor on the rock pile of a maximum security prison

20

with solitary confieraent and a diet of a disciplinary standard.

21

I don.'t suppose that we would be in a very good

22

position coming in here to argue to this Court that that

23

sentence fit within the six-month standard which this Court

24

had announced in Chef£.

25

It is not only the duration of the sentence which
18

I

c

I

may indicate what its seriousness is.

2

point is that this Court has indicated and quite properly so?

3

that it will make up its mind on these issues by referring

4

to national practice rather than to its own feelings about

5

the issue.

6

Again 1 think the main

And national practice in the first instance, the

1

Federal Probation Act in the second instance, the survey of

8

State law which we have made in our brief, it seems to us

9

indicate that a three-year term of probation for a minor

'50
11

offense is not at all out of the ordinary.
Q

I understand that until the judge actually

12

sentences, imposes the jail sentence, you don’t know how

13

serious he considered the sentence to be?

14

A

I wouldn't take that position at this point.

15

Q

And if he had imposed a sentence for contempt

IS

of two years in jail and then suspended it you would say under

17

Cheff that is improper?

18

A

I would say under Cheff
that is improper.
-

19

I also say under Cheff that once a judge has denied

20

jary trial, if he then at least goes on without giving any

21

indication that he did not understand that opinion, once he

22

has denied a jury trial he has lira!ted himself to six months.

23
24
25

Q

The trouble I have is two years later he

violates his parole, the judge gives him six months.
A

That is a possibility.
19

*s

Q

Isn* t that violation of Chaff, because I under­

2

stand Cheff says you can't give anything more than six months.

3

So here you have given six months plus two years or

4

probation.
A

5

8

That is the problem I have,
I agree that that is the problem.

I am not

sure that the Court's opinion resolved that problem.

7

I did have the chance to look at some statistics

S

on that question which may be relevant in this same report

9

of the Administrative Offices of D. S, Courts regarding persons

10

under supervision in the Federal Probation System which we cite

11

with respect to practice.

i

It gives some indication of the removal from

12
13

probation.

It shows, generally speaking, only one out, of every

14

seven probationers is ever removed.

15

Q

The judge would not have to give six months.

16

A

He would not. have to.

17

Q

He could give lass?

18

A

He could give less.

19

While we agree that is the possibility that ought

i

20

to be taken into account in assessing the seriousness, I don't

21

think it should be made conclusive.

22

Q

Mr, Strauss, is there explicit authority for

23

suspending the imposition of sentence?

24

I know it is done.

25

A

Yes, I believe there is.
20

Explicit authority.

I believe it is found

in the Federal Probation Act in Section 3651 of that Act.

Any court

I think this Comet, for example, in the case of
Roberts v. Unite:! States, which I believe is in 342 US, drew
t.iat distinction.

11

Q

Let us suppose that this Petitioner violated

12

probation, then I suppose he could come in and one of two

13

things could happen.

14

at that time under the reserve power or he could be punished

15

for violation of probation..

16

Either the sentence could be imposed

. Is that right?

17

A

I am not sure I follow you.

18

Q

Suppose the Petitioner violated probation,

19

he just didn't report when he was supposed to report or he

20

went out and robbed a bank in violation of the terms of his

21

probation.

He is brought in before the judge.

22

Nov; what can the judge do?

23

A

24
25

The judge in this particular circumstance may

revoke probation although he is not required to do so.
Q

What is the consequence of revoking probation

He than proceeds to sentence him, which he had

previously suspended.

a
9

No, he suspended the imposition of sentence.

Nov/, can he also punish him for violating the probation?
A

No.

I take it that if it were a penal offense

that would require a criminal trial in itself.
Q

So, the only thing he can do at that time is

to impose sentence for the initial offense?

50

A

That is right.

15

Q

It is your theory then that the most he could

12

impose then would be six months in jail?

13

A

That is right.

14

G

I think Justice Brennan asked you this, but

15

if he used a different form of judgment and imposed the

16

sentence of three years and then suspended it, you say the

17

consequences would be different and that then he would have

ta

to retry him?

19
20
21

22
23

A

We think that would affirmatively show that

he had misunderstood this Court’s ruling in Cheff.
Q

Or that he had decided this was more than a. pettv

offense and deserved more punishment than six months?
A

I take it, Your Honor, if that should ever

24

occur to a judge in the course of a trial for contempt, what

25

he would probably do is declare a mistrial at this point and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER L. STRAUSS

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6

MR. STRAUSS:

(RESUMED)

Mav it please the Court, I should

7

perhaps for a minute discuss Section 3691 of Title 18 since

8

counsel raised the question.
This was one of the principal grounds for argument in

9

to

the Court below although it was not raised in the Certiorari

1?

petition.

12

Basically the question there, as X think the counsel

13

recognizes, is whether this was an. action brought by or on

14

behalf of the U.S. or not.

15
16
17
18
19

If it was not brought on behalf o£ the U.S., the jury!
trial was required under that Section.
If it was brought on behalf of the U.S., the jury
trial was not required.
In fact, the civil action was brought in the name

20

of the Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent

21

agency of the United States Government.

22

would be that an action brought by that agency was not one

23

brought on behalf of the United States.

24
25

So that the argument

Very briefly, I think the legislative history of
the provision which has been before the Court before makes it

24

1

plain that none of the sponsors thought they were

2.

distinguishing between actions involving the U.S. and actions

3

involving one of its agencies.

4

The principal concern of the statute was with the

5

use of injunctions in labor cases between private parties

6

to press one side of the dispute and remarks were made to the

7

effect that the enactment left all powers that exist in the

S

Government at present undisturbed by its passage.

9

There is no extensive case law on the subject

10

principally because I think all courts to which the question

11

has been presented have treated it as summarily as did the

12

Tenth Circuit below, simply stating that of course enaction

13

brought by an agency of the United States was one brought on

14

behalf of the United States.

15

Q

Who else could it be brotighfc on behalf of?

16

A

No one else.

17
18

19
20

But I thought that should be made

clear.
Q

The caption here is Frank against the U.S.

How did the caption get changed?
A

The contempt action was brought by an attorney

21

for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United

22

States Attorney acting together.

23

As it was a criminal action I suppose it would be

24

under the caption U.S. v. Frank.

25

which is what would be relevant to 3691, was brought in the

25

But the original injunction,

i-

?

name of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2

As I was saying before at lunch hour, we feel that

3

the basic mode of decision as to the comparative seriousness

4

of the probation in this case was set out by this Court last

5

term in Bloom and earlier than that in Clawan, that is

6

the consultation of the lav/s and practices of the Nation to

7

see what comparisons had been drawn.

3

9

In general, and as we set out in our brief, we did
attempt such a study.

It was a study complicated by sub­

10

stantial variance which this Court noted last term and State

11

practice regarding the affording of jury trials with the sorts

12

of offenses that concern us here.

Ii

I

13

\

Q

Does that mean in every one of these cases that

►

V'

14

are similar on their facts that we must examine the records to

15

see what the severity o£ the probation conditions is?

t

i

16

A

No, Your Honor, I don’t think so.

Our point is

17

that the question of equivalency is primarily a gegislative

18

judgment and that if we can show that the judgment made by one

19

legislature, in this case the Congress, is within the general

20

scope of the laws

21

then that is sufficient to defend the judgment.

22

and practices of the Nation as a whole,

In fact, it seems to me that, it might be the converse.

23

If you asked about the particular probation imposed in the

24

particular case you might get into just the problem which

25

concerns you.
26

Q

1

1 understood you to answer Justice Black to

2

the effect that these particular conditions were not onerous

3

and that it might be different if they had been,
A

4
5

No, I think I was trying to make a slightly

different point,

6

Q

1 see.

All right.

7

A

From this perspective, of looking at the

6

National scheme as a whole, we think the results are quite

9

striking.

10
11

There are only 12 jurisdictions which limit the

probation terra to the same extent as penal terms.
On the other hand, 15 provide, as does the Federal

12

statute, for a. maximum period of probation of five years

13

without regard to the offense committed.

14

There are nine jurisdictions in which the question

15

is left to the Court's discretion and the remainder provide for

IS

a maximum between one and three years with the great majority

17

in the upper half of that range.

18

While we were able to supply the Court with figures

19

regarding the practice of U.S, Commissioners in probation cases

20

which indicates that they regularly impose probation sentences,

21

probation terras I should say, in excess of six months, which,

22

of course, is the limit of their authority as far as jail

23

sentences are concerned under the Code, we have been unable to

24

obtain such figures for the Nation as a whole.

25

Q

Do 1 understand you, Mr. Strauss, to say in
27

!

1

response to a question by Mr. Justice Black that if the

2
3

probation period here had been five years you might regard it
differently?

4
5

A

I believe his question was whether I would regard

it differently if the probation period was 10 years.

S

Q

Would you?

7

A

Yes.

8
9
10
11
12

There is nostatutory

authorisation

that I am aware of for such a term.
Q

Forget that.

Let us suppose that there were no

limitation whatever on the length of time of the probation.
Would you regard 10 years as different for purposes of
our problem?

13

A

Yes, I would.

14

Q

How about five years?

15

A

No, I do notregard

18

Q

Eight years?

17

A

I would regard eight years as different.

18

Q

Six?

19

A

I would regard six years as different.

20

Q

Then I don't get you.

21

A

The point is that this Court admonished last

fiveyears.

22

term in the Bloom case that we are to look to the Nation's Law

23

and practices; looking to the Nation's law and practices, we

24

find the regular legislative practice of authorizing probation

25

terms up to five years.
28

1

Q

That doesn't answer the question.

2

The question is whether a three-year probation period

3

should be assimilated to the six-month petty offense concept

4

in Cheff against Schnackenberg.

\

Would you agree that that is the question before

5
6

7

A

Yes.

8

Q

Now if I correctly understand you, you said that

9

you would assimilate five years to it, for whatever reason,

10

you would assimilate five years to it but you would not

11

assimilate six years to it.
A

12

What I have been trying to do is to apply those

13
14

tests which the Court set out last term.
0

15
18
17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

I think the reason is important. Your Honor.

I know7, but those are not tests of what is and

what is not to be regarded as a petty offense for purposes of
contempt.
What you are calling our attention to is nothing more
than the maximum period for a probation order.
Wow that assumes what may be a question that we
have to decide, whether a probation order, provided it is
for a permissible period, is to be regarded as in effect a
sentence that is no more deserving of jury consideration than
a petty offense.
It seems to me that reference to the maximum permitted
29

1

time upon which a person may be placed on. probation does not

2

provide us with a guide for this purpose which is, shall the

3

three-year probation here be assimilated to the six months'

4

sentence, six months’ imprisonment, called petty offense for

5

purpose of Cheff against Schnaokenberg.

6

A

It is true, Yoiir Honor, 1 have assumed that the

7

constitutional questions which were decided last fcex*m in

8

Bloom and Duncan were the questions which principally would

9

be decided in connection with what I agree is strictly speaking

*

50

a question of Cheff v. Schnaekenberg which was not as stated

i!

a constitutional decision.

12

What I have been trying to do is to present the case

1.3

in terms of the criteria that the Court stated it would look

14

to in deciding the constitutional question.

15
16

Those criteria were in the words of the Court
■
objective criteria, chiefly the existing lav/s and practices

17

in the State.

m

Q

I know, but your adversary points out that

19

this man during the period of his probation, is required to

20

report every Monday, he is required to notify the authorities

21

when he changes jobs.

22

I suppose if he is arrested for whatever offense,

23

then his whole probation is in danger.

24

hot to spit on the sidewalk or things of that sort.

25

Isn’t that right?
30

He has to be careful

1

A

Yes, that is right.

2

Q

The question is whether that is or is not fee

3

he regarded as in the same light as a petty offense, as

4

defined in Cheff against Sehnackenberg and in the statutes

5

for purposes of jury trial in a contempt case.

6

Even if the States all permitted probation without

7

limit I don*t think that would settle it, just as if it

8

would not settle it in ray mind if the State said that two

3

years is the maximum.

10

A

There may be several ways inwhich I can answer

11

that.

One is that there is a basic statutory authorization

12

involved here, Section 3401 of Title 18, which, as we have

13

indicated, is an authorization which is frequently used by

14

United States Commissioners.

15

Q

For petty offenses?

16

A

For petty offenses necessarily.

17

Over 50 percent of the petty offense probation

IS

terms are in excess of six months, over 25 percent are in

1®

excess of one year.

20

practical authorization for this practice.

In fact, in practice there is statutory,

The second argument is a policy argument, if that

21

22

makes any difference, has to do with the nature of probation,

23

itself.

24

to be sure probation is not a punitive device,

25

that anyone subjected to probation views it as such.

While it is backed up by the threat of punishment

31

I do not believe

i

1

If he has his choice he takes the probation and in

2

effect,, as I think the Court appreciates, any defendant

3

preferring to go to jail for six months would be able to co

4

so.
i

5

Even if the law did not authorize him to refuse

3

the conditions of probation he could announce it to the court

7

and say, "I am going out and the first thing I am going to

8

do is disobey them."

9

10

So in practice terms one is talking about an alter­
native which is somewhat within the defendant's control.

II

As this Court has recognized in the past, probation

12

is a rehabilitative device.

13

long it should be is made on the basis of rehabilitative

14

considerations.

15

Q

Really the decision as to how

That is said about prison, too.

It may be

15

kind of whimsical but it is the theory of why we put people

17

in jail.

18

is called purposes of rehabilitation.

19

It is a deterrent to them and others and for what

A

If I may respond to that, Your Honor — I see

20

my time is up -- that is a theory but it is only part of the

21

theory as to imprisonment.

22

Legislatures frankly vary the amount of imprisonment

23

they provide for crimes in direct relationship to their view

24

of the seriousness of the crime involved.

25

That is not done in general with respect to probation.
32

1

So that we submit that the probation in this case was

2

authorized by statute.

3

out last term in Duncan and Bloom.

4

disposition for this case and consequently the judgment below

5

should be affirmed.

6

Q

It meets the test which the Court set
It was an appropriate

Mr. Strauss, if you are going to count probation

7

as equivalent to a sentence or prison term, I suppose if you

3

suspended imposition of sentence and were going to put a man

9

on probation you could only put him on probation for six

10

months if you were going to count, probation as equivalent to a

11

prison term.

12

A

13

Your Honor.

14

Q

I suppose it would have to be less than that,

It would have to be less than that, either that

15

or if at the end of five months he violated his probation and

16

he came in for a sentence he would only be sentenced for a

17

month.

1®

A

You would have a sort of declining

19

Q

That is right.

If you sentenced him to six

20

months, imposed a six months1 sentence and then if you wanted

21

to suspend execution --

22

A

You couldn't do that.

23

Q

You couldn’t do that?

24

A

No, you couldn't.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. OGDEN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. OGDEN:

If the Court please, I will be very

4

brief because I have said all I think I care to say or should

5

say in connection with this matter, but here is a man, for

S

example, who has already been under probation roughly two

7

years.

S
3
10

Then suppose he violates that and they bring him
back to Oklahoma City and they say, "You have violated your
probation.

11

I am going to sentence you to six months."
That, would be six months plus tw7o years on probation.

12

Whatever effect probation has or not, I am going to call this

13

to your attention.

14

I think, and I say this as a thought which actually

15

means nothing but it is just my opinion, that when a person

16

is put on probation for three years, if he makes a good citizen,

17

doesn't violate any of the terms until two years, 11 months, 2S

18

days, then they can take him and make him serve three years.

■

13

I think a lot of times maybe I get off the actual

20

point involved as I view it on that question, but ail there is

21

to it as I see it, and it probably isn't that simple, here is

22

a man charged with the crime.

23

You say why was he charged with a crime?

24

the statute makes it a crime and that is what the Court said

25

here, they found him guilty of the crime.
34

You say

So the Court said

I

I convict you»

2

I want to read here from this appendix and then I am

3

through on that part of it, "It is adjuged that the defendant

4

is guilty as charged and convicted.,"

3

said.

That is what the judge

Now, he was convicted.

6

Now, can you try a man and convict him of a crime and 1

7

if you will notice everything in here, the complaint, the

8

charge, everything, and the case criminal so and so, the

9

number of the case in the U. S., District Court was number so

10

and so criminal, criminal charge, the whole thing has been

11

treated as, and of course it is, a crimine, there is no question

12

about that.

t

Now then, I want to call to the Court’s attention

13
14

for emphasis' sake and I hope it is not burdensome to you, but

15

the statute itself should take care of this case.
■

The reason I say it should is because Title 18,

16
17

Article I, states:

"Offenses classified any offense punish­

18

able by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year

19

is a felony."
.

20

Now you try a man for a felony.

You say why do

21

you say that?

Because the punishment exceeds a year and when

22

it exceeds a year, death or punishment exceeding a year, then

23

it is a felony under the statute.

24

So a man has been tried here for a felony.

25

Mow the very next section says, “Any other offense
35

s

is a misdemeanor."
Now the last one., about this petty offense, this is

£

3

statutory, "Any misdemeanor, the penalty for which does not

4

exceed imprisonment for a period of six months" — if you

5

could imprison a man for six months and one day it is not a

6

petty offense — "or a fine not to exceed $500" — he could

7

fine him $501, it would not be •— "or both, is a petty

S
9
10

offense."
That is what the law says is a petty offense.
Then the Constitution says in all criminal

n

prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right of trail by

Now the question is %

Is this a criminal prosecution?

It certainly is not a civil action.
May I read what the judge said to this man.

I want

to call your attention to one other thing and that is it says
in the brief of the Solicitor General and it is in the
appendix, and here it is, it sets out in here the conditions
under which Mr. Frank had to serve for these three years.
Now I won't read them all.
"You shall refrain from violation of any law
{Federal, State or local).
"You s

11 get in touch immediately with your

probation officer if arrested or questioned by a law enforce­
ment officer.

maintain reasonble hours.
"You shall work regularly at your occupation and

support your legal dependents-if any, to the best, of your

ability.

officer at once and you shall consult him prior to changing

jobs o

When out of work you shall notify your probation

"You shall not leave the judicial district without
permission of the probation officer."

Oklahoma is divided in three districts, Northern,

11

Western and the Eastern Districts.

12

those three Districts.
He is in the Eastern District, up in Tulsa.

"You shall follow the probation officer's
instructions and advice.
"You shall report to the probation officer as

He

can't even leave that District without permission.

The State is divided in

Then he has to report at Oklahoma City the first

20

day of each month beginning October 1966 for three years and

21

fill out a report and send it by mail or bring the same to

22

the probation officer in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

23

"Your failure to comply with the instruction of

24

the court as outlined herin will be cause for the revocation

25

of your probation."

Now if the Court please, that is actually all I

2

care to say.

•a

to this case that it was a criminal case, and all over the

4

United States I guess every place I have been and know any­

5

thing about in the cities if they can fine a man over $20

6

they have to give him a jury trial.

It seems to me like to apply the Constitution

They believe at least, and that is the way they do,
because it is a constitutional provision.
Here is a man put on probation for three years; with
all these restrictions upon him.
Now then

he demanded in writing and orally a

12

trial jury and it was denied to him.

13

law as in this case and under the decision it didn't seem to

14

me, honestly, when I read it, that when this Court said, well,

15

we think we should tell these judges over the country when

18

a jury trial is demanded — you set it out there, I thought

17

it was plain as can be.

In closing, may I again thank Your Honors for
permitting me to appear.

It has been a great pleasure.

(Whereupon, at 12;55 p.m. the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
