ARGUMENT OF VICTOR RABINOWITZ, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS
MR. RABINOWITZ:

9

May it please the Court.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the three-judge

10

11

statutory court sitting in the southern district of New York

12

denying to plaintiffs an injunction and declaratory judgment

13

against the District Attorney of Queens County.
The plaintiffs sought an injunction and declaratory

14
15

judgment to enjoin their prosecution under the New York criminal

16

anarchy statute.
I think the relevant facts can be briefly stated.

17

18

On June 21, 1967, the 11 plaintiffs here were indicted, together

19

with a number of others, on charges of advocacy of criminal

20

anarchy, conspiracy to commit the crime of advocacy of criminal

21

anarchy.

22

premises to be used for assembly of anarchists.

23
24
25

Two of them were also charged with permitting their

The indictment was considerably broader than this
in that it had 48 counts, of which only five are before the
Court on this application.

The other 43 counts, all related
3

1

to specific crimes, most of them to the possession of guns

2

contrary to the law of the State of New York,
I think there is also a charge — one of the counts

3
4

relates to a conspiracy to commit the crime of arson.
The indictment here invoked the New York criminal

5

G

anarchy statute of 1902 which was first applied in the period

7

after the First World War, in the early ' 20' s,in the Gitlow

8

case and was not applied again until 1964 when it was applied

9

by New York State in the case of People against Epton.
This resurrection of a moribund statute in the

10
11

Epton case and the mass indictment in this case which follows

12

36 days after the Court of Appeals decision in Epton poses a

13

threat, we think, to the radical political activity of our

14

time and raises memories df the

15

those eras which clearly seem to us to be inconsistent with

16

modern Constitutional doctrines.

' 20's in the prosecution of

The plaintiffs brought this action and rely largely

17
18

on the general authority of this Court in cases such as

19

Dombrowski and cases which have followed and,so far as declara­

20

tory judgment is concerned, in Zwickler against Koota.
Q

21

22

Do you think the narrowing crux that the Court

gave the statute in Epton meets the

Constitutional problems?

23

A

24

We argue — I, of course, will come to that in a

25

moment.

No, sir.

It is a major part of this case — that the statute
4

1

both on its face and as construed in Gitlow, is both vague and

2

overbroad and is clearly unconstitutional and I don't think

3

there is any argument about that.
The Court of Appeals in New York held, as this Court

4
5

has held on a number of occasions, that Gitlow case is no longer

6

law.

7

and held it was clearly unconstitutional.

This Court discussed this very statute at some length

However, the defendant argues that the New York

8
9

Court of Appeals in Epton, by means of a narrow construction,

10

corrected the defect.

This view was accepted by the three-

11

judge court.

12

narrowing the construction, said that, "Well, we think now that

13

the legislative intent of 1902 was to write a Constitutional

14

statute and of course Constitutional doctrines changed a good

15

deal since that time so we will now say that the legislature

16

in 1902 intended to conform to existing Constitutional standards

The New York Court of Appeals in its opinion,

The three-judge

17

court echoed this somewhat over-

18

dramatically saying, "If the 1902 legislature had known it coulr

19

not have all it wanted, it would have wanted all it could have.’

20

On the basis of this it held the narrowing construction of

21

of the Gitlow statute Constitutional.
There are two primary questions raised on this

22

23

phase of the case.

24

construction in Epton is binding on the plaintiffs in this case

25

at all.

The first is whether that narrowing

The overt acts charged in this indictment all took

if

1

place before the narrowing construction.
As I say, the indictment here was only 36 days after

2

3

the decision of the Court in the Epton case.

4

plaintiffs in this case had any notice at all of the of the

5

narrowing construction that the Court of Appeals in New York

6

was going to — obviously they couldn't tell — read into the

7

statute.

8
9

None of the

We submit that the plaintiffs can no more be charged
with clairvoyance, if I may echo what this Court said just a

10

couple of weeks ago in Schuttleworth, as to the plastic surgery

11

that the Court of Appeals would apply to the Gitlow statute

12

than Shuttleworth could be charged with knowing what the

13

Supreme Court of Alabama was ultimately going to decide in

14

the ordinance under consideration in that case.

15

Q

Are you coming back to the jurisdictional questioi,

16

the Dombrowski point?

17

A

Does Your Honor mean the question of the

18

injunction', the propriety of an injunction, the Cameron against

19

Johnson problem?

20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

I am talking about the point discussed in Judge

Friendly's opinion and the question of whether Dombrowski,
authorized Dombrowski, or any other decision of this Court,
in fact, authorizes the maintenance of this action.
A

Well --

Q

I just wonder.

I just invite you to discuss it

6

1

if you see fit»

2

A

Yes, sir.

3

Now, I certainly shall, Your Honor.

4

We feel that, as I say, the overt act charged here,

5

as it were, the

6

State of New York, assuming that the New York Court of Appeals

7

had the right to do this at all.

8

of the State of New York until after the Epton decision and

9

we do not believe that the narrowing construction of the

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

It certainly was not the law

defendant can be held — or the plaintiff in this case -liable for that.
Furthermore, even in the

12

13

narrowing construction was not the law of the

Fjpton case the Court of

Appeals reconstrued only Subdivision 1 of the criminal anarchy
law and left Subdivisions 3 and 4 untouched, so that as to those
statutes, those sections of the statutes, which are specifically
alleged in the indictment in this case, were not construed at
all.
I submit that the doctrine, the statute which is
clearly unconstitutional, which everyone admits is unconstitu­
tional, can be reconstrued by the highest court of the State,
is really a most dangerous doctrine. It means that any State
can always resurrect a statute which has been declared

unconsti

tutional by this Court and without any notice to the persons
within the State, make a silent statute, an invisible statute,
a dead statute, again, come to life.

7

This is much more extreme than the situation in

t
2

Schuttleworth because in that case the unconstitutional interpre

3

tation was pronounced by the Commissioner of Public Safety and

4

Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out that that was not too reliable

an interpretation.
Here we have an interpretation by the Court of Appeals

This Court, in Keyishian, said

The New York — said the Gitlow

statute, as interpreted in Gitlow, as read by Gitlow, was an
improper, unconstitutional statute.
This Court said so in Keyishian.

said so in this case.

States.

6

the United States, in the Keyishian case, said that this

7

specific statute --

8
9
10

Q

Well, that statute was before the Court in the

Gitlow case.
A

Yes, sir.

Discussed the statute that was

11

before the Court in the Gitlow case and said that it was —

12

said it in rather strong language, I think — clearly impermis­

13

sible under qurrent Constitutional standards and it discussed

14

Subdivision 3 which is one of the sections here and said that

15

under the statute as interpreted by Gitlow a man walking down

16

the campus with a copy of Karl Marx’s doctrine might be

17

violating the law.
I believe that was the example used by the Court in

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

the Keyishian case.

So, it will not be argued here today that

the Gitlow interpretation is any longer a valid interpretation
under the doctrine — even in Venice, for that matter, because
even in Venice, in that opinion, suggested that the Gitlow case
was really

doubtful and is inconsistent, as I say, with a

large range of cases —• the Scales case and the whole range of
Constitutional decisions in the last 10 years of this Court.
9

So, I think that the situation is very similar to the

t
2

Schuttleworth case.

There, there was — and I am paraphrasing

3

the decision of the Court, but I think it is the same paraphrase

4

that Mr. Justice Harlan used — this Court held that where a

5

statute is interpreted in an unconstitutional fashion by the

6

Commissioner of Public Safety, that Mr. Schuttleworth had the

7

right to treat that statute as void and could not be charged

8

with clarivoyance, that the Court would later hold that the

9

Commissioner of Public Safety was wrong.
Here we have, not the chief of police giving the

10
11

statute an unconstitutional interpretation, the New York

12

Court of Appeals giving what is today an unconstitutional

13

interpretation, although, obviously, at the time of the Gitlow

14

decision, ipso facto, it was a Constitutional interpretation

15

because the Court so said.

' v

Q

16

Of course, the point of the Schuttleworth case
i

17

was a little bit different, as you know.

It involved the fact

18

that the licensing authority could not be charged with clair­

19

voyance, thatthe licensing authority felt that he had absolutely

20
21

unbridled discretion in the question of whether or not to
grant a license for a parade.
It wasn't so much the

22
23
24
25

petitioner's clarivoyance.

At least that is the way I understood the opinion and I did
write it.
A

I know you did write it, Your Honor.
10

If that

1

is the way you interpret it, obviously, that is what it must

2

mean.

3

clairvoyance for anyone to perceive that this language meant

4

what the Supreme Court of Alabama was destined to find that

5

it meant more than four years later."

The language is, "It would have taken extraordinary

4

6

Q

Right.

7

A

I misread it if that is what Your Honor meant.

8

Nov/, we feel that the Epton gloss on the statute

9
10
11

still leaves it unconstitutional and this comes to Your Honor's,
Mr. Justice Harlan's, question.

guidance as to what may or may not be done under the statute.
One of the most serious defects in the Court of

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

Appeals'interpretation in the Epton case relates to the clear
and present danger, a rather unsatisfactory test under the best
of circumstances.

21

22
23
24
25

At least in the Dennis case, in applying

the clear and present danger test, the Court clearly said that
there must be a clear and present danger of an overthrow of the
government of the United States.
In the Epton case the Court found it quite sufficient

19

20

There is still no clear

that there was a finding of clear and present danger to commit
a riot.

Now, if all that the clear and present danger test

means in the eyes of the New York Court of Appeals and if that
is the gloss placed on the statute now, is that the crime of
sedition requires only that there be a clear and present danger
of disorder, which is a far cry from the overthrow of the
11

1

government of the United States or even the overthrow of the

2

government of New York, then I submit that we still have a

3

statute that is unconstitutional even under the Epton decision.
Now, in Dombrowski this Court held that it will not

4
5

abstain, in a case such as this, such as was presented in

6

Dombrowski, where the policy reasons were operated against it,

7

and one of the elements in the policy considerations or among

8

the elements in the policy considerations in Dombrowski, which

9

motivated the Court in deciding against the doctrine of absten­

10

tion, was that this was a First Amendment situation, that it

11

did involve a statute which, to refer to those words which

12

have perhaps been a little overused, it did have a chilling

13

effect on those —- I can't help it, Mr. Justice.

14

says that.
It did have a chilling effect on the operation of

15
16
17
18

Everybody

people who are engaged in political activity and that the
statute was of such a nature that it would require repeated
application, that the exact meaning of the statute would have

19

to be hammered out in repeated prosecutions over a long period

20

of time in the State courts if the doctrine of abstention was

21

followed.

22

Q

Is it your position that anytime people are

23

prosecuted or indicted and under indictment in a State on

account of the conduct that lias within the broad First

the issuance of a declaratory judgment under Dombrowski?

3

A

Well, has authority to issue, to consider the

4

application for an injunction under Dombrowski and I would say

5

Mrs. Piel will argue this a little more fully ---

been indicted by the State and that the indictment relates to

A

I would say where the State is prosecuting —

17

and I may be getting back to the same point, Your Honor.

18

am not going to try to spell it out — in a First Amendment

19

area and where the circumstances are such as to cast appall,

20

inhibit the free exercise of First Amendment rights, guaranteed

21

22
23
24
25

I

by the First Amendment and the 14th, that in that kind of a
situation the Federal Court has jurisdiction to determine whether
the state is a constitutional statute and whether it should,
under all of the standards that are set forth, on the one hand
in Dombrowski and on the other hand in Douglas against Jeannette,
13

i

whether it should or should not abstain.
Q

2
3

Well, could you suggest to me a First Amendment

situation which would not fall within that category?
A

4

Well, I am not sure, for example, that an obsenity

5

case would fall within that category,

I don't believe that

6

the chilling effect of a vague obsenity statute would be the

7

kind of thing that would cast appall on political activities

8

within the meaning of the Dombrowski case,

9

Q

Does that have to be political activities?

10

A

I would say it has to be, certainly, First

11

Amendment activities and I would say — considering when we

12

are talking about casting appall on the carrying on of activi­

13

ties -- I would say that probably it would have to be political

14

activities.

15

to an obsenity case.

At least I would have difficulty in extending it

Is that because of the chilling,

10

the gun statutes, the arson statutes, the murder statutes and

all these other things — to take care of a situation such as

12

this and there doesn’t seem to be any requirement in order to

13

protect the interest of the State while it must impose on top

14

of this a sedition statute phrased in the very broad and general

15

terms of the New York statute.

16
17
18
19

Now, there are other points which I think are set off
in the brief and I am sharing my time here with counsel in the
consolidated case.

There is, of course, the supersession point

discussed in the Nelson case which I think is adequately briefed

20

and which is involved in the next case, Harris against Younger,

21

as well as in this one.

22
23
24
25

Finally, there is the argument of the problem of
the effect of Section 42, U. S. Code 1983 on 28, U. S. 2283.
That is the question of whether the Civil Rights Act is an
exception to the provision of the judiciary code with respect

granting injunctions.

That issue has been before this Court.

It has been argued by this Court so many times that I really

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Mrs. Piel.

ARGUMENT OF ELEANOR JACKSON PIEL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT
MRS. PIEL:

If it please the Court.

My client is one of the 15 persons indicted in this
case and he has somewhat of a unique position because, although
there are 48 counts to the indictment, he is charged with
three counts of the substantive anarchy, one of the conspiracy
to commit anarchy and one count which, by itself, does not
seem very serious but is conspiracy to commit arson in the

16

1

2

third degree»
Now, this will become significant in terms of my

3

argument, although it may not be as significant as to the other

4

appellants in this case.

5

Q

You said there is one count of conspiracy --

6

A

To commit arson in the third degree.

7

Q

No, the one before that.

8

Conspiracy, I think

you said, to commit anarchy.

9

A

Yes.

to

Q

I didn't know that anarchy was something you

11
1
13

could commit.
A

There are four --

I thought that was a state of existence.
I had such a long association with anarchy I

finally decided that perhaps committing is the --

14

Q

Which count?

15

A

Five.

16

Q

Five.

A

No, four is the conspiracy to commit anarchy

17
18

19

Do you remember the number.

and the fifth one is arson.
Interestingly enough, you will note that the overt

0

acts that all through the anarchy counts you find the dissemina

1

tion of ideas is by word, by distributing pamphlets, you find

22
3
4
5

assemblage.
You find that kind of thing all the way through.
I want to get back to what we claimed in this appeal. This is
a double-barreled attack, not only on the anarchy statutes, but
17

1

also on the grand jury statutes in the State of New York.

I want to go back a little bit to the history with

regard to this anarchy statute and what happened to it.
It was passed, as you know, in 1902.

-They

It came to

glory, as it were, in 1920 when, in February, Mr. Gitlow was

10

convicted of anarchy, even though, as you will all recall, he

11

was a socialist.

12

It went through the New York Court of Appeals in 1922 j
•!
when that Court gave a ringing opinion saying that the State

13

14
15
16

had a right to protect, not only itself, but the government of
the United States from subversion.

It was approved by this

Court in 1925 in an opinion which specifically excluded the
i

17

concept of clear and present danger.
That statute was never invoked inthe State of New

York again until the summer of 1964 when William Epton was
indicted by a grand jury in August by

the same white, middle-

class, set up under the same statute that we are challenging
here.
Then there is something that has not been argued
in any of the briefs.

In fact I really just came across it.

In 1945, after Epton had been indicted, the legislature of the

18

1
p

State of New York met and amended the anarchy law, left out
"force" with regard to the overthrow, simplified it a great

•J

deal and also said that the anarchy had to only be directed

against the State of New York.

I say that it is quite unusual that you have the

Q

20

By the way, do you challenge here the Constitu­

21

tionality of the gloss that the Court did put on the statute

22

in Epton?
A

23

I certainly do and I will very briefly tell you

24

why.

The gloss that the Court put on the Epton statute misses,

25

in one respect which has already been mentioned, and that is
20

at

1

that it doesn't give fair warning to those persons

before who

2

committed acts before the Court told them what the statute

3

said.

4

Q

Well, how about people today though?

5

A

All right, as to people today, it seems to me

6

that it misses an important aspect that this Court said Dennis

7

meant when it spoke in Yates.

8

of the clear and present danger of the overthrow of the govern

9

ment

It said that one of the aspects

or the force and violence had to evolve a group or a

to

person joining a group which was of sufficient strength to

11

actually accomplish the end and that was never mentioned by

12

the Court in Epton.

Q

Do you raise that question up here — the

Constitutionality of the statute as narrowed in Epton?
A

I don't know whether I did it adequately but

I certainly am raising it here.
Q

You didn't argue it in your brief, did you?

A

I didn't argue it just that way.

Q

Well, in any way?

A

Yes, I said that this case was distinguished

from Dennis.

I think there are different principles applying

to a Federal statute having to do with overthrow of the
government and a State statute.
Furthermore, I think that something that Mr. Justice
Warren said very clearly in the Nelson case, and that was that

S

Actually, that is what the legislature of the State

7

of New York thought to a degree, not completely, because they

8

didn't think that a person could talk about overthrow of the

government of the United States.

10

Q

But, in any event, 1 gather the Constitutionality

11

of the narrowed statute is raised squarely in the other cases,

12

also, in the case that has just been argued.

22

25

A

Well, yes.

We are actually saying that the

Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals of the State of New
York cannot read all this new language into a statute it has
once interpreted 40 years ago in order to make a prosecution
hold against a number of black people who have

politically

unpopular ideas.
I want to bring to the Court's attention to what
the District Attorney said it was necessary to charge the
defendants here with the crime of anarchy along with the other
42 counts of gun possession because the District Attorney had
to show the element of intent and what did he say in the various
press releases which are part of the papers in this case?
This is what the District Attorney in this prosecution
22

1

2

thinks the defendants were doing.

O

capitalist system in the United States by violence, if necessary

I submit that this statute here is being used in a

11

way similar to what a commentator once said about using self­

12

incrimination evidence, that it is a part of laziness.

13

far easier to sit in the shade and rub red peper in some poor

14

devil’s eyes than to go out in the sun collecting evidence.

15
16
17

It is

\

Q

Could you take a minute to say what these

people were charged with specifically?
A

Well, my client was charged with,the first count

18

was disseminating — was talking about the overthrow of the

19

government of the State of New York by force and violence.

20
21
22

23
24
25

The second count with writing pamphlets dedicated
towards the same thing, with the use of guns.
The third count was assembling for that purpose and
then the fourth count is conspiracy to do that with a number
of overt acts, nine out of 14, I believe, having to do with,
again, the dissemination of leaflets, pamphlets, meetings,
23

1

2

speech.
So that insofar as the anarchy aspect of the case,

3

it has to do with the dissemination of ideas which are unpopular

4

I do not think that this Court can shut its eyes to the fact

5

that the anarchy statute has not been used in New York for

6

anything other, in the '60*s, and not before that since the

7

8 20's, than to' try to proscribe the conduct of black people

8

in expressing ideas which are unpopular.

9

We are faced with a situation where the Court is

10

acting like a super-legislature going along with the District

11

Attorney so that it is more than a punishment fitting the crime/

but the Court's in a sort of after-arranged approval of the
conduct of the prosecution approving a crime to fit the so-called
bad conduct.
Now, there has been a great deal of discussion in
this Court about hard-core conduct as distinguished from other
kind of conduct under the free-speech cases.

Judge Friendly,

in the Court below, said that these defendants don’t have a
prayer in his Court because their conduct was hard-core conduct..
•

....

I don't think you can talk about hard-core conduct
where you have a challenge to a statute that is vague and this
Court held 160 and 161 as fatally vague in the Keyishian case.
You might have hard-core conduct in a situation where the
statute is overbroad, where you say that certain things are
enumerated which are bad and other things are mentioned which

24

?

are too vague or too broad and should not be upheld.
Here there is nothing that these defendants did

So that when you read it, it

sounds as though this Court, was squarely saying that the
language as a whole is too vague.
Therefore, I think that the whole concept of hard-core
cannot be fought because hard-core has to refer to a situation
where a statute is partly Constitutionalt

some kind of conduct that the legislature would have a right
to proscribe.

fact — that, for a moment, your client as well as some of the

22

others here had been indicted, among other things, for the

23

unlawful possession of weapons and their defense is that they

24

possessed themselves of weapons in order to protect their

25

First Amendment right.

Do you think — and let's suppose that
26

3

you wanted to test whether that statute is unconstitutional,

2

maybe too broad or what-not — would declaratory judgment or

3

injunctive remedy be available to you?

I think, that raises another problem which was

not raised here and that is perhaps a hearing to determine what

of the State statute and that they did so because they thought
that that was necessary in order to protect their First
Amendment rights.
Do you believe that the District Court would be
proceeding properly to entertain an action for declaratory
judgment or an injunction, assuming that these people had been
indicted under that statute?
A

Well, without answering your question, I would

say that it differs from the one here because there we are
assuming that there is a valid State statute and that this
prosecution — that the defense of the defendant is that it
was a First Amendment defense.
Q

Well, assume that it is an invalid State statute,

assume that it is too broad, or what-not, assume that.
A

Well, if it is too broad, as this anarchy

be a very appropriate basis for —27

I don't want to be the author of that position.

It seems to me that when they narrow the issue down quite a

ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANTS-APPELLEES

MR. LUDWlGs

O

a

4

Mr» Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
This indictment is aimed, not at the discussion or

5

dissemination of ideas on anarchy, Communism, or what-have-you,

7

but on the accumulation of an arsenal of weapons and ammunition,

8

and gasoline, and black powder to overthrow or paralyze, over­

What is the evidence in this case on this unusual

11

review in the high Court?

The real evidence in this case

13

consists of 6,524 rounds of ammunition, plus 32 boxes of

14

ammunition, plus six cans of ammunition, enough ammunition,

15

with a good marksman, to kill 9,000 people.

16

This ammunition was seized pursuant to an arrest

17

warrant, plus a search warrant after the indictment of the

18

appellants in this case.
In addition, we have 43 guns similarly seized

them or holding meetings to discuss that and so on; is that

to understand because they have not read the weapons law.

of the three-judge panel came down in June of 1968 and then

17

Q

May I ask you whether the Federal Court proceed­

delayed in any event?

20

A

The delay from June 20, 1967 to March 12, 1968

21

has no connection with the Federal Courts.

22

until today, April 1, 1969, it is purely Federal delay.

11

in this case is the intent to overthrow local government, not

12

to rob anybody, not to assault anybody, not to do what 999 out

Your Honor, you are quite right in delineating

Obviously the remote end is the overthrow and the proximate
end of their conduct is to kill policemen in general, officials

the privileges and immunities clause.
In this case Kerman Presser, who was the president of
the Lier and Wier Variety, a German organization in Chicago,
organized an armed group of uniformed persons and he rode on
horseback carrying a sabre on his shoulder and the other
fellows had rifles.

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK J. LUDWIG, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANTS-APPELLEES

7

MR. LUDWIG:

Mr. Justice Fortas made several inquiries

8

about the power of a Federal tribunal to enjoin to grant a

9

stay, grant an injunction staying State proceeding.

I take

to

the same position the Court did in the Peacock case in 1966

11

where it was said in the majority opinion that Congress could

12

forbid Federal Courts from intervening prior to a final determine

13

tion of the State tribunal in criminal proceedings or they

14

could say all questions, all Federal questions in a State

15

criminal proceeding should be transferred to a Federal tribunal

16

for decision and keep the State judges out of the picture.

17

In this case, Congress, back in 1793, passed this

18

anti-injunction act with three exceptions.

19

way from 1793 up until 1875 when one exception was made by

20

Congress in connection with bankruptcy proceedings and as far

21

as Congress was concerned it remained unchanged until 1948

22

when they put the three exceptions now in the present law.

23

The exception we are concerned

It remained that

with is the one about

24

"As expressly authorized by Act of Congress".

25

to my knowledge, and I used to be a law clerk in a Federal Court
50

Congress, nowhere

1

has ever expressly authorized any exception by reference to

2

2283 by number.

3

exceptions.

4

It has however, in many instances, made

It has done so in three or four

different v/ays.

One formula is to say that the Federal Court can

5

restrain State

proceedings, like the Habeas Corpus Act, Title

6

28, Section 2251 or the Interpleader Act, the same title, Section

7

2361, or the Disbursed Party exception inthe same title, 2344-A.

8

Another formula is where the Congress has

said any

9

proceedings may be restrained, like the Bankruptcy Act? others

10

or all claims and proceedings shall cease like limitation of

11

liability act, Title 46, Section 185 and, finally, in the

12

removal statute, the State Court shall proceed no further.

13

However, the 1983, claimed as an exception to 2283,

14

merely says that you can maintain a suit in law or in equity.

15

It doesn't talk about the restraint

17

of any proceedings.

I think that we ought to let State Court judges, as
expressed in Peacock, get acquainted

with Federal issues and

be governed by the decisions and opinions of this Court.
If we were to take away from them all determinations
of First Amendment right issues they would soon atrophy so
far as the Supreme law of this land is concerned.

MRS. MARCUS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
The purported basis for the Federal intervention in

6

this case is that there will be a chilling effect on First

7

Amendment rights by virtue of the existence of this advocacy

8

of anarchy law.

9

such chilling effect can occur.

10

I think analysis will demonstrate that no

The Epton decision very clearly, on the basis of

11

this Court’s decision in Dennis, placed pure advocacy outside

12

the ambit of the statute, placed advocacy of mere doctrine

13

outside the ambit of the statute.

14

Now, this interpretation governs any prosecution,

15

not only this prosecution, but any prosecution brought before

16

as to conduct engaged in before the new penal code amendments„

17

Of course, it also governs prosecutions based on the new penal

18

code amendments.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

So, the group we have left is a group which may have
been deterred by the statute prior to the Epton decision, who
cannot be prosecuted because Epton places pure ad/zocacy outside
the ambit of the statute.

We cannot even identify this group.

We don't know who they are and they cannot be prosecuted.
Therefore, the hypothetical rights of this hypotheti­
cal group, under this Court’s decision in Goldman versus

52

Zwickler does not present any real case or controversy.

consider the grant of such relief inappropriate under the

special circumstances here presented, that such relief, meaning

declaratory or injunctive relief, so that he did, in that way,

asks for — a declaratory judgment on activities outside the

say that they wish to continue and no one is attempting to

their right to speak on subjects on great national

importance, to engage in abstract advocacy of doctrine.

Your Honor.

I think the context, as you pointed out in the

Dennis decision, is crucial and it is not a question which can
be determined outside of the particular contest because of the
context which is going to supply the clear and present danger.
This, in fact, illustrates oneof the reasons for the
importance of

a record in a

State Court because it is this

record, in addition to the indictment, which is going to show
whether there xvas such a clear and present danger and whether

I think thatin view of the fact that several months

14

the gloss that was missing, that this answers some of the doubts

15

that this Court had about the meaning of these provisions, the

of the decision in Epton.

It was brought up this morning to what extent the
possibility of success of an attempt on the government, the
size of the group, what relations these factors have to the
ultimate decision here.

I think this Court made clear in the

Yates case that — and in Dennis also — the actual overthrow
need not be demonstrated.
This Court, in Dennis, said,

"The

damage which

such attempts create, both physically and politically to a natic n,

make it impossible to measure the validity in terms of

probability of success."

These words are particularly meaningful in the light

4

ofthe indictment here. In a city, such as New York, the cutting

15

I think there has been a great emphasis by Mrs. Piel

16

this morning that the acts of appellants are purely speech and

17

that they were only discussion and that, therefore, the State's

13

criminal law should not be applied to these activities.

19

Mr. Ludwig has shown that the acts went far beyond pure speech.

20

I think

However, even if they were unmixed with the kind of

21

conduct which we have here, I think that this Court has indicate a

22

in a. number of cases that the touchstone is the danger the

speech creates, not merely the fact that it is speech which is

an aspect of the conduct being considered.
