ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C, LARRIMER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

10

MR. LARRIMER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

tlie Court.
The issue in this case is essentially whether or not

11

an employer can make a scholarship grant to an employee with

12

that scholarship grant being excludable from gross income

13

under the Internal Revenue Code.

14

The Government9s position is that it cannot because

15

Congress expressly stated that any continuing salary arrange­

1G

ment was not to have attached to it tax exempt consequences.

17

This statement on behalf of the Government is re­

18

peated throughout its briefs as though the constant repetition

19

would add some validity to it.

20

The legislative history, however, does not support

21

the statement that a scholarship which may in fact be labelled

22

a continuing salary arrangement.

23

not support that statement.

24
25

The legislative history does

The 1954 Code in which Section 117 was inserted with
respect to scholarships and fellowships was new with the 1954
25

I

Code.

There was no specific provision of the Internal Revenue

2

Code previous to that time.

3

Q

May I ask you a question?

4

The Fifth Circuit went the other way in this case,,

5

did it not?

6

A

Yes* sir.

7

Q

Are there any other circuits that have gone that

a

route, too?

9

A

12

Fourth Circuit* if I am not mistaken.

15

17
18

24
25

There are at least two

Circuit in this case.
The Congress at the time of enacting Section 117
recognized the state of confusion which existed as to the tax
consequences of the scholarship and fellowship giant.

It set

about, to attempt to provide what it labelled a clearcut method
of determining the tax consequences of these grants without the
necessity of deciding each cases case by case.
It did so under the format of Section 117 in which

19

20

I think it is the

circuits which are in conflict with the decision of the Third

13
14

There is another circuit.

it set forth specifically that a scholarship at an educational
institution shall not be included in gross income.

It also

provided that a fellowship shall not be included in gross
income.
Then* considering the compensatory possibilities of
these grants. it inserted limitations in the Code in Section 117
26

1

First it provided with respect to scholarships and

2

it is recognized by Congress at this point that scholarships

3

must be at an educational institution as it is defined in the

4

Internal Revenue Code»
Th© Internal Revenue Code specifically defines an

5

6

educational institution as an institution which has a regular

7

faculty and a regular student body and a regular curriculum»

8

So Congress intended that a scholarship would relate only to

Q

What is his contract for the future?

A

He has no contract except that when he goes on

this educational leave he agrees that he will come back to the
employer for a period of at least two years.
Q

Is that a binding contract?
27

He

A

1

3

It is binding,

I think so»

Yes, Mr. Justice.

I think it is binding but I don't think it is enforceable to
the extent of requiring him to come back.

4

Q

A suit could be filed for the breach?

5

A

Yes.

6

Q

What is the salary he had agreed to be paid when

7

he gets back?
A

8
9

At the commensurate salary of other persons with

his qualifications.

10

Q

What about in comparison with when he left?

11

A

The record in this case establishes that they

12

receive the same salary when they return as they were receiving

13

at the time they left.

14

Q

For how long?

A

Pardon?

For how long?

Well, they are classified.

25

How long do they hold that same

salary?
They have various

classifications of engineers, they have an associate engineer
and a junior engineer and so forth.

These are classifications

that prevail throughout the company.
When they reach — when they are elevated into another
classification, this is dependent on merit.
that classification, then their salary

When they reach

is adjusted accordingly.

And the company gets him for the same salary

after he had the two years8 training in college?

2
3

A

They get him for the same salary that he was

receiving at the time he left,

Q

How long do they hold on that do you say?

5

A

The agreement is for two years.

But that doesn't

peg his salary,-

7

the salary will be commensurate with the duties assigned to him.

3

In other words, if he is assigned as a junior engineer

9
10

His salary is pegged -— the contract provides

he will be paid as a junior engineer.

If he is assigned as an

associate engineer, he will be paid at that rate,

Yes, sir.

10

Q

And that would entitle him to whatever pay was

11

-

didn't he?

being made for people in his grade at the time he comes back?

12

A

That is right.

13

Q

May I ask you, how did the company treat this

14

expenditure feax-wise?

15

A

Mr, Chief Justice, the evidence in the case

16

established that this amount of money, this living allowance or

17

stipend as we call it, was classified on their accounting

18

records as indirect labor.

10
20
21
22
23
24
23

Q

As indirect labor?

A

As indirect labor.

Q

Yes.

A

And the company withheld income tax or with­

holding tax from this stipend, but did not withhold the income
tax from the tuition that was paid under the same program.
Q

How does that break down in dollars?
30

A

1

2

Well, the tuition is rather nominal compared

to the living allowance paid.

3

Q

Most of it they counted as business expense?

4

A

Yes, sir.

5

Q

And they counted his service during the interim

6

as indirect labor so they could do that?

7

A

That is right.

8

Q

If they hadn't called it indirect labor, could

9

they have done that?

14
15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

that?

Could they have taken a deduction for

Couldn’t it be considered operating expenses?
A

My opinion is that a company can have a scholar-”

ship program or fellowship program and deduct the cost of it
as an ordinary and necessary business expense.
Q

They call it indirect labor then?

A

There is no clear answer to that except to the

extent that they had no account which they labeled fellowships
and scholarships.
Q

Why shouldn’t they if that was an exempt

expenditure?
A

I don’t know why they did not have, except

perhaps it may have been because of the contractual relationship
between Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Atomic Energy
Commission, because these men were employed at Bettis Atomic
Power Laboratory which was a Government-owned but contractoroperated plant, which means that the Government owned it and
31

1

paid for all the expense of operation, but it was operated by

a

Westinghouse.

3

required, this to be labelled as indirect labor.

And perhaps it was an accounting method which

4

Q

Westinghouse was on a cost-plus basis?

5

A

Essentially, yes.

6

Q

And then they took a deduction for this?

7

A

This would be charged to the AtomicEEnergy

8

Commission.

9

Q

10

So they actually got from the Government 10 per­

cent more than they put out for this?

11

A

Well, I don't know that, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

Q

Why wouldn't they have, if it is an operating

13

14

expense and they are entitled to cost-plus, why couldn't they
get it?
A

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Well, assuming that premise is correct, that

they get 10 pecent of whatever they spend, then that would be
true, yes.

I am not sure that that is true in this case.
Q

It might not be the exact percentage.

That is

what you mean?
A

Right.

I
Now, Congress established the tax exempt status for
a scholarship in an educational institution and a fellowship.
It then inserted limitations considering the compensatory
aspect of these two grants.

aspect to the grant.

8

9

determined by whether or not it was gift or compensation.

10

In other words, previous to 1954, the

How could they do that?

A

only one case that held that a fellowship was a gift.

There was
But it

is difficult, and in my way of thinking you cannot eliminate
tine compensatory aspect of a scholarship or fellowship because
the very nature of the grant requires you to render services,
to go to school.
The fact that those services are not of benefit to
the grantor does not eliminate a compensatory aspect.
Q

Suppose one of those scholars had decided not

to go back to the company.
A

Could he be sued?

He can be sued, Mr. Justice, but I doubt if

there are any damages.
33

Q

He was a capable man

and he was' worth more than before,, by reason of his training.

do that at the end of two year’s training?
A

10
11

13

15

21

22

Isn’t that one of the big considerations on that?

A

The basic consideration is the allowance of the

employ.

18

If they could establish damages, yesf he would

be liable on damages for not returning.

12

14

They have other employees

Q

And work for them for that salary?

A

For a salary commensurate with the other

employees.
But our position is that Congress specifically pro­
vided in the Code the compensatory aspect of a scholarship.
Once it is determined that a grant is made for the education
of an individual, if it is a scholarship at an educational
institution there is only one circumstance in which a part of

23
24
25

it is taxable and that is specifically provided under Section
117 in the limitation, and that provision is that if he is

34

1

required to render services, in the nature of part-time employ­

2

ment, then the value of those services is taxable, and it is

3

only the balance of the scholarship which is tax free.
And there is a further exception on that is if those

4

5

services which are required to be rendered are services which

6

are required as part of the curriculum

7

degree then even they do not result in taxable income.

this is a classic --

I take it the other way around.

I suppose that most of these people are working in areas where

14

they have a wide choice as to the subject of their thesis.

Your clients were all t*;orking on thesis, weren't they?

!6

A

Yes.

17

Q

Well, they have a wide choice as to that and it

is permitted and approved by the university just as it was in

your case.

Q

Is a doctor's dissertation part of a curriculum?

A

Yes.

The fellow looks over the whole spectrum of

to him.

Is that part of the curriculum?
A

defense of it is part of the curriculum,

It is required for

Welly if that is what you are talking about, if

6

you are using curriculum in that, sense that the topic of the

7

dissertation is approved, of course, it has to be approved

8

by the university authorities.

9

A

Does that make any difference?

It has to be approved and it has to be required.

10

That type of an investigation has to be required for the grant

11

of a degree.

12

then it is services rendered and it would not qualify as

13

scholarship at an educational institution,

If it is not required for the grant, of a degree
a

Wall, obviously some relationship between that

15

and this situation in which, ae I understand it, the disserta­

16

tion has to be in some measure to some degree related to the

17

work of the laboratory, in any event if there is a dispute

18

between you and the Government as to what, the record shows on

19

that, in any event the dissertation subject has to foe approved

20

by Westinghouse or the AEC or both of them.

21

And so that there is some measure of service,

I

22

should arguably there is some measure of service being rendered

23

by the scholarship recipient between Westinghouse and AEC?

24
25

A

The best response I can make to this, your Honor,

is when in fact occurred in this case, and one of the students
37

*

1

selected a thesis topic which he had investigated during his

2

leave of absence.

3

which would, have been of value to engineering generally.

4

after studying it and investigating this for his entire leave

5

period he gave it up because he didn't have enough time and

S

he didn't have enough equipment to really arrive at an answer

7

which would satisfy the requirements of the university for the

8

thesis.

11
12

house was not interested in this particular thesis to the
extent that they would take it upon themselves to pick it up
where this man had left it off and get the answer to it.
So that the nature of the thesis topic had to be in

13
14
15

engineering, which is about the limit of the value of the
specific topic to Westinghouse itself.

The evidence was then put in the record that Westing-

May I ask you this?

This is what is bothering

If this is justified as a business expense, on the basis

that it is part-time employment, why shouldn't there be some
pro- tanto recognition of the part that is employment and the
part that is not employment when the tax returns are made?
A

The answer must be, Mr. Chief Justice, that

Congress felt that if a student on a scholarship at an educa­
tional institution was pursuing the curriculum required by that
university, then no part of it should be treated as compensation
and taxable.

23
38

1

Q

Well? might it not be one thing if the compsiny

2

just out of the goodness of his heart gave this stipend to a

3

man for this particular period and did not consider it as

4

business expense in its operation?

5

it

6

time employment?

7

On the other handy treating

as a business expense and justifying it because it was part-

A

I don!t think there has to be a correlatione

8

don’t think because it is deductable by the company it must

9

be taxable to the recipiente

10

Q

I

There are other ——

Don't you think one of them should at least pay

11

something by reason of it being part-time employment?

12

think if it is part-time employment that the company should

13

teike all of it as a tax deduction, or if the employee is being

14

paid partially for work he does for the company that he

15

shouldn’t pay some income?

16

A

Do you

I think that if it is in fact part time employ-

17

menfe that — and it is outside the curriculum requirements,

18

then he should pay tax»

19

20

Q

Well, would you say then that they were wrong

in calling it part-time employment?

21

A

Westinghouse was wrong?

22

Q

Yes.

23

A

I think they did it out of an abundance of

24
25

caution because of the fact that there are other sections of the
Code which say that if an employer does not withhold tax — may
39

1

I answer your question — there is another section of the Code

2

which provides that if an employer does not withhold tax from

3

something which is taxable, then the employee who receives it

4

does not pay tax on it, then both the employee and the employer

5

are responsible for the same tax.

8

So out of an abundance of caution, the employer

7

without fail, usually withholds tax unless the employee liti­

8

gate the tax consequences of if.

No, I think Westinghouse was just attempting

to protect itself.

In that respect»

In that respect, so it could

consider it as a business expense?
A

Well, I don’t — I am not sure why Westinghouse

did it other than for the protective feature of if.
Q

Is there any limitation of the amount in your

submission that could be exempt from tax as a scholarship under
— if a person is working toward a degree?
A

There is no limitation under amount so long as

the amount is initially determined to be a scholarship.

An

amount to enable the student to pursue his education at an
institution.

There is only a limitation on amounts to a

fellowship„
Q

As to a fellowship, somebody not working toward

have designed to obtain people like the respondents for six
or seven years, and in the fifth year they get this leave and
this obligates them to return as in the case of one respondent,
in the sixth year.

In the case of the other two, for the sixth

and seventh years.
