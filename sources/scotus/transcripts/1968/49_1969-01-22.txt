MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Case No. 49, Zenith Radio

Corporation, petitioner, versus Hazeltine Research, Inc., et al.

4

Mr. McConnell.

ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. McCONNELL, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. McCONNELL:

7

11

Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the

Court:
I represent the Zenith Radio Corporation, which is the
petitioner in this case.
Respondents are the Hazeltine Research, Inc., a cor­

12

poration, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hazeltine

13

Corporation, and it was stipulated by the parties in this case

14

in the pretrial stipulation that for all purposes in this law­

15

suit, and all purposes in the instant case, that the two cor­

16

porations should be considered one and the same.

17

The instant suit was brought for the alleged infringe­

18

ment of a patent, a monochrome patent, alleged to have been

19

infringed by the Zenith Corporation and both the District Court

20

and the Court below, the Court of Appeals, held that that patent

2?

was invalid and not infringed.

22

Q

Mr. McConnell, I am sorry, but there is an issue

23

that is submitted to us, isn’t there, as to whether both Hazel­

24

tine corporations are bound here or whether it is just the sub­

25

sidiary and not the parent?
3

1

A

That is right.

2

Q

Is there a difference there?

3

A

I am going to reach that in the course of my

Q

I didn't understand why you made your openinq

4
5
6
7

argument.

statement, because there is that issue.
A

There is that issue, Your Honor.

I simply made

8

the statement as part of the facts in the case, that there was

9

that pretrial stipulation and I am treating for this portion of

10

11

the argument the two corporations as the same.
In that suit, Zenith answered by setting out that that

12

patent and other patents of Hazeltine had been misused by put­

13

ting them in foreign patent pools, which foreign patent pools

14

had refused to license imports and had restricted commerce be­

15

tween the United States and foreign countries, namely, Canada,

16

England, and Australia, contrary to the provisions of the anti­

17

trust laws, the Federal antitrust laws, that any restriction or

18

any combination, conspiracy or arrangement between competitors

19

which restrain commerce not only between the States of the Unite i

20

States, but between the country of the United States and foreign

21

countries violated section 4 of the Clayton Act, sections 1 and

22

2 of the Sherman Act, and under those two sections, also section

23

16 of the Clayton Act.

24
25

Alleging the same facts as we had set up in the misuse
answer, we filed a counterclaim and in that counterclaim asked
4

1

for treble damages and asked fox* an injunction against the

2

activities of these foreign patent pools.

3

After a trial and findings of fact in detail made by

4

the District Court, a judgment was entered on April 5, 1965 pur­

S

suant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

6

The damages which had been occasioned by the plaintiff, or by

7

the counterclaimant in the amount of $19,042,173 for the loss of

8

sales and profits in the Canadian market in the sale of home re­

9

ceiving sets in television and radio.

10

At the time the findings came down, Baseltine obtained

11

new counsel and came in and made various motions which are dis­

12

cussed in the briefs, the purport of which was to reopen the

13

case on evidence which was available at the time of the trial

14

and for further proceedings on the claim that there were em­

15

bargoes imposed by the Government as opposed to private patent

16

pools and conspiracies in England and Australia.

17

For that limited purpose, the case was reopened, and

18

after further hearing, on December 13, 1965 the trial court

19

awarded petitioner treble damages in the amount of $15,919,458

20

for loss of sales and profits in England and Australia during

21

the damage period.

22

In the first judgment, an injunction was entered

23

against the continuance by the respondent companies and the

24

pools for putting their patents in these pools or in any way

25

furthering the activities of these pools — and this is importan

5

no supersedeas was filed to that judgment, even though there
was an appeal, and since that first judgment was entered on
April 5, 1965, Zenith has been operating under the protection
of the injunction of the United States District Court in their
activities in Canada.
On appeal, or in entering the last judgment after
the trial court had heard all the evidence that was produced
on the original trial, plus all the different matters which were
urged and argued in a three- or four-day hearing on the motions
to reopen the case, and after hearing everything that was sub­
mitted in the case, trial court made this comment, and I quote:
"There could be no question in my mind that Zenith
suffered damages during the damage period by virtue of
the pools which I have found, and reiterate, existed at
the time of the damage period."
The Court of Appeals reversed both judgments on the
ground that there is no substantial evidence in this record
that Zenith was injured by the activities of these pools in its
business or property, and held, as a matter of law, that on thi5
record Zenith was not even threatened with injury by the
activities of these pools.
Now, the proof of injury to Zenith’s business in
Canada was in large part documentary and I am going to go into
it in some detail in the course of this argument, and was not
denied by any single witness or document in this case.
6

1

So it is my submission to this Court that what is

2

presented is whether, on admitted facts, which we claim and

3

the District Court found was unequivocal in its proof of actual,

4

substantial damage to the Zenith Corporation, whether on those

5

admitted facts, as a matter of law, the Federal antitrust laws,

6

namely, 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and 4 and 16 of the Clayton

7

Act, do not reach and have no sanction which will stop that con­

8

duct.

9

Now, before going to the individual markets, I want

10

to, if the Court will bear with me, take just a few minutes to

11

give some of the background of this conspiracy.

12

In this Court in 1962, and in subsequent cases, has

13

held, namely, in the Continental Ore case, that conspiracies

14

which are designed to control a complete market and which are

15

put together by competitors to exclude competition permanently,

16

should not be juged by taking particular parts of the proofs

17

and examining them and passing on to something else, but that

18

the proofs should be looked at as a whole, and in the Continents I

19

Ore case that it was highly relevant to go back and look at the

20

proofs at the inception of the conspiracy and the proofs out

21

22
23

24
25

of which the conspiracy was created to show its intent, its
purpose, its effect, and its result.
Now, I have been in this litigation with these pools
on behalf of Zenith since 1953 and I am not going to refer to
any of my own personal knowledge.
7

Everything I am going to

1

tell this Court with reference to the beginnings is in this

2

record.

3

evidence in this case came in by pretrial stipulation without

4

any objection, the documents as to their verity all admitted,

5

no objection to them whatever, no contravening evidence of any

6

kind, and some of it, and most of it, and the part I am now

7

going to talk about, put in by my opponents in the trial court.

0

From 1919 until 1935, through some 50 cross-licensing

countries.

12

where competition is possible.

13

I am leaving out the Iron Curtain

I am talking now about the free world countries

Among those companies was the telephone company, the

14

Westinghouse Company, R.C.A., General Electric Company, English

15

Electric Company, the Telefunken Company, The General Electric

16

Company of Germany, GTSF, the French company, Standard Cables

17

and Wireless, the Austallian company, and the Phillips Company

21

24
25

of Holland, which i3 the largest electronics company and prob­
ably the largest aggregation of capital and business in the
entire world.
Now, all of these companies, shoulder to shoulder and
by cross-licensing agreements divided the free world up into
markets and part of that was the North American Continent,
which was assigned to the so-called "radio group.”

The radio

group was composed of the telephone company — that's American
8

1

Telephone and Telegraph Company —■ General Electric, R.C.A.,

2

the Westinghouse Company, and the Phillips Company.

3

Zenith came into conflict and confrontation with this

4

worldwide conspiracy when in 1933 R.C.A., with 10,000 patents

5

in a pool which was composed of patents contributed by all the

6

companies that I have mentioned, some 10,000 of them, asserted

7

them against Zenith and demanded that we take a license.

8
9

We took the position, and said

30

in our pleadings

which are in this case, that the whole industry in the United

10

States had paid tribute to this pool for years, $1,300,000 or sc

11

had been paid in tribute to the pool, that the pools were

12

illegal, and we filed a suit in the United States District Court

13

down in Delaware asking for a determination that the pools were

14

illegal, a case before Judge Lahey, now dead.

15

Immediately the pool countered with 63 patent suits

16

against us in that proceeding.

17

in one of them, it took us 18 months to try it.

18

them all, there wouldn't be a lawyer left alive who had ever

19

had any connection with the case.

20
21

25

Parenthetically, we got to trial
If we tried

They countered out of that suit by suing Zenith in
the United States District Court in Chicago on two patents,
the telephone company, R.C.A. and General Electric, and in that
suit, Zenith counterclaimed and set up a suit for treble damages
claiming that they had been excluded from the market in Canada
and couldn't sell their goods there because of the pool which
9

?

was part of the overall conspiracy, the pool known as Canadian

2

Radio Patents, Limited.

3

That suit got down to trial.

It was to go to trial

4

on September 9, 1957,

5

parties settled the case by paying Zenith $10 million, giving

6

Zenith patent rights in then existing black and white monochrome

7

patents in all markets, and the suit down in Delaware was dis-

8

missed upon their, in effect, dedicating the patents, 10,000 of

9

them, to the trade.

to

The Sunday before it went to trial the

I brought that in for a purpose, because Zenith is

It

represented here as in some way taking advantage of the anti­

12

trust law3, when I submit on the entire record they have done

13

very constructive service under the antitrust laws, and they

14

freed the entire American market, so that from that time on —

15

and the relevance of this is on the damage proof --- we had a

16

free market in the United States.
With a free market, Zenith came from a little, small

17
18

company, hardly known, to the leading company in television,

19

and I think the second or third producer in the United States

20

in radio.

21

Q

Is there any issue as to the effect of the re­

22

lease that Zenith executed in this litigation that was settled

23

that has a bearing on the present problem, or are you agreed

24

that the release operated to benefit Hazeltine?

25

Let me put it to you this way:
10

Hazeltine was not a

1

party to the litigation that you have just described which was

2

settled, was it?

3

A

No.

4

Q

But various companies that were members of the

5

Canadian Radio Patent Pool were parties? is that right?
A

6

Well, maybe I haven“t been frank with Your Honor

7

entirely.

I believe that Hazeltine was named, if not in the

3

pleadings, certainly in the proofs, as a co-conspirator,
Q

9

All right.

But however it may be, as part of the

!0

settlement of that litigation, as I understand the papers before

II

us, Zenith executed a release, and that release, in substance,

12

exonerated or relieved the defendants with whom Zenith settled

13

of liability for any past acts or any further liability to

14

Zenith for past acts? is that right?
A

15
16
17

20

21
22
23
24
25

There is no such evidence in this record.

There is no release in this record.

There are some settlement

papers in this record, put in by my opponents — not by me.
Q

13
19

No.

One important issue here, if it is an issue, is

whether you do or do not, whether there is or is not

agreement

that that settlement operated to benefit Hazeltine as a joint
tortfeasor, or whether it did not-.

Are you agreed on that, or

is that &n issue in dispute before this Court?

That is my

question.
A

There is an issue in dispute on that.

First, as

to the facts, I don9t agree any release ever released Hazeltine,
11

1

I definitely do not.

2

Secondly, no release was ever pleaded in this case

3

and no release was ever mentioned in this case until one year

4

after the case had been tried, at which time they came in with

5

an offer of proof of a release.

6

Now, we cite cases in our brief that under Rules 8,

7

I believe, and 15, affirmative defenese have to be pleaded in a

8

case so the party opposed can meet them, and no such plea was

9

made.

to

The case wasn't tried on any release theory.
Q

You have done a very elaborate job here, and I

11

don't want to interfere with you.

12

but all I want to know is whether we do or do not have to worry

13

about the effect of the release.

14

gather that we do.

This is an elaborate case,

From what you tell me, I

15

A

You do.

16

Q

Your adversary says that that release does re­

17
18

lease Hazeltine, and you say that it does not.
A

Exactly.

And I say further than that, not only

19

does it not release Haseltine, but it isn’t even an issue in

20

the case, except brought in later by offers of proof.

21

Under the rules, Your Honor, under the Federal rules,

£2

unless an affirmative defense is pleaded during the trial, so

23

you can meet it.

24
25

Q

During the trial, or during the time?

A

During the trial, or so close to it that the
12

!

1

parties are there trying their lawsuit.

2

Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit has handed down three

3

cases that say that even a court can't relieve them of a waiver.

4

There is nothing that can be done.

5

It is waived, and the

They have waived it.

The reason for it is that we try a lawsuit on the

6

pleadings and they go in there — they put this settlement in to

7

show that the two cases were different.

8

They told the court, "Why, it's a different case."

9

funniest plea of release I ever heard.

10

That is what they said.
That is the

There was never any plea of release and there was
never any evidence offered on it and no court ever opened it up,

12

3
14

5
6
7

either in the District Court or the court below to permit such
a defense to be made.
I say the issue is not before this Court.
Q

Are you saying this on the basis that the Court

might disagree with you?
A

Oh, if this Court disagrees with me, what I say

8

has absolutely no bearing on the subject.

9

tion about that.

There is no ques­

This is the last resort.

20

Q

I thought the rules were exceedingly liberal.

21

A

Not in this respect, and for a reason.

I mean,

22

you can't try cases on offers of proof after the case has been

23

submitted and you are in the upper courts with no chance to

24
25

show what the release was or where it was admitted or what the
objections to it are, and what it included, and all the factual
3

1

matters that were involved.
Q

2
3

after the case was appealed and in the Court of Appeals?
A

4

5

Are you saying now that this offer was only made

I am saying that this offer was made after

findings of fact had been made and the case had been tried.

6

Q

Was it still in the trial court?

7

A

Yes, it was still in the trial court, but the

3

release was available at the trial and not offered, a new theory
Q

3
10

on the release?
A

11
12

The Court of Appeals didn't place any reliance

No, the Court of Appeals said nothing about the

release.

13

So much for the background in this case.

14

say, however, that there is an anomaly from what I have said

15
16
17

I do want tG

already in that some of the leading lawyers in this country —
Whitney Seymour, who was later President of the Bar Association?
John Cahill, a leading lawyer in New York -- advised their clients

18

to pay $10 million for damages suffered by Zenith up until 1957

19

and this lower court now holds, as a matter of law, that sort

20

of conspiracy couldn’t cause any damage whatever.

21

Q

That isn't your main issue, is it?

22

A

No.

Q

As to the sufficiency of the evidence to support

23
24
25

the showing of damage?
A

Right.

That is all the court dealt with
14

1

apparently, and I assume tacitly, I believe, in order to reach

2

this point.

3

The Government has filed a brief here.

There really

4

isn't any question about the illegality of these pools under

5

the decisions of this Court.
I first want to address myself to the Canadian market.

6
7

Were we damaged?

Was there substantial evidence of damage in

8

the Canadian market?
In 1926 there wa3 put together up in Canada CRPL,

9
10

Canadian Radio Patents, Limited, and it was composed of our com­

11

petitors, people who sold radio and television sets in compe­

12

tition with us here and in Canada, if we ever got into the mar­

13

ket.

14

15

I have never seen a case, and I am sure this Court
hasn't either, where the evidence of the conspiracy is written

16

down, sponsored, and put in evidence by the respondents. Usually

17

the conspiracy case we have to try is a case where you infer

18

conspiracy from a number of different acts.

19

20

This Court held a long time ago, in the Interstate
Circuit case, that the old days of proving conspiracy by having j

21

people gathered around a table had gone to a darker age; that

22

now we prove conspiracies, particularly business conspiracies,

23

by showing a plan which is designed to destroy or interfere with

24

competition, and a joinder in it, with knowledge of its intent

25

and purport.

That is what you have to prove.

15

1

But we have nothing in the way of inference in that

2

sort of a proof.

3

issue, this Court has to see what this conspiracy was designed

4

to do, namely, to control a complete market,, pursuant to an

5

overall conspiracy to control the markets of the world.

6

But to understand the impact on the damage

Plaintiff's Exhibit 50-A, which>was put into evidence

7

by my opponents —- I didn’t put it in; they put it in — was a

8

report by the Royal Canadian Commission on a submission made by

9

Canadian Radio Patents, Limited where somebody up there, a dis-

j

10

tributor, had complained that they were keeping him from import- i

II

ing sets into Canada.
They heard all the evidence and they issued a report.

12

13

I want to read some of it, if the Court will bear with me.

14

is the whole conspiracy, as far as Canada is concerned.

15

Q

16

A

What was the report?

I
j

This

Who made it?

A Royal Canadian Commission, and it was issued

17

and dated December 31, 1959, within this damage period in this

case.

We had the issue made, Mr. Justice, in the District

Commission, thoroughly familiar with all of it, worked with

3

Q

Page 17 of your brief.

4

A

Yes, that is it.

5

The court held the proofs establish as a fact that in

6

the circumstances of this case, the Canadian Patent Act does not

7

require the pool to refuse to license importation, as contended

8

by plaintiff, nor does the Act penalize in any way a patentee

9

who licensed for importation; whereas, in this case there is

10

being carried on extensive manufacturing in Canada under its

11

patents.

12

It rules squarely on it.
Q

Where is that statement finding restricted to

13

the Canadian Patent Act?

Is there contention relating to any

14

other provision of Canadian law?

15

A

No.

Not another thing, Your Honor.

down these patent restrictions which restrain trade between

different countries.

Then they had a

So they changed it, and they said, under the congress
what was that congress?

It was a congress; congress of '24 —
28

1

well anyway, there was a congress; it is in the record — that

2

under that congress, no country who wanted to stay in the con­

3

gress could put any restrictions on patents or upon the import

4

of goods which were patented, and that was written into the

5

Canadian patent law, and the Canadian patent law says, "Nothing

6

in this Act shall be construed to contravert any treaty” — and

7

this was a treaty.

8

So it was clear out of the patent.

never in my life have I seen witnesses attempted to be impugned

by documents which are not in the evidence, which were never

even presented until a year after the case had been tried, where

12

no chance has ever been made to meet any of the documents which

13

they claim impeach Mr. Wright8s testimony.

14

In other words, ordinarily cases are tried on a record

15

made in the trial court, and here they come in with pages of

16

offers of proof, with new counsel, trying to take a new grasp

17

on the case a year after it has been tried.

for years and years, to the sounding of the gong of the Canadian

Radio Patents, the threat, the constant inherent threat against

7

everybody in the trade, with the warning notices, with the

3

investigations, with the lawsuits, and that was the market.

The pool was there, still in existence, run by General

Electric, even though the Government had started a suit against

them and had gotten a consent decree whereby three of the con­

12

spiring companies had agreed to license their sets without im­

portation -- which, by the way, negative any thought that, there

14

was anything in Canadian law that would prevent them from

to continue to run that pool, and General Electric continued to

run the pool with a permanent organization, manager, investi-

,

So Mr. Wright testified that he couldn’t get distribu­

20

tion, the kind of distribution to which a product of Zenith

21

was entitled in a market, and the reason he couldn't get it was

22

because of the threats of the pool against the potential dis-

23

tributors which he tried to get.

24

distribution in the Western provinces — there is a very sparse ■

25

He said he could get some

settlement out there ■— and some in the Maritime Province.
36

1

But along the contiguous territories he couldn’t get

2

them, so he had to use the hearing-aid distributor. We had a

3

hearing-aid distributor.

4

had a Canadian Zenith which distributed hearing aids and he used

5

them to try and build up some distribution,

So he couldn't get distributors, so he had to use

his hearing-aid distributors, and even under that impediment he I
was able to sell some sets, about 5 percent of the market, the
proof shows, against 20 percent which Zenith was selling in the
United States.

Twenty-three years ago I appeared before this Court

13

the Court of Appeals said that the only method of proving

damages is to compare an open market with a closed one.

It involved the Jackson

We had a jury verdict and it went up on

For a quarter of a century the motion picture industry

16

had destroyed an open market in Chicago.

There was no such com­

parison, and so, obviously, nobody could have made that kind of

18

proof, so the court held that there was no fact of damage and

19

reversed the case and it came up here by certiorari.

20

This Court, in that case, said that where wrongdoers,

21

violators of the Act, have destroyed an open market comparison,

22

estimates can be used, and in that case the only evidence we
had was the estimate of our theater manager that absent the re- !

strictions of the conspiracy we could have done as much business

as a competing theater, and the Court held —■

It rests on the testimony of Mr. Wright,

who at that time was Treasurer —

Canada, they would achieve the same percentage of market?

Yes, knowing all the factors —

What I am trying to suggest that you get to is

5

to tell us briefly, if you will, what their testimony says, if

6

anything, with respect to the basis for that conclusiary judg­

7

ment of theirs.

8
9

A

The basis of their testimony was that the markets

were essentially the same? that the advertising in the United

10

States overlapped into Canada and created a market for our pro­

It

duct; that the competition was comparable; that our sets were

12

better; that the shipping problems and tariffs were not involved

13

They took them all into consideration, and on the

14

basis of that -- and Kaplan, with 40 years in the business, and

t5

Wright with 20-some *— they testified from their knowledge that

16

they could have done it and could have gotten the same share

17

and there was no cross-examination and there was no other wit­

18

ness who testified any differently, and the testimony stands

19

uncontradicted on the record and the trial court adopted it.

20
21

22

Let me turn to Finding No. 36, which is found in the
back of the brief.

This is the finding;
t

"The foreign commerce of Zenith has been drastically

to it.

13

Nobody objected to the computation.

16
17

Q

20

23
24
25

If you don't mind, could you tell us briefly at

conclusion that the District Court was clearly erroneous in
finding the fact of damage?
The Court of Appeals held that you had not applied
adequately for licenses, that there was no showing that you were
excluded, in fact?
A

21

22

Nobody put on any

this point, on the basis stated by the Court of Appeals for its

18
19

Nobody objected

countervailing evidence.

14

15

It came in without objection.

What was it?

Well, I can't answer Your Honor's question be­

cause I have no comprehension of how the court could hold, on
this record, that there was no fact of damage, or even a threat
of damage.

I just don't understand it, to be perfectly candid

and frank with the Court.
47

1

Q

The Court of Appeals ordered some changes in the

2

injunction, but it didn’t reverse the judgment granting an in­

3

junction entirely, did it?

4

A

It did in part.

5

Q

But only in part.

0

A

But on the pools, it completely reversed it.

7

Q

On the pools it completely reversed it?

8

A

Yes.

9

Now, here we built up, under the protection of this

10

injunction, a business of $14 million, which approximates and

11

corroborates what the estimates were that were made by our

12

officials.

It gave us no protection at all.

The consequence — and I can't understate this — the

13
14

consequence of a sustaining of a taking away of our protection

15

from this injunction is that we can be sued on every single set

16

we have ever sold under the pool patents, and we are subject to

17

a potential liability of any profit that we made on those sets
f

18

and we can be forever barred from that market, and here sits

19

three companies waiting to see what this Court — we have taken

20

$10 million from them back in 1957 and they wait to see who is

21

going to get the business that Zenith has developed in Canada,

22

and if that isn't a threat — I mean, I should never have

23

started to practice law.
Q

24
25

I should have given it up altogether.

There is no other way to show what happened since; no other way.

The report to the stockholders

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
50

1

2

Before starting on the main part of my argument, I
would like to get a few basic points before the Court»
The first is that this case was tried before a Distric

3
4

Judge without a jury.
The second is that after the trial, Zenith prepared

5
6

and submitted findings for the judge to sign, and the judge

7

signed every single finding, and every single finding that he

8

did sign was a finding prepared by Zenith and he didn't even

9

change a comma.

The judge did not —-

10

Q

Is that something new or unique in this case?

11

A

In this case?

12

Well, it is unique insofar as the

courts in which I have been practicing are concerned.
The court reversed on the ground that the findings

13
14

were clearly erroneous that showed an impact on Zenith's busi­

15

ness .

16

Gypsum to the effect that a finding is clearly erroneous when,

17

although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court

18

on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm con­

ID

viction that a mistake has been committed, and the court said

20

that was the situation with the Court of Appeals in this case.

21

The court followed the rule announced by this Court in

Mow, Mr. McConnell said nothing about England, althoug

22

the amount of damages awarded by the court on the English pool

23

was approximately the same, in the neighborhood of $15 million. !

24

The reason I think that Mr. McConnell said nothing about England

25

was that the testimony in connection with the English pool

51

(

1

demonstrated, I think, to the Court of Appeals, that the state­

2

ments of Mr. Wright, President of Zenith, and of Mr. Kaplan,

3

Executive Vice President of Zenith, were not believable.

4

In connection with the analysis of the Court of Appeal

5

of the record with respect to England, that fact is demonstrated

6

These two men not only testified with respect to the English

7

pool? they testified with respect to impact, as Mr. McConnell

8

said, and with respect to the amount of damage they testified

9

on both subjects with respect to the Canadian pool as well.

10

Now, the Zenith evidence submitted by Mr. Wright,

?1

through Mr. Wright and Mr. Kaplan, is unbelievable on crucial

12

issues in this case.

13

the witnesses themselves, it was shown to be incorrect by later

14

evidence and undisputed findings, or it was directly contra­

15

dicted by contemporaneous documents which are in evidence.

16

It was either repudiated or recanted by

In connection with the English pool, we went in on a

17

motion to reopen the case as to the English pool upon getting

18

into the case and we made the motion on the ground that we

19

would be able to show that embargoes, English governmental

20

embargoes, prohibited and made impossible the importation of

21

radio and televison sets for 20 years before 1959 and there

22

wiare, as a result, two separate hearings as to England.

23

first was in 1964, after which the court entered Finding 36,

24

read by Mr. McConnell, exactly as submitted by Zenith, awarding

25

damages in the amount of $24 million.
52

The

1

Now, that finding and that award in England was based

2

upon testimony of these two men as follows:

I want to briefly

3

summarize it and then show what they said when they carae back

4

on the second trial, which was awarded to us limitedly on

5

embargoes as to England but which we were not permitted to have

6

as to Canada.

7

Q

When you say England, did you mean Canada?

8

A

No, sir.

10

three pools alleged.

I mean England.

You see there were

One was the pool in England.

One was the

pool in Canada and one was the pool in Australia.

11

Q

You are talking now about the-- -

12

A

I am talking now about the English pool about

13

which Hr. McConnell said nothing, although his judgment includes

14

about $15 million for England, and I am taking up England first

15

because I think that the testimony of these witnesses at the

16

first trial before findings were entered compared to the testi­

17

mony at the second trial as to England, after the court reopened

?8

on the question of these embargoes, shows that they were not

19

believable witnesses, that they were not credible witnesses,

Q

Did the Court of Appeals say anything about

their credibility?

it except that they did refer to one particularly outrageous

We went

in on a motion to set aside the findings on the ground that we
could show, as to England now, we could show that they were kept
out of the pool many years before 1959 by governmental embargo.

54

1

And it was the governmental embargoes that kept them out.

2

was not the act of the pools and their entire contention with

3

respect to England was that they had been kept out for many

4

years prior to 1959, that if they had been permitted to buy

5

the pools to sell during that period they would have built up

Q

If you took the position -—-

5

A

Well, I personally was not at the first trial.

Q

No.

7

A

And, I can’t say the reason for it.

I

1 assume,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, I assume the reason was because they did not

a

think that a case had been made up.

I am sure that was the
I

10
ii

reason.
May I say that first it was said that for many years,

12

as I said, Zenith had tried to import to England.

On each

13

occasion it was said the British pool threatened distributors

14

until they ceased buying Zenith products.

15

that Zenith, and that the English pool had prevented Zenith from

16

building up its market.

And it was claimed

i
j

;

<

]

17

They testified that during the four-year period, 1959

13

to 1963, Zenith had in fact attempted to market TV sets in

59

England converted from the American standard, the 525 line

20

standard in America, to a unique British 405 line system.

21

testified that Zenith had so converted its sets, had said sets

22

converted to its English distributor with kits and parts to make

23

conversions where necessary.

They

24

They testified further that conversion was so simple

25

Ramsay, the English distributor, did it in his back room, that
!

56

he had made such conversions, had made an effort to sell these
sets after the embargo was lifted in 1959, but was unable to do
so because he was precluded by the pool.
Now that was the testimony of these men at the first
hearing, precisely what I have said.
Now, they make two basic contentions, by their testi­
mony.

That these things had happened, that that is what had

hurt them, that that is how they were damaged.
Now, turning to the first point, that for many years
prior to "59 the pool had blocked Zenith's attempts to sell and
that they had been unable to build up the market.

Now the

Government's brief, the Solicitor General said, that this con­
tention of long exclusion of the pool with Zenith basic theory
of recovery, which indeed it was.
Now, after the Court's findings were entered as I say,
we filed this motion.

We urged that we could prove

that there

was nothing to this contention with respect to the blocking by
the pool in England before 1959, there was nothing to it.

We

could prove that Government embargoes is what did it and it was
not the pools at all.
Now, on that motion, and in the course of that argu­
ment , Zenith counsel denied that there were any embargoes, he
objected to reopening the case, on the ground that there were
no embargoes and he said, and I quote, from page 3035 to 3039
of the record.
57

j

1

2

"There never was an embargo, never." We can prove
just the opposite.

3

Zenith's counsel further stated to the trial court

4

and I am quoting.

5

court by counsel for Hazeltine, there never has been an embargo.

6

That is, there never has been a governmental prohibition aginst

7

importation of radios and television receivers either in England

8

or Australia."

"Contrary to representations made in open

Now that is what he argued to the court.

9

That is what

10

he said in opposing our motion to reopen.

But the court did

11

reopen, to enable us to put in proof of embargoes, limited to

12

that question and we did put in proof of the embargoes, and wa

13

did show that the embargoes existed and that was the reason we

14

were kept out of the English pool for 20 years, from 1939 to

15

1959.

16

that the Iron Curtain of the governmental embargoes and nothing

17

else kept Zenith out of England prior to June 1959, and out of

18

Australia prior to April 1960, which was the date of lifting the

19

embargoes in Australia.

i

That was proved beyond a doubt and the court then held

20

The trial judge held that.

21

Now the testimony of Zenith's witnesses of exclusions

22

by the pool part of '59 was thus shown to be untrue and the

23

Government agrees that that was what was Zenith's basic theory.

24

The Government agrees in their brief filed in this Court what

25

was Zenith's basic theory was shown to be without merit, on the
58

1

2

basis of the governmental embargoes»
It was right and Kaplan, these two men to whom

3

Mr. McConnell referred, it was right and Kaplan led the trial

4

court to believe that the pool had kept Zenith out of England

5

during those periods, and I would like to read from the record

6

this question on the second trial.

1

"Q

Now isn’t it a fact, Mr. Kaplan" — this is

8

cross-examination by Mr. Kayser — "that Zenith has taken the

0

position from the beginning of this litigation that for many

10

years it was excluded from the patent pools from importing radios

11

and television sets into all three countries?"

12

The Court, while it has not only taken that position

13

but they persuaded the Court to so find and Mr. Kaplan said,

14

"That is correct."

15

When Mr. Wright was recalled he said, "Now you told

16

this Court that

you had been excluded from England, Canada and

17

Australia for many years by the patent pools.

18

"A

Yes, sir.

19

”Q

You told this Court that based on that exclusion

20
21

22
23
24
25

you were entitled to damages during the statutory period?
"A

Yes, sir."
And the fact is that they were precluded and kept

out of England by the embargoes and nothing but the embargoes.
Now at the second hearing, faced with proof of the
embargoes they testified that they had known about the embargoes

59

I

1

all the time.

2

They said, "Why we knew about that all the time."
Zenith counsel, ift opposing our motion to reopen, what

3
4

did

he say?
He said, as I read to the Court, "There were no

5
6
7

Now they hadn't mentioned it, hadn't mentioned it

embargoes.

We can prove that there were no embargoes."
And what did Zenith officials say on recall?

They

3

said that the matter had been discussed with their attorneys

9

before they testified at the first trial.

They so testified

10

that they had taken the embargoes into consideration in their

11

first testimony.

12

barrier, although they said nothing about it and their counsel,

13

no doubt at their instructions, had denied it.

And it assumed that they ware a complete

14

Nov;, their second contention.

15

Q

If it was so wrong, what they said, why wasn't

16

that controverted at the first trial?

17

sit by and let that stand without saying anything against it

18

and leave the court to a wrong finding?

19

A

Why was it that you would

Well, I can't answer that, Mr. Chief Justice,

I

20

assume as I said a little while ago that the reason they didn't

21

put in evidence on that was that the case had not been made out

22

any way so they didn’t do it.

23

It is a fact that there was no proof of embargoes at

24

the first trial.

There was irrefutable proof at the

25

trial after the court, exercising his discretion, after the
60

second

I

court had reopened and let us put in evidence as to this ques­
tion and there was no question about it whatsoever.
Q

But the trial court said,

"yes, there is some

embargoes/' but after the embargoes were lifted, he still
thought that the pools kept Zenith out.

That still gave a

judgment with respect to England?
A

That is right.

He gave a judgment with respect

to England although there were those embargoes clear up to 1959
and his actual saying, "Well, now, there was written contempo­
raneous records, correspondence between Mr. Ramsay --Q

I was just thinking, what the trial court ulti­

mately did was to award a judgment for England?

argument a little while ago that, as I understand it, that there

12

Q

Was there or was there not an embargo in England

14

during the damage period, namely May 1959, May 1963?
A

There was no governmental embargo during that

15

period of time.

!6

interrupt, your Honor.

17

Q

Here is what there was.

I don't want to

No, that is the end of my question.

You have

18

been talking about embargo here and I want to know precisely

19

what the facts are as this record shows.

20

A

Well the precise facts are those that we have

21

just stated.

in April, 1960, in Australia.

Now then, after that, after that, I would like to

No.

facts are:

reason that Zenith didn't import to England during that period

was because they didn't want to.

18

I am familiar with that point and I understand

that point.

I just didn't understand your previous argument.

20

Q

21

22

What was the real purpose of your argument on

the embargo in light of what you have just told us?
A

Well, the purpose of it, your Honor, was that we

23

tried to reopen the case and did reopen the case for the purpose

24

of proving embargoes, though they were denied.

25

the reason we did that was that we wanted to show that their
63

We did that and

i

contention was incorrect, that the pool had been keeping them

u»

o

out as signing 36 said.

3

all these years.

4

The pool had been keeping them out

The pool didn’t keep them out.

It was the embargo
I

5

that kept them out from 1939 until 1959.

They had contended

6

that had the pool not kept them out all those years they would

1

have built up a market in England to a very high level which

8

would have yielded them profits during the damage period that

9

they were unable to earn.

j

10

That is the reason for it.

tt

Now? I want to say this.

This is a point specifically
I

12

mentioned by the Court of Appeals in the Court of Appeals*

13

opinion.
Their contention was that Zenith had intended to

14
15

import TV sets to England beginning in ’59 but were blocked by

16

the pool and as I say the uncontradicted documents were the

M

contrary but Zenith counsel characterised Kaplan's testimony

13

as being that he was able to convert to the English standard,

19

he was able to convert from the 525 line to the 409 line and

20

it was so simple that Ramsey could do it in his back room with

21

a screwdriver as Mr. McConnell characterized it, that they were i

22

converting these American-made sets to the English standard

23

throughout the damage period and that they were trying to sell

24

them but couldn't sell them because of the activities of the

.

!

25

pool.

64

1
2
O

sj

Now, on recall, they were forced to say contrary what
they had said at the first hearing.

No television sets had

been converted by Zenith to the English 405 line standard.

Mo

4

conversion kits had been furnished to Ramsay as they had said.

5

No sets had been adapted by the English distributor to the

6

English 405 line standard, and no sets had been offered by

7

Zenith in the English market at all.

8

Now, I think this testimony of Mr. Wright, when con-

9

fronted with this testimony he had given at the first trial

!0

compared to what he said at the second trial, is revealing.
i

It

"Q

When you told the court back in 1964 that Zenith

12

had sent a few television sets to Mr. Ramsay which he had

t3

attempted to market, you did not know whether or not those sets

14

were equipped to receive English television?

!

15

"A

No, sir, I did not.

16

"Q

When you told the court that Mr. Ramsay had

17

attempted to market these sets, did you know whether or not he

18

did in fact attempt to market them?

19

"A

I did not know specifically what he had done."

20

Now the Government agrees that there were variations

21

in the testimony of these men.

I am talking about the Solicitor

22

General's brief, that there were variations in their testimony,

23

that they had modified their testimony by their 1965 assertions

24

and the Solicitor General states that this change in their

25

testimony could justify the conclusion by the trial court that
65

1
2

other aspects of their testimony were also unworthy of belief.
Mow in Zenith's brief to this court, and I am referring

3

to pages 86 to 88 they quote from some of this same discredited

4

testimony about the distributor converting sets and asserts,

■S'

"There was no denial of this testimony, and there is

6

no other evidence in this record on the issue"where the other

7

evidence in the record on the issue is there, recanting that

8

testimony when they got to trial the second time.

3

Q

Mr. Chadwell, on the basis of some experience,
i

10

may I ash you really, these people were not cross-examined in

II

the first trial, were they?

12

A

They were the second trial.

13

Q

Now, on the second, what you call the second

14

Yes, sir.

trial which is the production of evidence --

15

A

Yes, sir.

16

Q

After the findings were made, pursuant to per­

17

mission of the Court, X take it your point must be that on

13

cross-examination which is really what it was,wasn't it, there

19

was no cross-examination in the first trial.

20

A

No cross-examination,

21

Q

And then substantially on cross-examination these

22

men testified as you have here narrated and perhaps at most

23

what you are trying to say to us is that things that were

24

brought out on cross-examination were more deviational, more

25

deviant from what they said on direct testimony than as a
66

I

?

common ordinary experience of lawyers and witnesses in the

2

trial of cases.

Isn’t that right?

o
o

A

It certainly is, your Honor.

4

Q

Because every time you examine a witness particu­

5

larly, on an expert subject of this sort, you bring out lots of |

6

facts that they don't adduce on their direct examination.

7

A

8

But I submit to your Honor that when they make state-

9

ments that are as flat as these were both times it is something

True.

i
i

to

more than you would normally expect to get by some modification

11

of their testimony.

12

Q

What is the reason for exercising the Canadian —

13

A

I think the reason is that when I started out I

14

wanted to show how they had buried their testimony with respect

15

to the English part and where we had a second hearing, or an

16

additional hearing, and did not have one on the Canadian part,

17

I wanted to show that because I think that had a bearing on the

10

decision of the Court of Appeals to reverse after reviewing the

19

entire record.

20

Because I think the Court had serious question as to

21

the credibility of the witnesses after noting the differences in

22

their testimony at the two hearings.

23

Q

Did the Court say so?

24

A

As I said, Mr. Chief Justice, they did not say so

25

except with respect to the second point and on that they said

67

1

that Zenith didn9t gain anything by putting in this testimony

2

concerning convertibility of the sets.

3

Q

And plus the fact

that the District Court saying
■

4

this again that after it was all through

with the second phase

of the case, nevertheless thought these two witnesses were

Yes.
But that judgment with respect to England —

13

Mr. Kayser is going to cover Canada is the reason I am not

14

doing that --

15

Q

I see.

16

A

But that testimony with respect to England was

17

all important to them.

13

Q

i
:
;

Are you going to argue that given their testimony

19

even as changed the second time but given the truth of it that

20

nevertheless they are not entitled that the proof was insuf­

21

ficient to show the impact, the fact of damage?

22

A

Yes, sir.

And the reason is that --

23

Q

Which course did the Court of Appeals take do

24

you suppose?

Assuming that their testimony was correct, and

25

nevertheless they didn't prove damage or -68

A
correct.

No.

No, they did not assume their testimony was

As a matter of fact they held that the real reason

that Zenith did not export to England was that they were
waiting for a change by the British Government in the television
standards from the 405 to the 625 line which was an exceedingly
important change which made obsolete all television sets unless
they were converted at considerable expense and the fact of the
matter is that during the damage period -- in fact in 1961 in
the middle of the damage period — Ramsey wrote to Zenith and
reported on the continued testing and examination of the 625
line standard ——
Q

Is the Court of Appeals bound to view the testi­

mony An a case like this in the light most favorable to the -A

No, sir.

And that is a fact I would like to

discuss which is brief although Mr. McConnell did not refer to
it, I think that the Court was right in relying upon the decision
of the Gypsum case and that a finding is clearly erroneous when
— although there is evidence to support it — the reviewing
court on the entire record is left with a definite and firm
conviction that a mistake has been committed.
Now that is the rule that has been follox^ed in a
question of the power of the Court of Appeals to reverse a
decision of the trial court since the DuPont decision which I
believe was some 25 years ago.
Now the

contention is raised here that the jury rule
69

1

should apply in this case despite the fact that this was a case

2

tried by the court and without a jury.

3

Mr. McConnell also has made that contention and that

4

I assume I think also the suggestion of the Solicitor General.

5

But there is no doubt at all that Rule 52a makes the provision

6

that I have referred to.

7

the decision in the Gypsum case the rule is that the Court of

3

Appeals has the right to reverse even though there is some

9

evidence to support the findings when they are left with this

There is no doubt at all that under

to

definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,

11

and the Court stated that it was left with a definite and firm

12

conviction that a mistake had been committed.

13

And I must say that the Government as much as admits
'

14

that applying the standard, the established standard, under 52a

15

as stated in the Gypsum case that the Court of Appeals was

16

right in reversing on that ground if you assume that that

17

ground is the correct one.

IS

Q

Did they testify before the judge?

19

A

Yes, sir, they did.

A

He

Q

all that it means.

A Court of Appeals, your

relying is on an old volume.

I understand that you are relying

24

on and that the Court of Appeals had a right to set. that aside

25

and it did so on the basis that you are arguing now.
70

j

t

A

Yes, sir.

2

Q

Largely because of their belief that these two
*

3

witnesses were not critical?
A

Well, I don't think it was only that, Mr. Justice

6

Q

Well, I said largely.

7

A

Well, I think another very important point to

5

Black.
That is all right.

8

the Court of Appeals and in fact they said so is that there was

9

the delay or complete failure to do anything about shipping

10

sets to England because they were awaiting the change to the

il

625 line broadcast system.

12

And the correspondence shows that.

The contemporan­

13

eous correspondence shows it without any question of a doubt.

14

That is what they wrote back and forth about it.

15

was a firm statement by Mr. Ramsay that they could not import

16

and sell until the change was made.

17

Finally there

Nothing could be clearer that there was a contempo­

18

raneous document, contemporaneous correspondence directly

19

contradicting and directly contrary to the theory that Zenith

20

was interested in and wanted to import to or

21

during the damage period.

The reason that they stayedout of England is clear, it is un­

correspondence denies that.

It was denied by Mr. Wright.

credibility of the witnesses?

Gypsum isn't such a case?

A

Well, in the Jackson case which was just decided

16

by the Court of Appeals by the District in 1965, and it dis­

17

cussed at pages 82 to 83 of our main brief, says that a question

18

of credibility doesn't depend necessarily, entirely on demeanor.

19

It depends on whether the testimony is inconsistent with known

20

facts as well.

21

It depends on whether it is inconsistent with con­

22

temporaneous documents, it depends on whether it is inherently

believable.

This is a non-jury test?
75

That is what they said

A

Yes, sir.

2

Q

And in a jury case it would be different?

3

A

Oh, yes.

A jury case is different.

This is a

non-jury case.

Gypsum case is what controls and 1 think this Court can consider

6

whether the Court of Appeals did that.

And I say that Rule 52a plus the decision in the

they find as to each one of the three pools, all of which is

could point to anything else.
Q

Well, now, how much of the record — it is about

this high (indicating) — do you think we have got to look at?
A

Well, I would think that you would have to do

14

the job that the Court of Appeals has done in order to decide

15

whether they were right or wrong in what they did.

19
20

Q

Well, that sounds to me like doing over again

what they did.
A

Well, we point out in our briefs I think what the

record shows on these things.
Q

Mr. Chadwell, as a result of your argument on the

21

embargo in England, do you want us to hold that they are entitle 3

22

to no damages or do you want us to hold that the damages should

23
24
25

be diminished?

I raise the fact that they had not planned to

build up any business while the embargo was in effect.
A

I think that there should be no damages because
76

i

the evidence does not show through findings or through evidence

2

what the damage should be on this other theory.

3

show it and that is pointed out in the Government's brief* where

4

they are recommending remanding for further testimony on these

5

points.

It does not

6

Q

Is that agreeable to you?

7

A

Well, we think that it is not necessary to do

8

that.

We think that on the decision of the Court of Appeals

based upon these contemporaneous records as to England, based
10

upon the facts as to Canada, which Mr. Kayser will discuss, and

n

based upon the fact that in Australia there was never any effort

12

to get down there at all that amounted to anything.
Since 1951 anyone could have had an import license

13
14

into Australia.

There has been no problem about it whatsoever.

15

Is that conclusion based upon the fact that we

18

ought to wipe out of our consideration the testimony of these

17

two men?
A

18

I think you have got to consider it against the

19

other testimony in the record and the other facts.

2

as to England how in the world the general statements of these

21

men can be credited against or over contemporaneous documents

22

exactly to the contrary.

23
24
25

I don't see

That is what exists here.

Q

But there was no embargo during the statutory

That is right.

period.

77

1

Q

Well now, they do contend, do they not, that the

2

pool prevented them from doing business in England during the

3

statutory period?

4

A

During the damage period.

5

Q

Yes, damage period.

6

Why should we wipe out the

testimony so far as that is concerned?
A

7

Because that testimony is contradicted by their

3

contemporaneous documents to the contrary, as I have just said.

3

This correspondence in 1961 -- *

10

Q

When do those contemporaneous documents come in?

1!

A

They came in from ---

12

Q

No, when did they come into this record?

13

A

Oh, into this record.

14

They were offered by

Zenith counsel in a bulk package at the first hearing.

15

Q

Were they admitted then?

16

A

They were admitted then.

17

And there are a great

number of these letters and we cite them in our brief.

There

'

18

are some that we have made an offer of proof with respect to

19

because they had not been introduced.

They are in the record
j

20
21

as an offer of proof.
The document that I just referred to, written in 1961,

22

in which it was said that we can't start selling in England

23

until they change the broadcast standard, the 625 line.

24

is in evidence and was put in evidence by Zenith counsel.

25

Q

That

Mr. Chadwell, since it is true in this case that
78

1

the case was closed, findings of fact were issued and you had it

2

reopened for the purpose of takixxg additional proof.
Would it, on the basis of that, be just as fair for

3
4

us to adopt the Government's position and remand this case?
A

3

Well, I think this Court can certainly do that.

G

It seems

7

now about England, that you have got to weigh the contemporan­

8

eous documents against what they said.

9

I don’t see how the Court can coma to any conclusion except that

When you weigh the two

to me that on the record as I have stated it, speaking

You think we must do that in reference to the

Canadian judgment, in reference to the English judgment?

13

A

Yes, sir.

14

Q

Because you think an argument is better in one

15

than

the other or why could we not decide in favor of one and

16

not in the other?

17

A

Well, of course, you could,

19

Xsxx’t there

a difference?
A

20

Well, they are entirely different.

They are

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

Mr. Kayser.

1

ARGUMENT OF VICTOR P. KAY5ER, ESQ.

2

OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. KAYSER:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
Before getting to the subject of Canada, I would like

5
6

to devote just another minute on the subject of England, and I

7

think possibly clarify what may be somewhat of a misunder­

8

standing .

9

The fact is that as to England the testimony of

10

Wright and Kaplan which had formed the basis of the findings

1!

was two-fold.

12

First the testimony about having been kept out of

13

England by the pools for many years which was disproved by the

14

later proof of the embargo, this was one part of their factual

15

damage theory as to England that the pools kept them from

16

developing a market by June '59 from which developed market

$7

they could then profit.

18

And then the second part of that assertion was that

19

in fact during the four years they were interested and intent

20

in going in England and the testimony that Mr. Chadwell has

21

referred to, having to do with the contention they built a few

22

sets or converted a few sets and that the English distributor

23

had tried to sell them, that evidence had been put in to .indi­

24

cate interest in the English market.

25

And that was the evidence that they relied on to show
80

1

interest and readiness to go into the English market during that

2

four-year period.

O
o

Now, when they got back on the stand and ware forced

4

to admit that that testimony was not true, they wars forced to

5

admit it because we had taken the distributor's deposition and

6

he admitted that there was nothing to it.

7

When they were forced to admit that there was nothing

8

to their original testimony, that did two things.

9

seriously impaired, we admit, their credibility on all aspects

10

but secondly it knocked out the second of the two aspects upon

11

which their English claim was based.

12

No. 1, it

So at that point in fact they have no evidence in

13

this record on which to base any claim as to England other than

14

they had this question of Exhibit 220.

15

drawn from that, which I will come to later.

The inferences to be

16

Secondly, before going into Canada, I would like to

17

answer the questions or respond to the inquiries this morning

18

as concerns the matter of a release.

19

Q

Nov/, if I--

Excuse me, Mr. Kayser, before you get to that,

20

may I interrupt you.

21

is that with respect to England on your Point 2 as you have

22

just stated it, it says if Zenith were a stranger that this is

23

the only evidence in the record that goes to their desire to do

24

business in England, their readiness and ability to do business

25

in England, when absent the alleged restraints?

X take it that what you are really saying

81

1

A

Yes.

2

Q

And that this evidence with respect to the set

3

conversion,, convertibility of the sets, being refuted ---

Well, now suppose we should disagree with you on

10

that, without getting into the subtleties of that, statement, if

1?

we should disagree with you on that, I take it neither you nor

12

Mr. Chadwell is submitting to us, that the patent pool, you are

13

not trying to defend the legality under the antitrust law3 of

14

the patent pool in Hazeltine's participation in it?
A

15

I would like to answer that in two parts if I

16

may.

No. 1, I should say that on the point of intent to enter

17

there is in addition to the fact that they repudiated, they

18

recanted their testimony, there is also as Mr. Chadwell has

19

said, there is the documentation in the record from Zenith’s

20

own bulk exhibit which clearly showed that during this entire

21

period they were waiting for the perspective change of the

22

broadcast standard.

23

Q

I understand that.

24

A

On the second question, the fact is that we, as

25

You have mads that clear.

shown in our brief, entirely aside from any other aspect, we
82

1

believe that the record shows that from January 1958 on, if

2

they in fact had had an interest in entering the English market

3

thatfrom then after the embargo and through the damage period

4

they could have obtained a license.
They never inquired for a license.

5
6

They could have

had a license.
Q

7

I want to be very clear on one

thing.

Are you,

8

or are you not arguing that the English pool — let us taka that

9

A, and B the Canadian pool — are lav/ful, are not unlawful with

10

respect to the participation of Hazeltine therein?
A

11

We, frankly, your Honor, as we have seen this

12

case, we have not seen fit to go into that question, and we

13

consider that the issue of the fact of damage which was found

14

in favor of the Hazeltine Corporation by the Court of Appeals

15

is a threshold question.
Q

16

17

A

We do not.

But

we are not arguing it.

We

most certainly do not concede it.
Q

20
21

I understand your language.

X am not asking you to concede the illegality.

18
19

That is adequate.

What is your argument to the Court of Appeals on

that subject?
A

22

On the Court of Appeals, we frankly, your Honor,

23

we made a very brief argument.

We did defend the legality of

24

the pools.

25

our thrust was on the question, "Was Zenith in fact hurt?"

We believe that they are lawful but there again

83

And

1

also on the issue of the amount of damage as well as several

2

other issues.

3

Q

Could we take your briefs in the Court of Appeals

4

on the question of legality as the total of your argument here

5

if we come to that?

6
7

0

9

A

No, your Honor, as I said we did not brief it

exhaustive there and we have not briefed it exhaustively here.
Q

Well, I would have thought in the Court of

Appeals you would have to reach it exhaustively because you

10

have the findings against you and I would think that you would

11

want to prove to

12

if they v/ere legal.

13

A

the best of your ability that these were legal

Your Honor, we faced with the situation under

14

which we had been thrust there.

Frankly, we had to form a

15

judgment as to what emphasis to place.

16

the judgment of $34 million against him.

17

that irrespective of the question of legality which certainly

18

I need not say in an area like this is a very complicated area,

19

it was a matter of judgment to put our thrust where we thought

20

it was most clear that the judgments below were wrong.

We had a client who had
We felt he was clear

21

And that is what we did.

22

Now, on the issue of release I think — and I will

23

spend just a moment on that — but it should be clear that the

24

releases were in fact pleaded in the District Court by leave

25

of Court and before entry of judgment.
84

1

2

And we have covered that point in our reply to the
Solicitor General's brief where the point was made.

3

Also, I think it should be pointed out that on Zenith' s

4

reply brief filed in this court on page 16 Zenith admitted that

5

the trial court permitted the filing of the pleas, as of a

6

date a year after the trial, and then promptly overruled a

7

motion to dismiss the counter claims on these grounds.

8
9

The releases were in fact pleaded admittedly after the
original trial but before judgment by leave of the trial court.

10
11

Q

What was the reason they were not pleaded at

the first trial?

12

A

Your Honor, we were not counsel, but I think the

13

reason they were not pleaded at the first trial was because

14

under the theory of action which was set forth in the original

15

counter claim, there would have been no conceivable basis to

16

plead them, because as set forth in that counter claim and in

17

the affidavit of Mr. Crotty,

18

was recited that the acts complained of, which formed the

19

basis of this counter claim which was not filed until 1963,

20

three years after the answer, had taken place after the filing

21

of the answer.

one of counsel for Zenith, it

That was a span of three years before filing of the

22
23

answer

and I would submit that it would be quite obvious under

24

those circumstances the release would have no possible appli­

25

cability and it was only after, as we pointed out in our brief,

85

1

Zenith switched its action to claim not that the acts within

2

the past three years had caused damage but that by reason of

3

the acts going back to 1926, Zenith had been damaged by the

4

effect of those.

5

became applicable and at that time we got into the case, we

6

pleaded it and were permitted to plead it.

It wasn't until that point that the release

7

Now as to the question of Canada,, I think we must

fi

remember that the issue that we have here is whether or not

9

there was a damaging impact by the Canadian pool upon Zenith's

10

Canadian business during the four-year period.

11

of the testimony given by the Zenith

12

ultimate issue of question there is, tee believe, as the Solicito c

13

General correctly stated it.

14

And by reason

witnesses, the final

Namely, whether Zenith was unable to obtain a full-

15

fledged Canadian distribution system during the period from

16

June 1959 through May 1963, and if not whether such inability

17

was attributable to the actions of the Canadian pool.

18

That is the issue as to Canada as to fact of damage.

19

Now we have heard a great deal this morning about this alleged

20

gigantic international \tforld~wide conspiracy, and incidentally

21

the proofs and the findings do not support that, but in any

22

event we have heard that language about these alleged con­

23

spiracies or giant conspiracy.

24

Well, there are several observations to be made there.

25

First, Mr. McConnell has said, as to Canada, that its
36

1

evidence is almost entirely documentary and yes, it is.

2

it is all before 1957.

And

Secondly, I think we should remember that Zenith is

3
4

not entitled to any recovery here by reason of any alleged

5

illegality of the Canadian pool or any other pool or by reason

6

of any overt act which may have been done is entitled to

7

recovery, it is asking that it be paid money, it is entitled

8

to that only if it can show that there was an impact, a damaging

9

impact by those pools upon Zenith’s business during the four

10
11

years.
Now what does the record show incidentally as to

12

Canada after the 1957 releases?

It shows, yes, as Mr. McConnell

13

says, it shows that there was a trade builder ad in August 1958

14

warning about infringement, but it also shows, that Mr. Wright

15

sent a telegram and a letter, a strong letter, to the Canadian

IS

pool and said, "We are fully licensed under all Canadian patents

17

which the pool controls, that we consider this advertisement

18

detrimental, that if you ever send another one or issue another

19

one, we will see you in court."

And there never was.

20

Q

Did the pool directly communicate with Zenith?

21

A

No, Zenith communicated with the pool.

22

Q

Was Zenith ever warned that it required a license

23

from the pool to operate in Canada directly?

24

A

Well, directly, there were meetings.

25

Q

I thought we were told there was a communication
87

i

to Zenith in which there was a license for domestic production?

2

A

Yes.

Cut those communications, Mr. Justice White,

3

were between Zenith and the pool, not made known to the dis­

4

tributing public, but, yes, there were a couple of meetings and

5

there was, as Mr. McConnell has said,

6
7

Q

But the pool said stay out unless you are going

to build a factory up there?

8

A

9

Q

10

A

Which called for manufacture in Canada.

11

Q

Wasn't Zenith informed that the pool held con­

12

Wo, the pool sent Zenith a license form -For what?

trolling licenses, controlling patents for —

13

A

14

Q

15

A

No.
— which Zenith required a license?
No, that letter as I recall referred to three

16

patents, which it was believed — the letter said it v/as

17

believed — that Zenith would infringe.
Q

And in order to operate they needed those

20

A

Zenith said they didn!t need those

21

your Honor.

22

licensed and the fact of the matter is that Zenith entered the

23

Canadian market when they sold --

18
19

24
25

licenses?

Q

licenses,

Zenith took the position that it was fully

The pool's view was that you need something with

us before you can operate in Canada?
88

t

A

That was suggested.

2

Q

Not only suggested, but said.

3

A

4

It was said, yes.

And no action was ever taken.

Zenith continued to grow in Canada.

5

Q

Well, how did this suit get started?

6

A

This suit has absolutely nothing whatsoever to dc

7

with the foreign business of Zenith or with the Canadian pool,

3

the English pool or the Australian pool, and I think possibly

9

I would like to turn to that point since the question was

10
11

raised right now.
Because Mr. McConnell when he was asked on that ques­

12

tion said,yes, there was a finding to the effect that there was

13

a connection between the Instant Patent Suit and the Canadian

14

15

Q

16

A

He finally said it was on domestic production?

17

Yes, there was a connection. However, the number
%
of the finding he gave you, which I believe was 32, had abso­

18

lutely nothing to do with the domestic litigation.

19

Further the finding which Zenith itself submitted

20

and was entered in this case, Finding No. 13, after reciting

21

the domestic activities of Hazeltine Corporation, including a

22

reference to the Instant Suit, said that the injury to Zenith's

23

business and property from the domestic suit and these other

24

activities was $50,065, namely the cost of defending the liti­

25

gation and there wasn't a word in any of those findings which
89

1

in any way proported to connect the domestic situation or the

2

domestic suit with the Canadian situation.

3

And, in fact, not only is there nothing in the record

4

but when in the colloquy which I had with the trial court in

5

March on the reopening — that is referred to at page 126 to 127

6

of our brief — he made it quite apparent that in his opinion

7

he did not understand that there was any connection between the

0

domestic activities of Hazeltine Research and the foreign

9

activities of the Canadian pool.
And the Court of Appeals accordingly said quite cor­

10
11

rectly , we submit that there is no evidence in this record to

12

indicate any connection and that, in fact, the Appellate Court

13

never took that suggestion seriously.
Q

14

Well, that doesn't matter one way or the other,

15

does it?

Does it matter one way or the other with respect to

16

the outcome of this suit?
Whether this suit grew out of a domestic controversy

17
18

or a controversy that had its origins related to the foreign

19

countries.

20

A

We don't think it does, your Honor, but Zenith

21

has argued that point in his brief3.

22

irrelevant.

23

We think it is totally

There is no connection.

To get back to the Canadian situation, the question

24

of this correspondence, the question of this Trade Builder ad,

25

it is apparent that Zenith never considered it offered a threat
90

1

to it because when it filed its answer in this case in April,

2

1960, some years to months later if it had felt that these acts

3

constituted a threat and damage to it, it would have been a

4

compulsory counter claim required at that time.

5

And there never was any such compulsory claim until

6

May, 1963, when they ascribed their damage solely to acts

7

occurring after April, 1960.

8
9
10

Now Wright was asked by his counsel as to exactly what
were the clouds or difficulties or effects which the alleged
activities of the pool had on Zenith's business in Canada.

It

Q

What about the distributors, anything to dispute

12

the fact that the distributors were contaminated by the alleged

13

conspiracy or whatever the word is?
A

Mr. Justice Marshall, this is part of my next

16

Q

Good.

17

A

Mr. Wright testified as to two alleged effects of

14

15

point.

18

the Canadian pool and its activities during the period and he

19

said they had to do with the holding back on advertising and

20

promotion, and they had an effect on the ability to get dis­

2!

tributors.

22

that testimony.

23

At least that is the way Zenith has characterized

Now on the first point of holding back on advertising

24

and promotion, I submit that that point is no longer in the case

25

because when we got Mr. Kaplan on the stand in November, 1965,
91

1

we asked him about Zenith's advertising in Canada, and he said

2

that it was typical to what you would expect in a new market,

3

in fact implied it was a bit larger and further Zenith's own

4

Exhibit 218 in this case shows that there were in fact sub-

5

stantial expenditures in advertising, radio, television, news­

6

papers, magazines, billboards; you name it, they used it.

7

The Government feels that it is indicated that they

G

recognize that this is out of the case and we most certainly

9

agree.

But I think it should be pointed out and the Court of

10

Appeals took

11

a witness, la<ter shown to be untrue, by his own fellow executive

12

note of this fact that this was evidence given by

We turn then to the second question, that of whether

13

or not Zenith was in fact unable to obtain a full fledged

14

Canadian distribution during the four-year period, and I submit

15

that is the crux of Zenith's entire claim as to Canada.

16

Now, Zenith asserts that Mr. Wright testified that he

17

tried to get distributors but he had problems.

18

some in Western Canada, but he couldn't get them in the other

19

portions of Canada because of the Canadian pool.

20

He could get

But actually if you read Mr. Wright's testimony very

21

closely you will see that even though someone might get that

22

impression he didn't say that.

23

effect that the August, 1958, Trade Builder ad, things of that

24

fact, would cause a serious problem in getting distributors.

25

But he never testified that in fact that there was

He made some comments to the

92

1

a single instance where he had failed to get a distributor or

2

where a distributor had left Zenith.
Q

3
4

Is there any finding

on that testimony in the

trial court?
A

5

No, your Honor, that is one of the things that

6

the Solicitor General pointed out, that you couldn’t tell what

7

the trial court's supposed theory was.

C

have been the theory that they could be awarded damages because

9

the pool for many years prior to that had prevented them from

10

And it may very well

building up a matured market.
The course, as we pointed out, that any damage based

11
12

on that theory is gone, is not relevant because of the 1957

13

releases.
Secondly, it is said that Wright testified that he

14
15

could get distributors in Western Canada but had troxible else­

16

where.

17

he said was that they could get distributors in Western Canada,

18

they had less success in the Central and Eastern Provinces

19

but didn’t say why.

20
2!

But the fact is that if his testimony is

examined all

And as a matter of fact, as we shall show in a minute,
he didn't have trouble getting distributors anywhere in Canada.

22

Q

I didn't get that last statement.

23

A

We shall show in a minute the fact is that Zenith

24

did not have difficulty getting distributors.

25

were boasting they had a nation-wide network of distributors
93

By 1959 they

2

as X shall show in a moment, was not true.

3
4

Q

So Wright's testimony,

What did the courts find on that question as to

whether that testimony was true?

5

A

6

this pre-1957 period.

7

relies on, this very broad conclusory finding about drastic

0

curtailment.

9

Q

Not as I recall, no, the findings had to do with
But there was, of course, as Zenith

Mr. Kayser, may X ask you this.

I wonder if the

10

question before us on this branch of the case could be phrased

11

this way.
Was there a basis for the trial court concluding that

12

13

on account of threats by the pool to prevent the importation

14

into Canada of products, Zenith products, manufactured in the

15

United States, Zenith was deterred, prohibited, prevented from

16

shipping its products into Canada and selling

17

there?

18

those products

No. 1.
No. 2.

Because of the activities of the pool in

19

Canada, that distributor that Zenith was unable to obtain a

20

full-fledged distribution system that you have put it, and that

21

Zenith inferred that was there an adequate basis for the court

22

conclusion that Zenith wanted to and but for, but for the

23

activities of the pool, either with respect to prohibiting

24

forbidding importation or with respect to threats against

25

distributors, Zenith would have distributed and sold its

94

1

2
3
4

product in Canada.
Isn't that about what it comes down to in this branch
of the case?
You have got two points, one the pool Finding 29 with

5

respect to the pool activities in prohibiting importation of

6

product made in the United States and, two, the distribution

7

system, and either of those at this remote distance I suggest

8

to you it arguably might support a finding that the pool has

9

damaged Zenith in violation of antitrust laws.

10
11

12

And then the question is, has it demonstrated what
the amount of damage is and if so, what is that?
A

Well, your Honor, I don't believe I can agree

13

that there was a record which would justify any conclusion of

14

the fact of damage.

15

Because, granted a pool policy, we nevertheless have

16

the fact that Zenith considered itself fully licensed, took

17

that position and was never in any way interfered.

18

Q

Well, as I think my brother, was developed in

19

the colloquy with my brother, White, the pool nevertheless took

20

the position that it would not permit the importation of Zenith

21

products in Canada.

22

factory, but however it may be I am not asking you to agree to

23

the conclusion right now, Mr. Kayser, but is this a correct

24

analysis of issues before us?

25

Zenith could go up there and start a

That is to say, that whether there is an adequate
95

1

basis for the District Court's findings on pool prohibition of

z

importation, whether there is an adequate basis for what is

3

arguably implicit in the District Court's findings, namely that

4

the pool threatened distributors and, third, whether there is

5

an adequate basis for the finding that but for these restraints

6

Zenith would have sold its product in Canada.

7

Are those the issues before us?

8

A

9

I would think so, Mr. Justice, depending on what

you mean by adequate basis.

I think certainly there is the

10

issue as to the effect of Rule 52a, but striking aside from

11

that, yes.

12

Now, I would like then to come back to this matter

3

of alleged inability to get distributors.

4

General in his brief recognized that the proof on this issue,

5

I believe he recognised that it was lacking or certainly of very

6

low standard, and he made the comment "No person can be certain

7

whether Zenith would have been able to obtain a Canadian-wide

8

group of distributors notwithstanding the pool,"

9

Now the Solicitor

He made that as a comment and as a justification and

20

as an argument for possibly supporting the decision of the

21

District Court.

22

But may it please the Court, this brings us to the

23

subject of Zenith’s annual reports which yet arenot in evidence

24

but they were in existence, they were in an offer of proof,

25

made before entry of judgment, they are in the transcript before
96

t

this Court, we believe and Mr. McConnell recognizes the Court

c«

o

may take judicial notice of them, and we believe, respectfully,

3

that they are inescapable unless the truth is to be ignored.

4

I think, respectfully, that there is a very basic

5

question presented here.

6

7

Granted, that these annual reports
That is undeniable.

But the fact is that these are contemporaneous docu­

3

ments out of the Zenith files, they are the highest record

9

of its stewardship to its shareholders, and they directly con­

10

11
12

tradict the testimony of the Zenith witnesses if they be con­
strued as Zenith says they should be.
And under the decision of this Court in U.S. versus

13

DuPont, that when contemporaneous documents, admissions of this

14

type, conflict with the later oral testimony of the witness,

15

then it was said the contemporaneous documents must control.

16

Now on this question was Zenith able to obtain a

17

full-fledged Canadian distribution system during the damage

18

period, what do the annual reports say?

it unequivocally unless we are told that the annual reports are

Mr. Justice White, I would like to

come to that 5 percent question.

6

Q

Good.

7

A

I believe it was your Honor who suggested that

8

possibly this was the evidence ultimately on which Zenith must

‘3

rely or seeks to rely as to Canada.

10

Namely, Exhibit 220 which

is reproduced in our brief opposite page 20.
Now that Exhibit 220, and I will explain the back­

11

32

ground testimony, shows that Zenith asserted that it was

13

entitled to claim as its share of the market beginning from the

14

first day of the damage period, June 1, 1959, the benefits of

15

a share of the Canadian market equal to the share which it had

16

realised through its many years of activity here in the United

17

States.

18

Here, Zenith has been in radio since the 20's I

19

believe and has been in television since the late 40's.

20

this Exhibit 220 was premised on the theory that Zenith should

21

claim the entire claim, roughly 20 percent share of the market

22

based on the notion its market should equal its U.S. market.

23

But what was that theory based on?

So

It was based on

24

the theory that the Canadian pool going back for many,many

25

years, back to 1926, had been in there keeping Zenith products
98

1

out.

2

therefore, because of those acts, they were entitled to claim

3

the benefits of a fully-developed market.

And kept them from building up the market share and that

4

But, of course, the fact of the matter is that the

5

1957 release released not only past damages but also future

6

damages resulting from any of those acts going back from 1926

7

to 1957.

17

A

And incidentally, the Court of

18

Appeals did make reference to the release in its opinion.
Q

19

You say the annual report indicates that Zenith

20

itself was saying that we wouldn't have any more than this

21

strong distribution system absent the pool?

22

that way.

23

A

I don't read it

Your Honor, given the proposition that Zenith

24

in making its claim in having a market starts from scratch.

25

Would have to start, we say, from scratch in 1957, because of
99

1

these releases.

I submit that these annual reports in this

2

offer absolutely destroy any notion that with that starting

point Zenith did not do as well as it could have.

In fact these reports, to the shareholders, to the

5

public, are an extended story of success after success after

20

Q

I said properly.

21

A

Yes, but I don’t think it means anything.

22

But these annual reports, v/hich I say are the highest

report of the corporation of its stewardship to its share­

holders, what do they saiy?

25

I have pointed out that they say they had the

is that these reports, beginning in 1957 are really a very, very

20

are in direct conflict either with the testimony of the wit­

the problem of the tariff in Canada, exchange control, ratio.

5

So it really is a very, very revealing history.

Well,

6

now I would like to spend my remaining 4-1/2 minutes on behalf

7

of the Hazeltine Corporation raising the jurisdiction of the

a

question which is also before this court.

o

briefly and will make only the points as quickly as I can.

10

I must do so very

First, that Hazeltine Corporation a .parent was never

11

named a party to the litigation, was never served with process,

12

never filed an appearance and the litigation was solely between

13

Hazeltine Research and Zenith Radio.

14

The only proported basis for holding the parent liable

15

was the stipulation entered into May 7, .1963, and as Mr. McConne 11

16

himself said this morning, that stipulation was between the

17

parties, namely Hazeltine Research and Zenith, and Hazeltine

13

Corporation was never a party to it.

19

And it should be noticed also that in the counter

20

claim filed in this case which was some three weeks after the

21

stipulation, although Zenith referred to Hazeltine Corporation

22

as the parent, it never named it as a party and in fact in the

23

claim for judgment for treble damages, a judgment was asked

24

only, a judgment against counter-defendant Hazeltine Research,

25

never Hazeltine Corporation.
102

1

Noxv, the fact is also that both Zenith and the trial

2

courtknew that Hazeltine Corporation was not before the court.

3

Zenith, in its brief, constantly distinguished between the

4

parent and the subsidiary, said that Mr. Dodds represented the

5

subsidiary, not the plaintiff.

6

The trial judge himself in a colloquy when X raised

7

the question that Hazeltine Corporation was not a party, what

8

did Judge Austin say?

9
10

"Well, of course, Hazeltine Corporation wasn't a party
to the lawsuit."

n

That is the trial judge speaking.

12

Now, finally, and I think this is really very sig­

13

nificant in this picture, the first time Hazeltine Corporation

14

even knew that there was any thought that it was to be bounded

15

by the judgments was the day after the original findings calling

16

for the enormous award of $49 million were entered, and that

17

Hazeltine Corporation heard about it over a Dow-Jones tape

18

to the effect that Zenith's counsel has advised that he intends

19

to ask that Hazeltine Corporation be bound by the judgment.

»

20

The reason for this, I suggest, is obvious.

These

2!

findings for $49 million were 15-16 times the net worth of

22

Hazeltine Research.

23

total assets of Hazeltine Corporation and its subsidiaries.

24
25

In fact, substantially greater than the

But at least Hazeltine Corporation had more assets
than Hazeltine Research and, therefore, Zenith decided at that
103

i

point that the judgment

They succeeded in getting the trial court to do that, even

3

though the trial court himself had admitted that Hazeltine

Corporation wasn't a party to the lawsuit.
